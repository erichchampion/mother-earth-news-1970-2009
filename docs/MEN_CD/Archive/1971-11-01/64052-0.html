        FAR ABOVE: The Society of Brothers commune appears far from the maddening crowd . . . although located on the edge of U.S. 40 near New Meadow Run, Pennsylvania. The Society maintains two other locations in the United States. ABOVE: The whole world, beginning with the community's front lawn, is a classroom for the Society's children.
