                          <p>        (1) These "strict regulations" of the Atomic Energy        Commission are currently the subject of a growing, heated        debate in many states where nuclear plants are being        constructed and operated. According to many scientists in        the specialized field of health physics, the AEC        regulations on radioactive discharges from nuclear power        reactors are far too tolerant for the safety of persons        living in the vicinity of nuclear plants.      </p>      <p>        The Minnesota state government is currently suing to        insure that the radioactive discharges from the        Monticello atomic plant will be lessened by a tremendous        factor from the AEC limits. A number of states have        joined Minnesota in the suit.      </p>            <p>        Many long-time supporters of the AEC are now taking a        second look at reactor standards. At a recent national        conference on radiation safety, Harry Ashe of the Vermont        Department of Health stated: "I think the current AEC        standards can be lowered.... They should be lower than        they are at present." Ashe's comments are typical of        state health officials who have indulged in lengthy        criticism of nuclear critics in the past, but who now are        concerned over the AEC's safety measures.      </p>      <p>        The primary concern of health officials is the        possibility of radiation damage to persons in the        vicinity of the plants from allowable radiation pollution        under "normal" operating conditions. Of the sixteen        nuclear power plants currently operating in the United        States, the degree of damage from this pollution is        unknown. No comprehensive monitoring program of nuclear        facilities has been carried out by the Atomic Energy        Commission, though yearly records of the amounts of        radioactive materials released to the environment are        published.      </p>            <p>        According to the Public Health Service, the Humboldt Bay,        California, atomic plant released 900,000 curies of        radioactive gases into the air in 1967 and 897,000 curies        in 1968. These amounts account for about two-thirds of        the AEC "permissible limit". Barry Commoner, in        <strong>Politics and Environment,</strong> comments: "The        meaning of these numbers can be inferred from the facts        that one curie represents the amount of radioactivity        emitted by one gram of radium, and that before the advent        of nuclear power, the total world supply of refined        radium was less than ten grams."      </p>      <p>        (2) This is perhaps the probing question the industry        should be asking. Say, for example, to the AEC's Advisory        Committee on Reactor Safeguards, whose chairman, Joseph        Hendrie, said in November, 1969, "The Committee has been        recently informed that overall reactor safety funding for        FY [fiscal year] 1970 and 1971 will be considerably below        the AEC estimates of need . . . .As a consequence, many        safety research activities have not been initiated, have        been slowed, or have been terminated. <em>The</em>        <em>Committee reiterates its belief in the urgent need        for additional research and development in these        areas.</em> [emphasis supplied]."<br />      </p>            <p>        AEC safety precautions are being challenged by experts in        the field of nuclear engineering and also by physicians        and health officials. Typical of the criticism is this        passage from the latest edition of the <em>Disaster        Handbook,</em> edited by Garb and Eng, a reference guide        for the medical profession: "The possible causes of a        nuclear reactor accident include errors in design or        construction, human errors in handling the reactor,        inadequate consideration of the effects of aging on the        reactor and its components, and deliberate sabotage.        Contributory causes may be the overoptimistic statements        and press releases of AEC officials on the safety of        their operations."      </p>      <p>        The AEC published a study of the possible consequences of        serious reactor accidents in 1957. It was summarized in a        December, 1969, publication issued by Maryland's        "Governor's Task Force on Nuclear Power Plants." The        maximum possible consequences indicate that 3,400 persons        would be killed, 43,000 would be injured and the property        damage and costs would be astronomical. For example,        agricultural restrictions might have to be placed on a        150,000 square mile area, at a cost of $4 billion.      </p>      <p>        The existence of a newer version of this study was        announced in 1965 which was supposed to indicate maximum        danger possibilities for the power plants of the 1970's,        plants that are several times larger than the ones        examined in the 1957 AEC report. This report was buried        by the AEC, and has not been released. Most observers        speculate that its contents would be "unfavorable" to the        growth of the nuclear industry.      </p>            <p>        <br />      </p>            <p>        <br />        (3) This may sound true and convincing, but in practice,        the opposite result is frequently found. For example, the        radioactive waste pollution from a commercial nuclear        facility in New York is now exceeding recommended safety        guidelines, but the AEC is doing nothing to stop it.      </p>      <p>        The plant, owned by Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (a        subsidiary of the Getty Oil Company) is currently        polluting several public bodies of water in New York with        deadly radioactive fission products. he most recent New        York State "Radioactivity Bulletin," issued by the Public        Health Department, lists water radiation levels in        Cattaraugus County which are almost ten times above the        AEC limit.      </p>      <p>        According to Congressman Lester Wolff of New York, the        AEC proposes to spend "eight times as much for its own        internal bureaucracy,'' as it will on regulation of        nuclear facilities this year.      </p>      <p>        <br />        (4) Although the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy does        hold public hearings regularly, information presented        that runs contrary to accepted AEC policy has little        chance of influencing the JCAE's recommendations. The        Joint Committee distributes a good deal of material on        nuclear energy from its plush, penthouse headquarters in        the Capitol building in Washington; most booklets are        from the AEC, but certain tracts are printed by the        nuclear industry's public relations center, the Atomic        Industrial Forum. One AEC booklet, written by James        Ramey, one of the five AEC Commissioners, describes        environmental critics of atomic development as        unfortunates suffering from a "hogwash syndrome." So much        for the "watchdog function" of JCAE.      </p>            <p>        <br />        (5) Guidelines on radiological protection set by the        Federal Radiation Council are often not followed by the        AEC. Last spring, the AEC argued before the Joint        Committee on Atomic Energy that occupational        uranium-miner exposures should be gradually lowered, so        the industry would not be set back. The FRC opted for a        stronger, more immediate reduction of occupational        radiation exposure. Such a clear-cut bias in favor of        industry over public health is not unusual. The radiation        guidelines themselves are twosided, one set for        occupational exposures (such as miners and workers in the        nuclear industry), and the other for the general        population.      </p>      <p>        <br />        Although it is true that the "nuclear power plants are        probably the most carefully studied" industry, it remains        to be demonstrated that they are "rigidly supervised."        The numerous examples of AEC negligence in the past        cannot be expected to disappear overnight.      </p>            <p><br />        One of this country's best ecology magazines is        ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION and one of the best features in EA        is called Debunking Madison Avenue . . . in which a        nationally-published advertisement is printed, then        picked apart with a very sharp weapon (the truth).
