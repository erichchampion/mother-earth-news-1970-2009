                    <h5 id="byline">      By DOYCE M. PURCELL    </h5>            		<p>Not long ago the ruggedest, most versatile      farm utility vehicle made anywhere was the pickup truck      manufactured by the American automotive industry. Like most      Detroit brain children, it was a mother-bear to work on . .      . but the body was solid enough to withstand the most      abusive treatment and the springs-designed for      shouldering brawny loads down back roads-could put      kinks in your backbone.		</p>		<p>Recently, though, the American      pickup truck has been transformed into a glorified town      car. Its body is now tinnier, chromier, more sculptured . .      . and the springs have been softened so much in an effort      to make the vehicle suitable for Miss America to drive to      the boat dock that, today, a new "stock" pickup is hardly      qualified to haul a load of feathers to a comfort factory.      But, to be fair, the machine's engine has been improved and      somebody up there has actually begun to think about us poor      devils who have to work on the monster.		</p>		<p>Now, if you've never owned a real working vehicle of any kind, you might      not realize just how important that last point-which      I call "maintenance potential"-can be. In truth,      though, the maintenance potential (how easily and      economically a machine can be repaired by its owner) is of      supreme importance to anyone buying a new or used pickup .      . . especially if the buyer will be operating the vehicle      in a remote area and/ or on a limited budget.		</p>		<p>To determine the MP of a pickup, first compare the size of the truck's      engine with the size of the vehicle's engine compartment.      Look at the clearance between the firewalls and the engine      (bearing in mind that clear space equals easier working      conditions every time you're forced to make an adjustment      or replace something).		</p>		<p>Next, concentrate on the manner in      which the engine and its accessories are arranged within      that space. Is everything packed tightly into a confusing      maze? That sort of efficiency can cause you to move half      the engine to get at the generator or adjust the carb . . .      and will cost you time and barked knuckles (if you do your      own repairs) or money (if you hire it done). Either way, it      certainly takes the joy out of even minor maintenance.		</p>		<p>Is the engine a six cylinder or a V-8? An eight has its uses      on a drag strip but there are several arguments against it      in a utility vehicle. For one, it's a hard dude to work on.      An eight also has more moving parts to replace than a six      and the arrangement of those parts generally makes for a      lot more grunting and straining when repair time rolls      around. And then there's the eight's greater appetite for      fuel.		</p>		<p>On the other hand, the six has its problems also, the      greatest of which is lack of power when it comes to      muscling into the tougher jobs.		</p>		<p>The best compromise is often what is known as the "truck-six". This is the engine      designed especially for 3/4-ton and larger trucks. As built      by most major companies, the powerplant ranges in the      neighborhood of 300-cubic inches, has enough guts to walk      right through the toughest jobs and is built to last. These      durable mills almost always have five main bearings instead      of the three considered sufficient on most automobile      engines . . . which reduces wear on the crankshaft, rod      bearings and main bearings themselves.		</p>		<p>Obviously, a truck-six engine will probably be your first choice      but-V-8, six or truck-six-every powerplant must      be judged on its own merits. No need to jump in any      direction yet. Might as well check out a few of the finer      points while you have your head under that hood.		</p>		<p>Look at the position of the distributor and the nut underneath      which must be loosened to adjust the engine's timing. Is      the nut easily accessible or will it take an extension      elbow to reach it? Is the distributor itself in such a      position that you can time the ignition alone . . . or will      you need another person to move the blamed thing while you      operate a timing light?		</p>		<p>      If you can see the fuel pump, can you get a wrench on it?      Open, box-end or socket? Using an open or box on a long      bolt can be a royal pain, especially when you're running      short of daylight or a storm is approaching.		</p>		<p>What about the water pump? Will you have to remove the radiator to change      it? And the bolts that hold it in place . . . ask yourself      the same questions about them that you asked about the      bolts on the fuel pump.		</p>		<p>By now you're getting the general idea. If you buy this truck, you're the one who's going to      have to work on it, love it and take care of it. That      knowledge kind of gives you a more critical eye as you look      the vehicle over, doesn't it?		</p>		<p>OK. Now check the maintenance      potential of the seldom-considered <em>bottom</em> side of      the truck. Crawl underneath and take a look at the bolts      which hold the crankcase on. Can you get to all of them      with a tool of some kind? A careful look will tell you a      lot about whether or not you want to own this pickup. The      crucial question is: <em>can you drop the oil pan without      pulling the engine?</em> On a number of models you can't      and, in that case, you probably won't want the truck.		</p>		<p>In the same manner, if the drive shaft from the engine to the      real wheels is enclosed above the frame, you'll have      trouble dropping it to pull the transmission or to replace      the universal joints. The situation is roughly equivalent      to that of a dentist telling you that your teeth are all      right . . . but your gums have got to come out.		</p>		<p>So much for a quick check of the maintenance potential of the vehicle      you're considering. Another area that's extremely important      in a farm pickup is is hauling capacity . . . a subject      which covers a very wide range of non-standard      characteristics. If you're buying your first utility      vehicle, chances are you're not familiar with these      characteristics and you'll only notice them when you don't      want to. That is, when they get in the way or when you need      them and they're not there.		</p>		<p>First off, pickups come under      two tonnage designations: 1/2-ton and 3/4-ton. These      quick-and-easy tag names used by Detroit tell you only that      the second is larger than the smaller. That's all the names      mean. Trucks in both categories-properly      outfitted-are capable of hauling immeasurably more      than three-quarters of a ton. Other pickups-again, in      both categories-are often unsafe carrying a load half      that size. The difference depends, in large part, on the      tires and springs with which the truck is equipped.		</p>		<p>But tires are tires, right? Wrong! In fact, there is such an      incredibly diffuse selection of tires-made from      different materials, in different sizes, different plys and      different ply "equivalents"-now on the market that      this piece could easily turn into a book about tires. Let      me over-simplify, then, and say only that you'll be wise to      make certain your pickup is mounted on truck-not      automobile-tires that are rated for the largest total      gross weight at which you ever expect your vehicle to tip      the scales . . . <em>plus</em> a generous margin for error,      wear, etc. In general, too, the bigger in diameter the      wheels and tires are, the better they'll be for lugging      around heavy loads . . . assuming, of course, the truck's      springs will take those loads.		</p>		<p>I favor 16" wheels because      they offer more ground clearance than fifteen inchers. And,      since the 16" tires range from six to sixteen ply, the body      of one of the heavier tires will have a longer life than      the tread and can be safely recapped almost forever. As a      second choice, there <em>are</em> some very good trucktype      fifteen inch wheels and tires. They don't come as standard      equipment on 1/2-ton trucks but they are available and      they're worth every extra penny you pay for them. You might      also consider buying only mud-grip or snow tires for the      back country. They don't hold up as well at highway speeds      but they can't be beat for getting away from it all.    </p>            		<p>Today's      "standard" half-ton pickup is a second cousin to the family      car but a 3/4-ton is half-brother to real, no-nonsense,      hauling trucks. From the outside, it's hard for some      first-timebuyers to tell one from the other. The      difference, however, is worthy of note . . . even      if-as is generally the case-that difference      happens to lie in out-of-sight places.		</p>		<p>Not so out-of-sight      are the noticeably larger and heavier-duty engine,      transmission and rear end on the 3/4-ton machine. Also      obvious are the standard 16" truck tires (the half-ton      comes equipped with automobile-type fifteen inchers). The      springs are hardier and heavier on the 3/4-ton, too. Miss      America wouldn't like the rougher ride that results but      you'll appreciate the greater hauling capability those      springs give you.		</p>		<p>Spring capacity is one of those      not-so-obvious things that represents an important      consideration no matter what size pickup you buy. Much of a      truck's utility depends on this capacity, so always try to      get the heaviest springs available (without necessarily      going to "overloads" unless you know you'll be doing a lot      of extremely heavy hauling). The bigger and heavier the      springs, the longer it'll be before they sag . . . and, in      the meantime, they'll give you a great deal of protection      on heavy jobs.		</p>		<p>By the way, coil springs are another one of      Detroit's inventions that are better left off a truck. They      sure enough give you a soft automobile-like ride . . . but      they aren't as strong or as durable as good leaf springs.		</p>		<p>      Another point to consider when you're figuring the hauling      capacity of a truck is the machine's wheel base: the      distance between the front and rear wheels. There are      strong arguments in favor of both the long and short wheel      base. Forget those arguments and let the specific use you      have in mind for your truck make the decision for you.		</p>		<p>      Trucks with a long wheel base generally ride more smoothly      on the road and-having a longer bed-have a      larger load capacity than those trucks with a short wheel      base. The long-legged vehicles are less maneuverable,      however . . . the longer distance between the sets of      wheels gives the machine a larger turning radius and tends      to make it more susceptible to "high centering", or      dragging its belly, in rough country.		</p>		<p>Short wheel base      trucks are easy to park and generally get around better in      both traffic and the boondocks than do their spaced-out      counterparts. The shorties are also better for jobs like      pulling stumps because they generally have more weight over      the rear wheels. But the bed on these sawed-off pickups      is-understandably-a couple of feet shorter too      and, if you put a tool box behind the cab, you'll find the      space left over hardly bigger than a car trunk.		</p>		<p>A small bed      on a pickup can be the largest single factor in determining      the truck's hauling capacity since a well-sprung and      wellmounted vehicle can haul a lot more of most things than      anyone could ever cram into even a long bed.		</p>		<p>Pickup beds      come in two basic sizes: wide and narrow. Each has a      specific purpose and each is available in 1/2 or 3/4-ton,      short or long wheel base.		</p>		<p>The walls of a narrow bed go      inside the truck's wheelwells, making the bed a      straight-sided, rectangular box. Grain, sand, feed and      other scoop-it-out-with-a-shovel materials are much easier      to unload from one of these beds since there's no      wheelwells sticking into the box to work around.		</p>		<p>For hauling anything other than loose loads, though, you'll      usually come out ahead with the wide bed. It has      considerably more room and is almost wide enough to let you      lie down in it crosswise. The wide bed also offers a lot      more storage space "back in" if you ever mount a camper on      such a pickup.		</p>		<p>Another seemingly unimportant (at least at      first glance) element of truck design is the position of      the spare tire. If the tire is mounted on the inside of      your pickup's box it can take up a lot of valuable hauling      space. If located on the outside of a narrow bed, the tire      may encourage a ripoff artist to lean against the vehicle's      side, work off the lugs and steal the wheel in broad      daylight.    </p>    <p>      Many of the newer trucks mount the spare under the bed.      This is a good place for it . . . unless you'll be working      your pickup in really rough country. Many times I've had to      use my spare tire as a base for the jack in order to get      the truck out of mud. If the extra wheel had been up under      the bed, I'd have been in a bad fix.    </p><p>The ideal place for the spare, if you have a choice, is    over the front bumper. There, it will offer some protection    in case of collision and it'll be completely out of the way    when you aren't using it, completely accessible when you are.    One caution, however: on some trucks it's necessary to mount    the extra wheel off center so it won't cause the vehicle to    overheat by unnecessarily blocking air flow to the machine's    radiator.		</p>		<p>A very important factor that buyers often overlook    while shopping for a truck is fuel capacity. This can be of    prime importance in the back country. Fuel tanks capable of    holding upward of 60 gallons are available as options on many    newer trucks and they're a good buy. They'll get you into    town in an emergency and-in the city-they can    carry you from gas war to gas war.		</p>		<p>Matter of fact, the whole    subject of fuel itself cannot be overlooked by anyone    shopping for a pickup. In some back areas of this country    (and certainly in rural Mexico) the best petroleum available    is little more than high-grade kerosene. Needless to say,    high compression engines don't function well on such a brew    so steer clear of high compression equipment on your    homestead vehicle. Even with severely retarded timing, many    of today's Detroit mills will ping and perform poorly on less    than the highest-octane gasoline.		</p>		<p>If you'll be operating your    truck in a milder climate, you might even consider converting    it to butane. I've heard that, this fuel doesn't perform well    in colder regions but it's a beautiful way to power all your    machinery in more temperate areas. . . clean, safe,    economical, efficient and easy to store.		</p>		<p>And how about the    transmission for that pickup? Automa or standard? Four-speed    or three? Which is best? Most durable? Well, I don't know    <em>exactly</em> . . . but here are some of the pros and    cons.		</p>		<p>Three-speed, standard shift transmissions are tough,    simple, and easy to work on . . . but they don't have that    compound bottom gear which gives SO much torque and which is    so handy out back of beyond. Then again, there's no    synchramesh on the four-speed's bottom gear, which means that    yon have to be standing still to shift into compound low . .    . and frequently you aren't when you want to shift the most.    T` four-speed is more complicated to work on, too. Still,    that bottom gear is nice to have.		</p>		<p>Folks who like them,    consider modern automatic transmissions to be probably the    most misunderstood pieces of machinery in history. Contrary    to popular belief, they say. today's automatic    transmission-although probably not quite a rugged as a    standard-is certainly rugged. Furthermore, an automatic    delivers power to the rear wheels more smoothly thaws    standard, giving an automatic-equipped truck better traction    in mud and snow. Most of today's drivers find an automatic    transmission easier to handle, too, and-given    reasonable care-it should last at least 100,000 miles.		</p>        <p>          </p>            <p>      Unfortunately, there's just one catch: you're never going      to be able to fix an automatic transmission yourself unless      you know exactly what you're doing and you have the special      tools necessary for the job. Chances are, you don't . . .      and hiring the work done is expensive. If you're lucky,      you'll never face the problem. Then again . . .		</p>		<p>Happily,      selecting a rear end for your truck is easier . . . partly      because you have fewer choices. If you buy a 3/4-ton,      you'll automatically get a significantly larger and      heavier-duty rear end than is available for 1/2-ton      pickups. A two-speed rear end is offered on both sizes by      some manufacturers and-if you find one-consider      yourself fortunate. They're usually pretty good. I consider      posi-traction (limited slip) rear ends almost a must in      rugged terrain.		</p>		<p>If you get a chance to pick up a four-wheel      drive vehicle and it's in good condition, I'd say do it!      It'll have almost unlimited use on your farm, especially if      you make sure the machine has quickdisengage hubs (such as      Warn) up front which will allow those wheels to roll freely      when you want. Driving on the road with all four wheels      powered can give you a superior form of headache and      additional mechanical problems later.		</p>		<p>Most truck      manufacturers offer a power take-off option front, rear and      sometimes even amidship on at least their 3/4-ton pickups.      PTO is not at all necessary when you're using a pickup only      for hauling but it's a handy thing to have for running      winches, loaders, snow blowers and other accessories that      folks sometimes put on personal trucks.		</p>		<p>Now that we have an      idea of what to look for and avoid on pickup trucks in      general, let's give a little more thought to buying a used      vehicle.		</p>		<p>First off, it's good to remember that the fellow      selling a particular second or third-hand machine probably      used the vehicle for the same purpose you have in mind:      hard work. Even if the truck has really been put through      its paces, however, that doesn't mean it's worthless. A      severely used pickup can be a good buy if it's been well      taken care of. If you're interested in a used pickup, it's      up to you to check it out carefully and try to second guess      the man who owns the vehicle. He has a reason for selling .      . . if you can find out what it is, you may have some idea      of the worth of the truck.		</p>		<p>When trying to determine the      condition of a particular pickup, you      should-again-look at the engine. Pay attention      to the finer details. Is everything clean? Do you see oil      splattered or dripping anywhere? Is there oil splashed up      on the underside of the hood?		</p>		<p>If the pickup isn't clean,      drive it to a 25 cents car wash and get as much of the      grease and oil off the vehicle as you can. Then run it for      a while, inspect at the engine and engine compartment again      . . . and you should be able to tell whether the powerplant      has any serious oil or water leaks. Look at the oil while      the engine is hot. It's probably new (changed just for the      occasion by the man trying to sell the truck) but you're      not going to be fooled that easily.		</p>		<p>Pull the dipstick and      inspect the oil very carefully. Are there spots of sludge      in it? If there are, it suggests that the previous owner      didn't change the oil often enough and that there are      probably sludge deposits in both the lubrication lines and      the crankcase. When you find evidence like this, it's a      good idea to pull the rocker arm cover-if you      can-and have a look underneath. I've seen engines      with sludge buildups so bad that the rocker arms and      lifters weren't getting any oil at all. (Excessive tappet      noise is also sometimes an indication of this problem).		</p>		<p>If there are any strange noises coming from the engine      compartment while the truck is running, try to find out      exactly what those noises are. Rev the engine, lug it . . .      and listen carefully. If you have a vacuum gauge, use it.      It can tell you a lot.		</p>		<p>Now shut the engine off and look at      the oil again. Do you see evidence of water bubbles? If you      do, it could mean several things . . . probably a cracked      block.		</p>		<p>Never buy a truck until you've run a compression      check on it. If you don't have a compression gauge, buy one      for two or three dollars before you go shopping. It could      save you hundreds.		</p>		<p>Does the engine you're looking at give      the impression o having been steadily maintained over a      long period of time . . or has it been "slicked"? Check the      installation dates on rebuilt parts. If they're all recent,      it could mean that the owner has been trying to cure a      problem, can't do it and is trying to dump the headache on      you.		</p>		<p>      Check out the interior of the truck. You're going to have      to spend a lot of time there, and you'll want to be      comfortable. Are things inside in good shape? Too good? If      everything looks new, it may be another sign that the truck      has been slicked. Feel the springs under the driver's seat.      Are they sagging? That's one sure sign of hard use, no      matter what the upholstery looks like.		</p>		<p>While you're inside,      check out the mileage. Are the figures all in a straight      row or are some out of line? The latter often indicates      that the mileage has been set back, probably for your      benefit. Can the car pass safety inspection? Honk the horn,      test the head lights, tail lights, turn signals and brake      lights.		</p>		<p>Outside, you'll want to check the body over      carefully. Does the hood open and close easily? Try it      several times. Also, try the tailgate. Some are so badly      battered that they won't latch unless you hammer them shut.		</p>		<p>      Has the truck been wrecked? Sure signs are uneven distances      between doors and body or hood and body . . . and distorted      reflections of light off the paint. If the light reveals      ripples, creases or cracks, you'll probably want to check      more closely. Unless you're particularly worried about      looks, though, the only thing you really want to make      certain of is that the body isn't stuck together with bondo      or fiber glass, both of which tend to crack badly when the      truck is driven over dirt roads or plowed fields for long      periods of time. Also, trucks patched with these materials      may leak water, which is a nuisance.		</p>		<p>Another thing you want      to look for is body rot. Tap around a little with a      screwdriver handle on the fenders, behind the wheels, under      the running boards and in the bed (particularly toward the      front). That area doesn't drain well and water tends to      stand there if the bed is metal.		</p>		<p>If the box isn't metal,      you'll want to check the wood for splintering, breaks or      rot. All three will probably be present to some degree, so      take the degree into consideration when you're deciding      about whether and how much.		</p>		<p>Now, check out the tires. Are      they good, solid truck tires or are they thin automobile      donuts? Is there plenty of tread left on all of them?      Examine each carefully-inside and out-for      blisters, bruises, cuts or peeling.		</p>		<p>Is the transmission a      standard shift? If it is, work the gears. Does it shift      easily? Does it grind when you shift? Does it stay in gear?      Try it on the street in each gear for a distance. Remember,      though, that trucks are often harder to shift than cars, so      don't make a snap judgment. The problem may be in your      shifting, not in the truck.		</p>		<p>If the transmission is an      automatic, notice whether it takes a while for the truck to      start moving after you begin to accelerate. If so, the      transmission may be slipping, so check it out thoroughly      before buying the pickup. Another way to test an automatic      is to listen to it carefully while you're driving. Does it      wait until the engine is highly revved before it shifts?      Does it shift roughly? These can be signs of trouble.		</p>		<p>      Listen, too, for a howling rear end, and avoid the truck      that has one.		</p>		<p>Try the brakes. If they seem good, pull a      front brake drum (it's simple if you leave the tire on, and      it's well worth your time). Are the drums scored? Badly?      Have they been turned down as much as they can be? How are      the shoes? Are they worn evenly, or have they been eaten      away by the drums?		</p>		<p>If the truck has four wheel drive, can      the front wheels be disengaged? Do they make suspicious      sounds when they are engaged?		</p>		<p>Crawl under the vehicle and      look at the springs. Are they leaf or coil? Are they      beginning to sag? Spring-loaded shock absorbers are usually      a sign that the springs were breaking down and the owner      was trying to compensate.		</p>		<p>It's a good idea to check coil      springs closely on a used truck. When they begin to sag,      it's possible-and useless-to brace them up by      inserting a support between the coils. The problem is that      under rough treatment, springs with these things in them      often snap. Spring supporters are good for selling a truck      to someone who doesn't know about them . . . and little      else.		</p>		<p>To determine if the truck you're considering has      front end troubles, first look at the tires. If they're      worn on the sides, or on one side or the other, you might      have an alignment problem.		</p>		<p>Squat down facing a tire and      grip the top with both hands. Push, then pull. Do you feel      any play? If you do, the truck may have a bad king-pin.      Now, grip one side of the tire with each hand. Pull with      your right, and push with your left . . . then push with      your right, and pull with your left. Play? Remember it when      you are making up your mind about the truck. A front-end      job might run you a fair sum, even if you did it yourself.		</p>		<p>      If you've been a careful shopper, the pickup that you      finally drive home ought to be a pretty sound one. To keep      it that way, you'll want to be as particular about      maintaining it as you were about buying.		</p>		<p>Change the oil      faithfully every 4,000 miles. Proper engine lubrication is      an absolute must, and clean oil will help keep down sludge      deposits. If you've bought an older truck, your engine      already has a certain amount of wear on it and one way to      minimize any additional wear and tear is to keep the engine      well lubricated. Use a heavier weight oil during hot      weather and a high-grade, highdetergent oil at all times.		</p>		<p>      When you change the oil in your truck you should also do a      grease job on the front end. This will add to the life of      the vehicle's king-pins and ball-joints and make the pickup      easier to handle. In the long run, it will also save wear      on your tires by maintaining the whole front end in good      shape.		</p>		<p>It's important to keep up to date with minor repairs      on your vehicle. If you need new spark-plugs or distributor      points, replace them before they put too big a load on some      other part and cause major problems. If you're      conscientious about repairs, the per-item expense will be      minimal and you'll save money in the long run.		</p>		<p>In order to      keep your pickup in shape, you're going to need certain      tools. The number and type will depend on the extent of the      work you plan to do, but a good basic set for around $50.00      should let you keep up with standard maintenance.		</p>		<p>Don't go      out and buy fifty dollars worth of just any old thing,      though. You'll need most, if not all, of the following      specific tools:</p><p> 1 good grease gun with flexible hose and a      nozzle small enough to reach the universal joints<br />      1 hack saw<br />      1 cold chisel<br />      1 ball-peen hammer<br />      1 complete set of screw drivers<br />      1 rachet<br />      1 good breaker bar<br />      1 set of combination wrenches<br />      1 set of open-end wrenches<br />      1 set of lug wrenches<br />      1 bumper jack<br />      1 hydraulic jack		</p>		<p>      Economize on most any of these tools-any good brand      will do-except the socket set. You'll probably need      sockets ranging from 3/8" to 1" in a 3/8" drive set and      it's OK to purchase these in the lower cost, uncoated      variety . . . but don't buy a cheap brand.		</p>		<p>On most other      tools there's little difference between brands unless      you're a pro mechanic. Not so with sockets.		</p>		<p>The sockets      made by the Snap-on Tool Company cost a couple of dollars      more, but they do things that no other socket can. A      special shank drive allows each socket to grip the sides of      a nut or bolt head rather than the corners and many worn      bolts and nuts with rounded edges can only be removed with      Snap-on sockets. Don't worry about replacing them . . .      Snap-on offers a life time guarantee.		</p>		<p>If you're planning on      being along way from civilization or if you simply like to      be prepared, there's a number of spare parts you may want      to carry with you. The following equipment should see you      through most any small job you'll have to do.    </p>    <p>      1 complete set of water hoses<br />      1 complete set of fuel lines<br />      2 fan belts<br />      1 water pump<br />      1 fuel pump<br />      1 overhaul gasket set<br />      1 thermostat<br />      1 ignition set (Points, plugs, plug-wires, rotor      distributor cap, fuses and electrician tape).<br />      1 coil<br />      1 oil filter<br />      1 air filter<br />      1 tubeless tire repair kit<br />      1 tire pump (One is available which screws into a spark      plug hole. It's a good buy).    </p>    <p>      Obviously, if you're going to carry these tools and this      spare equipment, you're going to need a good tool box or      topper shell . . . I prefer the tool box because it tends      to keep the volume down and doesn't restrict hauling      capacity.</p><p> In spite of all you may have heard to the      contrary, the MOTOR'S TRUCK & DIESEL REPAIR MANUAL is      available to us non-pro mechanics, too. You can get yours      most easily from the J.C. Whitney Go. in Chicago, from      Sears and-now-from MOTHER. It retails for under      $15.00 and will prove to be a great help to you in times of      trouble I highly recommend it.</p><p> One last suggestion. If      you're going to be operating your truck in cold climates,      forget about the standard automotive 12-volt battery. Buy      two 6-volt, 180 amp golf cart batteries and rig them up in      series. They'll carry your truck all the way to the equator      on the starter motor, if need be.    </p>
