                <p>      <em><strong>A blend of superinsulation and earth sheltering      is a promising option for      owner-builders.<br /></strong></em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Angus W. Macdonald    </h5>        <p>      I've been designing and building "underground" homes for      over seven years now, and the energy efficiency of these      buildings has often surpassed my wildest expectations.      Nonetheless, my experience with earthsheltered structures      has led me to look for ways to simplify construction for      ownerbuilders and to reduce costs wherever possible. The      result, my latest thinking on energysaving design, is a      hybridization of earth tempering, superinsulation, and      solar direct gain.    </p>    <p>      Now, I'm no less convinced than I ever was that earth      contact is an excellent way to reduce heating and cooling      loads. In my area of Virginia, temperatures eight feet      below grade vary from 49°F in April to 64°F in      October-a much more friendly environment than ambient      air temperature, which typically goes as low as 0°F and      as high as 100°F. What's more, earth sheltering      practically eliminates convective wall losses from wind and      thoroughly controls infiltration. Depending on a house's      design, the earth surrounding it may also serve as a heat      storage medium through the seasons.    </p>    <p>      There are some valid reasons, though, to question going      completely underground. First, many of my clients aren't      comfortable with the idea of underground living. They      prefer the profile of a more conventional building and like      the airy feeling of being above grade. Also, covering a      roof with earth requires that the structure be capable of      withstanding a load of 250 pounds per square foot and have      a carefully installed, quality waterproofing system. The      waterproofing alone may add $1.50 per square foot to the      cost of the roof, and waterproofing on a horizontal roof      seems to be more prone to problems than that on the walls.      True, a covering of earth does reduce convective heat loss      and limit infiltration. But even a two-foot-deep layer of      soil will fluctuate from 40°F in February to 73°F      in August, so heavy insulation is still required.    </p>        <p>      But what if, instead of building with a single story      entirely below ground, we were to use two levels, with the      lower one bermed on at least three sides? The below-grade      walls must still be built to withstand a load of 350 pounds      per square foot, and they must be waterproofed and properly      drained. But this cost can be justified, since the walls      serve several purposes. Masonry, which is highly      conductive, provides an intimate thermal link with the      earth. Thus we have mild temperatures outside the walls and      plenty of thermal mass for solar storage. As long as the      cool temperatures of the walls don't combine with high      summer humidity to produce condensation, there's little      need for insulation at depths greater than four feet.    </p>    <p>      Above grade, as dictated by the site topography, we use      wooden framing-I'm fond of heavy-timber construction      for both aesthetic and economic reasons-to erect a      superinsulated cap. Because the south side of both the      first and second floors is unbermed, there's a large      potential area for solar gain, and the apertures can be      sized to suit the mass in each area.    </p>    <p>      A little more than two years ago, I amalgamated these      concepts into a design I call the Solar Carriage House, and      in the last two years two homes have been built using      modified versions of this plan. Though the implementation      is somewhat different in the two buildings, the basic ideas      remain the same.    </p>    <h3>      WALLIS CARRIAGE HOUSE    </h3>        <p>      Jean and David Wallis's version of the Solar Carriage House      is actually just one of the structures these owner-builders      plan to erect on the steep, rocky hillside overlooking      their private stream and valley in central Virginia. Jean      and David, with help from relatives and friends,      constructed the 1,456-square-foot building for use as a      temporary residence while they build a larger hybrid      earthtempered home about 100 feet away. They intend to use      the smaller home as a guest house once the main residence      is done, but the little structure has proven so comfortable      that they now feel no urgency to move.    </p>    <p>      David and Jean worked closely with mason Adrian Stillson to      erect the lower floor of cast concrete and block on a 26' X      28' foundation. This area incorporates a large workshop,      two root cellars/cold storage rooms with heavily insulated      doors of David's design, and a woodstove. The intervening      floor is reinforced cast concrete on Epicore decking. This      masonry floor provides a fireproof barrier between the      workshop and living area, and offers thermal mass for the      sun porch and direct gain living area.    </p>    <p>      The above-grade heavy-timber structure was prepared and      assembled by George Allman's company, Timber Smith Kits of      Gordonsville, Virginia, and David and his two sons, Allan      and Paul, framed and superinsulated the walls and roof.      Many other local craftsmen contributed to the completion of      the Wallises' home, which at times resembled a community      project.    </p>    <p>      During the winter of 1984-85, the perform ance of the      Wallis Carriage House was excel lent. Backup heat from the      woodstove was rarely needed, even when the temperature      plunged to -10°F, and the living area temperatures      ranged from 64°F to 78°F. Jean and David regulate      the interior temperature by operating the sliding glass      doors that connect the solar porch and living area, and      natural convection has been sufficient to provide all the      circulation needed.    </p>    <h3>      MERKEL CARRIAGE HOUSE    </h3>        <p>      Richard and Deborah Merkel chose 30-foot-square version of      the Solar Carriage House plan, with an earth-bermed ground      floor for an office and two stories above Richard erected      the masonry-shell first floor and roofed it with a timber      deck . . . then George Allman's crew assembled the      two-story timber frame on top. Richard worked with Chip      Bond, a contractor in the Rapidan, Virginia, area, to      complete the shingled roof and apply Homesmith Kit R-25      panels and siding to the outside of the post-and-beam      frame. The superinsulated panels-which consist of      one-by wood frames with expanded polystyrene insulation      applied insidewere nailed through their structural rims to      the heavy timbers with pole nails.    </p>    <p>      A major advantage of the timber-kit-andinsulating-panel      approach is that the shell of a home can be assembled very      quickly. Richard completed the masonry in a week, the      timber frame went up in four days, the roof took another      week, and the insulated panels took three men only two days      to apply. All this was done without scafolding. For an      owner-builder who's as pressed for time as for money, this      approach allows a home to be "dried in" in an amazing      hurry.    </p>        <p>      The Merkels' main floor is one open living space, with the      exception of a bath and laundry on the north side. They'll      reach the uppermost floor-which includes the master      bedroom, a study, a walk-in closet, and a large      bathroom-by a prefabricated Piedmont Products pine      spiral stair. All told, the finished area of the house will      be 1,400 square feet, with an additional 900 square feet on      the ground floor.    </p>    <p>      Richard and Deborah's house is tucked into a grove of pine      trees on a south-facing slope overlooking a rural valley.      Deciduous trees offer summer shading for the large glass      area on the south side but won't significantly impede      winter solar gain. To protect the interior from major      nighttime heat loss through the windows, the owners plan to      use Window Quilts by Appropriate Technology Corpora tion.      Backup heat will be from a woodstove on the ground floor.    </p>    <h3>      THE FUTURE    </h3>        <p>      I'm particularly excited about the potential of timber kits      and superinsulated panels for owner-builders-because      of the speed and ease of assembly. This approach is rapidly      growing in popularity, and superinsulated panels are widely      distributed by Homesmith Kits, Homasote Corporation (which      has a polyurethane panel, with a higher R-value per inch,      called TUPS), and Radva Corporation of Radford, Virginia.      The time has already arrived when you can order panels      sized to fit your frame from a nationwide      manufacturerdistributor. But perhaps the most exciting      development for owner-builders on a budget is the emergence      of local producers. Before long, you may be able to buy      panels from a company only a few miles away; better yet,      methods may evolve that will allow you to make them      yourself at your building site!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The Solar Carriage House is one of several      hybrid designs that are featured in Angus Macdonald's new      collection of standard plans for low-cost, passive solar,      earth-tempered, and superinsulated homes.
