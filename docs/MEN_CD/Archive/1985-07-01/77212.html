        <p><strong>WHY</strong> <strong>ARE FEDERAL ENERGY TAX CREDITS SCHEDULED TO BE ELIMINATAD AT YEAR'S END? YEAR'S</strong> That's all especially vexing question in light of a study released recently by the Department of Energy's Office of Renewable Energy. The analysis shows that about $6 billion in federal funds and tax incentives was invested in renewable energy between 1975 and 1984 . . . and that, during the same ten-year period, renewable systems produced the equivalent of $39 billion worth of oil. The study sums up by stating that expenditures "by federal government programs have yielded significantly leveraged investment returns." Yet as we go to press, federal energy tax incentives are slated to cease after December 31, 1985.</p><p><strong>A FAMILY-RUN WIND POWER MUSEUM IS NOW OPEN TO VISITORS</strong> on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Peter and Gerry Tailer include their own solar-heated, wind-powered home among the displays of wind technology from the past and present. The entire ceiling of the Tailer home can be raised to admit sunlight to heat a series of water tanks, and photovoltaic cells provide power for television, radio, and electric fencing. The museum's collection of wind machines includes an easy-to-build, garden-irrigating Greek jib-sail windmill . . . as well as models that pump water, compress air, and generate electricity. Admission is $4.00 for adults and $2.00 for children. Summer hours are 10:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. every day except Wednesday. Phone 617/693-3658 for further information.</p><p><strong>NORWAY MAY SOON BE TUNNELING UNDER THE OCEAN IN SEARCH OF OIL</strong> if a feasibility study being coilducted by Statoil, the country's national oil company, proves positive. The research will determine the safety and economic practicality of drilling a 100-kilometer-long tunnel connecting the shore to huge excavated undersea caverns, where conventional production equipment could be installed.</p><p><strong>THE FIRST HARVEST FROM A EUCALYPTUS TREE FUEL FARM</strong> on the island of Hawaii yielded 25-1/2 green tons per acre from a three-year-old crop. Eucalyptus, which produces 8,600 Btu per pound, grows 1-1/2 feet each month and is considered a prime prospect for biomass cultivation in subtropical regions. The fuel farmers are experimenting with three-, six-, and nine-year-old crops on a variety of land types and hope eventually to produce trees that will be competitive with-or even replace-the imported oil now burned to power sugar cane mills on the island.</p><p><strong>IN FACT, THE ALOHA STATE MAY BE GENERATING 75% OF ALL ITS ELECTRICITY WITH RENEWABLE RESOURCES</strong> within 15 years, according to a report by the utility companies that serve Hawaii's three most populated islands. Geothermal energy is viewed as the most promising resource; half the power for the island of Oahu (where 80% of the state's population lives) could come from such plants. A 2.6-megawatt geothermal facility on the Big Island has been operating efficiently since 1982, and site exploration for high-temperature steam sources is underway on Maui. The wind, ocean thermal conversion, municipal waste, and biomass were the other promising major sources of energy analyzed in the study.</p><p><strong>CORN IS BEING USED NOT ONLY TO PRODUCE ETHANOL BUT TO FILTER WATER</strong> <strong>OUT OF THE FUEL</strong> at ADM Foods' Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ethanol production facility. Although 92% of the water in raw corn alcohol can be removed by distillation, the remaining 8% is ordinarily extracted by way of a complicated and expensive process using the toxic solvent benzene. ADM, however, has put what it calls "corn grits technology" to work instead: The company's raw ethanol is reduced to vapor and forced through a column of finely ground cornmeal, which absorbs the water. The fuel is then condensed back to a liquid, and the water-soaked grits are dried with hot air or carbon dioxide for reuse. If, after several recyclings, the meal loses its absorptive capacity, it can simply be converted to ethanol, too. The savings to ADM, Inc. is about 4e per gallon, which-when the system is installed in all four of the company's plants-will total about $15 million a year.</p><p><strong>SOLAR USAGE NOW, INC.'S SECOND ANNUAL SOLAR EQUIPMENT AUCTION WILL BE HELD THIS YEAR</strong> ON JULY 6 in Bascom, Ohio. The event, which will be preceded by a series of free solar workshops on July 5, will feature a wide variety of solar equipment up for sale. Participants in last year's auction ranged from novice do-it-yourselfers to solar contractors, and they bid on everything from woodstoves and liquid collectors to photovoltaic panels and complex control apparatuses. For further information, contact Joseph Deahl, SUN, Inc., P.O. Box 306, Bascom, OH 44809, 800/537-0985 (in Ohio, call 419/937-2226).</p><p><strong>AMERICAN-MADE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS WILL BRIGHTEN SAUDI ARABIAN HIGHWAYS</strong>, where eight PV-based systems will be installed this year to provide power for lights and signs in remote desert tunnels .... Here in this country, <strong>SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD IS USING PV PANELS</strong> to produce the juice for out-of-the-way track signals and switches .... <strong>U.S. NAVY RADAR IS RUNNING ON WIND AND SOLAR CELL POWER</strong> at a training station for pilots on Bodie Island, North Carolina.</p>
