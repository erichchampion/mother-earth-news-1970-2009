                    <h3>      Condor Shell Game    </h3>        <p>      The government officials who are charged with protecting      endangered species hatched another bad idea in April. The      California Condor Recovery Team-a long arm of the      U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department      of Fish and Game, and the National Audubon Society-is      considering a plan to capture <em>all</em> the remaining      wild condors, place them in the Los Angeles and San Diego      zoos, and restock the wild with Andean condors, which are      distant cousins found in South America. Proponents of the      plan describe condor internment as "protective custody."    </p>    <p>      "It's a great ploy for zoos but a disaster for the wild      condor," said David Phillips, FOE's wildlife projects      director. "The program has been botched from the start, but      this is the worst yet. For the past three years, every      condor egg and nestling produced in the wild has been sent      of to a zoo, and every bird they could get their hands on      has been captured. Not one pair has been allowed to breed      and raise young free from molestation."    </p>    <p>      True to form, the "CTeam" snatched the only remaining wild      condor egg from its nest near Santa Barbara on April 23 and      spirited it away to the San Diego zoo. Officials state that      they took the egg to protect it from nearby ravens. (The      parents of the egg, thought to be the sole pair of mating      condors in the wild, weren't consulted.) Phillips, who has      long been critical of the program to remove wild condors      for captive breeding, believes that the C-Team's      "intervention is causing the breakup of mating pairs."    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to protest the plan to remove all remaining      condors from the wild, write to Donald Hodel, Secretary of      the Interior, Washington, DC 20240, and the California Fish      and Game Commission, 1416 9th St., Sacramento, CA      95814.</p>      <h3>Endangered Species Act Endangered    </h3>    <p>      Condors need protection . . . therefore, they need the      Endangered Species Act (ESA), the authorization and funding      for which expire on September 30. The $27 million currently      allocated to the ESA isn't nearly enough to list and      protect all the endangered species, which are being driven      to extinction at a worldwide rate of one to three per day.      The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has identified 1,019      species that should be added to the list, but at the      current rate-39 species per year have been added      since 1973-that would take more than 25 years.    </p>    <p>      Urge your representatives to reauthorize the act and fund      it at a higher level. And to get more information on this      issue, along with a copy of the Endangered Species      Reauthorization Bulletin, write to David Phillips, FOE,      1045 Sansome St., San Francisco, CA 94111.    </p>        <p>      A new study has found that precipitation in western states      is becoming more acidic. Researchers for the World      Resources Institute and the Energy and Resources Group of      the University of California, Berkeley, found that acid      rain is falling on Yosemite, Sequoia, Mount Ranier, North      Cascades, and Rocky Mountain national parks.    </p>    <p>      Sulfur emissions from copper, zinc, and lead      smelting-rather than those from coalburning power      plants, which are thought to cause most of the problem in      the East-now account for almost half of western acid      precipitation. Existing smelters are scheduled to reduce      emissions 30% by 1988, but other new sources may overwhelm      this gain. For example, a copper smelter under construction      in Nacozari, Mexico (60 miles south of the U.S border),      will emit more than 500,000 tons of sulfur dioxide each      year, becoming the second largest source of the pollutant      in North America.    </p>    <p>      The effects of acid precipitation on lakes, wildlife, and      trees have been widely reported, but much less has been      presented on the damage to humans. Now a report in the      December 21, 1984, issue of Science suggests that acid rain      may contribute to brain disorders such as Alzheimer's      disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, and      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease).      Unusually high levels of aluminum have been found in the      brain lesions common to victims of these disorders, and      recent studies in Japan and Germany suggest that aluminum      may play a causative role.    </p>    <p>      Here's how acid precipitation fits in: It seems that      aluminum, which constitutes about 5% of the earth's crust,      doesn't dissolve in neutral or basic water but passes      readily into solution when the pH drops to significantly      acidic levels. Acid rain, fog, sleet, and snow can dissolve      aluminum in soil, lake bottom sediments, pipes, and the      soldering materials used to join pipes. (Lead, cadmium, and      mercury also dissolve more readily in acidic water.) Low-pH      drinking water, then, can contain significant      concentrations of aluminum (and of other toxic heavy metals      that are known to be harmful).    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The activities of the worldwide      organization called Friends of the Earth-along with a      broad range of other news concerning environmental      developments-are described each month in its      publication titled Not Man Apart.
