                    <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrliehs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us, for      instance, have read Paul's book The Population Bomb), few      people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (the type that tends to be      published only in technical journals and college texts).      That's why we're pleased to present this regular      semitechnical column by these well-known      authorsecologists-educators.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne and Paul Ehrlich    </h5>    <p>      In the last three columns, we've seen how resources are      partitioned among the wild herbivores of the Serengeti      ecosystem. Kenyan wildlife biologist David Hopcraft, along      with his wife, Carole, has used such knowledge to launch a      successful "game ranch."    </p>    <p>      Though cattle are viewed as a source of wealth by many      African peoples, such as the Masai, the animals      are-from an <em>ecological</em> point of      view-actually a source of poverty in hot, semiarid      climates. Cattle (and goats and sheep) must walk daily to a      water supply to drink. This passage consumes a good deal of      energy and slows the rate at which the animals gain weight.      It also results in the trampling of valuable grasses and      compacting of the soil surface.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, wild herbivores have much less need to      drink. Some, such as eland, oryx, and Grant's gazelles, may      even obtain all the water they require from the vegetation      they eat. Others drink some water but still need much less      than do cattle. This is because most native African      herbivores conserve water much more efficiently in      digestion. For example, nearly all of the moisture is      extracted from the intestinal contents of gazelles, and dry      feces are released.    </p>    <p>      Cowpats, in contrast, are produced moist, and rapidly lose      ammonia (and thus the vital nutrient nitrogen) to the      atmosphere. They then dry in the sun and heat up, killing      the bacteria and fungi that might speed their      decomposition. The flat, dried cowpat even kills the grass      beneath it!<br />      The dry fecal pellets of antelope, however, are roughly      spherical. They fall between the grass blades, do not heat      up, and retain their nitrogen. Rather than tending to      create a "fecal pavement," as cattle droppings do, they      break down readily and return nutrients to the soil.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, like most grazers, cattle have quite specific      food preferences-they graze some grass species heavily and      others not at all. In cattle-raising areas, the species      composition of the forage changes, with those grass species      not eaten by cattle becoming increasingly common. But, as      we described in our first column on the Serengeti ecosystem      (MOTHER N0. 91), the native herbivores partition the      available plant species, their diets complementing each      other to one degree or another.<br />      Thus, not only are the waterconserving native herbivores      better adapted to the semiarid habitat of the African      savanna, but they don't degrade it physically or      chemically. Cattle, however, parading back and forth to      water holes and producing their destructive droppings, have      been a major engine of desertification on the continent.    </p>    <p>      All of these differences led David Hopcraft to conclude      that the soundest way to exploit African grasslands is not      to graze cattle on them, but to organize ranches to raise      and harvest native herbivores. On their 20,000-acre ranch      on the Athi Kapiti plains near Nairobi, the Hopcrafts have      been putting that theory into practice since 1978.    </p>    <h3>      Exotic Livestock    </h3>    <p>      The ranch is stocked with a variety of grazers and      browsers, including antelope, zebras, giraffes, and      ostriches. Cattle are being phased out and may one day be      replaced by African buffalo. For the present, however, the      cattle serve as a valuable "control" for comparing costs      and meat yields with those of the native animals.    </p>    <p>      A great deal of research is being carried out at the ranch.      The dynamics of the various populations are carefully      tracked, and the food preferences of the different animals      are recorded. When we visited the Hopcrafts in early 1984,      two veterinarians were at the ranch studying the parasites      of harvested animals.<br />      So far, the results of the experiment are exceeding the      Hopcrafts' early hopes and expectations. The herds of      native herbivores-and the meat yields from      them-have been steadily increasing. Simultaneously,      the condition of the range has been improving-even      though the combined weight (biomass) of cattle and native      herbivores has increased by some 35% in the past few      years.<br />      Harvesting is efficient and more humane than in a typical      slaughterhouse. One night each week, men in Land-Rovers      spotlight surplus male animals and dispatch each one      instantly with a high-velocity bullet to the brain. The      other animals are not distressed. Then each carcass is      rapidly processed under the scrutiny of the government      inspector.    </p>    <p>      The Hopcrafts are also experimenting with various ways of      marketing the meat, which they describe collectively as      "African venison." Having eaten steaks from many African      herbivores, we can testify that when the animals are      properly slaughtered and the meat carefully prepared, such      food is delicious. We tried several new dried "jerky"      products at the ranch and quickly became addicted to them.      The venison is also being smoked and converted into      sausages and salamis.    </p>    <h3>      Multiple Advantages    </h3>    <p>      It seems to us that the Hopcrafts have established the      basic economic feasibility of African game ranching. Costs      are substantially lower than those of cattle raising in      that region. Much less water has to be supplied to the      animals, meaning less capital must be sunk into bores,      dams, and piping. And, unlike cattle, game animals require      no dipping or inoculation against parasites and      diseases.<br />      Moreover, there is no need for herding or      corralling-the native herbivores handle their own      predator protection. Indeed, the Hopcrafts' herds have been      expanding in spite of almost no predator control. Lions,      cheetahs, hyenas, and jackals all inhabit the ranch, but      they harvest only a small share of the game.    </p>    <p>      The exact economic advantages of a game ranch over a cattle      ranch have not yet been determined. From the data the      Hopcrafts have gathered so far, it appears that the yield      of lean meat from an operation such as the game ranch will      be at least twice the poundage per acre taken from the best      cattle ranch in the region.    </p>    <p>      In addition to rapid growth rates in the game species, a      major reason for this higher productivity is that a variety      of herbivores partitioning resources can utilize much more      of the vegetation than cattle can.    </p>    <p>      An additional advantage of the game ranch is in the      potential for selling the hides. Those from the game should      have a much higher value than cowhides, but at the moment      the sale of game hides is prohibited by the Kenyan      government-quite properly, since most of them are obtained      by poaching. It is possible that a licensing system could      be devised to allow game ranchers to market their hides, as      mink ranchers do in the United States.    </p>    <h3>      Breaking Traditions    </h3>    <p>      There are, of course, some problems still to be overcome.      The main difficulties involve breaking      traditions-traditions of what meat is good to eat,      traditions among scientists in animal husbandry for whom      the idea of game ranching is too novel, traditions among      African pastoral peoples such as the Masai, to whom cattle      are the main symbol of wealth.    </p>    <p>      In Africa, however, the benefits of breaking with these      traditions would be enormous. In the face of extremely      rapid human population growth, African game animals are      fast disappearing; even national parks are under intense      pressure from expanding agriculture and poaching. And      hunger is already widespread on the continent, which has      been stricken by disastrous droughts and famines in the      last few years. Food supplies per person in most African      countries south of the Sahara desert declined by about 10%      between 1970 and 1982, as population growth outstripped the      gains in food production. As the current drought has      deepened and spread, food production has plummeted by      another 10%. A major contributing factor to this      continent-wide tragedy has been desertification      caused in significant part by overgrazing of semiarid lands      by traditional domestic animals.    </p>    <p>      Clearly, game ranching could help preserve Africa's unique      large animals and contribute substantially to its food      supply-if it can become established before      desertification is too far advanced even to support the      game animals. We're happy to report that the Kenyan      government is very interested in the Hopcrafts' project,      and that more game ranches may be established in that      nation and elsewhere in Africa in the near future. The      Hopcrafts' ranch has been serving as a training ground for      interested students taking degrees in wildlife management      and animal husbandry. These students will eventually be      able to apply what they've learned to new projects.    </p>    <p>      Indeed, the Hopcrafts are now looking to the establishment      of a game ranch utilizing North American herbivores -deer,      antelope, American bison-in New Mexico, where overgrazing      of cattle has led to considerable desertification . In view      of its potential for being an ecologically benign,      sustainable, and productive system of food production in      any climatic region, we hope that game ranching is an idea      whose time has come.    </p>    <p>      People interested in the New Mexico game-ranching project      can get information by sending a self-addressed, stamped      envelope to US, Inc., 2957 Atkins Rd., Petosky, MI 49770      (616/347-1171).    </p>    <p>      The Ehrlichs' work is supported in part by a grant from the      Koret Foundation of San Francisco.    </p>
