        <p>I have found a way to recycle that also has solved some other problems.</p><p>The problem started because we heat our house with wood, and starting the stove in the morning was a pain and sometimes took longer than I had time for. So I started using our shredded bills instead of newspaper. I only need a handful or two to catch the leftover coals, and the bills take up less room than stacks of newspapers. It also keeps the shredded paper out of the landfills.</p><h5>Susan Hugel<br />Swanzey, New Hampshire</h5><p><em>P.S. For anyone with small critters in the house, shredded bills also make wonderful bedding.</em></p>
