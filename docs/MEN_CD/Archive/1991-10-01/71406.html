To get      the most out of yours, you should remem ber several tips:    </p>    <p>      *An open or missing damper can allow as much heat to escape      as an open door does! Close it whenever the fireplace is      not in use.<br />      *Carefully close the damper down as far it will go while      maintaining sufficient draft. The wood will bum      longer.<br />      *Consider adding a hollow-tube grate. This device pick up      cold air a baseboard level, warms it as it passes through      the firebox, then sends the warmed air back into the room.      Some models even sport an electric blower.<br />      *A great amount of heat is lost after an evening fire, when      the damper must be left open to let out smoke. If you often      bum the midnight wood, try covering the fireplace opening      with a sheet of aluminum to cut off the flow of warm air      escaping up the chimney. Or consider adding glass doors,      which allow you to watch the fire without any heat      loss.<br />      *Clean your chimney at least once a year, mom often if soot      and creosote build up.    </p>    <h3>      Hot-Water Radiators    </h3>    <p>      *First, dust or vacuum your radiator (and repeat frequently      during the season).<br />      *Then, "bleed" any trapped air in your unit. Use the knob      at the top of the radiator or a key (available at hardware      stores) to open the valve. Keep it open until hot water      spurts out. It will be hot and should he caught in a      bucket. Then close it securely. Should any of your      radiators run cooler than normal during the winter, bleed      them and allow the unit to refill completely with      water.<br />      *Never put a box over your radiator. Nothing should block      the flow of heat.<br />      *Build a radiator reflector to keep heat from escaping      through the wall or nearby windows. While these reflectors      (made of thin bubble-pack with an aluminum backing) are      fairly cheap and available from hardware stores, it's easy      to make your own. Cut a piece of cardboard slightly larger      than the wall space behind the radiator. Cover with      aluminum foil; then fasten behind the radiator. Whether you      buy or build your own, take care that the reflector doesn't      touch the unit itself or heat will be reflected into the      walls instead of the room.    </p>    <h3>      Steam Heating System    </h3>    <p>      *Replace any air vents that aren't working. To check, warm      the system up and listen as the air comes out of the vent.      You should hear a click, after which the air will stop      rushing out. Or, unscrew the vent when the radiator is cold      and blow through it. Install a new vent if you can't blow      through it or your radiator doesn't "click" off.<br />      *Dust or vacuum radiators frequently.<br />      *Don't cover radiators or block their air flow.<br />      *Prevent sediment buildup in your boiler. Once or twice a      month drain half a bucketful of water from the low water      cut-off valve (looks almost like a faucet and is usually      mounted near the bottom of the boiler with a piece of hose      attached to it). Once you have drained off the sediment,      open another valve located near the ceiling to let water      flow to the boiler. It is important that you add enough      water to keep the level adequate to fill the boiler jacket,      usually shown in the glass type (sight glass) as As midway      point. Do not add too much water at any one time if the      unit is on; sudden temperature change can crack the boiler.    </p>    <h3>      Warm-Air Heating System    </h3>    <p>      *Replace your air filters and change them again every one      or two months.<br />      *Move furniture and rugs away from registers. That      breathtaking room arrangement can be redone next      spring.<br />      *Check the dampers within the supply ducts coming from the      furnace. Make sure that each is adjusted to provide even      heat throughout the house (more to frequently used or      drafty areas like a front living room, less to well-heated      places like interior secondfloor bedrooms). To do this,      position handles on the side of each duct near the furnace      to the desired heat flow.<br />      *If your system is gas-fired, remember to turn off the      pilot light next summer, using the pilot control knob      (don't blow the light out). If you don't know how, ask your      heating system service company.    </p>
