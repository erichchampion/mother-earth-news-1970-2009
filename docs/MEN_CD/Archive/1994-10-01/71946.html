            			<p>				<strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>			</p>			      <p>			 <strong><em>Nine simple ways to present a less-tempting      target to thieves.</em></strong>    </p>    	    <h3>      Make It Tough on Burglars    </h3>    <p>      The old adage that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound      of cure" couldn't be applied better than in protecting your      home from burglary. Here are nine things you can do now      - for virtually nothing.    </p>    <p>      1. Never leave a note on your door indicating that you are      not home and will be back shortly.    </p>    <p>      2. Measure all your windows and sliding glass doors, and      brace them closed with 2"-wide wooden sticks. A single lock      on a window or door is usually not enough. By the way, if      you must purchase a new lock, slide locks are a good bet on      sliding doors and windows; use key-only, dual-side dead      bolts on other doors.    </p>    <p>      3. Alarm stickers are available from any hardware store.      Place them conspicuously and a burglar will usually not      take the chance.    </p>    <p>      4. If you have an alarm system for your home or plan to get      one, make sure that you put the outside siren box far up      and out of reach. All it takes is a $3 can of spray      insulation aimed inside the alarm box to prevent it from      sounding.    </p>    <p>      5. Get an unlisted phone number. Friends will get your      number when they need it, but annoying solicitors and      thieves will not be able to call at random and ascertain      whether you're home. And don't leave your number on an      answering machine. People you know already have your      number.    </p>    <p>      6. You've heard it before, but have you done it? Engrave      your name and driver's license number on anything you want      to keep. That includes expensive tools in the garage. And      if there's anything at home that makes you particularly      nervous to keep around, fork over a few dollars and get a      safety deposit box. You will positively thank yourself for      the effort later.    </p>    <p>      7. When buying or selling items in the newspaper or      responding to personal ads, leave only a phone number,      never an address. If a buyer or seller wishes to meet you,      suggest that you meet them in a public place first. A pain?      Absolutely, but the safe thing to do.    </p>    <p>      8. Always ask service people for their identification      before allowing them to enter your home.    </p>    <p>      9. Try to use a P.O. box for your car registration.      Mechanics or parking attendants can easily pop open the      glove box and find out a great deal about you. Don't make      it easy.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Renato Carter<br />      Tehachapi, CA</em>    </p>    	    <h3>      Lords of the Rings    </h3>    <p>      My daughters and I discovered a fun yet practical way to      recycle pop tops from aluminum cans. Would you believe      fencing? The ring fence is definitely an undertaking (there      are over 90,000 rings on the fence in front of our      property), but it is certainly a pleasant alternative to      barbed wire. We started small, collected gradually where we      could, and built over time. Oh, by the way, the poles we      used were remnants given to us from a logging site near our      home.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Mike Catalano<br />      Hayneville, AL</em>    </p>    <h3>      No Rubber Duck Required			    </h3>    <p>      Miniblinds are a very popular window treatment and, like      most people, we were clueless as to how to clean them. We      tried vacuuming, dusting, and wiping them clean with      towels. My wife still doesn't want to talk about the time I      took them over to the car wash.    </p>        <p>      Well, here is an easy method that will give these popular      shades new sparkle. Wash them in your bathtub.    </p>    <p>      If you have a shower curtain with a spring-loaded adjuster      (built to accommodate a variety of shower widths), you're      halfway there. If you don't, you can buy an adjustable      shower curtain rod from your local discount store for just      a few dollars. Place the shower curtain rod (minus the      shower curtain) directly over the tub rather than along the      side, and hang the dirty miniblind on the rod using the      round ring holders used to keep the shower curtain in      place. Then just spray the blind with an all-purpose      cleaner and wipe with a sponge. Rinse, and they are like      new again. They drip dry very quickly, but you might want      to place a towel under them after rehanging to avoid water      spots on the floor or window sill.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Kent David<br />      Vilonia, AR</em>    </p>    <h3>      Look Up!    </h3>    <p>      You're invited to attend a showing of divinely inspired      sculpture by universally renowned artists. We are fortunate      to have a local gallery that offers free parking, ample      seating, and standard and reclining viewing areas. Simply      visit an open space from which to view the clouds above.      This work conveys its underlying message simply, yet      eloquently. As with all great art, the feeling is      powerfully portrayed, and since styles vary widely, each      person will have little trouble finding those that have      special, personal appeal.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Rev. Fred E. Haga<br />      Vancouver, WA</em>    </p>        <h3>      Smoother Drilling    </h3>    <p>      When I use my electric drill for shop projects, I extend      the life of the sharpened bit by using lard to lubricate      cutting surfaces. I always keep a can full of hardened pork      fat on my workbench. Then anytime drilling metal is      required, I first dip the end of the bit into the lard. It      works far better than any expensive cutting oil I've ever      used.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Alan Pryor<br />      Palo Alto, CA</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Country Lore is a great way for you to share practical      solutions to life's frustrating problems.
