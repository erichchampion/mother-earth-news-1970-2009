            		<p>				<strong>HOME HEALTH REMEDIES</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By sid Kirchheimer    </h5>					<p>      <strong>Doctors share more of their practical home      remedies.</strong>    </p>        <h3>      TENDINITIS    </h3>    <p>      After spending a few hours hacking away at a pile of      fuelwood, your knees, elbows, and wrists may feel      slightly... overextended. Of course, a little discomfort      should be expected under those circumstances, but soreness      could be attributed to tendinitis as much as to harmless      muscle pain. So how do you tell the difference?    </p>    <p>      Tendinitis is an inflammation of the tendon - the      cord that attaches muscle to bone. "So that is where you      would feel the pain," says Robert E. Leach, M.D., professor      and chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at      Boston University Medical Center and chairman of the U.S.      Olympic Committee on Sports Medicine and Sports Science. A      pulled muscle, on the other hand, occurs in the "belly" of      the muscle and hurts only when you stretch it. Although      avoiding overexercising and overtraining by listening      carefully to your body and ceasing painful activity      immediately is the first step in dealing with painful      muscles and joints, there are many therapeutic steps to      take in the event of an injury.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Put on an ice pack</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Ice decreases inflammation by decreasing blood flow to the      injured area," says Steven F. Habusta, D.O., of Parkwood      Orthopedics in Toledo. "There's no such thing as too much      ice."    </p>    <p>      You can buy an ice pack made of gel, or you can make a pack      by putting ice in a sealed plastic bag. Another alternative      is to use a bag of frozen vegetables. Dr. Habusta suggests      placing a terry cloth towel between your skin and the ice      pack to prevent burns or blisters.    </p>    <p>      Once the swelling of the immediate injury has gone down,      applying heat in the form of pads, liniments, or warm      compresses can help keep the affected tendons from      stiffening as well as ease your pain. Do not use a heating      pad with liniments though, as this may result in an      extremely painful burn.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stretch it</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Careful stretching of the affected muscle and tendon so      that it doesn't get too tight is important in both the      treatment and prevention of tendinitis," says Dr. Leach.      "But don't stretch so much that you cause pain. Pain      usually means that you are tearing tissue." Stretch your      sore muscle each day, using smooth and slow motions. For      that matter, make stretching a daily morning routine for      your entire body and you might well keep muscle and tendon      injuries from happening in the first place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Down an antiinflammatory</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Aspirin and ibuprofen (e.g., Advil) are immediately      available to most people," says Dr. Leach, "and they're      both antiinflammatory. Take either of them (not both) a      couple of times a day." But pay attention to the amount      that you take. "If you notice that you are not getting      better or that you've been increasing the amount, it's      obvious that you should be doing something else," says Dr.      Leach. Also, do not give aspirin to children because of the      risk of Reye's syndrome.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Elevate it</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you can rest the painful limb or joint above heart      level, you'll ease the swelling that often accompanies      tendinitis. If you have tendinitis in your leg, for      instance, rest it on top of a pile of pillows.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sling it</strong>    </p>    <p>      For tendinitis in your shoulder, you can place the affected      arm in a cloth sling as you would a broken arm. The idea is      to keep the arm immobile, so the shoulder doesn't move      around.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pamper yourself with a massage</strong>    </p>    <p>      Not only is massage very soothing, it also helps to relax      the muscles and tendons, so they can be stretched very      easily, says Dr. Leach. Although a massage is not a cure,      it will help you feel more comfortable while the inflamed      tendon is healing.    </p>        <h3>      When to See the Doctor    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Tendonitis</strong>    </p>    <p>      Does the pain get worse every time you pick up an ax? Is it      getting progressively more difficult to open that jar of      mayonnaise?    </p>    <p>      If the pain is getting worse or lasting a longtime, you      should see a doctor, according to James A. Nicholas, M.D.,      director of the Department of Orthopedics at Lenox Hill      Hospital in New York City. Dr. Nicholas notes that      tendinitis can have many origins, some more serious than      others: "It could be caused by injury, by gout, by      rheumatoid arthritis, or by certain metabolic disorders."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broken Bones</strong>    </p>    <p>      The most important thing you should know about broken bones      is that they require immediate medical attention. If you      even suspect a fracture, have a doctor check it out.      Otherwise, you may further damage the broken bone. There's      also risk of infection and delayed healing.    </p>	<h3>			BROKEN BONE		</h3>    <p>      Sir Isaac Newton may well have figured out why apples fall      down and not up, but the rest of us have known the hard      truths about gravity ever since the first person hit the      ground. With 208 bones in the human body, there's      tremendous potential for breakage. If you're on the mend      from such a fracture, there are many ways you can speed      healing and make yourself more comfortable.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Butt out</strong>    </p>    <p>      Smoking can delay the healing of bones - it can take      up to five months longer for serious fractures and less for      minor breaks, says orthopedic surgeon George Cierny III,      M.D., of Atlanta. He has shown experimentally that nicotine      and other substances in cigarette smoke reduce the amount      of oxygen reaching bone tissue, causing the delay in      healing. So if you're a smoker, expect a      longer-than-average healing time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Watch what you drink</strong>    </p>    <p>      It's still unknown what effect alcohol and caffeine have on      healing, but researchers know that people who consume      beverages containing these two substances are more likely      to endure fractures. That's because caffeine and alcohol      affect bone mass and interfere with calcium absorption,      which builds stronger bones.    </p>    <p>      "In our study, there was an increased risk of getting      fractures in those who drank more than four cups of coffee      daily or about two glasses of alcohol - wine, beer,      or a highball," says Graham A. Colditz, M.D., a researcher      at Harvard Medical School in Boston.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RICE is nice</strong>    </p>    <p>      On the first-aid front, most experts suggest some big chill      - even after your doctor has treated you. The acronym      RICE - rest, ice, compression, and elevation -      describes the best way to hasten healing and prevent      further damage. If you have a minor fracture that's      protected by an air cast or soft cast, your doctor might      let you remove the cast now and then to apply ice directly.      "Put a bag of frozen vegetables on the fracture for about      20 minutes, then remove it for 10," suggests Steven      Subotnick, D.P.M., a sports podiatrist in Hayward,      California, and author of <em>Sports and Exercise      Injuries</em> . "But make sure you put a washcloth between      your skin and the ice bag to prevent an ice burn." Since      you want to avoid pressure on the area, the cold compress      should be applied lightly. Even if you can't take off a      soft cast, You can apply ice to the outside of the cast,      and it will help chill the area underneath.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stop itchy casts</strong>    </p>    <p>      Bothered by that annoying itch from inside a cast? There's      a big temptation to simply go for it and itch away to find      relief. That might feel good for a second, but it's no      solution. Scratching with a ruler, clothes hanger, or other      device will just produce more itching from the tiny cuts      caused by your scratching.    </p>    <p>      "Instead, simply elevate the fractured area so that it's      above the level of your heart," suggests Philip Sanfilippo,      D.P.M., a San Francisco podiatrist who specializes in      sports injuries and treatment. "By doing that, you'll      diminish blood flow to the area and reduce swelling. Often      that's enough to relieve the itching."    </p>    <p>      <em>Adapted from</em> The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies II      <em>(Rodale Press, 1993) by Sid Kirchheimer.
