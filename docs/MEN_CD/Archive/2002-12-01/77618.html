        <h3>Readers' tips to live by</h3><p><strong>Simple Privy Vent</strong></p><p>Several years ago, as a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, I experimented with VIPs, Ventilation-Improved Privies. The house we rented in a small village came with an odoriferous, flyinfested outhouse, as did all the houses in the village.</p><p>After moving in, I built a raised platform and installed a toilet seat, converting the privy from a squatter to a sitter. I bought a 6-foot section of thin-wall, 1 1/2-inch plastic pipe and (taking care not to plug the pipe with dirt) poked it through the dirt, from the outside into the pit area, so that it ended just under the platform on which the seat rested. Working from the sunny north side (Paraguay is south of the equator) of the building, I fastened the pipe to the <em>outside</em> wall vertically, being careful not to crimp it. Then, I painted the pipe flat black. As an indicator of air flow, I glued one end of a small piece of audio tape to the pipe outlet.</p><p>The next morning, I was outside the outhouse at sunrise. As the pipe heated, the piece of tape began to flutter, then stood straight up. As I watched, the flies left the pit and swarmed at the pipe outlet. After several days, all odor disappeared along with most of the flies. Later, as a further refinement, I wired a piece of screen over the top end of the pipe.</p><p>This simple ventilation system works for both squatters and sitters as long as a cover for the seat or hole is provided and kept closed when not in use. There should be a small opening of some sort just under the cover, which permits air to enter the pit area, flow up the pipe and sweep away any odors. Other pipe sizes may work just as well, but to promote rapid air flow I believe it pays to keep the pipe rather small.</p><p>I wonder why more outdoor toilets don't take advantage of this simple use of the power of the sun? The outdoor privies at rest stops as well as the Amish outhouses in our area all use 4-inch vent pipes, but located <em>inside</em> the structures. What would cause any air flow in these pipes is beyond me.</p><p>DAVE JOHNSON<br />Coloma, Wisconsin</p><p><strong>Threading Needles</strong></p><p>Getting older isn't always fun. Mending can be a pain. Threading the needle is a time-consuming necessity. And the sewing machine is the worst, or was until I grabbed a 3x5-inch index card and put it behind the needle. Hey, there's the hole!</p><p>LEE SUTTLES<br />Zanesville, Ohio</p><p><strong>Kerosene Chick Incubator</strong></p><p>Since I live in an area with unreliable electrical power, I wanted an alternatively powered incubator to use in case of emergency. I have finally found a reasonably priced, kerosene-fueled unit. Liberty Incubators makes an incubator priced at $820 that will accommodate 150 chicken eggs. Their address is Liberty Incubators; 506 North Sequoia Drive; Horseshoe Bend, AR 72512; (870) 670-5282; <em>www.libertyincubators.com .</em> I hope this will help someone who is looking for a way (besides Mama Hen) to keep themselves supplied with chickens.</p><p>THOMAS LEDBETTER<br />New London, North Carolina</p><p><strong>Feeding Feathered Friends</strong></p><p>Chickadees, tufted titmice, blue jays, cardinals, sparrows, juncos and red-headed woodpeckers all come to feast on the scrumptious mixture of seeds, nuts and cracked corn I put out for them.</p><p>I recommend high quality black-oil sunflower seeds as the basic wild-bird food. Cracked corn millet and thistle also are favorites of our feathered friends. In addition to putting seed in feeders, I also drop several handfuls of seed on the ground for the ground feeders.</p><p>To make special bird treats, gather large pinecones, dip the cones in honey and then shake them in a bag full of cracked corn and white millet. Sometimes I use peanut butter, but honey seems to appeal to the largest number of birds. One of the benefits of creating your own seed treats is that you can avoid commercial mixes that include less attractive filler seed to bulk up the mix.</p><p>To make a simple, homemade jug feeder, use a utility knife to cut a window out of the jug, about 2 inches up from the bottom. Poke several small holes in the bottom so rainwater can drain. Add a small stick just below the window for a perch. Some birds will feed inside the jug while others stand on the perch.</p><p>JULES DUGGAN<br />Eagle Bridge, New York</p><p><strong>Homemade Sawmill</strong></p><p>The inspiration for designing and building my own lumber mill came strictly from a cost standpoint. I had a lot of hard maple cut down and piled up in 8- and 10-foot lengths. To make them into lumber, I either had to haul those logs, some 2 feet thick, to a mill or have a mill come in and do the job. The prices for sawing were quoted starting at $150 per thousand board feet. Purchasing a mill was out of the question, since the price for a hand-operated mill was $4,000 or more. So I started making drawings and designs.</p><p>I had some iron on hand, and a small shop with a welder and some metal-cutting equipment. I knew where I could purchase material (some used) at a reasonable cost, so I started laying out a foundation for the mill and welding it together. Keep in mind, my logs were fairly large, so I laid out the length of the foundation to 16 feet to accommodate the mill head-the pan of the mill that carries the motors, band wheels and cutting blade-and up to a 12-inch-wide log.</p><p>I had a 12-horsepower, electric-start industrial engine on hand. I used 13-inch car wheels and tires to run the band on. I incorporated all of that into the mill head that rolls on tracks. To saw the lumber size I need for a specific project, I push the mill head by hand through the logs. The mill pictured above has sawed everything from old, dry, white-oak beams to old highline poles, and made lumber up to 12 feet long.</p><p>It took me only six weeks to build. The machine works well and does what I designed it to do. Not bad for a do-ityourself project that cast me less than $700 in materials. All the parts I used are readily available; scrounging up parts was not a problem.</p><p>Fully detailed plans and instructions are available by sending $20 to Mencer Johnson; 50178 364th Place; Palisade, MN 56469; or e-mail sawmills_by_menc@yahoo.com .</p><p><strong>Sunflower Sheller</strong></p><p>I raise sunflower seeds for my granola cereal. I use a paint stripper on my electric drill to strip the seeds off the heads onto a large piece of plastic. Then I run the seeds through a Kirby upright vacuum cleaner to remove the shells. (To control the flow of the seeds to be shelled, I take off the bag and use a vacuum hose with plastic tape over half of the end.) The hose was attached in the normal way. It works great: Out of two bushels, only a few meats were cracked and only a few seeds didn't shell out.</p><p>The nut meats pile up about 20 inches beyond the exhaust. The larger chaff carries further. To remove the fine chaff, I put the meats in a pail of water and run water into it, until it overflows. The light chaff comes to the top and spills over the top with the additional water. I drain the water off and put the damp meats on a cookie sheet in a 230degree oven until they are dry.</p><p>LOYED SPOONER<br />Williamston, Michigan</p><p><strong>Washtub Compost</strong></p><p>I had taken the basin out of a discarded washing machine to use as a fire pit for camping but, as I live in California's San Bernadino Mountains where we are having really bad wildfire problems, I decided to find a safer use for the basin: I have filled it with my compost material. The basin's many small holes allow great air flow through the compost. For the most part, these basins can be found in any dump's piles of discarded metal. Hope this will help someone who might be wanting to buy a compost tumbler but doesn't want to spend the money.</p><p>ERIC PRESCOTT<br />Running Springs, Calffomia</p><p><strong>Golden Eggs</strong></p><p>If you grow marigolds and also have a chicken flock, harvest and dry the marigold flower heads and mix the petals with the hens' scratch. The yellow of their egg yolks will be an even more intense golden color thanks to the natural orange pigments in the marigolds. Some chickens even consider the petals a treat.</p><p>This tip is taken from a <em>National Geographic</em> special issue on color, which mentioned that some European countries regularly add marigold petals to their chickens' feed.</p><p>ANNE WEBER<br />Walton, Oregon</p><p><em>While this tip will give you brighter-colored</em><em>egg yolks, the marigolds won't make up for the</em><em>natural diet</em> of <em>weeds and insects that give eggs</em><em>from free-range chickens more color and more</em><em>nutrients. Free-range eggs have more vitamin</em><em>E, beta carotene and omega-3 fatty acids than</em><em>eggs from birds confined to houses.</em></p><p>-MOTHER</p><p><strong>Nixing Nicotine</strong></p><p>While my wife and I were attempting to kick the nicotine habit we were told by a friend that grapefruit juice is an excellent help. Personally, I hated grape fruit juice up until then, but I tried it and found that it really does influence the chemical balance in the mouth and helps stop nicotine cravings. Since I quit, I've actually found that I rather enjoy the taste. (My wife and I have both been off nicotine for more than four years now.)</p><p>STEPHEN KING<br />Wasilla, Alaska</p>
