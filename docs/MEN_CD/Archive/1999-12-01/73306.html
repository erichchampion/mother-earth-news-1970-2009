        <h5>by Joe Novara</h5><p><strong>G</strong>randpa, why do you need a 100-channel satellite dish if you only keep it tuned to the weather? I asked, staring at the TV perched on his refrigerator.</p><p>"Are you kidding? That's how I know how much to eat."</p><p>My grandfather's answer had something to do with horses. I knew it did. It always did. He has bred and raised horses all his life and somehow he thinks they hold the secret to healthy living.</p><p>"You might be in veterinary school, honey, but you can still learn more from watching horses than reading books about them."</p><p>"I'm sure you know more about horses than I ever will. Grandad. But I still don't see the correlation between the Weather Channel and your eating habits ."</p><p>"Why,. when it gets colder a horse will naturally eat more to keep its body heat up. "</p><p>"That's true. The other day in class we learned that for every degree drop in temperature below 15°F, a horse needs 0.7% more feed, and that's not counting windchill factor and wetness."</p><p>"Well, see now, I guess they're teaching you something up there in school."</p><p>"But they recommend roughage for the fermentation heat it generates in the gut. And I don't see any hay bales around here," I sarcastically remarked as I picked a Ding-Dong wrapper off the floor.</p><p>"Now don't get saucy with me, sweetie," Grandpa warned. "That's why I need the Weather Channel. So I can plan my shopping. Don't like to get caught short, like a couple of weeks ago when that arctic jet stream blew in and I ate everything in the house in one day. I like to stock up on rolled oats and molasses and All-Bran."</p><p>"All-Bran?" I asked.</p><p>"A person needs some forage, too, you know. Nothing like a warm bran mash to heat up your innards."</p><p>"But that ain't hay."<br /></p><p>"Well, you're right," Grandpa conceded. "I still can't find any way to eat hay. Although I did spend some time studying on shredded wheat. They look kinda like tiny bales of hay..."</p><p>"Gramps, there are other ways to keep warm - like using your potbelly stove."</p><p>"What? And fill the house with dry, stuffy air? Make a man sick, it would."</p><p>"So that's why you have the windows open when it's 20°F out?"</p><p>"A man needs clean air moving through - just like a horse. Alls you need do is add another coat as it gets colder and shed it when it gets warmer."</p><p>"Talk about shedding layers, Mom wanted me to invite you to join us in Florida for a couple of weeks."</p><p>"I been to the beach once. Took your mother and her brother. Don't need to go again."</p><p>"Mom predicted you would say that. She says you're like a furry, old winter horse fighting to stay in the barn but happy to be outside once you get warmed up."</p><p>"It ain't that. It's just not natural-stripping to your skin in winter. It's as dangerous as false spring, getting a man to take off his long johns too soon. A person could catch his death of cold getting his seasons all mixed up."</p><p>"Oh. Grandpa, don't make such a fuss. You'll love the sun and beach." "Ha!" the old man barked. "I told you. I've been to the beach. If I missed it that much, I could throw a couple buckets of sand on the kitchen floor, fire up the stove till it was steamy in here, turn on all the lights, every so often let a wet dog run by and shake water all over me and generally sit around in damp drawers all day. No sir. Like I said, I ain't interested in getting naked and wet in the winter."</p><p>I was about to say, "So I noticed," before moving on to the social consequences of his equine hygiene habits, when a frosty gust from the kitchen window tussled his dirty white mane and dissipated the outbuilding aroma that had been building up around him.</p><p>"Let's check the water out in the barn." Grandpa suggested as he headed for the door. "No sir," he shouted over his shoulder, snowflakes swirling around him, "you can't take a chance washing down a horse in winter. A bad chill can cause a lot more harm than a little dust and dirt."</p><p>Inside the barn, I pleaded, "C'mon, Gramps. I love horses, too. But if God had meant for us to live like animals he would have given us a winter coat every fall."</p><p>Grandpa, stooping to pick up a bale of hay, stopped and squinted his eyes at me. A sure sign of annoyance.</p><p>"And if God had meant for us to fly to Florida every winter he would have given us wings like the snowbirds."</p><p>"Okay, you win," I relented. "I'll play your game." Cracking the thin layer of ice forming in a bucket, I asked, "How' s your fluid intake?"</p><p>He looked at me, puzzled.<br /></p><p>"Are you drinking a lot of water? You know the average horse needs five gallons of water a day in the winter. Prevents impaction colic."</p><p>"Water?"<br /></p><p>"Yeah, water. If you're going to pattern your diet on livestock, you have to down a whole bunch of fluids."</p><p>'Water would freeze around here."</p><p>"So what do you drink?"<br /></p><p>"Beer. After all, you gotta draw the line somewhere."</p>
