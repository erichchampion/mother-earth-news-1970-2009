        <p>If ever you have been caught in a sudden rain or found yourself looking at the sky wondering how those dark clouds snuck up on you, there is a solution: garbage bags! Take any 30-gallon garbage bag and turn it upside down. Cut a hole for your head and one for each arm. Refold the bag. When it is needed, it slips over you like a poncho and saves most of you from getting wet.</p><p>Refolded, these homemade ponchos take up so little space you can keep them almost anywhere, and the cost is so low you can stash them almost everywhere. We made some (on a rainy day) and put them in every conceivable place where we might get caught outside. We taped one to the inside of the tractor hood, put one under a rock at the far end of the pasture, even put one in a knothole of a tree.</p><p>Recycle? Easy. If you use one, dry it out, refold and return to its original hiding place.</p><p><em>Terry Pruitt</em><em><br />Gadsden, Alabama</em></p>
