        		<p><strong>Country Lore</strong>	</p>	<p>    --------------------------</p>    		<p>     --------------------------</p><p>    I have heard of a few things to put on your fresh-kill meat    when in the field to protect it from flies and other bugs.    Some recommend, for example, that you pepper the meat    extensively. But I have just the thing to use so that not a    single bug will even land on your meat: saturate it with    Wesson Oil. Next time you're out hunting, bring along a    gallon of Wesson and a rag. When you are dressing your game    out to hang or carry back to town, saturate the rag and dab    it all over the meat. You can even fill your chain saw with    nothing but Wesson Oil to quarter your meat. That way, you    won't have to worry about cutting away the usual chain saw    oil later on.</p><p> Wesson Oil will make the outer layer of your    meat look a little dark, but if that bothers you, you can    always cut it away. So leave your pepper, salt or any other    remedies at home and instead take along some Wesson Oil.</p><p>    <em>Gail Peace<br />    Palmer, Alaska</em>	</p>
