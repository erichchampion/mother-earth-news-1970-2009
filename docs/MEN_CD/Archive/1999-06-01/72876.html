                          <p>      <strong><em>Producing the staff of life... from      scratch.</em></strong>    </p>      <h5 id="byline">        by: John Vivian      </h5>        			<p>      One or more species of grain can be produced in significant      quantities on garden-sized plots of land almost anywhere      that one or another variety of wild grass grows naturally.      Evolved to regrow quickly following the combined hoof      and-jaw predations of vast herds of grazing animals that      once roamed the globe, the cereal grasses are widely      adapted, tough, resilient, deep-rooted, fast growing and      easily propagated. The hard, long lived grains they produce      as seed can be grown, h arvested and milled in family sized      quantities with simple machines and elementary hand tools.      If properly cured and stored, they will keep for two or      three years or more. Which means that you and I can provide      our own organically grown, chemical-free flour, meal and      whole grains if we make the effort.</p><p> But not many of us do.      And small wonder: homegrown, ground and baked grain offers      little economic advantage so long as generic brand squishy      white bread costs less than a dollar a loaf, and we can buy      stone ground King Arthur flour for about 50 a pound.</p><p> Yet it      is deeply satisfying to be self-sufficient enough to serve      family or guests a sturdy peasant bread or skillet baked      corn cakes made from grain that you've grown and ground      yourself. The whole grain flavor and nutrition of breads      grown your own organic way, without harsh chemicals and on      your own land, will be better than anything you can get      from the supermarket. Guaranteed.    </p>        <p><em><strong>What's Involved</strong></em><br />      Other than lowland rice and North American wild rice, which      require full or part time flooding, cereal grains are      undemanding. They require full sun for optimum yield, but      will tolerate cool and cloudy climates, poor soils, small      amounts of water and a minimum of protection from pests and      weeds. Indeed, most grains germinate in only two days after      planting and wetting beating most annual weeds. And their      large, nutrition packed seeds fuel rapid root and top      growth. If planted densely enough, many cereal grains will      shade and crowd out most annual competition before tiny      weedlings have a chance to become established.</p><p> That's the      good news. The not so good news is that the yield from      cereal grain plantings is low compared to that of the      average garden row of green beans, tomatoes, lettuce,      broccoli or sweet corn.</p><p> <em><strong>Photo: COURTESY OF W.      ATLEE BURPEE ></strong></em></p><p> But garden produce is      harvested at either the lush, green, growing vegetative      stage (lettuce or spinach) or the fruiting or storage root      swelling stage (tomatoes, carrots). Fresh produce is mostly      plant sugar and water. Grain is the seed of the plant,      dried down to a water content of just 12% at maturity. Its      nutrients are converted from liquid plant sugars to dry      starch in order to over winter and fuel new growth in the      coming spring.</p><p> So yield per plant is measured in dry      ounces, not fluid pounds. And the land area needed to grow      a substantial crop is measured in acres, not square feet.      You should get 30 or more bushels of clean grain per acre      threshed to free it from stalks and outer husks and      winnowed to blow away the chaff.</p><p> Each bushel of whole grain      wheat weighs 60 pounds and nearly all of it is converted to      food if milled whole. That's the better part of 2,000      pounds or a short ton of grain per acre.</p><p> An acre comprises      43,000 square feet in area the equivalent of 43      approximately 30' x 30' hand-tended backyard garden plots.      If you till up a new garden sized plot and plant it to      winter wheat this fall, you will harvest 1/43 of a ton just      shy of a bushel or some 50 pounds of grain next May or      June.</p><p> You've probably harvested that weight in tomatoes      from a single row. But tomatoes are mainly water and      sugars, providing 60 calories of food energy per cup. Grain      is concentrated energy, containing 400 calories per cup.      The single bushel harvested from a 30' x 30' home-sized      garden won't fully nourish an individual or provide 40% of      family nutrition for more than a couple of weeks. But it      will let you serve super-fresh, all homegrown bread, rolls      or pan bread for holidays, parties and Sunday dinners over      the course of a year.<br />      <br />      <strong><em>Ground Preparation, CAre and      Rotation</em></strong><br /> A farm tractor and implements      are practically essential for tending an acre or more of      small grain, but their purchase, care and fueling can't be      justified by a smaller plot. Sit-on lawn and garden      tractors are designed to mow large suburban lawns and do      offer accessories such as mini-disc sets and small plows      that are fine for playing farmer in a small garden. But      they lack axle width, tire height, weight and torque/power      to handle even fraction-0f-an-acre-sized fields, and new      ones cost as much as a good used farm tractor. And don't      plan to use even the biggest rotary tiller to cut more than      a quarter acre of sod; it'll take several long, slow passes      to get the job done. If you need to plow more than a      quarter acre of new ground, rent a Boomer, Kubota or JD      4000 series with land plow, discs and harrow, or hire a      neighboring farmer.</p><p> Before planting a cereal grain, lime      your soil as needed and work it until it's as finely tilled      and weed-free as possible. You can cultivate row-planted      corn and drilled grains, but unless you use selective      herbicides, it's impossible to weed small grains planted to      optimum density by broadcasting the seed. Especially      important is to kill off all perennial weeds-particularly      the persistent meadow grass called witch grass or quack      grass that fills sod with a snarl of tough, white      underground jointed stems. If you try to plow it under or      till it in, you'll just cut the stems into pieces that'll      all make new plants. (You can, however, put this nuisance      weed to work by grinding it into flour. See page 58.)</p><p> The      best rule is to put grain into land that has been      cultivated for at least a year. One solution is to plant      your grain in an established garden plot and put your      vegetables into new ground that will be worked constantly      through the growing season.</p><p> Or plow new ground in late      summer when plant growth has slowed. Disc or till it      several times to kill sod and weeds and plan to use it as      next season's vegetable garden.</p><p> In early fall, plant to      winter wheat, rye or oats. The grain will sprout and make      strong root growth over fall and winter. Next spring, the      hardy grass will sprout and outgrow what weeds remain. You      can treat it as green manure and plow it in early, then      plant your sweet peas. Or let it mature and, following      early summer grain harvest, till in roots and straw. Then      set in tomato plants and plant the beans and sweet corn.      Plant last year's garden plot to a warm-weather grain such      as field corn.</p><p> Grain land will appreciate all the compost      you can give it. Apply organic concentrate fertilizer if      you can afford it; follow directions for growing lawn      grass.</p><p> A better solution all around is to rotate your land      among three or four crops, including nitrogen-fixing      legumes and green manures, each of which replenishes      nutrients used by the others. Corn, for example, is an      extra-heavy nitrogen feeder (but it produces three times      the nutrients of a small grain: 90-plus bu/acre as opposed      to 30-plus bu/acre of wheat). I have always grown      garden-sized to quarter-acre plots of field corn within a      three or more year rotation. The corn is followed by a      green manure legume such as alfalfa or field peas, followed      by a small grain or mixed vegetables. If time and space      permit, I continue with buckwheat or other green manure,      followed by a fallow year or two in which nature plants      what the soil needs.</p><p> In soybean country, farmers rotate      corn, soybeans, wheat and hay. In the Northeast, a mix of      corn, oats and hay/fallow is popular. In the western wheat      lands, corn, wheat, clover and grass/fallow are rotated. On      irrigated western land, three years of alfalfa are often      followed by potatoes, fertilized sugar beets and oats. In      cotton country, corn and cotton are alternated with a      legume such as alfalfa hay, cowpeas or soybeans.</p><p> See your      County Agent (or County Extension Office) for a good      schedule for your area and land, and substitute a fallow      year or a legume for commercial crops such as cotton or      sugar beets. You can substitute mixed garden crops for hay      or grass any year.<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>Planting</strong><br />      Local feed stores will carry varieties of cereal grain seed      that are best suited to your soil and climate. Most will be      high yielding, soil-depleting, but delicate hybrids.      Old-fashioned open-pollinated varieties can be found in      garden seed catalogs and from seed savers.</p><p> For planting      rates, see discussion of individual grains, starting on      page 54. For small plots, you'll get highest yield by      doubling the recommended rates.</p><p> Small-grain seed does best      if planted an inch and a half deep in well-prepared soil      that is kept evenly moist through the growing season. This      is deeper than we plant most garden seeds.</p><p> The cereal      grasses have a single cotyledon that remains below ground.      It sends a hollow sheath above ground and the narrow grass      leaves and stem emerge from this sheath. It benefits from      support of the surrounding soil. Seeds planted under dry      land conditions also benefit from being deep enough to stay      moist, even if the ground surface is bone dry.</p><p> The best way      to get seed deep enough is to use a drill that drops them      in a trench or hole. Farm scale drills are expensive and      require a sit-on tractor to pull them. One row drills are      available for large walking tractors (such as our 25      year-old Gravely 7.5). The patterns to make      1920s-eradesign, cast-iron, one row rotating plate seed      planters from the old Planet junior line are still extant;      several garden supply firms have sold these fine old small      farm tools over the years,</p><p> though the only place I have      seen them this year is in the Peaceful Valley Farm Supply      Catalog (see "Sources," page 98). Listed as Cole Planet Jr.      Seed Drills, they come in tractor pulled and hand pushed      versions for less than $500 (well worth the price if you      have a very big garden).</p><p> Lightweight, hand-pushed rotating      wheel planters made from plastic and aluminum are available      for well under $100. 1 tried one years ago and found it too      flimsy to work in anything but powder fine, bone-dry,      hobby-garden soil, and unable to handle anything but large      corn, pea or bean sized seed. But they've continued selling      for 30 years, so they must work for some gardeners.</p><p> Both      Cumberland General Store and Lehman's sell a hand operated      big-seed drill that functions like a cross between a pogo      stick and a clamshell post hole digger in reverse for      around $50. It sows at a slow walking speed, but works fine      for garden-sized plantings.</p><p> The timeless way to plant small      grain is to prepare the land, then sling a fabric sack over      one shoulder and hand broadcast grain in wide swaths. With      practice, on learn to manipulate hand and fingers to spread      seed evenly and to cover all the ground. Seed can be left      on top of the soil in the hope that rain will keep it moist      and the crows won't eat it all. But better is to rake, disc      or harrow it in. The easiest way I know to finish planting      is to fix a flat board spikeless harrow or drag on a pair      of chains behind the walking tractor and stand on the board      as it is pulled over the soil, rolling seed into trenches      or ridges and smoothing and firming soil over them.<br />      <br />      <strong><em>Small Scale Harvest</em></strong></p><p> On the farm,      small grains are harvested by huge self-propelled combines      that snow and thresh in a single pass. But for millennia      before the machine age, and in low-tech societies still,      grain was and is harvested entirely by hand. The crop is      left standing in the fields until kernels are almost-but      not quite-dry enough to separate from the husk and follow      their natural inclination to self-seed, by popping loose      when jostled by the wind.</p><p> To assure that grain is mature      enough to harvest, if not entirely cured to storage      quality, be sure the stalk has ceased nourishing the seed      head and that it's begun to die back. It will have lost its      fresh green color and will be less supple than when      growing. To test the kernels, bite one: It should be soft      enough to dent but not so soft that you can bite through      easily.</p><p> Cut while still semigreen; the kernels will stay on      the seed head. Small grains will cure rapidly if cut,      sheaved, shocked and left in the field during dry fall      weather. Shocks must be put under cover if prolonged rain      threatens. Moldy grain is worthless. If infected with ergot      mold, rye becomes toxic.</p><p> Corn can be left to dry on the      stalk and in the water-repelling husk, or can be pulled,      husked and dried on vented shelves or in a crib.</p><p> Small      amounts of grain can be "topped" the ends of stalks sheared      off and dropped into a harvest sack. It can be threshed in      the sack by rubbing stalks between the palms of horsehide      gloves. Or well dried, mature and loose kernels can be      removed from standing stalks by shaking into a sack or by      using a harvest rake similar to a blueberry rake a wooden      scoop with a coarse-toothed comb fastened at the lip.      Johnny's Selected Seeds sells a metal rake designed for      harvesting chamomile blooms; it works on seedpods as well.      If the teeth were narrowed, say by addition of a steel      currycomb at the toothed edge of the lip, it would harvest      small grain.</p><p> lost commonly, grain is hand harvested stalk      and all-by harvest knives that pass through the stalks      close to and parallel to the ground. Cut stalks are      collected by the large handful, called a sheaf. Sheaves are      bound near the top with supple barren tillers-secondary      stems that grow from most grain plants' bases (you've seen      them on sweet corn) but that fail to make seed. Two or      three sheaves are stacked against one another-tops      intertwined and bottoms lodged in the stubble. Then, other      sheaves are "tepeed" onto them to form a shock large enough      to put both arms around and are bound near the top.</p><p> The      most sophisticated harvest knife is the long-handled,      two-hand scythe, which permitted the 18th-century harvester      to stand (or, more properly, to stoop) while mowing and      stacking an acre an hour. Wooden fingers or frame cradles      were attached on the off side of some grain harvest scythes      to catch the stalks for easy one-handed pickup.</p><p>      Short-handled harvest knives vary in size and shape. The      machete and other heavy, long knives are used to cut the      large stalks of sugar cane, sorghum and corn. The      traditional harvest tool for small grains is the grain hook      or sickle-a curved knife fastened at a shallow right angle      to a wooden handle.</p><p> For small lot grain or cane harvesting,      I remain loyal to the Collins made U.S. M-1 machete I was      issued by the Marine Corps. Using it or a hooked harvest      knife is stoop, duck-waddle, or scoot-along-on your-butt      labor. Pick your torture.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>Power - moving</strong></em><br />      For plantings measured in acres or significant fractions      thereof, hand mowing is for masochists only, in my sciatic      view. MOTHER's Gravely has a front-mounted sickle bar mower      attachment hat cuts with a row of sharpened teeth, which      move back and forth over a ground-hugging floating bar of      fixed it. But its 700 pounds, not to mention he operator's      own clodhoppers, can't help but crush the grain, losing      more ham a few kernels in the stubble.</p><p> You can get smaller      dedicated power sickle bar mowers, as well as      still-operating antique horse-drawn sickle bar mowers that      sport a seat so you can ride on the job. These go well with      still-common, still - functioning horse-drawn hayracks that      collect grain stalks in a huge set of curving spring teeth      and dump the load by being raised up with a handle. Keeping      a matched pair of these 18th-century horse-powered      harvesting machines in operation into the 21st century just      might be enough of a reason o take on a draft animal.</p><p> But      my nominee for the best small plot small-grain harvester      ever is the DR Trimmer-Mower from Country Home Products.      This machine is a wheeled, amply powered string trimmer. It      lacks power to the wheels, so you do have to push it. But      it is nicely balanced and the revolving string head cuts a      wide swath through any small grain. You could power mow      grain with a little handheld string trimmer, I suppose, but      the stalks and seed heads will fall and get chopped and      snarled as you go. The DR lays the stalks to one side in a      neat windrow so they can be raked or picked up and sheathed      easily.</p><p> Neither string cutters nor sickle bars will cut      standing corn, sorghum or other canes. I pull green ears      and feed fresh stalks to the livestock. Flour corn is left      to dry on the stalk. After the harvest, the stalks are      hand-pulled and shredded or piled in long windrows and      burned. If left standing over winter, they are the very      devil to till in come spring and, unless a good dicing is      scheduled, the tangled mess they make of tiller tines      volunteers the plot to rest fallow for an entire      year.<br />      <br />      <strong><em>Threshing</em></strong></p><p> The kernels of cereal      grasses develop inside several layers of bran and husk,      which nurture them as they sprout from stems or cobs.      Kernels of oats and some other species are accompanied by      ornamental awns (whiskers) and all manner of inedible      matter that is loosely termed chaff. Kernels must be freed      from this stuff in a mechanical process called threshing.      Commercially today, easily dehusked grain such as wheat is      threshed by being bashed with flails as it moves on a      conveyor belt or inside a revolving drum. Other grains such      as barley or conventional oats are so tightly held in their      husk that they must be steamed or ground in a mill to be      freed.</p><p> More traditional and easiest to manage on a small      place is to lay the grain out and whack it with hand      flails-foot long lengths of wood attached with leather      thongs to a longer handle. Or else, you can hold sheaves by      the ground end and bang seed heads over a "threshing      horse"-a big log, for instance, or a gallon oil drum. The      stalks, once kernel free (and properly termed wheat straw,      oat straw or whatever) are bundled and set aside for      livestock bedding or straw-tick mattresses or even for      building a straw-sheaf house, while the grain is taken to      be winnowed.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>Winnowing</strong></em></p><p> Grain is winnowed, or      separated from the loose hulls or chaff, by tossing or      dropping newly threshed grain in a brisk wind (or, for more      control, in front of an electric fan or blower). Large      (three-foot diameter) round, shallow baskets are used for      threshing in many different cultures. In a maneuver that      takes practice, the grain is shuffled out to the far rim of      the basket and flipped up on a breezy day, then caught as      it falls back. The dry matter is separated from the heavier      grain kernels and carried downwind. Chaff contains      nourishing bran and is commonly swept up and used as      livestock feed.</p><p> <em><strong>Polishing</strong></em><br />      <br />      Our advice? Don't Polishing grain is a sin against nature      if ever there was one. Fortunately, there is no practical      way to polish grain on a small scale.</p><p> Grains exist to      sprout into young plants, so they've evolved to keep a      tight hold on their stores of concentrated, water soluble      carbohydrates (starch) and their live plant embryos (germ),      by enclosing them in tightly held protective inner husks      (bran). Most of a grain's vitamins and minerals are      contained in the fibrous bran and in the oils of the living      germ. If freed from the protective husk, as when milled,      the oils can become rancid and the starch can mold or dry      out, while the bran adds a chewy roughness to the grain.      For long storage of the milled product and to give a more      refined appearance and texture to the cooked dish,      commercial producers have long done their best to reduce      grain to bleached-white, empty carbohydrates. Enrichment of      polished rice and white flour was federally mandated      decades ago to improve child nutrition, particularly in      impoverished areas of the country such as Appalachia and      the Mississippi delta. Fair enough, but didn't anyone think      of leaving the original nutrients in place?<br />      <br />      <em><strong>Grain Storage</strong></em></p><p> If the weather lets      you keep shocked or standing small grain in the field till      it is a uniform light tan, with no green stems even in the      middle of the shock and stalks of standing corn sound      hollow when you tap them, it will almost surely be storage      dry at 10% to 15% moisture content. Flour corn kernels      should be hard, with a characteristic dent in the middle of      the upper surface. Small grain should be firm, but a little      plump in the middle. Tooth test it: Grains should dent a      little, but not much. If they squash and are easy to bite      in half, they need more drying. Move shocks into the barn      if you can; stack upright on the floor or hang them head      sup from the overhead. Or thresh and lay small grain out in      a thin layer on a tarp or on screen shelves someplace where      the air moves freely. Pull corn ears, shuck (but leave      husks attached in a rosette) and lay out or bag. The husks      will aid in air circulation.</p><p> It is easiest to shell (remove      kernels) from corn ears as grain is needed. If done all at      once, you'll have bags of grain to store, and you'll find      that a large pile of shelled cobs and husks is hard to      dispose of before it gets rained on and begins to rot,      unless you have a powerful shredder grinder and plenty of      ornamentals in need of mulch, or a spreader to put them on      the land. Shelled a few at a time as needed, dry cobs find      their way into the wood stove as kindling.</p><p> Husking knives      and hand-shellers used by the nonelectric Amish are always      a possibility. Be sure to use gloves when removing      sharp-edged dry husks. You can shell dry corn by rubbing      two cobs together briskly; one will remove kernels from the      other. Have plenty of hand lotion at the ready.</p><p> Commercial      granaries use huge fans to move air over drying corn and      small grains. If air in your drying shed is humid, or if      you see mold growing, you may want to apply dry heat via an      electric heater with a fan, a kerosene salamander or heat      lamps.</p><p> During dry fall and winter weather, grain is best      stored in a weather-proof, outside, slat-sided crib that      keeps blowing rain out, but permits a constant floe of air      (see page 60). Leave corn on the cob with husk pulled down,      but attached for bulk storage. Cob corn or any loose grain      can be kept in coarse-meshed sacks. Ideal are the 50-pound,      woven poly-ribbon sacks that stock feed comes in. Or use      poly-strip sandbags from an Army Navy surplus outlet or      mail-order catalog. To minimize mold damage, fill bags      halfway and lay out on shelves or a dry floor in single      layers. Turn daily. Set up on end if moisture shows under      any. Flip to rest on alternate ends daily. If any mold      shows, lay out a large tarp and pour grain out in a single      layer during dry, sunny weather. Remove and discard any      kernels that are clumped with white mold roots or that show      dark spores. Except for rye (which can be infected with      toxic ergot), the remaining grain can be washed well and      consumed, oven-dried or parched in hot oil and put into      cold storage.</p><p> For next year's seed, select the fattest,      thickest seed heads or kernels. Dry them especially well.      Store in a cool place where they will experience at least      several months of freezing weather, as many seeds need cold      during winter dormancy. An open-mesh bag hung where the      mice can't get it is best if you doubt the seed's dryness.      Don't store inside where it is warm or you are asking for      weevils.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>Milling</strong></em></p><p> An individual whole grain      of rice or corn is called a kernel, while wheat, oats and      other small grains are called berries. Whole kernels or      berries can be boiled and eaten as stick in our teeth (as      well as to your ribs) groats. Crushed by hand or in the      rollers of a cracking or rolling mill, they become      faster-cooking cracked grain gruel. Oatmeal, or rolled      oats, falls into this category.</p><p> In a grist mill, they are      forced from a hopper by an auger to be ground between      ridges cut into the face of a set of milled steel,      cast-iron or gritty stone burrs. Distance between grinding      burrs is easily adjustable. Wide-spaced burrs produce a      coarse meal such as cornmeal or dehulled (like hominy)      wheat farina. With burrs closely spaced, any grain from      wheat to rice to corn can be finely ground into flour.      Metal burrs will grind anything, though not as finely as      stone burrs, which can clog if milling an oily seed such as      peanuts.</p><p> A modern high-capacity semicommercial stone mill      such as CGS's Meadows 30" burr Mealmaster (which retails      for $6,900) will fine-grind an acre's output of corn or      wheat-a good 30 bu-in an hour.</p><p> Smaller "community-sized"      mills such as Meadows 1-hp stone mill is sold, with      electric motor and shields, by Lehman's for about $1,200.      It can fine-grind a pound of grain in 30 seconds.</p><p>      Home-scale electric mills in the under$500 range such as      Retsel's X-hp MilRite can stone-grind a cup of grain cake      flour fine in less than two minutes.</p><p> There is a variety of      imported and U.S.made old timers such as the original      Quaker City, as well as innovative new mills, including      Lehman's exclusive Our Best Grain Mill, that fall into the      $150 to $250-plus range. All are capable and many offer a      choice of hand or electric power, stone or steel burrs, and      come in a variety of materials and capacity ranges.</p><p> Large,      long-handled, heavy at 15 pounds, under $100, cast iron      hand mills on the Quaker City pattern, such as the      Universal Mill or Corona, are imported from Medalin,      Columbia. Their relatively crude, sand-cast-iron burrs take      two to three minutes to grind a pound of grain to cornmeal      consistency, and half-again longer or more if you put it      through twice to produce bread flour.</p><p> Compact      herb/nut-grinder-type mills. such as the handy little      Back-To-Basics mill with its easily cleaned stainless steel      burrs, will grind a pound of grain into flour in a single      easy pass, but need eight or ten minutes to get it done.</p><p> In      a class by itself is the uniquely powerful Vitamin      food-processor/juicer/blender/universal mill. Rigged for      dry grind, it will make pancake flour from two cups of      whole grain in 90 seconds. Rigged for wet, it will mix and      pour the batter, then clean itself afterward.</p><p> Do your      homework and be sure to check the Internet, too-sic your      search engine on "grain mills." One warning: many of the      gristmill makers are small firms that strive for quality      rather than quantity production. With the Y2K scare selling      self-sufficiency apparatus like never before, manufacturers      of several of the very best models are months behind at      this time (summer of '99) and not foolish enough to add      capacity to meet a panic-fueled demand that will evaporate      in a few months.</p><p> So check availability if you need fast      delivery. Or wait till the Y2K panic (it has long been our      contention that Y2K is more marketing tool than root of      global catastrophe) passes and buy a used mill.</p><p> Don't grind      any more whole grain than you'll use in a week or it may      sour, mold or become weevil-infested. To prevent these      problems any other way, you'd need a whole arsenal of toxic      chemicals.</p><p> <strong><em>TIME REQUIREMENT</em></strong></p><p> Using      a powerful rotary tiller to prepare the land and a powered      string trimmer to cut small grain-and in between doing all      the planting and cultivating by hand or with the wheel hoe      I put in close to four hours per bushel of corn or wheat:      at least one hour each to plant, harvest, thresh and      winnow. Assembling the equipment and putting it away more      than doubles the time required. I need a half or even a      full day to accomplish each task (and I could do several      times the land and crop in that time. Moral: grow more      rather than less grain once you get into it.)</p><p> If all of      this seems like a lot of time and effort to turn out a few      loaves of bread or bowls of porridge-which modern farm and      food technology can produce in minutes and for pennies a      pound you are correct. Taut it takes effort to be able to      feed (air family no matter what might happen out in the      world. And there is no more basic place to begin than      growing good bread from scratch.    </p>        <h3>      Amaranth    </h3>    <p>      Amaranth is not a grass, but a four-to six-foot-tall,      broad-leafed plant that produces edible (when cooked)      greens, plus highly ornamental plumes, which develop      legions of tiny round seeds more nutritious than any cereal      grass. Good for people who are allergic to wheat or corn.    </p>    <p>      Sow the seed in flats in early spring. Thin the      slow-growing seedlings to the most robust individuals in a      variety of colors and heights (stems contain traces of the      red, orange and yellow that occur vividly in the plumes).      When soil is thoroughly warm, weed well and set out      seedlings one to two feet apart, in rows spaced two to      three feet (the closer set, the better plants will resist      "lodging," or falling over in wind or rain, a serious      problem that can wipe out your grain).    </p>    <p>      Cultivate closely till plants are growing rapidly. Water      only if soil is dry for several inches down. Harvest in      late summer, any time after a tap on plumes loosens seeds.      It's best to wait till after frost so seeds are bone-dry.      Hand-harvest by cutting seed heads into a sack or bucket.      Dry on a tarp if needed.    </p>    <p>      Shake or flail seed heads to remove seed. Sift through two      screens: one of coarse hardware cloth (1"-mesh or so) and      the second a coarse kitchen strainer or X"-mesh window      screening. During screening or later, rub seed between your      palms to scarify the thin outer coating. This will winnow      away with a light wind.    </p>    <p>      Whole or crushed seed can be boiled for porridge using a      1:2 grain-to-water ratio. It will pop, too, in a hot pan      with no oil; add one spoonful at a time, stirring      constantly. Takes only a few seconds unless too old and      dry.    </p>    <p>      Grind to flour on fine setting. Substitute for wheat flour      up to 50% in panbread recipes. Experiment in combination      with cornstarch, tapioca and arrowroot flour for      hypoallergenic muffins and nut breads. Amaranth lacks      gluten, so it won't make good yeast bread unless mixed with      wheat flour.    </p>    <p>      Quinoa is another ancient Andean plant that produces      abundant tiny seeds. Grown, harvested and used the same as      Amaranth, it's available from Seeds of Change (see      "Sources," page 98.)    </p>         <p>      <strong>Corn</strong>    </p>    <p>      Corn comes in several species and thousands of varieties.      Familiar sweet corn is grown for its high sugar content      when green, and isn't even, able to resist developing      starch at maturity. Don't bother trying to dry and grind it      like I did years ago. It makes a gummy, nasty-tasting meal.      The flint corns sold as ornamental Indian (multicolored)      are better for animal feed than cornmeal. It's the plump      ears of flour corn, which come in many colors, and the big      dent-kerneled yellow field corns that make good meal and      flour. You'll have to try several to see which ones work      best on your place.    </p>    <p>      Plant corn in well-separated blocks of at least four rows;      it is wind-pollinated, and separation helps keep varieties      true to type. Plant seed 1" to 1X" deep in cool, moist      spring soil. Otherwise, two to three inches deep in      well-prepared warm soil. Drop in a trench or drill four      seeds to a foot, rows 24" to 48" apart depending on      rainfall-farther apart in the dry west. Thin seedlings to      8" to 10" for high yield in well-watered areas, to 24" in      drylands. Give the robust dent corns that throw tillers      (auxiliary stalks) more space. Hill soil around roots to      kill weeds and support stalks.    </p>    <p>      Corn is a heavy feeder. To help replenish nutrients, till      husks, stalks and cobs back in and interplant legumes such      as cornfield beans; harvest the dry pods along with the      corn. Pull late tillers as they sprout and runty lower ears      before they swell.    </p>    <p>      Let ears dry on the stalk as long as you can. On the stalk      or in storage, mature corn will mold and can develop toxic      aflatoxins, most particularly from Aspergillus flavus. In      the South, and in the North if you are sure they're dry,      crib or dry-store ears in the husk to keep out pests.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wheat</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are two kinds of wheat. Soft wheat is traditionally a      southern crop. It lacks gluten and is best for cakes and      biscuits. Hard, red wheat is bread wheat and is grown      primarily in cooler areas.    </p>    <p>      Either kind can be planted as "winter wheat" in September      and harvested from late May in Texas to July 21 in the      North. In the far northern tier, it is better planted as      "spring wheat" between February and April and harvested in      June and July.    </p>    <p>      Sowing rates vary between two to eight pecks per acre and      doubling the rate or better is often recommended,      especially if broadcast and not raked in. (A peck is eight      quarts or one quarter of a bushel and weighs about 15      pounds.) But the thinner the sowing rate, the more tillers      (secondary stems) are produced. Yield varies more with      rainfall and temperature. A sowing rate of six pecks per      acre is a good starting point.    </p>    <p>      Unless you live in wheat-growing country, you'll rarely      experience significant pest problems if you rotate every      year and use varieties bred to be resistant to locally      important problems. The worst disease, stem rust, is an      airborne fungus. Eliminating a secondary host, barberry      bushes, around your wheat fields can help.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oats</strong>    </p>    <p>      The common Avena species is a fast-growing cereal grain      that is easy to grow and makes great hay and stock feed.      But its hull is inedible unless you are a horse and hard to      remove without polishing, parching or parboiling. So grow      A. nuda (from Johnny's Selected Seeds and others), which      needs threshing and winnowing like wheat, but is nearly      ...well, nude. In early spring, sow 100 pounds per acre or      two to three pounds per 30' x 30' plot. Best in the cool      northeast quarter of the U.S. and lower southeast section      of Canada, but grows anywhere and can be fall-sown in the      South.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Rye and Triticale</strong>    </p>    <p>      Secale cereal and triticale (tri-t-cal'-ee), the more      refined cross between rye and wheat, are extremely      winter-hardy. They can be sown as late as November and      still produce a crop next summer. And they'll tolerate less      rain, worse soil and more neglect and abuse than any other      grain. Grows so fast it is self-weeding. Plant a locally      adapted variety, at two bu/acre or four to ten pounds per      30' x 30' plot.    </p>    <p>      Nearly as nourishing as wheat, it has no gluten, but makes      a dark, chewy leavened peasant bread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOURCES BOOKS</strong><br />      <em>The New Book of Whole Grains: More Than 200 Recipes      Featuring Whole Grains, Including Amaranth, Quinoa, Wheat,      Spelt, Oats, Rye, Barley and Millet, by Marlene Anne      Bumgarner, (1997, St. Martin's Press) The Scythe Book:      Mowing Hay, Cutting Weeds and Harvesting Small Grains With      Hand Tools, by David Tresemer (1996, Alan C.
