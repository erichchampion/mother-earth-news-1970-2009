                <p>      <strong>BITS AND PIECES</strong><br />    </p>    	<p>Is it time to terminate the terminator?		</p>        			<p>				In      March 1998, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Delta      and Pine Land Company obtained a patent for their jointly      developed "Technology Protection System." TPS, or      "terminator" seeds as they've been dubbed by their      adversaries, produce plants that are genetically programmed      to kill their own embryos. Second-generation seeds are thus      sterile and cannot be saved for next year's planting.      Proponents of TPS argue that, by compelling gardeners and      farmers to buy new seed annually, the technology will      ensure the financial incentives necessary to encourage      researchers to genet really engineer crops that are, for      instance, drought or pest resistant (such genetic traits      would be "stacked" onto TPS). Opponents insist the inherent      dangers far outweigh any potential benefits and are calling      for a ban on the technology.</p><p> Nine weeks after the patent      was issued, Delta and Pine signed an agreement to merge      with Monsanto, an industry giant that, since 1996, has      spent $8 billion acquiring seed and biotechnology      interests, making it the second largest seed company in the      world. (The Delta/Monsanto merger now hinges on justice      Department approval.)</p><p> Critics worry that if Monsanto      manages to corner an even larger chunk of the global      growers market while at the same time reducing the repeat      viability of seeds-the result will be economic hardship for      farmers, particularly those in poor, underdeveloped      nations.</p><p> But beyond the economic concerns, say opponents,      lie an array of potential ecological and agricultural      risks. including cross-pollination with-and thus      sterilization of neighboring crops.</p><p> In response to the      above and other loudly voiced concerns, Delta and Pine Vice      President of Technology Transfer Harry B. Collins notes      that farmers worldwide have already embraced such feats of      genetic engineering as inbred herbicides. "Given the      opportunity, farmers will go to the technology," he says.      Yet, with public funds for agricultural research on the      decline, the future of such technology depends, argues      Collins, on guaranteeing private researchers a return on      their investment.</p><p> Longtime champion of sustainable      agriculture Will Rapp isn't buying it. There is, he argues,      "no agronomic benefit" to the use of terminator seeds. As      founder and president of the Vermont-based Gardener's      Supply Company, Rapp is at the forefront of a grassroots      letter-writing campaign calling for a halt to the      development of terminator technology and a moratorium on      the further patenting of plant genes.</p><p> <em>-Heatber Cox</em></p><p>      <strong>Sources:</strong></p><p> <strong>·</strong>For      more on the anti-terminator campaign, contact Gardener's      Supply Co., (8021880-3500, or visit the Web at      www.gardeners.com.<br />      <strong>·</strong> For more information on TPS,      consult: "How the Terminator Terminates," by Mary L.
