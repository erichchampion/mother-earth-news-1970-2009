Instead, why not use this super-simple, four-step method      and let the sun do the work for you!    </p>    <p>      [1] Find a half-gallon glass jug and fill be      container-up to an inch from its top-with cool      water. (Orange or grapefruit juice bot tles work fine, but      any vessel will do ... as long as the bottle's neck is wide      enough to admit tea bags and the glass is clear, rather      than frosted or tinted.)    </p>    <p>      [2] Hang five regular-sized tea bags (or an equivalent      amount of leaves in a teaball) in the water. Then cap the      jug tightly, letting the lid hold your bags in place. (if      you prefer weaker "sippin's", use only four of the little      leaf holders, but if you want your infusion    </p>    <p>      "too thick to drink and too thin to plow", try six tea      sacks.    </p>    <p>      [3] Place the brewing flask outdoors-in direct      sunlightand take a peek at the beverage every half hour or      so ... to make sure ol' Sol's diurnal movement hasn't left      your drink in the lurch (i.e., shade).    </p>    <p>      [4] Come back in two or three hours (or a bit later if the      day's a tad cloudy or cool), and grab your juice. 'Tain't      no more to it! The finished brew will be ready for drinking      (if you serve it with ice). Or you can refrigerate the      sun's "shine" until the next time a parching thirst scrapes      the sides of your tonsils.    </p>    <p>      How does this solar brewing process work? Simple! The water      in the glass stops and absorbs the sun's radiant heat. Then      this closed "heat collector" starts the tea flavor to      leaking out of the bags, which in turn makes the water      darker, which-in turn again-makes the whole mix      absorb more sunlight ... and so on and so on until your tea      is deeply steeped.    </p>    <p>      And, once you've got the hang of this operation (that      should, indeed, take no more than one try), you can do some      experimenting to spice up the flavor a bit. Substitute a      bag of green or herb tea for one of "traditional" orange      pekoe, for instance. You could also throw in some sassafras      bark, mint leaves, dried lemon or orange rind, cinnamon . .      . or create your own savory invention!    </p>    <p>      Whatever tangy combination you settle on, though, you'll      find-as I do-that the gentle heat of solar brewing      gives your "sunshine tea" a much smoother and less bitter      taste than that ol' 'biled water" residue has    </p>    <p>      So the next time you're planning to fix up some refreshing      iced tea ... don't you do it.
