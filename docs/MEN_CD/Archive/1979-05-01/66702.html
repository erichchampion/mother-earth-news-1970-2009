                    <p>      <strong><em>Ralph Bullock has made it easier than ever to      "go underground"!</em></strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by TERRI CALVERT    </h5>    <p>      Earth-she ed and underground homes are certainly nothing      new to MOTHER's readership. After all, this magazine has      been touting the advantages of such dwellings (low fuel      costs, minimal maintenance, and superior durability      <em>...</em> to name a few) for some time now.    </p>        <p>      Recently, however, we've come across a new concept which      might just alter the course of the whole "underground"      movement <em>...</em> that of building an earth-sheltered      dwelling from preformed, fiberglass-reinforced plywood      panels!    </p>    <p>      As most of us already know, the great majority of      subterranean dwellings are at present made of concrete,      poured into forms that have been carefully set into      excavations. However, while this method does assure a      rock-solid structure, the entire process can be expensive      <em>...</em> and often forces the owner to hire a      professional work crew to achieve satisfactory results. Not      only that, concrete-because of its porous      nature-must be thoroughly protected from the effects      of moisture <em>...</em> which will tend to seep through      even the thickest of slabs and can actually      <em>deteriorate</em> the cement-and-sand mixture.    </p>    <p>      But now Ralph Bullock (of American Solartron Corporation)      has-after two years of research-come up with an      alternative to the usual underground building materials      <em>...</em> and his "answer" is fiber-glass!    </p>    <p>      Strange as it may seem, Ralph wasn't <em>looking</em> for a      concrete substitute when he made Ids discovery. In Met he      had set out to develop and market a low-cost alternative to      "standard" subterranean construction <em>...</em> and hoped      to accomplish his goals by precasting concrete slabs and      joining them together-at the building site-to form a      "finished" structure.    </p>    <p>      Upon investigation, though, Mr. B. discovered that a      prefabricated concrete home just wasn't feasible: "It was      far too heavy to transport in sections, and even worse, the      finished house would have been overly expensive      <em>...</em> that's when we decided to try other      materials." The "other material" that Ralph settled on was      fiberglass, which is strong, inexpensive, lightweight,      water resistant, fireproof, non biodegradable, and known      for Its terrific insulative properties. Furthermore, this      amazing substance has-for years-been used      successfully in the manufacture of septic tanks, sewer      lines, boats, and railroad cars <em>...</em> applications      that demand a high degree of durability.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the individual "Solartron" panels are not made      up of fiberglass <em>alone.</em> Instead, a section A 5/8"      construction-grade plywood that measures 8' X 9'4"?is      "framed out" with 2 X 6's <em>...</em> which are glued and      nailed on 16" centers and also fastened around the board's      perimeter. Then the entire assembly is laminated with      Hetron 92 FS (a fire-retardant resin) and covered with      layers of fiberglass and resin-alternately till a panel      thickness of 7-1/8" is eventually achieved. Finally, a      fine-mesh 'glass veil is laminated to the exterior of the      wall <em>...</em> to guarantee a virtually waterproof      outside surface.    </p>    <h3>      "BUILDING BLOCK" CONSTRUCTION    </h3>        <p>      Because the wall components only weigh 300 pounds apiece      (and the larger roof sections 500 pounds), each Individual      segment is a real featherweight when compared to its      concrete counterpart. And-due to the fact that the      panels are designed to interlock (through the use of      tongue-and-groove or shiplap joints)-the standard      1,231-square-foot (exterior dimensions) home shown here can      be constructed in about <em>eight hours</em> by an      experienced work crew <em>...</em> once the excavation is      finished and the foundation footings are laid.    </p>    <p>      To assure full water-resistance, the roof sections are      "glued" to the upper edges of the walls with a bead of      pliable silicone sealant, and the completed "cube" is      covered with a solid piece of heavy-duty, 6-mil plastic      sheeting. Next, round river rocks?3/4" to 1-1/2" in      diameter-are poured over the entire      structure-to a depth of two feet on the sides and      four inches on the roof creating a "drainage layer". In      addition, the roof is convex (to shed seepage and prevent      the accumulation of standing water), and a network of      drains is installed around the building's foundation.    </p>    <p>      Finally, a layer of earth-between two and three feet      thick-is placed on top of the fiberglass "box",      and-if the dwelling is only partially      underground-additional soil is bermed up against any      protruding portion of its walls (with the exception of the      front of the house, which is fully exposed). Once this is      done, grass and shrubbery can be planted over the entire      earthen cover to stabilize the soil and add aesthetic      appeal to the residence.    </p>    <h3>      THE TEST OF STRENGTH    </h3>    <p>      Naturally, one of the most important concerns in      <em>any</em> subterranean house is structural strength.      After all, statistics show that three feet of soil when      covered with a foot of snow will exert 360 pounds per      square foot of pressure on the surface below.    </p>    <p>      A Solartron roof panel, however, is rated to support a      pressure of 550 pounds per square foot, and in fact was      proven - by an independent testing laboratory -      to remain intact under a total surface load of 23,038      pounds ... with a deflection of only about 1/2' in the      center of the panel. And the wall components are even      stronger: Test results show that those panels can withstand      an amazing 183,000 pounds before ultimate failure! So,      regardless of what the skeptics say, earth-covered      dwellings are actually a good deal <em>safer</em> than      conventional homes ... and are, of course, especially      resistant to storm damage or vandalism.    </p>    <h3>      IT SAVES MONEY COMING AND      GOING    </h3>    <p>      Since the idea of prefabricated, modular earth-sheltered      homes is relatively new (as is the entire "underground      living" concept), you might expect such a home to carry a      hefty price tag. Fortunately, however, the cost of building      a Solartron house is equal to (and in some cases less than)      that of erecting a conventional aboveground structure ...      with the final "tab" averaging out at about $40 to $45 per      square foot depending on location, type of soil, and depth      of excavation.    </p>    <p>      But that's only part of the story ... the real savings come      after the house is built. Because it's protected by a layer      of earth, the fiberglass home is reluctant to give up its      heat ... and actually absorbs a good deal of thermal energy      from the soil around it (which-below the frost      line-remains at a constant 55Â°F all year round) -    </p>    <p>      In order to have an accurate "Yardstick" with which to      measure his home's thermal efficiency, Mr. Bullock asked      the local power company to supply him with estimated annual      energy consumption figures for heating and cooling his      "model" Illinois residence. Ralph found that-even      with the terrific loss of heat resulting from the coming      and going of some 15,000 interested people who visited the      dwelling during its winter-of-1978 open house-his      actual utility costs during the cold month of December were      only $15.75. And, using that figure as a reference, the      power company "guesstimated" that such expenses for an      entire <em>Year</em> wouldn't exceed $128!    </p>    <p>      It should be remembered, too, that these energy-use "tests"      were made in a residence with an open courtyard. if the      pat& had been closed in (a Solartron option), the      amount of cash saved would have been even more significant!      Furthermore, considerably <em>greater</em> savings could be      realized with the installation of an efficient woodburning      stove ... the already low utility bills might even be cut      in half!    </p>    <p>      The Solartron home is "thrifty" for other reasons, too.      Exterior maintenance on the structure is kept to a minimum      because only one wall is exposed (and even that is par      tially covered with a rock facade to reduce periodic      upkeep). Insurance rates are at so lower for "underground"      dwellings. One guarantee firm in the Land of Lincoln      presently offers a 25% premium reduction for      earth-sheltered abodes, and others are estimating that the      figure could reach 40-45% in the near future. Furthermore,      the Illinois Insurance Commission soon hopes to approve a.      33% rate cut on all fire policies underwritten to owners of      subterranean homes. (Similar benefits are already      available-or should soon be offered-all over the United      States.)    </p>    <h3>      AND THAT AIN'T ALL ...    </h3>    <p>      The new American Solartron home      is-obviously-far superior to a conventional      above ground structure ... but it <em>al</em> so compares      very favorably with its subterranean "cousins". Adequate      ventilation is provided through a duct system, and-if      you study the floor plan-you'll see that every room      in the building is equipped with a window that will admit      natural light ... thanks to a courtyard which is bathed in      sunshine throughout the course of the day. This source of      daylight guarantees that the fiberglass dwelling is      <em>not</em> stuffy, dark, or damp. In fact, it might just      be a whole lot brighter than some "exposed" houses.    </p>    <p>      The courtyard provides other advantages, too: If it's left      open to the outdoors, it acts as a fresh air patio and      additional ventilation source. (The open area can also-with      the addition of a stairway-function as an additional      entrance/exit.) On the other hand, if the owner should      choose to close in this veranda (by simply installing a      series of roof joists and covering them with glazing or      plext glass), an effective solarium would be created ...      not only providing a comfortable year round lounge or      recreation area, but also producing an excellent      environment for a greenhouse or hydroponic gar den (not to      mention the fact that the additional insulation gained by      the use of such a roof will help to "temper" the home's      atmosphere).    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, because of the "modular" design of the, house,      there are numerous variations on the "theme" presented      here. You'll note that each room is 12 feet in width ...      for proper support of the roof panels. So-as long as that      dimension is allowed for- the various chambers can be      arranged in any number of ways, to permit an almost      unlimited diversity of style.    </p>    <p>      In Oct, the Solartron people now have several      <em>hundred</em> designs and floor plans available      that-they hope will cover the spectrum of potential      customers' needs. These blueprints encompass split-level      and two-story styles, and even include patterns for hotels,      motels, and office buildings.    </p>    <h3>      YOU CAN "DO IT YOURSELF" AND SAVE    </h3>    <p>      In contrast with many other earth sheltered dwellings which      are custom designed, custom-built, and carry an equally      "custom" price tag Ralph Bullock's package is just the      thing for a buyer who wants to take part in the building of      his or her house. Ralph has done all of the "home- and his      panels are ready to be dropped into place on their concrete      footings. This prefabrication, of course, opens up a whole      new world of possibilities to the prospective owner. For      the first time, someone with only "fair to middling".      construction skills can tackle-and successfully      complete-what would normally be a "professionals only" job.      Therefore -even if the concrete foundation work had to be      handled by a contractor- the owner could still save <em>20%      or more</em> of the total cost of construction ... by      simply assembling the home him- or herself. (Of course, the      use of heavy equipment is still necessary, but-since the      basic structure will be completed in one day rental costs      for such machinery can be kept to a minimum.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, the Solartron folks provide a fully detailed      set of instructions and blueprints with each design they      sell, and make themselves available <em>after</em> the sale      to help with any technical or construction problems that      the builder might run into during the course of an      installation.    </p>    <p>      Finish carpentry poses no problem either ... the fiberglass      component parts are designed so that inside walls, and door      and window openings, can be "dressed up" just as in any      conventional home ... the owner/builder has the option of      either paneling, painting, or plastering the interior      surfaces, and installing the hardware of his or her choice.    </p>    <h3>      AND THERE'S MORE TO COME!    </h3>    <p>      The Solartron people are busy setting up distributorships      that they hope will eventually serve all of the U.S., from      coast to coast. At the same time, though, they're working      on <em>new</em> designs ... which will not only supplements      their already comprehensive line of offerings but will also      give the Solartron houses an added dimension: "sun" heating      for 100% energy self-sufficiency! If all goes as planned,      Mr. Bullock will within two years-have solar capacity      incorporated into all the structures he sells.    </p>    <p>      Until then, though, the numerous other advantages of      Solartron's earthcovered shelters should be reason enough      to warrant a long, hard look at what Ralph Bul lock has to      offer ... you might just end up "goin' underground"      yourself!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If the idea of a nearly self-sufficient,      inexpensive, highly practical,</em> fiberglass      <em>earthsheltered home piques your interest, drop Ralph      Bullock a line at American Solartron Corporation, Dept.
