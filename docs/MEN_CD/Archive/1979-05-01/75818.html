                    <p>      <strong>YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN' IF YOU DON'T KNOW      WHERE YOU'VE BEEN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Turmoil in the Middle East. Predictions (threats?) of      dollar-a-gallon gasoline. Falling economic indicators      coupled with mushrooming inflation. Spot shortages of this      and that. Burgeoning surpluses of something else.      Oppressive levels of unemployment (among blacks in this      country, throughout Mexico and other "underdeveloped"      nations) alongside crying demands (in all parts of the      world) for trained workers.    </p>    <p>      Electrical brownouts and blackouts. Cutbacks in social and      other services. The bankruptcies of whole cities and      countries. Taxpayer revolts. "Voluntary" wage and price      "guidelines" that aren't so voluntary anymore. Mass      suicides and other outrages committed in the name of      religion. A paralyzing avalanche of govern. ment dictates,      mandates, rules, regulations, and other red tape. Calls for      a constitutional convention. Separatist movements and      terrorist acts and "wars of liberation" all over the globe.    </p>    <p>      Nuclear proliferation. A steadily increasing stream of more      and more deadly chemicals and wastes injected into the      planet's land, water, and air. Legionnaire's Disease in the      United States, "baby's disease" in Italy, and other new      regional epidemics that "don't respond to conventional      treatment".    </p>    <p>      An explosion in the incidence of cancer. A bewildering      quicksand of shifting political, economic, and ideological      alliances among nations. Earthquakes. Droughts. Record      winter blizzards. Floods. Confusion. Hysteria, in some      quarters. "Solutions" which only make the problems worse.    </p>    <p>      Why? Why, in this "enlightened" age, does nothing seem to      work as well "as it used to"? Why, despite our best      efforts, does the prosperity that we were so certain of 20      years ago ... daily slip through our fingers? Why do our      political, social, and economic institutions suddenly seem      dated, out of touch with reality, and ineffective? What is      happening to us, our country, and the planet? How much      worse will conditions have to get before they start to      improve? For that matter, can today's downward trends be      reversed? And it they can ... do we-as a nation, as a      culture, as the dominant species on earth-have enough      intelligence, wisdom, resolve, resources, and time at our      command to pull it off?    </p>    <p>      Well, the "leaders" (elected, self-proclaimed, or      otherwise) of our culture may not yet have gotten the word.      But, as reported five years ago in this magazine (see pages      12-17 of MOTHER NO. 32), a wise old man by the name of      Walter Prescott Webb had the answer to all those      questions-and many others-at least three      decades back.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, one particular book that Webb      published in 1952 The Great Frontier, available for      $6.95-plus 95 cents shipping and handling-from      Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28739) still stands as what has to be the single      most concise and penetrating review of Western history,      survey of current conditions, and forecast of the future      that any individual has ever set down on paper. Or, to put      it another way (as was done in MOTHER NO. 32), Webb was at      least 30 years ahead of his time. He had the answers in      1950 that most of us are just starting to grope for now. If      the world's politicians, economists, and captains of      industry had only listened to him <em>then</em> ... we      wouldn't be facing the mess we're all in today.    </p>    <p>      Webb's thesis, vastly compressed, is that Western Europe      was-from about 1300 to 1500-virtually static.      It had an area of approximately 3,750,000 square miles and      an estimated population of 100,000,000 people. And that was      it. Period. Decade after decade. The carrying capacity of      the day-to-day world known by the average inhabitant of      Western Europe had been reached.    </p>    <p>      "Progress" and "growth"-the concepts that modern      society values so highly-would have baffled medieval      Europe's typical citizen. There were very few entrepreneurs      back then because there was very little wealth to      manipulate. Opportunities for the accumulation of excess      capital, the investment of such funds, or the drawing of      interest on them were so sparse that public banking was      completely unknown and private banks were few, far between,      and used only by a handful of popes, monarch, and emperors.    </p>    <p>      For that matter, just staying alive was a major      accomplishment in Europe during the Middle Ages. The      continent's population was static because it had reached a      semi-starvation, subsistence balance on the land it      inhabited. There wasn't really enough food to go around.      Europe had reached its "limits of growth" and its citizens      lived in a mean, brutish, closed little world      Death-with Its possibility of Heaven offered most      inhabitants of the continent their only hope of escape.    </p>    <p>      And then-suddenly and within the merest eyeblink of      time as the planet measures its age-Europe was buried      in an absolute avalanche of riches. In a twinkling, the      land available to its people was increased five      <em>times</em> over by the "discovery" of and claims made      upon North America, South America, South Africa, Australia,      New Zealand, and hundreds of islands in oceans hardly known      before.    </p>    <p>      Thanks to the plundering of these new-to      them-lands, the amount of gold and silver handled by      the inhabitants of Europe was multiplied by a factor of 15      or more. The grains, fibers, timber, furs, base metals, and      many other material goods already known to Europeans poured      down upon them in a stream hundreds of times larger than      they had ever dared hope for. And exotic new foods and      trade goodssuch as chocolate, rubber, corn, pumpkins,      quinine, tobacco, potatoes, buffalo robes, and kangaroo      pelts-further surprised, delighted, and enriched them.    </p>    <p>      The boom was on! And it lasted-in round      numbers-from approximately 1500 to 1950. Four hundred      and fifty years. Four and a half centuries in which all the      inhabitants of the Western world-and especially those of us      lucky enough to live in one part or another of the Great      Frontier itself-were caught up in this overpowering      flash flood of new wealth and swept into a hitherto unknown      appreciation of the individual, self-motivation,      capitalism, and democracy.    </p>    <p>      It's rather difficult, you know, to develop a work ethic      when there's not enough work-or wages or even      food-to go around. It's extremely easy, on the other      hand, to "discover" the virtues of hard labor when-on      every side-you see people getting rich exactly in      proportion to the amount of work they invest in claiming      previously unclaimed land furs food, and seemingly      limitless quantities of other wealth.    </p>    <p>      Spread more land than can possiblly be farmed, more gold      than can be counted, more "work"-in the form of      grabbing a share of in apparently endless      bounty-before a group of people <em>(any</em> people,      even the wretched serfs and debtors who were-in large      measure-our ancestors) and you'll find that all our      most cherished concepts-"freedom", "independence",      "individualism", "selfreliance", "courage", "Initiative",      "Invention", and "industry"-practically discover      themselves.    </p>    <p>      Ah! If it only could have gone on forever ... instead of      just long enough (450 years) to make us <em>think</em> that      such a one-time explosion of windfall wealth is the natural      way of the world. Which, of course, it is not. As Webb's      book points out, the flood of "found" riches has now      crested. The tidal wave which picked to up and washed us to      our high-water mark-our elevated, in every sense of the      word, "standard of living"-is receding,    </p>    <p>      There's no more free land for tens of millions of pioneers      to homestead, no more buffalo herds to slaughter, no more      50-pound nuggets of copper lying on the ground in Michigan,      no more unclaimed wealth in North America, South America,      Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa. The Great      Frontier, for all practical purposes, has been completely      mapped and tapped.    </p>    <p>      It is also to Webb's everlasting credit that he could see      through the "answer" to this dilemma-the myth that      "technology will create a new frontier"-a full 30      years ago.    </p>    <p>      "Only newly found land and riches," said Webb, "can add to      the sum total of things in the absolute. Technology can do      nothing but change the form of what is already there.      Certainly the skill with which science has performed this      function has misled us into the assumption that science can      contribute to mankind unlimited benefits without regard for      substance. But this is a false assumption and appears as      such when we look at the whole picture."    </p>    <p>      Or, to put it another way: Long before the failure of the      highly touted "Green Revolution" . . . long before massive      oil spills, leaking vats of nuclear waste, and the pop-top      beer can ... long before smog, pesticides, industrial      contamination and other pollutants began killing tens of      thousands of people annually ... Walter Prescott Webb      realized that science actually creates nothing. It only      accelerates the destruction of what is already there.    </p>    <p>      "Which would you rather have," Webb asked, "the earth as it      was in 1500-before the Age of Science-with its      natural forests, clear streams, virgin soils, and precious      metals intact? Or the earth as it is now ... covered with      stumps, foul streams, eroded soils, and left with a      depleted store of precious metals? Technology has given us      the luxuries and comforts in a riotous holiday in which we      can eat and breed, but all the time it is sawing off the      limb on which it complacently sits, on which civilization      rests."    </p>    <p>      Nor was Webb misled by the "there's always more where that      came from" philosophy which dominated the world's energy      industries throughout the late 1940's and early 1950's. The      Great Frontier pointedly quoted M. King Hubbert-then      Associate Director of the Shell Oil Company who was, by the      end of the '40's, already predicting that U.S. petroleum      production would peak (exactly as it did!) in the late      1960's. The book also quoted Hubbert's appeal for the      stabilization of population and a switch to solar, wind,      and water power. "Otherwise," said Hubbert, "we'll suffer a      debacle" . . . which is precisely what today's "energy      crunch" now threatens to turn into.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, noted Webb (and, again, remember ... this      was 30 years ago), that "debacle" may well be only the      beginning of the end for what we've come to consider as our      natural way of life. "The years ahead," he said, "will be      far different from anything we've known. Even <em>if</em>      science makes some sort <em>of</em> dramatic      breakthrough"-which Webb strongly doubted was      possible-"the boom which will result will      <em>not</em> be the kind of boom we've had for 450 years.      At best, a great number of our most cherished institutions,      myths, and ways of doing business will have to be      discarded. At best, we must prepare for cataclysmic changes      in the way we live. At best, our future will be one of      upheaval."    </p>    <h3>      And at worst?    </h3>    <p>      Walter Prescott Webb was too gentle a man to go into all      the gory details of the wars and famines and disease that      his predictions imply ... but he did sketch out a loose      forecast of what a boomless future might hold in store.      Society-he said-will go through a process of      "devolution and retrogression rather than evolution and      progress". Rural life will become more important and the      cities will become less pleasant places in which to live.      Population will stabilize-too late, of course, and      for the wrong reasons-and society will take on some      of the steady-state characteristics of the medieval age.    </p>    <p>      The democracy of the frontier will give way to socialism      and fascism. Governments will become stronger and      individuals less important. Capitalism will decline and      prosperity will slip from the grasp of England, Europe,      and-finally-the Americas.    </p>    <p>      As population expands toward its final balance with the      land ... food and clothing and other basics of life will      become relatively more and more costly. As a result, we'll      soon give up our efforts-in name, as well as      fact-to feed the planet's hungry, defend the "free"      world, and prop up the economy of every nation that sides      with us.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, if we're lucky enough to reach a stand-off      which offers enough stability for reflection, Webb feels      that the historians and philosophers of the future will      "view the Age of the Frontier as an aberration, a temporary      departure from the normal, a strange historical detour in      which men developed all sorts of quaint ideas about      property for all, freedom for all, and continuous      progress". The institutions that we now take for granted,      Webb thinks, will appear "to have been so highly      specialized that they could not survive the return of      society to a normal state where there was a balance between      land and the man who lived on it.    </p>    <p>      It is, indeed, unfortunate for us all that few-if      any!-of the politicians and economists now "leading"      the Western world have read Walter Prescott Webb's book,      The Great Frontier. If they <em>had read</em> the book, of      course, they would understand that the 450-year-long      prosperity which our society has enjoyed and which began to      draw to a close around 1950 was entirely due to the      windfall riches of North America, South America, etc. that      we've been plundering for the past four and a half      centuries. They would also knowas they now do      not-that the same prosperity has in no way been      created by the manipulation of interest rates, the      establishment of social security systems and welfare      programs, or any other shuffling of economic theories,      political platforms, or social schemes.    </p>    <p>      Or, to state the case somewhat differently: As we all know,      there are-on a few remote islands in the South      Pacific-some isolated tribes that were completely      overwhelmed by the sheer wealth our armed forces dumped on      their shores during World War II. They had no idea where      that wealth came from or how it was collected, processed,      and transported. They only knew that-suddenly, one      day-tons of C-rations and jeeps and Quonset huts and      gasoline and chocolate bars came in across the ocean and      down out of the skies and landed on their islands.    </p>    <p>      Well, those folks liked that wealth and they never quite      figured out why-once the war was over-it      stopped being delivered to their doorsteps. And now, every      once in a while, members of those tribes build elaborate      replicas of the landing craft and the cargo planes that      once brought all those riches to them. And they hold      ceremonies, and they promise their gods that they'll be      good if only that Magic Spigot in The Sky is turned on once      again.    </p>    <p>      And that's exactly the way most of the so-called      leaders of the "civilized" nations are operating today. We      were all poor once but-suddenly, one day-we got      rich. And we stayed rich for 450 years. And then we all      started to get poor again. And none of our politicians or      economists seem quite able to figure out why the Magic      Spigot is running dry.    </p>    <p>      And so, just like those "simple" natives out there in the      South Pacific, our politicians and economists are now      resorting to ceremonies, incantations, and other forms of      magic. Maybe-they hope-if they put just the      right name on a new financial theory and fiddl e with the      discount rate or insure bank deposits or create investment      tax credits just so ... well maybe, just maybe, the Good      Times will roll once again.    </p>    <p>      Lots of luck. Until and unless another unmapped and      untapped planet swings so closely into orbit with the earth      that we can build a bridge across and strat plundering      virgin territory once more, those Good Times are gone for      good. And all our quaint social, economic, and political      theories with them.    </p>    <p>      Which leaves us with ... more of the long, slow slide that      all of our institutions have been struggling with since at      least 1966 (the year in which, in real terms, the U.S.      stock market peaked).    </p>    <p>      From now on-for as long as you, your children, and      your children's children live-we can expect the      overall quality of life, as we've come to know it to do      nothing but decline. There will, of course, be ups and      downs along the way ... but in general each and every year      from now on will be a little worse than the one before.    </p>    <p>      There will be less and less food to go around. Fewer      clothes and material goods of every kind. We'll all be      increasingly crowded. Less important as individuals.      Average life spans will decrease. Every kind of crime and      every form of insanity will increase. There will be more      government by decree, by default, by <em>coup      d'état</em> ... and less by democratic action.      Terrorist activities will become far more desperate, far      more violent, much wider spread, much more random, and      increasingly directed against totally innocent bystanders.    </p>    <p>      It's only a matter of time until we have genuine worldwide      famines and pestilence ... both by accident and as the      result of calculated political action. Both runaway      "peaceful" nuclear devices and intentionally detonated      atomic weapons will kill millions of people and contaminate      hundreds of thousands of square miles. Interestingly      enough-perhaps by coincidence, perhaps because of      larger reaso ns we don't fully comprehend-the      incidence of "natural" disasters such as tornadoes,      hurricanes, earthquakes, and hordes of insect pests will      probably increase right along with the increase in      man-originated catastrophes.    </p>    <p>      Economically, there will be more-and more      violent-swings in the price of commodities. The stock      markets of the world will increasingly be run up and down      by rumors, privileged information, and pure caprice.      Inflation of every possible intensity will sweep the world,      as will large and small recessions and depressions ... and      purely chance mixtures and combinations of simultaneous      inflation and depression.    </p>    <p>      Expect more wars, both great and small. More nationalist      movements. More attempts to secede from old political and      geographical organizations. More demands for "action". More      protests. More neighborhood squabbles. More Saturday night      knifing More child abuse.    </p>    <p>      Nothing will run as well as it "used to". There will be      more power brownouts and blackouts. Telephone service will      deteriorate. Roads fall apart. Institutions crumble and      lose meaning. Many of the physical, social, and economic      interconnections that hold industrial society together will      be severed. Lawlessness will prevail and some people will      "fight back" by joining gangs that use any means necessary      to guarantee their members some security and the      necessities of life. Others will try to exist on what's      left over. Still others will simply give up and withdraw      into catatonic stupors.    </p>    <p>      That, of course, is just the general trend: a long, slow,      downhill slide. The good news is that there will be a few      temporary "reprieves" and momentary "gains" along the way.      The bad news is that at any given time there will always      exist an increasingly great chance for an unexpected savage      catastrophe of truly terrifying size, shape, and hue.    </p>    <p>      If this all sounds familiar ... well, that's only because      the paragraphs you've just read were excerpted-almost      thought for thought-from pages 12-17 of MOTHER NO.      32, a magazine that is now more than five years old. We're      no happier than you are that-day by day over the past      half decade-all the distasteful predictions laid down      in that issue of this publication have done nothing but      come true.    </p>    <p>      Yes, as Lewis Mumford stated in the summer of 1974, "The      new Dark Age is already here. We just don't know it."      Conditions really are that bad ... and-from muggings      in school hallways to corruption in high places to nations      snarling over dwindling world resources-getting worse      on a daily basis.    </p>    <p>      But be of good cheer. Unlike our "leaders", you-as a      reader of this magazine-at least have a broad view of      what is going on. And remember Western society has already      successfully survived another great Dark Age. How? By      amassing its useful arts and crafts and skills and books      and knowledge in small, decentralized, self-contained,      defendable, agrarian communities (they were called      "monasteries" and "walled cities", as you'll recall).    </p>    <p>      Perhaps we'll all be forced to take such drastic steps      again. Perhaps no. Whether we do or not, however, it's a      safe bet that you and your family can face the trials ahead      much more comfortably if you start-right      now!-stocking up on <em>real wealth:</em> A little      piece of land that you can grow your food on, a passively      solarheated earth-sheltered home, how-to books and      do-it-yourself skills, barterable goods, and all the other      things that this column regularly recommends. It's always      better to be ten years too early in a case like this ...      than one day too late.    </p>
