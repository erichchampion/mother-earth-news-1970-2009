    <p>
                <p>      <strong>You can save a good deal of money?and find a lot of      satisfaction-if you learn</strong> ...    </p>                                <p>      In my village in the French Alps-as well as in many      other parts of the world-hay is stil harvested by      hand ... and there are two good reasons why this ancient      skill has survived. For one thing, our meadows-on      steep, terraced slopes-an accessible only by      footpaths, so the use of machines is just about out of the      question. In addition, the folks who live in this Alpine      town are. mostly small landholders, who don't require      enormous quantities of feed for their livestock.    </p>    <p>      Of course, it's very possible that your homestead doesn't      spread over hundreds of acres either, and-even if      your land is flat enough to accommodate a motorized mower      and baler-you might not have sufficient grass to      justify the purchase or rental of haying machines. In such      a ease, it could be worth your while to take up a scythe      and learn one of man's oldest agricultural arts.    </p>    <p>      Haying by hand can be terrible drudgery ... or-with      only the swish of the scythe through perfumed grass to      break the silence of an early, sunny morning-it can      be one of the sweetest pleasures of farm life. But, if you      hope to find poetry in the fields-intead of back      pain-you must collect the right tools . . keep them      in top condition ... and use them correctly.    </p>    <h3>      MAKIN' HAY    </h3>    <p>      You can expect a cow to eat about 35 pounds of hay a day      during cold weather. Horses will require almost 44 pounds      apiece, while sheep and goats can get by on 4-1/2 pounds of      fodder daily. So, if you multiply your animals'      requirements by the number of days that you might have to      keep them enclosed, you'll be able to estimate your total      hay needs.    </p>    <p>      Different types of land, of course. give different grass      yields. It takes my household (two people) six weeks to      bring in 6.4 tons from our five acres (sometimes with a      little help from friends). We work full eight-hour      days-including weekends-and only take a break      when it rains. (Ask neighboring farmers what you can expect      from,your fields, and-if you can count on the labor      of two regular workers-allow a month or I more to      harvest enough hay for one cow.)    </p>    <p>      Most folks reap their grass when it's reached peak growth      (just before flowering) in order to get maximum yields.      However, sirice young plants are higher in food value, some      French farmers cut before the peak ... then harvest a      second cutting later. By mowing twice, these people make      nearly normal yields <em>and</em> get superfine fodder.    </p>    <p>      In our village, however, we have a short growing      season-May to September-so we only cut once ...      usually in about mid-July, when the grass is "high as an      ass's eye". After the harvest, we let the pasture grow      again, and-in the autumn-put our two cows out      to graze on the second growth.    </p>    <p>      Don't fret if you can't mow precisely at the "right time",      however. If you're delayed, it won't make a huge difference      in the feed's nutritional value. But, whether your fields      are wild or cultivated, diversity of plants is important.      Good provender should contain several species of both      grasses and legumes (such as clover, alfalfa, and vetch) if      it's to provide your animals with well-balanced meals.    </p>    <h3>      SCYTHE SELECTION AND USE    </h3>    <p>      To "cut your own", you'll need a good scythe with a blade      made of strong, easy-to-sharpen forged steel. The ban dle      (this can be either metal or wood) should include an      adjustable bolt fastening that allows you to regulate the      blade's angle.    </p>    <p>      Scythe experts use light, razor-thin blades, but these are      easily broken on hidden rocks when used by the uninitiated.      Y ou'll do better to buy a sturdier tool to withstand the      knocks that you, as a beginner, will give it. After a few      years of haymaking, you can safely use the thinner types.      you can be sure of your tool's quality-whatever kind      of scythe you buy-if you make a simple resonance      test: Just thump the blade's surface with your finger. and      if it rings clear ... it's fine. A dull thud, on the other,      hand, is a good enough reason to look elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      A person's height is used to determine the length of his or      her -mower's- handle. Stand the scythe (with the blade      attached) at your side. The upper grip should come just to      your armpit, and-with your arm hanging naturally at      your side-you should be able to grasp the lower grip with      your hand. Strength is the determining factor in choosing a      blade length. Tile men of outvillage usually use a 26- to      30-inch model, while women and children are more      comfortable-and efficient-with the lighter      24-inchers.    </p>    <p>      Once you've chosen your, scythe, practice with it: Grab the      lower grip with your right hand, palm down, and the upper      grip with your left hand, palm up. Then, stand with your      legs apart to balance the swing and concentrate on a whole      body pivot-knees bending to accommodate to the      sway-and shift your body from right to left and back.      (Wrist and arm movements are secondary to this "body      English".)    </p>    <p>      Keep the blade as nearly <em>parallel to the ground</em> as      possible, and swing it from right to left to make the cut      (or swath) of grass. The cutting edge should slice into a      patch of grass at an acute angle, similar to the way a      carving knife slices into a hunk of meat.    </p>    <p>      Cut four inches or less into the grass with each sweep and      swing the blade only as widely as is comfortable for you.      As you return the scythe to the right, the grass will slip      off in a neat row to your left. Should you find that you      lean too far over-or too far back-in an effort      to keep the blade ''flat'' ... simply adjust its angle.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, when you come to unyielding      obstacles-rocks or branches-either moderate      your swing, work around the hazards, or avoid that spot      altogether. And <em>never force</em> the blade to cut woody      vegetation ... the swing of the scythe should provide the      power for your cut.    </p>    <h3>      KEEP IT SHARP!    </h3>    <p>      Blade sharpening is a ritual with the old-timers in our      village. After several rows of grass, these ''pros" sharpen      their scythes' cutting edges with a stone, and-every      hour or so-stop to beat them on a special anvil. The      regularity of such "touch-ups" should give you some idea of      how important a <em>sharp</em> scythe is ... so take a few      extra minutes to hone your blade correctly. If you don't do      this, you'll waste time and energy chopping furiously and      unsuccessfully at stubborn patches of grass.    </p>        <p>      The traditional scythe anvil (see Fig. 1 that accompanies      this article) has a slightly rounded head (not the flatiron      type) and is used with a ballpeen hammer. To employ this      tool, simply drive its pointed end into the earth, lay the      scythe blade on the rounded head of the anvil, hold the      concave side of the ''knife" away from you with one hand      and hammer with the other. Then-working in small      areas from the wide end of the blade to the      point-beat gently (always <em>striking away from</em>      you and at an angle) along the cutting edge. The idea is to      stretch the metal outward until it's thin and sharp and the      nicks are worked out. (If you hammer straight down on the      blade, its edge will ripple.)    </p>    <p>      You'll also need to carry a whetstone (an oblong one with      rounded ends) in a can of water. (Punch two holes in the      top of the can and strap it to your belt where you can get      to it easily.) Then, about every five yards-depending on      the thickness of the grass-sharpen your tool with the      whetstone and water. (Believe me, you'll welcome the      breather! ) Just upend the scythe and hold the blade steady      with one hand while you pass the stone over-and then      under-the cutting edge with the other. Always      <em>sharpen in the same</em> direction <em>... away front      you and front the wide end toward the point.</em>    </p>    <h3>      'ALL CUT AND DRIED"    </h3>    <p>      Get into the field as early in the morning as you can.      Scything is hot work, and insects can sting you to a fury      when the air warms up. Besides, if you reap early, you have      the remainder of the day to let the grass dry.    </p>    <p>      You'll be scything from right to left, so-on a flat      field-always begin your cut at any corner and      continue along the side to your left. On a slope, it's best      to follow the path of least resistance: Begin your cut at      the highest corner, and work down.    </p>    <p>      After the grass is mowed, it should be spread out to dry as      soon as possible. Get your helper to follow you into We      field with a pitchfork (the three-pronged variety is best)      and breakfast. He or she can fluf up and spread the fodder      while you take a break.    </p>    <p>      The drying time required for your hay will depend on the      thickness of the grass and on the weather. If you're      blessed (as we are) with lots of sun and and mountain air,      you can bring in your hay after two or three clear days      Just make sure it's thoroughly dry <em>on each side</em>      before you store it, as wet forage spoils and can make your      animal(s) sick. If rain falls on your crop, you must spread      it out again. Remember, too, that if complete <em>ly      dry</em> bay gets soaked, it will lose about half its food      value. However, if the forage grass is still green and      moist, a lit tle rain won't hurt it.    </p>    <p>      People who harvest a lot of hay have developed many      techniques to store it in the field. The commonest method,      of course, is to stack the fodder in inverted cones that      shed water quickly and keep the inner layers of hay dry.    </p>    <p>      To avoid this extra field work, we cut only a small area at      a time. When the big thunderclouds roll up, we quickly rake      the dry hay together and cover it with heavy plastic sheets      (about 5 by 15 yards), weight the corners and edges with      big stones, and run for the chalet before the down. pour.      If the sky is clear the next day, we uncover the      stack-to let it breathe-wait until the ground      is dry, and respread our crop.    </p>    <p>      If you want to cut a large amount at one time-or you      wish to store your cuttings in the field for lack A barn      space-try We haycock or tripod methods described in      <em>The Guide to SeIf-Sufficiency</em> by John Seymour      (Popular Mechanics Books, 1976). It's available in good      bookstores or can be ordered (for $11.95 plus 95 cents      shipping and handling) from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739.    </p>    <h3>      RAKE AN 0 BALE    </h3>        <p>      The traditional European hay rake-an efficient tool      that is handcrafted from wood-has been refined over      centuries of use. You'd do well to make yourself a few. All      that's necessary are some pieces of ash or spruce wood and      a few tools that you probably already own. (See the      accompanying sidebar for rakemaking details.)    </p>    <p>      Every corner of France has its traditional method of      handbaling, but our 70- to 90-pound bales-which can      be carried on a horse, wagon, wheelbarrow, or human      back-work well: To tie each bale, we use one 4-yard      and three 3-yard ropes ... all made of strong jute or      nylon. Each length has a toggle attached to one end ( see      FIG.2 ).    </p>    <p>      The hay is stacked up about shoulder high on top of the      ropes, then crushed down tight and tied up Ike it parcel ..      with three ropes around the width and the fourth tied      lengthwise (Fig. 1).    </p>    <p>      Another method is to pile a smaller quantity on a big      square of burlap or canvas, with straps it each corner      which are used to tic the hay in a bundle. (This is      especially useful to tote feed front the barn to the pens.)    </p>    <p>      To make one of these canvas carriers, hem a square of      material (about 54 by 54 inches) on all four sides to      prevent fraying, and sew on another layer of material at      the corners for reinforcement. Then, stitch a strap or rope      (about 1-1/2 feet in length) to each corner . . . with it      good four to five inches sewn to the fabric. (We use the      flat skips of meterial that hold venetian blinds for our      straps, as they seem to wear better than (to ropes. )    </p>    <p>      Then, when you want to bundle the hay, simply stack it on      the square and tie the corners together diagonally with it      bow knot. That way, when you get to the manger, you min get      the whole thing undone quickly ... animals can get mighty      impatient when they see supper nearby!    </p>    <p>      (Of course if you can haul the harvest to your storage area      with a pickup truck ... you can skip the baling job      altogether.)    </p>    <h3>      STORE IT!    </h3>    <p>      Get your crop to the barn its soon as you can, untie the      bales, and fluff the hay with a pitchfork to break up the      compressed grass. ( Plenty of ventilation helps prevent      fermentation.) If You discover some fodder that's still      slightly damp, sprinkle, salt between several of its      layers. This will discourage spoilage and give your animals      part of their salt requirement.    </p>    <p>      Once the harvest is in, store your equipment in it dry      place until the next summer. At your leisure, replace any      broken teeth in the hay rake, repair ropes, and make more      toggles (which can come in handy for a variety of jobs ).    </p>    <p>      Then you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the winter ...      knowing your animals are warm and well nourished on the      pure, homegrown grass you've provided. And knowing, too,      that you did the job without burning an ounce of gasoline,      or sending a single puff of smoke into the sky.    </p>		<hr />        <p>      There's really no comparison between the common      massproduced garden rake and the specialized haying tools      used in Europe. French farmers handcraft these fine      implements from three kinds of hardwood: hazelnut for the      handle, aspen or ash for the head, and ash or rowan for the      teeth. If ,necessary, you can use all ash, or-if      that's not available-spruce, which is also strong and      flexible, will do.    </p>    <p>      To begin, select the wood for your handle., Try to find a      hazelnut sapling 8' to 10" taller than you are and about 2"      in diameter. Fix the pole in a vise, and smooth off the      bark and rough edges with a draw knife. (When it's      finished, the staff should be about 8" taller than you are      ... and 1-1/2" in diameter.)    </p>    <p>      Next, use a saw to make a 17" cut down the center of one      end of the handle and-with a      pocketknife-whittle these two ends into a pair of      3/4"-diameter circular prongs. Then, two or three strands      of wire around the base of the Y- cut, and twist the ends      tightly together (with a pair of pliers) .to prevent      further splitting.    </p>    <p>      For the rake's head use a 1" X 2" X 28" piece of ash. Fix      the board in a vise-with the 2" side up-and drill two holes      along the center line, one 12-1/2" from each end of the      lank. Ma ke the bores just under 3/4" in diameter, and go      clear through to the other side so the handle's prongs can      be wedged in tightly    </p>    <p>      To make 30 teeth, you'll need three ash boards (each 1" X      30"). Begin by fixing a board vertically in the vise and      carefully splitting it down the      middle-lengthwise-with a hammer and hatchet.      Then saw each half into five equal segments of 6 inches      each, which you leave you with ten 1" X 1" X 6" square      pegs.    </p>    <p>      Cut the other two boards the same way. Then get      ,comfortable and whittle the pegs into round teeth with      your pocketknife. As you carve them down (to 3/8" in      diameter and 5" long) try to curve each tine slightly.      (Teeth curved in direction of the pull make for a stronger      and more efficie nt rake.)<br />      <br />      Now, hammer the teeth into 5/16"-diameter holes predrilled      into angle slightly toward the handle-through one of      the 1" surfaces of the head ... tapping them until they're      flush with the opposite edge. (Make sure all the curves      point in the same direction.) As double insurance that      teeth are solidly fixed secure each one in place with a      3/4" nail on the handle side of the head Each brad should      protrude slightly, so that you can remove it if a tooth      breaks and has to be replaced.    </p>    <p>      Finally, put the handle in the vise and match up the 'two      center holes of the rake's head with the prongs. Hammer      them together until the prongs, too, are flush with the      other .side and fasten the fork in place with two 1" nails      . .. pounded in at an angle from the top of the head. Again      , let the fasteners protrude a little for easy removal.    </p>    <p>      Sure, makin' your own rake involves a little work,      but-When you're out rakin' hay-you'll find it      was darn well worth it!    </p>
