                    <p>      <strong>For backpacking and camping - or just an      easily prepared, delicious meal - try...</strong>    </p>        <h3>      SANDRA KOCHER    </h3>        <p>      About nine years ago, a college student named Craig      Bumgarner stopped along the Vermont section of the      Appalachian Trail, whipped up a tasty casserole, and shared      the meal with veteran hiker Edward B. Garvey. Ed, who had      already walked the many miles of the Trail from Georgia,      was on his way to Maine. Later-when Mr. Garvey      described his more-than-2,000-mile trek in the book      <strong>Appalachian Hiker</strong> (Appalachian Books, 197      1. $4.95)-he wrote enthusiastically about Craig's      delicious, protein-balanced combination of two grains      and one legume ... and backpackers all over the country      began experimenting with variations on that original      recipe!    </p>    <h3>      THE BASIC MIX    </h3>    <p>      To prepare this lightweight, nutritious dish, you'll need 2      cups of brown rice (short or long grain), 1 cup of barley,      1 cup of lentils, and 4 teaspoons of salt. Then, add 2      parts water to 1 part Mix ... bring it to a boil for 1      minute ... reduce the heat ... and      simmer-covered-for 40 to 60 minutes. (You can      cut the cooking time if you precrack your grain ingredients      in a grinder or a blender.) One cup of the dry mixture      (which can be packed in individual-serving-sized plastic      bags before you hit the trail) will-once      cooked-satisfy two very hungry hikers .. . or three      or four less active people.    </p>        <p>      And, although the basic Mix is scrumptious, other      ingredients can be substituted or added ... when you're in      the mood for a change or just want to cook up a special      treat. I've tried a number of variations on the recipe over      the years and have come up with these three personal      favorites:    </p>    <h3>      HERBED TOMATO BLEND    </h3>    <p>      In a saucepan, bring 1 cup of Mix, 1 teaspoon of sweet      basil, 1 tablespoon of parsley, 1/4 teaspoon of oregano,      and 2-1/2 cups of tomato juice to a boil for 1 minute, and      then reduce the heat to low. Cook the mixture for about 50      minutes, stirring occasionally, andif desired-sprinkle      grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving. NOTE: The      proportions mentioned are for dried herbs. Triple the      quantities when these ingredients are used fresh.      <strong>MUSHROOM CURRY IN-THE-PINES</strong> Heat 1      tablespoon of butter (or vegetable oil) in a pot and stir      in 1 chopped onion (or 1 tablespoon of dried onion flakes)      and 1 teaspoon of curry powder. Next. add 2-1/4 cups of      water, 1 cup of Mix, and 1 package of dry mushroom soup (or      substitute 1 /2 cup of dried mushroom pieces and 1/2 cup of      milk powder). Stir the curry well, and bring it to a boil      for 1 minute. Then, reduce the heat (or place the pan over      a few glowing coals), add 1/2 cup of raisins, and let the      dish Yammer for about 50 minutes, stirring occasionally.      Finally, serve the spicy treat with peanuts, sunflower      seeds, and/or grated coconut.    </p>    <h3>      SYRIAN SALAD    </h3>    <p>      This is a variation on the popular Near Eastern salad      called tabouli, which is traditionally made with bulghur      and served with tender, young grape leaves.    </p>        <p>      First, cook 1 cup of Mix in 2 scant cups of water until the      ingredients are soft and all the liquid is absorbed (about      50 minutes). Then, pour it into another bowl or pot ... and      toss in 1/2 cup of fresh chopped parsley, 1/3 cup of diced      mint, 1/4 cup of chopped green onion, 1 or more tomatoes      cut in small pieces, 1/4 cup of olive or other vegetable      oil, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. (Dried parsley, mint, and      onions may be substituted for the fresh ingredients . . .      if you reduce the given amounts by 2 to 3 tablespoons      each.)    </p>        <p>      Toss the salad gently and chill, if possible. Then, serve      your backpacker's masterpiece with fresh lettuce leaves.      You'll find this dish makes a tasty sandwich filling, too      ... especially if it's served in pita bread.    </p>
