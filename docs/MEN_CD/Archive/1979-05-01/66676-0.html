        [1] Starting your own puppet troupe means ? first of all ? having a collection of the ""little folk"". These are two of my favorite hand puppets, but . . . [2] you may also want to procure several ""mouth"" puppets to add variety to your shows. [3] The stage should be attractive and colorful, and designed for easy assembly and disassembly. It should also be sized to your dimensions, so you'll be comfortable when you sit or stand inside it. [4] Don't try to memorize an entire play. Instead, attach your script to the wall just in front of you ... below the stage floor. Keep one eye on the script and the others on the characters. [5] Once you get your business down pat, you'll enjoy entertaining these young audiences ... and the children will be so enthralled they may think your ""actors"" are real! [6] After the show, the youthful viewers will be delighted by a chance to meet the ""cast"".
