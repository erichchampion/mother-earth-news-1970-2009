                		<hr />    <p>      If you now operate-or have ever operated-a successful home      business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and where-and      with how much "seed money"you started your venture. Because      if your story can be fitted into an upcoming installment of      BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES, you'll receive [1] the warm      satisfaction of knowing that you helped someone else find      the happiness you enjoy and [2] a free two-year new or      renewal subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Like most MOTHER-types, I've always had a strong desire to      be independent and self-sufficient ... and I'd been working      toward that goal by saving up to buy a piece of homestead      land. After looking over some of the Good Earth's price      tags, however, I came to the conclusion that my current      carpenter's wages wouldn't bring In enough cash to realize      my dreams ... so I began to look for just the right      part-time job.    </p>    <p>      My search ended when I came upon an article In MOTHER NO.      54 (page 86) entitled "Homestead Furniture: A 'Natural'      Moneymaker". After reading that piece, I took a swift      inventory of my garage store room: There I found a dozen or      so eight-toot pieces of rough cedar 2 X 4's ... some large      scraps of half-inch plywood ... a bit of ceramic floor tile      (left over from a remodeling job I'd done the summer      before) ... and a decent supply of glue, nails, and grout.      With these materials-plus some lag screws and flat washers      I bought for a grand investment of $3.56-I'd soon put      together an 18' X 2' X 4' rough cedar table, with a ceramic      tile top, in a total of four short hours! The ceramic      covering was a big bonus, I thought, since It provided an      inexpensive, scratch-and water-resistant surface ...      and-at the same time-eliminated the time      consuming"finishing" process normally required in furniture      making.    </p>    <p>      No sooner had I completed my masterpiece than a friend      stopped by, admired my work, and offered me a deal: $25 in      clash plus No bucket seats to replace the dilapidated bench      I'd been suffering upon in my van. I promptly invested in a      now supply of ceramic tile ... and went to work-once      again-on my table making. Before I'd finished my second      attempt at the art, I'd presold three more tables ... for a      total of $135. That worked out to a $75 profit for      approximately 12 hours of enjoyable work ... or $6.25 per      hour! My home business has been going "great guns" ever      since ... and needless to say, I am one thankful MOTHER      reader!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Joseph R. Hunka<br />      Houston, Tex.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'd been searching for a long time for that one bootstrap      business that would fit my lifestyle. I wanted to work what      I call "hobby hours"approximately half of a regular      workday-and after researching MOTHER's many back      issues, I found just what I'd been seeking. MOTHER NO. 50      featured an article (on page 118) entitled "How to Earn      $500 a Month Recycling Metals". A few short days after I'd      read that piece, I found myself In business ... with a      total initial Investment of one tankful of gas!    </p>    <p>      My first week on the job was pretty rough going, because I      really didn't know what to look for or where to look for      it. However, I kept referring to MOTHER's article ... and      before long I began to get the hang of my new trade. Soon I      was specializing in nonferrous metals (such as copper,      brass, lead, and aluminum) ... since my hauling vehicle was      a car rather than a heavy-duty pickup truck. (Nonferrous      metals sell for an average of 20 cents to 50 cents per      pound, in contrast to their ferrous counterparts ... which      usually pay only about 2 cents per pound. It would take a      few thousand pounds of Iron scrap to equal the profits I      can make hauling several <em>hundred pounds</em> of the      lightweight materials.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, I learned to scan hillsides ... follow      clean-up and pick-up routes ... and frequent garages,      filling stations and dumping locations In my searches. In      no time I was averaging $10 to $12 per hour ($14 to $16      during the warmer weather) and on several occasions I've      pulled In as much as $50 per hour!    </p>    <p>      In the summers my nine-year-old son accompanies me on my      excursions ... and helps me to detect metals with his      trusty magnet. (My rule of thumb: If it doesn't stick to      the magnet, grab it and throw it into the trunk.)    </p>    <p>      One of the nicest things about my bootstrap business is      that the entire family can take part in it. But even better      still, it's an inflation-proof operation. The price of      scrap metal just keeps on rising!    </p>    <p>      <strong>L. Eugene Humphrey<br />      Pittsburgh, Pa.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'm a Navy man with five years left to go before my      retirement. . . and I've been planning for those "years of      leisure" with dreams of buying a small farm in Tennessee.      As a result, my wife and I decided that we should set up a      part time business to build a nest egg for our future ...      so we turned to MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Three articles helped pave the way toward our new      endeavor-"I Wash Windows ... and Live Like a King" and      "Clean Up With a Window Washing Business" in MOTHER NO. 40,      page 62 ... and "You Can 'Chan Up' as a Freelance      House-cleaner" in MOTHER NO. 47, page 46-as well as a      piece called "The House Painting Business" in THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted) Handbook of Home Business Ideas and Plans.      Those four write-ups were more than enough to put us to      work cleaning and repairing homes!    </p>    <p>      Our initial investment was only $35, to have business cards      and billing statements printed. Then we began      advertising-by distributing the cards to all the real      estate agencies, paint stores, hardware stores, and      lumberyards in our neighborhood-and two days later we      had our first job.    </p>    <p>      Our working tools-for both cleaning and      repairing-turned out to be many and varied ... but for the      most part they were implements that we (like most      do-it-yourselfers) already had on hand. We never bought a      special tool unless we'd already been commissioned to do a      job that required it ... and then, we would purchase the      device and charge it to "material" on the billing      statement.    </p>    <p>      It was necessary, of course, to come up with a fee schedule      for our clients ... and we decided to base the price for      our cleaning services upon the number of bedrooms in the      house. We charge $30, for example, to spruce up a two      bedroom dwelling. (Our service includes cleaning all the      appliances ... disinfecting tubs, showers, commodes, and      sinks ... washing dirty walls and woodwork ... and      sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping the floors.) We charge an      additional $35 to wash all of the home's windows-inside and      out-$10 for mowing lawns, and $10 to haul away trash      that can't be handled by the regular garbageman. Our      interior painting fee is generally $40 per room ...      while-on exterior jobs-our rule of thumb is 40  cents per      square foot of living space (a house that is 50 by 30 feet,      for example, has 1,500 square feet of living space ... and      will earn us $600!). We charge a minimum of $5.00 per hour      for repairs (plus materials) on an, job-so far our      fix it work has And the majority of as included replacing      broken windowpanes, building new screens or rescreening old      ones, hanging doors, and patching holes.    </p>    <p>      We've found that we can stay as busy as we like with our      new business. And since we began our part-time      endeavor-some nine months back-the two of us have netted a      total of $2,000 ... above and beyond the added benefits of      tools left over from special jobs, and furniture and      bric-a-brac that have either been abandoned In houses by      tenants who've moved out or thrown away by current      occupants.    </p>    <p>      All in all, our bootstrap business has been the perfect      moneymaker for us . . . the market is limitless, and the      experience itself has been a valuable reward!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dennis Frank Burkett<br />      Jacksonville, Fla.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Last year-after I was discharged from the Air      Force-I moved from California to Ormond Beach,      Florida with my pregnant wife and six year-old son. We      planned to wait out the winter "down South" before      returning to our home state of Indiana ... and I'd decided      to enter school part time during the cold months. Finances,      therefore, were bound to be tight, so I began to research      various moneymaking ventures. And, as luck would have it, I      came across two articles in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>' Handbook      of Home Business Ideas and Plans: Clarence Sockwell's "My      Paperback Book Exchange" and Paul Encimer's "Used Books Can      Give You a New Life".    </p>    <p>      As I mulled over the idea of running a book exchange, I      opened the yellow pages to check out my potential      competition ... and-to my surprise-there was      not one used bookstore in all of Ormond Beach. With that,      my mind was made up ... I would open the "Ormond Book      Exchange''.    </p>    <p>      My first step was to call upon my small $1,000 savings      account as collateral on a loan for an equal amount of      cash. In this way, I reasoned, making loan payments each      month would be a form of forced saving ... and, after I'd      repaid the money, my $1,000 would be there to use all over      again.    </p>    <p>      Next came the search for appropriate bookstore housing.      After a good deal of checking around, I located what I'd      been looking for a 900-square-foot building that rented for      $200 a month. Using my borrowed "seed money", I furnished      my place of business with $150 worth of fixtures, procured      from an old book dealer ... $300 in paperback/hard -cover      inventory, gathered here and there around town as the      result of a small classified ad . . . and a variety of      homemade store signs. My final Investment went toward the      purchase of city, county, and state permits ... a set of      business cards printed as bookmarks ... and a little local      advertising.    </p>    <p>      In four short weeks my project had gone from the idea stage      to an open bookstore: I was finally in business for myself!      In the first month, my bookstore pulled in $293 ...      and-in eight weeks more-both my gross and my      Inventory had nearly doubled! I was in my glory ... but,      alas, winter had ended and it was time to move on to      Indiana as my wife and I had planned. So we sold our little      enterprise to a local business broker for a whopping total      of $5,000!    </p>    <p>      In Indiana at last, my family was able to make use of its      bookstore profits to purchase four wooded homestead acres.      I've taken a job working for someone else now. But pretty      soon I expect to have some "seed money" built up once again      ... and when I do, MOTHER's sure to have another business      opportunity awaiting me.    </p>    <p>      Who knows ... the next time you hear from me I could be      cookin' up a homemade breakfast from my newly opened health      food restaurant!    </p>    <p>      <strong>John D.
