                    <h5 id="byline">      by ANNE AND PAUL EHRLICH    </h5>            <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Siences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to the      words "population", "resources", and "environment" in the      late 1960's. (They also coined the term coevolution, and      did a lot to make ecology the household word it is today.)      But while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular      writing in the areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of      us-for instance-have read Paul's book The Population      Bomb)</em> <em>... far too few people have any idea of how      deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research      (research of the type that tends to be published only in      technical journals and college textbooks). That's why it      pleases us to be able to present-on a regular basis-the      following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      THE SNAIL DARTER AND US    </h2>    <p>      Many people seem to wonder whether ecologists have gone off      the deep end in the struggle to protect endangered species.      We are often asked, "Isn't it preposterous that the      existence of such an insignificant fish as the snail darter      should be allowed to stop a public works project like We      TVA's Tellico Dam ... a structure in which millions of      taxpayers' dollars have already been invested? "    </p>    <p>      Our answer is always the same: The Tellico Dam should have      been stopped dead in its tracks even if it <em>had      been</em> a very important and worthwhile project (which,      according to much testimony, it wasn't). In fact, even if      the TVA had followed the letter of the law-instead of      trying to evade existing legislation-the dam could not have      been allowed to destroy that one little species of fish.    </p>    <p>      As many of you are aware, the ecological systems of our      planet constitute a gigantic life-support apparatus that      must function smoothly if our civilization is to persist.      We mentioned a few of the "public service!' functions in      our column on the tropical forests (MOTHER NO. 53, page      110) ... but let us reiterate:    </p>    <p>      Ecosystems maintain the quality of the atmosphere, help to      stabilize weather, provide food from the sea, control the      vast majority of potential crop pests and carriers of human      disease, generate and maintain soils, recycle nutrients      essential to agriculture, and dispose of our wastes.      Perhaps even more important, however, such systems also      preserve a vast genetic "library" on which we can draw      for-among other things-new domestic plants and animals,      spices and medicines, organisms for scientific research,      antibiotics, and so on.    </p>    <p>      Now, if everything about the life-sup port apparatus were      understood, all would be well. We would be able to predict      the consequences of fiddling with any part of it, and-in      particular-to understand what would happen if any one      element were removed from the ecosystem.    </p>    <p>      We know that many, if not most, ecosystems are quite robust      ... that they will recover from various sorts of insults,      and even from the extinction of populations and whole      species! The fossil record reveals that the extinction of      populations and species has been a regular feature of the      evolutionary process on this planet for hundreds of      millions of years. And, in the past century, many      extinctions have been observed that have not-at least in      the <em>short</em> term-seemed to have major deleterious      effects on their respective ecosystems.    </p>    <p>      But this is not a valid reason to believe that <em>Homo      sapiens</em> needn't be concerned about endangered specks.      Human knowledge of the properties of specific      ecosystems-and ecological structures in general-is      extremely limited. Something can be said about their      general properties-such as the way energy flows      through them, or the manner in which materials cycle in      them-but very little is understood of the details of how      ecosystems function and, in particular, of the factors that      make them stable or unstable. Biologists are just beginning      to learn about the vast amount of variability present      within and between natural populations ... and the      significance of that variability is still in dispute. It's      not yet clear how much the coevolutionary interactions      between organisms in natural communities have led to      stability in these communities, nor do we know how often      such interactions may destabilize an ecosystem and lead to      dramatic changes in its structure.    </p>    <p>      Scientists have not failed to ponder these questions ...      it's just that the interactions of the many millions of      kinds of earth's organisms-with each other and with the      physical aspects of their environment-are extraordinarily      complex. Although <em>certain</em> principles of ecosystem      organization can be clearly perceived, ecologists are-in      most cases-not in a position to predict accurately      what will happen to a given system in the face of certain      kinds of disturbances ... such as the destruction of      populations.    </p>    <p>      There are weak analogies to this inability to forecast the      future in the complex realm of the social sciences. For      example, political scientists can tell you many things      about the organization of the United States government, but      they find it virtually impossible to foretell the precise      consequences of apparently minor disturbances such as the      Watergate break-in ... or even to forecast exactly the      results of elections (although these scientists are      fortunate enough to be able to ask individual people how      they're going to vote, whereas an ecologist can't ask a      snail darter what role it plays in the grander scheme of      things!).    </p>    <p>      It's often contended, however, that endangered species      shouldn't be allowed to stand in the way of "progress" . .      . simply because it's impossible to predict the      consequences of the destruction of such plants or animals.      For instance, Roger Starr (a member of the editorial board      of <em>The New York Times)</em> has argued that humanity      need not worry about driving populations of species to      extinction, since-as noted above- extinction has long been      a feature of evolution on this planet. Starr reasons that      if extinction didn't disrupt ecosystem functioning in the      past, it won't do so now. This superficially cogent      argument is utterly fallacious for two reasons:    </p>    <p>      First, the rate of extinction- because of habitat      destruction, poisoning, and exploitation-is vastly greater      today than the rates that have characterized most of the      billions of years of evolutionary history. For example, the      extinction rate for birds and mammals between 1630 and 1975      appears to have been 5 to 50 times as high as in the      distant past, and the rate over the next 20 years is      projected to be 40 to 400 times "normal".    </p>    <p>      This snowballing rate of extinction will no longer allow      the losses to be made up, as they formerly were, by      speciation (the evolutionary process that generates organic      diversity and develops new species). After all, even though      extinction is a natural process that has always accompanied      speciation, Homo <em>sapiens</em> inherited a species-rich      planet with fully functional ecosystems. Historically,      extinction was more than balanced by speciation.    </p>    <p>      Thus, the second reason that the no- need- to-worry- about-      extinction" argument is misleading has to do with the      future of speciation. Throughout geological time, the      splitting process of evolution has continually created new      kinds of organisms to be "tested" by the environment. It's      currently believed by most evolutionists that most      speciation occurs when populations isolated from one      another are subjected to very different environments and,      thus, to different selection pressures. (Natural selection      is simply the differential reproduction of genetic types,      or <em>genotypes</em> ... and the genotype best suited for      reproduction in one environment may not be the best in      another environment.)    </p>    <p>      Human intervention, however, usually seems to work      <em>against</em> the process of speciation. For example, it      seems likely that-in the next half - century- the rain      forests of South America will be reduced to a few scattered      preserves. If this happens, most of the larger organisms in      those limited areas will-in a relatively short time become      extinct as a result of natural population fluctuations. In      order to minimize this loss of species, attempts will      almost certainly be made to move animals from preserves      where they are abundant to other protected areas where      those species are scarce. However, this process of moving      organisms around-which has already begun with zoos      and nature-preserve breeding programs-reduces or      eliminates the isolation between the preserves ... and acts      against the speciation mechanism. Although speciation may      still be able to occur if selection pressures are strong      enough (and if the preserves are maintained for thousands      of years!), its rate will, at best, be greatly reduced.    </p>    <p>      And, in terms of a human time scale, the development of new      species has always been very slow ... slow enough that the      splitting of an evolutionary line of animals has not been      observed in the hundred-plus years since Darwin, although      <em>extinctions</em> have been numerous during that same      century.    </p>    <p>      So the snail darter, the Furbish lousewort, the mountain      gorilla, the blue whale, and all of the other endangered      species can be viewed as symbols of a much more general      impoverishment of earth's living biota. Beyond them,      hundreds of thousands of unsung species and -probably      equally important- millions of genetically distinct      populations have either gone extinct in the past few      decades or will do so in the next few.    </p>    <p>      As we indicated, it's not possible to predict the      consequences of-or even to observe-the vast majority of      these extinction events. But it is easy to predict their      eventual cumulative effect: the breakdown-first regional      and then global-of the all-important life-support functions      of natural ecosystems.    </p>    <p>      To make an analogy: Suppose you saw a group of people      prying rivets out of the wing of an airplane you were about      to board. Imagine, also, that you didn't know the exact      details of the airplane's construction, but were aware that      the loss of some rivets wouldn't <em>necessarily</em> cause      the wing to fail. Would this make you relaxed about the      prospect of flying in that airplane? Would you be satisfied      if you asked one of the people to stop prying out a rivet      and that person simply said, "You can't prove that the loss      of this rivet will fatally weaken the wing, so it's      perfectly all right for me to take it out"? Would you be      relieved if he said, "Don't worry ... see, I've just taken      out the rivet and the wing hasn't fallen off"?    </p>    <p>      You would, of course, have to be insane to fly in that      airplane after such a conversation. Needless to say, the      treatment of that imaginary wing bears considerable      resemblance to the present treatment of the life-support      systems of Spaceship Earth ... except that we have no      option as to whether or not we'll fly on her!    </p>    <p>      The organisms being exterminated are very much like the      rivets in the airplane's wing. It's virtually impossible to      prove that the removal of any one-or any group-will fatally      weaken the ecosystem. And the lack of catastrophic failure      immediately following the removal is no guarantee that      disintegration <em>won't</em> result in a later period of      stress.    </p>    <p>      Yet, the vast majority of Homo <em>sapiens</em> goes      merrily on its way ... popping off rivets without the      vaguest notion of the probable consequences of such      behavior. But we can, at least, be sure that those      consequences will not be pleasant. They can be expected to      include the collapse of fisheries, enormous pest outbreaks,      epidemics, the advance of deserts, erosion, the exhaustion      of freshwater sources, the progressive failure of highyield      agriculture and forestry, and climatic changes that may      induce catastrophic famines.    </p>    <p>      The avoidance of such events seems to be a powerful      argument for taking extreme precautions to prevent an      increase-or even a continuation-of current extinction      rates. Rather than exterminating other organisms more      rapidly, we should be searching hard for ways both to slow      that rate of loss <em>and</em> to ensure the continuation      of the speciation process at normal levels.    </p>    <p>      Of course, there are also compassionate and esthetic      arguments for protecting what are -as far as we know for      sure -the only other living beings in the universe. As the      great French anthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss, once      said: Any bug that is sprayed with pesticides is "an      irreplaceable marvel equal to the works of art which we      religiously preserve in museums". There is some hope that      we might persuade others of the esthetic value of such      organic diversity ... especially if they can be made more      intimately familiar with the beauty and complexity of      organisms. But the compassionate argument hinges upon such      things as upbringing, values, and emotions ... and those      adults who do not now accept this sort of reasoning are      unlikely to be converted. Therefore-as strong as esthetic      arguments may be to many people-we believe that the battle      to save organic diversity can only be won in today's      society on the most practical of grounds.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, it's against this backdrop that we take our      stand with the snail darter. True, the extermination of      this small fish alone will probably not precipitate an      ecosystem collapse. <em>But no more purposeful extinctions      by humanity can be permitted</em> ... <em>a firm line must      be drawn</em> NOW! Because, sooner or later, a Tellico Dam      or its equivalent will threaten <em>every</em> population      of nonhuman organisms on the face of this planet. Sooner or      later, each body of water will be needed as a source or a      sink for some human activity that will be lethal to its      natural occupants. Perhaps, indeed, every species will be      found to occupy a piece of land that could be plowed,      grazed, mined, logged, paved, or otherwise disrupted by      someone who sees a profit in it.    </p>    <p>      The hour has come for humanity to recognize that its fate      is inextricably tied up with the snail darters of our      planet ... to recognize that ever-increasing numbers of      human beings -each eternally trying to co-opt a larger      share of the earth's resources- endanger, not only the      other species of our planet, but humanity itself.    </p>
