            <p>      It's easier than you might think to add a truly personal      touch to any room in your house.<br />    </p>        <p>      PHOTOS BY THE AUTHOR    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Cathy Johnson    </h5>        <p>      Try to imagine a plain white room with an uncurtained      window centered on one of the walls. How dull! Now paint      that imagined window frame sky blue, stencil a green vine      to surround the window, and scatter blue morning glories      among the tendrils of the vine. Outstanding! Or, perhaps,      picture yellow daisies marching cheerfully across your      kitchen soffit . . . a border of coral seashells in your      bathroom . . . or a band of American Indian designs in      brown and brilliant turquoise above the chair rail in your      den. You might be surprised to learn that achieving such      effects with stencils, using an uncomplicated design with      just one or two colors, is easy. No artistic talent is      needed-just a careful touch with knife and brush, a      bit of practice, and patience.    </p>    <p>      After we finally finished restoring our 90-year-old      Victorian home, my husband and I found we had no funds left      for decorating. At first-after eight years of living      with dingy green wallpaper-the clean expanses of      freshly painted walls seemed heavenly. Soon, however, I      felt an urge to personalize those somewhat sterile      surfaces.    </p>    <p>      As I was looking through some pictures of Victorian rooms,      I remembered some stenciling I'd done. This technique, I      felt, would be a perfect way to add color and pattern to      our plain walls, and it would cost very little. I'd need      only to choose my designs and then spend a few dollars on      acrylic paint, a stencil brush, an X-Acto knife, and some      sheets of frosted plastic from which to cut stencils.    </p>    <h3>      A MATTER OF CHOICE    </h3>    <p>      I selected my designs with two criteria in mind: They      should be to scale in each room and should enhance the      Victorian character of the house.    </p>    <p>      If you decide to try stenciling, choose designs that suit      the style of your house and furnishings, and ones that      appeal to your own tastes. You may be able to find precut      patterns in hobby and craft shops, but be sure any such      design is large enough to show up well on your walls. I      bought several stencils, used tracing paper and colored      felt-tipped pens to reproduce each pattern three or      four times, then taped the papers up in various parts of      the room to see if they created the effect I wanted.    </p>    <p>      I found all my decorations in a book called <em>Authentic      Victorian Stencil Designs</em> (edited by Carol Belanger      Grafton, Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1982). Dover      offers a whole collection of books with heavy manila-paper      pages that can be cut out and used as stencils. Each book      has a different theme: Early American, American Indian, Art      Deco, Pennsylvania Dutch, and so forth.    </p>    <p>      (Of course, once you've had some experience stenciling, you      may want to create your own patterns. There are some      excellent books and also classes to help you do this.)    </p>    <p>      In a larger room, I like to use several designs, making      sure they're all compatible and that the colors either      match or harmonize. For example, when decorating my living      room I decided to use just one color for three patterns: a      small, regular repeat to add interest over windows and      doors, a more sweeping design to decorate the walls at      chair-rail height, and one large, dramatic half-medallion      to accentuate the arch between the living and dining rooms.    </p>    <p>      Once the stencils are decided upon, it's time to choose the      paint. If the surface to be decorated is varnished or      coated with an oil-based enamel, you'll need to use an      oil-based stencil paint. Otherwise I'd suggest buying      acrylic stencil paints because cleanup will be easierand      they smell better, too.    </p>    <h3>      CUT...    </h3>        <p>      You can purchase stencils that are ready to use, but if you      trace your designs from a book, you'll need to cut your      own. (The printed stencils in the Dover volumes also need      to be cut.) When tracing stencils, I use frosted stencil      plastic that comes in 9-inch by 12-inch sheets. If you're      painting with just one color, simply lay a plastic sheet      over your pattern and trace the whole design with a black      felt-tipped permanent marker (the plastic is      semitranslucent). Then place the tracing on a breadboard or      a piece of glass you don't mind scratching, and carefully      cut it out, using a new blade in your X-Acto knife.    </p>    <p>      Stencil patterns are made with bridges-that is, all      parts of the stencil are connected so it won't fall apart.      If you're tracing a design that wasn't meant specifically      for stenciling, you'll have to make your own bridges. (If,      when you're cutting, you should accidentally slice through      a bridge, you can easily repair it with transparent tape.)    </p>    <p>      If you plan to use more than one color, it'd be best to      make a separate stencil for each hue. In that case, to make      sure the design elements of all stencils always line up      correctly, make notches or registration marks at the same      spots on each one (two lining-up points are sufficient).    </p>    <h3>      MEASURE . . .    </h3>        <p>      Since you'll be using the same stencil over and over again,      it's important to mark some guidelines on the wall in order      to correctly place the stencil each time you move it. For      my continuously repeated pattern at chair-rail height, I      simply measured 36 inches up from the floor and marked that      point, at about 30-inch intervals, all around the room.      Then, using a yardstick, I connected all the marks with a      light pencil line. I also drew a line across the stencil      itself that could be matched to the guideline each time the      stencil was repositioned.    </p>    <p>      Turning corners-around a window frame, for      example-isn't difficult, especially since most border      stencils include matching corner designs. Just divide the      size of the stencil into the area to be covered, and use a      partial repeat, if necessary, to make the corners come out      where you want them.    </p>    <p>      When using a repeat pattern that isn't continuous,      determine the amount of space between each repeat by      figuring out how many times the whole design will fit into      the wall area you want to cover. With a little adjustment      of the blank spaces, you can avoid having to end up with a      partial design.    </p>    <h3>      AND PAINT    </h3>        <p>      When your stencils are cut and your guidelines marked,      assemble the rest of your materials. You'll need the paint,      of course, and a large, flat stencil brush, paper towels, a      disposable pie pan, and some masking tape. Fasten the      stencil to the wall, using a couple of pieces of tape, in a      spot that's appropriate for the design you've planned. (For      my 36-inch-high repeat around the room, I started as close      as possible to a corner. For a design that's centered over      a door or window, I'd probably start in the middle and work      outward on both sides.)    </p>    <p>      Pour a small dollop of paint into the pie pan (it takes      surprisingly little), and touch it lightly with the tips of      the brush's bristles. Then hold the brush as you would a      pencil, and pounce it on a clean part of the pan to      distribute the paint evenly through the bristles. (Pouncing      is a light, rapid tapping motion.) Pounce a few more times      on a paper towel, and you're ready to paint. (It's a good      idea to practice ahead of time, stenciling on newsprint or      brown wrapping paper.)    </p>    <p>      Press the stencil against the wall with the fingers of your      free hand, keeping them as close to the cutout design as      you can without interfering with your brushwork. Now,      pounce the brush against each cutout, tapping in a circular      motion from the edges inward. When the design is filled in      completely, carefully pull the stencil away from the wall      and reposition it. If the stencil has slipped or the paint      has crept under the edges, let the spot dry and then touch      it up with a bit of background color. (When using more than      one hue, finish the entire first-color design and then let      the paint dry before starting in again.) With a continuous      repeat, overlap the design by one element and be sure to      position the stencil along the penciled guideline.    </p>    <p>      When you come to the end of the wall or to a corner in the      room, you can usually adjust the overlap to make the      stencil end where the wall does. It's even possible to bend      a stencil for an inside or outside corner, but I've found      it easier (on me and on the stencil) to simply treat each      section of wall separately.    </p>    <p>      Once you try your hand at stenciling, you'll probably want      to experiment. After finishing the basic pattern in my      living room, I went on to stencil the metal baffle behind      our woodstove and also designed a medallion that      beautifully complements the ceiling fan. And in the      bathroom I used three colors to border the window and the      wainscot. Now I'm beginning to think about tackling the      kitchen. Let's see; maybe red cherries set among rosettes      of green leaves and . . .    </p>
