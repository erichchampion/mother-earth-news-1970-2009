                 <p><strong>BITS & PIECES</strong></p>    <h5 id="byline">BY Edward Stern</h5> 		    <p><strong>Congress denies protection to 240 endangered      species.</strong></p>    <p>      <em>It was originally enacted to protect popular American      animals like the bald eagle, the grizzly bear, and the blue      whale. But now, owing to a congressionally mandated      moratorium imposed in April of 1995, the Endangered Species      List has gone a record amount of time without a new species      listing. According to William Snape, legal director for the      Washington, D.C.- based environmental protection      group Defenders of Wildlife, the list is facing its own      extinction.</em>    </p>        <p>      "The Republican Congress wants to shut down the Endangered      Species program." Says Snape, "They don't want any new      species to come onto the list even if they deserve it."      Snape describes the method by which the 104th Congress      passed the moratorium as an act of legislative "trickery."    </p>    <p>      "What they did," says Snape, "was attach a completely      unrelated rider onto a $5 billion defense spending bill.      This technique is one that they have become quite masterful      at. They stick all these very nefarious and tricky riders      onto spending bills and budget bills that the president      sometimes is forced to sign because there are a lot of      other things riding upon it."    </p>    <p>      Since its implementation, the moratorium has prevented over      240 new species from being added to the Endangered Species      List. "At this point the listings program for the Fish and      Wildlife Service is entirely shut down," says Assistant      Director of Ecological Services Jamie Clark.    </p>        <p>      Some of the animals that are facing virtually assured      extinction are the jaguar (only a few Mexican populations      remain), the Atlantic salmon (only 120 returned to their      native rivers in Maine to spawn last year), the Florida      black bear (less than 1,500 remain), and the Quino      checkerspot butterfly (only six known populations are in      existence). All of these species were proposed for listing      by the Fish and Wildlife Service, but were denied because      of the moratorium. There have been over 100 plant species      proposed as well.    </p>    <p>      Ironically, this record-setting moratorium has taken place      during the administration of revered wildlife      conservationist Bruce Babbitt. Although some have      criticized the secretary of the interior for not working      harder to help lift the moratorium, Jamie Clark lauds      Babbitt's efforts: "Secretary Babbitt has worked during      this administration to insure an efficient implementation      of these agencies. He has worked to insure that it provides      fairness and flexibility, and has probably pushed the Fish      and Wildlife Service further than we ever thought we could      go. But Bruce Babbitt can't trump Congress. Bruce Babbitt      didn't do this - Congress did."    </p>        <p>      Specifically, it was Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX),      who sponsored the moratorium amendment in 1995. A      spokesperson for the senator's office states that Hutchison      didn't design the moratorium to save taxpayers' money but      rather to "strike a balance between the need to preserve      species, and to protect private property rights of private      land owners."    </p>    <p>      "My sense," says Defenders of Wildlife's William Snape, "is      that the Endangered Species Act is sort of a red meat issue      for the far right. Because the Endangered Species Act even      dares to regulate private property, the far right has      decided that it is going to make an example of the      Endangered Species Act to the rest of the public."    </p>    <p>      When asked if the moratorium was expected to be lifted in      the near future, Hutchison's office remarked, "Not by the      end of this fiscal year."    </p>    <p>      Environmental experts suggest that the greatest hope for      the reinstatement of the Endangered Species Act is the      outspoken support of the public.    </p>    <p>      "I don't think that the majority of the congressional      delegation understands that the American public is against      extinction and that the American public supports species      conservation," says the Fish and Wildlife Division's Jamie      Clark.    </p>        <p>      For information on the current status of the Endangered      Species Act contact the following:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fish and Wildlife Division</strong><br />      (202)208- 5634<br />      1849 C Street NW<br />      Washington, D.C. 20240    </p>    <p>      <strong>William Snape</strong><br />      c/o The Defenders of Wildlife<br />      1101 Fourteenth Street NW, #1400<br />      Washington, D.C. 20005<br />      (202)682-1331    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison</strong><br />      (202)224-5922<br />      Senate Office Building<br />      First and Constitution Avenue NE<br />      Washington, D.C. 20005    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Brazil Nut Incident</strong>    </p>    <p>      They were light tan, small, and ovular, like conventional      soybeans. But during a study sponsored by the Pioneer      Hi-Bred International company, scientists at the University      of Nebraska found these genetically engineered beans to be      anything but ordinary. The transgenic soybeans,which Pioneer HiBred had 			infused with Brazil nut proteins, contained a potentially deadly allergen 			know as 2S Albumin.    </p>        <p>      "An allergen is a protein that people react to, and can      cause reactions ranging from itching to upset stomach to      death," said Dr. Marion Nestle, a molecular biologist and      nutritionist with New York University. "I really thought      that the possibility of transferring an allergen from one      food to another was a remote one. I was floored when I      heard about this."    </p>    <p>      The Brazil nut incident has re-ignited the ongoing debate      over the Food and Drug Administration's labeling of      genetically engineered foods. According to Dr. Margaret      Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington,      D.C., the FDA is disregarding the public's desire to have      genetically engineered foods labeled.    </p>    <p>      "Almost every survey that has been done says that consumers      would like to be told," says Mellon. "But consumer desires      and fifty  cents will get you about a cup of coffee at the      FDA."    </p>    <p>      Dr. Mellon claims that although the FDA does have a policy      of labeling biogenetically engineered foods, it is one that      caters to the biotech companies themselves.    </p>    <p>      "The FDA policy relies heavily on the industry in making      its decisions about premarket review and notification.      Instead of making these decisions itself, the agency      provides decision trees for industry. The policy relies      almost entirely on the industry to make the right      decisions. Since the FDA will not be aware of the full      range of genetically engineered products, it will not be in      a position to overrule these decisions."    </p>    <p>      Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, all GRAS      (Generally Recognized As Safe) substances won't require      premarket government approval. The labeling of all other      foods is the responsibility of the biotech companies      themselves, a responsibility that Dr. Mellon feels won't be      fulfilled unless it serves a company's needs.    </p>    <p>      "Companies," she says, "will voluntarily label engineered      food only when the engineering has produced a trait with      direct appeal or benefit to the consumer."    </p>    <p>      In the case of the allergenic soybeans, Pioneer Hi-Bred      International acted quickly and responsibly in publicly      reporting their findings.    </p>    <p>      "When we did the first work, we knew there was a potential      for allergenicity, and that's why we sponsored the      University of Nebraska study," says Pioneer Hi-Bred      spokesman Tim Martin. "When we actually got confirmation      that there was an allergen involved we decided to      discontinue the program and look in other directions."    </p>    <p>      To date, only one biogenetically engineered food, the      Flavr-Savr tomato, has been certified as marketable by the      Food and Drug Administration. The Flavr-Savr, designed by      Calgene Incorporated, is a tomato designed to stay fresh      longer than conventional tomatoes. According to Calgene,      the Flavr-Savr will be in stores starting January 1997. It      will be labeled as a genetically modified food and will      come with an information packet explaining the science of      genetic food modification.    </p>    <p>      Most experts agree that the presence of modified foods in      our stores, our restaurants, and our kitchens is imminent.      According to John Henkel of the FDA consumer magazine,      approximately 100 to 150 biogenetically engineered foods      will be introduced within the next four years.    </p>    <p>      When asked how she predicts the Food and Drug      Administration, university scientists, and major biotech      companies will find a successful resolution to the current      labeling situation, Dr. Nestle admits, "We don't really      know."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother Nature's Shopping List</strong>    </p>    <p>      "It's easy to save the planet," says author Michael Shook,      "you just have to know where to start."    </p>    <p>      According to Shook, the idea behind <em>Mother Nature's      Shopping List</em> came to him after he'd read many of the      other environmental books that were already out on the      market.    </p>    <p>      "I read them," says Shook, "and I thought, 'these are good,      but they're starting in the wrong place: Most of those      books focused on recycling, and I wanted to go one step      further and write about pre-cycling."    </p>    <p>      <em>Mother Nature's Shopping List</em> is a simple guide to      making planet-conscious purchases at the supermarket, the      hardware store, the clothing store, the automotive shop,      the office supply center, the appliance store, the drug      store, and the garden center. The book also has several      special sections with titles like "Shopping for Baby,"      "Odds and Ends," and "Getting Involved."    </p>    <p>      "One of the nice things about the book," says Shook, "is      that it tells you what companies are trying to become earth      friendly, and which ones aren't. Also, it includes some      great recipes for making nontoxic household products that      make a small impact on both the planet and the pocketbook."    </p>    <p>      When he's not writing books, Shook pursues the life of a      passionate Colorado outdoorsman, spending his days creating      angling guides for river regions across the country, and      his nights thinking up an assorted variety of new and      different ways to save the world.    </p>    <p>      For more information on <em>Mother Nature's Shopping      List</em> by Michael D.
