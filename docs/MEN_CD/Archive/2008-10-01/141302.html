        <p class="aBodyBlack3">One of the questions I am frequently asked when I am speaking in various countries is, given the environmental problems that the world is facing, can we make it? That is, can we avoid economic decline and the collapse of civilization? My answer is always the same: it depends on you and me, on what you and I do to reverse these trends. It means becoming politically active. Saving our civilization is not a spectator sport.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">We have moved into this new world so fast that we have not yet fully grasped the meaning of what is happening. Traditionally, concern for our children has translated into getting them the best health care and education possible. But if we do not act quickly to reverse the Earth’s environmental deterioration, eradicate poverty, and stabilize <a title="population" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-And-Community/Talking-About-Population.aspx" target="_blank">population</a>, their world will decline economically and disintegrate politically.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">The two overriding policy challenges are to restructure taxes and reorder fiscal priorities. Saving civilization means restructuring taxes to get the market to tell the ecological truth. And it means reordering fiscal priorities to get the resources needed for Plan B. Write, call or e-mail your elected representative about the need for tax restructuring to create an honest market. Remind him or her that corporations that left costs off the books appeared to prosper in the short run, only to collapse in the long run.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">Or better yet, gather some like-minded friends together to meet with your elected representatives to discuss why we need to raise environmental taxes and reduce income taxes. Before the meeting, draft a brief statement of your collective concerns and the policy initiatives needed. Feel free to download the information on tax restructuring in Chapter 13 of Earth Policy Institute's <a title="Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization" href="http://www.earthpolicy.org/Books/PB3/Contents.htm" target="_blank">Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization</a>.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">Let your political representatives know that a world spending more than $1 trillion a year for military purposes is simply out of sync with reality when the future of civilization is in question. Ask them if the <a title="Plan B budget" href="http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB3/PB3ch13_ss6.htm" target="_blank">Plan B budget</a> - an additional $190 billion a year for eradicating poverty, stabilizing population and restoring the Earth - is an unreasonable expenditure to save civilization. Ask them if diverting one sixth of the global military budget to saving civilization is too costly. Introduce them to Plan B. Remind them of how we mobilized in World War II.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">Make a case for the inclusion of poverty eradication, family planning, reforestation and renewable energy development in international assistance programs. Urge an increase in these appropriations and a cut in military appropriations, pointing out that advanced weapons systems are useless in dealing with the new threats to our security. Someone needs to speak on behalf of our children and grandchildren, because it is their world that is at stake.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">In short, we need to persuade our elected representatives and leaders to support the changes outlined in Plan B. We need to lobby them for these changes as though our future and that of our children depended on it - because it does.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">Educate yourself on environmental issues. If you found this book useful, share it with others. It can be <a title="downloaded" href="http://www.earthpolicy.org/Books/PB3/index.htm" target="_blank">downloaded</a> free of charge. If you want to know what happened to earlier civilizations that also found themselves in environmental trouble, read <a title="Collapse" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed" target="_blank">Collapse</a> by Jared Diamond or <a title="A Short History of Progress" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Progress" target="_blank">A Short History of Progress</a> by Ronald Wright.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">If you like to write, try your hand at an op-ed piece for your local newspaper on the need to raise taxes on environmentally destructive activities and offset this with a lowering of income taxes. Try a letter to the editor. Put together your own personal e-mail list to help you communicate useful information to friends, colleagues, and local opinion leaders.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">The scale and urgency of the challenge we face has no precedent, but what we need to do can be done. It is doable. Sit down and map out your own personal plan and timetable for what you want to do to move the world off a path headed toward economic decline and onto one of sustainable economic progress. Set your own goals. Identify people in your community you can work with to achieve these goals. Pick an issue that is meaningful to you, such as restructuring the tax system, banning inefficient light bulbs, phasing out coal-fired power plants, or working for “complete streets” that are pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly in your community. What could be more exciting and rewarding?</p><p class="aBodyBlack3">The choice is ours - yours and mine. We can stay with business as usual and preside over an economy that continues to destroy its natural support systems until it destroys itself, or we can adopt Plan B and be the generation that changes direction, moving the world onto a path of sustained progress. The choice will be made by our generation, but it will affect life on earth for all generations to come.</p><p class="aBodyBlack3"></p><hr /><p class="abodyblack3"><a title="Sign up" href="http://www.earth-policy.org/Subscribe/index.htm" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for the Earth Policy News email list.
