        <p>When it comes to hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, most people may think of the <a title="Toyota Prius" href="http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/" target="_blank">Toyota Prius</a> and its competitors, but a growing stable of heavy trucks are now featuring hybrid technology. At last week's <a title="Hybrid Truck Users Forum" href="http://www.calstart.org/programs/htuf/" target="_blank">Hybrid Truck Users Forum</a> in South Bend, Ind., hybrid trucks from a wide range of manufacturers were on display, including the Kenworth T370 Hybrid, a Class 7 diesel-electric hybrid tractor designed for local-haul applications, including beverage, freight and grocery distribution. Introduced in late September, the hybrid tractor has a motor/generator integrated into its transmission, powered by a 340-volt lithium-ion battery pack. Its power management system allows the tractor to operate in three modes: electric-only, diesel-only and combined electric and diesel power. <a title="The Kenworth Truck Company" href="http://www.kenworth.com/1000_hom.asp" target="_blank">The Kenworth Truck Co</a>., a division of <a title="PACCAR Inc." href="http://www.paccar.com/" target="_blank">PACCAR Inc.</a>, expects the hybrid tractor to improve fuel economy by up to 25 percent in local-haul applications. Kenworth also displayed the T270 Hybrid, a Class 6 tractor that it launched in 2007.</p><p><a title="Peterbilt Motors Company" href="http://www.peterbilt.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">Peterbilt Motors Co</a>., another division of PACCAR, arrived in South Bend with three hybrid-electric models: a delivery van, a utility truck and a municipal dump truck. Using a hybrid drive developed by <a title="Eaton Corporation" href="http://www.eaton.com/EatonCom/index.htm" target="_blank">Eaton Corp</a>., the van and dump truck both achieve a 30 percent improvement in fuel economy, while the utility truck can avoid idling by drawing on its battery pack for power, potentially cutting its fuel consumption in half. Peterbilt also displayed a refuse truck that uses a hydraulic system to capture energy during braking and to help launch and accelerate the vehicle, for a 25 percent improvement in fuel economy. In addition, <a title="Freightliner Trucks" href="http://www.freightlinertrucks.com/" target="_blank">Freightliner Trucks</a> displayed its Business Class M2e Hybrid, which also features an Eaton hybrid system. The company is offering a $5,000 incentive on the vehicle through mid-December. In addition, <a href="http://www.dueco.com/" title="Dueco, Inc." target="_blank">Dueco, Inc.</a> displayed two plug-in hybrid electric utility trucks, featuring a system developed by <a title="Odyne Corporation" href="http://www.odyne.com/" target="_blank">Odyne Corp</a>. Other hybrid vehicles that were on display include a variety of hybrid trucks and buses from <a title="Azure Dynamics Inc" href="http://www.azuredynamics.com/" target="_blank">Azure Dynamics Inc</a>., refuse trucks from <a title="Bosch Rexroth AG" href="http://www.boschrexroth.com/corporate/en/index.jsp;jsessionid=cbaYchXqAhbFrebAqNL0r" target="_blank">Bosch Rexroth AG</a>, delivery and utility trucks from Eaton, and a variety of trucks from Navistar. </p><p></p><hr /><h5>Reprinted from <a title="EERE Network News" href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm" target="_blank">EERE Network News</a>, a free newsletter of the U.S. Department of Energy.</h5>
