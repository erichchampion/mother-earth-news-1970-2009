        The idea of recharging a car at home may sound strange, but 100 mpg will probably help you get over that real quick. Plug-in hybrids offer the best of gasoline-electric hybrids and all-electric cars: the ability to drive in pure electric mode (thus zero gas used), a gas engine to fall back on when needed and the ability to recharge at home.
