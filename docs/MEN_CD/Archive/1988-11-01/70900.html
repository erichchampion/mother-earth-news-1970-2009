                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>            <p>      I'VE RECEIVED AS GIFTS THOSE little ceramic pots that      simmer herbs and spices, and I enjoy filling the house with      enticing aromas, especially during the holiday season. I      found, though, that heating the water in the pot to boiling      used up so much of the candle, I'd soon have to replace it      to keep the brew on simmer for any length of time. Now I      heat the pot and its contents in my microwave for about a      minute on medium-high (the high setting makes it boil      over).    </p>    <p>      After that the candle flame keeps it going for a long time.      <em>-Karen Goebel<br />      Victoria, Texas</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Double-Duty Debris</strong>    </p>    <p>      My mobile home has skirting, but that doesn't keep the cold      Michigan winds from blowing through and chilling from      underneath the floor. My heating bill for the winter of      1986-87 was $1,200! I worried about it through the next      summer, but didn't have the funds to insulate. In the fall,      though, I found the solution in a nearby neighborhood.    </p>    <p>      All the residents bagged their leaves and left them at the      curb. I simply collected the bags (after asking permission)      and packed them around the bottom of my trailer. That      winter my fuel bill dropped to $300-and by spring I      had lots of free compost for my garden. <em>-John      Peebles<br />      Three Rivers, Michigan</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Linger No Longer</strong> Sometimes it just      happens. Your fireplace or woodstove "backpuffs" (or you      forget to open the damper!), and the room fills with smoke.      Airing the room may clear out the smoke, but the acrid odor      lingers.    </p>    <p>      What to do? Set some soup bowls half-filled with cider      vinegar around the room. When the liquid becomes dark,      replace it with fresh, and keep this up till the odor is      gone. <em>-Julian H. Youngman<br />      Marshall, Texas</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sour Dreams</strong>    </p>    <p>      I was completely delighted with our new "dream house,"      until I realized there was no pilot light      anywhere-something I'd always used as a warm place to      raise dough. I was wandering around the rooms, sourdough      starter in hand, when I found myself staring at a little      yellow light. It was the signal on our waterbed indicating      that the heat was on. The temperature was set for      100°F, just perfect for my purposes.    </p>    <p>      I tucked the covered dish of starter under the covers (on      my husband's side, in case the idea backfired), and checked      it in an hour or so. It was the bubbliest, happiest      sourdough starter you ever saw. The warm, even heat cut      rising time in half, too, so I figure modern technology has      redeemed itself again. <em>-Martha Lyle<br />      Perryville, Kentucky</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Rubber on Rubber</strong>    </p>    <p>      If your car gets stuck in the snow, and there's no shovel      or sand in your trunk, place your rubber or plastic floor      mats under the tires. <em>-Audrey Snyder<br />      Olympia, Washington</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Liter Lore</strong>    </p>    <p>      Because I use so much birdseed during the colder months, I      buy it in the largest bags I can find. Storing these,      especially the leftovers from one season to another, had      been a pain. If the open bag didn't get knocked over and      spilled, the weevils or mice got to the seed. Now, though,      I wash out and save three-liter pop bottles and pour the      birdseed into these as soon as I buy it. (I use the top      half of a two-liter bottle as a funnel.)    </p>    <p>      Each large bottle holds about five pounds of seed, exactly      what my feeders take every time they're filled. This job is      made much easier, as the seed can be quickly poured in with      no waste.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Tommie Majors<br />      Lead Hill, Arkansas</em><br />    </p>		<p><strong>Cold Seas, Warm      Hands</strong></p>        <p>      The very best protection for the hands of our Nova Scotian      fishing folk are hand-knit mittens made from 100% undyed      wool. These are fashioned extremely large, as the salt      water soon shrinks them. And the benefit of this shrinking      is that the mittens become virtually waterproof. I knit      these same oversized mitts for my son, then soak them a few      times in plain water. They end up so watertight that they      can be coated with wet slush and still his hands stay warm      and dry. <em>Judy Hutchins<br />      Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>A New Angle on an Old Problem</strong>    </p>    <p>      Like many car owners, I spend a bit of time on icy winter      mornings defrosting the windshield. This will happen faster      if you pull the visors down to a 45° angle to the      glass, thus catching the hot air and forcing it back      against the windshield. <em>-Anthony D. Andrews<br />      Osceola, Missouri</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fast Flames</strong>    </p>    <p>      If your fireplace or woodstove is supplied with dry, cured      wood and the proper kindling, you can start a fire with a      lighted twist of newspaper. But for those occasions when my      wood is a bit green or wet, I've got a small stock of      "sure-fire" starters. I bought some of those ready-made      logs (I look for the ones with the fewest chemicals added),      and cut them into random-sized chunks. For very little cost      or labor, I'm assured a quick-starting fire, no matter      what. <em>-Dan Crawford<br />      Arlington, Texas</em>    </p>
