                <p>      <strong>ENERGY TIPS</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Two weekend project ideas for slashing fuel bills.</em>    </p>        <h3>      THERMAL MASS    </h3>    <p>      When I was around ten, my mother decided to build herself a      modest 3' x 7' step-in greenhouse as a small addition to      the family room. She and my father sat around the kitchen      table for weeks, poring over plans and deciding how they      could piece it together without going broke. And each day I      came from school to find something different; a large hole      in the southfacing wall, sheets of plastic as temporary      windows, piles of bricks, concrete. For a while it was      better than television. In a month, construction was      finished, and we had a handsome little topiary bubble      sticking out of the house like a turret. The first hot      weekend in May, however, brought a shock for my Mom. That      bubble, while we were away for just one warm, sunny      weekend, had managed to kill all but the hardiest of Mom's      plants and turn the family room into a convection oven. It      was my first lesson in just how much heat a few windows can      muster. Mom and Dad restocked the plants, invested in some      reflective shades and monitored the weather a little more      closely after that.    </p>        <p>      Nearly all homes have some southern facing glass, but most      homes, especially older ones, were not built to take      advantage of the heat energy those windows can transmit.      One low-cost and simple way of taking advantage of southern      exposure is through the addition of thermal mass material,      which absorbs the heat energy and stores it, radiating the      stored heat during the cool fall and winter evenings. You      can do this by placing a substantial amount of heat-holding      material such as masonry, concrete or containers of water      where the sun can shine on them. This thermal mass will      help to prevent the sunny room from being overheated and      will reduce the need for opening windows or shading out the      sun's free energy just to maintain comfort. At night, this      mass will radiate its stored solar heat and reduce the need      for conventional heat.    </p>    <p>      There are many ways to add thermal mass to a room. The      challenge is to add enough. Try to provide 2 to 4 gallons      (1/4 to 1/2 cubic feet) of water per square foot of south      window, or 1/2 to 1 cubic foot. (75 to 150 lbs.) of      concrete or masonry per square foot. If the mass is not in      direct sunlight, double or triple these amounts. If you      have a concrete slab, you already have plenty of thermal      mass - just allow the sun to reach it. The mass      should be dark-colored to absorb radiation and should be      placed as close to the window as possible so that the      sunshine hits it all day. It's important, though, that the      windows should normally overheat the space where the      thermal mass material is placed. If the windows don't      overheat the space, the mass won't attain the higher      temperatures needed to help with heating, except by      moderating uncomfortable temperature change.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Variations</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you have a strong floor, you can pour a thin 2" - 4"      concrete slab over it, or lay down brick or heavy      tile.<br />      Steel drums or racks of water-filled containers could act      as partitions or furniture.<br />      An interior wall that receives sunlight could be lined with      stone or brick.<br />      <br />      <strong>Advantages</strong><br />      <br />      The addition of thermal mass does not increase the amount      of solar energy available to a space, but it lengthens the      time you can use the heat.<br />      Thermal mass moderates temperature swings between day and      night keeping the space more comfortable.<br />      Excess heat that might otherwise be thrown away is saved      and used later.<br />      Thermal mass has no moving or complex processes. It simply      sits there and does its job without your time or      effort.<br />      Thermal mass materials are common and inexpensive. Concrete      runs $40.00 to $60.00 per cubic yard (27 cubic feet). Water      is almost free. Containers, such as steel drums or plastic      jugs, can be scrounged or bought secondhand. Figure $1 to      $2 per square foot of window area.<br />      <br />      <strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />      <br />      Thermal mass requires bulky materials and often takes up a      lot of space. It's often difficult to add more in a      graceful way that's acceptable to your existing      decor.<br />      The structure of your house may need strengthening before      it can support the considerable weight of thermal mass. To      be sure, check out the foundation and floor before you load      in the mass.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BATCH HEATERS</strong>    </p>        <p>      Another way to take advantage of the sun's considerable      heat energy is through a batch heater (sometimes called a      breadbox). A batch heater, nothing more than a greenhouse      for heating water, is a water tank painted black, mounted      in a well-insulated box, and covered by a sheet of glazing.      The batch heater preheats the cold water from your well or      municipal water supply, reducing the amount of energy your      water heater uses. The best location for a batch heater is      an unshaded area in the yard on the south side of your home      or as close as possible to your existing tank.    </p>    <p>      The sun's energy passes through the glazing and is absorbed      by the black surface of the tank. This heat is immediately      transferred to the colder water in the tank, supplied from      your well or municipal water service. On a warm sunny      summer day, the water in the tank may reach 140°F. This      preheated water then flows to a well insulated outlet pipe      to your home's water heater. As the warm water is delivered      to your home, it is replaced in the tank by cold water from      the inlet pipe and the cycle continues.<br />      <br />      To get the most hot water from this solar system, use only      a single layer of glass. Including a reflector in the      design will increase the amount of solar energy the tank      receives. The water lines going to and from the solar tank      should be well insulated and kept as short as possible.    </p>    <p>      The batch heater needs to be drained at the first sign of a      severe frost and refilled in the spring when all danger of      frost has passed. This heater little maintenance -      every two years add a fresh coat of paint and check the      sacrificial rod that is placed in the tank to reduce      corrosion.    </p>		       <p>      A batch heater is an excellent choice for a water-heating      system. It's inexpensive and takes a moderate amount of      experience with carpentry and plumbing to build. It will      pay for itself very quickly, especially if it is combined      with the hot water conservation measures. The batch heater      is flexible - if you have a sunny wall, you can build      a freestanding version.    </p>    <p>      Some commercial solar water heaters are based on this      design. By using advanced materials, they do not freeze in      the winter and can be used year round.    </p>    <p>      Construction of a batch heater, including $50 for energy      conservation measures on your existing hot water system,      will cost between $500 and $ 1,000. A batch heater can cut      your hot water bill by half when it operates, or up to 1200      kWh per year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Variations</strong>    </p>    <p>      The batch heater can be oriented in a north-south direction      or it can also stretch in an east-west direction. Purchased      versions of this design use several layers of glazing and      operate year round    </p>    <p>      <strong>Advantages</strong>    </p>    <p>      This hot-water system is the cheapest and simplest to      build. For the cost it puts out a good amount of hot water.      <strong>Disadvantages</strong> The total hot water      production is lower than some other systems because the      batch heater is not used all year.    </p>        <h3>      What It Costs to Run Electrical Appliances    </h3>    <p>      Unless indicated, costs are measured per hour.
