            		<p>		 <strong>PET HEALTH</strong>		 </p>        <p>      <em>Andrea Looney, D.V.M., provides some quick solutions to      your farmyard animal problems.</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      My four-year-old golden retriever had a small bump on his      head where a tick once was. How do I know the tick isn't<br />      still in there?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Brenda Franklin<br />      Cairo, NY</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Brenda:    </p>    	    <p>      Quite frankly, you don't! A tick will penetrate the skin      with its head and mouth, leaving the remainder of its body      outside the epidermis to expand as it fills with blood.      When done with the meal, the tick backs out of the skin,      leaving behind a sore or area of inflammation that it      produced as it invaded the tissue. This sore can be as      large as the tick itself. It eventually will heal as the      body "fills in" the area of penetration with new cells      (fibrosis).    </p>    <p>      Problems occur when folks attempt to remove the pests from      the animal and do so incompletely. The head can break off      as people attempt to pull the tick out and is often left in      the animal's skin. The skin reacts to the remainder of the      tick (head) like it would to a foreign substance and      attempts to "wall it off" or surround it with stronger more      rugged tissue (granulation or proud flesh).    </p>    <p>      Most of the time, the animal's body will break down or      expel the remaining parasite; warm-water compresses will      help this to occur and assist with healing of the wound.      Sometimes, however, it is necessary for a veterinarian to      surgically remove the nodule.    </p>    <p>      It is very unlikely that the entire tick would burrow under      the skin and remain there since it too needs oxygen to      survive. I suspect that the small bump you see on your      pup's head is most likely simple scar tissue secondary to      the tick bite.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      My poodle-mix puppy is constantly tilting his head and      holding one ear funny. What can we do to treat ear mites?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Kaye McIver<br />      Red Bluff, CA</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Kaye:    </p>    <p>      First off, it is a rarity for dogs to have "ear mites." The      mite, <em>Otodectes</em> , is a common parasite of the      external ear canal of cats and ferrets but rarely affects      dogs. However, dogs do succumb to a variety of bacterial      and yeast ear infections quite readily. Poodles, cocker      spaniels, and golden retrievers seem to be prone to these      because of their ear anatomy and internal hair.    </p>    <p>      Moistness and humidity play a great role in ear infections.      The key to success in treating these infections is keeping      the ear dry. Do not use alcohol or pour anything down the      ear canal. Simply try using soft tissue or gauze, wiping      down as far as you can. Do not use cotton, as it will stick      to the inflamed tissue, and don't use swabs, as they will      tend to push the infection farther in. Air alone is a great      drying agent, so you might try to tape the ear flaps up on      top of the head for a few days. A 50/50 mixture of vinegar      and warm water is useful for gently cleaning after you've      dried and removed most of the debris. It will help      eliminate some of the fungus. An antibiotic may be      necessary from your veterinarian to treat the bacteria.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DON'T USE ALCOHOL</strong><br />      One of the best ways to treat an ear infection is simply to      keep the affected area dry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our pet Nubian goat, Flower, got loose the other day and      jumped the fence. It appears that she may have broken her      leg. She's walking on the leg, but very tenderly. Will it      heal? Can we do anything?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Elizabeth Martinez<br />      Taos, NM</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Elizabeth:    </p>        <p>      Will it heal? Chances are, yes. Will it heal correctly      without some type of cast or fixation? No, probably not.      The best thing you can do outside of having your      veterinarian take some x-rays and apply a cast, would be to      confine Flower to a box stall with access to a very small      outdoor area. Make sure she gets some sun, which helps      vitamin D metabolism and is important for healing all      tissues. Minimize her jumping and climbing by providing her      with food at nose level and soft grassy ground with little      to no large rocks. To relieve the pain, cold pack the limb      at least once a day for the first week. You might even      stand Flower in a bucket and run cool water over the limb      if the injury is in the lower leg. You can also give her a      couple of adult buffered aspirin once a day, or every other      day, for a few weeks to help bring down the swelling.    </p>    <p>      While it's common for tethered goats to injure themselves,      it's fairly uncommon for most adult goats to fracture their      limbs while running and jumping since they are a mountain      animal. I'd suggest checking the quality, freshness, and      calcium/phosphorus content of your feedstuffs to assure      yourself that the fractures aren't related to nutrition.      Also, bad bruises and sprains of ligaments and tendons are      much more common than fractures but often appear so sore      that the animal will be just as lame for just as long. Rest      and whirlpool therapy will really help these injuries as      well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      We have a terrible time with grubs in our holstein-heifer      herd. What can you do to get rid of these nasty pests?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Andrew Baron<br />      Carbondale, IL</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Andrew:    </p>    	    <p>      Grubs are parasitic fly larvae. Botflies, as they are also      called, are usually members of the genus <em>Hypoderma</em>      . They look like bees and lay their eggs on the hair of the      legs and lower belly of cattle. The eggs hatch and the      larvae burrow through the skin, setting off on a long      migration through the cow's muscles and connective tissues      until they reach the skin on the back. Here, each grub      forms a subcutaneous lump with a breathing hole through the      skin, and remains here destroying tissue until they drop      out, mature into a fly, and start the whole cycle over      again.    </p>    <p>      These little critters are really pests as departments of      agriculture all over the world can attest. Thousands of      dollars have been lost from cattle that have spent time      bothered by grubs instead of making milk or grazing. There      are many sprays, pour-ons, powders, and injections that      will treat these pests, but extreme care must be taken in      choosing one or the other for milking animals. In mildly      affected cows, it is best just to leave the grubs alone or      inject a small amount of hydrogen peroxide into their      breathing holes in the skin with a blunt teat cannula. This      is usually effective in forcing them out of the skin. Do      not pinch or squash them in the animal's skin or attempt to      extrude them from their lumps with manual pressure, as the      proteins these grubs exude can cause anaphylactic shock.      Fly control in the barn via mucking and fly strips is      essential in controlling these parasites.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our quarter-horse mare has had a bad case of thrush for the      past seven months. We've tried all types of topical      medications to no avail. Is there something we're missing?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Eric Kilburn<br />      Glasgow, KY</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Eric:    </p>    <p>      Thrush is an infection of the frog, or triangle-shaped,      sensitive area on the underside of the horse's hoof. Many      horses will have this in one or two feet and will become      moderately lame with it. The feet will be soft and will      exude a foul odor.    </p>    <p>      The most important aspect of treating the disease is to      give the animal <em>clean, dry</em> bedding. Moisture and      dirt precipitate the problems. Fresh daily sawdust or      shavings is 100% better than straw but a bit more      expensive. Clean the underside of the foot to remove manure      and dead tissue, thereafter cleaning the feet daily with a      hoof pick. A variety of astringents can be used: witch      hazel, copper sulfate, or alcohol. One that I have found to      be very beneficial is very dilute liquid bleach solution (a      teaspoon to a bucket of water). Use this to clean the sole      and frog daily. But bear in mind that no medication will      work if the animal is constantly standing in moisture,      manure, or mud.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our nine-year-old female Brittany spaniel, Chelsea, started      losing her hair and slowing down about a month ago. Her      tail is almost bare and our veterinarian believes her      thyroid gland isn't working. Could you explain this      phenomenon?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Christine Baylor<br />      Wilksboro, NC</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Christine:    </p>    <p>      The thyroid gland is known as the master gland in the body      because the hormone it secretes governs so many important      cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and other      endocrine functions. The cause of hypothyroidism in the      dog, as it is known, is primarily either an atrophy or      glandular collapse, or may be related to an autoimmune      destruction of the gland itself. A less common cause of      primary thyroid disease is severe iodine deficiency with      resulting goiter, but this doesn't occur commonly in dogs      fed commercial diets.    </p>    <p>      The clinical signs of hypothyroidism can vary among dogs,      but the overall effect is a reduced metabolic state. As a      result, dogs with hypothyroidism tend to gain weight,      sometimes to the point of obesity. They fatigue easily with      exercise and become less active. Some even develop a marked      intolerance to cold and may seek out heat sources such as      registers or vents. They may become anemic because of their      decreased metabolic rate and oxygen utilization.    </p>    <p>      Dogs with hypothyroidism are frequently presented to the      veterinarian with primary complaints of skin and hair coat      problems. Affected dogs lack luster to their coat and      baldness of varying degrees occurs; a common characteristic      is baldness of the tail. Owners may also complain that the      nose changes color and indeed, it does become more      pigmented. The skin becomes scaly and more prone to      superficial infections, due to abnormal deposition of the      upper layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum.    </p>    <p>      Your dog can be tested for this disease via two methods.      One involves a simple blood test that checks for a      subnormal level of thyroid hormone. The other involves      actually stimulating the thyroid gland and analyzing a      blood sample afterward to assess the amount of thyroid      hormone produced. Although rather expensive, the second      method is preferred and considered to be a more accurate      method of assessing an animal suspected of having the      disease.    </p>    <p>      Hypothyroidism can be treated with long-term      oral-replacement therapy. Most dogs are supplemented with      thyroid hormone on a once- to twice-a-day basis. The skin      lesions and changes in hair coat may require several months      to return to normal, but for the most part, this is      considered a treatable disease in middle-age to geriatric      animals.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      My two-year-old, 125-pound, Great Dane doesn't enjoy being      indoors. I built him an insulated house and am considering      a heating element with his straw bed. Any advice?    </p>    <p>      <em>- Tom Ciras<br />      Charlton, MA</em>    </p>        <p>      Dear Tom:    </p>    <p>      The outside dog needs a snug house for protection from the      elements, especially strong sun and wind. Except in very      cold climates, it should not be insulated. Why? Because      insulation or heating allows the humidity to build up,      causing condensation to form. The condensation has two ill      effects. First, it invites mold to form. Second, it chills      the animal. You can minimize the formation of condensation      by creating a space between the roof and walls, allowing      air to circulate in and naturally gry the internal      atmosphere.    </p>    <p>      There should be plenty of bedding in the house and straw is      an excellent choice. It should be straw, not hay, and be      changed periodically for parasite control and simple      cleanliness. A combination of the two - straw and      heat/moisture not only encourages mold, but fleas and      intestinal parasites as well, so try to pick the driest      straw you can.    </p>    <p>      It's funny how most dog houses look like our own houses      (peaked roof with shingles) when in actuality many dogs      love to lay on top of their homes. Thus, the roof should be      flat, with a mild slope and either painted dark or covered      with a dark heavy rubber or carpet. The dark colors will      also absorb the natural heat of the sun and allow the      animal a choice of heat with wind (roof) or heat without      wind (straw-enclosed bottom) in cooler climates.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FORGET THE MATS AND THE BLANKETS:</strong><br />      Dry straw, changed periodically, is all most dogs need for      warmth in an outside house.    </p>
