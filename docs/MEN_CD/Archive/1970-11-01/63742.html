                   <h5 id="byline">by NANCY PIERSON FARRIS</h5>    <p>      When we started our homestead we planned to raise as much      of our own food as possible . . . but we <em>intended</em>      to begin with chickens and vegetables. Our schemes were      turned upside down, however, by a visit in July to a goat      dairy.    </p>    <p>      We had gone "just to look around" because we did      want-eventually-to produce our own dairy      products. While at the dairy, though, we were surprised to      learn that kids are usually available only from February to      July . . . so, naturally, we bought the only kid still for      sale and drove home with her in the back seat of the car.    </p>    <p>      We didn't even have a place to house the little 3-month old      Alpine grade doeling and for several weeks "Bunnie" shared      quarters with our pump. We bought a dog collar and used a      length of clothesline to tether her in the backyard, near      the pumphouse. Meanwhile, we erected framing for our 12' x      21' all-purpose barn and dried-in the first 3-foot square      kid stall. Then Bunnie moved in while we completed the 9' x      12' goat section, the 12' x 12' henhouse and the feed room      area of the barn.    </p>    <p>      During construction, we used a metal drum for dry feed      storage. Now we keep feed in a freezer cabinet which we      obtained free-for-the-hauling from a local appliance      dealer.    </p>    <p>      Finding that first goat is sometimes a problem. A friend of      a friend directed us to ours and the local grapevine is      often the best source of information. Some states publish a      Market Bulletin-available at no charge-that      lists goats for sale. County agents can also help would-be      buyers    </p>    <p>      Choice of a breed is entirely an individual decision. The      uniformly-white Saanen is reputed to produce the most milk      and the milk of Nubians has the highest butterfat content.      Nubians may be any color but always have long drooping ears      and a Roman nose. Toggenburgs, always some shade of brown      with a white stripe down each side of the face, are popular      in some areas and Alpines (which may be any color or      combination) are gaining favor among breeders.    </p>                <p>      Our first goat was an Alpine, mainly because she was      available. We've now switched to Nubians because a Nubian      buck is handy in our area and because we like the      appearance of this breed. Since a buck must be quartered      separately and fed year-round we've found it impractical in      the past to keep our own. We've now decided to give it a      try, however, and we're raising our own purebred buck.    </p>    <p>      Our first doe was a grade (not necessarily purebred)      Alpine. gave a gallon of milk daily after freshening and      tapered to a pint a day at the end of lactation. The      registered Nubian we now milk is in her first lactation      and-after eight months-consistently gives a      quart and a half of milk daily. We expect her production to      double or triple within the next three years.    </p>    <p>      The grade Alpine was purchased in 1961 for $6.00. This      spring (1970) we bought two grade Nubian doelings for      $12.50 apiece and a registered Nubian, ready to freshen,      for $75.00. The grades were named Lassie and Heidi and the      registered (as Marlu Laura's Susie) doeling-because      of her temperament-is called Lady Susan.    </p>    <p>      By the way, one doe can be kept alone but goats are      sociable animals and prefer company.    </p>    <p>      Our acre is bounded on two sides by brush-lined drainage      ditches. We first drove sturdy stakes into the ground at      30-foot intervals and tethered Bunnie with a 15-foot chain      attached to a dog collar. Later, we purchased a mule hawser      for a tether. We've learned, when staking out two does, to      separate them enough so they can't get their chains tangled      together.    </p>    <p>      We tether our goats outside for grazing every day except      during very cold or rainy weather when they could get      pneumonia if not sheltered.    </p>    <p>      Our goats have all preferred leafy browse to grass. They'll      eat briars, small brush and leaves from the low-hanging      branches of trees. One of their favorite browsing spots is      a patch of wild privet. They also eat pea or bean vines      that are not withered, cornstalks, young wheat and clover      and tomato plants (including the tomatoes). Alfalfa makes      good goat pasture and hay but it doesn't grow in our area.    </p>    <p>      Do not plan to feed goats on kitchen scraps. They'll eat      very little of such offerings. It's also wise to keep the      animals away from ornamental plantings. We have pine and      magnolia trees that are wellbushed due to impromptu pruning      and our goats have nearly killed a pear and an apricot      tree!    </p>    <p>      A well-fed animal will instinctively avoid any plant which      is injurious to its health. Apparently our goats are      well-fed: We have azaleas, (azaleas are poisonous to goats)      and ours have never bothered these flowers.    </p>    <p>      Other plants that may poison a goat are rhododendron,      chokecherry, death camas, Dutchman's breeches, jimson weed,      locow-eed, milk-weed, polk root water hemlock, cocklebur in      the sprouting stage and wild cherry or peach which is      wilted or frosted.    </p>    <p>      Goats are also susceptible to lead poisoning      and-since they'll chew on wood-it's best to use      non-toxic paint, whitewash or no paint at all on barns. Our      barn is unpainted cypress.    </p>    <p>      We have a 40' X 60' exercise yard made of 5-foot high woven      wire fencing. Goats will crawl under or through strand wire      or board-enclosures. If one persists in jumping a fence,      the cure is a Y-shaped piece of wood wired to her collar so      the leg of the Y hits her in the chest when she rears to      jump.    </p>            <p>      A doe must be bred yearly if you want milk. The breeding      season extends from October to February, with a doe coming      in heat about every three weeks. Gestation is five months      and the first kid may be a singlet. After that, twins are      most common, triplets not uncommon and quads or quints are      born occasionally.    </p>    <p>      A doe must be dry for two months-during which time      she is fed well-before kidding. Although modern dairymen      use the pressure method of drying off, we prefer the      tapering-off procedure. For the first approach; leave the      doe unmilked for a week, then milk her out and do not milk      again. With the second plan, we cut from two to one milking      per day, then one every other day, once a week, etc.    </p>    <p>      Though a doe seldom needs help at kidding, the keeper      should be nearby. The first three days milk-the      colostrum-should be fed to the kids; it's not good      for human consumption.    </p>    <p>      Most breeders recommend taking the kids from the doe      immediately after birth. This is done to protect the doe"s      udder and extend her productive milk years. We go against      this thinking and leave the kids with their mother for      about a week. After this, they're shut in a kid stall at      night and the doe is milked, but not stripped, in the      morning. The kids are left with the mother during the day.      She is stripped out at night and the kids given kid ration      and hay.    </p>    <p>      After six weeks the kids are let in with the mother for      only an hour after the morning milking. They're weaned      completely when about ten weeks old.    </p>    <p>      Unless you have registered stock, buck kids are of little      value except as meat animals. As such, they may be sold or      raised for butchering. At 4 to 5 months, a buck will      provide 35-45 pounds of dressed meat called chevon. The      flavor is similar to lamb.    </p>    <p>      We found that milking our first doe was uncomfortable and      difficult until we built a milking stand 16" x 42" and 20"      high in the corner of the barn. The stand has a feed box at      one end and a ramp at the other. The milker sits on the      stand, right shoulder against the doe's right shoulder.    </p>    <p>      We secure the doe with a chain hooked to her collar and      fastened to a spike in the corner, above her head. The book      says you can keep a doe from kicking by pressure of your      left wrist against her right hind leg . . . but we never      developed this ability. We fasten her leg with a wrapped      wire attached to a spike underneath the end of the stand.      If the doe is especially uncooperative the device can be      used to hold her slightly off-balance so she cannot move      either hind leg.    </p>            <p>      During each milking we feed about 1 1/2 to 2 quarts of 20%      dairy ration. Goats will not eat finely ground feed and      tire of the same food so we vary coarse-ground with      pelleted. In winter we add a little corn or hen scratch.      Too much corn can cause scours but a little in cold weather      gives extra fat to help a doe maintain body heat. Goats      will not drink stale or dirty water and a doe needs fresh      drinking water at all times, especially in hot weather.    </p>    <p>      To milk a goat, grasp the teats firmly and squeeze from the      top down. Use both hands from the start, no matter how      clumsy you may be. Practice will improve your technique.      Frequently pause to massage the udder: This will keep the      milk flowing.    </p>    <p>      Strip the udder by running the thumb and fingers from the      top to the bottom several times until every drop of milk is      out. Failure to do this may cut production gradually      throughout the lactation and can invite udder trouble.    </p>    <p>      Off-flavored milk is usually due to improper sanitation or      careless handling that allows bacteria to get into the      milk. When our barn needs cleaning; when wet weather causes      soggy odors beneath the bedding; or when a doe has eaten      wild onions, we are alerted to the trouble by the flavor of      the milk.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes a deposit builds up on the rim of the tea      strainer that we line with flannel and use for straining      milk. This can also taint milk so we've learned to never      reuse a filter and we replace the strainer as necessary.    </p>    <p>      Since odor near a doe can be absorbed and transmitted to      her milk, the buck must be housed separately. Poor health      can be another cause of off-flavor milk. Occasionally, an      individual doe gives bad milk and must be sold (this      happens with cows too!) or her milk may be strong because      of something in the feed. We've found that our Nubian gives      strongly-flavored milk if her feed has a high molasses      content.    </p>    <p>      Do not let this discussion of flavored milk alarm you.      Dairymen have much the same trouble with cows and it's      actually not really a serious problem with either animal.      You will find-if the question ever arises-that,      almost invariably, an unpleasant flavor is the fault of the      keeper and not the doe. A little investigation and care      should eliminate the trouble.    </p>    <p>      It should be remembered, however, that goat milk does taste      different than store milk . . . but, if you're like us,      you'll soon grow accustomed to that difference. When we dry      off our doe, we have to mix goat milk half-and-half with      the boughten variety to get used to the latter.    </p>    <p>      Very possibly the reason goats have a bad reputation is      that they are often owned by homesteaders who tend to be      careless . . , perhaps we might say lazy! Cow milk can be      bad-flavored but dairymen are forced to eradicate the      cause. They can't afford to be careless. Neither can we!    </p>    <p>      We follow standard dairy procedure and milk twice a day, at      not less than 10-nor more than 14-hour      intervals. Before milking, we wash the udder with warm      water to which is added a drop or two of chlorine bleach.      We then dry the udder, and our hands, before milking.    </p>    <p>      Strain the milk immediately and chill. All utensils should      be sterilized after use. Occasional clipping of the udder      reduces the chance of hair falling into the milk and a      hooded pail helps keep milk clean. You can also use a      cooking pot (not aluminum) for a milk pail. We use a      stainless steel mixing bowl.    </p>    <p>      If this sounds like rigid procedure, remember that dairymen      are forced by law to take all due precaution against      bacteria.    </p>    <p>      If the keeper will do his part, dairy goats are an amusing      and profitable addition to the homestead. Children usually      love the fluffy kids better than any other pet and it's      been said that "kids" and kids seem to belong together.      Goat kids are very playful and will appreciate a few old      tires or a box to climb on. Take care to have no sharp      objects on which they can injure themselves.    </p>    <p>      Young kids and cleaning the barn occasionally require a bit      more time but we generally spend about 30-45 minutes per      day caring for two goats. In return, the goats provide      nutritious and inexpensive dairy products (we recycle much      extra garden produce through them to cut feed costs) and      high-quality manure for the compost heap.    </p>    <p>      I know of no reason why you can't raise a goat or two on      your homestead for the same return. You'll even find, if      you breed your does to a quality buck, that the sale of      kids can provide a little bonus income.    </p>
