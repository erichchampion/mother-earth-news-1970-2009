                    <h5 id="byline">     by ELMA MAYES    </h5>     <p>      In our back yard near the trash burner I have what I call      my garbage disposal unit. It starts out being a hole in the      ground two by two by two feet. Near this hole I keep a      container of slack lime in a waterproof container. After      each meal all the leftovers, vegetable peels, lettuce      leaves, coffee grounds, tea bags, and even cigarette butts      are dumped in. On top of the garbage I toss about one cup      of lime and enough dirt to cover the fresh deposit.    </p>    <p>      Within two or three months, the garbage has completely      decomposed and turned into a good, loamy potting soil. I      then dip the hole clean, pile the dirt beside the hole to      allow it to sun and air sweeten and use the amount I need      for repotting. I use what's left again to cover the fresh      garbage. Eventually the soil becomes too rich for some      plants, and it's necessary to bring in a bucket or so of      new dirt for covering.    </p>    <p>      This is a very easy and sanitary way to dispose of garbage,      and I am able each year to save several dollars that I      would otherwise spend on commercial fertilizers and potting      soils.    </p>
