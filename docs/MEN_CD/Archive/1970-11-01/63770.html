                    <p>      Familia is a grain, fruit and nut combination developed by      the Swiss. Some friends living in the Bay Area gave me the      recipe and I, in turn have passed it on to      others-most of whom had never heard of the mixture.    </p>    <p>      Doing some research on Familia, I have found that a few      large grocery and health food stores stock it already      packaged. But some ingredients are left out, and it's also      so expensive, that many of us couldn't afford it. It's much      more inexpensive, and more enjoyable to make your own.    </p>    <p>      Supplemented with fresh vegetables and fruits Familia is a      perfect survival food, containing everything your body      needs to stay healthy. You may use it cooked as a hot      cereal, uncooked as a cold cereal, in breads, cookies, or      eat it as it is.    </p>    <p>      Originally, I intended to use Familia as a nutritious      supplement to a city diet, but if you're into backpacking      trips and mountain living, it's the answer for a perfect,      lightweight compact food.    </p>    <p>      Here is the recipe for a 15 lb. batch.    </p>    <p>      1 lb. oats<br />      2 lb. wheat flakes<br />      2 lb. rye flakes<br />      1/3 lb. soy flour<br />      1 lb. wheat germ<br />      1 oz. rice polish<br />      1 lb. soy lecithin    </p>    <p>      1 lb. sunflower seeds<br />      1/2 lb. pumpkin seeds<br />      1 lb. sesame seeds<br />      1 pkg. chia seeds<br />      2 lb. raisins<br />      1 lb. dried fruit<br />      1 lb. nuts    </p>    <p>      You can purchase the sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, rice      polish, soy lecithin and chia seeds at one of the health      food stores downtown. The other ingredients are carried by      large markets. If you live in Portland, I would suggest      Jimmy Corno and Sons, across the Morrison Bridge on Union.    </p>    <p>      The cost for 15 pounds? Around 12 or 13 dollars. Happy      eating.    </p>
