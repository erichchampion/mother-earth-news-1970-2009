                    <p>      As you'll remember, we put out an appeal for a LEJAY manual      in Issue 5. Well, no sooner had that number gone to press      than we received the No. 5 issue of COUNTRYSIDE. And what      to our wondering eyes should appear but the very address of      the Lejay Mfg. Co. So we rushed off an order for a couple      copies of their manual and hoped against hope that the      current printing would be as good as the old 1930-something      edition dad used to have.    </p>    <p>      And it darn near is (only the cover is changed, the      contents seem the same) . . . perhaps because the "current"      edition bears a 1945 copyright! When you've got a good      thing . . .    </p>    <p>      Now please realize that many of the plans and illustrations      here go back to the 20's or beyond. Some of the ideas are      outdated, the prices quoted are from 1945 and LEJAY no      longer handles the parts and kits anyway. On the other      hand, this manual is stuffed brimful of the straight skinny      on generating electricity at home . . . direct from the      days when hundreds of thousands of rugged individualists      did just that.    </p>    <p>      Wanna know how to build a 110 volt A.C. light plant from a      Ford Model T generator or rewind a Dodge G or GA generator      for home use or make an arc welder or an electric outboard      motor or build your own drill press or construct an      electric scooter or bicycle or set up an electric fence to      keep the rabbits out of the garden? All this and more is in      the LEJAY manual for only $1.50. If you're heading off into      the bush somewhere, have a grudge against the electric      company or just want to know how to set up a home      generating plant, this is a darn good practical handbook of      basic information. I know: I was raised with wind      generators and welders right out of the pages of LEJAY.    </p>    <p>      And once you've got that basic information combined with      today's technology (such as automobile alternators which      are much better suited to home light plants than the old      car generators ever were) . . . who knows just what you      might come up with. As a matter of fact, we hope to have      some interesting experiments of our own to report on one of      these days. For now, though, the LEJAY handbook is a good      place to start. We recommend it at $1.50 from: Lejay Mfg.      Co., Belle Plains, Minnesota 56011.    </p>   <h3> WIND PLANT INFORMATION</h3>    <p>      Wind power can be harnessed to generate electricity for      lights, radio and power.    </p>    <p>      The amount of power possible in your locality depends on      the average yearly wind velocity.    </p>    <p>      Wind velocities vary in different sections of the country.    </p>    <p>      Average velocities for your location may be obtained from      your State Weather Bureau.    </p>    <p>      Wind velocities are given daily by the Weather Bureau.    </p>    <p>      WIND POWER IS FREE.    </p>    <p>      The equipment for converting the Wind into usable      electricity is your only cost.    </p>    <p>      Be certain that the plant you choose has a power output      large enough to keep your batteries fully charged at all      times. To determine the size of plant you need, get the      average wind velocity for your location from your Weather      Bureau. Then find a plant with a power rating sufficient to      show a surplus of output over your needs within the time      limit of the proven wind velocity shown by the observations      of the Bureau.    </p>    <p>      Propellers used on wind plants are of the power type.    </p>    <p>      Propellers for direct drive are High Speed.    </p>    <p>      The speed of the propeller changes with the pitch of the      blade.    </p>    <p>      The pitch of the propeller is the angle of the blade away      from a position flat against the wind.    </p>    <p>      Proper propeller design increases the r.p.m. speed of the      propeller to 3 or 4 times that of the wind velocity.    </p>    <p>      Propellers are liable to be damaged if allowed to run in      rain, sleet, snow or sand storms. Therefore, all wind      plants should be provided with a positive shut-off.    </p>    <p>      Centrifugal force increases with the speed in r.p.m.      Gyroscopic action increases with the speed in r.p.m. In      high winds, these actions may cause the propeller to fly      apart, or cause the plant to run out of control, ruining      the generator. Therefore, all wind plants should be      provided with an efficient automatic governor.    </p>    <p>      Generators geared or belted to the propeller require 25%      more power to operate.    </p>    <p>      Direct drive propellers in combination with specially wound      slowspeed generators eliminate gears and belts. Therefore,      power losses through friction are reduced to a minimum.    </p>    <p>      Wind velocity is more constant at higher altitudes.    </p>    <p>      Wind electric plants operate more efficiently at constant      speeds. Therefore, wind plants should be mounted as high      off the ground as is reasonably possible; at least high      enough to clear all surrounding wind obstacles for a      distance of at least 150 feet.    </p>    <p>      An electric lamp connected directly to a wind plant will      burn out as the speed of the generator increases.    </p>    <p>      The amperage of the current generated by the wind plant      increases with the speed of the generator, but the voltage      remains constant. Therefore, the current generated by a      wind plant must be run into a storage battery or batteries.    </p>    <p>      Lamps can be used direct from the plant if all lamps are      turned on to the full capacity of the generator. They will,      however, grow dim during lulls in the wind, and brighten      with the increase in output due to a rise in the wind.    </p>    <p>      Voltage drop is loss of pressure due to resistance of the      circuit or load.    </p>    <p>      Line loss is current that is used up in forcing the power      through the connecting wires.    </p>    <p>      ©1945, LeJay Mfg.

Note that the      leading edges of the two blades are parallel 5 1/2" apart,      and the propeller carries a width of 5 1/2" for a distance      of 7" on each side of the center. From this point the blade      tapers to a tip width of 4" measured from the leadIng edge.      Carefully maintain the 3/32" trailing edge for the whole      length of the blade. Note the riser dimensions for      positioning the cross-section heights and widths at the      section lines "A, B, C, D, and E". All tapers from E to the      tip are straight lines and should be laid out with a      straight-edge. The best results may be had with redwood or      straight grained fir,    </p>    <p>      The propeller hub is a washer of 4" diameter welded to the      helical gear of the generator, or a cast iron hub selected      from the LeJay catalog.    </p>    <p>      The collector assembly "E," and the generator bracket "A,"      which includes the clamp "B," may be purchased direct from      LeJay factory, but may be home-made as illustrated in Figs.      1, 2 3 4 and 5.    </p>    <p>      The tower is four sided. The corner pieces are 60" long.      The pipe "Y" is 32 1/2" long if used with the factory head      assembly, but only 24" long if the head is to be home-made.      The length of this pipe is the only necessary change in the      tower construction to adapt it to either the factory head      or the homemade head.    </p>    <p>      The pipe support collars "K" are of cold rolled steel, 2      3/4" in diameter by 1 1/2". A hole is bored in the center      of each collar to provide a tight fit on pipe "Y," which is      a piece of 1 1/2" standard pins. Drill 3/3" holes through      tower legs and collars to pass the 3/8" x 1 1/2" square      head machine bolts "L" which are threaded into the pipe      "Y." The bolt holes are 3/4" down from the tops of the      tower legs then the lower bolt holes are 8" below center of      top holes.    </p>    <p>      The brass collector ring "O" is a tight fit to the pipe.      Saw a slit in the ring, and by spreading the slit the ring      is slipped over the several layers of varnished cloth and      the bit of electricians' tape which lies under the slit.      Insert the end of the weather-proof wire in this slit and      flow solder over the joint. Clamp the ring while soldering      to make it fit tightly. File the soldered joint smooth.    </p>    <p>      The lower half of assembly "E" is held in place by a 3/8" x      1" square head machine bolt which is screwed into pipe "Y."      From 10 ga. band steel 3" wide, form the clamps "H " Figs.      1, 2 and 3. The angle irons "R" are 10" long, and have a      alight bend, Fig. 3. Pipe "P" is threaded at the top, as is      pipe "Y," to take a lock nut cut from a standard coupling.      This nut holds the head in place.    </p>    <p>      The main vane has its lower support bolted to the top or      brush half of the "E" assembly in the factory job, The top      support is hung from the clamp "S. The main vane of the      home-built plant has both supports hung from "S" clamps,      Fig. 1. The "S" clamps are fitted to the pipe on which they      are used.    </p>    <p>      The pilot vanes on both plants are identical.    </p>    <p>      The pull cord on the factory job is anchored to the top      pilot vane support, passes through the pulley "J" on the      top main vane support, <em>through the</em> pulley "Z"      mounted on the "S" clamp of the top support of the main      vane (by means of a small bracket), and then is drawn down      inside pipe "Y."    </p>    <p>      The pull cord on the home-built plant is anchored to the      main vane top support, passes through pulley "J" which is      mounted on the top pilot vane support, through pulley "Z"      which is mounted directly on the top generator rest "R" and      then down through pipe "P".    </p>    <p>      On the factory casting of the head assembly stops are      provided at the open and closed positions of the vanes. The      home-built head uses a small chain "F," Fig. 3, to hold the      vanes in the open position. A tension spring connected at      point "D" on the top pilot vane support "W" holds the vanes      at right angles when the pull cord is released. The cord is      of 3/16" light stranded flexible cable.    </p>    <p>      The wiring diagram is clear. and needs no explanation. Much      of the success of the plant depends, however, on the brush      assembly described in Fig. 5. Adjust the wiper arm "N" to      give a good strong contact trough the ring at any position      and provide a strong flexible cable for the connection to      the generator from the fastening bolt in the insulator      block. This circuit is the positive shown is the diagram.      The negative travels through the generator case to the      tower and may be taken off tower at any handy point.    </p>    <p>      If you desire to run this plant with a governing propeller      there will be no need of a pilot vane. Cut off upper pilot      vane support "W" at a point 1" beyond where pullout cable      fastens to support. This portion of upper support "W" will      be used as arm for pulling plant in or out of wind. There      will be no lower support "W".    </p>		<p>   <strong> PARTS</strong>	 </p>    <p>      No. A-Cast iron generator bracket with clamp.<br />      Factory machined      .............................................................................................................................$4.95    </p>    <p>      No. E-Cast iron collector ring assembly.
