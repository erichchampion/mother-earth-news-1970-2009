                    <p>      <em>With a few hours of tinkering-and some readily      available parts-you can build your own...</em>    </p>            <h5 id="byline">     By T.J. Byers</h5>   <p>      Selecting the right spot for a windplant-or even just      choosing a <em>suitably sized generator</em> -can be      nearly impossible unless you know how much wind to expect      and from what direction it's likely to come. After all, the      amount of wattage that such a powerplant will produce is      actually related to the <em>square</em> of the wind      velocity ... and thus a small difference in speed can make      a big change in the amount of electricity generated. (For      example, a 15-MPH breeze will actually yield about      <em>twice</em> the energy that a 10-MPH puff does.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, there <em>are</em> a number of commercial      wind-monitoring systems available-and many of them      are excellent products-but they tend to be quite      expensive. In fact, I was pretty reluctant to spend the      $100 or more (in some cases. much more) necessary to buy a      quality cup anemometer, so I decided to build a wind gauge      and vane <em>myself</em> .    </p>    <p>      The two parts of the system have many similarities in their      construction, and can both be mounted on the same PVC pipe      stand (as shown in the accompanying photo). The anemometer,      however, is just a <em>bit</em> more complicated than the      wind vane, so let's start with it.    </p>    <h3>THE MOTOR/GENERATOR</h3>    <p>      The heart of my homemade anemometer is a small electric      motor-with permanent magnets and windings-that      can also operate as a generator. It's often possible to      remove excellent examples of anemometer-sized motor/      generators a from children's toys-after getting the      permission of the youngster in question, of      course-but the Radio Shack unit I've specified      happens to fit perfectly the PVC pipe parts we'll be using.    </p>    <p>      To turn the little motor into a generator that'll give a      readout proportional to windspeed, all you need to do is      give the powerplant "wings" to catch the breeze. A DC      ammeter will then measure the motor's output, and you can      calibrate the gauge to read in MPH.    </p>    <h3>THE HOUSING</h3>    <p>      The powerplant specified in the materials list will fit      snugly within a 3/4" to 1/2" Schedule 40 PVC cup reducer...      but you'll have to cut notches in the fitting's seat to      accommodate the wire tabs which emerge from the      motor/generator's bottom. A 3/4" Schedule 40 PVC coupling      can then be slipped over the motor <em>and</em> cup      reducer, enclosing the rest of the generator. Now grind the      tips of the eight-sided plastic fitting down until they're      flush with the 3/4" coupler, cement the unit into the PVC      housing with all-purpose glue, and seal the assembly with      silicone adhesive ... being careful that you don't get any      of the caulking on the axle.    </p>    <p>      To keep water from leaking in around the motor/generator's      shaft, cut a 1/4"-diameter washer from a piece of felt, and      poke a hole in the center of the material with a needle.      Slip the washer over the generator's shaft, and      <em>then</em> oil it with sewing machine lubricant. (Be      sure you don't get any oil on the shaft <em>tip!</em> )    </p>    <h3>THE SPINNER ASSEMBLY</h3>    <p>      Two bisected ping-pong balls serve as the "sails" that spin      the homemade wind gauge. After much experimentation, I've      found that the spheres are most easily divided by cutting      around the seam with a razor knife. Don't puncture the      surface, just make a progressively deeper cut until you can      split the ball by squeezing it gently.    </p>    <p>      The hemispherical sails are connected to the central      spinner by 3-1/2"-long sections of coat hanger. To mount      the rod into each cup, snip two notches in the lip of the      plastic-directly opposite each other-and glue      the coat hanger in place using general-purpose cement.    </p>    <p>      While the adhesive is setting, locate a 1-1/2"-diameter,      2-1/2"-long prescription bottle, and drill four 7/64"      holes-spaced at 90Â° intervals-into the      sides of the vial, at points just above the bottom. Then      bore a 5/64" hole exactly in the center of the bottle's      base, using the bottom's casting "tit" as a guide for      positioning the drill bit.    </p>    <p>      Next, turn the vial <em>upright</em> and insert a "sail      arm" into each of the 7/64" holes. Position the ping-pong      ball halves so that they'll catch the wind (either      clockwise or counterclockwise motion will do), and set them      so that each one is an equal distance from the bottle but      doesn't obstruct the central 5/64" hole.    </p>    <p>      Epoxy will hold the coat hangers in place within the      container but, before you pour the adhesive into the vial,      you should place your 5/64" drill bit (coated lightly with      oil so the epoxy won't stick to <em>it</em> ) into the      5/64" hole ... to keep a central opening for the      motor/generator's shaft. I just drilled a corresponding      hole in the bottle's top-to keep the bit lined      up-mixed up a small amount of fast-setting epoxy,      poured it in 1/4" deep, and then slipped the lid into      position to support the "far end" of the drill. After five      minutes of setting time, I was able to gently remove the      drill and put the as sembly aside to finish drying      completely. On the morning after pouring the epoxy, you can      attach the spinner to the motor. Just slip the prescription      bottle unit over the generator's shaft-the fit should      be snug-and test the device for balance and      squareness by spinning it. Slide it all the way down on the      motor's shaft, apply a drop of cyanoacrylate glue (Crazy      Glue, Permabond, or Eastman 910, for example) to the      <em>tip</em> of the shaft, and then slip the vial back out      until it's flush with the end of the shaft.    </p>    <h3>WIRE IT UP</h3>    <p>      Solder a 1,000 (1K) ohm calibration potentiometer across      the 0-1 milliampere meter's terminals... using only the      central wiper terminal (the lone one, opposite the other      two) and either of the remaining connectors. Now wrap each      wire from the "sender" around a terminal on the meter      (don't solder yet!). When that's done, turn the      potentiometer, using a small screwdriver, all the way in      one direction... and give the sender a spin. If the needle      fails to move, turn the control all the way in the      <em>other</em> direction and repeat the test. (If the meter      goes in the wrong direction, switch the wires on the meter      terminals.) A healthy spin should now produce about a      half-scale reading. If it does so, you can complete the      construction by soldering the wires to the terminals on the      meter.    </p>    <h3>CALIBRATION</h3>    <p>      A well-made commercial anemometer will provide you with an      extremely <em>accurate</em> basis for calibrating your      device, but you can get pretty close using your car's      speedometer. Temporarily mount the sender atop a five-foot      piece of plastic pipe-no glue is necessary at this      point-and have a friend pilot the family carriage      while you hold the spinner up in the wind. Have your driver      proceed down a level (and deserted) section of read at 25      MPH, so that you can adjust the control to produce a meter      reading of "1". Make a couple of passes back and forth to      compensate for the wind direction, as well as your car's      streamlining and speed inaccuracy. Then have your assistant      drive the car at 20, 15, 10, and 5 MPH so you can note      <em>those</em> readings. (If you prefer, you can later make      a new faceplate for the meter which reads in the correct      MPH.) And, once you've mounted the meter in the center of a      suitable board, your anemometer will be complete.    </p>    <h3>WIND VANE CONSTRUCTION</h3>    <p>      The weather vane portion of my home-made wind-monitoring      center consists of a "sail" which is connected to a rotary      switch that, in turn, is wired to a series of lamps      arranged in a circle. As the wind direction changes, the      shaft will rotate and touch different contacts, thereby      lighting corresponding lamps ... until it settles on the      <em>new</em> wind direction.    </p>    <p>      The mechanical components of the instrument are quite      similar to those used in the building of the anemometer: a      coat hanger, a plastic vial, and PVC pipe parts. The      wind-catching portions of the instrument, however, are      formed from steel rather than ping-pong balls. The best      <em>free</em> source of suitable metal to a discarded      <em>steel</em> beverage can. (Most drink cans are now made      of aluminum and won't work. However, all canned teas come      in steel containers ... as do <em>some</em> colas.)    </p>    <p>      Using an opener, remove the top and bottom of the can and      then cut along its seam with a pair of tinsnips. Before you      attempt to flatten the metal, snip away the "lips" where      the lids were joined to the can's body. The operation may      involve removing as much as half an inch from each end of      the container, because of the tapers rolled into the can's      sides.    </p>    <p>      At this point you'll notice that the steel <em>still</em>      doesn't want to stay flat. Don't despair ... the problem      will be remedied in short order. First, use the tinsnips to      cut the metal to the shape shown in the photograph. Then,      in order to strengthen the flimsy sheet, form three      lengthwise ridges in the piece by laying the vane on a      length of coat hanger and sliding a short section of 2 X 2      along the metal directly above the wire. The pressure will      create grooves in the tailpiece.    </p>    <p>      Now cut a straight section of coat hanger 12 inches in      length, and remove its paint with sandpaper. Once that's      done, fasten the support rod into the center groove in the      vane, using acid core solder and a torch. ( <em>Never</em>      solder in an area with inadequate ventilation, and      <em>always</em> avoid breathing the fumes formed while      heating the metal, solder, and flux!)    </p>    <p>      In order to avoid having the tail's weight put lateral      pressure on the bearing, you'll need to build a      counterbalance. I made one by filling the decorative      endpiece of a curtain rod with solder and plunging a short      piece of coat hanger into the stillmolten lead. (The wire      must, of course, be sanded and timed if it's to bond to the      lead correctly.) A number of other approaches could also be      used to provide the needed counterweighting ... including      welding nuts or washers to the coat hanger section.    </p>    <p>      Whatever approach you use, the tail and counterweight will      have to be mounted into the housing-which is formed      from another 1-1/2' X 2-1/2" prescription vial-to      establish perfect balance. Drill two 7/64" holes (one on      each aide of the bottle) to accept the "free" ends of the      coat hanger pieces, and balance the rods in the openings,      adjusting the length of the counterweight "stem" to level      the assembly.    </p>    <p>      The switch shaft will be set into the pill bottle in much      the same fashion that the motor shaft was mounted for the      anemometer. Drill a 15/64" hole in the casting tit on the      bottle's bottom, place the oil-coated drill bit into      position, and pour the epoxy in around it to a depth      sufficient to secure the tail and counter-weight rods.    </p>    <h3>MOUNTING THE SWITCH</h3>    <p>      I've found 14- or 16-wire telephone cable to be the easiest      material to use for wiring the rotary switch. Solder one      wire to each of the 13 terminals on the bottom of the      switch, but be sure to jot down the colors, <em>and</em>      their respective terminal numbers, as you go.    </p>    <p>      Now mount the switch in a 3/4' Schedule 40 PVC pipe      coupler. Unfortunately, the oval shape of the switchplate      to slightly larger than the coupler's inside diameter, so      you'll have to cut (with a hacksaw) a 3/8"-wide, 5/8"-deep      notch on each side of the coupler to provide clearance.      Furthermore, to reduce the friction of rotation, you should      remove the index ball located under the switch's metal      mounting bracket.    </p>    <h3>ASSEMBLY</h3>    <p>      Once you've finished the wiring and mounting and have      allowed the epoxy to set overnight, you can begin putting      the pieces together by threading the cable into the      coupling and slipping the switch into its grooves. When the      device is seated, check to see that the shaft is aligned      accurately, or wobbling and sticking will result.    </p>    <p>      To seal the housing, wrap electrical tape around the upper      (cutaway) portion of the coupler, and fill the recesses      with silicone sealant to protect the contacts from      moisture. (Don't <em>force</em> the adhesive into the      switch holes or you'll run the risk of hindering the unit's      operation.) While you have the caulk in hand, seal the      other end of the switch housing, but avoid getting any      material on the shaft or bearing.    </p>    <p>      Then, to complete the vane assembly, slide the      vial/tail/counterbalance body over the switch shaft and      down until it contacts the parts inside. Then place a drop      of cyanoacrylate glue on the end of the shaft, slip the      vial back out until it's flush with the shaft end, and      allow the adhesive to dry.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">    <h3>LIST OF MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      <strong>ANEMOMETER</strong>    </p>    <p>      (1) motor (Radio Shack No.273-213)<br />      (1) 0-1 milliampere meter (R.S.

Although you could use a number of different kinds of      lamps, I've specified readily available units that come      with attached leads to facilitate wiring.    </p>    <p>      Drill a dozen holes (in a circle around the wind velocity      meter) large enough to accommodate the bulbs, slip the      lamps into the openings, and connect one lead from each      bulb to the power source. Then solder the other wire from      each light to one of the switch's contacts. Refer to the      color code chart (you did make one, didn't you?), and      connect the lamps, sequentially, to the switch contacts. It      doesn't matter where you start, but you <em>must</em>      maintain the proper order. Finally, attach the wiper lead      from the switch to one leg of your power supply.    </p>    <p>      The wind vane can be mounted by teeing a second vertical      piece of pipe from the anemometer mount (as shown in the      photo), but be sure to set it a foot or so <em>above</em>      the anemometer to avoid having one device interfere with      the wind flow to the other.    </p>    <p>      Before you <em>glue</em> the wind vane atop the 3/4" PVC      stand, you must orient the assembly. First turn the vane so      it's pointing due north. Then just have someone check the      display to see which lamp is lit. Simply rotate the switch      housing (without turning the vane itself) until the north      lamp lights up, and then glue the coupler to the pipe in      that position.    </p>    <h3>PUTTING THE WIND MONITORS TO WORK</h3>    <p>      Move your wind vane and anemometer to different locations      periodically, and record-on a regular basis-the      readings you get at each site. You should note the speed      and direction of the wind at least twice a day aver a      two-week period.    </p>    <p>      Start by checking hilltops, and then move on to fields that      are unobstructed by trees, hills, or buildings. (If the      equipment is set farther than 100 feet from the meter and      lamps, use <em>at least</em> 18-gauge wire to prevent line      losses.) In general, a good windplant site will have      breezes of over 10 MPH three times per week or more. But      keep in mind that one 20-MPH blow will produce more power      than three 10-MPH zephyrs (remember the "square law" of      wind power?).    </p>    <p>      If you keep careful records, your wind-energy-measuring      equipment will help you to make the best possible decisions      about where you should put a windplant <em>and</em> how      large a generator you actually need. Furthermore, I think      you'll find that the attention the device will cause you to      pay to the weather will help you to make innumerable      <em>other</em> wise choices-concerning such things as      where to put the chicken coop or where to locate trees for      a windbreak-around your home.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Windpower enthusiasts will also enjoy      the article that appears on page 116.</em>    </p>
