    <p>
                <p>      An ancient Oriental growing method-that has a lot in      common with some of the Western world's "advanced"      techniques-can give you a better harvest than row      gardening... with less labor.    </p>    		       <p>      Feeding China's one billion people isn't an easy task ...      and feeding them well (as participants on MOTHER's tour to      that country last fall discovered is generally the case)      seems little short of a miracle! And even though the      nation's current administration deserves much of the credit      for this feat, the farming techniques that have enabled      land-which has been tilled for thousands of      years-to <em>remain</em> productive are, themselves,      just short of incredible.    </p>    <p>      Eighty percent of China's people, using methods developed      over centuries, are now involved in the most intensive and      efficient agricultural system in the world ... and many of      the vegetables that these farm workers-and their city      cousins, too-consume come from private family plots      of raised vegetable beds that are smaller than the space      needed to house a Western farmer's tools!    </p>    <p>      With the exception of areas containing such "water crops"      as rice and lotus (which require sunken beds), this      intensive gardening technique is used on almost every spare      inch of land. Entire fields of raised beds stretch to the      horizon, and there are tiny strips of cultivated earth      beside factory walls, city dwellings, and highway      right-of-ways. Some small gardens are even tucked in among      the rock monoliths of Kunming's "Stone Forest" national      monument ... and such "postcard-size" plots play a large      part in putting good fresh vegetables on family tables, and      often produce enough surplus to earn the gardeners extra      income at "free markets".    </p>    <h3>BACKYARD BEDS</h3>    <p>      If you think that Chinese intensive gardening-which      is designed to get the most benefit out of air, soil, and      water with the least amount of work-sounds like an      ideal method to use for backyard growing ... you're right!      Once created, raised beds are permanent. They never become      waterlogged, never have to be plowed, will "warm up"      earlier than soil tilled in the usual manner and thus allow      you to get a head start on spring planting and-when      one vegetable is harvested-can be worked and      replanted without disturbing the surrounding crops.    </p>    <p>      Additionally, because you walk on the paths between the      beds and never on the planting area itself, the earth      doesn't get packed down ... roots won't be damaged and can      grow easily ... and the beds will stay aerated (which will      help nitrogen-fixing bacteria create nutrients from air in      the soil).    </p>    <p>      Raised-bed gardeners never have to worry about accidentally      sitting on the plants behind them as they weed or harvest,      and-because such folks will have to fertilize and      water only the beds themselves, rather than the whole      garden area-they'll use less of both of these      essential ingredients <em>and</em> eliminate much of the      mud that can follow garden chores into the house. As an      added bonus, a raised-bed garden can be kept looking      wonderfully neat and beautiful with a minimum of effort    </p>    <h3>WHAT'S INVOLVED</h3>    <p>      A person could almost make a museum out of all the      wonderful hand tools that the Chinese have developed to      make cultivation easier, but-to prepare your own      Oriental raised beds-you'll actually <em>need</em>      only a shovel, a sharp spade, and a rake. (You might want      to add a trowel and a bulb planter to ease the tasks of      weeding and transplanting seedlings.)    </p>    <p>      When laying out a bed, remember to keep it narrow enough so      that its center can be reached without your having to step      on the bed itself. In China, raised beds are-at the      most-four to five feet wide and usually rectangular.      However, we also saw them formed into squares, triangles,      cres cents, or whatever shape best suited the available      space.    </p>    <p>      Peter Chan (a man who is among the strongest proponents of      this method ... see the accompanying sidebar) builds beds      that are four feet wide at the bottom and three feet wide      at the top, with a side slope of six inches. Each bed is      then surrounded by paths at least a foot wide.    </p>    <h3>PERMANENT PLANNING</h3>    <p>      Once you've completed your garden layout on paper (plan      well, as the whole idea is to make <em>permanent</em> plots      and thus reduce your future work), measure and mark out the      first rectangle by attaching twine to four corner stakes.      Then, working from the center and using the string as a      guide to keep the sides of the bed straight, turn the soil      one shovel deep (as opposed to the "one shovel <em>and</em>      one fork deep" preparation necessary for biodynamic/French      intensive gardening), removing weed roots and rocks as you      go along. (If you turn up a lot of stones, save them to      pave your garden paths.)    </p>    <p>      As you turn the earth, work in compost, manure, sand, lime,      or whatever soil tests indicate that the earth needs. And      be sure to dig a small, narrow trench between the base of      the bed and the paths, to catch water runoff and send      washed-away nutrients <em>back into</em> the bed rather      than onto the area where you'll walk. Finally, smooth and      shape the top and sides of the plot with a rake ... remove      the twine ... and move on to the next bed.    </p>    <p>      It's best to leave the corner stakes in-as Peter      Chary has suggested-because they'll help prevent your      hose from dragging across young plants as you water. Don't,      however, be tempted to shore up the sides of your beds with      rocks or railroad ties, as such supports would provide fine      homes for slugs and snails.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, not to <em>crowd</em> your vegetables when      you plant. In a bed that's three feet wide at the top, for      example, make only one row-down the center-of      such spreading crops as cucumbers, zucchini, and squash ...      two rows of cabbage, broccoli, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant,      peas, beans, and corn (you can stagger these plants to give      them even more room)... or four rows of garlic, leeks, and      scallions.    </p>    <h3>OTHER WISDOM</h3>    <p>      Another bit of simple "technology" has to do with watering:      In China, farmers always take care of this chore in the      morning, rather than in the evening, because they feel that      the cold "bath" at that time helps to stun and sicken      aphids, small worms, and other pests that like to dine      during the cooler part of the day. Although extremely hot,      dry weather sometimes makes it necessary to give the crops      another drink in the late afternoon, the Chinese point out      that plants are not performing photosynthesis at night and      thus don't need water. Besides, <em>evening</em> moisture      evaporates more slowly, and the "standing" humidity      attracts many insects, and encourages the development of      destructive fungi and mildew. Tomato blight, for instance,      often occurs when the soil is too damp.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, with the good drainage provided by raised      beds, your vegetables won't have to contend with "wet      feet", and-even after a heavy rain-you'll find      that the earth begins to dry and becomes ready-to-work much      sooner than would that in a regular row garden ... while      moisture is actually held longer beneath the soil,      stimulating root development.    </p>    <p>      To further discourage insects and pathogens, never put the      same crop in the same bed for two seasons in a row. As a      matter of fact, don't even replant a vegetable twice in the      same spot during a single gardening year, if you can avoid      it.    </p>    <p>      The extra crops that <em>your</em> raised beds ought to      produce may not feed a billion ... but you'll obtain more      vegetables, from a much smaller space, with much less      effort, than would be possible using traditional      row-gardening methods!    </p>        <h3>      WANT TO KNOW MORE?</h3>    <p>      Although the accompanying article provides an overview of      the philosophy and methods of Chinese raised-bed gardening,      it <em>doesn't</em> go into all of the intricacies of the      Oriental intensive horticultural technique. However, if      your interest has been aroused, there <em>is</em> a source      of more information available.    </p>    <p>      <em>Better Vegetable Gardens the Chinese Way</em> by Peter      Chan with Spencer Gill (available in some bookstores or      libraries or, for $4.95 plus 95 <em> cents</em> shipping      and handling, from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791) not only offers a      detailed presentation of the methods used by one of the      foremost proponents of the Oriental method, but also      features color photographs that actually manage to convey      the author's love for gardening. Folks who have a yen to      try this form of horticulture will find the help they need      in Peter Chan's attractive volume.    </p>
