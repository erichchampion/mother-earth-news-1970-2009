    <p>
                <p>      <em>Once again, our man in Kentucky garden-tests the new      introductions and offers us...</em>    </p>           <h5 id="byline">By Brent Elswick</h5>      <p>      The summer of 1980 provided nearly perfect growing      conditions here in Betsy Layne, deep in the Appalachian      Valley of eastern Kentucky ... and I was able to test an      <em>abundance</em> of exciting new vegetable varieties for      1981. As you may remember from last year's report (MOTHER      NO. 61, page 36 ... see page 148 for information on      ordering back issues), the summer of 1979 wasn't especially      conducive to gardening, at least not in <em>my</em> area.      The cold, damp weather made it almost <em>impossible</em>      to grow many such warmth-loving crops as tomatoes, peppers,      and melons. Well, mercy, did 1979's "failures" ever prosper      in 1980!    </p>    <h3>GET GROWING WHILE IT'S SNOWING</h3>    <p>      Things started to look up in the early spring when we had a      spell of fine, settled weather. I eagerly tilled the      still-chilly earth so that cool-season crops could get an      early start. Peas are usually the first vegetables to go      into my spring garden. And, while I didn't find an      <em>outstanding</em> variety of snow peas this      season-such as last year's Sugar Snap-there are      a couple that deserve mention. Johnny's Selected Seeds      offers Snowbiz, a tasty "eat-it-all" variety that grows on      tall, rangy vines (which need support). In addition,      Norli-sold by William Dam Seeds-isn't new, but      it's practically unknown ... and bears heavy crops of      succulent pods on plants about a foot high.    </p>    <p>      Without a doubt, the finest <em>conventional</em> pea      available this year is Maestro, the superb new legume from      Burpee. The plant is just about immune to powdery mildew,      and resistant to most other diseases as well ... and the      compact vines are <em>tremendously</em> productive. Maestro      pods are very large-they contain up to 12      peas!-and the quality is so good that my children      love to eat the green nuggets raw from the garden. Other      noteworthy peas for 1981 include Knight (from Harris      Seeds), and Frostbite... a tough, disease-resistant variety      from Gurney.    </p>    <h3>THE PLANTING OF THE GREENS</h3>    <p>      Around these parts, lettuce is started about the same time      as peas, and the most notable variety that I tested was      Deepred (Harris). The lovely red-tipped bunches of this      "looseleaf" are tender and sweet ... and they <em>stay</em>      that way well into summer. Montello, sold by the Jung Seed      Company, is similar to Deepred in flavor and heat      tolerance. Park's choice new looseleaf cultivar-it's      appropriately named Crispy Sweet-also has a fine      taste, and resists becoming bitter in hot weather. Folks      who prefer <em>heading</em> types should also try Vesey      Seeds' Queen Crown ... which will form solid two-pound      heads almost anywhere, and exhibits superb quality.    </p>    <h3>CABBAGE, BOILED DOWN</h3>    <p>      Cabbage is another crop that prospers in cold weather. As      usual, there are a number of fine new cultivate available.      Savoy Ace-the 1977 All-America gold medal      winner-has helped make the crinkled-leaf varieties      popular ... and this type <em>does</em> have a taste that's      somewhat different (and often better) than that of more      common cabbages. I found Savoy Emperor, brand-new from      Abbott & Cobb, to be as delicious as it is beautiful.      The Emperor is larger than Savoy Ace, and does particularly      well when planted later in the season for a fall harvest.      Another excellent "Savoy" variety is Novum, which is      available from William Dam Seeds.    </p>    <p>      Among the <em>smooth</em> -leaved cabbages, I found      Blueboy-a fine new introduction from Otis S.      Twilley-to be excellent. This main-season variety is      nearly perfect in all respects: quality,      disease-resistance, <em>and</em> productiveness! Johnny's      offers Primax, which produces heads that average a little      larger than those of Blueboy, exhibits a bright green      color, and is of very good quality.    </p>    <p>      Vela (Unwin), Widi (Johnny's), and Baby Head (Henry Field)      are three of the best <em>small</em> early cabbages to come      along in quite some time. Each weighs in at only a pound or      so ... but they're all perfect for <em>both</em> cooking      and slaw. Within about two months after setting out plants,      you can be harvesting good crops of each of these three      tender, tasty varieties.    </p>    <h3>GETTING AHEAD IN THE GARDEN</h3>    <p>      Of course, the cabbage family isn't limited to "Irish      basketballs" alone. Broccoli, for example, is among the      most popular of the cole crops. This year, Burpee has      introduced Green Goliath, a <em>giant</em> broccoli that      combines size with fine eating quality. Cauliflower, too,      is closely related to its green cousin, and Twilley's White      Contessa-one of the most outstanding introductions      for 1981-leads the field. The quality of this      heat-tolerant variety is equal to that of any cauliflower      on the market (try it smothered in a cheese sauce!), and      the plants grow with exceptional vigor.    </p>    <h3>TOMATOES? BETTER, BOY!</h3>    <p>      Just about every gardener loves-and      grows-tomatoes, and 1981 offers lots of good news for      fans of the red fruit. The George Ball Seed Company brings      us Sweet-N-Early, a newcomer which should prove to be      strong competition for Better Boy and Early Girl in the      "super tomato" class. Plant Sweet-N-Early, give it loving      care, and stand back in awe as the plants cover themselves      with huge quantities of three-to four-ounce fruits in 60      days. You can't do better for plain good eating ... so look      for this seed at your garden center. Another tomato that      performed exceptionally well in my trials was Red Chief      VFN, from Hastings. This staking variety sets large numbers      of delicious 10- to 12-ounce fruits over an extended      season. I also favored Agway's Roadside Red,      which-like Red Chief-matures in about 80 days      and produces an abundance of large, flavorful tomatoes on      big, sturdy plants.    </p>    <p>      Many gardeners prefer the milder flavor of pink tomatoes,      and-among <em>those</em> varieties-Park's Pink      Beauty Number 14 is a sure winner. It produces huge fruits      (one to two pounds each!) on rugged plants ... and the      harvest continues right up to the first frost. Other      interesting new tomatoes for 1981 are the easy-to-peel      Basket Vee and the pink-fruited Olympic, both from Stokes      ... Early Temptation (just great for growing in containers)      from Vesey ... and Hastings' Hasty Boy, the largest      highquality <em>early</em> tomato ever developed. For juice      fans, Stokes offers Veeroma, one of the very few      disease-resistant canning types. And, if you like      <em>yellow</em> tomatoes, try Moonglow from Gleckers.      You'll be rewarded with lots of eight-to ten-ounce fruits      of surprisingly good quality ... in fact, they're      <em>far</em> superior to the old standard, Jubilee.    </p>    <h3>PEPPER PROGRESS</h3>    <p>      Folks used to shy away from peppers because of problems      with fruit set, but the new varieties on the market seem to      have overcome <em>that</em> difficulty. I particularly      liked Burpee's Tasty Hybrid, which has come to rival Bell      Boy-my old favorite-for the title of "King      Pepper". If you live in an area with a short growing      season, look into Early Canada Bell from Stokes ... and the      same company's Italian roasting type, Super Shepherd. Both      mature quantities of tasty fruit within about 65 days after      the plants are set out.    </p>    <p>      Henry Field sells the most <em>unusual</em> pepper this      year. It's called Big Bertha, and the name is well-chosen:      Each plant bears several giant <em>eight-inch</em> fruits      ... and that's <em>twice</em> the normal size of sweet      peppers! Big Stutter, from Herbst, is a similar "giant      economy" variety. Among the other notable introductions, I      was pleased with Lady Bell (Harris), Delray (Abbott &      Cobb), and Grower's Big Pack (Twilley).    </p>    <p>      Eggplant is enjoying a well-deserved popularity these days,      and the gardener can do no better than Imperial. This long,      shiny variety-reared by the Petoseed      wholesalers-is best when picked before it is fully      mature. Satin Beauty, from George Ball, is another lavender      lovely. You can obtain seed for both varieties from many      garden supply stores.    </p>    <h3>AMAZING GRAINS</h3>    <p>      I'd hate to have to decide between tomatoes and corn in my      garden ... both are so darned good that I know I wouldn't      be able to choose. Fortunately, I've got plenty of room in      my growing ground, and I was able to raise bumper crops of      <em>both</em> favorites last year. One variety of corn      stood head and shoulders above the rest in my trials:      Atlantic, which is offered through garden centers by the      Niagara Seed Operation of Moran Seeds. Atlantic sweet corn      exhibits every quality home gardeners look for: terrific      taste, vigorous plants, and large ears. Make sure that you      give this main-season variety (85 days) a try ... you'll be      delighted that you did! Two good <em>early</em> main-season      introductions (75 days) are Seneca Warrior from Letherman,      and Bellringer, from Harris ... both of which approach      Atlantic in quality. Tendertreat (Wyatt-Quarles) is a good      choice for gardeners in hot, humid climes.    </p>    <h3>FIRST EARS</h3>    <p>      Of course, many people like to grow an <em>early</em> corn      so that they can begin to savor the tender kernels long      before the big fellows like Atlantic are ready for the pot.      Such folks will be glad to know that Gurney offers a      quick-producing sweet corn called Mini-Max, which yields      five- to six-inch ears-of <em>excellent</em>      quality-on diminutive plants. Unwin's Kelvedon      Sweetheart is also fully the equal of any other early      variety, and Seedway's Early Sumay is very large (and      <em>very</em> tasty).    </p>    <p>      Other yellow hybrids worth checking into are Tri-Gold      (Stokes) ... Kandy Korn EH (widely available) ... Supergold      (Willhite) ... and Florida Staysgreen EH (Abbott &      Cobb), And among the white-kerneled varieties-which      have increased in popularity each year, following the great      success of Silver Queen-are Herbst's Silver Dollar,      Abbott & Cobb's Lightning, and Meyer's Platinum Lady.      Sweet Sal (Harris) and BiLightning (Seedway) should be      popular among those who can't make up their minds. Each has      some white kernels ... and some yellow, too.    </p>    <h3>THE MELONRY LINGERS ON</h3>    <p>      Thanks to the dismal weather, my 1979 trials didn't turn up      a single commendable melon. But <em>last</em>      summer-with sufficient rain and lots of sunny      days-the round fruits really flourished! And      <em>none</em> of them did better than Herbst's Sweety Pie,      which had delicious flavor <em>and</em> a rich aroma that      perfumed the entire garden. It looks like Burpee's famous      Ambrosia finally has a worthy competitor! Sundae (also from      Herbst) tastes just about as good as Sweety Pie and has      larger fruit ... but the plants are not nearly so      productive. Folks who are looking for a <em>quick</em>      -fruiting variety should try Harris's Early Dawn. The      melons are elongated, dark golden in color, tender, sweet,      and aromatic.    </p>    <p>      Probably the most <em>unusual</em> cantaloupe for 1981 is      Pineapple, from Park Seeds ... a melon that <em>looks</em>      like a 'loupe but <em>tastes</em> like a honeydew! Burpee's      Venus is a honeydew through and through, but it reaches      maturity in an amazingly short 90 days. Among the      <em>nonhybrid</em> cantaloupes, I found Burrell's      Mainstream and Willhite's Perfecto to be of especially high      quality.    </p>    <p>      On the watermelon front, Gurney's Pineapple (yes, I know      it's confusing!) is a delicious fruit with vivid      <em>yellow</em> flesh (see, there <em>is</em> an      explanation for the name). I rate this six- to eight-pound      melon a best bet for 1981.    </p>    <h3>ENCUMBER YOUR GARDEN</h3>    <p>      Everybody loves cukes, and Agway's Roadside Fancy is about      as good as cucumbers get. The same could be said of      Herbst's Sugar Slice B ... a "burpless" type with a sweet,      nutty taste. Two choice new compact "bush" slicers are      Streamliner (Burpee) and Bush Whopper (Park). They're both      tops for small gardens or container growing. I'm always      glad to see a good new <em>pickling</em> variety, too, and      I found <em>three</em> premium preservers for 1981: Conde      (Unwin), County Fair (Stokes), and Explorer (Willhite).    </p>    <h3>CROOKNECKS AND BUTTERNUTS</h3>    <p>      Squash provides more food for less effort than any other      vegetable I know... and the 1981 trial winners were      especially productive. I liked Gold Rush, the All-America      yellow zucchini ... Harris's Golden Girl, another fine      yellow variety ... Market King, bred by Keystone and      available at many garden centers ... and Agway's Milano, a      fine green zucchini.    </p>    <p>      The <em>winter</em> squash that performed best for me is      called, strangely enough, Melon squash. The flavor of the      raw fruit does somewhat resemble that of a cantaloupe, but      it's when the squash is cooked that the gloriously sweet      taste really comes through. And it won't take many of these      three-foot, 20-to 30-pound fruits to last your family all      winter. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Thompson & Morgan had such      a small quantity of seed available this year that they were      forced to drop Melon squash from their catalog. As a      special favor to MOTHER's readers, however, the company      will make up special packets while their small supply of      the winter squash seeds remains. Request "Melon Squash",      and send $2.50 (postpaid) to Thompson & Morgan, Box      100, Farmingdale, New Jersey 07727.]</em>    </p>    <h3>THE BEST OF THE REST</h3>    <p>      Well, you're probably just about out of garden space by      now, but I've got a few <em>final</em> recommendations for      plants to tuck into those empty corners that always turn      up: Park's Candelabra Branching okra ... Darrow      strawberries from W.F. Allen, and Sequoia berries from Park      ... along with White Seeded Provider bush beans from      Twilley, and Seedway's French Horticultural bean.    </p>    <p>      And, if you don't have room for <em>everything, here's</em>      my "must try" list: Sweet-N. Early, Red Chief, and Roadside      Red tomatoes ... Sweety Pie and Pineapple cantaloupes...      Pineapple watermelon Savory Emperor cabbage ... White      Contessa cauliflower ... Roadside Fancy cuke... Maestro      peas ... Atlantic sweet corn ... and Melon squash. You'll      have a superproductive garden ... and good eating all year      round!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Most of the varieties listed in "The      Cream of the Crop" will be available through seed and      garden stores this spring. It you'd prefer to order by      mail, addresses for many firms that market to individuals      can be found in "MOM'S 1981 Seed Company 'Wishbook' Guide",      MOTHER NO. 67, page 46.</em>    </p>
