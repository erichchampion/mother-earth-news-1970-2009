                <p>      <strong>Plant your cold-sensitive vegetables      <em>before</em> the last spring frost with . . .</strong>    </p>            <p>      A cold frame is one of the best ways for an aspiring      gardener (especially one whose bankroll won't support the      purchase or the construction of a full-sized greenhouse) to      get a head start on a summer vegetable plot. In most parts      of the country, one of the mini-hothouses will help you      beat the final spring frost by three to four weeks . . .      and it can even extend the growing season enough to let you      get in an extra succession planting!    </p>    <p>      Cold frames aid growing plants in two ways. First, the      devices admit <em>sunlight</em> to enable seeds to sprout      into up-and-coming edibles. And, in much the same fashion      as do solar collectors, they convert solar energy to heat      ...in this case to maintain air and soil temperatures which      are conducive to growing. Consequently, the two major      concerns when designing a cold frame are to let the sun's      rays <em>in</em> , and to retain heat.    </p>    <p>      In keeping with state-of-the-art energy efficiency, we have      designed a passively solar, earth-sheltered, and      well-insulated cold frame. The box is built from a sheet of      inch-thick, toil-backed foam insulation board. Using the      technique developed while constructing MOTHER's Heat      Grabber (the article ran in No. 47 . . . see page 148 of      this magazine for back issue ordering information) and used      frequently in subsequent solar projects, we trimmed out 7"      corners from a 39" X 61-1/4" section of the insulation, and      carved 90Â° grooves in the foam so that the sides and      ends could be folded up without our having to cut the      exterior foil. (See the small illustration for details.      Note that - in order to achieve the proper angle      - the slicing tool must be drawn first along one side      of the half-round-molding guide, then <em>reversed</em> to      cut along the <em>other</em> side.)    </p>    <p>      Once the insulation board was shaped to the dimensions      shown in the large drawing, we further insured a good seal      by lining the joints - inside and out - with      metal tape.    </p>    <p>      Two triangular frames built from 2 X 2 lumber hold up the      corrugated fiberglass lid, and the 18" X 18" X 25" (outside      dimensions) sides describe an isosceles triangle. Once the      pieces have been mitered and screwed together, tack on      18"-long strips of ripple board, and connect the two frames      by butting 44" lengths of 1 X 2 between them.    </p>    <p>      The glazing adds additional stiffening to the lid assembly,      and both of the 19-1/2" X 50" sheets and the 4" X 50" ridge      cap can be cut from a single 10' piece of corrugated      translucent fiberglass. Attach the sheets to the ripple      board by drilling 1/8" holes in the material and sinking      No. 6 X 1/2" sheet metal screws - fitted with rubber      washers from aluminum roofing nails - into the      openings. Then pop-rivet the fiberglass cap over the joint      between the two sheets at the <em>peak</em> of the roof and      seal each fastener with a dab of silicone caulk. (See the      illustration for placement of rivets and screws.) An      additional application of sealant between the ripple board      and the fiberglass, and along the seam where the material      contacts the horizontal 1 X 2's, will help to retain heat.      To close in the ends of the cold frame's lid, cut out two      18" X 18" X 25" triangles of 3M Flexigard (or a similar      material) and staple the plastic - spacing the      fasteners three inches apart - to the ends of the      frame.    </p>    <p>      Though you could simply <em>set</em> the lid atop the box,      we decided that a trio of hinges and a handle would provide      a more convenient arrangement for opening the cold frame      during the heat of the day. Three standard hinges were      attached to the outside of the insulation box and the 1 X 2      on the frame, and the 1-1/2" screws and nuts were backed      (on the inside of the box) with 2" X 3" pieces of 1/8"      plywood. On the other side of the lid, we fastened a 1 " X      8" chunk of leather to the 1 X 2, using panhead screws, to      serve as a handle.    </p>    <p>      To put the cold frame to work, simply prepare a 25" X 48"      hole that's 6" deep, cut three 1" holes in the bottom of      the box for drainage, and set it into the pit. Then open      the lid and fill the container with about five inches of a      combination of the earth that was removed from the hole and      whatever fertile soil you prefer. With the ground and      insulation preserving a favorable environment for growing      and the sun beaming down in the daytime, you should be able      to start seeds safely three weeks before the last frost      predicted by your agricultural extension office. And once      the final freezing chill has passed, you can set out      thriving seedlings in your garden . . . ready to resist      pests and grow their way toward your dinner plate!    </p>
