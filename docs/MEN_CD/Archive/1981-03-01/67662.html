        <p>Any livestock owner will agree that opening (or ripping apart, as is more often the case) grain-filled bags in order to give your animals their rations can sometimes be a moming's chore in itself! However, I've discovered the <em>secret</em> to unlocking the bags. And my time-saving (and fodder-saving) trick is so easy that even an all-thumbs homesteader will find that it works every time!</p><p>If you closely examine the gunnysack, you'll notice that the stitches on one side of the receptacle are "flat", while the seam on the opposite edge of the cloth container has a knotty appearance. You'll want to face the fodder sack so that the flat stitches are on the <em>right-hand</em> side as you look at the edge of the bag. Once the feed sack is so situated, find the first flat stitch in the right-hand corner. (This string "unzips" the opening.) Cut this tie off at the corner and lift out the first few loops, using a knife or a fingernail.</p><p>Next, to open the bag, grasp the just-sliced lace in one hand and hold the opposite string on the <em>knotty</em> side of the sack in the other hand . . . then gently pull on <em>both</em> strands. If you're doing this step correctly, the seam should easily unravel.</p><p>This simple trick will help you to feed your livestock in record time, and will leave you with an intact - and thus useful - feedbag as well!</p>
