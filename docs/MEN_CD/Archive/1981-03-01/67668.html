                <p>      <strong>You can become part of a new and important      conservation project . . . one that will help control      insects around your home <em>and</em> -<br /> perhaps      - save an endangered mammal.</strong>    </p>		                 <p>      People who reside near rivers, swamps, lakes, or ponds can      usually expect high insect populations. But, if they're      lucky, such folks will discover that the bugs are kept in      check by local colonies of bats . . . which swoop out of      their roosts each evening and locate their pesky prey with      remarkably precise "radar" systems (echoes of their      high-pitched squeaks return to them whenever the sound      waves encounter solid objects). During the summer months,      bat colonies consume mosquitoes, gnats, moths, and beetles,      thereby playing essential roles in the ecosystem. In fact,      some of the little predators <em>eat as much as half their      body weight in insects each night!</em>    </p>    <h3>A WAR OF IGNORANCE</h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, however, these nocturnal hunters aren't seen      in the night skies as often as they were some 35 years ago      . . . because they've suffered, as many insectivorous (and      other!) birds have, from the effects of DDT. And though      this deadly pesticide has been banned from general use in      the United States since 1972, it's sometimes still,      illegally, dumped into attics as "bat control" (although      the poison probably endangers the <em>human</em> occupants      of treated residences almost as much as it does the winged      population it's meant to kill or evict).    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, as if residual DDT (and the continuing      "outlaw" use of the chemical) in the United States weren't      bad enough, bats have no awareness of national borders. As      reported in Bits and Pieces in MOTHER NO. 58, the Carlsbad      Caverns' bat population decreased from an estimated 8.7      million in 1936 to 200,000 in 1973 . . . and is still being      reduced as a result of the mammals' annual migration to      Mexico, where DDT is still in regular use.    </p>    <p>      While many bats fall to such poisons, others are prey to      the deeply ingrained fears and misunderstandings of humans      who wantonly destroy their roosts or carelessly disturb the      animals in their hibernation caves. The latter action can      be particularly harmful, because - when hibernating      - bats fall into a deep torpor and live off small      reserves of stored fat. If they're aroused unnecessarily,      the animals use up their "rations" too rapidly, and may      well starve in their sleep before the spring awakening.    </p>        <p>      So far, three bat varieties are on the U.S. endangered      species list . . . two more have been proposed for listing      . . . and still others are probably in need of protection.      (Being on the list doesn't insure the survival of a      species, but does provide some habitat protection.) Bats      that may shortly become extinct are the Indiana (      <em>Myotis sodalis</em> ), the Gray ( <em>Myotis      grisescens</em> ), the Hawaiian Hoary ( <em>Lasiurus      cinereus semotus</em> ), the Virginia Big-Eared (      <em>Plecotus townsendii virginianus</em> ), and the Ozark      Big-Eared ( <em>Plecotus townsendii ingens</em> ).    </p>    <h3>"BAD PRESS" VICTIMS</h3>    <p>      In the Western world, bats - although they're, for      the most part, harmless <em>and</em> may well be the most      effective natural insect controls in existence - have      long been feared. This human reaction probably stems from      the fact that medieval artists often attached bat wings to      figures representing devils and demons ... as well, of      course, as from the animals' connection with the Dracula      legend.    </p>    <p>      Other cultures, however, have long recognized how important      the tiny mammals are to the planet's health. Pre-Columbian      societies, both in Mexico and in Central America,      celebrated the winged wonders in their religions and      represented them in their artifacts . . . and - in      the East - bats are considered good omens and symbols      of longevity. (Though most small mammals have short life      spans, one bat is on record as having survived 30 years in      the wild.)    </p>    <p>      The fact is, nearly everything most folks "know" about bats      is wrong. The animals <em>don't</em> get in people's hair      .. . aren't aggressive, blind, or dirty . . . and have a      relatively low incidence of rabies. Just keep in mind that      they're extremely shy and intolerant of disturbances, so      <em>healthy</em> bats are very difficult to catch. Those      that can be approached are probably sick and should be      handled by experts or with great caution, because -      like most wild animals - bats <em>will</em> bite when      frightened.    </p>    <p>      Of course, sick animals may simply be victims of chemical      poisons. DDT, for example, disperses the animals from their      roosts, makes them ill, and often causes their deaths far      from the site of their poisoning. Furthermore, any      <em>survivors</em> of DDT spraying will be especially      susceptible to all kinds of viruses, <em>including</em>      rabies.    </p>    <h3>YOU CAN HELP</h3>    <p>      In order to encourage the establishment of new bat      colonies, an experimental project to provide special roosts      has been begun by the Center for Action on Endangered      Species. Artificial "bat caves" have already been used      successfully in Europe, but they're entirely new in this      country. The Center has come up with two bat-box designs,      shown in the accompanying illustrations, that are simple to      make out of inexpensive, rough, untreated wood. (Some      Europeans have had success with painted boxes, but others      feel that paint odors discourage habitation. This question      won't be answered until more information is available, and      you can help <em>provide</em> such data by putting up both      painted <em>and</em> unpainted versions, and observing the      results.)    </p>    <p>      The box's exact shape and size probably aren't important,      but the width of the entry shouldn't exceed one inch (3/4      inch is ideal). Bats can get through <em>very</em> small      spaces, and the use of a narrow opening will discourage      other creatures from moving in. Also, the dwelling should      be as tightly constructed as possible, because young bats      grow best where daytime temperatures are in the 80-90°F      range, and in environments where their body warmth is well      contained.    </p>        <p>      Very little is yet known about bats' preferences as to the      location of the boxes, but - according to the      information now available - the best bet is to fasten      them 12 to 15 feet off the ground on a building or tree      trunk. (A "managed" forest, where undergrowth has been      removed, is most likely a good area to place a "house".)      Make sure, too, that the roosts are positioned in such a      way that they'll receive morning sun and afternoon shade,      since inside temperatures <em>above</em> 90°F will be      pretty much intolerable to your hoped-for guests. In      addition, most bats seem to prefer sites that are      relatively well protected from the wind, and - of      course - your boxes will be attractive <em>only</em>      if located in areas with heavy populations of flying bugs.    </p>    <h3>DO IT NOW!</h3>    <p>      After a summer of feeding, bats mate and hibernate in the      fall, with the females storing the sperm over the winter.      Once insects become available again, one or more babies      (according to the species) are born and suckled for the two      weeks it takes them to learn to fly. (The males move out      while the young are being reared.)    </p>    <p>      In order to attract bat mothers, install your boxes by      early April. Sometimes you can expect guests within a few      weeks after putting up the shelters, but they may take a      year or more to make use of the proffered housing.    </p>    <p>      By reporting your successes and failures, you can      contribute to the small - but growing - store      of bat knowledge . . . and maybe help to preserve these      worthy little animals. Bat-box experimenters can obtain a      free reporting form, along with additional bat information,      from the Center for Action on Endangered Species, Dept.      TMEN, 175 West Main Street, Ayer, Massachusetts 01432.    </p>    <p>      Let's face it - in comparison to work being done on      behalf of whales, elephants, great cats, and crocodiles      - bat preservation may not seem very glamorous. But      humankind desperately needs these marvelous little mammals,      and our misunderstood bats can certainly use some friends.      Won't you be one?    </p>
