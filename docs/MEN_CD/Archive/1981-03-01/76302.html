                    <h3>Resistance Movement</h3>         <p>      Under still-chilly banks of brown-tinted, aging snow, slow      droplets of melt soften the awakening soil. Brave, bright      crocuses break the newly thawed earth, mild breezes compete      with the last of winter's cold winds, and eager      gardeners-won dering if it's <em>still</em> too early      to plant a few rows of peas-rejoice in the opening      scenes of spring's stately pageantry.    </p>    <p>      Occasionally-with all the hoopla about the new flower      and vegetable introductions from the "big boys"-we      tend to forget about the offerings of <em>small</em> seed      houses. Yet such firms are often quietly working to      <em>preserve</em> varieties that have never even been      included in-or have all but disappeared      from-the larger catalogs.    </p>    <p>      The <em>Abundant Life Seed Foundation</em> (Dept. TMEN,      P.O. Box 772, Port Townsend, Washington 98368), for      example, specializes in plants native to the North Pacific      Rim ... especially rare and endangered species that are not      generally commercially available. The foundation offers      seeds of trees and shrubs, garden and wild flowers, herbs,      vegetables (all open-pollinated and untreated), and sprouts      ... and will even <em>barter</em> for needed seeds, tools,      office supplies, or donated labor. So if you'd like to      plant a few Saskatoon serviceberry trees... or a stand of      thimbleberries or Himalayan blackberries ... or a patch of      Gramma Walters pole beans (perhaps allowing the vines to      climb the stalks of some Black Aztec corn), send $2.00      ($2.60 in Canada) for a two-year subscription to the      foundation's catalog. It's worth every penny!    </p>    <p>      Another outfit that specializes in uncommon "kernels" is      the <em>Prairie Seed Source</em> (mail 50 <em> cents</em>      for a catalog to either Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 1131, Des      Moines, Iowa 50311... or Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 83, North      Lake, Wisconsin 53064). The Prairie Seed folks are devoted      to the preservation of the prairie plants that      <em>once</em> covered ten states and two Canadian provinces      ... but which have-during the past 200 yearsbeen      plowed, paved, or poisoned almost out of existence.    </p>    <p>      Wholistic gardeners have developed a great number of      insect- and disease-control strategies... which include      organic sprays, companion plantings, and "everybody get out      in the garden with a can of kerosene" bug-picking parties.      But folks often forget about one of the most important      weapons in the natural gardener's arsenal: the careful      selection of resistant plant varieties. A few minutes of      research in seed catalogs can save you many hours of      backyard toil, <em>and</em> increase your garden's yield.    </p>    <p>      You could-for example- <em>fret</em> about the      fungus that's always laid waste your cucumbers in the past      ... or you could plan ahead and set out one of the "super      cukes" with resistance or tolerance to anthracnose, powdery      and downy mildew, angular leaf spot, and scab. Look for      Sweet Slice and Victory among the table vari eties, and      Liberty and Saladin for pickling.    </p>    <p>      Corn can be susceptible to a variety of insects, diseases,      and environmental stresses ... but resistant cultivars      <em>do</em> exist. Burpee's Honeycross is wilt-resistant,      and the ears are well protected from earworm and smut      damage. lochief-an All-America selection from a few      years back-is celebrated for its resistance to      drought. And Florida Staysweet, one of the extra-tasty      "super sweet" varieties, tolerates leaf blights and has a      lowered sensitivity to MDM virus.    </p>    <p>      Lettuce is one of the most popular garden crops, but many      backyard growers are disappointed when the plants bolt to      seed in the summer heat. Try cultivating Buttercrunch,      Summer Bib, or Green Ice ... and chances are you'll have      saladmakings well into the hot weather, and maybe even all      summer long.    </p>    <p>      Many folks also like to use peppers to perk up a bowl of      greens, but gardeners-especially those in cooler      areas-often have problems with poor fruit set as a      result of chilly nights. However, both New Ace and Canape,      finetasting peppers in their own right, <em>laugh</em> at      adverse weather ... while Resistant Giant Number 4 boasts      some immunity to tobacco mosaic virus.    </p>    <p>      Mildew often cuts short the summer squash season, but      Twilley's Ambassador zucchini and Zucchini Select (from      Stokes) are <em>both</em> resistant to powdery mildew ...      and the former also tolerates downy mildew. Plant these      varieties and harvest bumper crops right up until frost!    </p>    <p>      Almost everybody loves tomatoes, but <em>nobody</em> likes      the red fruit's too frequent companion ...      blossom-end rot. Sometimes-no matter how      careful you are about watering and working calcium-rich      crushed eggshells into the soil-half the crop of      'maters will show those leathery patches. But if you make      sure to plant a few Floramerica vines, you'll      <em>always</em> have some unmarked fruit: This tasty recent      AllAmerica winner is tolerant of (or resistant to) 15      tomato diseases ... <em>including</em> blossomend rot.    </p>    <p>      Save yourself some work, and choose resistant varieties.      And, this <em>summer</em> , take an inventory of the      ailments your vegetables are susceptible to. Then, next      spring, you'll be able to make even better-informed      choices.    </p>    <h3>THE GARDENER'S BOOKSHELF</h3>    <p>      The parade of fine gardening books never seems to end, and      two that have come our way recently deserve mention.      <em>The Complete Book of Herbs and Herb Growing</em> by Roy      Genders (Sterling Publishing Co., 1980... it's available at      bookstores or-for $8.95 plus 95 <em> cents</em>      shipping and handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.      Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791) is a      beautifully illustrated volume that is crammed full of      information about more than 100 medicinal and culinary      herbs. Genders brings a lifetime of gardening experience to      this fine work ... which-along with <em>Park's      Success With Herbs</em> ( $9.95 from George W. Park Seed      Co., Dept.    </p>    <p>      TMEN, P.O. Box 31, Greenwood, South Carolina 29647      )-would form a perfect basic herb-grower's library.    </p>    <p>      And, for all those folks who want the guesswork taken out      of their gardening, MOTHER has recently produced (and is      pretty danged proud of) her Guide to (almost!) Foolproof      Gardening. .. see the ad on page 117!    </p>
