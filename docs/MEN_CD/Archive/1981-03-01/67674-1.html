        FROM LEFT: Dried, hulled, and cracked nut (with nutmeats). . . . Both black walnut and butternut trees have ""deer-faced"" leaf scars on twigs. . . . The dark wood in the center of this felled black walnut is the heartwood that loggers covet. . . . This monumental specimen stands 103' high, is 18' 16"" in circumference, and was planted ? in Rhinebeck, New York ? by Alexander Hamilton!
