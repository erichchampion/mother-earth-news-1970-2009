                <p>      <strong>You <em>and</em> your young'uns (or <em>grand</em>      young'uns) will enjoy this easy-to-make propeller      toy.</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">  By Harry Sherrill    </h5>        <p>      Way back in 1920 - when I was but a whippersnapper      and aviation was just entering its adolescence - one      of the now legendary "barnstormers" flew a World War I      surplus biplane (a model officially called the JN4, but      more affectionately known as the "Jenny") above the      one-block-long downtown section of our small Oklahoma town.      Then he leveled off the aircraft and eased the man-made      bird onto a nearby pasture.    </p>    <p>      Airplanes were real novelties in those days, and by the      time I arrived at the landing site, the pilot had already      collected a good bit of cash from the more affluent (and      braver) members of the community for <em>rides</em> in the      flying machine. Being up in neither bucks nor courage,      however, I was content merely to study the plane from a      distance. I was fascinated with the propeller, and after      some close inspection I decided to construct my      <em>own</em> "aircraft" . . . modeled on that curved blade.    </p>    <p>      My first propeller toy - or prop-up, as I call it      - was just rough-whittled out of a piece of scrap      lumber, but it shot straight up in the air for a good 50      feet when "launched"! In fact, I use the same design today      to make the old-fashioned homemade "helicopters" ...      because the toy is simple to build, it's constructed from      readily available items, and - most important -      it <em>works!</em>    </p>    <p>      All you'll need to fashion this easy-to-put-together      hand-hewn rocket are a piece of lightweight wood, a      pocketknife, a cylindrical wooden rod roughly the thickness      of a pencil, some glue, and a marker. As you can see in the      drawing, the toy is made up of only two glue-assembled      parts: a propeller blade and a launching stick.    </p>        <p>      In order to construct the propeller, you'll first need to      find a rectangular scrap of lightweight (but      <em>heavier</em> than balsa) lumber. I generally use white      pine. Because the blade's shape determines how well the      aircraft will fly, it's important that the wood be of the      proper dimensions. The width of the whittled blade should      be a little more than twice its thickness . . . and the      length must be at least ten times the width. The prop-up      pictured here has a 3/8" X 1 " X 10" propeller. (You      <em>can</em> vary the size of your blade, but be certain to      maintain the approximate thickness-to-width-to-length ratio      of the foregoing figures.)    </p>    <p>      Once you've located a suitable wood scrap, measure it      lengthwise and mark the midpoint on both sides. Then draw a      line completely around the middle of the propeller,      connecting the two dots in the process. This line divides      the propeller into two five-inch-long segments.    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to begin whittling! In order to give the      prop-up its lofting ability, you'll need to carve the wood      into a characteristic propeller shape. With the block      positioned so that the <em>long</em> edge is facing you and      the inch-wide surface is on top, imagine the right-hand      five-inch segment of the blade sloping up and <em>away</em>      from you ... while the left-hand portion slants up      <em>toward</em> you. Sound difficult? It's actually very      easy to do.    </p>    <p>      Beginning at the middle line (which you just drew) and      working toward one tip of the piece of wood, whittle from      the top of one edge to the bottom of the opposite side.      Then turn the wood upside down and repeat the process on      the underside of the carved piece, forming a diagonal      blade.    </p>    <p>      Next, shape the other five-inch segment in the same manner,      but angle that section in the <em>opposite</em> direction.      Both sides of the propeller should be made as thin as      possible ... otherwise the blade will be too heavy and the      prop-up won't fly. You'll also want to streamline the      spinner further by tapering the edges of the blade and      rounding off the corners ... and, finally, by sanding the      whittled wood to give your aircraft a smooth surface.    </p>    <p>      At this point, all your tiny helicopter lacks is a      launching stick. Measure the propeller again to find the      exact midpoint, and mark this spot. Then simply carve (or      drill) a hole large enough to allow your launching stick to      fit snugly in the center of the blade. (You can use any      thin, wooden cylindrical rod for this part. I find a      nine-inch "all-day sucker" stick ideal for the task, but a      pencil will serve the same purpose.) Apply glue to one end      of the rod ... insert that tip in the propeller's hole . .      . and let the adhesive dry.    </p>    <p>      You're done! To test the prop-up, hold the toy so that the      blade is on top . . . and give the rod a whirling flip      between your palms. If you've launched the hand-hewn rocket      correctly, the toy will spiral high above your head. (If,      however, the airplane divebombs to your <em>feet</em> ,      simply twirl the stick in the <em>opposite</em> direction      on the next takeoff.)    </p>    <p>      The handmade helicopter can be flown indoors . . . but I      prefer to launch my propup outside, where it can soar as      high as 50 feet in the air. And I've found that by      releasing it at a slight tilt, the airborne toy can be      flown from person to person ... and can even be caught by      the stick, with a little practice!    </p>    <p>      Once you begin piloting this aircraft, you'll probably find      that all the potential woodcarvers in your family -      young and old alike - will want to join in the fun!    </p>
