                <p>      <strong>Barters and Bootstraps</strong>    </p>        <p><strong><em>From planning to harvesting and sales      strategies, how to start a backyard strawberry stand.</em></strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Biz Fairchild Reynolds    </h5>    		    <p>      Little cellophane packages of out-of-season, greenish-red,      sunken-skinned strawberries are selling at the grocery for      $2.79 per pound. I'm not exactly sure why they are selling.      In fact, even when strawberries are in season for a few      weeks early in the spring, the flavor of these shipped-in,      underripe commercial varieties is nothing to brag about.    </p>    <p>      While these sad excuses for strawberries are moldering in      the exotic food section next to prickly pear cactus leaves,      Carambola, and litchi berries, I am at home nibbling on a      tantalizing, bright-red, sun-ripened, lightly-sweetened,      partially-thawed, bowl of round little berries that went      from my berry patch to the garage freezer in a matter of      minutes-thus retaining perfect color, high nutrient      content, and flavor that makes you close your eyes in      ecstasy. Microwaved for a minute or two on high, then      broken apart in a bowl and spooned over vanilla ice cream,      or dribbled over hot shortcake biscuits, or merely tucked      in a cheek to slowly melt, releasing summer's sun soaked      flavor-here aren't many things that can top the taste      of home-grown strawberries.    </p>    <p>      Now that I have finished my sales pitch, I have to admit      that to get to the "Let's eat!" stage there is a bit of      preparation and work to be done-but the results      ...the results.    </p>    <h3>Doing Your Research</h3>    				            <p>      Looking through a magazine one day, I noticed an offer for      a now out-of-date strawberry catalog, and ordered it out of      curiosity. I'd been toying with the idea of starting a      backyard patch but had no idea how to start. When the      catalog arrived with dozens of listings of berry varieties,      I read each description carefully.    </p>    <p>      First, I eliminated those varieties whose claim to fame was      gigantic size or excellent shipping quality. The larger      berries weren't always disease-resistant, and the      commercial varieties promised firm but less flavorful      results. Several kinds did well in the Midwest where I      farm, and many of those were praised for their freezing      quality.    </p>            <p>      As my choices narrowed, I chose a fool-proof variety that      promised to grow in most climates, in most soils, under      most any weather conditions and purchased my fast batch of      Surecrop berry plants.    </p>    <p>      After several droughts and a number of floods, we made the      decision to switch from the dairy and feed business to      raising cattle and more profitable crops. It was clear that      during the several years it would take to build our new      business into a money-making venture, added income would be      necessary. I've always been a stay-at-home mom,      substitute-teaching, giving classes in wreath-making,      doing freelance writing. This was an opportunity to try      something new. With hundreds of acres of open farmland      around our home, there was room to expand our small family      strawberry patch and open a U-Pick strawberry patch.    </p>    <h3>PREPARATION Choosing a good spot</h3>    <p>      Preparation is minimal, but important. One important thing      to remember when raising strawberries is that they need      full sun. They also need a soil that will drain well. The      ground needs to be well-worked, preferably in the fall      preceding your spring planting.    </p>    <p>      Fall plowing gives the freshly-broken soil time to      continually thaw and freeze during the winter months,      breaking down the large lumps and sod clumps that will      occur from plowing virgin soil. It also helps rid the      ground of white grubs, which, if they occur in large      numbers, can do severe damage to plant roots.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you plan to plant an area that has been      previously gardened, the ground can be worked in the      spring-but berry plants need to be planted so early      in the year that the ground is often still too wet to do      much cultivation. Try to have the ground worked and ready      in the fall if you don't have a plow, you will need to      spade the area to a depth of at least 7 or 8 inches.      Disking or harrowing frees the soil from clods, and makes      planting much easier.    </p>    <p>      Our U-Pick patch is in a perfect location, as if we had had      it made to order. There is an old hay field near the house      which slopes gently to the west, providing excellent      drainage. Even after a recent three-inch rain, there were      only a few puddles standing amongst the plants. Berry      plants are quite disease-resistant, but soggy conditions      can damage their roots in a matter of days.    </p>    <p>      Locate your patch away from any tree roots. Tree roots      siphon off more underground water than you can imagine. You      will notice that any crop growing along a woods' edge or      near a stand of maple trees beautifying the lawn will be      much shorter and less productive than the same crop a mere      fifty feet away.    </p>    <p>      Soil should not be too heavy, although the not-too-finicky      berry plants will grow even in heavy clay. Sandy loam is      ideal-but the ideal is not always obtainable. Adding      barnyard manure (one thing we had an endless supply of) is      good for the patch-to-be, especially if applied a year in      advance.    </p>    <p>      We purchased a soil alkalinity-tester at a local nursery to      make sure our soil was suitable for berries. Any wading      between 5.5 and 7 is desirable (although in California,      berries are grown on soil with a pH of 8!). We had farmed      some excellent hay here in years past, so we were quite      positive the soil was good-and, sure enough, our soil      tested at 6.5.    </p>    <p>      Finally, it is a good idea to change the location of your      berry patch every few years. This decreases the danger of      diseases building up in the soil. Insect populations will      also be reduced this way.    </p>    <p>      Just remember: plow up a new area and have it prepared the      year before you actually proceed with the switch-over.      Planting clover or soybeans in the area before it is plowed      will add a helpful dose of organic material.    </p>		<h3>Deciding on Irrigation Methods</h3>            <p>      If you are simply planning on starting a backyard patch or      perhaps merely edging your existing garden with a few rows      of berries, then watering will not be a problem for you.      Berry plants need a lot of water, especially at certain      critical times during the growing season, and how you're      going to water your patch requires some foresight.    </p>    <p>      We were in a hurry to start up our U-Pick operation, and we      planted our plantlets before we knew how we would water      them. Fortunately we were a physically fit family-and      became more so by the end of that summer-and were      able, at first, to run hoses down to the berry patch. One      of us filled watering cans as fast as possible, another of      us carried them down the rows, and a third person did the      actual watering.    </p>    <p>      The plants were tiny, it was cool and early in the spring,      and the amount of water they needed was small. It rained      intermittently But as the rows started to fill in, it      became increasingly difficult to figure out where the      actual roots of the original plant were, making it almost      impossible to do effective watering.    </p>    <p>      We headed to Wal-Mart, and purchased several coils of      soaker hoses. After buying a used water tank from a      neighbor, we filled our pockets with quarters, loaded the      1500-gallon tank on the hay truck, and headed down the road      to the local water tower. For a quarter, you could buy 100      gallons of water. For under $5, we filled the entire tank.    </p>    <p>      We parked the truck and the tank at the top of the hay      field's incline, connected soaker hoses, laid them gently      on top of the berry rows, and opened the valve on the tank.      Success! Now I could weed the garden, do the dishes, freeze      the green beans-while cheap, life-giving water seeped      effortlessly from the black snakelike hoses strung out      across the half-acre. Every hour or so I'd have to haul the      hoses over onto the next rows, making sure they were      straight and lying directly over the berry plants. It took      a number of days to water from top to bottom of the large      patch, but the plants thrived through a number of rainless      weeks.    </p>    <p>      Farm chores keep my husband so busy that we have not yet      had time to hook up a more practical watering system. We      have two farm ponds nearby, but they are some distance from      the patch and to pipe from them would cost a lot. The other      option was to hire a bull dozer to re-dig the nearby pond      to make it more dependable in dry years. Either way, there      would be some cost involved. Add to this a pump and filter      to keep the murky water from clogging up the minute pores      of the soaker hoses and you have a very expensive      proposition. It will be the old technology for us, for the      time being.    </p>    <p>      However you decide to water your berry garden, be it large      or small, plan on giving it an inch or more of water every      week-more in sandy soils, less in heavy soils.      Berries are vigorous growers and need a lot of moisture;      foliage is thick and lush, and the berries are 90% water!    </p>    <p>      Pine-needle mulch and straw are good insulating mulches.      Not only does the mulch help keep the berries      clean-especially important in a U-Pick      patch-but the soil retains moisture and the ground      temperature remains even. The mulches also help discourage      weeds.    </p>    <p>      Wheat straw is a nice, fluffy, easy-to-spread mulch, but      its lightness makes it a helpless target of the wind. I've      spent hours mulching my patch only to have a strong wind      come up in the night and blow it all off. Once it a rained      on, the straw will be heavy enough to remain in place. You      can also rake some dirt clods onto it.    </p>    <h3>Varieties</h3>    <p>      I love to read the affectionate names that have been given      to strawberries: Sparkle, Cardinal, Jewel. Some, such as      Surecrop, Honeoye, Earliglow, and Sparkle are more common      and are found in many nursery and seed catalogs. These are      all-purpose berries that are successfully grown in many      parts of the country.    </p>    <p>      All betties are divided into the following categories:      early, mid-season, late mid-season, late season, and      everbearing. Earliglow is the very first berry to ripen,      and is a com mon variety found in U -Pick patches, despite      its small size by the end of the picking season and the      fact that it is less winter hardy. All other berries are      compared to Earliglow when ripening dates are listed, with      some varieties turning red up to two weeks later.    </p>    <p>      By choosing a number of varieties, you can make your      picking season last much longer. Everbearing varieties are      very labor-intensive and don't compare to the productivity      of regular varieties. They bear a little here and there all      year, with heavier crops in June and again in the fall.    </p>    <p>      Also note which varieties are susceptible or resistant to      various root, leaf, and berry diseases. Professional fruit      catalogs will give you this information. For a sampling of      available varieties, see page 86.    </p>    <h3>Ordering Your Plants</h3>    <p>      The more plants you order from a berry catalog the less you      pay per plant. It was actually cheaper for me to order too      many plants and give some away than to order exactly what I      needed. For example, 25 plants of the everbearing variety      Tribute, can be purchased for a little over $12, plus      postage and handling. That's about 48  cents apiece.      However, buying 1,000 of the same plant costs you only      $122-or about 12  cents each! If possible, get      together with other interested berry-growers and combine an      order. It can really save you money.    </p>    <p>      A really nice thing about ordering berries through these      catalogs is that you can decide on the shipping date      yourself. You could plan a mini-vacation around the      proposed planting date, or at least, be perfectly prepared      for planting the day before your order arrives. If      unforeseen circumstances arise, you can also call and      reschedule your shipping dare up to a certain point.      Usually a full week's notice is required if you want them      to delay your shipment.    </p>    <h3>READY TO PLANT</h3>    <h3>Receiving Your Shipment</h3>    <p>      You've selected the best variety for you and your area;      you've carefully chosen and prepared your patch site;      you've phoned in your berry order (or if you just wanted a      few plants, you've picked some up at your local nursery      center). Next step: planting!    </p>    <p>      An important ingredient to the success of your planting is      how you take care of your young dormant plants when they      active in the mail. The plants should be set out right      away, if possible. Plantings dates are March or early April      in our area, but father north it may be April or May. In      the south, make it February or March. The earlier you      plant, the better the plants will do, as they will become      well-established before the heat of late spring arrives. A      light frost will not hurt the plants.    </p>    <p>      If you can't set out your plants immediately, which I could      not do because of terrible, rainy weather-make soup      out of the leftovers in your fridge, get rid of the moldy      oranges, and-make room for berry boxes. We had three      big boxes containing 1500 plants in our fridge, with one      box stored on the front porch where I hoped it would be      cool enough.    </p>    <p>      There was a definite difference between the refrigerated      plants (moist plump roots) and the plants sitting outside      in the cold, dry air (light-colored dry roots). In the end,      they all grew; I treated them well enough. If you can't      keep them refrigerated or cool, try heeling them      in-setting them in a temporary trench in-the      ground outdoors. However, this causes the plants to go      through a second shock later when they must be lifted and      transplanted yet again.    </p>    <h3>Preparing the Plants</h3>    <p>      This is simple. Submerge the plants in a bucket of water      and let them soak up moisture just before planting. This      next step isn't required, but I took a scissors and snipped      off any long, scraggly or broken roots. This took very      little time, and it made it much easier to plant-I      had a neat little bundle of sturdy roots ready to spread      out in the holes.    </p>    <p>      Put 50 to 100 at a time in the bucket of water, leaving the      remaining plants in the refrigerator to protect them from      sun or wind or drying heat. Keep the plants in the bucket      submerged at all times.    </p>    <h3>Spacing</h3>    <p>      Strawberries spread by means of runners-baby plants      that spread from their mothers on little "umbilical cord"      stems. These plants take root and in turn become mothers,      to new babies. This goes on all summer, with each plant      making up to 15 or more runners. When you are planting your      tiny dead-looking little plants in the spring you need to      keep that fact in mind.    </p>    <p>      There are several acceptable methods of spacing berry      plants. In trying to cut costs, we decided to disregard the      berry catalogs' suggestions of planting berries 18 to 24      inches apart, in rows 3 feet apart.    </p>    <p>      We eventually found that it was best to set the plants 36      inches apart, in rows three feet apart. By the end of the      summer, there was barely walking space anywhere in the      patch. Now you might think that a mass of luxuriant,      intertwined runners would he productive and desirable, but      it isn't. Placing the new plants any closer than 36 inches      produces overcrowding, which seriously decreases production      and size of berries. A thinner row produces larger berries      because more sun is made available per plant.    </p>    <p>      Any runners that are formed during the fall are considered      weeds and should be cut off. There are even special      commercial machines produced just for this purpose. The      fall runners are too small to have a fruiting capacity, but      are, all the same, using up soil nutrients. In fact, one      drawback of one of my favorite berry varieties, Surecrop,      is that it is a heavy producer of runners. It spreads so      quickly that row rejuvenation must be done more frequently      than with other varieties.    </p>    <p>      The matted-row method of planting is another alternative      and is used by some commercial growers. It consists of      allowing more runners to "set," funning rows that are up to      two feet wide. Experiments indicate that the narrow-row      system out-yields the matted-row method; but matted-row      patches are more adapted to mechanized farming, which      reduces cost per acre. Also, with more plants in one area,      losses to drought, disease, severe winters, etc., are not      as tragic.    </p>    <p>      As the runners grow and spread, try to move them-they      don't root right away-back into the rows so that a      walking path remains. If you have too many, as I did, find      a friend who needs some plants, and either sell them or      give them away.    </p>    <h3>Into the Ground</h3>    <p>      This is one area that all berry specialists, catalogs,      articles, and direction booklets agree on-in fact,      there is always a helpful life sketch alongside the berry      information, showing the "too deep," "too shallow," and      "just right" level at which to plant your berries. The      roots need to be completely covered-but the crown      cannot be, or the entire plant will rot. You must take a      little extra time to do this right, or all of your time      will be wasted. I like to dig a hole then make a conical      mound of dirt in the middle of it. I set the plant on top      of this mound, spread the roots out evenly, and train them      down the sides of the "mountain." Then I fill the hole in      with good din, press firmly, and check to make sure the      crown (the fat little bump just above the roots) is      showing. After watering, make sure the roots are still      covered. If your dirt is soft, the water may wash away some      of your soil. Exposed roots will also kill the plant.    </p>        <p>      Planting berries in black plastic or spun bonded fabric      covers is becoming popular, and there are many advantages      to this method: few weeds, conserved moisture, clean      berries, earlier harvests. To plant, poke holes in the      plastic at proper intervals and carefully insert your      plant. However, doing it on a large scale would be      expensive and watering would not be a simple task.    </p>    <h3>AFTER-PLANTING CARE<br />      Blossom-Snipping</h3>    <p>      This is such a gloomy activity that some folks can't bring      themselves to do it. Your new plants have grown large and      lush. They are healthy, strong, and full of vigor. And now      they are blossoming; pretty white blooms spread across your      patch like a flurry of summer snowflakes ...and you must      pick them all off. De-blooming actually allows the plants      to grow much faster and produce more runners for a good      picking bed next spring. If the plant tries to form berries      so soon after planting, its energy will be sapped and its      overall growth will slow. Of course, you can leave a few      plants blooming to make some berries if you just can't wait      until next year, but you will notice the difference in size      between the berry-making plants and the runner-making      plants. I take a small scissors, walking up and down the      rows every few days, snipping off the entire blossom stalk.      Berries blossom over several days, so this has to be done      several times.    </p>    <h3>Fertilizer</h3>    <p>      I've made the mistake of putting too much cow manure on my      plants-they were the tallest, most lush, bushiest,      most absolutely beautiful plants you ever saw. It was like      a jungle, and I was showing everyone who came by my success      in berry growing.    </p>    <p>      But I hardly got a berry. Those that did form succumbed to      the gray mold, a disease that attacks berries, especially      in cool damp conditions. From this embarrassing experience,      I learned the hard way that too much fertilizer can be more      harmful than too little.    </p>    <p>      A good time to fertilize, if you really think the plants      need it (An 8-8-8 or 10-10-10 variety, but remember, they      grow well under most conditions), is in early fall, as this      is the time that the fruit buds, which determine the spring      crop, are developing.    </p>    <h3>Spraying</h3>    <p>      You can obtain a Home Fruit Spray Schedule from your local      extension office. It helps you determine what treatments      may be necessary to care for berry plants in your      particular area. Gray mold was the only serious disease      problem I've ever encountered in my patch, and this was      greatly reduced by using an electric weed-trimmer and      removing thick foliage that was shading berries underneath.      For this and other foliage diseases, benomyl and captan can      be alternately sprayed, unless you're committed to organic      growing.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>Our Favorite Varieties</h3>    <p>      A small sampling of the dozens of strawberry varieties      available for purchasing:    </p>    <p>      Jewel-I grow this elongated ruby-red late-season berry in      my U-pick patch and it is an absolute beauty. It is quite      firm, but not hard, very sweet, and a good keeper.<br />      Sparkle-This is the berry for jam making. It is a softer      berry, so not good for commercial use, but the berries have      a super flavor.    </p>    <p>      Redchief-This variety is a medium-sized and excellent      for freezing. It has been a leading U-Pick variety in the      Midwest and in the East.    </p>    <p>      Lateglow-Here is a very large and very late berry,      recommended for U-Pick patches. Good for freezing.    </p>    <p>      Tribute-This is an everbearing variety that produces a fair      crop in June, but a crop of large berries in the fall.    </p>    <p>      All-Star-This light-colored berry with a good shelf-life      for stand operators is a favorite of my husband.    </p>    <p>      Guardian-Another very popular variety, this late-midseason      berry has excellent flavor, stores well, and is glossy and      large.    </p>    <p>      Cardinal-As the name implies, a large, vivid red berry that      is a prominent commercial variety in the south-central      states.    </p>		</div>    <h3>Mulching</h3>    <p>      A nice covering of mulch to help over-winter your patch is      mandatory in the northern states. It is recommended in most      others. Before night-time temperatures reach 20 degrees or      below, apply about 3 inches of straw, pine needles, or      marsh grass. Some authorities suggest adding another foot      of mulch once the ground freezes hard. The mulch helps      maintain an even ground temperature and prevents the      constant heaving of unprotected plants as the ground      continually freezes and thaws. Leave mulch in place until      early spring, when the plants show their first signs of      growth. Then, push the mulch into the rows to help in      keeping the beds dean. This provides a nice path for U-Pick      customers to walk on and helps keep the berries from being      splattered with mud during a rain.    </p>    <h3>Birds</h3>    <p>      This is a problem you are very likely to encounter. Once      birds discover that there are red ripe berries for the      having, you will most likely have unwanted guests until the      season is over. One quaint solution is to scatter      red-painted pebbles throughout your patch before the      berries actually ripen. The idea is that birds will peck at      the stones and quickly lose interest in your strawberries.    </p>    <p>      Other solutions include laying netting over your patch      (convenient if your patch is a little one), and hanging up      those big yellow "scary eyeballs" here and there around      your patch. But putting them up after the patch has been      discovered is practically useless, which we found out after      a serious invasion of cedar waxwings descended upon our      ripening berry patch. They ignored the scary ball, a fake      cat, a garden hose "snake," lawn chairs, and even us! They      are a fairly tame bird anyway, and being fruit-lovers, the      temptation of big ripe Surecrop berries was enough to make      them throw caution to the wind and attack, even while we      stood within yards of the birds, throwing stuff at them!      After eating all the red berries, they started in on the      pinks and whites. In the end, they were even pecking holes      in the green ones.    </p>    <p>      You can order a variety of sophisticated bird scarers from      catalogs. One machine fires shots at irregular intervals      from 1 to 30 minutes apart. Another, the Bird-X-Peller,      emits actual bird distress cries from speakers. You can      also purchase metal tape that blows in the wind to scare      off would-be diners. There is also a deer repellent      available.    </p>    <h3>Time to Pick</h3>    <p>      This is the moment you've been waiting for. You've set out      your plants, cared for them through the spring, summer, and      fall. You've uncovered them in this their second spring,      and have watched as leaves unfurled and turned a rich and      healthy green. This time, the buds that have burst into      bloom are allowed to remain. And by May or June, depending      on your growing season or your berry variety, you are      eagerly watching little green berries begin to turn white,      then pink, and then-RIPE! You've done it! You've      successfully grown a patch of delectable, healthful,      freezable, profitable strawberries. Reach down and pick the      biggest one you can find. Now, pop it into your mouth. This      is your reward.    </p>    <p>      As you continue to pick your crop, remember that it is best      to pick in the cool of the morning. If picked at the end of      the day, the berries will darken and age more quickly.      Don't stack your berries over a few inches deep in your      container. And never wash the berries until just before      you're ready to eat them. Damp berries spoil quickly.    </p>    <h3>Fall Care</h3>    <p>      No, you're not done for the year. Once the berries are      finished producing and you have harvested all of your      berries, get out the mower. Set the blade on a high      setting, so as not to damage the plant crowns, and mow off      all the aging foliage. This will help control disease. Keep      watering your plants. Remember that early fail is the      plant's fruit-bud production period. Even in winter, if it      is exceptionally dry, watering is important. And don't      forget to mulch for the winter.    </p>    <p>      Fall plantings are possible. A friend of minutes has great      success with planlets that he dug from my overcrowded patch      and set out in late September. He does this every couple of      years, and says that because of the growth in the fall, and      the early start they get in the spring, he gets quite a      good crop of berries from them. If you do plant in the      fall, use closer spacing.    </p>    <h3>Rejuvenating Your Patch</h3>    <p>      Some folks never bother to do this. They either are      satisfied with increasingly smaller berries, or else they      allow their patch to eventually die out. You can leave your      patch undisturbed for up to five years and stiff have      acceptable harvests, but if you are attempting to sell your      berries to the public, you really should redo your patch      every few years. One method that we have tried and found to      be quite simple is to till up the original rows of the      patch, leaving only a narrow strip of new runners in      between. By next year, these remaining plants will have      spread, and you will have brand new mother plants. Some      folks find it easier to simply order a new batch of plants      and start over in a new, weed-free area, especially if you      have let the grass get a foothold between your plants.    </p>    <h3>Hints for U-Pick Operations</h3>    <p>      Opening a patch for community picking is a pleasant way to      make money. Although the profit margin is not incredibly      large-you may be able to clear several thousand      dollars per acre-a public berry patch is a good way      to meet neighbors and discover other products folks would      be interested in buying from you-straw bales, cut      flowers, crafts.    </p>    <p>      Before letting anyone set foot on your property, contact      your insurance agent. You should be able to get a      by-the-month insurance rate which will protect you in case      of an injury occurring on your property. A sign saying "Not      responsible for injuries or damages" is of no real value if      someone decides to sue though the chances of customer      injury are small.    </p>    <p>      You will need to set a price per pound on your berries.      Check around to see if there are other local berry sellers      and find what they are asking. In our area, you can get 65      to 70  cents per pound. A friend in northwest Pennsylvania      asks four dollars for a six-pound container, which is about      the same price per pound. To estimate how much money you      might make, count on each berry plant, or each foot of row,      to produce about 1 1/2 quarts.    </p>    <p>      Advertise your patch heavily the first season or two until      folks realize that you are in the area. Announce that your      patch will be ready for picking in about a week-end      then hope that the weather cooperates. This takes some      careful judgment on your part, and you may not be      completely accurate. Install an answering machine to take      the myriad phone calls you will receive from interested      folks asking, "When?" "Where?" "How much?" Put up road      signs at important junctions such as major highways,      intersections, and businesses that are relatively close by.      Be prepared to have a sign or two stolen.    </p>    <p>      Making a wooden carrier for U-Pickers is a good idea.      Design the floor so that it will hold the low cardboard      boxes that canned vegetables, alcoholic beverages, etc.,      are shipped in. Many stores will save these for you if you      ask. When the berries are picked, the canon is simply      lifted out of the carrier. With this method, there is no      need to squash berries by dumping them into another      container. Berry baskets may be ordered from the fruit      catalogs for about 25  cents each, or about $60 for a case      lot of 500.    </p>    <p>      Purchase small vinyl flags for customers to move along the      rows as they pick, planting the flag wherever they have      left off. One problem with UPickers is that they are after      the biggest and easiest-to-reach berries. You may want to      put up a "Please Pick Clean!" sign and try to gently get      this message across to your customers.    </p>    <p>      Be prepared for sales with a cash box, calculator, good      scales, paper and pen. You might also display other items      for sale-recipe sheers, magnets, crags, booklets,      birdhouses, or other kinds of garden produce.    </p>    <p>      Yes, you will have customers. A lot of older folks remember      picking berries when they were young and enjoy the outdoor      activity on a pleasant spring day. They will bring their      grandchildren.    </p>    <p>      Remember-you have an excellent product. You rarely      meet a soul who doesn't appreciate fresh strawberries, and      at under seventy  cents a pound, your merchandise is quite a      deal.    </p>    <p>      Let the berries begin!    </p>
