                           <h5 id="byline">by LITTLE GEORGE HEATH</h5>       <p>      It all began when I read MOTHER NO. 3 and decided I'd like      an old-time sheep wagon for a home. Since I knew there were      quite a few of the sturdy relics abandoned here in rural      eastern Montana, I started driving around in the country      and asking farmer friends. Half a year's search turned up      an old wooden-wheeled model which I could have free if I'd      haul it away. Then I met Lynda and we decided the wagon      looked big enough for two, so we got to work fixing it up.    </p>    <p>      We took off the old roof, exposing the beams, and      re-covered the top with a heavy handwoven rug. Over this      went new 18-ounce waterproof canvas, attached with strips      of discarded inner tubes, so that on calm summer nights we      could fold it back and sleep under the stars. Then we      patched a few cracks, made a double canvas door, bought      half a ton of coal, cleaned out our wood-burning stove and      oven and settled in for the winter.    </p>    <p>      We lived on a farm which we rented with friends, ate with      the others in the farmhouse and slept in our wagon at      night. The rugged roof and wood-burning stove kept us      comfortable (sometimes even too warm). Then, in the course      of our first "sheep wagon winter", it struck us that the      next logical step would be to go ahead and herd some sheep.      We sent out inquiries and-to our      surprise-landed a job which started April 1, during      lambing time.    </p>    <p>      In March we painted our traveling home, took off the rug      and remounted the wagon on an old truck frame with wooden      spokes and rubber wheels. (Look, a front porch!) Then we      licensed our rig, loaded up and headed for the new job. Our      traveling speed was between 30 and 40 mph . . . with a      short break for the installation of taillights, after we      got fined $25.00 for not having any. On March 31, all of      us-including horse, cat, dog and three      goats-arrived at our destination.    </p>    <p>      The flock had already been sheared before we came, and on      April 1 we began 21 days of lambing. "Sheep are born trying      to die," Lynda's father had told us. We learned the truth      of that statement right at the start . . . because woollies      have the least maternal instinct of any critter I've dealt      with. They're always having more lambs than they've got      milk for, losing track of their babies, rejecting their      lambs (sometimes killing them) and generally refusing any      assistance you may try to give them.    </p>    <p>      My main job was to walk the yard where the 1,200 ewes were      penned up and watch for newborn young. When I spotted one I      picked it up, found the right mother and used the baby to      lure her into the barn. There the dams and their offspring      were kept in small pens called "jugs" and watched and      helped for a few days.    </p>    <p>      Oftentimes, when I was carrying a lamb to a jug, a ewe that      was about to give birth would butt the mother and all      others out of the way and claim the newborn for herself. We      called these funny troublemakers "Grannies". You could tell      the real new mother by the bloody mucus hanging from her      bottom . . . and frequently you had to hunt her down, catch      her and force her into the jug with her youngster or      youngsters. (Most often it was "youngsters"-twins or      triplets-since the sheep I work with are bred to      Swiss-Finn bucks which get a high percentage of multiple      births.)    </p>    <p>      It can be complicated trying to decide which baby is whose      when ewes drop their lambs at nearly the same time. This is      a problem especially for the man who's on duty at night,      when the flock is barned up. In the middle of lambing, 50      would sometimes give birth on one shift.    </p>    <p>      Lambs that end up without mothers are called "bums" and      must be bottle fed. Sometimes, though, if we had a      motherless young'un and a bereaved dam with good milk, we'd      try putting the two together. That meant skinning the dead      lamb, putting its "jacket" on the orphan and rubbing the      live baby's face and legs with the liver. Sounds bloody,      but most of the ewes were fooled and would accept their      foster children after a while.    </p>    <p>      Bet you didn't know that sheep are born with long tails!      All our lambs lost them after a few days of life, and the      males were made into wethers. I liked lambing, but didn't      care much for the docking and castrating . . . even though      both jobs are now done with stiff rubber bands and      not-as they used to be-with a knife and the      teeth. We then branded the ewes and young with painted      numbers and turned them out in small groups to nearby      pastures. The lambs and sheared sheep are very vulnerable      to cold weather and we lost 5 to 8% in a bad spring      snowstorm . . . the worst loss of this kind my boss had      suffered in 35 years.    </p>    <p>      On May 4 we moved out to the summer range with half the      sheep, which were trucked the 30 miles there. A few weeks      later the rest were brought out by trail. Our job was to      watch 1,200 ewes and their lambs-called a      "band"-on a 6,000-acre pasture . . . rolling land      with some big open areas and some steeper, higher hills      from which we could see for miles.    </p>    <p>      We located our sheep camp in a small valley surrounded by      three of those high, plateau-like hills. There was one tree      on the land, and various waterholes, including a big      reservoir where we swam, bathed and planted our garden. We      pitched a tipi beside our wagon for extra room and shade,      and for our summer visitors. Our food was cooled with a      propane refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Because our pasture was "sheeptight" (surrounded by a      six-wire fence) I didn't have to stay with the band all      day. I rose before sunup and walked or rode around the area      looking for coyotes. After dawn I pushed the sheep out of      camp in the direction I wanted them to head, and stayed      with them a few hours. In mid-afternoon I'd go out to see      how the critters were doing, put any strays back in the      pasture and fix some fence. Woollies are tough to hold!    </p>    <p>      In the evening I'd bring my charges back for the night.      They weren't really hard to gather up . . . in fact, except      for a few ornery old ladies, they'd usually start back on      their own. Also, sheep have a "herd instinct": that is,      when they sense danger they run together in a group. Once I      had them bunched I started the animals home. My ewes were      an older band and knew the way well enough to make it by      themselves while I went after another lot.    </p>    <p>      I developed a cross between a scream and a war whoop which      got the sheep moving, but I still couldn't have done the      job without my dogs (a young border collie and a part blue      heeler). Toward fall I could send one of them maybe a      quarter of a mile after a bunch. The old herders had dogs      which could be sent three and four miles away.    </p>    <p>      Both my helpers were fairly new at herding and sometimes      goofed. Once one got overexcited and pushed about 50 head      into a muddy ravine, where 10 of them got stuck. I had to      take my clothes off, go belly deep into the black, sticky      mess and drag the critters free. When I finished a few      hours later and crawled out completely plastered, I avenged      myself by throwing the dog in the mud.    </p>    <p>      I really enjoyed the beauty of this open land with its      magical rock formations and quiet, majestic sunsets and      sunrises. My horse and I loped all over the countryside . .      . so far that I worried about overworking the mare and gave      her oats and hay around the wagon. She quickly turned into      a big pesty goat, always banging around outside our      quarters and trying to get into our precious hauled water.      At least she was very easy to catch (pretty important out      in the open country). Next spring she should throw us a      colt, so I'll have to use a different horse for a while.    </p>    <p>      One thing I didn't like about sheep country was the      coyotes. They were bad, particularly in the fall when the      spring pups got big enough to hunt on their own. Oftentimes      they don't even clean up their kills. Good herding and      tight fences help a lot, but hungry coyotes can get very      bold . . . and they're hard to shoot from the ground in      this open terrain where they can see you coming for miles.    </p>    <p>      Ranchers can no longer poison coyotes and there are no good      hunting or trapping programs aimed at limiting their      numbers. We agree with the ban on poisoning, but some      control is needed or the brutes will put almost every      sheepman out of business (as is already starting to happen      around here). A look at the piles of bones around our      summer pasture would convince most people of the problem.    </p>    <p>      Even with the coyote menace, though, we still had a good      part of the summer to ourselves. The old-time sheepherder      piled rocks, read cruddy books and drank whiskey to pass      the time. We played music on our autoharp and guitar,      studied home childbirth and did some leatherwork. (I make      our footwear-moccasins-and hope to have      collected a couple of cowhides by next year so I can make      an Indian saddle and other things.)    </p>    <p>      We also walked a lot, starting with the mile to the mailbox      twice a week. And every day we did a mile and a half on      foot or horseback to hand-water the garden. Lynda and I had      planned a good-sized patch but-after a few days of      digging and breaking up the earth by hand-we settled      for a plot 20' X 25'. We mulched the crops, had a fair      harvest and learned a lot about food-growing in this area.      In the fall we used our boss' rototiller to turn the soil      over after adding sheep manure. Next year we'll have a      water pump and-we hope-a better planned and      more plentiful garden.    </p>    <p>      We ate a few of the local prairie chickens, and if I'd been      a better shot we'd have had a wild turkey and the rabbit      which nibbled some of our produce. I saw a few rattlesnakes      and we thought about trying some of the meat, but decided      not to kill them unless they endangered us. We also      considered prickly pear cactus for our table . . . never      got around to tackling it, though. There are cacti all over      and it took us a good couple of weeks to learn to avoid      stepping on them in our moccasins.    </p>    <p>      So the summer went on, and on August 27 Father Sky and      Mother Earth gave us a beautiful 5-1/2-pound slightly      red-haired daughter. We couldn't find a midwife to help,      but had studied home birth for quite a while and went ahead      anyhow. When contractions began we got the wagon ready and      started our first Lamaze breathing exercise. Thirteen hours      later we were still having contractions and felt that      everything wasn't going as it should. We finally decided to      drive to the hospital 75 miles away. Lynda had 34 hours of      labor but because of the Lamaze method she never      experienced much pain. Next child, we'll find some help and      have a home birth.    </p>    <p>      Two words of advice if you're going to have a baby: Take      the Lamaze course, and at least look through <em>Let's Have      Healthy Children</em> by Adelle Davis. Nutrition is      essential for a pregnant and nursing mother and a little      babe.    </p>    <p>      We named our small one Wynden Sage, and she slept with us      the rest of the time we were herding sheep. She was the      delight of all the old farm couples who were our summer      neighbors.    </p>    <p>      Then fall came, with welcome cooler days and lots of      wildlife. I enjoyed that time the most out of the six      months we spent on the range. On October 27 we trailed the      sheep home and cut out the wether lambs for market. Our      small family then moved into a house on the ranch-the      first we've lived in since we've been together-to      work for our boss through the winter.    </p>    <p>      Herding and farmwork are good jobs to have while you're      trying to get your own place. You learn a lot, get plenty      of sunshine and fresh air and can usually raise some stock      of your own. (Our boss encourages us to keep critters, and      will give us bum lambs to raise. He also feeds and shelters      our goats and horse year round.) We don't make a lot of      money, but our expenses are few and we save a good part.      Soon we hope to be paying on 20 to 40 acres of our own.    </p>    <p>      If you've read this article, you already know more about      sheep and herding than I did when I started. If you want to      try our way of life, you can get names of possible      employers through the Montana, Wyoming or Idaho Sheep      Associations. Good luck!    </p>
