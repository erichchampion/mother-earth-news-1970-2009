    <p>
                       <p>      For two years now Caryn and I have lived in a one-room log      cabin in the forested foothills of southwestern Oregon's      Cascade Mountains. It's half a mile down a footpath to our      nearest neighbor, and another mile-and-a-half hike beyond      his place to the point where we must leave our truck.      Living somewhat isolated as we do, we must often cover the      two miles of trail at night after visiting friends or upon      returning late from a supply run to the outside world.      Often, too, we'll stay the evening with Sonny-the      old-timer down the hill-and have to trek home in the      dark.    </p>    <p>      One night our first fall here, just after we'd moved into      our rejuvenated cabin, we were about to leave Sonny's      place. When I got out our flashlight, the old fellow kind      of chuckled and said we'd be better off to use a "bug".      Sonny has lived on his mining claim in these hills for 25      years, so he pretty much knows the best ways to get around      . . . and I thought I'd better heed what he said.    </p>    <p>      "Bug", we learned, is the old-time term for a sort of      simplified lantern: a can (roughly one-pound size) turned      on its side with a handle affixed to the "top" and a candle      shoved up through a hole cut into the "bottom". When the      gadget is lit, the container acts as a reflector and shield      and the grip keeps your hand from getting hot. When the      candle burns low after a while, you just push it farther up      into the tin. I'd seen a couple of these strange      contrivances hanging in the bushes way down the trail, and      a couple more on Sonny's porch, but hadn't gotten around to      asking about them.    </p>    <p>      Well, on the way home that night we compared a bug with our      flash light . . . and now I'll choose the old-fashioned      gadget almost any time. The trouble with the electric torch      is that single bright beam which you must continually point      at where you're stepping. Even though the bulb does also      give off amore general glow, your eyes automatically adjust      to the brilliant spot so that it's hard to expand your      field of vision. The bug, on the other hand, spreads its      light over a large area and makes it extremely easy to      follow a trail.    </p>    <p>      I think the bug also beats a lantern for outdoor night      use-especially for trail walking-because its      light is more easily directed and not clouded by wires,      braces and a perennially dirty chimney. True, a lantern can      be set down while a standard bug of the kind described here      must be hung . . . but I'm working on a prototype that can      do both.    </p>    <p>      You can whip out a bug in a matter of minutes, completely      from recycled materials except for the candle. (If you make      your own candles too, so much the better.)    </p>    <p>      Start with an old-style one-pound coffee can (the flat      kind, not the taller, narrower new variety). I've also used      14-ounce tobacco cans and one-pound lard cans, both of      which are slightly deeper but work just as well. I'm sure      many other tins would be fine too, as long as they have a      diameter of five inches or so . . . that is, enough room      for a candle to burn freely.    </p>    <p>      Place the can on its side and punch a hole through the rim      at the front and a couple more directly across at the back      edge. Fashion a section of coat-hanger, the bail from a      gallon paint can or a similar sturdy wire into a handle      shape and hook both ends to the container through the      holes. just the plain wire works fine but can be      embellished with a grip made from a section of small limb,      dowel, rubber tubing or hose.    </p>    <p>      On the side of the can opposite the handle-centered      about halfway between the rim and the bottom-make two      cuts about one and a half to two inches long, in an "X"      pattern. A sturdy pointed knife does this easily. Then take      a utility candle and gently shove it through the center of      the crosscut, from the outside to the inside, so that it      extends an inch or two into the container. The sharp points      of metal centered at the "X" will bend inward and hold the      shaft of wax securely in place. As the candle shortens with      use, it can easily be pushed farther in. The prongs will      prevent it from slipping back out. (The size of the candle      is up to you, but a thick, long-lasting shape is more      satisfactory than a cheap thin one designed to burn fast.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, pick up the newly made bug, light the candle and      walk out into the dark. You'll be pleasantly surprised at      how well your substitute lantern-flashlight serves you.      Even on the blackest night, one candle power is all you      need! The little light should shine on through rain or snow      and will gallantly withstand an incredible amount of wind.      (We know . . . we've used ours these past couple of years      in all sorts of weather.)    </p>    <p>      The bug is definitely a more for less item. If you're      operating on a shoestring budget, why not make one and try      it out before you spend money on more conventional,      elaborate and expensive light-producing conveniences?    </p>
