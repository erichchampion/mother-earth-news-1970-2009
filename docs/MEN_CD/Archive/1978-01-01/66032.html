    <p>
                       <p>      <em>It was on a chill day in the autumn of 1932 that Helen      and Scott Nearing turned their backs on New York City and      signed an agreement to buy a run-down farm in Vermont's      Green Mountains. And there they lived for the next 20 years      ... clearing brush, building honest stone structures, and      raising most of their own food in gardens that were      unbelievably vigorous and productive for New England.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It was a Good Life. So good that when "developers"      began turning the slopes around them into a ski resort ...      the Nearings pulled up stakes, moved to a rocky inlet on      the coast of Maine, and started all over again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find Helen (74) and Scott (94)      today ... still clearing brush, building honest stone      structures, and raising most of what they eat in gardens      that are unbelievably vigorous and productive for New      England.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Two of MOTHER's people were fortunate enough to spend a      day with the Nearings this past fall and, as some of the      photos accompanying this article attest, they had more than      a little difficulty just keeping up with Helen and Scott as      they followed the two legendary homesteaders around.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In the first place, MOTHER's editor and photographer      couldn't have slept late if they'd wanted to. Why? Because      Scott was up at dawn and spent the next hour (right outside      their bedroom window) splitting wood for the Nearing's two      wood-burning stoves.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Then, after a simple but hearty breakfast, both Helen      and Scott put in a few hours mixing concrete and setting      flagstones into the floor of the combination      storeroom/garage ,that they're currently building. This, of      course, was just a little light limbering-up exercise to      give them an appetite for their lunch (again simple ... but      monstrous!). After the midday meal, of course, the Nearings      slowed down considerably ... for them.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Which is to say that Helen only picked a couple of      bushels of late beans from their garden, went to town for      the mail, rummaged through a small storehouse of the books      they've written and hauled several boxes of the titles back      to their house, took care of other business, ran errands      over what seemed to be half of Maine,      and-finally-delivered MOTHERS representatives      to a distant airport.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And Scott? With a little help from two or three      assistants approximately 70 years his junior, Scott idly      whiled away the afternoon digging a couple of hundred      buckets of grass and weeds from the Nearings' blueberry      patch, oversaw the transplanting of lettuce and other      vegetable sets into their sun-heated greenhouse, explained      the finer points of wholistic gardening to a few people,      and otherwise kept the homestead under control. (That's the      trouble with these vegetarians. They can still do so damn      much at 94 that they make this generation's 20-year-old      fast food munchers look positively sickly and infirm.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>But that's not what the following excerpts from the      Nearings' latest book (they've written more than 50) are      all about. These excerpts are about the sun-heated      greenhouse that Helen and Scott use to supply themselves      with fresh green vegetables right through the heavy snows      and frigid winds of a New England winter.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Nearings really know how to feed themselves well in      a rugged climate without using energy-intensive      gardening systems, as the following snippets from their new      book prove ... and we hope this tiny taste of Helen and      Scott's genius will inspire you to run right out and buy      their new $6.95 paperback-Building and Using Our      Sun-Heated Greenhouse-for your very own. It's worth      far more than its price.</em>    </p>          <p>      We began our winter gardening in an unheated greenhouse      almost by accident. A small seedling (or seed) got lost      under a bench, and in early January, going by chance into      the ice-cold building, we found a flourishing, lush, and      sizable lettuce plant growing through a clump of dry      leaves. It had survived, unwatered and untended, through      several months of outside freezing, in a sheltered but      chill corner of a cold glassed-in building.    </p>    <p>      If this could happen, uncared for and unbeknownst, why      could not more lettuces, and other plants, survive, under      better conditions, still without artificial heat? We were      launched on an experimental period of greenhouse building      and planting that has provided us with fresh green things      through thirty winters of freezing and below-zero weather.    </p>    <p>      Without question, plant germination and growth is checked      by cold weather, and only certain plants can survive. Very      low temperatures will kill almost any growing thing      eventually. But there is a wide margin, and our experiments      pointed up the plants that will not be killed by low      temperatures.    </p>    <p>      Almost all of our gardening experience has been in the      North Temperate Zone, taking advantage of summer sunshine      when we can get it, and taking cover as cold blasts from      the north and east strip the foliage from trees and crumple      down green crops in the garden. One of our chief aims in      gardening is to find those plants that can remain succulent      and edible throughout the coldest weather.    </p>    <h3>TIMID IN THE BEGINNING</h3>    <p>      We were timid in the beginning of our early experiments      with winter gardening. Getting up around daylight and going      into the greenhouse at the point of maximum possible frost      damage, we saw plants of lettuce and Chinese cabbage and      celery, escarole, collards, chard, and radishes limp and      wilted as though their life span were near its end. Going      back a few hours later, after the sun had had an hour or      two to melt the frost on the greenhouse roof and windows,      we found the semi-wilted plants revived, standing up sturdy      and strong.    </p>        <p>      After a few such experiences we realized that we had      seriously underrated the frost-resistant capacity of      semi-hardy plants. If a greenhouse looks like a graveyard      early on a zero morning, close the door, wait until the sun      has burned off the frost covering, and you may be      astonished to observe the comeback.    </p>    <h3>FREEZE EASILY</h3>    <p>      Most cultivated garden plants freeze easily. A garden of      beans, corn, tomatoes, and squash can be wiped out by three      or four 28° night temperatures. Other garden plants      such as Chinese cabbage, some lettuces, and celery often      can stand up against temperatures as low as 20°. For      years we have been able to carry over kale, brussels      sprouts, leeks, parsley, and even spinach in the open      garden if a blanket of snow comes before the deep freeze.    </p>    <p>      The winter of 1976-77 was one of the longest      continued cold spells, with no alleviating thaws, that we      remember. The cold started in November and carried on      through to March. We had to leave our farm early in      December for a lecture trip and did not return till late      January.    </p>    <p>      We found two broken windows in our greenhouse and one of      the garden gates wide open and frozen in solid ice.      Nevertheless, our sun-heated greenhouse, minus two      broken-out windows, and heated only by a few days of pallid      sun, was able to supply us with:    </p>    <p>      1. About 100 elephant leeks, still edible and delicious in      mid-February<br />      2. Several dozen celeriac roots<br />      3. Two dozen roots of viable green parsley<br />      4. A score of Pascal celery plants (the outer leaf stems      were frozen, but the growing centers were lively and      green)<br />      5. A dozen small escarole plants that were lightly covered      with dry autumn leaves<br />      6. Several dozen half-grown lettuce plants: Simpson,      Oakleaf, and Buttercrunch<br />      7. Three red chard plants.    </p>    <p>      This is hardly noteworthy in comparison with the glorious      green that has carried over for us some winters, but it      shows what might be done in a winter greenhouse by      gardeners who stayed at home and took care of their winter      gardening.    </p>        <p>      We do not recommend leaving a greenhouse without care. We      believe that if it is given daily attention the plants      which it shelters will be in better condition than if left      in total neglect. What we are propounding is the apparent      capacity of certain untended plants to survive in      continuous sub-zero weather.    </p>    <p>      The simple, cheap, unheated type of greenhouse that we have      evolved adequately protects certain selected greens all      winter. With moderate heat in the garden in summer and      glass protection through the coldest of the winter months,      we have lengthened the season so that we can feed ourselves      year round on growing green things. It is on the basis of      almost half a century of experience with growing lettuce      and other plants in a cold climate that we base our      argument concerning the possibility of year-round gardening      and especially the possibility in a glass-walled unheated      greenhouse.    </p>   <h3>A GREENHOUSE EXTENDS THE GROWING SEASON</h3>    <p>      There are many weeks in a New England gardening season when      temperatures hover around freezing. A spring fog or an      autumn haze holds the temperature at or near freezing. We      guess that during the 120 days from April 1 to June 10 and      from August 25 to October 15, our garden may have around      five killing frosts and another dozen mornings with white      frosts on garden paths. Any one of the killing frosts will      eliminate or cripple sensitive seedlings. All of the      near-frost nights will retard germination and growth.    </p>    <p>      A can, bottle, box, or basket-or even some newspaper      or a light mulch-over each exposed plant will tend to      reduce the frost damage, but a greenhouse provides exactly      the needed protection for everything inside its four walls.      If we have perhaps 105 frost-free days and another 120 days      during which a bit of glass will ward off frost damage, an      unheated greenhouse in our climate belt will provide      adequate frost protection for at least 32 weeks of the      52-week year.    </p>    <h3>VARIETY OF PLANTS</h3>    <p>      Our year-round greenhouse continually contains a wide      variety of plants; some more hardy, some less. In it at      each season-spring, summer, autumn, winter-there are plants      in various stages of development. Seeds, tiny seedlings, or      mature plants occupy every square foot of the greenhouse.      Some seeds, recently sowed, are not yet germinated. Some      will make the salad for the day's evening meal. Some, like      tomatoes or peppers, remain in the greenhouse for months.      All these plants, in various stages, will be transplanted,      consumed, and replaced in their turn. Before the greenhouse      soil gets its next crop of plants or seeds, it will be      reworked, refertilized, and either reseeded or occupied by      seedlings raised in another section of the greenhouse, and      reset in the recently vacated soil.    </p>    <p>      Each month and season will find some variety of plant life      playing its allocated role in providing the edibles that      make up our daily diet. The sequences are carefully planned      to produce the maximum in food value from each square foot      of greenhouse soil, and all tend to extend the growing      season.    </p>  <h3> THE WINTER GREENHOUSE</h3>    <p>      New England wintertime has usually been ruled out as      ungardenable unless it is undertaken in artificially heated      glass houses. Our greenhouse is unheated save by direct and      indirect rays from the sun. Nevertheless we eat out of our      sunheated greenhouse right through the roughest and      toughest winters. How do we do it? We have learned how to      live with and prevail against winter's hazards.    </p>    <p>      The first hazard, of course, is the cold weather. Where we      live in eastern Maine, along the coast, the normal winter      thermometer goes below zero many times each year. Most of      our plants left in the garden crumple up and rot after a      hard frost. Other plants, after freezing, thaw out time      after time. The first task of the would-be winter      greenhouser is to find out which plants will and which will      not stand hard freezing. We have been studying this matter      for the last forty years and are glad to share our      findings.    </p>    <h3>A SECOND HAZARD</h3>    <p>      The second hazard is snow and ice. Snowfall may be a      problem in its own right; it is certainly an effective      check on gardening. Its aftereffects may be even more      serious. A New England snowstorm, driving in from the      northeast, may include rain which melts part of the snow.      If the storm ends by a wind shift into the north, the      resulting drop in temperature turns slush and snow into a      treacherous ice sheet that covers trees, highways, gardens,      and footpaths. Work in the open is brought to a halt, with      foot passengers and drivers alike picking their way with      care, or calling it a time to hibernate.    </p>    <p>      Equipped with a glass roof, a greenhouse is especially      hampered by snow and ice. A snowstorm cuts off light; it      also adds to the roof load. If the snow is freezing as it      falls, it hardens onto the greenhouse roof and stays there      until it is softened up eventually by higher temperatures.      We aim to keep the greenhouse roof clear of snow. We have a      wooden snow-pusher with a long, light handle. As soon as      snow has had a chance to soften up on the roof we push it      off and let in the light.    </p>    <h3>FROZEN GROUND</h3>    <p>      A third winter hazard is ground frozen so hard that it      cannot be worked in the unheated greenhouse. This situation      is avoided or postponed by sprinkling, before the ground      hardens, a moderate layer of dry autumn leaves over any      greenhouse earth that is not covered by foliage. A little      experience will show how thick the layer of dry leaves      should be. We know that if lettuce and other such plants      have a light mulch of dry autumn leaves thrown on them it      helps them to survive. Even on a sub-zero night the ground      covered by such a mulch may be unfrozen.    </p>    <p>      We have checked this point on a bit of land covered by a      thick growth of soft maple, white birch, and pin cherry. If      the normal leaf cover on such a piece of woodland is      undisturbed there will be two or three inches of dry leaves      that can be kicked aside, revealing an unfrozen forest      floor. Unless the ground is water-soaked, the leaves have      curled up and are able to keep large air spaces between      leaves . . . which prevent the ground from freezing.    </p>    <p>      If any of the soil in the cultivated area of the greenhouse      is exposed, keep it stirred up with a light stick or a      small tool, even when it looks as dry as dust. Really dry      ground cannot freeze; it is the water in the ground that      freezes.    </p>    <p>      Another hazard is the succession of freezings and thawings      that the plants may have to undergo in an unheated      greenhouse. One or two such experiences may not prove      fatal, but too many might finish off delicate plants. The      foliage of most hardy or semi-hardy plants will survive a      great deal of freezing and thawing unless there are juicy      stems or other exposed parts that get iced up. Deal with      this difficulty by not touching frozen, brittle plants that      may break off before they thaw.    </p>    <h3>WINTERTIME LETTUCE</h3>    <p>      We come now to lettuce, which is very important to us      because we use it so frequently in salad making, and go out      of our way to have this tender fresh green for at least one      meal every day.    </p>    <p>      Lettuce is a rather fussy cold weather plant. During a zero      night the entire lettuce plant is frozen stiff. When the      sun thaws out the plants, those with thin leaf stems      continue green and alive and go on living normally. After      several freezings, lettuce with thick leaf stems begins to      rot. The leaf stems in Oak Leaf lettuce, for example, are      relatively thin. The stems of Simpson lettuce also are      thin; the leaf stems of Romaine are juicy. The Butterhead      lettuces generally have moderately thick leaf stems.    </p>    <p>      As our experiments have proceeded we have found that      Simpson, Oak Leaf, Green Boston, Buttercrunch, and other      lettuces with particularly dry leaf spines have survived      during our Maine winters. With one exception (the winter of      1975-76) we have succeeded in carrying some-at      least-of our lettuce plants through every winter.      Almost always they went into winter as half-grown plants or      even as plants still in garden flats.    </p>    <p>      Our lettuce plants still in shallow garden flats were wiped      out the winter of 1976-77, while those in beds survived.      Weathermen counted ten distinct storm cycles from the      middle of November 1976 to the end of February 1977. These      storms followed one another closely, without a single thaw      break. In the severest weather the curly endive and      escarole were retarded but did not die. Their growth was      checked but they were not killed by weeks and months of      sub-zero frost.    </p>    <h3>ESCAROLE, A SURVIVOR</h3>    <p>      We would like to refer especially to a bed of broad-leafed      Batavian escarole which we raised in a seed flat and then      transferred to a garden flat. They were three inches high      when moved into a greenhouse bed and covered with autumn      leaves. All of these plants survived the same winter that      killed the lettuce which was in flats.    </p>    <p>      As we pass this unusually persistent and prolonged winter      season in review, we are pleased we went through it before      we wrote this book. Despite its extreme severity we can      report that we were able to carry a variety of vegetable      greens through one sub-zero period after another with no      thaw in between. Each sub-zero cycle proved to us that our      basic assumption concerning the capacity of succulent green      vegetation to outlast deep freeze is established beyond      question.    </p>    <h3>OUR FRAGILE CELERY</h3>    <p>      At the other end of the equation is the recognition of the      unquestioned fact that all growing things have their      limits. Celery is more fragile than lettuce. Its leaf stems      are thick and juicy. In the winter of 1976-77 we had      a bed of celery plants which we had raised from seed, put      into garden flats, and heeled into the greenhouse in the      autumn of 1976. The celery plants took the transplanting      well and went into the winter lightly mulched. We then      entered into the toughest winter in memory. In the course      of that winter this batch of celery was completely wiped      out, but it survived for more than a month with outside      temperatures down to seven degrees below zero ... and up to      that time showed little frost damage.    </p>    <h3>ALL WILL NOT SURVIVE</h3>    <p>      It is obvious that all vegetables will not survive a winter      in our sunheated greenhouse. We selected hardy plants and      treated them as well as we could, and we learned a great      deal during these experiments. We found out that a      homesteading family using a sun-heated greenhouse as its      medium can supply itself on a twelve-month basis with salad      and other greens taken directly from the garden and      greenhouse. If our contention is upheld by subsequent      tests, New Englanders and other cold climate homesteaders      have a means of greatly improving their winter diets      without dependence on artificial heating or on products      imported from Florida, Texas, California, or Cuba.    </p>    <h3>PARSLEY HAS A GOOD CHANCE</h3>    <p>      Meanwhile we are continuing our experiments with a greater      variety of plants because we would like to have at least a      dozen greens that will survive the Maine winter in a      sun-heated greenhouse. Our guess is that much depends upon      the water content of succulent leaf stems, also on the      moisture content of the soil in which the plants are      growing.    </p>    <p>      We know that a parsley leaf with a juicy stem will freeze,      that the cells will burst, and that with the first warm      weather the stem will begin to rot. But please note the      difference between the stem and the leaf webbing. The leaf      web may go on living for days and weeks despite the loss of      the leaf stem support. This fact leads us to conclude that      certain varieties of parsley, lettuce, and other plants-      carefully selected for the relative dryness of the leaf      stems-will survive, particularly if watering is reduced to      a minimum.    </p>    <h3>A BETTER LIFE</h3>    <p>      Through the ages human beings have been searching for a      good life ... a better life. The current movement to      homestead, to live simply and quietly, in good health, in      clean air, and in the country is part and parcel of that      long-term trend. It is not only a movement for individual      betterment; it implies social change and improvement as      well.    </p>        <p>      From Buildiong and Using Our- Heated Greenhouse by Helen      and Scott Nearing , copyright© 1977 by Garden Way      Publishing, Charlotte, Vt., and reprinted here by      permission. This book is available in hard cover ($9.95)      and paperback ($6.95) from any good bookstore and (in      paperback only) from Mother Mother's Bookshelf.    </p>    <p>      As the determination to live a better life spreads through      the North Temperate Zone, it is being transformed from a      wish or dream stage into concrete social patterns.      Providing fresh green food in a sunheated greenhouse is but      one example of this advance. A large degree of      self-sufficiency lies within the easy reach of any      homesteaders who have established themselves and who are      ready to put time, energy, and ingenuity into stabilizing      their homestead way of life.    </p>    <p>      A sun-heated greenhouse is a project that practically any      family can work at and benefit by. The undertaking can      enlarge the possibilities of income. It can extend and      enlarge the variety and quality of food consumed. It can      enhance the homestead itself by an attractive addition to      the home buildings. And it can open up a better life for      its builders and for the country at large.    </p>
