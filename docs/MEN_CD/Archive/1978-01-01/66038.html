    <p>
                   <p>      <strong>Now</strong> <strong><em>-</em> while      winter's upon us <em>-</em> is the time to plan for      the coming year's warm weather pleasures: camping, fishing,      backpacking, and the like. And whether you're a neophyte in      the wilds or a seasoned outdoorsman, cold weather musings      about such activities bring to mind at least SOME essential      camping gear that you don't have but wish you      owned.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Well, Russ Mohney <em>-</em> author of MAKE      IT AND TAKE IT, a new book on homemade equipment for camp      and trail <em>-</em> wants you to fill in those gaps      on your own . . . and his book contains simple, illustrated      instructions for putting together 40 different      rough-it-in-comfort devices. You need only take one look at      his text to see that the man makes a good case for some      fairly inspired self-sufficiency. (You name the camping      necessity, and Russ has a way for you to create it      yourself.)</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Here, for starters, are five projects from the      book. Why not try one or more, just for what Russ Mohney      calls the "pure, unadulterated fun" of it? It's never too      soon to start gearing up!</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>From Make it and Take It by russ Mohney,      CopyrightÂ© 1977 by PacificSearch, Seattle Washington,      Reprinted by permission, Available in paperback ($4.95)      from any good bookstore or from Mother's Bookstore</em>    </p> <h3>   BACKPACK OVEN</h3>        <p>      There are few outdoor arts that have progressed as rapidly      as the business of eating. In the past few decades, we've      gone from a bacon-and-beans fare cooked in a cast-iron      skillet to such delicacies as turkey tetrazzini fixed in      the backpacker's equivalent of a French oven. After a      rather short evolutionary period, we have been blessed with      every imaginable version of dehydrated, freeze-dried,      enriched, and vacuum-packed food. And most require nothing      more than a warm breeze to complete the cooking and serving      processes.    </p>    <p>      Although the outdoor gourmet's hardware has also improved,      mainly through the development of newer and lighter metals,      we are still accustomed to sadly dismissing such culinary      delights as fluffy cakes, cinnamon rolls, and the Yankee      pot roast as patently out of reach.    </p>    <p>      But these delectables <em>-</em> and an unending list      of others <em>-</em> are suddenly within the realm of      possibility! The device that will satisfy our innermost      mealtime lusts is the simple backpack oven. To add one to      your camping essentials, begin by dropping by the nearest      hardware store or thrift shop and securing a ten-inch angel      food cake tin and a lid that fits it. (Because of the      steep, tapered sides of the pan, you may be forced to adapt      a cover that ALMOST FITS.)    </p>    <p>      Once constructed and then placed over a little backpack      stove, this pan and lid will be transformed into an oven      capable of baking biscuits, roasts, or angel food cakes.      This oven adds an entirely new dimension to camp cookery,      and weighs just a tad compared to the benefit it provides.      Moreover, it can be assembled in short order for about      one-tenth the cost of a comparable commercial model.    </p>    <p>      A. Make the oven body out of a 10-inch angel food cake tin.      Using wire cutters, cut off about one inch from the top of      the inside center column.    </p>    <p>      B. Fit a 10-inch cookware lid to the oven body, being      careful not to wedge the lid in too tight. At about      two-inch intervals, cut a series of V notches. Tabs will be      formed at the same time.    </p>    <p>      C. Bend the tabs inward until the lid conforms to the      angled sides of the cake tin. The form-fitted cover should      fit snugly.    </p>    <p>      D. When using your backpack stove, keep it on low heat,      allowing the dry heat to draft up the center column. This      also helps to keep the bottom of the pan from burning.    </p>    <h3>FILLET BOARD</h3>        <p>      When I first started filleting fish, I found that the      simple procedure shown in the handbooks was anything but      simple. Instead of whisking away a couple of perfect      boneless fillets, I usually reduced the slippery little      creatures to a state variously described as shredded      asbestos, skinny scallops, or wet linen lace. If I did      manage to carve a reasonable little fillet, it was either      at the cost of around eighty percent of the original fish      or several injured fingers, depending on whether I      attempted frugality or safety.    </p>    <p>      One summer, in the midst of my frustration, I happened to      go fishing with an almost retired commercial fisherman      named Ed Brown. His mastery of filleting was exceeded only      by his colorful vocabulary and legendary prowess at sea. In      moments, Ed could transform a flopping, bucket-mouthed      lingcod into a pile of the most beautiful, pure white      fillets ever seen by man. The difference in his technique      and mine (quite beyond the obvious difference between      experience and novice enthusiasm) seemed to be only the      board that firmly held his fish during the operation. In      short order, I learned that a good filleting board was      infinitely superior to holding the wriggling fish between      my knees!    </p>    <p>      The fillet board consists of only a board and a clamp. The      board serves as a platform that keeps the clamp      <em>-</em> and subsequently the fish <em>-</em>      in a stable position for dressing.    </p>    <p>      Since most of us are going to be filleting the occasional      bass and rockfish that we land, the board need not be a      large one. Most of us can get by nicely with about an      inch-thick, 24-inch-long fillet board. (The added weight of      a fairly thick board helps keep your slippery quarry in the      same county as you during the filleting operation.) DO NOT      PAINT OR VARNISH THE BOARD. It is better to occasionally      replace the wooden part of your device than risk      potentially dangerous paint chips in your dinner!    </p>    <p>      The clamp is a spring set of laws that holds the beast in      place while the dark deed is done. The standard office      clipboard (with a good, strong spring) is ideal for      fashioning into a nifty clamp.    </p>    <p>      This is another of those really simple devices that makes      the whole outdoor business a lot more fun.    </p>    <p>      A. Remove the clip from a standard office supply clipboard.    </p>    <p>      B. With a hacksaw, remove the wide wings on either side.    </p>    <p>      C. Then saw notches into the face of the clip to create      three or four teeth.    </p>    <p>      D. Bend the teeth into a slight downward curve in order to      better secure the fish on the finishing board.    </p>    <p>      E. Mount the newly formed clamp onto a solid board about 12      X 24 inches.    </p>    <p>      F. To use, just clip the fish onto the board, and use BOTH      hands to cut away the boneless fillets!    </p>    <h3>FANNY PACK</h3>        <p>      The more genteel among us will undoubtedly refer to this      simple little day pack as a belt pack, but this is the same      gang that refers to underwear as "unmentionables"! As I do      not belong to that group, it will be called here, as it      ought to be, "the fanny pack".    </p>    <p>      The design of this particular fanny pack is about as      straightforward and logical as it can be. Although there      are many exotic designs on the market, a box belt pack is      the easiest to make and the most efficient for day hiking.      The pack body consists of a nylon box that is large enough      to carry a lunch, camera, first-aid kit, or any of the      other paraphernalia you ordinarily take on a short hike      from a base camp. Because the fanny pack is not expected to      carry a particularly heavy load, a light nylon web is      strong enough to be used for the belt (an adjustable buckle      is attached to it). Just below the top cover, the pack      closes with a nylon zipper, which will not corrode.    </p>    <p>      This pack is my favorite way of carrying gear on the short      day hike. It is less tiring than even a small backpack, is      easier to get things out of, and is out of the way during a      rest stop.    </p>    <p>      A. Make the entire body of the pack from one-half yard of      coated, waterproof nylon cut to the dimensions shown in      Fig. D.    </p>    <p>      B. Before sewing anything, cut the inch zipper hole by      merely slitting the material two inches below the edge of      the top cover and cutting two one-inch T's on each end.      Fold the flaps under in order to install the zipper, as      shown. Make sure the zipper is installed so the seams and      edging will end up inside the finished bag.    </p>    <p>      C. Fold the material to form the box shape. (For      simplicity, this illustration shows the box right side      out.)    </p>    <p>      D. Now sew the basic box in the following order. Use plain      seams on all edges.    </p>    <p>      1. Sew the bottom edges to the short side edges (a).<br />      <br />      2. Sew the front edges to the long side edges (b).<br />      <br />      3. Sew the top edges to the short side edges (c).<br />      <br />      4. OPEN THE ZIPPER.<br />      <br />      5. Sew the top edge to the front edge (d).<br />      <br />      6. Push the complete bag through the open zipper. Be persis      tent until you have the bag right side out and the zipper      works.<br />      <br />      E. Sew the pack to a lightweight nylon web belt (its length      is determined by your circumference) that has an adjustable      buckle. Spread the zipper as wide as possible and sew the      back of the bag to the belt.    </p>    <h3>BOOT HANGER</h3>        <p>      This is one of those simple little devices that really does      a good job, takes only a dime's worth of wire, and can be      made in a matter of minutes.    </p>    <p>      The hanger is bent from wire in such a manner that it      adapts to almost any boot and also folds flat for carrying.      The boots hang sale upward, allowing the moisture inside to      evaporate quickly and naturally. When drying hiking boots      this way, be sure to keep them away from direct heat, even      that of the campfire. Nothing will age or damage the      material faster than overdrying after a thorough soaking,      so use a little patience when drying your shoes and boots.      They'll last a lot longer and serve you better while      they're around.    </p>    <p>      A. Make the hanger by bending three feet of wire. Be sure      that dimension X on each side is narrow enough to grip each      boot firmly, and that dimension Y is equal on each side for      proper balance.    </p>    <p>      B. For a hanger, fashion a wire hook out of a short piece      of wire.    </p>    <p>      C. Make the clamping loops of the hanger narrow enough to      fit below the heal reinforcements of your boots so that the      soles are held upright.    </p>    <h3>CRAWFISH TRAP</h3>        <p>      The best crawdaddy bait is NOT <em>-</em> contrary to      popular misconceptions <em>-</em> a chunk of      well-seasoned fish. I have found crawfish to be pretty      fussy eaters, and they greatly prefer a fresh fish to      almost anything else. In an effort to be consistent and      characteristically cheap, I usually bait my traps with a      small tin of fish-flavored cat food. I punch a few holes in      either and to lot the wildly appealing odor (to a crawfish,      at least) wash into the water to attract my quarry.    </p>    <p>      Once you're ready to fish, weight the trap down with a      couple of hefty rocks or anything else that will make it      sink. It's imperative, of course, that you tie a rope to      the whole affair before you toss it overboard, unless you      cherish the thought of swimming after it!    </p>    <p>      The weighted, baited trap can then be tossed into water      practically anywhere, just as long as the water is      relatively pollution-free. Crewfish live in almost every      body of fresh or brackish water in North America, so keep      looking until you find a hot spot. The trap is usually left      overnight in order to catch the bigger crawfish, which are      mainly nocturnal feeders.    </p>    <p>      When you bring in your catch, thoroughly rinse them, and      then pop them into salted, boiling water for about five to      seven minutes, after which they will be bright red and      quite dead. Break off the tells, and peel and devein them.      Eat the 'dads as is or add them to almost any kind of      seafood dish you like. Many people also eat the      comparatively small but delicious bits of meat in the      claws, a morsel that is usually referred to as "nectar" by      crawfish devotees. It is a rare and delicate feast. When      this trap is so easy to build and use, it's incredible that      the rewards from using it can include some of the finest      eating to be found anywhere.    </p>    <p>      This cylindrical trap is constructed of hardware cloth, a      rather folksy name for one-half-inch mash galvanized wire.      The hardware cloth can be purchased at almost any store      bearing the same name and is relatively inexpensive. It's      different from most other wires because <em>-</em>      when you cut a piece of it with tin snips <em>-</em>      little pieces of stiff wire protrude every half-inch along      the fresh cut. These little wires are the means by which      two pieces of hardware cloth are joined. Push the little      wires through the solid wire on the edge of the other chunk      of cloth (see illustration) and then bend them around the      uncut wire like hinges.    </p>    <p>      A. To make the body of the trap, take a 20 X 24-inch piece      of hardware cloth and roll it into a cylinder. The diameter      of the cylinder is eight inches.    </p>    <p>      B. Connect the ends of the hardware cloth where they meet      on the cylinder by pushing the cut wires of one end through      a complete course of wire squares on the other and. Fold      the cut wires back onto the first end, as shown.    </p>    <p>      C. To make the tunnels, cut the cloth into a large circle      (at least 12 inches in diameter for an eight-inch      cylinder). Next cut a smaller inner circle about four      inches in diameter.    </p>    <p>      D. Join the two sides of the tapered cut and you have a      tunnel. Overlap the two edges to adjust for the proper      size. Wire the tunnel closed and trim off all protruding      wires. Wire the tunnel to the cylinder.    </p>    <p>      E. Cut a six-inch-square access door along the side of the      tunnel. Connect the upper edge of the door to form a hinge      using the same method as described in instruction B. You      can fasten it with any wire hook or rubber arrangement.    </p>
