                     <h5 id="byline">by GENE LOGSDON</h5>        <p>      I remember the first year we grew grains in our garden. A      good gardening buddy dropped by one day early in July just      when our wheat was ripe and ready to harvest. He didn't      know that though. His reason for stopping was to show me      two splendid, juicy tomatoes picked ripe from his garden.      After a few ritual brags <em>-</em> and knowing full      well that my tomatoes were still green-he asked me in a      condescending sort of way what was new in <em>my</em>      garden. I remembered the patch of ripe wheat. "Oh, nothing      much," I answered nonchalantly, "except the pancake patch."    </p>    <p>      "The <em>pancake patch?"</em> he asked incredulously.    </p>    <p>      "Yeah. Sure. Until you've tasted pancakes fresh from the      garden, you haven't lived."    </p>    <p>      "And where might I find these pancakes growing?" he queried      sarcastically, to humor my madness.    </p>    <p>      "Right up there behind the chicken coop in that little      patch of wheat. All you have to do is thresh out a cupful      or two, grind the grain in the blender, mix up some batter,      and throw the whole thing into the skillet. Not even Aunt      Jemima in all her glory can make pancakes like those."    </p>    <p>      My friend didn't believe me until I showed him, step by      step. We cut off a couple of armloads of wheat stalks,      flailed the grain from the heads onto a piece of clean      cloth (with a small plastic baseball bat!), winnowed the      chaff from the grain, ground the grain to flour in the      blender, made batter, and fried pancakes. Topped them with      real maple syrup, Sweet ecstasy. My friend forgot all about      his tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      The next year, he invited me over for grain sorghum      cookies, proudly informing me that grain sorghum flour made      pastries equal to if not better than whole wheat flour.      Moreover, grain sorghum was easier to thresh. I had not      only made another convert to growing grains in the garden,      but had made one who quickly taught me something.    </p>    <h3>GROW YOUR OWN GRAINS</h3>    <p>      The reason Americans find it a bit weird to grow small      plots or rows of grain in gardens is that they are not used      to thinking of grains as food directly derived from the      plant, the way they view fruits and vegetables. The North      American, unlike most of the world (especially Asians and      Africans), thinks grain is something manufactured in a      factory somewhere. Flour is to be purchased, like      automobiles and pianos. Probably the attitude came from the      practice of hauling grains to the gristmill. Without the      convenience of today's small power grinders and blenders,      overworked housewives of earlier times were only too glad      to have hubby haul the grain to the gristmill. And that      gave him an excuse to sit around all day at the mill      talking to his neighbors.    </p>    <p>      But even with the advent of convenient kitchen aids to make      grain cookery easier, the American resists. He will work      hard at the complex task of making wine <em>-</em>      seldom with success <em>-</em> but will not grind      whole wheat or corn into nutritious meal, a comparatively      easy task. I know, because I was that way myself. Until I      saw with my own eyes how practical a good 10-speed blender      was for flour-making, I hesitated. Now it boggles my mind      to remember that for most of my life I lived right next to      acres and acres of amber waves of grain, where combines      made the threshing simplicity itself, and yet our family      always bought all our meal and flour.    </p>    <p>      The real tragedy of that ignorance was that the flour we      purchased usually was the kind that had been degerminated      and debranned too. Most of the nutrition had been taken out      of that flour to give the American housewife what she      seemed to want: a pure white powder that would last      indefinitely on the shelf and make pastries of fluffy,      empty calories.    </p>    <p>      The nutrition picture for whole grains is getting better      all the time, thanks to the progress being made by plant      geneticists. One of the more dramatic developments has been      <em>Opaque-2</em> or high lysine corn, corn with almost      twice the normal amount of the proteins, lysine, and      tryptophan in it. The other is triticale, a cross between      wheat and rye which outyields wheat, oats, rye, and barley,      and has more protein than ordinary corn. New varieties of      oats, long known as the grain with the highest protein      (excluding legume seeds like soybeans), range as high as 17      percent protein content. But studies of new buckwheat      varieties have prompted the Agricultural Research Service      to announce that this traditional crop, now making a      comeback, has an amino acid composition nutritionally      superior to all cereals, including oats.    </p>    <p>      Almost all the grains can be sprouted to make delicious      salads in some ways more nutritious than the dried grain.      Beans, clover (especially alfalfa), and wheat make the best      sprouts for humans, But oats and barley <em>-</em> in      addition to wheat <em>-</em> can be sprouted and fed      to chickens and livestock as top farmers used to do. With      that kind of feed supplement, they could grow healthy      animals even in winter without today's expensive      all-vitamins-included commercial feed.    </p>    <p>      Corn sprouts win no prize for taste, but corn makes up for      that lack with other advantages. Sweet corn and popcorn are      two of our most popular foods, but corn can also be      parched, pickled (corn salad), or made into hominy.    </p>    <p>      Pioneers in the Corn Belt survived some winters almost      totally on corn. They cracked, ground, grated, boiled,      parched, squeezed, flaked, and baked it into porridges,      cakes, muffins, dodgers, and "pone".    </p>    <p>      I don't like whiskey much, but the best I ever tasted was      moonshine "made right" from fermented corn mash. That      bourbon easily surpassed in mellowness the most expensive      firewater you can buy. Of course, other grains make other      kinds of whiskey, and malt from malting barley, a leading      crop in the northernmost states, is used for beer and other      malt foods and drinks.    </p>    <h3>WHOLE GRAINS FOR YOUR LIVESTOCK</h3>    <p>      But the use of whole grains directly in your own diet is      only half the reason for growing them. The other half, just      as important I think, is to assure yourself and your family      an economical, steady supply of milk, meat, and eggs, and      possibly cheese, wool, or other animal products you need or      desire as part of your goal of homegrown security. If you      have to go to the store to buy the grains you need for your      livestock, your own home. raised milk, meat, and eggs will      cost you nearly as much as if you bought them from a farmer      or the store. Furthermore, if you have to buy your grains      in the marketplace, you may have to settle for less      nutritional quality than what you could grow on rich      organic soil and dry by natural methods. Protein and trace      element content vary significantly with the variety of      grain and where and how it is grown. <em>Your eggs, milk,      and meat can't be any better than the grains that produce      them.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BY-PRODUCTS<br /></strong><br />      There's another advantage to growing grains, a dimension      you don't usually find in fruits and vegetables. Grain      plants often give you other important products besides the      grain. Wheat and oats and barley give you straw ... th e      dried stalks left after the grain is threshed. Straw makes      excellent bedding for animals and mulch for the garden. It      can be woven into baskets, too.. Corn leaves dried or      silaged are good roughage feed for cows. Cornhusks can be      plaited into strong rope, fashioned into dolls and      decorations, or used to fill a mattress in a pinch. Cane      sorghum makes good syrup ... buckwheat and clovers provide      the bees with abundant honey. And <em>-</em> not to      be outdone <em>-</em> oats provide the hulls that the      Rolls-Royce people used to use to polish the cylinder      sleeves of their expensive cars. Maybe they still do.    </p>   <h3>CULTURAL PROS AND CONS</h3>    <p>      Finally, the special advantage of grains for the organic      gardener and farmer is that you can grow them more easily      with organic methods than you can fruits and vegetables.      All grains except corn will withstand low fertilization      better than vegetables. Field beans, es. pecially soybeans,      will add nitrogen to the soil. Corn is easier to cultivate      mechanically than fruits and vegetables, and fungal disease      is less of a threat in    </p>    <p>      grains than in fruit. Grains have their share of insect      enemies, but control is not nearly so critical as it can be      in fruits and vegetables. The one disadvantage of growing      grains may be their space requirements. A very small garden      is no place for grains. But some grains can be grown in      large or even in moderate-sized gardens. Soybeans and      buckwheat can be planted as late as July 10 except in the      far north, so they can be doublecropped behind peas, early      beans, lettuce, or strawberries. A late sweet corn patch      may work out well as a second crop too. Barley and wheat      can be planted in the fall after other crops are finished,      and harvested the next summer in time to double-crop that      soil to late vegetables.    </p>    <h3>HOW MUCH GRAIN?</h3>    <p>      Even a peck of grain will make a lot of meals, believe me.      Excess ears of sweet corn needn't go to waste. Dry the      corn, shell it, and make cornmeal in the blender. Or parch      the corn over the fireplace on a winter evening.    </p>    <p>      Once you become familiar with whole grain cookery, you may      want to pursue it. Even if you don't grow your own grains,      you'll not find a better way to make your food dollar pay.      And you'll soon find how much grain you need or want to use      for a year. It won't be as much as you think, unless you      bake all your own bread and pastries.    </p>    <p>      We don't bake a lot of bread, but my wife makes a variety      of cookies, cakes, pancakes, shortcakes, pie crusts, and      cooked dishes with our whole grains. If the grain is ground      fine enough, it makes good bread without the addition of      any white flour.    </p>    <p>      From experience I can say that the following amounts of      grain will be all a typical family will want to use yearly      for cooking and sprouting:    </p>    <p>      Wheat, four pecks (one bushel); corn, two pecks; popcorn,      two pecks; soy beans, four pecks; grain sorghum, two pecks;      buckwheat, one peck; oats, one peck; triticale or rye or      barley, one peck; navy or other soup beans, two pecks;      alfalfa for sprouting, one or two quarts; lentils, field      peas, cane sorghum (for flour), be your own judge. We don't      grow and eat that much yet, but could if we wished, without      increasing our production labor noticeably.    </p>    <p>      You can gauge your own family's consumption by estimating      how much flour, cornmeal, and other grain products you use      now. A cup of wheat will make a little more than a cup of      whole wheat flour, and that holds roughly true for all      grains.    </p>    <h3>FIGURING SPACE REQUIREMENTS</h3>    <p>      In other words, you don't need much space to raise at least      some grains. A normal yield of wheat grown organically      would be about 40 bushels to the acre. So you'd need only      1/40 acre to produce a bushel. That would be a plot of      ground 10 feet wide by about 109 feet long. A really good      wheat grower with a little luck could get a bushel from a      plot half that size. Wheat yields have been recorded as      high as 80 bushels per acre and even higher.    </p>    <p>      But using the same kind of average calculations as above,      here's the amount of space you'd need to grow a bushel of      the following grains:    </p>		    <p>      Don't hold me too tightly to these figures. They're      estimates to give you an idea of how big the playing field      is. Weather, fertility, variety, and know how could alter      the figures. All I'm trying to show, really, is that nine      bushels of assorted grains might be raised on 1/6 acre and      provide you with the major portion of your diet.    </p>    <p>      The amount of grain necessary to support a few livestock is      not large either. You need about 12 bushels of corn to      fatten a feeder pig to butchering weight. A ewe and her      lamb need approximately a bushel of grain a year, if      pasture and hay are abundant. A hen needs about a bushel a      year, a milk cow <em>-</em> along with hay and      pasture <em>-</em> perhaps five or six bushels, and a      beef steer, a little more than that. In other words, an      acre could easily fill the grain requirements for one pig,      one milk cow, one beef steer, and 30 chickens. A top grower      might provide the grain for more than twice that number of      animals on an acre.    </p>    <p>      What <em>is</em> necessary to raise grains successfully in      the large garden or on the small farm is an understanding      of planting harvesting, and processing methods that are no      longer common in commercial farming. In many instances, the      right way in commercial grain farming won't be the right      way for small homestead growers. In some instances, the      right way for you requires a use of the latest      technologies. In other cases it requires a reaching back      for knowledge now almost lost. It takes both the old and      the new to make grain growing and grain eating the cottage      industry it once was. It will also take the best of both      old and new technologies to make the smallscale cultivation      of grain the key to food security it must become if      personal independence is to be maintained and personal      freedom preserved.    </p>    <p>      <em>From Small Scale Grain Raising by Gene Logsdon,      copyright© , 1917 by Rodale Press Inc., Emmaus, Pa..      and reprinted by permission Available hard ($8.95) and      paperback ($4.95) any good bookstore or from Mother's      Bookshelf.</em>    </p>		     <p>      NOTES:    </p>    <p>      1. <em>All the</em> <em>above grains except soybeans may be      cooked by the thermos method. Bring required amounts of      grain and water to a boil, pour into a wide-mouthed      thermos, close, and leave for 8</em> - 12 hours.    </p>    <p>      Another method for cooking grains is the "pilaf" method.      This involves sauteing the grain <em>-</em> usually      with minced onion <em>-</em> in oil and then adding      stock or water (approximately twice as much liquid as      grain) and cooking it, covered, over medium-low heat until      the liquid is absorbed and the grain is tender. The time is      about the same as above. Brown rice, barley, millet, and      wild rice are especially good cooked this way. Buckwheat is      traditionally cooked in this way, but a raw egg is stirred      into the dry grains before adding the stock or water. This      replaces the need for sauteing the buckwheat in oil, and is      done to keep the grains separate throughout the cooking.      The required amount of water is two cups for the "egg"      method of cooking buckwheat, and five cups when cooking it      to be eaten as a cereal.    </p>    <p>      The hard grains such as wheat, rye, and triticale, may be      brought to a boil in the required amount of water, boiled      for 10 minutes, then left to soak for 8 <em>-</em> 12      hours in this same water. After the long soaking, they may      be cooked for 15 <em>-</em> 20 minutes and will be      tender enough to eat. This is one way to shorten the      cooking time.    </p>    <p>      The pressure-cooker method offers the advantages of cutting      the cooking time in the above chart in half. In general,      use twice as much water as grain when cooking in the      pressure cooker, although more waterfour times the amount      of grain <em>-</em> is needed for the harder grains,      such as rye, triticale, and wheat.    </p>    <p>      <em>2.</em> <em>When adding cornmeal to boiling water, it      is best to first combine it with one cup of cold water and      then stir this into the remaining three or four cups of      boiling water. The lesser amount of water is to be used      when you wish to have a stiff cooked cornmeal, as for      cornmeal mush.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>3. The lesser amount</em> of water is required for      short <em>-</em> or medium-grain rice, the larger      amount for <em>long-grain rice</em> .    </p>    <p>      A further tip on cooking grains:    </p>    <p>      To enhance the flavor and shorten cooking time, toast      grains in a dry, medium-hot iron skillet, stirring      constantly, until they have a pleasant fragrance and take      on a darker color. This also enables the grain to be      "cracked" or coarsely ground in an electric blender.    </p>
