                <p>      <strong>Mothers Nature</strong>    </p>            <p>      You’ll find me, on any given day when I can get away,      stalking the deep woods, stumbling down soggy banks into      dark streambeds, peering into hollow moss-covered logs,      craning my neck toward the highest branches of dying trees,      dropping to my knees to sift through leaf litter, rising      and walking in one direction, then another, crisscrossing,      circling, crisscrossing again, with no apparent aim. Seeing      me, only a fellow mycophile would know that I am neither      drunk nor addled nor lost, but simply following my      obsession. I am hunting for mushrooms.    </p>    <p>      My fascination for fungi started because wherever I walked      in the woods, there they were - big ones, little      ones, flat ones, conical ones; red, white, brown, orange;      speckled, smooth, ragged, ruffled - poking up out of      leaf litter, jutting from tree trunks, standing singly on      the ground like lone sentinels, huddled in little groups      like close-lipped conspirators.    </p>    <p>      The trouble was, I had no idea beyond the word mushroom      just what they were. What was that lovely ivory one with      the lacy collar? How about those purplish pixie parasols?      Those wrinkled rust-hued vases?    </p>    <p>      In the face of such frequent reminders, I could ignore my      ignorance for only so long. On every hike, I could almost      hear them taunting me: <em>You don’t know anything      about us. Not even our names.</em>    </p>    <p>      Well, OK, we’ll just see about that.    </p>    <p>      Armed with field guides, I set about learning how to put      mushrooms in their places, taxonomically speaking. Soon I      could distinguish broad families - the fringed-tooth      mushrooms, the spongy-bottomed boletes, the self-describing      coral fungi, the puffballs blowing spore smoke. I also      began mentally sorting the baffling variety of gilled      mushrooms into manageable categories: the bulb-footed      amanitas, the dunce-hatted inky caps, the colorfully capped      russulas, the shell-shaped oysters.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, of course, I was mentally evaluating every      fungus I found for its potential place in either of two      especially noteworthy groups: the edibles and the killers.      Never mind whether you’re a foraging gourmand or just      looking, part of every wild mushroom’s mystique is      the question: Which group is it? The answer in most cases      is neither; not particularly edible, not particularly      poisonous, but somewhere in between. The majority of      mushrooms are harmless, but also bland or distasteful or      otherwise unappetizing. Some others will make you sick or      send you into hallucinations. About a dozen can kill you.      Dozens more are safe and delicious.    </p>    <p>      A decade-plus has passed since I first started putting      names to mushrooms and, frankly, I’m still not all      that good at distinguishing between many look-alikes, or at      placing species names on most mushrooms I find. There are,      after all, more than 10,000 different kinds in North      America.    </p>    <p>      But here’s what I have learned: There’s magic      in mushrooms, not of the sort that makes things disappear,      but instead the kind that opens your eyes to worlds you      once missed. Looking for mushrooms draws you into life      beyond eye level; it compels you to look, and look closely.      It pulls you off trail - what are those red-capped      things over there; is that a glint of white on that tree      trunk? - and into wilder territory. It slows your      pace from hiking speed to one more in tune with the forest      entire. It adds another dimension to your awareness and      enjoyment of the outdoors - another ingredient to be      savored along with the birds and wildlife, the flowering      plants and towering trees, the being there.    </p>    <p>      Oh, and by the way, it also sometimes yields food that is      fit for the gods.    </p>    <p>      I recommend the mushroom hunting hobby, in other words, and      hope you’ll give it a try. Here are some suggestions:    </p>        <p>      <strong>Get a Good Field Guide.</strong> I especially      favor, as a first guide, The National Audubon Society Field      Guide to North American Mushrooms by Gary A. Lincoff.      Nearly half the book is photographs, hundreds of them,      arranged by overall mushroom shape. In one fell swoop, you      get both the big picture - the surprising diversity      of fungi - and an easy way to narrow the      possibilities when trying to match a real-world      ’shroom to one in the book. <em>(Be aware, however,      that many mushrooms cannot be told by appearance alone;      certain IDs must rely on microscopic views of spores. That      big, fresh, colorful mushroom in a field-guide photo may      bear only slight resemblance to the kin you find, or may      look very much like a number of entirely different      species.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Later, you may want a more technical guide keyed to the      many, often fine distinctions that separate species. My      pick in that category is Orson K. Miller’s Mushrooms      of North America. I particularly like it because, in      addition to good photos and identification keys, it      includes an illustrated glossary to the terminology used in      those keys. Keep your eye out, too, for regional guides      that focus solely on the species that occur in your area,      thus narrowing the guide’s field.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Look Where the Sun Doesn’t Shine.</strong>      One nice thing about hunting for mushrooms is that      you’re almost certain to bag something -      wherever you are, they are too. Hardly a breeze blows      that’s not laden with spores. Mushrooms have even      been known to push through city sidewalks. Suburban lawns,      Alaskan tundra and desert chaparral all harbor fungi.    </p>    <p>      Some common species favor open, sunny habitat. But for the      greatest variety (and quantity), head for the shaded woods.      Unlike plants, mushrooms and all other fungi - molds,      yeasts and mildews - don’t produce their food      from sunlight. Instead, they feed off the nutrients in      other organisms. Fungi release enzymes that break down      material, then they consume the nutrition. Most mushrooms      live on dead organic matter - and that’s a good      thing, too, or we’d be up to our ears in detritus.      Others draw their sustenance from living plants.    </p>    <p>      In any case, because they generally don’t need sun      and do need moisture, mushrooms are in greatest abundance      in the nooks and crannies of the forest, where the sun      doesn’t shine full bore. Leaf litter is a favorite      refuge for black trumpets; pear-shaped puffballs emerge on      rotting logs; oyster mushrooms climb tree trunks. To find      them, look around, in and under, up and down.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Remember the Iceberg Principle.</strong> Because of      their beauty and diversity, it’s tempting to view      mushrooms much like wildflowers, which are plants growing      mostly above ground. But a mushroom is only the fruit, or      more precisely the fruiting body, of a fungus growing      underground or within wood. Dig beneath a specimen and      you’ll find the main part, a mass of white threads      called a mycelium. The white threads themselves are called      hyphae. Each hypha grows from the tip much like a      plant’s roots, releasing enzymes and absorbing      moisture and nutrients.    </p>    <p>      This is significant stuff to mushroom hunters for two      reasons. First, it’s reassuring to know that      harvesting mushrooms is more akin to plucking berries from      an underground vine than yanking wildflowers by their      roots. Although it’s always wise to pick only a few      mushrooms from any given spot - particularly if      you’re in an area where others also forage -      you can rest assured the “plant” itself will      live to produce more fruit.    </p>    <p>      Also, you can use your awareness of hyphae habits to help      you locate or identify mushrooms. Many species grow only in      mutually beneficial relationships with certain kinds of      trees. Their hyphae attach themselves to and spread from      the tree’s roots, drawing distant soil nutrients into      the tree while gaining necessary food from it. Slippery      jacks, for example, live only under pines or spruce. To      look for the mushroom, look for its host trees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Details, Details.</strong> The real business of      mushrooming is telling one from the other. Some are so      distinctive they can’t be mistaken. Most are not.      Because there are so many look-alikes, the devil is in the      details: What color, shape and texture are the      mushroom’s cap, gills and stem? Is the specimen      growing singly or in groups, in soil or in rotting or      living wood? Are the gills thick or thin, opaque or      translucent? Is the stem tapered or straight, hollow or      solid? Is there a bulbous sac at the base or a lacy veil at      the top?    </p>    <p>      To find all the answers, you must study your mushrooms      closely. Start in the field by taking notes, addressing as      many of the above questions as possible and more: What      trees are nearby? Does the specimen have a distinctive      odor? What’s the season, temperature? Jot everything      down on a small notepad. Then, using a trowel or a sturdy      knife, ease the mushroom from its place, taking care to get      the entire stalk out of the ground. A mushroom’s base      can be a vital clue. Wrap the specimen in waxed paper or      put it in a paper bag (not plastic, or your mushroom will      become only mush).    </p>        <p>      When you get home, examine each specimen even more closely      with a 10x hand lens. Compare your notes and observations      with field-guide descriptions. True, you’ll soon be      awash in terms like “squamules” and      “glabrous.” Don’t let them intimidate you      - persist, and use your guide’s glossary.    </p>    <p>      A mushroom’s spore color is an essential clue, too,      revealed by taking a spore print. Cut off the stem, put the      cap gill- or pore-side down on a piece of white paper, and      cover it with a bowl or jar larger than the mushroom. The      next day, lift the cap to reveal the print - often      lovely, and always worth saving with your notes for future      reference.    </p>    <p>      Identifying mushrooms can be frustrating, especially to a      beginner. Just keep at it. Soon enough you’ll get a      few positive IDs under your belt, and names to go with      them: “Ah, that’s a velvet foot, Flammulina      velutipes,” you’ll say. “Hmmm, a mica      inky cap, Coprinus micaceus.” Other times, your      specimen won’t seem to match anything in your guide.      No problem. Keep your notes, and give the darn thing your      own name for now. Among my favorite local mushrooms is a      small and delicate species I found and named some 10 years      ago: “Those-little-pink-jobbies.”    </p>        <p>      <strong>“Edible” Doesn’t Mean      “Eat.”</strong> The bad news is, roughly a      dozen mushroom species are not just make-you-sick toxic but      are killers - and relatively common. The good news      is, you can easily avoid them. If you’re unsure of      any mushroom’s identity, just don’t eat it. For      a beginner, that means avoiding all wild mushrooms. Even      with experience, think twice before sampling any mushroom      with gills - particularly white gills. Among those      are the widespread and attractive but treacherous Amanitas,      including the aptly named death cap. Avoid LBMs, too, or      “little brown mushrooms.” Among those are the      deadly galerina.    </p>    <p>      Now more good news: While you’re honing your skills      for distinguishing confusing gilled mushrooms, you can add      easier-to-identify nongilled types to your edibles list,      one at a time. Virtually all morels, corals, boletes and      puffballs are safe; some are delicious, and even a novice      can learn to recognize and enjoy them, given reasonable      care. Do note the terms “virtually” and      “reasonable care,” however. Even among these      groups, potentially serious pitfalls exist. The best way to      learn edibles is to search with someone who knows them      well, or join an organized mushrooming group on field      trips.    </p>    <p>      And finally, don’t be surprised if one day you      realize, while crawling on your knees sifting through leaf      litter or peeking into hollow logs, that you don’t      particularly care whether a specimen is edible. It’s      the fungi themselves - their beauty, variety, mystery      - and the places they take you in finding them that      draw you to the woods.    </p>    <p>      <em>Congratulations. You’ve just discovered the real      magic in mushrooms.</em>    </p>
