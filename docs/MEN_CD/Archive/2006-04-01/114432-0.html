        The reactor from the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Portland, Ore., is positioned for burial at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash. The Trojan plant began operation in 1976 but was plagued by structural problems and opposition from environmentalists before it was closed in 1992. The power plant became a symbol of greed, evil and environmental negligence on the cartoon The Simpsons.
