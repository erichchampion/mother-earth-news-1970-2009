                    <h5 id="byline">      By George DeVault    </h5>    <h3>      Create your own spot for summer fun, as well as a water      source for irrigation, livestock and fighting fires.    </h3>        <p>      <strong>O</strong>ne of the first things many people say      when looking out over a few acres is, “I wish I had a      pond.” Ponds add scenic beauty to a property and      provide opportunities for boating, swimming and fishing.      There also are many practical uses for a      pond?-?livestock watering, crop irrigation, fish      production, wildlife habitat and as an emergency source of      water for fighting fires.    </p>    <p>      In 1956, when my parents bought 15 acres in the country,      the first thing they did was build a pond. Actually, Mom      and Dad didn’t build it themselves; they hired a man      with a bulldozer. The huge, yellow machine quickly scooped      out a natural depression along an old fence row. Soil was      piled thick and high at the lower end of the slope to form      a modest earthen dam. When the rains came, the hole began      filling with water. That was three years after legendary      homesteaders Helen and Scott Nearing started enlarging a      spring to build a pond at their new homestead in coastal      Maine. True to form, the Nearings did most of the work      themselves - by hand. For more than 25 years the      Nearings continued to expand their pond, steadily deepening      and enlarging it.    </p>    <p>      Ponds, like their owners, come in an endless variety of      shapes and sizes. But each one is “a spot of beauty,      a sparkling universe teeming with life,” Louis      Bromfield wrote in his 1948 book, Malabar Farm. “For      the children they are a source of inexhaustible delight.      And like the fishponds of the abbeys and castles of      medieval Europe and the Dark Ages, when all the world fell      apart in anarchy and disorder, they provide not only food      for the table but peace for the soul and an understanding      of man’s relationship to the universe.”    </p>    <p>      <strong>Siting and Planning</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here are the main factors to evaluate before building your      own pond.    </p>        <p>      Topography. As in real estate, there are three secrets to      success with ponds location, location, location. Water runs      downhill, and a pond simply collects and stores water. It      is the most basic form of a reservoir. Locate your pond      where the largest storage volume can be obtained with the      least amount of earth moving.    </p>    <p>      There are two basic ways to create a pond digging a hole or      building a dam. Usually, the form is implicit in the site      to dam or to dig and the land reveals the answer, says Tim      Matson, author of Earth Ponds.    </p>    <p>      The ideal site for a dammed pond is a wet hollow located      between two steep adjacent banks, Matson says. On flat      terrain, where the water table is close to the surface, or      where a nearby stream or well can be directed to fill it, a      dugout pond works best, he says. Deeply excavated ponds      with a smaller surface area are recommended in arid areas      where evaporation losses are high and rain is scarce. But      often the answer is a combination of methods, a      dug-and-dammed pond. Matson says this strategy is most      favored in rolling terrain, where excavation of the pond      basin will yield enough earth for the embankment.    </p>        <p>      Soil Types. Deep, well-drained soil with lots of sand and      gravel may be great for farming, but it is lousy for ponds      because it doesnt hold water well. Heavier clay soil, on      the other hand, holds water much better and is perfect for      ponds.    </p>    <p>      You can learn about your soil with free help from your      county Extension office or district office of the Natural      Resources Conservation Service. (Look in the government      section of your phone book.) Experts there can recommend      excavation contractors; explain laws governing      pond-building; and give advice on siting, building,      managing and stocking your pond. Also, be sure to ask if      they can help you get a free copy of an excellent resource,    </p>    <p>      Ponds Planning, Design, Construction, handbook No. 590 from      the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The      water-holding capacity of less-than-perfect soil can easily      be increased by compacting the soil with heavy equipment,      adding clay blankets, using sealers such as bentonite (a      fine-textured colloidal clay) or using chemical dispersing      agents that include sodium chloride (table salt) and soda      ash. Some small ponds can be lined with heavy plastic or      rubber sheets.    </p>    <p>      Water Sources. Your geographic location, the source of your      water (surface runoff, a spring, a stream or a well and      pump) and its reliability will largely determine the size      and depth of your pond. For example, ponds in wet and humid      Eastern, Southern and Pacific Northwestern states can be      relatively shallow 5 to 7 feet deep according to the USDA.      In the dry to arid regions of the West and Southwest, the      minimum recommended depth is 8 to 14 feet.    </p>        <p>      For ponds that depend solely on surface runoff, the size of      the watershed drainage area surrounding the pond is a      critical factor. To fill a one-acre pond in Ohio to a depth      of 5 feet, you may only need a watershed of 15 acres,      according to the USDA. In western Kansas, though, it may      take 175 acres to provide enough water; in arid Western      states it may take 300 to 500 acres.    </p>    <p>      Costs. Unless you pull a Nearing and dig your pond by hand,      hiring a bulldozer to build even a modest pond will cost      $3,000 to $5,000. Sometimes government agencies will share      the cost through watershed restoration and conservation      projects ask about local programs. Just be aware of any      strings attached, such as a requirement that your pond be      kept open to the public.    </p>    <p>      Legal Issues. In the past, property owners could dig a pond      anywhere on their land, and many people constructed ponds      in wetland areas low-lying spots that already collected      water. But more recently, the public has realized the value      of wetlands for wildlife habitat and maintaining water      quality, so there now are regulations that limit where you      can put a farm pond.    </p>    <p>      If you construct a pond without acquiring the proper      permits, you could find yourself in court, faced with heavy      fines and huge wetland-restoration bills and worse yet, no      pond. You can avoid this issue by choosing a pond site with      care and following local regulations.    </p>    <p>      Matson says the ideal pond is one that already exists and      is maybe 20 to 30 years old and just needs to be cleaned      out. If you have an old pond site on your property, its      well worth taking the trouble to clean it up, rather than      negotiating permits and incurring the expense for a new      one. (See New Life for Old Ponds, above, for more on      resurrecting an old pond.)    </p>    <p>      Maintenance. Keep your pond surrounded by large grassy      areas to prevent soil from washing into the pond from      nearby fields. Also keep in mind that the ponds own water      can cause soil erosion. Wind-whipped waves can eat away at      a ponds banks, dam and spillway. Common solutions include      breaking up waves with an obstacle such as a floating log      boom, or building rock-lined banks called riprap which work      well where the water level fluctuates widely. Keep      livestock out of your pond as much as possible, both to      prevent erosion and to maintain water quality.    </p>    <p>      Safety Concerns. Its important to exercise caution while      enjoying a pond. Anyone especially young children can drown      in a pond or get caught in a whirlpool, which can form at      the ponds drainpipe. Diving into shallow water can lead to      serious injury. Exercise additional caution if you want to      use the pond in winter people can break through if the ice      is too thin. Make sure all family members and visitors      know, and follow, proper safety procedures. Keep basic      lifesaving devices handy, including ring buoys, ropes and      poles, or long planks and ladders for ice rescues. If your      pond will be open to the public, make sure you have      adequate liability insurance. To keep the public out, some      pond owners opt to fence their ponds and/or post No      Trespassing signs.    </p>    <p>      Build for the Future. Given the increasing trend of severe      weather, Matson says ponds need to be built better than      ever. The construction of pond dams must take into      consideration potential flood damage should the dam or      overflow-spillway channel fail. It is even more important      to build ponds with spillways that can handle what they      used to call 50- or 100-year floods, Matson says. With      continuing climate changes, you really want to make the      dams sturdy and make spillways function properly with large      water loads.    </p>        <p>      <strong>safety and Self-Reliance</strong>    </p>    <p>      Rural fire departments count on ponds in the same way urban      firefighters depend on fire hydrants. Getting a pumper      truck close enough to a pond is often a problem, especially      in bad weather, so many pond owners install a dry hydrant,      a 4- to 6-inch-diameter plastic sewer pipe, to provide a      quick and reliable hose connection. Have a conversation      with your local fire department, Matson says. There may be      some financial support from the state, or a tax or      insurance break [to help with the cost of building or      improving a pond].    </p>    <p>      Ponds have long been considered an essential tool for      country living, enhancing a self-reliant lifestyle. A pond      is a wonderful combination of things, incorporating many      aspects of self-sufficiency, starting with your own food      and water, Matson says.    </p>    <p>      Ponds also can be useful resources during blackouts or      other emergencies: Buckets of water from the pond can be      used to flush toilets; and if the ponds water is clear and      clean, it can be used for bathing. If you decide to build a      pond, the resources listed on Page 56 will give you a      better understanding of the siting, planning and building      factors necessary to create your own special spot.?d    </p>    <p>      George DeVault grew up beside a half-acre farm pond in      Ohio. There he enjoyed fishing, boating, ice skating,      hunting frogs and, when his parents werent looking, skinny      dipping.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        New Life for Old Ponds      </h3>            <p>        “Earth ponds flow naturally toward oblivion,”        says pond expert Tim Matson. “Vegetation decays,        sediment accumulates and the basin erodes. Eventually,        without help, the pond disappears.” (Read        Matson’s article “Maintaining Your        Pond,” at www.MotherEarthNews.com.)      </p>      <p>        Nevertheless, it is possible to revitalize an old pond.        Take, for example, the experience of Keith Crotz, a now        proactive pond-keeper in central Illinois. The pond on        his farm was 24 feet deep when his late grandfather,        William, built it for fishing in 1962. Thirty-five years        later, the one-acre pond was practically dead. “The        pond had pretty much filled in because of poor farming        practices,” Keith says. “The silt came off of        our land, which was plowed, disked and harrowed,        regardless of the weather. In 1997, we dredged out about        20 feet of silt, rebuilt the dike and put in a new drain        and overflow.”      </p>      <p>        Crotz still raises corn, soybeans and wheat on the farm        that has been in his family since the 1860s, but he no        longer worries about soil erosion filling his pond.        “Now that we’re no-till and organic, we        don’t have those problems.” A 100-foot-wide        grass buffer also encircles his pond. The U.S. Department        of Agriculture picked up most of the cost for reviving        the pond as part of a watershed-protection program; Crotz        had to pay for only 20 percent of the project’s        total cost.      </p>      <p>        Now the reborn pond is full of bass, bluegill and        bullfrogs, and attracts a variety of other wildlife. With        an electric pump, the pond keeps a livestock water tank        filled and provides plenty of irrigation water for a        one-acre market garden.      </p>    </div>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Resources      </h3>      <p>        <strong>BOOKS</strong><br />        Ponds – Planning, Design, Construction<br />        Agriculture Handbook No. 590, available free from the        USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.<br />        www.nrcs.usda.gov      </p>      <p>        Earth Ponds: The Country Pond Maker’s Guide to        Building, Maintenance<br />        and Restoration<br />        By Tim Matson<br />        www.MotherEarthShopping.com      </p>      <p>        Earth Ponds Sourcebook: The Pond Owner’s Manual and        Resource Guide<br />        By Tim Matson<br />        See Page 158 to order.</p>			<p>	        <strong>WEB SITES</strong><br />        Ohio Department of Natural Resources<br />        www.dnr.state.oh.us/wildlife/Fishing/pond/<br />        construction.htm      </p>      <p>        Virginia Cooperative Extension<br />        www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/fisheries/<br />        420-011/420-011.html      </p>      <p>        www.earthponds.com<br />        Tim Matson’s Web site.      </p>      <p>        <strong>VIDEO</strong><br />        Tim Matson’s Earth Ponds Video<br />        An introduction to pond design<br />        and construction.<br />        www.MotherEarthShopping.com      </p>    </div>

Then fill the trench with well-compacted dense material. To prevent the dam from washing out during heavy rains, install a vertical overflow pipe and horizontal spillway pipe with anti-seep collars (to prevent leaks from developing along the pipes) at the base of the dam. The top of the overflow pipe should be about 21/2 feet below the top of the dam. After the pipes are installed, dig soil from the pond area and construct the dam over the core trench, with the front (water) side of the dam at a 3:1 slope and the back of the dam at a 2:1 slope.
