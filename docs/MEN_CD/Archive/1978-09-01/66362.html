                <p>      Kansas State University veterinarian Randy Kidd says, "It's      not as difficult as you might have thought to give a      medical injection to either a pet or a barnyard brute."    </p>        <p>      If you hate, detest, or just plain fear being on the      receiving end of THE NEEDLE as much as I do, you'll      probably be surprised to learn that giving medical      injections to livestock is a fairly simple process. In      fact-when dealing with birds or animals that can be      easily restrained-injections are often the simplest      and best way to administer most kinds of medication.      Furthermore, if the job is done properly, the beasts hardly      seem to mind at all . . . at least they don't carry on the      way I do when I'm on the receiving end of the procedure.    </p>    <h3>      KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING    </h3>    <p>      On the other hand-easy or not-jabbing a foreign      substance into any living creature is a serious act. As      well as a potentially dangerous one (incorrect      medication-administered incompetently-can kill      an animal far more quickly than will most diseases).    </p>    <p>      Before attempting to give any sick bird or animal any kind      of injection, then, make sure you know what you're doing      and that you have correctly diagnosed the ailment you're      trying to treat. And, if you have any doubts on either of      these scores (that you know what you're doing or that your      diagnosis is correct), consult your vet and be ready to pay      for his good advice before you proceed any further.    </p>    <p>      Then-and only then-obtain the recommended      medication and read its label . . . SEVERAL TIMES. It's an      interesting thing about labels: They usually contain      information on dosages and correct      administration-almost everything, in fact, that you      need to know about a drug, vaccine, etc.-which, if      followed, will keep you from misusing the products they      describe.    </p>    <p>      Once again, then, please remember that the science of      medicine is not an area of human activity that often      forgives sloppiness in any form. And that goes double for      the specific practices of medicine discussed in this      article: Even the correct medicine wrongly injected can be      fatal. Make sure you know exactly what you're doing before      you fill that first syringe or touch that first needle to      skin.    </p>        <h3>      BUY THE PROPER EQUIPMENT    </h3>    <p>      Your local Yellow Pages probably lists one or more      veterinary supply houses. Most all of the equipment you'll      need will be available from one of these sources . . . just      know what you're after before you go in to make a purchase      and you'll have no reason to feel "out of place" while      you're there.    </p>    <p>      First off, you'll need a syringe . . . the "plunger" that      both holds the medication, serum, or vaccine and "pumps" it      into your "patient's" hide. Syringes vary in size from tiny      tuberculin (or insulin) types to monsters with a capacity      of 60 cubic centimeters (cc's) or more.    </p>    <p>      Most vaccines-since they're given in small      quantities, even to quite large animals-can be      handled with a 2- to 6cc "hypo". You'll also need a 12- to      20cc syringe for administering antibiotics to goats, sheep,      horses, cattle, etc. And that's about as far as you'll have      to go with syringes: The really big ones-the 35- to      60-cc brutes-are just too unwieldy for the novice . .      . it's best to let your vet handle any shots requiring that      much medicine.    </p>    <p>      Probably your best bets when buying syringes are the      commonly available plastic disposable models. Since these      are discarded after each use, the risk of infection from      improper cleaning is just about nil (careless handling,      however, could contaminate a brand-new syringe). The      throwaways, also, are inexpensive enough to be a logical      choice for the beginner . . . and-because of their      sanitary nature-are preferred by most vets, too.    </p>    <p>      Glass syringes, or steel syringe jackets with replaceable      glass barrels, are the "top of the line" alternative to the      disposables. Their main advantage is that they'll likely      last until you lose them. On the other hand, they do have a      major disadvantage too: If you don't clean 'em properly      between each and every use, they can infect an animal and      make it sicker after treatment than it was before.    </p>    <p>      The business end of your injecting outfit is the needle, or      point. This fits onto (it usually screws on) the syringe      and, since it's the path that medications follow to get      from the syringe and into a patient's body, the needle is      likely the one piece of shot-giving equipment that you      already (ouch!) know all about.    </p>    <p>      Since points are available in a whole range of types (they      vary in both length and bore diameter) there is no one      allpurpose size. For big critters (cattle, horses, large      goats and sheep, etc.) you'll want needles 1-1/2 inches      long . . . while 3/4 inchers will do the job for house pets      and other smaller beasts. The bores (diameters) of these      stickers are described by gauge numbers and, as in      shotguns, a larger gauge means a smaller diameter. Use a      16- to 18-gauge point for your large "patients" (their      muscle contractions could snap a smaller needle in two!).      Littler beasties (dogs, cats, small goats, and the like)      require something more in the 20- to 22-gauge range. And,      just in case you're wondering, the needles that have left      you lying on your stomach with your tender behind exposed      were probably no more than 23 or 25 gauge.    </p>    <p>      I recommend disposable needles to any beginner (and to most      everyone else). The risk of infection from a "dirty" needle      is nothing to mess with, especially when the cheap      throwaway types can all but eliminate this danger.    </p>    <p>      In fact, even if you do decide to try the reusable      stainless steel needles that are available, you'll have to      check them for sharpness before every use and replace 'em      if they're the least bit dulled. A dull point can be a real      pain-both for the animal and the      shot-giver-because it's quite difficult to get an      unhoned tip through a beast's tough skin.    </p>    <p>      So, at the risk of belaboring a very important thought: If      you choose to buy reusable needles or syringes, you are      accepting (automatically!) the very serious responsibility      of keeping that equipment clean and safe. This is one      case-at least in my professional opinion-where      throwaways definitely are better.    </p>              <h3>        STERILIZATION (YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT CLEANLINESS)      </h3>      <p>        You should know from the beginning that no sterilization        process is foolproof . . . the best you can do is take        every step possible to approach that unreachable        perfection.      </p>      <p>        Heat sterilization, however, comes pretty close to doing        a complete job. Simply cook your syringe and/or        needle-if, despite my recommendations, you've        decided to stock up on the reusable steel and glass        models-in a 250-degree(F) pressure cooker-at 15        pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure-for 20        minutes. As a better-than-nothing alternative you can        boil your equipment in a regular pot for thirty minutes .        . . but this treatment won't kill any bacterial spores.      </p>      <p>        Chemical disinfectants can be very effective, but they        carry a built-in problem of their own. A residue of the        cleaning chemical could inactivate the vaccine, medicine,        etc., that you plan to use. Because of this possibility        there are no perfect chemical disinfectants ... though        some are effective when handled properly. That "properly"        translates as using the correct dilution of the chemical,        keeping the items to be cleaned in contact with the        solution for a long enough period, and removing the        residual disinfectant in an adequate manner.      </p>      <p>        The quaternary ammonium compounds-such as Roccal,        Cetavlon, Desogen, and Bradol-are all good. You can        find these (usually) in any restaurant supply house. The        "ammonias" will eliminate a whole slew of bacteria and        some viruses when used for at least one minute at a        concentration of 200 parts per million (ppm). (Five        tablespoons of Roccal-for example-in one        gallon of water will give you that 200-ppm dilution.)        These products, by the way, don't lose their strength        rapidly . . . which is fortunate because they tend to be        expensive.      </p>      <p>        Quanadine derivatives (such as Nolvasan) have about the        same advantages and disadvantages as do the quaternary        ammonias, and should be used at a one percent        concentration for at least one minute.      </p>      <p>        Iodine or iodophores can also do the job. At 25 ppm,        iodine will handle some bacteria . . . but 400 to 600        ppm, and a contact time of several hours, will be        required to knock off especially resistant bacterial        strains. (Remember that a onepercent solution is        equivalent to 10,000 ppm.)      </p>      <p>        Probably the easiest disinfectant to use (and the most        practical) is plain old household bleach. It kills most        bacteria-even the sporicidal types-and is        effective against almost all viruses. Use it at 200 ppm        with one minute of contact time. (If you mix 1/2 ounce of        Clorox-which is a 5.25-percent sodium        hypochloride-into a gallon of water, you will        produce approximately a 200-ppm solution.)      </p>      <p>        Bleaches, however, have one major disadvantage: They        dissipate rapidly. So, if you use them, mix up a new        batch each time you disinfect. (This rapid dissipation,        by the way, is actually a plus . . . since simple air        drying or a quick rinse in sterile [boiled] water will        assure you that the bleach will not affect your medicine.        Remember, though: Never leave any metal items floating in        a bleach solution . . . since it'll corrode them.)      </p>      <h3>        How To Fill A Syringe      </h3>      <p>        No matter how perfect your technique, you can't give a        shot until you get the medicine out of its bottle and        into the syringe. Like most things, this process is easy        as fallin' in a crick . . . once you know how.      </p>            <p>        First and foremost, IS YOUR SYRINGE CLEAN? "Clean" means        not only disinfected but also free from the disinfectant        residue itself.      </p>      <p>        The traditional method of filling a syringe requires that        you [1] shake the bottle of medicine, [2] hold it upside        down, [3] force the needle through the stopper, and [4]        fill the syringe by pulling back on the plunger. It is        then best to [5] replace the filling needle with another        sterilized point before making the injection.      </p>      <p>        For a quicker fill-up, proceed as above but pull the        plunger back before inserting the needle into the bottle.      </p>      <p>        Then hold the bottle upside down and force a bit of air        into the container, pull back again on the plunger to        draw out some liquid, and repeat this pumping process        until the syringe is filled.      </p>      <p>        And finally: Always be sure to expel any air in the        syringe or needle by holding it point up and squirting        out a tiny bit of medicine before making your injection.      </p>      <h3>        RESTRAIN THE BEAST      </h3>      <p>        The first (and most important) aspect of administering an        injection is animal restraint. [For a thorough treatment        of this subject, see Dr. Kidd's article, "Restrain That        Beast", pages 84-87, MOTHER NO. 52-THE EDITORS.]        Trying to treat an unrestrained beast is like trying to        change a tire on a moving auto . . . you're as likely to        get run over as you are to accomplish the job you set out        to do.      </p>      <p>        Smaller critters can be held by an assistant while you        stick 'em. Remember, though, that an animal's (or a        man's, as I can attest) normal response to a sharp object        in the rump is to buck, jump, kick, and just generally        get the hell away from the pain. It helps to be ready for        the inevitable.      </p>      <p>        Sometimes one person can both hold and inject a small        goat, calf, or some such by forcing the little feller or        gal against a sturdy fence with a knee while giving him        or her a shot in the neck or thigh. A full-sized cow or        bull, on the other hand, will require careful restraint        techniques. Cattle should be held in a chute or tied to a        strong fencepost . . . and forced against the fence        itself by a helper. Use a substantial halter or nose lead        on each of the larger brutes . . . and tie the animal to        a sturdy fencepost rather than the fencing boards or        wire. I've seen bulls snap the rope right off a nose        lead, and I've watched (usually angrily) while cattle        walked through 2 X 4 planks or barbed wire like it wasn't        even there.      </p>      <p>        When there's no alternative you can sometimes take your        "patient's" mind off his or her problems with a large        mouthful of some particularly favored food. This is        possible because many animals can't think over the noise        of a growling stomach . . . a handicap that is not        unknown in human beings.      </p>      <p>        OK. Once you've provided yourself with a stationary        target, it's time to clean the injection site. To        completely disinfect a portion of an animal's anatomy        you'd have to shave it and then soak the area in a        70percent alcohol solution for several hours. Unless        you're crazier than most folks, however, you'll settle        for something short of perfection. Adequate cleansing can        be accomplished by mechanically removing any dirt or crud        with soap and water first, and then washing the site        again with the alcohol solution.      </p>      <p>        Now then. It's a good idea-at this point-to        take a minute to "think the way the critter thinks". It's        almost certainly going to try to escape the hurt . . .        and, since you've restrained the animal and made flight        impossible, it just might make an attempt to kick the        pain away.      </p>      <p>        Sound medical practice dictates that one should avoid        getting his own leg broken while injecting medication        into a beast's caboose region. Station yourself north of        any possible southbound hooves by placin' your body        firmly against the animal's side or flank area.      </p>      <p>        Likewise, when a shot is given in the neck region, the        front hooves become the logical means of protest. In such        a case, press yourself close to the beastie's shoulder        before injecting away.      </p>      <h3>        KNOW THE TYPE OF INJECTION NEEDED      </h3>      <p>        If you've paid attention so far, you're finally ready for        the needle process itself. Human docs practice their        technique on oranges, but an animal's hide is tougher        than the gnarliest citrus fruit that ever came out of        Florida. Old footballs, basketballs, or medicine balls        would be more appropriate practice items.      </p>      <p>        There are several basic ways to give a shot . . . and, as        with most things that employ medical terminology, each of        these has an abbreviation to further confuse the        neophyte.      </p>      <h3>        INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTIONS      </h3>      <p>        Intramuscular (I.M.) injections are given deep into the        muscle tissue itself. Other than the intravenous        injectionwhich I'll explain later-the I.M.        injection is the quickest and most efficient way to get        medication into the system.      </p>      <p>        However, some of the medicines created for I.M.        administration can-if not buried deeply enough in        the tissue-cause the formation of large lumps of        abscesses at the site of the injection. Because of this        danger the potential shot-giver must know where the large        muscle masses are on any animal being treated . . . and        he must have a needle of sufficient length (1-1/2 inches        for the bigger brutes) to reach deeply enough into that        tissue. The sites most commonly chosen for this type of        shot are the neck, the thigh, and the rump.      </p>      <p>        The neck area is best treated with caution when I.M.        injections are being considered. Small animals (sheep,        goats, and on down . . .) might not have enough muscles        in that part of their bodies to safely contain large        doses (10 cc's or more) of medication. Also, you should        completely understand the beast's neck anatomy before you        start poking things into it. The jugular vein runs along        the bottom third of the neck-near the        surface-in the jugular furrow, and the vertebrae        run approximately down the mid-portion. NO I.M. INJECTION        MUST EVER BE MADE INTO EITHER OF THESE AREAS.      </p>      <p>        The thigh is the logical muscle mass to use for any        intramuscular shot . . . if you're sure the animal you're        treating won't kick the slats out of the barn when you        poke him or her. Sheep and goats are thus good prospects        for a thigh I.M., cows and horses are decidedly not.      </p>      <p>        The large concentration of muscle in the        rump-between the pin bones and the hip and        equidistant from the vertebrae and the thurls-makes        a good injection site . . . particularly for large feisty        critters.      </p>      <p>        No matter where you give it, though, the I.M. injection        goes easiest when you follow a special technique. Remove        the needle from the syringe and hold the needle between        your first finger and thumb . . . just like a dart. You        can then desensitize the critter's hide by giving it a        few sharp slaps with the back or heel of your        needle-holding hand. This sequence of swats should be        rapid and hard enough so the numbing effect of the blows        isn't lost. The entire process resembles an old Laurel        and Hardy movie: slap, slap, slap, stick! That "stick" is        when you turn your hand around or drop it down and drive        the needle through the desensitized skin and into the        mass of muscle clear up to its shoulder. Animal        injections are not for the timid.      </p>      <p>        If your beast is going to kick up a fuss, it'll usually        do so when it's stuck. Then, after the "patient" calms        down you can attach the syringe to the alreadyinserted        needle. Remember, though, that the syringe should be FULL        of liquid (to overflowing) and that care must be taken to        ensure that NO air is forced into the animal with the        fluid. Also, BEFORE making the I.M. injection you should        always draw back on the plunger slightly to be sure you        haven't hit a vein (if blood appears in the chamber of        your syringe, withdraw the needle from the animal and        start over again). Then-after the vaccine,        antibiotic, or whatever has been injected-it's        always good practice to withdraw the needle quickly and        rub or pinch the site to help prevent any leakage of the        medication.      </p>      <h3>        INTRAVENOUS INJECTIONS      </h3>      <p>        Intravenous (I.V.) injections are given into a vein        instead of into a muscle. This method should not be        attempted by a novice without expert instruction . . .        there are just too many dangerous ways for an intravenous        injection to go wrong.      </p>      <p>        For instance: To give a proper I.V. you must know exactly        where the vein is that you want to hit. Your needle then        must be threaded into the vein and must remain there        throughout the whole injection process. (A breath of        fresh air might be prescribed at this point for squeamish        readers.) Many of the medicines and whatnot intended for        I.V. administration are damaging to bodily tissues, and        can cause tissue neurosis or tissue sloughing if        inadvertently injected outside the blood vessel. Remember        also !hat an artery runs alongside each vein . . . and        some I.V. medications can be lethal when introduced into        an artery. If, however, you find-for some        reason-that you absolutely must administer an        intravenous injection, the following tips should prove        helpful:      </p>      <p>        On larger animals the jugular vein is the most common        intravenous injection site. To find this vein press your        thumb into the jugular furrow near the juncture of the        animal's neck and shoulder (below the location of the        intended shot). If you do this properly, you'll be able        to watch the vein distend itself along the length of the        furrow.      </p>      <p>        Then, while the blood vessel is held distended, direct an        18-gauge, 1-1/2-inch needle (up to a 14-gauge can be used        for horses and cows, but, since too much medicine        injected overly quickly can cause shock, the smaller        needle helps prevent this) at a right angle to the neck        and thrust it firmly into the vein. If you do this        correctly, a steady drip of blood from the needle's base        will soon assure you that its point isindeedinside the        vein. That's the signal to maintain your thumb pressure        while you push the business end of your "hypo" parallel        to the vein and in the direction of the beast's chest.        Seat the needle up to its shoulder in the lumen (the        hollow center) of the jugular. Blood should continue to        drip from the needle during this process.      </p>      <p>        Attach the FILLED TO OVERFLOWING syringe to the needle,        draw its plunger back slightly to make absolutely sure        that no air is trapped in either the needle or syringe        and that they contain only blood and the medication which        will be injected. Make the injection, remove the needle,        and pinch the injection site to prevent leakage. (It's a        good idea, too, after giving the I.V., to release the        pressure on the vein and then apply it again-until        blood appears in the syringe-to prevent any fluid        from oozing out into the surrounding tissues when the        needle is withdrawn.)      </p>      <h3>        SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS      </h3>      <p>        Subcutaneous (Sub-Q) shots are simply injected under        (sub) the skin (cutis). These can be administered        anywhere that there's a loose fold of skin. Common sites        include the hind flank, in the front "armpit",        and-in pigs-behind the ears.      </p>      <p>        To give a Sub-Q you pinch the skin-lift it away        from the body-and stick the needle into the pocket        thus created between the two epidermal layers. Always be        sure that your thrust (you did have your eyes open,        didn't you?) hasn't gone right on through and out the        other side (medicine injected onto the ground isn't very        therapeutic to an animal). By moving the needle tip        around slightly after inserting it you can usually tell        if it's in the pocket.      </p>      <p>        Medicines that can be administered Sub-Q are neither        absorbed as rapidly nor as completely as I.M. injections.        ONLY MEDICATION LABELED FOR SUBCUTANEOUS USE SHOULD BE SO        INJECTED . . . others could cause nasty ulcerations.      </p>      <h3>        INTRA-PERITONEAL INJECTIONS      </h3>      <p>        Occasionally, it may be necessary to give large amounts        of fluid to a sick creature. Often these quantities are        best given intraperitoneally (I.P.). That is, the fluid        is injected into the stomach cavity where it is then        absorbed by the peritoneum lining.      </p>      <p>        The trick in I.P. shots is to get the liquid into the        cavity and not into the intestines. Luckily, goats,        sheep, and cattle have a ready-made area for needle        insertion ... the right paralumbar fossa. This is a        triangular area lying between the hipbone (the forward        bone of the pelvis) and the last rib . . . with the        vertebrae forming an upper boundary. Only the right side        of the animal is used because a large part of any        ruminant's stomach (the rumen) lies on the left side and        could be injured by an injection there.      </p>      <p>        A 1-1/2- to 2-inch, 16- or 18-gauge needle is used for        I.P. shots, and is thrust directly into the fossa at an        angle perpendicular to the critter's body.      </p>      <p>        BE CAUTIOUS: Some I.P. medications can-in extreme        cases-be toxic enough to cause peritonitis. All        fluids given in this manner should be warmed to body        temperature (but no medication or needle should ever be        used that is warmer than the temperature of the beast to        be treated), and only medicines (or vaccines, etc.)        designed for I.P. use should be so administered. If you        have any doubts (about anything connected with animal        injections), check with your vet.      </p>      <h3>        THE END (APPROPRIATELY)      </h3>      <p>        Well, that's the process . . . from the equipment-buying        beginning to the needle in the behind. With reasonable        caution and the methods outlined here, most routine        vaccines and medications can be readily and inexpensively        administered to almost any kind of livestock by anyone        who has a few critters do his or her place. Who knows,        the practice might even make getting an injection        yourself a little less traumatic. Still, for my        money-at least when it comes to shots-it's        definitely better to give than to receive.      </p>      <h3>        WANT TO KNOW MORE      </h3>      <p>        Further information on medicating your own farm animals        by injection can be found in the following sources:      </p>      <p>        1.
