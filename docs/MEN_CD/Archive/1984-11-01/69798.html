                <p>      Preventing nuclear war is the most important ecological,      political, and moral issue of our time.    </p>        <p>      The facts are these. One: Nuclear war would be the most      devastating holocaust the world has ever known. It's even      possible that an atomic Armageddon would eliminate life on      this planet. Two: The chances for nuclear warwhether      accidental or deliberate-are currently increasing because      the two superpowers are starting to move from a      <em>deterrence</em> capability to a <em>first-strike      stance</em> . . . that is, from weapons that are most      effective as defensive guardians of one's own nation to      those that, by design, would be most-or, in some cases,      only-effective if used to <em>initiate a</em> global      war.<br />      On the other hand, although all of us often feel      overwhelmed and powerless in the face of this massive      threat, only <em>all of us</em> can deter it. So we've      provided an analysis of what individuals can do to help      prevent a nuclear war.<br />      We will begin at the <em>end-by discussing</em> the atomic      holocaust itself. Ignoring the possible consequences of      such a conflict-just because they aren't pleasurable to      think about-is a sure way to increase the chances that we      will have to face them.<br />      <br />      <strong>Part I: The Consequences of Nuclear      War</strong><br />      <br />      Nearly all the nuclear weapons in strategic arsenals are      fission-fusion-fission devices, capable of vastly greater      explosive power than either of the two weapons that were      dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A fissionable plutonium      device fuses deuterium and tritium (these isotopes of      hydrogen give such a weapon the name <em>hydrogen      bomb),</em> which in turn causes a shell of uranium to      fission. With this methodology, weapons with power equal to      that of more than 20,000,000 tons (20 megatons) of TNT have      been exploded. For comparison, the first fission explosion      at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, yielded about      20,000 tons (20 kilotons) of TNT equivalent. The Hiroshima      and Nagasaki bombs were about 13 and 22 kilotons,      respectively.<br />      <br />      Most of the strategic weapons poised for use by the two      superpowers are not the tremendously powerful multimegaton      devices, though. The arsenals consist largely of bombs that      would yield between 200 kilotons and one megaton in      explosive potential, though a few of the antiquated very      large bombs are still deployed. Improved accuracy has made      the huge weapons generally unnecessary for striking      protected targets, and a blanket attack with several small      weapons is expected to be more effective against urban or      industrial areas than a single very large bomb would be. In      fact, eight 40-kiloton bombs, equal to 320,000 tons of TNT,      would wipe out as much area as would a single 1-megaton      weapon that's the equivalent of 1,000,000 tons.<br />      <br />      <strong>WAR</strong><br />      <br />      To estimate what the effects of an all-out nuclear war      might be, some assumptions must be made about how and when      it would take place: how many weapons, what targets,      whether the warheads burst in the air or on the ground,      what wind patterns prevail, what time of day, etc. In      <em>The Aftermath: The Human and Ecological Consequences of      Nuclear War,</em> the Ambio Advisory Group of the Royal      Swedish Academy of Sciences describes one possible      scenario. The attack takes place at 11:00 AM New York time      (6:00 PM Moscow time) on a weekday in June and involves the      use of about half of the available arsenals: 14,747      warheads of about 5,742 megatons. Ground bursts are used      for 4,970 warheads (1,941 megatons) targeted at cities in      the Northern Hemisphere, 3,136 bombs (701 megatons) are      detonated in the air over industrial and energy targets in      both hemispheres, 6,620 weapons totaling 2,960 megatons are      exploded on the ground at military targets (including      civilian airports that can handle jets), and 21 warheads of      140 megatons are used to close maritime straits.<br />      <br />      All cities of greater than 100,000 population in the      Northern Hemisphere and greater than 500,000 in the      Southern Hemisphere are targets, and the scientists      estimate that more than half of those urban residents-in      the neighborhood of 750,000,000 peoplewould die from the      immediate blast, thermal, and radiation effects, and      340,000,000 would be injured. This coincides with the      estimates of other scientific teams that in a war involving      about half of the available strategic warheads, between      750,000,000 and 1,250,000,000 people will die in short      order.<br />      <br />      And what of those who survive the immediate effects of the      war? Clouds of radioactive dust will spread downwind from      the locations of ground bursts-notably the sites of missile      silos. In the U.S., many of the roughly 100,000,000 people      who survive the initial attack will be killed by the      radioactivity within four days of the conflagration. At      least 600 rems will fall on most of North and South Dakota,      Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska; on much of Delaware, Indiana,      Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts,      Michigan, Montana, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, and      Wyoming; and on parts of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,      Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Tennessee,      Texas, and Vermont . . . from an attack just on U.S.      strategic missile silos. This amount of radiation will kill      more than half of those exposed. Hot spots, where the      fallout will quickly be lethal to most of those exposed,      will occur from unpredictable events such as rainstorms.      Those affected will perish from burns to the skin or from      drinking contaminated water.<br />      <br />      After the initial week, the number of <em>new</em>      casualties from fallout will drop considerably, but the      nuclear debris will continue to keep the land in the      Northern Hemisphere blanketed in radiation for centuries.      In fact, the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere      could receive an average dose of 50 rads: Most of the      cropland in the Midwest and across the middle- and      northeastern U.S. will be too radioactive to allow farming.      According to Ambio, if all North Americans stay indoors in      the weeks after the attack, 17,000,000 are still likely to      die from acute radiation exposure . . . most of them in the      U.S. Three percent of the survivors will become sterile,      another 1 °7o will die of cancer within 20 years, and      the descendants of another 1% will suffer genetic defects      within two generations. Across the Atlantic, the entirety      of Europe will be so contaminated as to require complete      evacuation-an option that would be impossible after nuclear      war.<br />      <br />      Radiation will not take the majority of lives after a      nuclear war, though. Tens of millions of people in the U.S.      alone will be injured, many of them with severe burns. Most      hospitals and nearly all burn centers are located in urban      areas, and it is estimated that <em>70%</em> of the      facilities will be destroyed and their doctors killed. In      any event, power won't be available to operate any      sophisticated medical equipment that survives the attack.      Disease and infection are likely to become rampant: Some      estimate that as many as 45,000,000 of the survivors of the      attack on the U.S. will die within the first year from      cholera, malaria, plague, shigellosis, typhoid fever,      yellow fever, tuberculosis, etc.    </p>        <p>      <strong>THE AFTERMATH</strong><br />      <br />      Nonetheless, some U.S. (and, no doubt, Soviet) residents      <em>are</em> likely to survive. But what will conditions be      like? To begin with, food, clean water, and medical      attention will be very hard to come by. Most of the crops      standing in fields will be too contaminated to eat, and      range animals will either die from radiation exposure or      have high radiation levels both from direct fallout and      from eating contaminated forage. Depending on wind      direction, Iowa-which produces 100/0 of the U.S. food      supply-could have 40 to 100°70 of its area blanketed      with about 1,000 rems of<br />      <br />      radiation . . . enough to kill everything except resistant      plants and insects. And even in less affected areas, going      outside to get food from sheltered warehouses will be very      dangerous. Once immediate supplies are depleted,      transportation of food into damaged areas will be extremely      difficult, since a coordinated attack on the U.S. would      destroy at least 95% of its petroleum-refining capability      and most of the strategic reserve.<br />      <br />      Scientists of the Ambio group and the TTAPS group (an      acronym for the members' names), who announced their      findings about a "nuclear winter" just a year ago, have      calculated that as a result of the firestormsparticularly      those in urban areas but including the ignition of huge      forest areas-about 225 million tons of smoke will rise into      the atmosphere within a few days after a nuclear exchange      involving about 5,000 megatons of weapons. Within one to      two weeks, this soot will have cut levels of sunlight      reaching the earth's surface in the Northern Hemisphere to      about 1070 of the norm. Global wind patterns will      distribute the smoke, closing in previously unaffected      areas and distributing the particles into the Southern      Hemisphere, where light levels may drop to about      <strong>10%</strong> of the usual amount.<br />      <br />      Within three to four weeks of the 5,000megaton war,      Northern Hemisphere land temperatures could drop as low as      -10°F (-23°C). Temperatures will remain below      freezing on the continents for about a year. Surprisingly,      even a "limited" 100-megaton attack on cities could produce      a cooling effect nearly as severe. This is because urban      areas provide so much combustible material of a particle      size that's very effective in shielding sunlight. The      predicted drop in temperature is at least <em>10°Cten      times</em> the 1°C change that climatologists consider      to be significant. Coastal areas will be less affected than      continental centers; because of the thermal mass of the      oceans. This increase in temperature contrast between      coastal and inland zones is likely to produce heavy      precipitation along the continental margins, most of which      will fall as snow. Inland, however, very little      precipitation will fall.<br />      <br />      These conditions will have profound effects on all life.      Even plants that are capable of withstanding normally harsh      winters will be killed by the sudden <em>change</em> in      temperature. Moreover, light levels will be too low to      sustain growth. Radiation alone will wipe out about 2.5070      of the Northern Hemisphere's population of conifer trees,      which are nearly as sensitive to its effects as mammals      are.<br />      <br />      Large nuclear airbursts produce great quantities of      nitrogen oxides, which rise high into the atmosphere,      disturbing the ozone layer. Ozone is what shields us from      the full intensity of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the      sun. Though UV will be attenuated by the soot and dust in      the atmosphere for some weeks, once the skies begin to      clear, UV doses will increase by about 50 times. This will      destroy or decrease the productivity of plants that have      mariaged to survive other effects. Marine plankton      production in the very important surface waters will be      severely decreased, which will dramatically affect the      entire marine food chain. In addition, increased      ultraviolet light suppresses the immune systems of humans      and other mammals, and causes corneal damage and cataracts      in the eyes. Animals that a;e unable to shield their eyes      may become blind. It will take more than a year for the      ozone layer to return to normal levels.<br />      <br />      A further concern is the levels of pollutants in the      atmosphere after a nuclear war. Chemical facilities will be      demolished, and large quantities of toxic and carcinogenic      com pounds will circulate in the air and water.<br />      <br />      It's quite obvious that nuclear war, even of a limited      scope, would be an environmental disaster unparalleled in      human history. It's not possible to say with any confidence      whether or not any human beings would survive the longterm      effects. But it certainly is accurate to say that after a      nuclear war human societies would no longer exist in the      forms that we've known them and that the environment,      including nearly <em>all</em> ecological systems, would be      profoundly altered.<br />      <br />      <em>That is</em> what we have to avoid. Yet the arms race      has grown beyond all rational bounds. The superpowers have      a total of about 50,000 nuclear weapons (U.S. 30,000,      U.S.S.R. 20,000) . . . and the world's nuclear arsenals are      the equivalent of <em>a million</em> times the explosive      power of the Hiroshima bomb. In other words, we now have      the nuclear equivalent of four tons of TNT for every man,      woman, and child on earth.<br />      <br />      <em>Pressure and heat would directly or indirectly produce      most of the casualties if a one-megaton bomb were detonated      in the air over a typical U.S. city. 12 psi or greater (up      to 2-1/2 miles): All but the most heavily reinforced      concrete buildings are destroyed; 100% fatalities. 12 psi      to 5 psi (2-1/2 to 4-1/2 miles): Frame and brick buildings      are destroyed; combustible materials ignite spontaneously;      100% fatalities. 5 psi to 2 psi' (4-1/2 to 9 miles): Some      combustible materials ignite spontaneously; extensive      damage to buildings; third-degree burns out to about 7      miles; greater than 50% casualties. 2 psi to 1 psi (9 miles      to 13 miles): Some persons are injured by flying debris;      loss of eyesight; burn and radiation injuries; immediate      fatalities less than 25%.</em><br />      <br />      Consider the destructive potential carried by just one      Poseidon submarine. A single such ship carries more      explosive power than was used in all of World War II. It      can land the equivalent of three Hiroshimas on every Soviet      city with over 100,000 people. And we have 31 such      submarines.<br />      <br />      Nuclear deterrence may be, at present, a necessity . . .      but the <em>amount</em> of deterrence both superpowers      currently have is a potentially fatal folly. Yet-to look      just at our own country-the U.S. is building three more      nuclear bombs <em>every day.</em> The current      administration plans to add 17,000-let's write that out:      <em>seventeen thousand-more atomic</em> weapons to our      arsenal within the next decade.<br />      <br />      Amazingly enough, though, the modern world's absurd atomic      expansionism is not the major danger. Both superpowers are      currently <em>escalating</em> the arms race in a new      direction, one that will make the hair trigger of nuclear      war more sensitive than ever before . . . as you'll now      see.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Part II: From Deterrence to First      Strike</strong><br />      <br />      We've been taught that the premise of the arms race is that      nuclear war can be prevented by making the consequences of      aggression too hideous to risk. An attack by one side would      unleash a response so destructive as to leave little to      conquer in either nation. This rationale for nuclear      weapons is called <em>deterrence.</em> Horrid as the      concept is, it has a certain logic to it: The threat of an      annihilating response, combined with a significant amount      of luck, has at least kept the bomb from being used against      people since World War II.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, as you're about to see, response to a      surprise attack is no longer necessarily the purpose for      which the world's nuclear arsenals are being configured.      The doomsday machine has become a weapon for waging a      frightening political and economic world war of superiority      between the United States and the Soviet Union.<br />      <br />      In using such an awesomely destructive force for      comparatively petty ends, the world's leaders apparently      have forgotten the first rule of firearms safety: Never      point a gun at anything you don't intend to shoot. When,      not if, the inevitable happens and the nuclear guns go off,      we pawns of this chess game will become the real losers.      Today is perilously close to our last chance to understand      what the weapons are, what our leaders intend to do with      them, and what will happen if this madness continues.<br />      <br />      Both superpowers have justified huge nuclear weapons      budgets as necessary for "defense." However, as of 1984,      approximately 90% of U.S. nuclear weapons are aimed at      military targets in the Soviet Union (and we can assume      that the Russians have a similar deployment). If our      nuclear weapons exist to deter an attack by the U.S.S.R.,      why should we aim at missile silos from which the rockets      already will have been launched?<br />      <br />      The answer of course is that deterrencewhether by intention      or by default to the onward march of technology-is dead and      has been replaced by a first-strike policy. The prevailing      U.S. nuclear military strategy, as outlined in Presidential      Directive 59 of 1979 and confirmed in the Five Year Defense      Guidance Plan of 1982, is <em>counterforce,</em> which      seems to be a sort of doublespeak for first strike. This      strategy, though military planners are loath to say so      outright, clearly involves using nuclear weapons first. In      a counterforce strike, one nation-perhaps spurred by      escalating political tensions-attempts to render its      adversary's response capability useless . . . with what is      sometimes called a preemptive strike. Some military      planners, and they are apparently the ones who presently      have influence, actually believe that a nuclear war can be      initiated, fought over a protracted period, and won by      knocking out the other side's offensive weapons.<br />      <br />      <strong>MX</strong><br />      <br />      A first-strike nuclear arsenal logically consists of      weapons that are very accurate (to insure destruction of      the opponent's hardened-or protected-missile silos) and not      necessarily very resistant to attack themselves (since they      would be used first-or, at the very least, launched before      enemy missiles could reach them). The latest Department of      Defense missile, the MX, fits this description perfectly.      Its accuracy is reported to be about 300 feet over a range      of more than 7,000 miles, and talk of fitting these weapons      with special hardened silos or mobile launch sites has      largely been abandoned. Seemingly, there are only three      rationales for the MX: Either the U.S. plans to use it      first, or it plans to develop the ability to launch when      there's evidence-that Soviet rockets have been launched, or      it doesn't think that the Soviet ICBM force is a credible      threat.<br />      <br />      Of course, even a severely disabled MX system could deliver      9n awesome response to a surprise attack from the Soviet      Union. Ten of these rockets, carrying ten independently      targetable warheads each, could wipe out most of the      U.S.S.R.'s urban population and destroy its industrial      capacity . . . if that was what they were intended for. But      strategical ly, the MX is the wrong weapon for deterrence.      It would be much wiser to launch these vulnerable weapons      before they're hit. Hence the decision to respond to an      attack (evidenced by exploding nuclear weapons) becomes the      decision to launch when the enemy launches (evidenced by      satellite-borne sensors). This move to <em>launch on      warning</em> would reduce decision-making time to between      10 and 15 minutes for the U.S. and-as you'll soon see with      the Pershing II-to an even shorter time for the Soviets.      Though launch on warning isn't currently the <em>official      policy</em> in the U.S. (and probably not in the Soviet      Union either), accurate first-strike weapons, such as the      MX, dramatically increase the pressure to develop the      capability.<br />      <br />      The effect of such developments on world tension is      obvious. The MX encourages paranoia in the Soviets-because      it is so obviously best suited as an offensive, firststrike      weapon-and makes it paramount that they be able to launch a      retaliatory strike before the MX can knock out their      ICBM's. Similarly, the lack of attention to hardening (the      ability to withstand nuclear attack) encourages the U.S. to      develop the capability to launch when electronically      detected evidence shows a surprise attack. Each country      ends up with its finger more closely poised over the      button. And at the same time, the MX increases the      advantage that <em>either</em> side might gain by striking      first.<br />      <br />      Most of the other weapons that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are      now developing increase tensions in one way or another. The      following examples are U.S. systems, simply because this      country has always held a technological lead over the      U.S.S.R. But if history is any indicator, the Soviets will      be able to follow suit within a couple of years . . . and      quite likely with greater numbers of weapons.<br />      <br />      <strong>PERSHING II</strong><br />      <br />      Perhaps our most threatening weapon, from the Soviet point      of view, is the Perching II-a medium-range, very accurate      missile now being deployed in Europe. The Pershing II can      reach Moscow in six minutes and reportedly is targeted to      wipe out hardened Soviet command and control centers.      Because the Pershing has a radar-guided final approach and      is steerable, it would land so close to its target that      hardening against its blast is practically impossible.      What's more, the flight time is so short for its 1,100mile      journey that the Soviets would be allowed little time to      contemplate a response. Thus, launch on warning becomes      imperative.<br />      <br />      <strong>TRIDENT II</strong><br />      <br />      In the past, submarine-launched nuclear weapons have been      the stabilizers of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Because it's      so difficult for a sub to determine its own exact      location-a necessity for missile guidance-the weapons      haven't been accurate enough to use for attacking hardened      missile silos. Submarines are also very difficult to      detect, making a first strike to wipe them out nearly      impossible. Therefore, the best use for a submarine armed      with nuclear missiles has been to stand by to deliver a      retaliatory strike-the essence of deterrence. At this time,      however, the U.S. is preparing to deploy the Trident II      class submarines, which will have satellite-guided weapons      with accuracy sufcient to attack Soviet nuclear missile      silos. This is yet another serious threat to the Soviets      and, once again, will encourage <em>them</em> to adopt a      launchon-warning policy.<br />      <br />      <strong>AIR-LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILES</strong><br />      <br />      Because the new long-range cruise missiles take several      hours to arrive at their targets, they are in one sense      stabilizing. Unfortunately, cruise missiles are very hard      to detect, either in storage or after they have been      launched. In the past, arms limitation talks have been      based on the fact that ICBM's and intercontinental bombers      are just about impossible to <em>hide</em> from the      sensitive eyes of satellites. And submarines can be counted      as they come and go from port. Cruise missiles, however,      are little more than 20 feet long and can be transported by      light trucks, so counting them is difficult. What's more,      once they've been launched, cruise missiles travel so close      to the ground that they can't be detected by conventional      radar systems-making it hard to know when they're coming      and even harder to knock them out. Therefore, cruise      missiles make arms control verification by satellite      impossible, and effectively escalate the arms race.<br />      <br />      <strong>STAR WARS</strong><br />      <br />      In principle, at least, the space-based antimissile      weaponry of President Reagan's "Star Wars" concept could be      very destabilizing, because it would force the Soviets to      build enough weapons to overwhelm the system or to make a      first strike before the U.S. finished developing a thorough      and reliable missile defense.<br />      <br />      However, there's little possibility that Mr. Reagan's      fantasy weaponry can be developed in the near future, if      ever. To give just one opinion, MIT physicist Kosta Tsipis      has estimated that if the appropriate weapons could be      developed (an unlikely event), it would take thousands of      years for ten space shuttles to haul all the paraphernalia      into space. Thus Star Wars remains a troubling idea, but      one that's pretty much irrelevant to the immediate question      of the survival of civilization.<br />      <br />      <strong>RETHINK</strong><br />      <br />      There has been in the past a near inevitability about      nuclear arms proliferation. It's been hard to imagine that      <em>mare</em> weapons could make us <em>less</em> secure,      or that improved technology could increase the likelihood      of a nuclear war. But as you've just seen, the availability      and accuracy of today's (and tomorrow's) weapons seem to be      driving us toward doing the unthinkable again. Nonetheless,      blame doesn't need to be placed, nor do moral indictments      need to be made.<br />      <br />      Value judgments and assumptions about peoples'      personalities must be set aside when we discuss the fate of      the earth. We, the people of planet earth as a whole, are      now faced with an unwinnable situation. Neither the Soviet      Union nor the United States will ever be able to accept a      solution that permits the other nation to be dominant. And      parity, a balance of power, is practically impossible      because there seems little chance that the two nations can      adopt the same view of what strategic balance      <em>consists</em> of. On both sides, military planners,      civilian and in uniform, continue to think in terms of      warfare: fighting and winning. They have not yet faced the      fact that with nuclear weapons, combat, honor, and triumph      no longer exist. Albert Einstein said, "The unleashed power      of the atom has changed everything save our modes of      thinking, and we thus drift toward unparalleled      catastrophes." Until the fallacy of dominance is exposed,      understood, and discarded, life on earth will be in ever      greater peril.<br />      <br />      <strong>Part III: Creating Peace</strong><br />      <br />      When the Lovinses (the Plowboy interviewees of issue 88)      accepted a Right Livelihood Award in Stockholm last      December, they said. "Peace will break out when enough of      us decide we really care about peace and when we show that      in our lives."<br />      <br />      Indeed, we must each take personal responsibility for      creating peace. And whiledue to space limitations-this      article will focus only on political actions, there are      <em>many</em> ways to work for peace. As Dwight Eisenhower      once said, "People in the long run are going to do more to      promote peace than our government."<br />      <br />      <strong>LEGISLATION</strong><br />      <br />      There are four pieces of peace-related legislation      currently working their way through the halls of Congress.      (At the time of this writing-mid-August-none of them has      reached<br />      <br />      the floor of the House or Senate for a vote.) Your      continued support, by writing and phoning your elected      officials, can make a big difference in the future of these      bills.<br />      <br />      <em>[1] The Arms Race Moratorium Act.</em> The first, and      potentially most important, bill involves the new <em>quick      freeze</em> concept. The original freeze idea, that the      United States and Soviet Union should adopt "a mutual      freeze on the testing, production, and deployment of      nuclear weapons and of missiles and new aircraft designed      primarily to deliver nuclear weapons," gathered a great      deal of public support two years ago. Indeed, polls have      consistently shown that anywhere from twothirds to      <em>83°7o</em> of all Americans favor a      <em>mutual,</em> verifiable, nuclear arms freeze. But the      freeze itself got stuck in arguments about its      verifiability <em>and</em> opposition from the current      administration. To counter these two problems, peace      workers have come up with the simpler concept of quick      freeze.<br />      <br />      This first step toward a full freeze (and, of course, the      full freeze itself was always intended as a first step      toward an eventual <em>reduction</em> in nuclear arms)      focuses on the areas everyone agrees are possible to      verify: <em>testing</em> and <em>large-scale      deployment.</em> It leaves out production (which takes      place in factories and is harder to spot with spy      satellites) and the deployment of small, tactical nuclear      weapons.<br />      <br />      The quick freeze also empowers Congress to initiate the      moratorium, if the Soviets agree to it, by ceasing all      funding of the frozen areas. This skirts the possible      intransigence of a particular presidential      administration.<br />      <br />      There are two versions of this bill in Congress now: H.R.      <em>5571</em> (the House version, introduced by      Representatives Jim Leach and Edward Markey) and S.      <em>2634</em> (the Senate version, introduced by Senators      Mark Hatfield and Edward Kennedy). In addition, Senator      Claiborne Pell intends to introduce an alter native quick      freeze bill in the Senate that will differ in only a few      details.<br />      <br />      The quick freeze is intended to stop the development of      <em>first-strike</em> capability on <em>both</em> sides-the      dangers of which we've already recited in detail-while a      comprehensive freeze is being negotiated. It will be      enacted only if and as long as the Soviets comply with it.      And now is the ideal time to implement it, while there is      rough parity in weapons capacity between the superpowers .      . . so neither nation would feel itself frozen at a      disadvantage. (As the Defense Department's own      <em>1982</em> annual report states, "The U.S. and the      U.S.S.R. are roughly equal in strategic nuclear      power.")<br />      <br />      <em>[2] The Nuclear Test Ban Challenge.</em> Introduced in      the House by Representatives Barbara Boxer and Nicholas      Mavroules, H.J.RES. <em>441</em> would provide that the      U.S. simply announce to the Soviet Union that we will      suspend <em>all</em> testing of nuclear weapons and      challenge the Soviets (and other nations) to do likewise.      We would then resume testing only if the Soviets did.<br />      <br />      <em>[3]The Economic Conversion Act.</em> H.R.      <em>4805,</em> introduced by Nicholas Mavroules, would help      us move from a war- to a peacemaking economy by providing      advance notice, along with employee retraining and      temporary economic security, whenever a $10,000,000 or      greater defense contract was going to be terminated. The      act would require no additional federal funding-money saved      from canceled defense contracts would more than pay for      it!<br />      <br />      <em>[4] The National Peace Academy.</em> Last, Senate bill      <em>564</em> would provide for the establishment of a      National Peace Academy to train individuals in nonviolent      conflict resolution, negotiating skills, and other positive      ways to promote peace.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>Prevention of nuclear</strong></em>      <strong><em>war is the most</em> <em>pragmatic policy for      our</em> <em>times. We who point to</em> <em>the danger of      nuclear</em> <em>war are the realists.</em> <em>Those who      deny this</em> <em>danger, live in a dream</em>      <em>world.</em></strong><br />      <br />      <strong>-Rear Admiral<br />      Gene R. La Rocque</strong><br />      <br />      <strong>THE VOTE</strong><br />      <br />      As Dr. Helen Caldicott of Physicians for Social      Responsibility has said, "In a democracy, everyone pushes      the button." And let's face it: The simplest, most direct      way for us all to keep from pushing the button is to pull      the lover . . . for the candidates most oriented toward      peace. Sure, our defense policy is only one issue in the      November election, but can anyone deny that the survival of      our civilization-and perhaps of all life on earth-is      without doubt the most important issue? The economy, social      services, ordinary international politics-all of these die      if we do. All pale beside survival.<br />      <br />      With that in mind, MOTHER contacted both presidential      candidates' offices in early June with this question: "If      elected president, what specifically will you do to prevent      nuclear war?" After months of follow-up calls and letters      on our part, we finally got written replies from the Reagan      and Mondale camps. We also, on our own, studied both men's      records on arms control, so we could share with you the      candidates' past <em>deeds</em> as well as their present      <em>words.</em><br />      <br />      <strong>RONALD REAGAN</strong><br />      <br />      Here, in full, is Ronald Reagan's response to our      question:<br />      <br />      <em>I have no higher priority than removing the threat</em>      <em>of</em> <em>nuclear war and seeking the international      stability necessary for true and lasting peace. My      Administration is dedicated to building a safer, more      prosperous world for all peoples; one in which individual      rights are respected and democratic freedoms can flourish.      These are honorable goals, and they are shared by      freedomloving people everywhere.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Our foreign and defense policies rest on the twin      pillars</em> <em>of</em> <em>dialogue and defense-on a      search for verifiable arms reductions and on our strong      deterrent forces. We know that the chance for a secure      peace and the preservation</em> <em>of</em> <em>our      freedoms is not enhanced by weakness. But we also recognize      the importance</em> <em>of</em> <em>dialogue with our      adversaries. Though we must be honest in recognizing      differences between the United States and the Soviet Union,      we must always be willing to resolve those differences by      peaceful means.</em><br />      <br />      <em>That is why we have been working so hard to convince      the Soviet Union to join us in a spirit</em> <em>of</em>      <em>comity and cooperation to achieve real and equitable      reductions in the levels of nuclear arms. We have put      forward constructive proposals to reduce-not just      freeze-the already high levels</em> <em>of</em> <em>nuclear      arsenals by 50% in strategic ballistic missiles and by the      elimination</em> <em>of</em> <em>the most threatening      class</em> <em>of</em> <em>intermediate-range nuclear      missiles. We just concluded an agreement to improve the      U.S.-Soviet "Hotline" to reduce the risk</em> <em>of</em>      <em>misunderstanding in times</em> <em>of</em> <em>crisis,      and we have recently renewed the "Incidents at Sea"      agreement.</em><br />      <br />      <em>As part</em> <em>of</em> <em>our far-reaching arms      control agenda, we have also proposed security- and      confidencebuilding measures, as well as major reductions to      equal levels</em> <em>of</em> <em>conventional forces in      Europe; a complete and verifiable ban on chemical weapons;      improved verification</em> <em>of</em> <em>nuclear testing      limitations and other important arms control      steps.</em><br />      <br />      <em>In each</em> <em>of</em> <em>these efforts, we have      acted seriously and in good faith, and the US. has      carefully considered all proposals made by the Soviet      Union. 1 have repeatedly expressed my willingness to meet      at any time with the Soviet leadership to discuss arms      reduction proposals.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Despite all these and other initiatives, the</em><br />      <br />      <em>Soviet Union walked out of the IntermediateRange      Nuclear Force (INF) talks and has still failed to agree to      resume the Strategic Arms</em> <em>Reduction Talks (START).      We have expressed our willingness to enter into      negotiations on space-based weapons, but we regret Soviet      inaction on other strategic negotiations and remain ready      to resume talks immediately, without preconditions. In the      meantime, the United States is continuing to carry out its      obligations and commitments under previous arms control      treaties, and we are calling upon the Soviets to      demonstrate good will and restraint by doing the      same.</em><br />      <br />      <em>But the response to Soviet intransigence should not be      unilateral disarmament or a one-sided nuclear freeze. To do      that would cast doubt on the resolve of the United States      and its allies and would reward the Soviets, both for their      unparalleled military buildup of the past decade and for      refusing to negotiate. That can only encourage the Soviets      to ignore our arms control efforts, endangering our own      security and the cause</em> <em>of</em> <em>world      peace.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Instead, my Administration is committed to seeking what      has been the goal</em> <em>of</em> <em>all civilized      nations since the dawn of the nuclear age: genuine arms      control agreements and real reductions in the world's      nuclear arsenals.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Our door will remain open to all initiatives that will      reduce tensions and improve mutual understanding. We seek      to end forever the threat</em> <em>of</em> <em>nuclear war,      knowing that to do so would be to leave a legacy</em>      <em>of</em> <em>peace as the inheritance for generations to      come.</em><br />      <br />      And here are his actions in the area of arms control:<br />      <br />      * For the first time in 15 years, there are <em>no</em>      formal talks between the superpowers concerning the      limitation of any aspect of the arms race.<br />      <br />      * The current administration is pursuing the largest      escalation of the arms race in history. Military spending      has risen from $160 billion in 1981 to a projected $368      billion by 1986. The Reagan administration plans to add      17,000 more nuclear weapons (for a total of 28,000 new      warheads) to our arsenal in the next decade. And in      January, President Reagan asked for $24 billion in      additional funds for Star Wars satellite weaponry.<br />      <br />      * Reagan has loosened restrictions on the export of nuclear      fuel and technology to other countries, thus helping to      spread bombbuilding capacity to countries such as South      Africa, Argentina, and Brazil.<br />      <br />      * He has opposed the mutual, verifiable freeze in all its      forms.<br />      <br />      * And, to look at his record before he became president,      Ronald Reagan has opposed every major nuclear arms treaty      ever negoti ated-from the Limited Nuclear Test Ban of 1963      to SALT II of 1980.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>We have grasped the mystery of the atom and      rejected the Sermon on</strong></em> <strong><em>the      Mount</em> .... <em>Ours is a world of nuclear giants and      ethical infants. We</em> <em>know more about war</em> than      we know about <em>peace, more about killing than we do      about living.</em></strong><br />      <br />      <strong>- General Omar Bradley</strong><br />      <br />      <strong>WALTER MONDALE</strong><br />      <br />      Here is Walter Mondale's complete reply to the question "If      elected president, what specifically will you do to prevent      nuclear war?" <em>I believe that there is no higher      priority than the prevention</em> <em>of</em> <em>nuclear      war.<br />      <br />      That is why I support a bilateral verifiable nuclear      freeze, leading to major reductions in nuclear arsenals on      both sides. That is also why 1 intend to challenge the      Soviets to accept temporary, mutual, and verifiable      moratoria such as on underground nuclear testing and      testing and deployment of space weapons.</em><br />      <br />      <em>As 1 have said before, the risk of war cannot be      eliminated overnight. But every day it can be either      increased or decreased. And one</em> <em>of</em> <em>the      surest ways to increase it is to cut</em> <em>off</em>      <em>communications.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Unfortunately, after almost four years in</em>      <em>of</em> <em>fice, President Reagan has made no progress      in dialogue with our adversaries. He has gotten no results,      and he has opposed the results</em> <em>of</em>      <em>negotiations by past Presidents. When 1 am elected I      will make negotiation a priority from the first day</em>      <em>of</em> <em>my administration, not an eleventh hour      event at the end of my term. I will seek annual summit      conferences with the Soviet Union. Serious progress toward      reducing the danger</em> <em>of</em> <em>war requires more      intense and consistent efforts at firm but genuine      negotiation.</em><br />      <br />      <em>The great challenge to us as a nation is to reduce the      danger</em> <em>of</em> <em>war without raising a risk to      our security. We require a strong defense, but one in which      we increase our reliance on conventional forces rather then      nuclear firepower. We also need to reform procurement      practices, to avoid waste and unnecessary duplication. My      administration will put primary emphasis on improving      conventional forces and their preparedness, and on      efficiency in management.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Other measures 1 would pursue include reaffirming our      commitment to the ABM treaty, renewed efforts against      proliferation</em> <em>of</em> <em>nuclear weapons, and the      establishment</em> <em>of</em> <em>U.S.-Soviet nuclear risk      reduction centers and other improved      communications.</em><br />      <br />      <em>1 have long experience in dealing with the problems of      nuclear arms control, and a heartfelt appreciation of the      magnitude of the task. As a Senator I consistently      supported arms control initiatives, and as Vice President I      was heavily involved in the</em> <em>development of arms      control policy, particularly on the SALT II treaty, which      President Reagan has unfortunately rejected.</em><br />      <br />      Our national interest and <em>our survival require that we      find a safe and secure way to lower ten</em> <em>sions with      the Soviet Union. We must have no illusions about the      necessity to deter the Soviets from aggression, but we must      also find better ways to meet them on the common ground of      survival. With the help of the American people, 1 intend to      accomplish both tasks as President.</em><br />      <br />      And here are his major deeds in the area of arms      control:<br />      <br />      * As a senator in Washington from 1965 to 1976, he      consistently voted for arms control measures. Specifically,      he voted for SALT I (which contained the Anti-Ballistic      Missile Treaty), and against development of the Trident      submarine, the B-1 bomber, MIRVed (Multiple      Independently-Targetable Reentry Vehicles) missiles,      Minuteman II, and a counterforce capability.<br />      <br />      * As vice president under Carter, Mondale worked hard to      secure congressional endorsement of the SALT II treaty,      which the Soviets ratified but our country did not.<br />      <br />      <strong>CONGRESS</strong><br />      <br />      Unfortunately, we don't have room to list the voting      records of all 535 congressional incumbents on arms control      issues. But you can write SANE, 711 G St. S.E., Washington,      DC 20003, and request a copy of "The SANE Voting Record,      1983," which lists each congressperson's record and rating.      Or call SANE (202/546-7100) and ask for your incumbents'      ratings <em>on</em> arms control.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE BEGINNING</strong><br />      <br />      Enough. Let us all act to help save ourselves. And      remember, if you as an individual have chosen to make      personal preparations for possible postwar survival, please      <em>also</em> dedicate yourself to <em>preventing</em>      nuclear war in the first place.<br />      <br />      Let us work to make Jesus' words "Peace be with you" true      for everyone . . . today and tomorrow    </p>
