                        <h2 id="subtitle">      Part IX: Scale Insects    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by Ron Westby    </h5>    <p>      In predator-prey relationships, one axiom stands before all      others: What can't be seen (that is, <em>recognized)      generally</em> won't be eaten! And insects seem to have all      but cornered the market on effective disguises. Moths blend      in with tree bark . . . katydids resemble leaves ... and      inchworms mimic twigs (when alarmed).    </p>    <p>      However, the slyest members of the      whatyou-see-may-not-be-what-you-get set are definitely the      scale insects. These crusted con artists look more like      bird droppings or disease organisms than bugs . . . and are      often ignored, even by gardeners. That's too bad, because      scales are related to aphids and can become just as      abundant . . . often literally encrusting the stems of      trees and shrubs.    </p>    <p>      Young scales, called crawlers, are fairly mobile; but they      soon grow sessile under the protection of their tough outer      shell. These insects do their damage by sipping the sap      from a host plant (usually orchard trees and ornamentals),      a process that can cause a gradual decline in vigor of the      plant or tree, stunt its growth, and even kill it. And the      foliage-killers are so adept at hiding that they often      exist unnoticed till winter causes the leaves to drop from      their deciduous-tree hosts.    </p>    <p>      GROWING UP TOUGH    </p>    <p>      Of the 4,000 or so species of scale insects, few ever      exceed 3 cm (1.2") in length, and most range in size from a      barely discernible 1 mm to a tiny 1.5 cm. The most      prevalent types, in the U.S., are the soft scales (family      Coccidae) and the armored scales (family Diaspididae).      Despite the names, both of these develop hard shells, but      the soft scales grow theirs as an extension of their      exoskeleton, whereas the protective "bubbles" of the      armored group are not attached to the bugs' bodies.    </p>    <p>      In general, all scales have similar (and fairly simple)      life cycles. They go through an incomplete metamorphosis      (egg to nymph to adult). In the nymph stage, scale insects      are equipped with legs, but when they reach adulthood,      these appendages drop off, and the creatures become      sedentary. A female lives out her life beneath a protective      shell, sucking plant juice and laying eggs (about 1,000 a      year!) till there's little left of her. An adult male-with      a set of feeble wings able to propel him only a few feet at      a time, and with no digestive tract-exists only to      copulate, after which, in most cases, he will die.    </p>    <p>      <em>TOP: Hemispherical scales are</em> among <em>the</em>      most common of soft scale insects. <em>MIDDLE: Oystershell      scales</em> are oblong, armored scale in <em>sects. BOTTOM:      Two typical armored scales. The outer shell has been      removed from the one on the left to expose the legless      insect beneath.</em>    </p>    <p>      A FEW SPECIFICS    </p>    <p>      About the most notorious (and prolific!) scale insect in      the U.S. is the armored San Jose (Quadraspidiotus      perniciosus). This minuscule black or brown bug is      particular ly injurious to orchard trees and ornamentals,      and an army of them-if not controlled-can easily destroy an      entire tree. The San Jose's armored, oblong cousin, the      oystershell scale <em>(Lepidosaphes ulmi),</em> enjoys the      same diet and is equally lethal.    </p>    <p>      Citrus, avocados, ferns, and greenhouse plants are fair      game for the hemispherical scale <em>(Saissetia      hemisphaerica),</em> a brown, softshelled member of the      crusted clan. Black scales <em>(Saissetia oleae)</em> are      widely distributed soft scales and are destructive to      olives, citrus, pears, apples, grapes, and figs. All in      all, the North American species of the scale family are too      numerous to list, but they're so minute that, without a      microscope, you'd often be hard put to tell one "breed"      from another anyway.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ERADICATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Scales are difficult to get rid of, but in many instances      they can be kept in check by natural predators and      parasites. Ladybugs, such as the vedalia <em>(Rodolia</em>      cardinalis),which was imported into California from      Australia in 1860 to combat cottony-cushion scales (Icerya      purchasi ), and various chalcid wasps (Aphy <em>tis</em>      lingnanensis, A. melinus, and Prospaltella perniciosi) are      often loosed in scale-infested orchards and greenhouses.      And these insects have proved pretty effective at cleaning      up the crusty bug population.    </p>    <p>      Then again, if you've got the time, you could try      hand-crushing scales. But, if you do so, remember that      females lay their eggs underneath their shells . . . so      you've got to really put the pressure on in order to      destroy them!    </p>    <p>      As a last resort, oil sprays can be used against the pesky      insects. The so-called dormant sprays are oil solutions      that are applied to deciduous trees during their dormant      season. These are most effective when sprayed in early      spring after the young scales hatch and before buds on the      trees open. Lighterweight "summer oils" are generally used      on citrus and evergreens during their growing season.    </p>    <p>      One last thought. Although scales may seem to lead      relatively dreary existences, you've got to admit they're      pretty darn good at the two things they do best: living off      our food-bearing trees (and plants), and procreating! So      the next time you spot what appears to be a rash on your      prized citrus tree, better take a closer look to make sure      it's not a colony of those elusive masters of disguise . .      . the scale insects.    </p>
