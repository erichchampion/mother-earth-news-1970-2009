                <p>      If you're just about ready to give up your power bill,      maybe it's time to look into... Low Voltage Living    </p>            <p>      Do you sometimes feel as if you're at the mercy of your      mailbox and the monthly utility bill it contains? You're      not alone: Power company per-kilowatt-hour (kwh) rates are      pushing up over 15e in some parts of the country-enough to      suck better than $ 100 out of many people's monthly      budgets-and there's not the slightest reason to suppose      that we've seen more than the tip of this financial      iceberg. Maybe it's just about time to abandon ship!<br />      <br />      The alternative-a personal electrical system using a      renewable resource-can offer you an insurance policy      against the inexorable escalation of utility electricity      prices. Researchers such as Hunter and Amory Lovins (see      the Plowboy Interview in issue 88) have argued persuasively      that investments in conservation and renewable energy are      among the wisest that anyone can make. But there are other      equally convincing arguments for making the move toward      electrical independenceamong them, the personal      satisfaction that can be gained by taking control.<br />      <br />      The power grid that public-owned utilities and the      government have supplied us with is a marvel of      reliability. And the awesome size and complexity of that      system make it hard to recall just how simple an electrical      supply can actually be. But, in fact, a small,      well-conceived home power station need be no more complex      than an automobile's electrical system.<br />      <br />      In the following paragraphs, we're going to give you an      overview of what <em>we've</em> found to be the simplest,      least expensive method of achieving electrical      independence. We've been working with low-voltage,      direct-current power systems for a number of years now and      have found that they offer a practical combination of low      initial cost, expandability, flexibility, simplicity, and      reliability. For people on a limited budget who are willing      to conserve, low-voltage living is assuredly the most      sensible way to cut the utility umbilical.<br />      <br />      <strong>WHAT IS LOW-VOLTAGE LIVING?</strong><br />      <br />      For our purposes, low-voltage means producing 12-volt      direct current (VDC) and using it at that level whenever      possible. For technical reasons, low-voltage electricity      limits the size of a given appliance and the total amount      of power that will be available in a day. Therefore, to      keep the system simple, we've more or less arbitrarily      decided that the largest 12-volt appliance we'll use will      draw 150 watts and that the maximum amount of power that      will be <em>produced</em> in a day is 3,000 watt-hours . .      . or 3 kilowatt-hours (kwh). As you'll soon see, there are      ways around both of these restrictions, but a low-voltage      house hold will still end up being one that uses far less      electricity than the norm of about 900 kwh per month.<br />      <br />      Much of the margin between 900 kwh per month and 90 can be      made up simply by not using electricity to power major      heating appliances (a water heater, stove, or space heater,      for instance). Solar energy is a good choice for water      heating . . . gas or wood can be used for cooking . . . and      passive solar heatingbacked up with a little wood in the      stoveshould keep you comfy.. Those three changes alone will      trim at least 500 kwh/month from the U.S. average. But      before we get too deeply into how to <em>use</em>      electricity in a lowvoltage house, we'd better figure out      where that power will come from in the first place.<br />      <br />      <strong>TAPPING NATURE'S</strong> <strong>POWER      SYSTEM</strong><br />      <br />      To a great extent, the alternative power source you choose      will be determined by the resource you have available. As      attractive as hydropower is in comparison with wind or      solar, it requires that you have flowing water that goes      downhill some distance. For those of you who have the      luxury of choosing, the following chart sums up the      relative advantages of each system, and should give you a      basic idea of what natural and financial resources are      required.<br />      <br />      <em>To withstand high-amperage 12-volt DC power, switches      should be equipped with 47microfarad capacitors wired in      parallel to tame arcing between the contacts. Use only snap      (as opposed to silent) switches for DC power.</em><br />      <br />      The success of your project will hinge on correctly      estimating your renewable resource. With hydropower, you      must accurately measure the fall and flow, and the volume      of water must be figured at the hourly <em>minimum</em> to      prevent installing equipment that will demand more water      than is available. Average annual wind speed will determine      the <em>size</em> of wind machine you need to buy. If your      site has a 10-mph average, you'll need a 2,000watt plant,      but at 15 mph you can get by with only 1,000 watts      capacity. The number of photovoltaic (PV) panels you might      need will also be profoundly affected by the area in which      you live. In New Mexico, for example, 20 panels will      provide 3,000 watt-hours per day, but 30 would be needed to      do the job in overcast areas in upstate New York.<br />      <br />      <strong>STORAGE</strong><br />      <br />      The weakest link in any low-voltage electrical system is      almost always its batteries. Why? Well, usually because      they're the wrong type for the application, they're      improperly sized, they're poorly monitored, or they don't      receive adequate maintenance. This information was covered      thoroughly in TJ Byers' article in MOTHER NO. 74, page 114,      but we're going to review a few of the key points      again.<br />      <br />      First of all, you must choose the right type of battery for      your generating method. There are essentially three types:      lead-calcium, leadantimony, and pure lead. Lead-calcium      cells should be cycled through only about the upper      30°70 of their total capacity, which makes them      suitable only for consistent power sources, such as hydro.      Their advantage is that they're quite efficient.      Lead-antimony batteries can be deeply discharged without      rapidly degrading but aren't quite as durable as pure lead      cells. Unfortunately, the latter are more expensive. Both      of the last two lose some power just standing around      waiting. In any event, you must not use auto batteries . .      . heavy-duty, deep-cycle cells are mandatory for      reliability.<br />      <br />      What's more, a battery bank that's too small or too large      for the generator output and your use will have its life      span cut severely. Batteries are designed to be discharged      and recharged at certain rates, and using or replacing too      much too quickly will damage them. Likewise, a huge battery      bank that's underutilized and receives only a tiny charge      will deteriorate.<br />      <br />      Monitoring and maintenance consist of checking the specific      gravity of each celi once a week, keeping a daily eye on      the system's voltage (which is an indicator of charge),      cleaning the terminals whenever they become corroded,      maintaining the fluid level, and providing a shelter where      the temperature will stay between about 40 and      90°F.<br />      <br />      The battery bank should be centrally located, to avoid long      runs of expensive cable, and must be well-ventilated to      prevent toxic and explosive gases from accumulating. If you      have a remote point where you need powersuch as a      well-consider locating a <em>slave</em> battery (or      batteries) at that location. The amperage demands from a      well pump are much greater than the peak charging current,      so placing the battery at the point of use will allow the      heavy current to be transmitted a short distance. The      modest charging current can make the long haul from the      generator or centrally located bank.<br />      <br />			</p>			    <p>      <strong>WIRING</strong><br />      <br />      As we've already suggested, there are certain technical      limits to the size of appliances or generators in a      low-voltage electrical system. Because wattage is a      function of both voltage and amperage, when one goes down      the other must rise. Unfortunately, amperage determines the      carrying capacity of wire. Therefore, proper wiring and      switching are particularly important in a low-voltage      electrical setup. In general, No. 10 copper wire will serve      any load of less than 150 watts in a normal-size home.      There will, however, have to be some appliances that draw      more than 150 watts.<br />      <br />      To give you an example of what this can mean, let's suppose      that you have an appliance that needs 480 watts to run-a      vacuum cleaner, for example. At a normal utility household      voltage of 120, you could use a 740-foot extension cord of      No. 10 wire if you wanted to; but at 12 volts, you would be      limited to 7.4 feet of wire from the battery to the vacuum.      If you used a No. 8 wire, you could stretch out 12 feet      into the room; No. 6 would give you a range of 18 feet; and      No. 2 (which is heavy and costs upwards of $1.00 per foot)      would let you swing around for 46 feet.<br />      <br />      Obviously, all of these situations are pretty much      intolerable. The solution is to run large appliances on      110-volt alternating current (VAC). One way to get 110 VAC      at a remote site is to use a motor-driven generator. If      used infrequently, one of these fossil-fuel burners can be      really handy to have around. A more sophisticated      alternative, however, is to use a solid-state inverter of      about 1,000 watts capacity. This device transforms 12 volts      to 120, for efficient transmission, and makes alternating      current---the sort of power that utilities supply. An      inverter will allow you to use appliances that run on      normal household current and may be the ideal solu tion for      operating large devices such as vacuum cleaners or for      supplying appliances that require alternating current. You      can refer to TJ Byers' two-part article on inverters in      MOTHER NOS. 80 and 81 for the lowdown on such      devices.<br />      <br />      Just as independent power systems require special wiring,      they also need switches that are up to the task of handling      heavy direct currents. There are devices designed      especially for this sort of use, but it's possible to get      by with a standard snap (not silent) switch equipped with a      50-volt, 47-microfarad capacitor in parallel, to tame      arcing. An accompanying photo shows you how this is done.      Normal outlets are capable of handling DC loads, but it's a      good idea to use a style different from normal 120-VAC      receptacles, so that no one can plug a 120-VAC device into      your 12- VDC system. Some people prefer automotive      cigarette lighter-type receptacles, while others use      outlets designed for 220 VAC.<br />      <br />      You'll also need a control panel, which you can either buy      or fabricate yourself. We've built several of these at      Eco-Village-they're shown in the photos-and they're really      not difficult to put together. At the minimum, a control      panel will need an ammeter to show the rate at which you're      using electricity, a voltmeter to indicate battery voltage,      and fuses to protect against shorts. Circuit breakers can      be used instead of fuses, but they must be designed for 12      FDIC.<br />      <br />      Unless your system sizing turns out to be so accurate that      power production exactly matches what you use, you'll also      need a battery charge controller. These devices reduce      charging current as the batteries become "full," and there      are essentially three types. The <em>reduction</em>      controller reduces the current going to the battery bank as      its voltage rises, wasting the excess. The      <em>diversion</em> controller shunts excess current (that      which the batteries don't need) to a resistance heating      load, such as a water heater. The <em>balance of      systems</em> controller, a relatively new development,      allows a wind or PV generator to produce at maximum useful      voltage (and thereby also at maximum amperage) and then      reduces that level to whatever the batteries happen to      need.    </p>          <p>      <strong>APPLIANCES</strong><br />      <br />      Just about any appliance that you can imagine having is      available for 12-volt living. You'll discover quickly that      these items are somewhat more expensive than their 120V AC      counterparts, but they're generally quite well made.      Low-voltage items should last for decades with an      occasional replacement of brushes in their motors.      Furthermore, 12<br />      <br />      <em>These are a few of the many options for 12volt      direct-current lighting. The large devices are fluorescent      bulbs in various shapes, and the two small bulbs are      incandescent lamps from recreational vehicles.</em><br />      <br />      VDC brushless motors are gradually becoming available,      which should make the lowvoltage appliances virtually      maintenance-free. The chart below shows you an example of      what can be done on 3,000 watts per day.<br />      <br />      Modern 12-volt refrigerators are true marvels. They can do      with 500 watts what your run-ofthe-mill home icebox takes      3,000 watts to get done. But, as you'll discover when      thumbing through catalogs, this incredible efficiency      doesn't come cheap. The ArcticKold, Marvel, and Sun Frost      refrigeratorfreezers all retail for between $1,500 and      $3,000. For the low-voltage home, however, the only      commercial alternative to these units is to find an      absorption-cycle icebox that runs on a fossil fuel. The      Sibir, which is sold by Lehmann Hardware, appears to be a      fine unit. There are also used refrigerators around that      run on propane or even kerosene.<br />      <br />      The only 12-volt washing machines we've come across are      conversions of standard machines from companies such as      Real Goods Trading Company or Windlight Workshop. This      isn't as difficult as it sounds: Just about any wringer      washer can be converted easily, and conversion kits are      available that help you to alter many popular modern      machines. David Copperfield's book, <em>Convert Automatic      Washers to 12 Volts,</em> is also helpful.<br />      <br />      Television and home entertainment systems are no problem at      all. Quality 12-volt color and black-and-white televisions      are readily available from recreational vehicle suppliers,      and automotive stereo systems can rival the fidelity of the      best 120-VAC equipment.<br />      <br />      And, yes, you can even pump your domestic water with      12-volt electricity. Many of the companies listed in the      accompanying sidebar offer shallow-well and submersible      pumps, and there are even a few deep-well pumps available.      Of course, the actual amount of power that will be consumed      by the pump will depend on the flow and head pressure you      demand from it. So 800-watthours-per-day is just an      estimate.<br />      <br />      There are a number of very good lowvoltage lighting      options. Fluorescent is the preferred choice, because it's      so much more efficient than incandescent lighting. Our own      informal testing showed that a 13-watt Norelco fluorescent      was able to put out as much light as a 60-watt normal      household bulb. And 120VAC fluorescent units can be      converted to 12 VDC by switching ballasts. Replacement      lowvoltage ballasts are available from most of the      companies mentioned in our sidebar.<br />      <br />      What else would you like to have in your low-voltage,      energy-efficient household? A blender, perhaps? A toaster?      A hair dryer or an electric curling iron? All of these      things are available in 12-volt versions. There's really      very little that you will be forced to give up when living      independent from the power grid.<br />      <br />      The question really isn't whether low-voltage living is      possible, practical, or even pleasant. It's whether you      <em>want</em> to take a hand in the production of the      energy that you use while living on this planet. You'll      work a little harder for your electricity than you do      now-checking batteries, cleaning PV panels, devising new      ways to use 12-volts, etc.-but you won't dread the trip to      the mailbox nearly as much.    </p>        <p>      For the most part, this sidebar lists companies that sell a      broad range of alternative energy equipment,      or specific individuals who offer goods or services that      are unavailable elsewhere.    </p>
