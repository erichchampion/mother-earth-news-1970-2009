                   <p>      <strong>IF YOU NEED TECHNICAL OR BUSINESS-RELATED      INFORMATION ON RENEWABLE ENERGY, YOU CAN GET HELP      FREE</strong> from the National Appropriate Technology      Assistance Service (NATAS), sponsored by the Department of      Energy (DOE). NATAS offers a toll-free hotline      (800/428-1718 for Montana residents; 800/428-2525 for      residents of all other states) specifically designed to      provide technical support for individuals or groups      involved in developing, using, or marketing alternative      energy technologies or products. Homeowners and others      needing more general information are urged to phone DOE's      Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral      Service (CAREIRS): 800/233-3071 (for Alaska and Hawaii      residents), 800/462-4983 (for Pennsylvania residents), and      800/523-2929 (for residents of all other states).<br />      <br />      <strong>A SOLAR POWER CONVERTER THAT MAY CUT THE COST OF      SUNLIGHT-SPAWNED HOME ELECTRICITY BY AS MUCH AS      90%</strong> has been patented by Alvin M. Marks. The      device, called the Lepcon, uses submicron antennas on a      glass plate to convert sunlight into high-frequency      alternating current, which is then changed by a miniature      circuit to direct current. The inventor estimates the cost      of electricity from the Lepcon at about 500 per watt, as      compared to the $5.00 per watt typical of conventional      silicon-crystal photovoltaic equipment. Mr. Marks also      claims a 75% efficiency rate for his invention (versus a      theoretical 20%, and a thus-far-achieved 8% to 10% rate,      for standard solar cells). If mass-produced, a      100-square-foot Lepcon roof panel would cost about $1,500      and generate sufficient power for a small household. A      photovoltaic array producing the same output would cost      approximately $75,000. (The catch, of course, is that the      Lepcon is not yet commercially available, and may not be      for quite some time.)<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>HOW DO YOU TELL PEOPLE TO      "KEEP OUT" FOR 100 CENTURIES?</strong> Scientists calculate      that 10,000 years will have to elapse before the      radioactive waste created in the past 30 years by the      nuclear power industry will become "safe." In addition to      the as-yet-unresolved problems of how and where to store      the stuff, there's the question of how to warn hundreds of      future generations about the material's hazards and      locations. The Department of Energy recently commissioned      proposals from scientists in several disciplines, and      received a variety of interesting ideas. Thomas Sebeok, a      linguistics expert at Indiana University, suggested      establishing an "atomic priesthood" that would create and      perpetuate myths and taboos about the sites to scare people      away. Most of the reports, however, focused on effective      communications techniques and suitably enduring markers.      Perhaps the most practical was submitted by archaeologist      Maureen Kaplan, who, after studying such lasting monuments      as the Pyramids and the Acropolis, suggested building      Stonehenge-like rings of rock monoliths around the "hot"      dumps. The pillars would then be inscribed with      pictographic and multilingual warnings discouraging deep      drilling and mining.<br />      <br />      <strong>HIGH-TECH MEETS LOW-TECH: COMPUTERIZED WOOD      STOVES</strong> may begin appearing on the market in 1985,      according to a report in the trade publication Wood 'n      Energy. Several manufacturers are currently working on      equipment that employs a microprocessor to monitor heat      intensity inside a firebox and open or close the draft to      achieve a preset room temperature level. In addition to      eliminating many of the manual tasks involved in tending a      fire, the computerized units could help conserve fuel by      burning only as much wood as necessary to keep a home      comfortable.<br />      <br />      <strong>ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPANIES SPENT 40% MORE ON TV      ADVERTISING</strong> last year than in 1982, says the      Television Bureau of Advertising. Commercials sponsored by      the U.S. Committee for Energy Awareness, an industry public      relations group (see "Energy Flashes," MOTHER N0. 82),      accounted for nearly two-thirds of the escalation. The      number of ads promoting electric heat pumps and electricity      itself increased, while ads encouraging conservation      decreased.<br />      <br />      <strong>LAND-POOR, GADGET-RICH JAPAN MAY</strong>      <strong>BE POISONING ITSELF WITH TINY BATTERIES</strong> .      Forty percent of Japan's mercury output goes into making      the small cylindrical or button-shaped dry cells that power      cameras, watches, calculators, and other electronic gizmos.      Eventually, of course, those batteries end up in garbage      dumps, where they leak mercury into the soil. The problem      is compounded by the fact that land is precious in Japan,      so waste-disposal sites that are deemed full are often      converted to other uses, such as school yards. Electronics      shops are now being supplied with collection boxes where      customers can return batteries for recycling.      (Incidentally, some 30 to 40% of Japan's battery      production, which totaled 2.85 billion units in 1983, is      exported to the United States and other countries.)<br />      <br />      <strong>OVER 2,000 INEXPENSIVE, LIGHTWEIGHT "TROPICAL      WINDMILLS"</strong> are now pumping water in rural      Colombian villages. The 180-pound units, designed with      Vnited Nations backing, can be transported by      four-wheeldrive to remote locations and installed by ranch      hands using only simple tools and an illustrated manual      .... THE WORLD'S LARGEST SOLAR POND is at Fort Benning,      Georgia, where a system involving eighty 200-foot-long      water-filled black plastic modules and 3.6 miles of pipe      supplies 6,500 troops with 500,000 gallons of hot water      daily .... WIND ENERGY WILL SUPPLY 10% OF ISRAEL'S      ELECTRICITY by the mid-1990's, according to government      energy experts .... THE WORLD'S FIRST WATER COLUMN POWER      PLANT will open in Norway in 1985. Expected to generate up      to one million kilowatthours per year, the facility, built      into bedrock, will utilize atmospheric pressure created by      wave impact to drive a turbine. *<br />    </p>
