                <p>      <em>If you thought that building furniture was for      experienced woodworkers only, think again.</em>    </p>       <h5 id="byline">      by Mark Jordan    </h5>    <p>      Most woodworkers consider a chair to be the most difcult      piece of everyday furniture to make. The problem is that      these usually delicate seats are subjected daily to      enormous stresses (such as 200-pound people leaning back on      the rear legs), and the mortise and tenon joints      traditionally used to handle such loads aren't easy to      construct.<br />      <br />      Well, I've come up with an alternative design that even a      novice should be able to cobble together fairly quickly,      using nothing more than a hammer, a saw, some nails, and      some glue. It incorporates simpler joinerylap joints-and      the structural strength of a truss framework to make a      truly durable chair: My dining set has withstood five years      of abuse from adults and children alike. As for aesthetics      . . . well, you decide. I think the design looks great,      particularly when you consider the price: zero, in my case      (because I used salvaged wood) . . . or anywhere from about      $2.50 per chair (for medium-quality spruce) to around $8.00      (for clear-grade hardwood) if you buy your own      lumber.<br />      <br />      Here's how to build a "truss-worthy" chair.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE JIG</strong><br />      <br />      First, you'll need to make a jig: a guide that helps you      position the components accurately, and also assures that      all of your chairs will be identical in design. To build      one, just round up some scrap plywood and a few pieces of 1      X 2 lumber. Now, keeping an eye on Fig. 1, proceed as      follows:<br />      <br />      Use an approximately 24"-square piece of plywood-any      thickness will do-for the jig's base (part Q in the      diagram). Nail a 20" 1 X 2 (part R) flush with, and      centered along, one edge of the base . . . that'll be the      jig's bottom edge. Then cut a piece of 3/4" plywood to form      a trapezoid (part S) measuring 9-1/4" at its top, 15-1/4"      at its bottom, and 14-1/4" on each side. The sides should      each form a 78° angle to the base of the jig's bottom      edge <em>(make sure that both angles are      identical).</em><br />      <br />      Now nail the trapezoid in place so that its bottom is flush      with, and centered along, part R. Nail a 12" 1 X 2 (part T)      parallel to, and 4-1/2" above, the trapezoid's base. Then      affix a 9" 1 X 2 (part U) across, and flush with, the top      of the trapezoid.<br />      <br />      Finally, cut a triangle of 3/4" plywood (part V) to measure      7-1/2" at its base and 11" on each side. Then saw the top      off laterally, about 1-1/4" from the tip, so that the      resulting snub-nosed "triangle" can be nailed flush -upside      down-with cross members T and U as shown in Fig. 1. There .      . . your jig is complete.    </p>        <p>      THE CHAIR The chair itself is made entirely of 1 X 2's;      you'll need about 33 linear feet in all, cutat 90°-to      the lengths indicated (I've keyed the components to Fig.      2).<br />      A: Four 15-1/2" legs<br />      B: Two 18" bottom rails<br />      C: Two 16" top rails<br />      D: Two 30" back rails<br />      E: Two 12-5/8" front supports<br />      F: Ten 15" seat and back slats<br />      G: Two (one front, one back) 15" bottom braces<br />      <br />      Basically, the chair consists of two side frames (which you      make, one at a time, on the jig) connected by a seat, a      back, and two support rails.<br />      <br />      Begin by constructing the right side frame, using Fig. 2 as      a guide. Lay your jig flat on a worktable, and place a leg      piece (A) against each of the trapezoid's angling sides so      that the ends of each leg butt against the jig's bottom      board (R), as shown in Fig. 2. Now po sition the bottom      rail (B) lengthwise against the bottom edge of the jig's      crosspiece (T), and mark where the rail overlaps the legs      (each of its ends should extend equally from the outside      surface of a leg). Then set the rail aside for a moment,      squeeze enough glue (Elmer's or any polyvinyl resin      adhesive) onto the marked areas to cover them thoroughly,      and put the bottom rail back into place. Finally, while      holding one leg and the rail firmly in position with one      hand, drive two 1-1/4" brads into the joint. Now do the      same with the opposite leg.<br />      <br />      Next, position, glue, and nail the top rail (C) into place      as shown in Fig. 2, making sure that piece is pushed firmly      against the jig's top cross member (U). As you can see from      the illustration, the top rail's right end should extend 2"      in front of the right leg. (NOTE: When you build the left      side frame, position the top rail the other way around-with      the left end extending 2" outward.)<br />      <br />      Now you're ready to install the right side frame's final      two members. Place the long back support piece (D) flush      along the left side of the jig's triangle, positioning the      outside edge of D's bottom end flush with the bottom edge      of the lower rail (B). The top end of the back support      piece will then extend across, and well beyond, the joint      you just made at the left leg and top rail. Glue and nail      the component in place, using two 2" finishing nails at the      top joint and 1-1/4" brads at the bottom.    </p>    <p>      NOTE: WHEN<br />      MAKING THE LEFT<br />      SIDE UNIT, REVERSE<br />      THE POSITIONS OF<br />      PARTS D AND E, AND<br />      PLACE THE TOP<br />      RAIL (C) SO THAT<br />      IT EXTENDS 2" OUT<br />      FROM THE LEFT LEG<br />      (A) ... THE<br />      OPPOSITE OF THE<br />      PLACEMENT SHOWN<br />      HERE.    </p>            <p>      With that done, position a front support piece (E) along      the right side of your jig's triangle, with the outside      edge of the component's bottom end flush with B, and the      <em>inside</em> edge of its top end flush with the top      rail's upper edge. Now glue and nail the front support in      place, again using a pair of 2" finishing nails at the top      and two 1-1/4" brads at the bottom. (Remember to      <em>reverse</em> the two supports when building the left      side frame. Place the front support to the left of the      triangle, and the back support to the right.)<br />      <br />      Remove the completed side frame, put it on a solid work      surface, and center-punch all the nails to draw each joint      up tightly and to sink all the spikes below the wood's      surface. Now <em>set the frame aside for at least 24 hours      to allow the glue to dry.</em> Don't skip this required      step! If you do, you'll loosen each glue joint when you      hammer the seat and back slats in place, and your chair      won't last more than a week.<br />      <br />      Naturally, once you've assembled the right side frame and      stashed it away to dry, you'll be ready to whip together      the left unit. Believe me, I don't use the words <em>whip      together</em> lightly; I can complete a side in just a few      minutes, and now that you've had some practice, you should      be able to, too.<br />      <br />      <strong>A DAY PASSES . . .</strong><br />      <br />      You're champing at the bit to get your chair finished,      right? Well, nothing could be easier. Just position the      seat slats 1/2" apart across the side frames. Mark where      the slats overlap the top rails (each end should extend      outward by 3/4 of an inch), apply glue to the marked areas,      and hammer the slats in place, using a pair of 2" finishing      nails at every joint.<br />      <br />      You'll need to exercise some patience when you attempt to      attach the first few slats, because you'll have a hard time      keeping the side frames upright and aligned while you hold      the slat in place. Even if you can't get someone to help      you steady the components, though, you'll be home free as      soon as the first couple of slats are nailed down and the      chair gains some rigidity. Make a point, however, to check      each slat with a try square to make sure it's perpendicular      to the frames.<br />      <br />      When you've finished the seat slats, go ahead and tack on      the back crosspieces. Position the first one so that its      bottom edge is 5" above the seat, and space the remaining      three pieces 1/2" apart, with the ends extending 1-1/2"      beyond the supports.<br />      <br />      Now, before you flop your carcass onto your newly built      handiwork, nail the front and back bottom braces (parts G)      in position, as shown in Fig. 2. Place each one so that its      bottom edge is pretty much even with the top edge of the      bottom rails (B). Give the whole thing another 24 hours to      dry, and <em>then you</em> and your chair will be ready to      meet seat to seat.<br />      <br />      I didn't apply any finish at all to my rustic set of four      yellow-poplar dining chairs, because the lumber came from      the floor of a 100-year-old house, complete with gouges and      nail holes, and I liked the look. The functional simplicity      of the furniture seems to call for a natural treatment, so      I just sanded the quartet slightly and left them "as is."      <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: Our staffers chose to use a mediumdark      wood stain, thinned with a bit of boiled linseed oil, to      color the truss-worthy chair they built of 1 X 2      pine.)</em><br />      <br />      My wife and I liked our quick-and-easy chairs so much that      we decided to make living room furniture in the same      pattern. The walnut rocker you see in the small photo is an      example; we made only a few modifications to the original      design, and I suspect that even further variations on the      theme (making a larger chair on a larger jig, for instance)      are possible . . . and waiting to be discovered by an      imaginative woodworker. Could that be you?    </p>
