        <p><strong>BITS & PIECES</strong></p><p><strong>Sick of trudging through the snow only to find an empty mailbox? There's good news.</strong></p><h3>In Search of Eden</h3><p>Adam and Eve found lovers' paradise in a garden - that is, until the unfortunate apple incident. Let's face it, gardens are inherently seductive with their sweet-smelling soil, ripe fruits, and the soothing crooning of nearby songbirds. Unfortunately, unlike Adam and Eve, most people don't have much luck finding mates in their backyard flower beds.</p><p>Until now. Gracia Roemer and Faith Wong of Utah have come up with a matchmaking system that brings together singles who share a love of gardening. It's called Single Soilmates. The two came up with the idea last Valentine's Day, sent out some press releases, and waited anxiously for feedback. Before they knew it, dozens of letters came pouring in. So they set up shop under a giant maple tree, where the two continue to read and sort through a sea of personal biographies sent in from potential Soilmates.</p><p>According to Gracia, Soilmates live all over the country - not to mention New Zealand and Canada - and they range in age from 19 to 73. Currently there are 250 members - some looking for romance, others simply seeking pen pals to ease winter loneliness.</p><p>An introductory six-month membership costs $4, a portion of which Gracia and Faith donate to programs that promote people-plant interactions. Many contributions, for example, are sent to suburban gardening and horticultural therapy programs in prisons, hospitals, and schools. Each Soilmate receives "The Secret Garden" - a listing of coded, self-descriptive bios of each member. Most singles share personal gardening information in addition to the more conventional statistics that singles usually supply in the personal ads. You might find someone who "subscribes to the organic philosophy," or "collects sundials," or even "lives for fresh cantaloupe."</p><p>Once members find an intriguing Soilmate, they enclose a letter to that person in an envelope with the recipient's assigned code number as well as their own printed on front. Soilmates will forward letters for $1 each. Members are welcome to include their address and/or phone number in their letters any time they wish. Some even send videos to each other (filmed in or out of the garden). For more information, write: Soilmates, P.O. Box 4065, Ogden, UT 84402.</p><h3>Setting a Faster Pace</h3><p>As we all seek out clean, renewable forms of energy, a new wind-power development is blowing standard turbines away. U.S. Wind Power, a subsidiary of the Kenetech Corporation out of San Francisco, California, has created a variable-speed wind turbine, making wind power more energy efficient than ever. It's official title: the 33M-VS Utility-Grade Wind Turbine.</p><p>Invented in California, the turbine measures 33 meters from blade to blade and blows from 1,800 to 2,200 rpm. Usually, when standard turbines face low winds, they slow down considerably, producing very little energy. But thanks to a new power-electronic converter called the "black box," the 33M generators and rotors can adjust to high and low winds, while the box maintains a constant current of 60 cycles.</p><p>The new wind turbines are equipped to utilize wind that blows as slow as 8 mph and as fast as 65 mph. They also provide 4 times the amount of energy of standard turbines - at only 2 1/2 times the cost of traditional turbines. This means that utility plants using 33M can provide enough energy to supply a city the size of San Francisco or Washington, D.C., at only five  cents per kilowatt.</p><p>The best and worst part of wind energy is its complete reliance on Mother Nature. While wind isn't dependable enough to be counted on as the sole means of energy, wind power <em>does</em> allow utility plants to comply with the emission allowances of the Clean Air Act. Utility plants using 33M turbines reduce the amount of pollutants released to the atmosphere, including sulfur dioxide, a by-product of burning coal that contributes to acid rain and increases global warming.</p><p>Currently the new turbines, owned by individual wind-power companies and utility power plants, are being used in the Northeast, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, Canada, Central America, New Zealand, and Europe. With its high efficiency and lower costs, wind energy technology may one day help to eliminate the nation's reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuels.

Colleen Murphy of Easton, Connecticut, has created Mail Alert, a new mailbox device that sends a electronic signal to your home once your mail arrives.</p><p>Murphy, 32, works with mentally retarded adults and enjoys building inventions in her spare time. Her inspiration for this one: frustration over trudging long distances to her mailbox only to find nothing in it. She also thought it would be perfect for her grandfather, who tended to sit and wait for the mail all day.</p><p>Like the U.S. mail service, the signal works regardless of rain, sleet, or snow because all the equipment sits indoors. A 2 1/2" x 3 1/2" plastic transmitter attaches to the inside of your mailbox with a Velcro-like fastener. Connected to the transmitter is a 1 1/2" lever that is released as soon as the mailbox is opened. A signal is then sent to a receiver located in the house. The 3" x 5" receiver, which looks like a baby monitor and consists of a small light, an antenna, and a reset button, simply plugs into the wall.</p><p>When a signal is received, an alarm sounds for five seconds and a light lights up until the reset button is hit. There is also a reset button on the transmitter in the mailbox, in case you check your mail too early on the way home. The transmitter operates along the same lines as a garage door opener; it is entirely wireless and operated by a nine-volt battery. Depending upon interference in the area, Mail Alert can send a signal up to a quarter of a mile away.</p><p>Murphy sees Mail Alert as good security against mail theft (you know as soon as your box is opened) and as a service tool for the elderly, the disabled, and people living in rural areas far from their mailboxes. Look for Mail Alert on the market (from Milmar Enterprises) within a year, selling for approximately $50. Now if Murphy would only create a device to electronically obliterate our bills ....</p><p>For more information write to: Colleen Murphy at Milmar Enterprises, 717 Stepney Road, Easton, CT 06612 or call 203/452-9685.</p><p><em>Editor's Note: Do you have any interesting, timely, or peculiar news items you would like to share?

But variable-speed turbines can use winds of almost any speed and are up to 40% more energy efficient.
