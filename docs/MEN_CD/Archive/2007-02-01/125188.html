        For a genuine escape from high gasoline prices, electric bikes andscooters provide fast, fun, gas-free transportation. Severaloptions are available now, with more coming soon. The market forelectric two-wheelers is promising, but it's also still young andvolatile ? buyers should focus on quality, experts say. Below we'lloffer four rules for choosing an e-ride.<br /><br />Pedelecs and E-Bikes<br />There are two types of electric-assist bicycles: pedelecs ande-bikes. On a pedelec, the rider must pedal to activate theelectric assist; on an e-bike, you simply turn a throttle. Federallaw limits electric-assist power to 750 watts; 500 watts in Canada.(Laws governing electric bikes and scooters vary by state regardinglicensing, insurance, titling, helmet use, lights, operator age,top speed and more. Check your state's regulations at .)<br />Experts seem to agree that consumers should expect to spend morethan $500 for an e-bike that can deliver the necessary performance,durability and reliability.<br /><br />Electric scooters<br />The term 'e-scooter' applies to a wide variety of machines. At oneextreme, they're electric versions of classic Vespa scooters (thinkAudrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday). Powered by 1,500- to 2,000-wattmotors, these machines are solid rivals for their 49cc gas-poweredcounterparts in performance and price but without the noise,tailpipe pollution and reliance on gasoline. At the other extreme,they're standup platform scooters ? beefed-up versions ofchildren's sidewalk scooters. They're intended for short trips;unlike bikes, they have no pedals. Many of the smaller models lackseats and fold up.<br /><br />Watts and Amps<br />The power of gas engines is measured in either cubic centimeters(cc) or horsepower, but electric motors are rated in watts ? andthe higher the wattage, the better. View wattage claims withskepticism, especially from less established manufacturers oronline retailers. Knock-off makers and sellers often overratemotors. A favorite trick is to list the motor's peak wattage as itscontinuous power rating, but since a motor can run at peak for onlya few seconds without damage, this is misleading.<br />The more powerful the motor, the better the performance, especiallyon hills. But power gains bring weight gains, and an e-bike oftenweighs two or three times as much as a conventional bicycle,especially if it uses inexpensive but heavy lead-acid batteries.More and more e-bikes are now using powerful and lightweight, butmore expensive, lithium-ion batteries.<br /><br />Batteries: Care and Charging<br />Batteries are the other critical element of any e-scooter ore-bike. A battery's capacity is measured in ampere-hours(amp-hours).For commutes of less than five miles on level terrain,a battery rated below 17 amp-hours will be sufficient. For moredemanding applications, make sure the machine has a battery ratedhigher than 17 amp-hours. And, as with motor wattage, the moreamp-hours, the better.<br />Those batteries also must be charged, and the quality of thecharger is important. To cut corners, clone scooter makers may shipan inexpensive but inefficient charger. If you notice the batteriesgetting warm during the charge ? and we're talking about lead-acidbatteries, which power most e-scooters today ? buy a bettercharger. Heat shortens the life of most batteries.<br />To get best performance, treat your batteries well. Lead-acidbatteries respond poorly to deep discharges or overcharging. Formaximum mileage, take only relatively short trips and recharge thebatteries frequently. For example, it's better to drive three10-mile trips, recharging in between, than one 30-mile jaunt.<br /><br />Four Rules for Choosing an E-Ride<br />All things considered, here's what our experts advise when shoppingfor an e-bike or e-scooter:<br />1) You get what you pay for.<br />2) Buy as many watts and amps as you can afford.<br />3) Go for quality, defined here as performance, reliability andworkmanship. It will cost more initially, but will pay in the longrun.<br />4) Select a manufacturer with a good track record that appearslikely to stand behind its product with parts and service over thelife of the machine.<br /><br />Resources:<br />Electric Bikes Worldwide Reports , co-authored by Ed Benjamin andFrank Jamerson<br />Electric Scooter World , a comprehensive site maintained by scooterexpert Jerome Byrd<br /><br />
