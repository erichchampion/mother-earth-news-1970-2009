                        <p>      If you're not familiar with beekeeping, here's some basic      information about the creatures (see also "Bee Talk",      MOTHER NO. 12, pg. 39).    </p>    <p>      <strong>SWARM</strong> : bees that have left the hive with      their queen to establish a new family (colony). Those left      behind raise a new queen. A prosperous colony may have up      to 75,000 or more members at the peak of summer activity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EGGS:</strong> The queen, who is the only fully      developed female in a hive, lays two kinds of eggs: fertile      and infertile. The nurse bees determine whether a fertile      egg will mature into a queen or a worker by the food they      give the developing larva. If the egg is to become a future      mother, a cell resembling a small peanut is built around it      as the larva grows. At the end of the larval period the      cell is sealed and the development of the pupa begins.      After 16 days the queen is fully grown and gnaws her way      out, sometimes assisted by the workers. Only one breeding      female is allowed to remain permanently in the colony.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WORKER:</strong> an undeveloped female, smaller      than the queen. As larvae, workers are fed less nutritious      food and hatch from smaller cells in 20 to 21 days. Their      function is just what the name implies: They gather nectar      which is converted into honey, pollen and water for feeding      the young and gums and resins which are used to varnish the      inside of the hive and seal every crevice. Workers build      the combs, care for the queen, feed the young, carry out      the dead, ventilate the hive, generate heat in winter and      guard against intruders . . . they even give their lives if      necessary to protect the colony. (A worker dies when it      uses its stinger which is barbed and not retractile like      the queen's . . . which is smooth and used only to kill a      rival female.) Finally, they just work themselves to death.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DRONE:</strong> a male bee, which hatches from an      infertile egg in 24 to 25 days and requires a slightly      larger cell than a worker. Drones do no work in the field      or hive and serve only to fertilize young queens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HIVE:</strong> Bees will move into any home from      the cavity in a hollow tree to a portion of a cavern.      Modern hives are so designed that the beekeeper may      manipulate the various parts to control the activities of      the insects and simplify the removal of honey.    </p>    <p>      More details on these and other matters relating to bees      may be found in the following books:    </p>    <p>      <em>The Hive</em> <em>and the Honey Bee</em> , edited by      Roy A.
