                    <p>      Ever wonder whether you could put the sun's energy to work      for you where you live? Well, a former neighbor of MOTHER's      asked himself that question . . . and to find the answer,      he built a solar water heater right here in northern Ohio.    </p>    <p>      Though Kenneth Whetzel describes his little machine as      "experimental", there's nothing tentative about the hot      water it produces. Ken likes his shower about 105°, and      there wasn't one day in all the time the test system was      running that he couldn't have washed comfortably in the      device's output (had he been equipped to do so). That's not      bad for 60° weather. It should be noted, however, that      since Ken didn't intend actually to use his heater's      product, the contents of the tank are routed back through      the collector . . . an arrangement that makes the model      operate more efficiently than a working system in which the      warmed liquid is frequently drained off.    </p>    <p>      The collector that produced these results is a 2' X 4'      piece of sheet metal with about 24 feet of half-inch copper      tubing soldered to it in a zigzag pattern. This whole      heat-absorbing area is contained inside a wooden frame      sealed over with clear plastic sheeting. The tubing that      carries hot water away from the enclosure is insulated with      a layer of half-inch foam rubber and leads to a raised      11-1/2 gallon reservoir. protected by a styrofoam jacket      one inch thick. (Whetzel built the contraption entirely of      scraps scavenged from his construction job, so it's hard to      say just how much it would cost you to fabricate a similar      unit.)    </p>        <p>      One feature of Ken's design that really cuts the device's      cost, and which should be pointed out, is the fact that it      needs no mechanism to force water through the collector and      into its storage tank. Why? Because of a basic fact of      thermodynamics: Water, like air, expands and becomes      lighter per cubic measure as its temperature increases.      Rather than use electricity to run a pump, Ken took      advantage of this principle and set up his creation so that      the warmer-and lighter-H20 rises through the      cooler layers and on up the pipe into the top of the tank,      where-as it cools-the liquid sinks down into      the collector again for reheating.    </p>    <p>      A very simple, streamlined experiment, isn't it? And best      of all, it works. The first day Ken set up his invention      (pointed 10° west of south and tilted 30° downward      from the horizontal) the water temperature at 7 a.m. was      60°. By the time the experimenter got home from work at      5 p.m., the contents of the tank had been heated to      128° . . . too hot to put your hand into.      And-because of some nearby trees-the sun's rays      hadn't even hit the collector until about 10 in the      morning.    </p>    <p>      Overnight, Ken's hypothetical bath cooled only to 96°,      and when the second day turned out warmer and sunnier than      the first (with a high near 70°), Whetzel knew he could      look forward to some really impressive readings. Sure      enough, by evening his system's water temperature had      climbed to 138°. . . nearly twice as hot as the      surrounding air! Thereafter the tank's 5 p.m. temperatures      ranged from a low of 108° (a cloudy day) to a high of      148° . . . and on top of that record, the inventor      thinks he might be able to pick up 30% in efficiency by the      use of reflectors.    </p>    <p>      Ken was convinced. The last we heard-when he and his      wife left for their five-acre homestead in Florida-he      intended to employ the results of his experiment to set up      two practical solar heating systems: one to warm the house      in winter and another for domestic hot water. He figured      that three 2' X 8' collectors mounted on the garage roof      would supply at least 72 gallons of bath or wash water      (1-1/2 gallons to the square foot) per day . . . and      probably a lot more, considering Florida's fabled weather.    </p>    <p>      Our ingenious neighbor also thought his winter heating      system might be used to cool the house in summer by      circulating cold water from a well, but when we last talked      to him he hadn't worked out all the details of that      modification. Let us know when you do, Ken!    </p>
