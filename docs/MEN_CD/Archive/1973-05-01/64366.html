                   <h5 id="byline">by PATRICIA C. SPIER	 </h5>        <p>      I noticed that in his letter in MOTHER NO. 16 (pg. 92)      Chuck Boothby raised the question of "intrusions" by      building inspectors, but didn't seem to realize why the      regulations he resents were put into effect originally.    </p>    <p>      Back during the early settlement of the East and the      western pioneer days, there were no-or very      few-building codes. One reason was that every man,      with rare exceptions, had a good grasp of all kinds of      building, drainage, etc. And, since there was no true      plumbing and no electricity, more specialized knowledge      wasn't necessary. Moreover-except in towns and      cities-homes were so far apart and population so      small that it didn't seem possible that we could ever      pollute our environment or endanger our fellow man.    </p>    <p>      However, as population density increased and as more      sophisticated forms of sanitation, lighting and heating      were invented and perfected, the "common" man lost touch      with the knowledge he needed to build his own home, and      many mistakes were made which began to create social      disturbances such as fires, bad water, building collapses,      etc. Then laws were made to insure against such      occurrences, and these have become our building codes.    </p>    <p>      Every state has some building regulations, which are      usually confined to sanitation, electrical and plumbing      requirements. Most towns, too, have codes, which must meet      and can exceed the state's enactments. However, some      communities have none at all.    </p>    <p>      To be sure that you're in the right when you build, contact      your town hall and find out what rules are in force.      Unfortunately, although many of the smaller municipalities      are lax about close adherence to the code, some are very      strict and failure to comply can mean tearing everything      down or paying a fine which may amount to $10,000 for      endangering the public.    </p>    <p>      These restrictions, which seem so unfair to some, are there      for everyone's protection. You may think it's ridiculous      not to be able to build your own dry well and septic tank      system on an isolated farm, but the overflow from such an      installation could endanger you and possibly feed into the      water supply for a faraway town. Most of the time this      might not pose much of a problem, but there are many      bacterial and viral disease organisms which can't be      filtered out by the soil and which could cause a massive      epidemic if they weren't watched closely.    </p>    <p>      Sure, these policies may be made by the politicians and by      the rich-although many of the rules have been      suggested by the poorer classes as safeguards to      themselves-but they're still meant for the good of      the public. I think, therefore, that Chuck's stand is a      little harsh. But (or should I say and) where these codes      are useless and/or ridiculous, you can take them before the      town meeting or an open session of the city council for      argument. Just make sure you have all your facts before you      do.    </p>    <p>      Clark Hall (pg. 94) made a good point when he suggested,      "it seems to me that potential back-to-the-landers should      work on a farm just to see if they can hack it." As a      born-and-bred farm girl-although I now live in the      city-I know just how much hard work rural life can      be. It means long hours, rough schedules and little freedom      . . . and many people who think they'll love living in the      peace and quiet of the country find the isolation hard to      bear.    </p>    <p>      If you aren't able to work on a farm for awhile, try      farming at home in the city. In some ways it's harder, as      you don't have the room or facilities to do as much, but it      will give you some idea of how difficult the work is and      how much time you'll have to spend doing it . . . and it'll      give you a chance to work your book knowledge !edge into a      practical approach. After all, what you learn from reading      is all fine and good, but . . . .    </p>    <p>      Ronald J. Ballard's suggestion for using styrofoam (pg. 96)      is great, and relates to an idea I've been fiddling with.      Because there are hundreds of round plastic bottles just      lying around doing nothing (they don't decompose well, and      you can make only so many plastic bottle dolls, birdhouses,      etc.), I've been trying to find a way to use these      containers-cut down to wall depth-as      receptacles for shredded styrofoam and other light foamy      plastics. These should be not only great insulation but      convenient, too, since the units could be made up a few at      a time and the inner walls of animal housing sealed in as      you have enough bottles to fill the insulating gap. Regular      styrofoam glue is expensive to use for this project, so      I've been experimenting and trying to find a good cheap      substitute.    </p>    <p>      If styrofoam isn't available, you can make "curls" out of      strips cut from plastic containers, and use them to form a      network of air passages inside the bottle. This method      might not be as good, but will still take care of a garbage      nuisance productively.    </p>    <p>      To Pat and John Thomas (pg. 100) I send the following      directions for planting an avocado seed. I had to work them      out myself because I couldn't find any book that had      instructions.    </p>    <p>      Remove your avocado pit from the fruit and peel off its      outer skin. If you can't get to this right away, put the      seed in a cup and cover it with water so the husk won't dry      out and be hard to strip. If the stone should get dry, soak      it overnight before you start to pare.    </p>    <p>      When the seed is peeled, locate a spot about one-third of      the way below the pointed top. In three or four      places-spaced more or less equally around the      sides-make holes with a sharp-tipped knife and insert      toothpicks. Place the seed in a small glass or cup so that      the toothpicks rest on the edge, and add water to cover the      pit halfway. Let the glass stand in either a light or a      dark place (I prefer light) until the avocado's roots form.      Change the water whenever it gets cloudy.    </p>    <p>      A seed may root in days or it may take months, so don't get      impatient. When the roots are from two to five inches long,      plant the seed in a container at least 12 inches in      diameter (15 is better). The pot should also be at least a      foot and preferably a foot and a half deep to allow growing      room for the heavy taproots. Leave the top of the pit above      ground for rapid growth . . . you can cover it later if you      wish, but I prefer not to because the exposed seed seems to      grow better and looks rather attractive to me.    </p>    <p>      Water the avocado well-it needs a lot of moisture in      a warm house and bright sun-and side dress      periodically with rotted manure, dried granulated cow dung      or humus. These warm-or-temperate-weather plants won't      survive hard winters, so Pat and John shouldn't put theirs      outside in the Wisconsin climate.    </p>
