    <p>
            		<p><strong>SEASONS</strong></p>                <p>      In past columns I've discussed robins and grackles and      spring peepers. But two other signs that spring is coming      are an increase in the songs of the tufted titmouse and the      appearance of tiny butterflies called spring azures.    </p>    <p>      Most people who have bird feeders and live in the eastern      half of the United States are familiar with the tufted      titmouse. This bird is small but distinctly larger than its      relative, the chickadee. Few other small birds have the      titmouse's tufted crest of feathers on the head. The      titmouse is mostly gray, but it has a white breast with      buff-colored flanks and a white face surrounding oversized      beads of black eyes. It is interesting that the titmouse      usually sits more upright than the chickadee, but you don't      need a subtle feature like that to tell the titmouse apart      from the littler, round-headed, black-bibbed chickadee.    </p>    <p>      Tufted titmice are the only kind of titmouse in the whole      eastern half of the United States (a few other kinds are      found in south Texas and parts of the Southwest). While the      tufted has spread farther north with the help of feeders      and has extended its range to southern Ontario, it has not      yet reached the north parts of the northernmost tier of      states.    </p>    <p>      The titmouse emits its notes all year long. But when the      February days are warm enough for me and the titmouses to      be out and about, the forest begins to echo with a      noticeable increase in the number of their calls. Few small      birds have a voice so amazingly loud. The most common      version of the call is said to sound like "Peter, Peter,      Peter," but there are variations-one of which (to my      mind) sounds like "GOOD bird, GOOD bird." Roger Tory      Peterson states that-although the calls are somewhat      similar to those of chickadees-the tufted titmouse's      are "more drawling, nasal, wheezy, and complaining." But,      as with the chickadees, the complaining of these admirable      little birds is likely to amuse you and bring you good      cheer-especially if it comes in February and makes      you hopeful that spring is coming with its full symphony of      birdsong.    </p>    <p>      Suppose, however, that March comes-March and maybe      even the official first day of spring-and the weather      is still cold. Where do you look for hope of real spring?      It may come fluttering past you in the form of a little      spot of color. The spring azure is a butterfly that looks      like the tiniest piece of blue sky brought down to Earth to      dance among the first grasses. It measures 0.4 by 1.1      inches and yet it's twice as big as a related species, the      Western Pygmy Blue (America's smallest butterfly). The      spring azure occurs in over 13 different variations and you      might very well get close enough to see the tiny details.      It is a member of the family of butterflies called blues.      They are complemented by copper-red, black-spotted little      butterflies called coppers (the American copper may be the      United States's most common butterfly).    </p>    <p>      You may have to wait a little later to see your first      copper of the year. The azure blue is often the first      butterfly of all, frequently seen by late March (at least      around 40° North latitude). And when you witness a      butterfly fluttering past you on a somewhat chilly March      day, you'll know that the real spring must truly be near. A      mobile patch of blue not much bigger than your fingertip      may change the grey mood that has been oppressing you for      months!    </p>    <h3>      Look for Fiery Mars    </h3>    <p>      Long before you see coppers dancing with blues in a field      or roadside, you can step outside at dusk this February and      see tiger-colored Mars rising in the fading blue sky in the      east-northeast.    </p>    <p>      After darkness has fully fallen there's no mistaking this      impressive planet. All evening long it rivals the brightest      point in the sky, the star Sirius. But whereas Sirius is      white with a hint of blue and twinkles. Mars burns      orange-yellow and shines steadily.    </p>    <p>      Mars is brightest and closest on February 11. It looks much      the same all month before it begins a rapid fade, as Earth      starts to leave it behind in March. In early February it is      still fairly near the bright star Regulus and "the Sickle"      of stars that forms the head and chest of Leo the Lion. But      by late March it is over in dim Cancer the Crab, not far      from me fuzzy naked-eye patch of glow that is the Beehive      Star Cluster.    </p>    <p>      Mars may look fire-colored but it will not keep you warm on      February nights. But what does the planet now look like in      telescopes? Don't get your hopes too high. If your      telescope is good, it will at least show you Mars as a      small but tantalizing ochre disk. If your telescope has a      lens or mirror of 6 inches or more and the atmosphere is      quite steady, you may even see a few dark, seemingly      greenish markings on the globe and perhaps the tiny white      dot of the rapidly dwindling north polar ice cap. But this      "close approach" of Mars is one of the least close      possible. In the year 2003, Mars will look almost twice as      big as now and dozens of surface features should be within      range of amateur telescopes.    </p>        <h3>      Chinook, the Snow Eater    </h3>    <p>      The northern hemisphere of Mars that is now tilted somewhat      toward us is experiencing late spring. Yet temperatures      there may not be getting above 0°F. If that makes you      cold all over again, consider how in certain parts of our      own planet-especially on the eastward slopes of the      Rocky Mountains from Alberta to Colorado-spring      warmth can come blasting in over the course of hours or      even minutes.    </p>    <p>      The phenomenally fast and great episodes of heating in late      winter within a few hundred miles east of the Rockies are      caused by the wind known as the chinook. The chinook is a      west or southwest wind heated by compression as it comes      down the mountain slopes and hits the cold, dense air which      has flooded down from Canada and the Arctic over the Great      Plains. The chinook is known as the "snow-eater" because      its hot, dry blast can evaporate a foot or more of snow in      just a few hours. It often occurs with a clear sky overhead      but an arch of cloud visible over the mountains.    </p>    <p>      Some of the most extreme cases of the chinook have occurred      not in late winter but in January. After the extreme      warming can come an even greater temperature drop. For      instance, in a 24-hour period on January 23-24, 1916, the      temperature in Browning, Montana, fell from 44°F to      -56°F: a 100 degree drop! But even more amazing was the      chinook warming in the Black Hills at Spearfish, South      Dakota, that began at 7:30 a.m. on January 22, 1943. In      this case, the temperature rose 49°F in 2 minutes! The      thermometer showed a rise from -4° to 45°F.      Unfortunately, an hour and a half later, the temperature,      which had crept up to 54°F, fell back      to-4°-a drop of 58 degrees-in 27      minutes.    </p>        <h3>      YOU'LL KNOW WHEN THEY'RE AROUND    </h3>    <p>      <em>Few small birds have a voice so amazingly loud as the      tufted titmouse.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>St. Patrick and His Day</strong>    </p>    <p>      St. Patrick was a real person, but some important facts      about him remain uncertain. He may have been born as early      as 373 A.D. or as late as 395 and may have died in 461 or      in 492. We're not sure whether March 17 was his birthdate,      deathdate, or neither. We're not even certain where he was      originally from, though we do know for certain that he      wasn't from Ireland. He was kidnapped and brought to      Ireland as a youth. After 6 years of slavery, he escaped      and left the country. But after training in the church, he      returned to spread the word of Christianity throughout      Ireland. He lit an Easter fire in defiance of the High King      and then defeated the magic of the King's Druids.    </p>    <p>      Of course, Patrick's most famous legendary deed was his      driving of the snakes from Ireland with a drum and a      sermon. If I recall correctly (not to diminish the great      saint's respectability), there really are no snakes (or no      common ones?) in the Emerald Isle. And speaking of green:      the shamrock became a symbol of Ireland and St. Patrick's      Day because Patrick used it as a means for explaining the      Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Among the      considerable number of miracles attributed to Patrick:      raising his father and several other people from the dead      and burning snow to make a fire. His staff was supposedly      given to him by Christ in a vision.    </p>        <p>      St Patrick's Day also marks the beginning of the garden      season in Ireland, the time when peas-the earliest of      the vegetables-can be planted. The holiday in the      Emerald Isle still retains much of its original religious      significance, whereas, in the United States, St.      Patrick’s Day is considered a secular holiday by most      people-a day when everyone is supposed to sport a few      pieces of green attire and try to be at least a little      Irish. According to the history books, the first      celebration of the holiday on this side of the Atlantic      seems to have been in Boston in 1737.    </p>    <h3>      Almanac for February/March 1995    </h3>    <h3>      February    </h3>    <p>      <strong>1</strong> 1 First day of Ramadan, Moslem month of      fasting (begins at previous sunset-if the "young"      crescent Moon is glimpsed).    </p>    <p>      <strong>2</strong> Candlemas (feast of the Purification of      Mary); Groundhog Day (if the creature sees his shadow,      tradition says we'll have six more weeks of wintery      weather).    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong> Asteroid Ceres at opposition (opposition      is a good time to see a celestial object and Ceres is the      largest asteroid-over 600 miles across-but you      need binoculars and a detailed finder chart from a magazine      like <em>Sky & Telescope</em> to identify this      worldlet).    </p>    <p>      <strong>5</strong> Halfway point of winter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6</strong> Great snowstorm of 1978 in southeast New      England-38 inches in Rhode Island, 27 inches in      Boston (where all travel was banned for a week by the      governor); the famous Cold Friday in the South and Midwest      in 1807-the temperature stayed below 0°F. in Ohio      and Kentucky.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7</strong> FIRST QUARTER MOON, 7:53 A.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9</strong> The historic battle between the ironclad      ships <em>Monitor</em> and <em>Merrimac</em> took place on      this date in 1862 in generally fair weather.    </p>    <p>      <strong>11</strong> Mars at opposition and closest.      Opposition is when a planet is opposite the Sun and      therefore rising at sunset and visible all night long. It      is also the time when an outer planet like Mars will be      closest to Earth and appear both biggest (in the telescope)      and brightest. At this opposition, however, Mars gets no      closer than about 63 million miles from Earth.

An      "astronomical unit" or "a.u." is the average distance      between Sun and Earth, a bit less than 93 million miles.      Earth's distance from Sun varies by only about 3% during      the course of the year. Mars has a far less circular orbit,      so can come in to about 1.38 a.u. (as it did last April).    </p>    <p>      <strong>15</strong> Andrew Jackson Day (in Tennessee); the      Ides of March (at which Julius Caesar was assassinated in      44 B.C.).    </p>    <p>      <strong>16</strong> FULL MOON, 8:26 P.M. (the Sap Moon,      Crow Moon, or Lenten Moon).    </p>    <p>      <strong>17</strong> St. Patrick's Day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>18</strong> Moon very near the star Spica this      evening.    </p>    <p>      <strong>19</strong> The swallows return to San Juan      Capistrano in California.    </p>    <p>      <strong>20</strong> Spring equinox, 9:17 P.M.; Sun enters      astrological sign Aries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>22</strong> Moon very near Jupiter in south at      dawn.    </p>    <p>      <strong>23</strong> LAST QUARTER MOON, 3:10 P.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>25</strong> Annunciation (Lady Day) the day that      Gabriel announced to Mary she would bear Jesus (this day is      simply 9 months before December 25, the date tradition says      that Christ was born on);<br />      Mars halts retrograde motion, 6 degrees east of the Beehive      Star Cluster in Cancer the Crab (in the weeks after this,      watch the planet appear to drift back eastward-      toward Regulus and Leo-in relation to the background      of stars).    </p>    <p>      <strong>26</strong> Mercury-Saturn conjunction at      dawn-use binoculars and look very low in the east      only about 30 minutes before sunrise in hopes of beholding      the brighter Mercury and just possibly the dimmer point of      light of Saturn very near it; Mothering Sunday      (traditionally, a slight reprieve from the fasting of Lent      at which boys could come home from school to visit their      mothers).    </p>    <p>      <strong>28</strong> Moon fairly near Venus in southeast at      dawn.    </p>    <p>      <strong>30</strong> NEW MOON (second this month), 9:10 P.M.    </p>    <p>      <strong>31</strong> Good shot at seeing very thin Moon very      low in west about 30 minutes after sunset.    </p>
