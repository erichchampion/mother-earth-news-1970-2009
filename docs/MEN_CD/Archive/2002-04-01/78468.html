                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>        <p>      Hands down, my most commonly used kitchen knife is the 3-      to 4-inch blade paring knife. Most kitchens have several,      typically in various states of disrepair with water damaged      handles and abused blades. One of mine has enough nicks, I      consider it a serrated knife.    </p>    <p>      I had been window shopping for a set of fine German knives.      In spite of a well known cheap streak, I do appreciate      quality tools. This purchase was going to seriously nick      the family budget. It was also going to take a while. (I      don't care for credit card debt.) I had just about had it      with our current selection of parers. It was time for yet      another inexpensive, Brand X, temporary parer. What I found      this time was something else.		</p>			<p>				<strong><em>The best cheap      kitchen knife I have ever used.</em></strong>    </p>    		<p>				Let me now recommend Chicago      Cutlery's New Centurion paring knife. It has everything I      expect out of a fine German knife. The 3f-inch blade is      high carbon stainless steel with full visible tang      construction. This is quality steel that takes and holds a      keen edge. Remarkably enough it is also easy to resharpen.      Handles are also important. These are Bakelite plastic      securely attached with stainless steel rivets. They are      attractive, durable and hygienic. The knife's overall      balance is superb.</p><p>This is just what I expect of a fine      German knife from an upscale department store or kitchen      boutique. I just didn't expect it of an S8 knife at a      discount store.<br />      <br />      <strong><em>GEORGE BURNETT<br />      Spartanburg, South Carolina</em></strong>		</p>		<h3>Share Your Wisdom!</h3>    <p>      <strong>Have you learned some trick of the trade, secret      formula or way to avoid disaster around the homestead?
