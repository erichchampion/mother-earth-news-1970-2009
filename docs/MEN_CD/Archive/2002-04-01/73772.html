                <p>      <strong>Eco-Economy</strong>    </p>    		<p>Opportunity abounds in the new way of doing business		</p>		<h5 id="byline">By Lester R. Brown		</h5>        <p>      An economy is sustainable only if it respects the      principles of ecology. These principles are as real as      those of aerodynamics. If an aircraft is to fly, it has to      satisfy certain principles of thrust and lift. So, too, if      an economy is to sustain progress, it must satisfy the      basic principles of ecology. If it does not, it will      decline and eventually collapse. There is no middle ground.      An economy is either sustainable or it is not.    </p>    <p>      Today's global economy has been shaped by market forces,      not by the principles of ecology. By failing to reflect the      full costs of goods and services, the market provides      misleading information to economic decision makers at all      levels. This has created a distorted economy out of sync      with the Earth's ecosystem-an economy that is      destroying its natural support systems. (See "The Economy      & the Earth," February/March 2002.)    </p>    <p>      An eco-economy is one that satisfies our present needs      without jeopardizing the prospects of future generations;      one that sees the economy as a subset of the environment,      not the other way around.    </p>    <p>      Building a sustainable economy in the time available      requires rapid systemic change throughout the world. The      good news is the eco-economy offers a future full of      promise, one that will boost some existing industries, will      call entire new career fields into existence and will offer      enormous investment opportunity.    </p>    <h3>      NEW INDUSTRIES, NEW JOBS    </h3>    <p>      Describing the eco-economy is a somewhat speculative      undertaking. In the end, however, it is not as open-ended      as it might seem because the eco-economy's broad outlines      are defined by the principles of ecology.    </p>    <p>      Building a new economy involves phasing out old industries,      restructuring existing ones and creating new ones. World      coal use is already being phased out, dropping 7 percent      since peaking in 1996. It is being replaced by efficiency      gains in some countries; by natural gas in others, such as      the United Kingdom and China; and by wind power in others,      such as Denmark.    </p>    <p>      The automobile industry faces a major restructuring as it      changes power sources, shifting from the gasoline-powered      internal combustion engine to the hydrogen-powered fuel      cell engine. This shift will require both a retooling of      engine plants and the retraining of automotive engineers      and automobile mechanics.    </p>    <p>      The new economy also will call for major new industries,      ones that either do not yet exist or that are just      beginning. Wind electricity generation is one such      industry. Now in its embryonic stage, it promises to become      the foundation of the new energy economy. Millions of      turbines soon will be converting wind into electricity,      becoming part of the global landscape. In many countries,      wind will supply both electricity and, through the      electrolysis of water, hydrogen.    </p>    <p>      The robustness of the wind turbine industry was evident in      2000 and 2001 when high-tech stocks were in a free fall      worldwide. While high-tech firms as a group were performing      poorly, sales of wind turbines were climbing, pushing the      earnings of turbine manufacturers to the top of the charts.      Continuing growth of this sector is expected for the next      few decades.    </p>    <p>      As wind power emerges as a low-cost source of electricity      and a mainstream energy source, it will spawn another      industry: hydrogen production. Once wind turbines are in      wide use, there will be a large, unused capacity during the      night when electricity use drops. With this essentially      free electricity, turbine owners can turn on the hydrogen      generators, converting the wind power into hydrogen ideal      for fuel cell engines. Hydrogen generators will start to      replace oil refineries. The wind turbine will replace both      the coal mine and the oil well. Both wind turbines and      hydrogen generators will be widely dispersed as countries      take advantage of local wind resources.    </p>    <h3>      SHIFTING FOOD SOURCES    </h3>        <p>      Changes in the world food economy will be substantial. Some      of these, such as the shift to fish farming, are already      under way. The fastest growing subsector of the world food      economy during the 1990s was aquaculture, expanding at more      than 11 percent a year. Fish farming is likely to continue      to expand simply because of its efficiency in converting      grain into animal protein.    </p>    <p>      Even allowing for slower future growth in aquaculture, fish      farm output likely will overtake beef production during      this decade. Perhaps more surprising, fish farming could      eventually exceed the oceanic fish catch. Indeed, for      China-the world's leading consumer of      seafood-fish farming already supplies two-thirds of      the seafood while the oceanic catch accounts for the other      third.    </p>    <p>      With this development comes the need for a mixed-feed      industry, one analogous to that which provides the      nutritionally balanced rations used by the poultry industry      today. There will also be a need for aquatic ecologists,      fish nutritionists and marine veterinarians.    </p>    <h3>      TRANSFORMING TRANSPORTATION    </h3>    <p>      A major growth industry of the future is bicycle      manufacturing and service. Because the bicycle is      nonpolluting, frugal in its use of land and provides      much-needed exercise in sedentary societies, future      reliance on it is expected to grow. As recently as 1965,      the production numbers of cars and bikes were essentially      equal, but today more than twice as many bikes are      manufactured each year. Among industrial countries the      urban transport model being pioneered in the Netherlands      and Denmark-where bikes are featured      prominently-gives a sense of the bicycle's future      role worldwide.    </p>    <p>      As bicycle use expands, interest in electrically assisted      bikes is also growing. Similar to existing bicycles, except      for a tiny batterypowered electric motor that can either      power the bicycle entirely or assist elderly riders or      those living in hilly terrain, its soaring sales are      expected to continue climbing in the years ahead.    </p>    <h3>      PROFESSIONAL POSSIBILITIES    </h3>    <p>      Raising water productivity will be a rapidgrowth industry.      Just as the last halfcentury has been devoted to raising      land productivity, the next half-century will be focused on      raising water productivity. Virtually all societies will be      turning to the management of water at the watershed level      in order to manage the available supply most efficiently.      Irrigation technologies will become more efficient. Urban      wastewater recycling will become common. At present, water      tends to flow into and out of cities, carrying waste with      it. In the future, water will be used over and over, never      dis charged. Since water does not wear out, there is no      limit to how long it can be used, as long as it is purified      before reuse.    </p>    <p>      In a future of water scarcity, watershed hydrologists will      be in demand. Their responsibility will be to understand      water cycles, including its movement underground to      determine the depth and sustainable yield of aquifers.      These professionals will be at the center of watershed      management.    </p>    <p>      Another industry that will play a prominent role in the new      economy-reducing energy use-is      teleconferencing. Increasingly, for environmental reasons      and to save time, individuals will be attending conferences      electronically with both audio and visual connections. This      industry involves developing the electronic global      infrastructure, as well as the services to make this      possible. One day there likely will be thousands of firms      organizing electronic conferences.    </p>    <p>      Restructuring the global economy will create not only new      industries, but also new jobs-indeed, whole new      professions and new specialties within professions. For      example, as wind becomes an increasingly prominent energy      source, there will be a need for thousands of wind met to      analyze potential wind sites, moo", wind speeds and select      the best site wind farms. The better the data are wind      resources, the more efficient the industry will become.    </p>    <p>      Closely related to this new profession will be the      engineers who design the wind turbines. Again, appropriate      turbine size and design can vary widely according to the      site. It will be the job of wind engineers to tailor      designs to specific wind regimes to maximize electricity      generation.    </p>    <p>      Environmental architecture is also a fastgrowing      profession. Among the signposts of an environmentally      sustainable economy are buildings that are in harmony with      the environment. Environmental architects design buildings      that are energy- and materials-efficient and maximize      natural heating, cooling and lighting.    </p>    <h3>      SHIFTING AND RETRAINING    </h3>        <p>      As the world shifts from a throwaway economy, engineers      will be needed to design products that can be      recycled-from cars to computers. Once products are      designed to be disassembled quickly and easily into      component parts and materials, comprehensive recycling is      relatively easy.    </p>    <p>      Technologies used in recycling are sometimes quite      different from those used in producing from virgin raw      materials. Within the U.S. steel industry, for example,      where nearly 60 percent of all steel is produced from      scrap, the technologies used differ depending on the      feedstock. Steel manufactured in electric arc furnaces from      scrap uses far less energy than traditional openhearth      furnaces using pig iron. It will be the responsibility of      the recycling engineers to close the materials loop,      converting the linear flow-through economy into a      comprehensive recycling economy.    </p>    <p>      In countries with a wealth of geothermal energy, geothermal      geologists will locate the best sites either for power      plants or for tapping directly to heat buildings.      Retraining. petroleum geologists to master geothermal      technologies is one way of satisfying the likely surge in      demand for geothermal geologists.    </p>    <p>      If the world is to stabilize population sooner rather than      later, it will need far more family-planning midwives in      Third World communities. This growth sector will be      concentrated largely in unindustrialized countries, where      millions lack access to family planning. The same family      planning counselors who advise on reproductive health and      contraceptive use can also play a central role in      controlling the spread of HIV.    </p>    <p>      One pressing professional need, particularly in developing      countries, is for sanitary engineers who can design sewage      systems not dependent on water, a trend already under way      in some water-scarce countries. As it becomes clear using      water to wash waste away is a reckless use of a scarce      resource, a new breed of sanitary engineer will he in wide      demand. Washing waste away is even less acceptable today,      as marine ecosystems are overwhelmed by nutrient flows.      Apart from the ecological disruption of a waterbased      disposal method, there are also much higher priorities in      the use of water, such as drinking, bathing and irrigation.    </p>    <p>      Agronomists who specialize in multiple cropping and      intercropping form another new specialty likely to expand      rapidly as productive farmland becomes scarce. This      profession requires expertise in the selection of crops      that can fit together well in a'aghti rotation in various      locales and in agricultural practices that facilitate      multiple cropping    </p>    <h3>      HISTORIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES    </h3>        <p>      Restructuring the global economy so econornic progress can      be sustained represent the greatest investment opportunity      in histo ry. The conceptual shift is comparable to tha of      the Copernican Revolution in the 16th century, when      Nicolaus Copernicus challenged the view that the sun      revolved around the Earth, leading to a revolution it      thinking. In scale, the Environmental Revolution is      comparable to the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions      that preceded it.    </p>    <p>      The Agricultural Revolution involved restructuring the food      economy, shifting from a nomadic lifestyle based on hunting      and gathering to a settled lifestyle based on tilling the      soil. Although agriculture started as a supplement to      hunting and gathering, it almost entirely replaced that      original means of obtaining food. The Agricultural      Revolution has entailed clearing one-tenth of the Earth's      land surface of grass and trees for plowing. Unlike the      hunter-gathered lifestyle that had little effect on the      Earth, this new farming lifestyle literally transformed the      face of the Earth.    </p>    <p>      The Industrial Revolution has been underway for two      centuries, although it some countries it is still in its      early stages. At its foundation was a shift in source      energy from wood to fossil fuels, a shift that set the      stage for a massive expansion in economic activity. Indeed,      its distiguishing feature is the harnessing of vast amounts      of fossil energy for economic purposes. While the      Agricultural Revolution transformed the Earth's surface,      the Industrial Revolution is transforming the Earth's      atmosphere.    </p>    <p>      The additional productivity of the Industrial Revolution      unleashed enormous creative energies. It also gave birth to      new lifestyles and to the most environmentally destructive      era in human history, setting the world firmly on a course      of eventual economic decline.    </p>    <p>      The Environmental Revolution resembles the Industrial      Revolution in that each is dependent on the shift to a new      energy source. Like both earlier revolutions, the      Environmental Revolution will affect the entire world.    </p>    <p>      There are differences in scale, timing and origin among the      three revolutions. Unlike the other two, the Environmental      Revolution must be compressed into a matter of decades. The      other revolutions were driven by new discoveries, by      advances in technology, whereas this revolution is being      driven more by our instinct for survival.    </p>    <p>      There has not been an investment situation like this      before. The amount the world spends now each year on oil,      the leading source of energy, provides some insight into      how much it could spend on energy in the eco-economy. In      2000 the world used nearly 28 billion barrels of oil, some      76 million barrels per day. At $27 a barrel, this comes to      $756 billion per year. How many wind turbines will it take      to produce this much energy? How many solar rooftops? How      many geothermal wells?    </p>    <p>      One big difference between the investments in fossil fuels      and those in wind power, solar cells and geothermal energy      is the latter will supply energy in perpetuity. These      "wells" will not run dry. If the money spent on oil in      <em>one year</em> were invested in wind turbines, the      electricity generated would be able to meet one-fifth of      the worlds needs.    </p>    <p>      Investments in the infrastructure for the new energy      economy, which eventually will have to be made as fossil      fuels are depleted, obviously will be huge. These include      the transmission lines that connect wind farms with      electricity consumers and the pipelines that link hydrogen      supply sources with endusers. To a substantial degree, the      infrastructure for the existing energy      economy-transmission lines for electricity and      pipelines for natural gas-can be used in the new      energy economy, as well. The local pipeline distribution      network in various cities for natural gas easily can he      converted to hydrogen.    </p>    <p>      For unindustrialized countries, the new energy sources      promise to reduce dependence on imported oil, freeing      capital for investment in domestic energy sources. Although      few countries have their own oil fields, all have wind and      solar energy. In terms of economic expansion and job      generation, these new energy technologies are a godsend.    </p>    <p>      No sector of the global economy will be untouched by the      Environmental Revolution. In the new economy, some      companies will be winners and some will be losers. Those      who anticipate the emerging economy and plan for it will he      the winners. Those who cling to the past risk becoming part      of it.    </p>    <h3>      Eco-Economy = Sunset for Some Old Industries    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Coal mining<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      The 7 percent decline in world coal burning since it peaked      in 1996 will accelerate in the years ahead.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oil pumping<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Projections based on shrinking oil reserves indicate      production will peak and start declining in the next five      to 20 years. Concerns about global warming could bring the      decline closer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nuclear power generation</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Although public concern focuses on safety issues, it is the      industry's high cost that is ensuring its decline.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Clearcut logging</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      The rapid spread in eco-labeling of forest products likely      will force logging firms to change to sustainable      harvesting or be driven out of business.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Manufacture of throwaway products</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      As efforts to close the materials cycle intensify,      throwaway products will be either banned or taxed out of      existence.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Automobile manufacturing</strong><br />      As world population urbanizes, the conflict between the      automobile and the city will intensify, reducing dependence      on automobiles.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Expanding industries in the      Eco-Economy</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>Fish farming</strong> Although growth will slow      from the double-digit rate of the last decade, rapid      expansion is likely to continue.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bicycle manufacturing</strong> Bicycles will become      increasingly common because they are nonpolluting, quiet,      require little parking space and provide much-needed      exercise.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Wind farm construction</strong></strong>      Wind-electric generation, including offshore wind farms,      will grow rapidly over rt the next few decades, until wind      is supplying most of the world's electricity.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Wind turbine      manufacturing</strong></strong> Today the number of      utility-scale wind turbines is measured in the thousands,      but soon it will be measured in the millions, creating an      enormous manufacturing opportunity.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Hydrogen generation</strong></strong> As      the transition from a carbon-based to a hydrogen-based      economy progresses, hydrogen generation will become a huge      industry as hydrogen replaces coal and oil.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Fuel cell manufacturing</strong></strong>      As fuel cells replace internal combustion engines in      automobiles and begin generating power in buildings, a huge      market will evolve.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Solar cell manufacturing</strong></strong>      For many of the two billion people living in rural Third      World communities who lack electricity, solar cells will be      the best bet for electrification.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Light rail construction</strong></strong>      Cities in industrial and unindustrialized countries alike      will be turning to light rail to provide mobility as people      tire of traffic congestion and pollution.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tree planting<br />      <br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      As efforts to reforest the Earth gain momentum and as tree      plantations ex pand, tree planting will emerge as a leading      economic activity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Professional Opportunities</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Abound in the Eco-Economy</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wind meteorologists</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wind meteorologists will play a role in the new energy      economy comparable to that of petroleum geologists in the      old one.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Foresters</strong> Reforesting the Earth will      require professional guidance on what species to plant      where, and in what combination.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hydrologists</strong> As water scarcity spreads,      the demand for hydrologists to advise on watershed      management, water sources and water efficiency will      increase.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Recycling Engineers</strong> Designing consumer      appliances so they can be easily taken apart and recycled      completely will be a growing engineering specialty.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Agricultural Veterinarians</strong> Until now,      veterinarians have typically specialized in either large      animals or small animals, but with fish farming likely to      overtake beef production before the end of this decade,      marine veterinarians will be in demand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ecological economists</strong> As it becomes clear      that the basic principles of ecology must be incorporated      into economic planning and polic.making, the demand will      grow for economists able to think like ecologists.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Geothermal geologist</strong> With the likelihood      that large areas of the world will turn to geothermal      energy for electricity and for heating, demand for      geothermal geologists will climb.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Environmental architects</strong> Architects are      learning the principles of ecology so they can incorporate      them into the buildings in which we live and work.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bicycle Mechanics</strong> As the world turns to      the bicycle for transportation and exercise, bicycle      mechanics will be needed to keep the fleet running.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Family planning midwives</strong> If world      population is to stabilize soon, millions of family      planning midwives will be needed in nonindustrialized      countries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wind</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>turbine engineers</strong> With millions of wind      turbines likely to be installed in the decades ahead, there      will be strong worldwide demand for wind turbine engineers.    </p>    <p>      ABOUT THE AUTHOR    </p>        <p>      This is the second of two excerpts from Lester R. Brown's      new book, Eco-Economy: Building an Economy for the Earth,      detailing changes that must be made now to ensure a      healthy, sustainable future. Brown has devoted his life to      monitoring the world from his post at the Worldwatch      Institute, which he founded in 1974. The Institute's highly      respected annual "State of the World" reports have provided      solid evidence of the interrelated environmental and social      crises the world now faces. Brown's new organization, the      Earth Policy Institute, provides a vision of an      environmentally sustainable economy and an ongoing      assessment of the effort to create it. in this excerpt      Brown o lines some of the systemic changes needed and the      opportunity available in the restructured economy he      envisions.    </p>    <p>      <em>Read Eco-Economy: Building an Economy for the Earth      online at www.earthpolicy.org , where you can download the      book and sign up to receive regular Eco-Economy Updates.
