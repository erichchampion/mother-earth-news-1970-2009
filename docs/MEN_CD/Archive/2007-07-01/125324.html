        <p>Mother Earth Living recently spoke with Genevieve Gorder,celebrity designer from television's<a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html" target="_blank">Trading Spaces</a>,<a href="http://www.tv.com/town-haul/show/28752/summary.html" target="_blank">TownHaul</a>. Genevieve grew up remodeling homes with her family andhas been preserving homes and using salvaged materials ever since.Her fun-loving approach to interior design and working barefoot areher trademarks.<a href="http://www.flooranddecoroutlets.com/" target="_blank">Floor & DecorOutlets of America</a>, specializing in hard flooring products,recently chose Genevieve as spokesperson as the company expandsnationwide. Here's what she had to say about do-it-yourself greenremodeling.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What is it about DIY that makes it fun andrewarding?</em></strong></p><br /><p>I think that it can feel like a laborious process, but thereward is that you have an environment that is designed by you foryou. That's precious. That is absolutely what it should be. Yourpersonality should be tangible in a space and only you can do that.Once you're educated and become knowledgeable enough, it's babysteps. It's going to stores like Floor & D?cor and other storesthat partner with you that make the process less daunting. And Ialways recommend scouting out what you want to do online before yougo anywhere?so you know your stuff. Be smart about it. Then you canhave fun.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What would you say to people who don't think theyhave the right skills or personality for DIYprojects?</em></strong></p><br /><p>All of that is really based around fear: the fear of the unknownand making the wrong decision with materials and design products.People often think of all these things as having so much permanencethat they're stuck if they make the wrong decision. The Internetmakes it a lot easier to find products. You can check out differentprices or what not. I think that the Internet is the greatest DIYtool there is.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What are the best first steps for a DIYer or homeowner to take if they'd like to 'go green'?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Don't be scared. All of these products have been around forcenturies if you look at some of the really classic things. Thenatural products?wood, stone, even tiling?never go out of style. Gofor things that aren't trendy, but are classic and will stand thetest of time. It will save the environment a lot of mess and you'llsave yourself a lot of work and a lot of money.<br /><br /><strong><em>Where would you encourage home owners to 'splurge'when building green?</em></strong></p><br /><p>The first thing and probably most important, just in the qualityof your life, would be the windows; energy efficiency is somethingyou may have to splurge on initially, but will end up saving youmoney in the end. I would start there, but I would encourage urbanbeasts as well as country peeps to really look into solar optionsbecause they're getting more affordable.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What is your favorite green building material ortechnique? Why?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Materials that are made locally. Reclaimed wood is a greatsource to use on the outside or the inside of your house. It hassuch soul.</p><br /><p>Also, I can't say enough about bamboo. It's a material that'sbeen around for centuries and used in other parts of the world veryregularly from scaffolding to flooring to exteriors of homes. It'sjust now gaining more popularity in America and it's one of thedensest and strongest woods you can buy. And you can get, in somestates, a tax incentive when you use it in your home or business,because it's a green product.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What's green about your home?</em></strong></p><br /><p>My primary residence is about 200 years old, so it's been used alot. We just did some major, major renovations. We got all of ourdoors, our hardware and a lot of our stone from architecturalsalvage yards. It's very eclectic and very much us, but it has thesubstantial qualities of that time: thicker doors that aren'thollow vinyl and doorknobs that are wrought iron and have beenantiqued by 120 years of little hands in the New York publicschools.</p><br /><p><strong><em>Which project has been the most challenging/the mostrewarding?</em></strong></p><br /><p>We have a really old farmhouse in the Catskills of New York, andwe bought it with land that we wanted to save from subdivisions andkeep really open. We're building a new house on the property aswell because the farmhouse was in such bad shape. It was almostbeyond our pocket book to salvage. Instead of making it bigger andmore grandiose with more materials, we're making it a lot smaller,using a lot of recycled goods, and working with Floor and D?cor andusing a lot of their products.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What's your next big project?</em></strong></p><br /><p>I just switched networks and I will be appearing in my own showon <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/" target="_blank">HGTV</a> next year. I'm going tohave a new design show. It will explain a lot of the design logicand science behind what we do. It's important to explain to peoplethe meat of design?it takes a lot of that fear out of being yourown personal designer or DIY/construction person. That's my goal:to really eliminate that fear so we can all graduate to the nextlevel and start getting more creative.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What's up with working withoutshoes?</em></strong></p><br /><p>It's nothing to do with any movement at all. My feet aren't evencute; I played soccer for way too many years. The only reason Idon't wear shoes is that I didn't want to wreak my shoes with allof the materials that I'm using: paint, varnish, poly, all of thatstuff. I really like my shoes?I live in New York. That's the way weare. I do buy nice shoes, and I would like to keep them for awhile. And I'm very comfortable barefoot.</p><br /><p><strong><em>Why do you find DIY fun and rewarding?
