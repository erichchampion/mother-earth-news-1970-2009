                    <p>      <em>Although patches of snow may still stand on some      north-facing hillsides, it's time for the first course on      the spring foraging menu ...</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by E.S. O'NEILL    </h5>        <p>      "Them brake ferns ain't no good," the old "stump rancher"      told me, "they pizens the ground so's you cain't grow      nothin else!" This conversation took place in the Oregon      woods during the 1930's, and the speaker lived in a crude      pine shack with no garden to be seen. The odds are pretty      good that he-along with his flock of sallow-faced      children-was suffering from malnutrition.    </p>    <p>      Of course, there's no way that this man could have known      that brake (or bracken) ferns <em>don't</em> poison the      ground (they actually just prefer soil that's too acid for      other crops), but his experience with the "weed" might have      led him to reason that if he couldn't <em>lick</em> the      blasted ferns, he ought to "join 'em". Had he made this      assumption, he could even have come to realize that his      runty, scrubby field of bracken was actually a garden in      disguise!    </p>    <p>      In fact, with the addition of some miner's lettuce and      violet leaves (both of which coexist nicely with bracken)      the homesteader could have had fresh greens for his table      through a good portion of the growing season!    </p>    <p>      And, since research has shown us that the sprouting tips of      plants are usually high in protein, vitamins, and minerals,      I'm convinced that-had the old squatter been able to      read the directions that follow-his family would have      been healthier and happier for their association with the      common "brake".    </p>    <h3>      FIRST, THOUGH, A WARNING    </h3>    <p>      You should know that there is a mild poison in the mature      specimens of the genus <em>Pteridium</em> . And, were you      to eat 24 pounds of <em>adult</em> bracken a day for 30      consecutive days, you might have some problems. Even if you      <em>were</em> tempted to indulge in such a bovine orgy,      however, you could avoid disaster by <em>not</em> eating      the fully developed leaves that contain the toxic matter.      New, leafless shoots are safe (although these should be      cooked to break down the enzyme thiaminase ... which      destroys vitamin B 1 and could-again, if great      quantities were eaten-lead to a B 1 deficiency).    </p>    <p>      It's also important to be sure that you are picking the      correct fern. (As an aid to identification, refer to the      photos accompanying this article, or get a good field      guide.) The plant that you're after is the common brake or      bracken fern, <em>Pteridium</em> (or <em>Pteris</em> )      <em>aquilinum</em> , which can be identified by the fact      that its fronds fan out-usually in groups of      three-from a central stalk ... producing a coarse but      beautiful plant that can reach a height of 50 or 60 inches!    </p>    <p>      Bracken shouldn't be difficult for anyone to locate,      though. It springs up in pastures, orchards, and along      forest edges throughout most of North America ... in fact,      most authorities agree that the brake is the United States'      most common fern.    </p>    <p>      Near my home in the Sierra Nevada, for example, bracken      literally covers square <em>miles</em> of middle-elevation      land. Yet this valuable plant is an overlooked and wasted      food source throughout most of its range. (Every rule, of      course, demands an exception . . . and the bracken fern is      regarded as a delicacy in French Canada.)    </p>    <p>      The succulent plant should be picked when the first sprouts      come up from the knotty rhizomes (roots) in the early      spring. In cool (or high) locations, however, the bracken      "season" can stretch into August. Just be sure the      curled-over, aspara-guslike shoots haven't opened up yet,      and that the roll on their tips still justifies the      nickname "fiddlenecks".    </p>    <p>      It's an easy matter to gather a mess of the tasty fronds.      Look for shoots less than a foot high (it's often easiest      to locate last year's dried, brown growth first) and snap      'em off at the point where they break cleanly (like a fresh      green bean). When tasted raw, the shoots are slightly      bitter and unattractive to most folks' palates, although      the Miwok Indians are said to have enjoyed their      fiddlenecks uncooked.    </p>    <p>      In order to prepare your bounty, begin by washing the      fronds . . . rubbing them-as you wash-to remove      the silvery fuzz (sure, you'll miss some of this furry      coating, but the cooking water will take care of any that      you overlook). Then, cut the fronds up (or leave them      whole), and plunge them into enough boiling water to cover      the whole batch. (At this stage the fiddlenecks will give      off a bitter-almond smell, which disappears with cooking.)      Allow the pot to return to a boil, then drain the liquid      off.    </p>    <p>      You'll probably want to repeat the boil-and-drain process      two more times. When that's done, however, you should cover      your fern feast with water for a <em>fourth</em> time and      let it boil for half an hour or more. The shoots will be      done when they're tender and don't taste the least bit      bitter. (And, of course, if <em>fewer</em> boilings produce      the same end result, so much the better.)    </p>    <p>      When the fiddlenecks are ready, drain them again (this is      one cooking water that I don't save for reuse). The "mock      asparagus" (we call it "Sierragus" in honor of our locale)      can then be served hot with butter, or floated in cream      sauce or melted cheese. And, if you prefer to eat them      cold, fiddlenecks are great when marinated in oil and      vinegar, or topped with your favorite salad dressing.      Should you want to whip up a <em>real</em> "wild food      gourmet" treat, however, I suggest that you try the      following:    </p>    <h3>      FIDDLENECK FRITTATA    </h3>    <p>      Use the above procedure to prepare 1-2/3 cups of boiled      fiddlenecks. Then-in a separate bowl-mix 1      clove of finely minced garlic, 3 eggs, a thick slice of      French bread (crumbled), 1/2 pound of grated Jack cheese, 2      tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 teaspoon of      grated nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of crumbled. dried basil (or      two tablespoons of this herb, if it's fresh and chopped),      and salt and pepper to taste. Add the fiddlenecks to this      mixture and stir thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      After the ingredients are all combined, pour one tablespoon      of olive oil into a medium-sized iron frying pan and heat      it up. When the pan is hot enough to sizzle, pour in the      <em>frittata</em> mixture, patting it out (if necessary) to      fill the base of the container. Then, cover the pan with a      flat lid (or metal plate) which has been oiled on the      "under" side. Cook your fern delight over very low heat for      10 minutes, or until it becomes quite firm and is browned      on the bottom.    </p>    <p>      Now for the tricky part. Once the underside of the mixture      is done, quickly invert the pan so that the "pancake" will      fall onto the lid. Then, slide the frittata (brown side      up!) back into the pan, cover, and cook slowly for about      five minutes more.    </p>    <p>      (As an alternative, this dish can be baked at 350Â° F      for about 30 minutes and then browned under the broiler.      But cooking frittatas on top of the stove in a heavy      skillet is the traditional Italian method of preparing      these delicacies and would-of course-lend      itself to the limited "kitchen" available to most campers.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, cut the frittata into wedges and serve it (a      bottle of Chianti might well be called for, too). This      recipe will make a delicious dinner dish for four hungry      folks.    </p>    <p>      So, when that early spring hankerin' for fresh greens hits      you, ferret out some fiddlenecks .. . and, as the Italians      would say, <em>buon appetito</em> !    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: More information about gathering and      preparing wild foods can be found in the following      volumes:</em></p><p> 1. <em>Stalking the Wild Asparagus by Euell      Gibbons (David McKay, 1970).
