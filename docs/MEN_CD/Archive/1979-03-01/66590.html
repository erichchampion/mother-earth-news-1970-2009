    <p>
                <p>      <em>In MOTHER NO. 54, we learned of Dr. Harold Manner's      successful laetrile/nutrition treatments for<br />      cancer. Now, Dore Deverell-who has used these and      other techniques-reports on ...</em>    </p>            <p>      When I learned-in 1972-that I had cancer of the breast,      groin, stomach, pancreas, and liver, I immediately started      to research the physical causes of the disease.      But-since I maintain that most illnesses stem from      psychological sources-the emotional causes concerned      me even more.    </p>    <p>      I also knew that the effects of nutrition on cancer would      be of prime importance to me . . . since I had-20      years earlier-used nutrition therapy as a self-cure      for an extreme case of hemorrhaging and edema.    </p>    <p>      In fact, I've never believed in the treatment of symptoms      instead of causes, and I had decided years before      that-if I ever had cancer-I would not submit to      the brutal surgical, radiation, and chemotherapy treatments      I had watched a close friend endure.<br />      My friend had first gone through a complete mastectomy,      then had both of her <em>healthy</em> ovaries removed to      prevent the production of female hormones. She suffered      through a long series of cobalt treatments and became      horribly ill from the side effects of chemotherapy . . .      only to eventually die of lung cancer.    </p>    <h3>      THE CANCER PERSONALITY    </h3>    <p>      When I had to face my <em>own</em> illness, I finally      acknowledged that I fell into a category known as "the      cancer personality''. I had first heard of this "type" of      person through Dr. O. Carl Simonton, a young radiologist      from Fort Worth, Texas,<br />      <br />      Dr. Simonton wanted to help cancer patients with something      more than radiation, and he developed a biofeedback system      that employs the power of the mind to change the body's      processes. (Biofeedback works ... it is widely used in many      applications today.) But, when the doctor taught this      technique to his patients, he discovered that it      <em>also</em> put them in direct contact with feelings that      had been repressed for years, and that the cancer victims      who faced and worked out these negative emotions were the      ones who eventually recovered. With that knowledge, the      radiologist began to prescribe private and group      psychotherapy for his patients.    </p>    <p>      There are (according to Dr. Simonton) three main attributes      of the cancer personality: First, the person has a poor      self-image . . . his or her identity is bound up in seeking      the approval of others. Second, the typical cancer      victim-even <em>before</em> the onset of      disease-feels sorry for him-or herself, because that      person is apt to be living in latent despair. And, finally,      the "cancer type" is unable to forgive and forget, and is,      therefore, unlikely to have long-term successful      relationships.    </p>    <p>      The theory is that there's a core of helplessness and      hopelessness at the center of <em>every</em> cancer      personality. And all of these subconscious, negative      feelings have to be discovered, dissipated, and      reprogrammed into positive feelings of self-worth . . .      into the ability to laugh at oneself and one's predicaments      . . . and into learning to love-despite weaknesses      and mistakes-both oneself and others.    </p>    <p>      Experts in the field-including the late Dr. Gotthard      Booth, a New York City psychiatrist-believe that      "overcoming cancer is overcoming despair". Dr. Booth's      research showed that a cancer-prone person often      experiences this latent anguish because of a childhood      devoid of a nurturing relationship with one or both      parents. The person never learned to trust,      and-consequently-developed a personality that      felt secure only when in control of life's situations. When      such a man or woman loses control of a main goal (whether      that goal involves spouse, child, or career), all the      buried despair and helplessness rise to the surface . . .      and the cancer process begins.    </p>    <h3>      HELPLESSNESS TO SELF-CONFIDENCE    </h3>    <p>      The more I studied the cancer personality, the more I      identified with it. And, within six weeks of the discovery      of my illness, I finally tapped the core of my personal      problem and was completely inundated by waves of      overwhelming helplessness. I realized then that I had felt      this way all of my life, but that-like many other      cancer personalities-I'd covered these emotions with      a great show of self-sufficiency. If I hadn't repressed      such feelings. I probably wouldn't have been able to get      out of bed in the morning . . . much less cope with life.    </p>    <p>      It took a lot of hard work to reprogram my emotions. I      spent 10 to 15 minutes three times a day telling myself      that I was no longer a child at the mercy of sick, neurotic      parents . . . that I was an adult now and capable of taking      care of myself. I even made a cassette tape, on which I      said things like: "You can do anything you want to do, you      are strong, you are intelligent," etc. . . . and I listened      to it every day.    </p>    <p>      The therapy which enabled me to uncover the blocked      emotions is called "Psychosynthesis", and the treatment has      many techniques . . . not only to put patients in touch      with their repressed feelings, but also to      <em>reprogram</em> those feelings and restructure and      integrate the personality. And, from the time I made my      "breakthrough", I've progressed rapidly in emotional      health.    </p>    <p>      I also used biofeedback for almost a year ... as a means to      reactivate my immune mechanism. Space doesn't permit a      detailed discussion of that technique except to describe      what I did three times every day:    </p>    <p>      First, I would picture-with my creative      imagination-a light in the form of white, bulletlike      radiation going to the cancer sites and killing the cancer      cells. Then, I would "see" the white corpuscles rush over,      pick up the dead cancer cells, and carry them out of the      body through the waste system . . . just the way the immune      mechanism is supposed to work (but doesn't) in the cancer      patient.    </p>    <h3>      DETOXIFICATION WITH DIET    </h3>    <p>      Meanwhile, for my physical treatment, I was led to a book      by Dr. William D. Kelley called <em>One Answer to      Cancer</em> (available for $3.25 postpaid from the      International Association of Cancer Victims, 7740 West      Manchester. Suite 110. Playa del Rey. California 90291).      This volume taught me that the first thing I had to do was      detoxify my body ... in order to get rid of the poisons      that had accumulated for years while I ate the wrong foods.      (In addition, the cancer itself throws a lot of toxins into      the bloodstream.) I eliminated these poisons with juices,      fasting, coffee enemas, saunas, deep breathing, massage,      and exercise.    </p>    <p>      I became a vegetarian and swore off meat, poultry, fish,      and dairy products with the exception of yogurt. In      addition, I stopped eating all processed and refined foods,      and I also cut out caffeine, cigarettes, alcohol, soft      drinks, white sugar, white flour, and any products made      with the last two items.    </p>    <p>      Since cooking destroys the enzymes which we need so badly,      I ate mostly raw food, and drank gallons of fruit and      vegetable juices. I ate apricot kernels, too, because they      contain B-17 (also known as laetrile or amygdalin) . . .      which has been shown to help cancer patients.<br />      A typical day's physical regimen went like this.    </p>    <p>      <em>Early morning</em> : one teaspoon of chia seeds which      had been soaked overnight in fresh grape juice. (These      seeds were a staple of the Aztecs and are still popular in      Mexico and the American Southwest.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Breakfast</em> (30 minutes later): raw cereal made of a      combination of wheat berries, buckwheat, rye, barley, oat      groats, millet, sesame, brown rice, flax, corn, alfalfa,      lentils, mung beans, and almonds (I would grind three or      four table-spoons of this mixture, soak it in water      overnight, and add raisins or date sugar for flavor, but no      milk). My breakfast also included 16 apricot kernels, 16      almonds, and one tablespoon of acidophilus.    </p>    <p>      <em>After breakfast</em> : coffee enema.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mid-morning</em> : the juice of two oranges, one      grapefruit, and one lemon ... in an equal amount of water.    </p>    <p>      <em>Before lunch</em> : swim at the club, sauna twice      weekly, sunbathe when possible.<br />      <em>Lunch</em> : fruit salad and yogurt with ground sesame      seeds and more almonds.<br />      <em>Afternoon</em> : one quart of carrot juice and one pint      of celery juice.<br />      <em>Dinner</em> : green salad with sunflower, sesame, and      pumpkin seeds . . . and whole grain toast spread with      sesame-seed butter.    </p>    <p>      My food supplements-which were the same for all three      meals-included two hydrochloric acid tablets, two      capsules of chelated minerals, two potassium tablets, three      kelp tablets, and 400 units of vitamin E before each meal.      Then after each meal I'd take 1,000 mg. of vitamin C,      20,000 mg. of vitamin A, 800 mg. of vitamin D, one      high-potency vitamin B capsule, six predigested protein      tablets, two pancreatin (pancreatic enzymes) tablets, and      six dessicated liver tablets. (I became quite expert at      swallowing up to 10 pills at a gulp!) I also took two      comfrey-pepsin tablets between meals- an herb mixture      which Dr. Kelley says clears the mucus out of the small      intestine-and extra pancreatin tablets in      midafternoon and between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. ... so they      could attack the cancer when there was no protein to be      digested.<br />      <br />      I purchased a vegetable juicer, so I could have my nectar      fresh, and-in between juices-I drank herb teas      such as chaparral and red clover.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, my diet was almost totally raw. For some      ideas and inspiration, I bought <em>Raw Vegetable      Juices</em> by N.W. Walker (O'Sullivan, Woodside & Co.,      2218 East Magnolia, Phoenix, Arizona 85034) and John H.      Tobe's " <em>No-Cook" Book</em> (The Provoker Press,      Lake-shore Road, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada L2R 7C9),      plus a couple other vegetarian cookbooks.    </p>    <p>      After the first 30 days on my diet, I cut the daily coffee      enemas down to twice weekly, and-after nine      months-I felt so good that I eliminated most of the      food supplements. Now, I only take vitamins C, E, B, A, and      D.    </p>    <p>      When I had been on this regimen for several months and most      of my symptoms had disappeared, I went to see a nutrition      doctor and had some tests run. They showed that-even      though my blood was still in a toxic condition-I was      completely free of any malignancy.<br />      That didn't really surprise me, for I had learned in my      research that-if you have 50"% use of your vital      organs-you can recover from cancer. And, according to      Dr. Max Gerson and other cancer experts, it's a fairly      simple matter to get rid of a malignancy . . . but it takes      time, hard work, and lots of discipline to build the body      back to health and to reactivate the immune system.    </p>        <h3>      THE LESSONS OF CANCER    </h3>    <p>      I'm actually grateful that I had this deadly disease,      because of the tremendous changes it made in my life.    </p>    <p>      First of all, I feel better physically, emotionally, and      mentally than I have ever felt before. When I got rid of      that core of helplessness, I found it possible (at age 55)      to launch a career in writing, lecturing, teaching, and      private counseling in Psychenutrition ... a wholistic      approach that combines therapy for the body, mind, and      spirit. And, I now feel so physically vibrant that I go to      the beach every day, jog a mile, and then swim in the ocean      . . . summer <em>and</em> winter.    </p>    <p>      I've also discovered that <em>many</em> folks have healed      their cancer and other killer diseases through nutrition      and various unorthodox methods. And, that there are      dedicated, courageous doctors, professionals, and laymen      who work hard to get this information to the public.    </p>    <p>      There are also organizations that aid people with cancer,      and these groups led me to the books that helped me. The      International Association of Cancer Victims, for example,      has been working with cancer patients for 14 years and has      a tremendous bibliography of information. The Association      also provides referrals to doctors who treat cancer by      natural methods . . . instead of the "usual" surgery,      radiation, and chemotherapy.    </p>    <p>      And, finally, the <em>main</em> thing that I've learned is      that I'm responsible for my health. (Good health is so      simple really, if you take the responsibility and do a      little research.)    </p>    <p>      Today, I put nothing but pure and nutritious food into my      body and mind, because-to add a little of my own to      the famous quotation-"As a man <em>thinks and      eats</em> ...so is he".    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you would like more details on Dore's      experience with cancer, you can order her book</em>      -How I Healed My Cancer Holistically-      <em>directly from the author, P.O.
