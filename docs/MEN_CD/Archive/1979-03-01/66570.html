                		<hr />    <p>      <strong><em>Gay Neale reminds us that-with a little      imagination-you can recycle darn near      anything!</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      There's a new kind of extruded plastic, two-liter, soft      drink bottle on the market that can be turned-in a      matter of minutes-into a great little terrarium. And      you don't even have to like what's inside the      bottle-much less drink it-to make one of these      miniature greenhouses. In fact, you'll do yourself and the      world a favor if you scrounge roadsides, or public      "dumpsters" for your supply of empties.    </p>    <p>      When you have one of these throwaways in hand, just pop off      the black plastic bottom section. (This requires a bit of      force, but it will come off if you squeeze the clear top      enough to get a firm grip on the outer layer of plastic.)      Then, behold! The base of the bottle is an instant      flowerpot . . . it even has three holes in it for drainage.    </p>    <p>      Now, with a sharp or serrated knife slice the clear part of      the bottle-across its diameter-just at the      point before it begins to taper. There's a small bulge here      that you should be able to feel, and when you divide the      container immediately below that . . . you have a plastic      dome!    </p>    <p>      The next step is to cut a small slit-about two inches      long-on one side of the dome. Then, overlap (very      slightly) the two edges of the cut . . . insert the open      end of the dome into the pot . . . and you'll wind up with      a very efficient terrarium, miniature hothouse,      seed-starting bed, or sprouter (to grow edible sprouts, put      wet paper towels in the bottom instead of dirt).    </p>    <p>      If you want to, you can leave the label on to provide a      sunshade for tender seedlings, then rip it off later. The      label (or any remnant thereof) also makes a handy place to      jot down the dome's contents.    </p>    <p>      In fact, nothing need be wasted in this operation. Even the      leftover neck of the container can be used as a funnel or      as a "hot-cap" for delicate garden plants.    </p>    <p>      All in all, bottle recycling is almost enough to drive you      to drink . . . soft drinks, anyway!    </p>

CENTER, RIGHT: Then, cut the clear inner bottle, just below its upper bulge. BOTTOM, RIGHT: Finally, make a two-inch slit down one side of the resulting dome, overlap the cut's edges, and fit the rounded piece into the flat-bottomed base. LEFT: And there you have it ... an attractive (and efficient!) recycled soda bottle terrarium!
