        <p>If you've ever had a good little shed, you know their usefulnessranks right up there with rakes, chain saws and duct tape. Ifyou've never had one, you may not know what you're missing. Andit's not that difficult to build a simple shed. In fact, anyonethinking about building a house someday probably should build ashed ? it gives you a chance to practice many of the same designand construction techniques.</p><br /><p>As with most major, semi-permanent projects, your eventualsuccess depends on the time and thought you spend in planning.</p><br /><p>A first consideration: Learn whether you'll have to deal withlegal or zoning restrictions. Many localities have regulations thatcan affect the placement (and perhaps design and materials) of yourshed. It's best to find out up front and avoid surprises later. Acall to your local building authorities should be all ittakes.<br /><br /> Now that you know what you can't do, take a look at your propertyand imagine what you can do. Look for reasonably level spots, andavoid areas with poor drainage. Think through how you'll use theshed: for tool storage, as a workshop, as a potting shed orartist's studio, or a combination? Different uses dictate differentdimensions and sizes, as well as placement of doors andwindows.</p><br /><p>Think next about appearance. You could build a shed to matchyour house, or take off in a complete architectural departure. Youcan make literally hundreds of variations in design, style andfinish. Basic proportions, roof shape, door and window style, androof and wall finish surfaces combine to create your shed'sambience. Working on this scale, you can indulge whims you mightnot be able to afford on a larger building. Go ahead, add thatcedar shake roof or weathervane or cupola.</p><br /><p>Start by making rough sketches, refining until you get thedesign right. Once you're close, take it to graph paper tofine-tune sizes. At this point, do your best to take advantage ofstandard lumber sizes ? alter the plan if it leads to economy. Drawup the floor plan and a detailed sketch of each wall, includingopenings for doors and windows. With detailed plans, you can writeup an accurate lumberyard shopping list.</p><br /><p>When it comes time to build, here are some pointers:</p><br /><p><strong>Build a firm foundation.</strong> Whether you pour aconcrete slab, pour footings, set posts in the ground, or build onrocks or block on the surface, make sure your foundation is solidand reasonably level.</p><br /><p><strong>Keep the building square, plumb and level.</strong> It'sworth taking the time to get this right. Square off your rim joistsby measuring for equal diagonals. With some foundations you mayneed to add shims to get the rim level. Before you raise the walls,square them up and add temporary diagonal braces.</p><br /><p><strong>Work efficiently.</strong> Designate a scrap pile, andput all cutoffs there. Settle on a place to keep your tools ? it'sfrustrating to spend 20 minutes looking for something you need for10 seconds. If you need to make repetitive cuts, such as the angledtops and notches in rafters, craft a perfect template and use it asa pattern for the rest.</p><br /><p><strong>Consider critter-proofing.</strong> Put metal screenover ventilation openings, unless you want to share your shed withwasps and bats. If your floor is raised off the ground, screen orblock off the area under the building. Otherwise, you may attractundesirable tenants such as raccoons or skunks.</p><br /><p><strong>Take your time.</strong> It's easy to get carried awayby enthusiasm, but realize that it will take considerable time tobuild even a small shed that will last and look good. Make areasonable estimate of the time you think each step will take ?then double it, especially if you're inexperienced.</p><br /><p><strong>Above all, work safely.</strong> Be careful with laddersand power tools, and be especially cautious when working on theroof.</p><br /><p>If you've built a shed of your own, we invite you to offer yourtips, joys, frustrations and suggestions.
