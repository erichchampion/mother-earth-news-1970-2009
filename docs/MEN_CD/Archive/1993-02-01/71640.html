                <p>      BARTER    </p>        <p>      <strong>A determined New Mexican family frees itself from      today's market economy.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By kay Matthews    </h5>        <p>      Over the past 20 years, my husband Mark and I have bartered      everything from a two-week vacation in a mountain cabin to      a hernia operation for Mark. Trading our time, labor, and      skills seems so much more intimate and humane then selling      ourselves on the free market for money (worth much less, I      must admit). So that's why we moved here, to northern New      Mexico, where people still maintain a diverse enough      lifestyle to keep bartering alive.    </p>    <p>      Back in the early '70s, when we started out in Placitas,      New Mexico, a small Hispanic village at the north end of      the Sandia Mountains, we didn't have many skills to offer      in trade. What we did have was a desire to live a simpler      life in a community more in touch with its      environment-the antidote to our lives as suburban      children of the '50s. Placitas provided a community with      200-year ties to the land, where people tended their      gardens and orchards, raised chickens and goats, and took      care of their own needs as best they could. Surviving on      part-time jobs in Albuquerque, the state's largest city 25      miles away, we rented a 100-yearold house in the village,      turned over a garden plot, and began our apprenticeship in      subsistence living.    </p>    <p>      When our roof started leaking like a sieve, our landlord      traded us a month's rent to fix it. To figure out how to      fix it in the future, we took care of our friend Tom's kids      in exchange for his expertise. When the leech lines blocked      up, we bartered another month's rent. I'll never forget      those days in the middle of January, digging through the      frozen ground to replace old tar-paper pipe with PVC. We      even had Mark's 20-year-old cousin, Marian (who was      visiting from New York), out there with us, picking and      shoveling away.    </p>    <p>      While learning the joys of house repair, Mark and I were      initiated into the rites of the acequia, or irrigation      system. A mayordomo controlled the water rights,      determining how much and on which days you could irrigate      your garden and orchard. On the day you needed to irrigate,      you had to track him down in order to request the water.      Then you had to make sure that your neighbor, after seeing      the water come down the ditch, didn't decide to irrigate      his own garden as well. Finally, you had to direct the      water once it got to the garden so that it didn't run      straight through the lettuce and drown it, missing the corn      altogether.    </p>    <p>      Lacking an orchard, we soon worked out a deal with our      neighbor down the road to irrigate her orchard in return      for as much fruit as we could pick. Anne's orchard was      substantial: peaches, sweet and sour cherries, three kinds      of plums, four kinds of apples, apricots, and pears. With      one-and-a-half water rights, she was entitled to a lot of      water, and it took us an entire day each week to manage it      (or attempt to manage it, I should say). Every Monday was a      battle with the gophers. We would open up the first      compuerta (head gate), and then watch the water disappear      down a gopher hole before it ever touched a tree. No sooner      did we plug that hole than the water disappeared down a      second, thwarting us again. After spending all morning      chasing the water around in order to find and fill gopher      holes, we'd sit back and rest, only to find a whole row of      pears completely bereft of water. Then we would begin      again. It was still a good trade, however, judging by the      amount of fruit we ate-dried, canned, and frozen.    </p>    <p>      All of our bartering skills lead to the granddaddy of all      trades-the birth of our son<br />      Jakob.    </p>        <p>      We also used bartering to build a new house. After a few      years, our 100-year-old rented adobe began to lose its      initial charm. Three major roof repairs, a blocked septic      tank, and constant dirt drifting down from the ceiling      (flat-roofed adobe houses are often covered with two feet      of dirt between the ceiling and the tarred roof, acting as      insulation) convinced us it was time to build our own house      and put to use all the building skills we had acquired.      Placitas is an original Spanish land grant, and most of the      land in the village is part of the San Antonio de Las      Huertas grant, not for sale. Although our landlord, an      Anglo from Albuquerque, owned a beautiful piece of land      adjacent to the house, he refused to sell it. We finally      settled on five acres, a mile from the village, located off      a forest access road leading into the Sandia Mountains. A      few other families had already built there, and water and      electricity were available if you could pay the price to      sink a well and extend the underground wire.      (Unfortunately, electric companies and well diggers aren't      all that interested in barter.)    </p>    <p>      Once we found the money to pay them, though, it was time      for some real trading, which meant working on all our      friends' houses while they helped us on ours. This included      filing cement block, laying adobes, installing window      frames, running wire, fitting pipes, cutting vigas (wooden      beams that support the ceiling), pouring bond beams,      plastering, laying brick floors, and installing wood      stoves. Our friend Tom proved invaluable. He and his family      lived in a valley above the village where they worked      constantly on their dome, a dwelling built of colorful      junked car-tops, always in need of repair. I think we      actually paid Tom wages for a while, but for the most part      we traded labor, adobe for adobe (he was building an adobe      addition to the dome), nail for nail. When we got to the      bond beam, the layer of cement that sits on top of the      adobe walls to hold the roof beams, we recruited several      other home builders to haul the buckets of cement up our      walls, as we would theirs.    </p>    <p>      You can buy vigas at wood yards in town, or you can do      things the hard way and cut them down yourself. We did it      the hard way, but we bartered for the person to run the      chain saw and fell the trees exactly where she called it on      the forest floor. My friend Jackie, an ornery, independent      woman who learned her timbering skills working for the      Forest Service and on her own 30 acres, cut us 40 vigas (20      for us, 20 for Tom) in two exhausting, all-day trips to the      cutting site on the far side of the mountains. In return,      Mark and I spent two weekends helping her tear down a      mountain cabin she had bid on (its 99-year forest lease had      expired) for material for the house she was building. She      even gave us half of the oak flooring as a bonus.    </p>    <p>      The acquisition of all these house-building skills was      leading up to the granddaddy of all trades-the birth      of our number one son. We really didn't need a complication      of that magnitude in the midst of building a house, but I      wasn't getting any younger. Having a kid also meant I      couldn't work as much on the house and for a living (I      worked as a seasonal employee of the Forest Service as fire      lookout and patrol), but common-sense considerations such      as these don't necessarily stop anyone from having babies.      I hooked up with a maternity center, where midwives      supervised my prenatal care, and where I planned to have      the baby when the time came. Fortunately, one of the      doctors who supported the maternity center by being on call      for hospital deliveries was a friend of ours. I'd gone to      college with his wife, and Mark and I used to baby-sit      their kids at their house in Albuquerque. When I ended up      in the hospital with a Cesarean section, my doctor friend,      who'd already been up all night with other screaming      mothers, accepted repairs on his house for the safe      delivery of our son, Jakob. I only wish the hospital had      been so kind.    </p>    <p>      We eventually moved into our house in Placitas and found      the time to acquire additional skills for barter. Jackie,      my tree-felling friend, had been leading hikes in the      Sandia Mountains for the continuing education program at      the local university. When her full-time job with the      Forest Service prevented her from offering the hikes      anymore, she turned them over to me. After a few years I      began teaching cross-country ski classes as well. I met all      kinds of people in my classes and bartered with them for      their services-massages from Rose, baby-sitting from      Carol (Max, our second son, had come along by then), and a      hernia operation for Mark (that was two year's worth of      hikes and ski trips with the doctor and his wife).    </p>    <p>      Over the years our bartering became even more diverse as      our lives increased in complexity. We started a      guide-book business, publishing books that I wrote      about hiking, backpacking, and cross-country skiing in New      Mexico. After I learned to typeset the books on the      computer, I bartered for the use of my neighbor's laser      printer with articles for her local newspaper. I got my      friend, Barbara, a talented graphic artist to design the      cover of one of my books for a huge philodendron plant that      had taken over our greenhouse. Mark began making sculpted      boxes based on traditional boxes that held figurines of      religious santos (or saints). Only instead of placing      saints inside, he made figurines of famous artists by      attaching photos of their faces to sculpted bodies. These      pieces were sold in galleries, and Mark traded Barbara his      Vincent Van Gogh box for a beautiful stained-glass      lampshade. He also traded his Tolstoy box to our      photographer friend    </p>    <p>      Alan for a print from his prestigious collection. To      complete our art collection, we traded for two lithographs      from Miki, several pastels, an oil from John, and drawings      from Jim. Other trades included a pair of metal-edged skis      for refinishing a dresser; an 11-day stay at a cabin in      southern Colorado for a built-in book cabinet; and      guide books for earrings.    </p>    <p>      In 1991, we even traded houses. Fed up with Placitas'      change from a small, rural community to an upper      middle-class suburb of Albuquerque, Mark and I decided it      was time to move farther north, where the type of life we      originally sought in Placitas still existed in more remote      Hispanic villages. In anticipation of that move, we traded      houses with a family who wanted to attend school in      Albuquerque, and whose house on a llano (flat ground above      a river) at the base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains      provided us with irrigated land and a community that still      grew its own food, cut its firewood, and was connected to a      sense of what was important. At the end of the trade, we      sold our house in Placitas (a heartbreaking, albeit      necessary experience) and moved to a small village not far      from the llano, where we continued to write books, make      boxes, grow a vegetable garden and a big field of garlic,      and best of all, barter.    </p>    <p>      Our neighbors immediately offered their time, products, and      hearts to usapricots for peas and squash, plums for milk      and eggs, friendship and trust for our commitment to their      way of life. We feel connected to our new home, and to the      people whose families have been here for hundreds of years.      Being a part of the way they live, being able to trade the      fruits of our labor for their generosity and kindness,      connects us to a life worth living. The intimacy that      barter brings, the attention to what you offer and what you      receive in return, makes life richer and more meaningful.      No matter how tied you are to today's complex market      economy, where money is often the measure of your worth,      you can always find something to trade.    </p>
