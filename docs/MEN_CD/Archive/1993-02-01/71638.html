                <p>      SPRING GARDEN    </p>        <p>      <strong>Get a jump on this season's garden harvest-      start your seeds the no-fail way.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Gail Damerow    </h5>        <p>      Growing plants from seed may seem a bit outmoded. After      all, started seedlings are readily available at every      nursery, as well as many grocery and department stores. But      growing vegetables from seed offers a number of advantages.      For one thing, you'll know exactly what you're growing.      Store-bought seedlings aren't always clearly identified.      For another, your bedding plants will be healthier. Many      Store-bought seedlings have weak, spindly stems and most of      them have gone through extended periods without water. And      then there's the matter of taste. Nearly all of the started      plants you'll find in stores are hybrids, the result of      deliberately crossing two or more plant varieties. Hybrids      are developed to solve the problems of large-scale food      production. They produce larger crops, they ripen all at      once for mechanical harvesting, and they have tough skins      that hold up well during long-distance shipping. Notice      that flavor is nowhere near the top of the list.    </p>    <p>      We gardeners, on the other hand, like fresh vegetables for      their tenderness and good flavor. We prefer extended      harvests that give us fresh produce over a long period of      time and that don't require marathon canning sessions. In      short, we prefer standard (non-hybrid) varieties. Standards      are rarely available as started plants, but instead must be      grown from seed.    </p>    <p>      When you start from seed, you have another advantage over      planting seedlings-you can sprout the seeds indoors      to get a jump on the season for an earlier harvest. If your      growing season is short, planting indoors buys time for      slow-growing varieties that otherwise may not mature before      fall's first frost-eggplant, peppers, and tomatoes      among vegetables; impatiens, petunias, and snapdragons      among flowers. And if your climate, like mine, goes too      quickly from frigid to sizzling, cool-weather Cole crops      (cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower) started indoors can be      handily harvested before the onset of summer heat.    </p>    <p>      Compared to seeds planted outdoors, those started indoors      have a better germination rate because they're pampered      more. You can enjoy greater variety by planting just a few      pots of several different things, then selecting only the      healthiest plants for transplanting. But the real reason we      die-hard gardeners like to start seeds indoors is that it      lets us get dirt under our fingernails long before the soil      is warm enough or dry enough to garden outdoors.    </p>        <h3>      Getting Started    </h3>    <p>      To start your own indoor nursery, here's what you'll need:    </p>    <p>      <em>Seeds.</em> Decide what you want to grow and purchase      the seeds in plenty of time. Mail-order houses offer the      widest variety of seeds, and will supply them when you want      them. (For tips on buying by mail, see "Mail-Order Mania"      in issue #135.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Containers.</em> Those of us who enjoy indoor planting      invariably set up in-house recycle centers tilled with milk      cartons, potato-chip tubes, juice cans, yogurt containers,      and anything else that's at least 3" deep. The best      planting containers are either tapered-like yogurt      containers-so plants can easily be slipped out, or      are made of paper-like milk cartons and juice cans-so      they can be torn open for plant removal. Flats (shallow      trays) may offer more planting space than individual pots,      but you're more likely to disturb tender roots at      transplant time.    </p>    <p>      To prepare containers for planting, wash them well, rinse      in warm water laced with a little chlorine bleach, and dry      them in the sun. With a nail, poke one or more small      drainage holes in the bottoms of all containers so you      won't drown your seedlings. If money is no object, save      yourself the bother of cleaning containers by buying pots      designed specifically for sprouting seeds. Seedlings      started in pots of pressed fiber or peat can be planted in      the garden, pot and all. Some seed -starting kits      come with their own planting mix.    </p>    <p>      <em>Planting mix.</em> Seeds sprout best in soil that      drains well, that doesn't easily compact, and that's free      of competing weed seeds, fungi, and other organisms that      can disease young plants. Sterile planting mixes, available      at any garden center, are relatively inexpensive. If you      buy a mix containing soil, be sure the label says it's been      sterilized.    </p>    <p>      Most mixes blended especially for germinating seeds contain      no soil at all, but are a mixture of sphagnum moss      (decomposed moss mined from swamps), perlite (a form of      volcanic ash), and vermiculite (mica expanded with heat,      like popcorn). This blend holds water well, but is      difficult to initially moisten. To dampen it sufficiently      for planting, put some into a plastic bag, add water, and      knead. Because this mixture is low in nutrients, you'll      have to fertilize seedlings from the time they achieve      three weeks' growth, using half the strength solution you'd      use for mature plants.    </p>    <p>      If you run out of planting mix at a crucial moment, or you      prefer not to spend money on someone else's mix, you can      make your own by combining equal parts sphagnum moss      (available from most garden centers), sifted compost, and      sifted garden soil. To eliminate soil-borne organisms that      cause plant problems, pasteurize the sifted soil and      compost by lightly moistening it and heating it in a      180°F oven for 45 minutes. Since cooking soil doesn't      exactly smell like freshbaked bread, place the mix in a      broiler bag (of the sort you'd use to cook a turkey) and      spread it on a shallow tray. Stir in the sphagnum moss and      cool well before planting.    </p>    <p>      <em>Labels.</em> Since newly sprouted plants look pretty      much alike, labels will help you keep track of what's what.      If something doesn't come up and needs replanting, you      won't have to guess what it was. You can buy bona fide      nursery labels, save up popsicle sticks, or make labels by      cutting a liquid bleach container into 1/2" vertical strips      and trimming a point at one end. Some planting containers      (like containers from yogurt, cottage cheese, and sour      cream) are easy to write on with an indelible marker,      eliminating the need for separate labels.    </p>    <p>      <em>Light.</em> Plants started in a window sill soon grow      leggy and topple over-perhaps because, at this time      of year, the sky stays cloudy for days on end. A light for      your seedlings therefore makes a good investment and can be      used year after year. You might enjoy the prestige (and      expense) of a specially designed "grow" light, but you'll      get the same good results with inexpensive fluorescent      tubes and a fixture from the local discount store.    </p>    <p>      Cool white ("daylight") 40-watt tubes throw even light of      the sort plants thrive on, and they don't get hot enough to      burn tender leaves. Select a fixture (or combination of      fixtures) that's the right size to cover all your pots,      placed directly below the light. Hang the fixture from      chains so that you can raise it as plants grow, keeping the      light about 1" above plant tops.    </p>    <p>      <em>Warmth.</em> Most seeds germinate best in a warm,      draft-free place. Where the temperature is a little      high, plants will grow fast and become leggy. Where the      temperature is a little low, plants will grow slowly and      have strong, sturdy stems; however, if the temperature is      too low, seeds won't germinate at all. If the area where      you plan to start your seeds is much cooler than 70° to      75°F, find a warm place such as the top of the water      heater or refrigerator. After the seeds germinate, place      the pots under the light.    </p>    <h3>      Planting    </h3>    <p>      Now all you need to know is the date of the last expected      frost in your area. If you aren't sure, call your county's      agricultural extension office. Start seeds for slow-growing      plants like cabbage, eggplant, head lettuce, peppers, and      tomatoes eight weeks before the last-frost date. Start      fast-growing plants like Chinese cabbage, cucumbers,      melons, pumpkins, and squash four weeks before the last      frost. You don't want fastgrowing plants to outgrow their      pots and get root-bound while you wait for your garden soil      to warm up or dry out enough for transplanting. As a      general rule, it's better to start seeds a little too late      than a little too early.    </p>    <p>      Fill each container with planting mix to within V," of the      top. Press the mix gently to firm it up without packing it      solid. In each container, arrange two large seeds (such as      cucumber, squash, or pumpkin) or three small seeds (such as      tomato or cabbage). If small seeds stick to your fingers      and are hard to place, pick them up with tweezers.    </p>    <p>      Cover large seeds with soil to no more than three times      their thickness. Press small seeds into the soil without      covering them, since otherwise they might get buried too      deeply to germinate. To avoid washing the planting mix away      from the seeds, water the pots with a spray bottle filled      with warm water. To keep the soil from drying out, lay a      piece of newspaper across the tops of the containers.    </p>    <p>      Water the pots daily, taking care to not let the soil get      too soggy or dry. Different seeds take different amounts of      time to germinate. The label on your seed packets should      tell you the germination times for the varieties you plant.      As soon as little green sprouts appear, remove the      newspaper and turn on the grow light. Turn the light off      each night to give plants a rest. Continue watering daily      so soil stays evenly moist.    </p>    <p>      When plants have four true leaves (not counting those first      nondescript round leaves all plants start out with), thin      plants to one per pot. Don't pull out the weak plants or      you'll disturb the roots of the remaining plant. Instead,      use scissors to snip off all but the strongest single plant      in each pot. Water a little less often from now on,      allowing the soil's surface to dry out between waterings.    </p>    <h3>      Transplanting    </h3>    <p>      Before your plants get big enough for the great outdoors,      they should be transplanted into larger pots at least once.      Transplant peppers and tomatoes twice. Any plant needs      transplanting if it outgrows its pot while you're waiting      for conditions outside to be right for the big move.      Putting plants in bigger pots stimulates root growth,      thanks to new soil with fresh nutrients and greater room      for roots to spread.    </p>    <p>      Whenever you transplant a seedling, make sure to thoroughly      water it first. Then run a butter knife around the edge of      the pot to loosen the root ball. Hold the pot in one hand      and tip it upsidedown onto your other hand, so the root      ball lands on your fingers and the plant falls between      them. (If you planted in fiber or peat pots, break away the      bottom so roots can get through, then replant the pot and      all.) Add enough planting mix to bury the stem up to the      first true leaves. Press the mix firmly around roots and      then water the plant once more. Transplants may droop but      should grow upright within a day or two.    </p>    <p>      When the time comes to move your plants outdoors, avoid an      abrupt move that will shock them and retard their growth.      Instead, let your plants gradually adjust to being outside      through a process called "hardening off." One week before      transplant time, place the seedlings outdoors in a shady      spot that's protected from any wind. If the nights are      still cool, bring the plants inside before the sun goes      down. Gradually move the plants until they're getting full      sun during the day. (Watch that the sun or wind doesn't dry      them out-you may have to water more often than you      have been.)    </p>    <p>      Cool-weather varieties such as sole crops may be moved to      the garden as soon as the soil can be worked and the danger      of heavy frost is over. Warm-weather plants like tomatoes      shouldn't go out until all danger of frost has past.    </p>    <h3>      Saving Seeds    </h3>    <p>      If you have seeds left over, they will keep for at least a      year. Some can be stored for up to five years, provided you      keep them in airtight containers in a cool, dry place.    </p>    <p>      You might even save seeds from plants you grow yourself,      provided that they're standards rather than hybrids.      Hybrids cannot be grown from seeds you gather yourself, but      must be purchased year after year (another reason      commercial growers favor them). If you harvest seeds from a      hybrid, they will not grow true to the parent plant.      Instead, they'll likely either be sterile or will revert to      one or another of the plants in their background.    </p>    <p>      Standard varieties grow true to type as long as they have      not inadvertently been crossed with related plants growing      nearby. Saving your own seeds gives you a certain sense of      satisfaction, as well as a modicum of self-sufficiency. It      also helps preserve old-time varieties. Of the vegetables      cataloged by the USDA in 1902, only 3% still exist today.      The rest have been replaced by hybrids.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note: Every year at this time, Gail Damerow converts he      r sewing morn into a snug seedling nursery.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Additional Reading:    </h3>    <p>      <em>The New Seed-Starter's Handbook,</em> by Nancy Bubel      ($14.95, Rodale Press, 33 East Minor Street, Emmaus, PA      18098): a how-to guide to starting vegetables, fruits,      flowers, herbs, trees, and shrubs from seed.    </p>    <p>      <em>Garden Seed Inventory,</em> by Ken Whealy ($22      postpaid, Seed Saver Publications, Route 3 Box 239,      Decorah, IA 52101): inventory of seed catalogs listing      nonhybrid vegetable seeds available in the United States      and Canada.    </p>    <p>      <em>Saving Seeds,</em> by Marc Rogers ($12.70 postpaid,      Storey Publishing, 800/4415700): gardener's guide to      growing and storing vegetable and-flower seeds.    </p>    <p>      <em>Seed to Seed,</em> by Suzanne Ashworth ($20 postpaid,      Seed Saver Publications, Route 3 Box 239, Decorah, IA      52101): seed saving techniques for the vegetable gardener.    </p>    <h3>      PROTECTING TRANSPLANTS    </h3>    <p>      The best time to move seedlings to the garden is on a warm,      windless, cloudy day when light showers are predicted.      Unfortunately, the weather doesn't always cooperate. Chilly      nights, not to mention the drying effects of wind and sun,      can quickly wipe out all those little plants you tended so      carefully.    </p>    <p>      Garden centers carry protective devices, called "hotcaps,"      of every shape, size, and especially price. To save money,      you can protect seedlings with large mills cartons,      inverted cans, or anything else big enough not to touch a      plant's leaves. Hotcaps hold in heat during the night, but      in sunny weather they must be removed during the day so      they won't collect the sun's heat, cooking new transplants.    </p>    <p>      If you've got lots of little plants, setting out hotcaps      each evening and gathering them up each morning gets to be      a hassle. And while the hotcaps are off, seedlings have no      protection from wind and unrelenting sun. Pondering these      problems, my husband and I hit on the idea of fashioning      plant protectors from white plastic trash-bag liners. We      slit the bottoms open and cut each 20" by 28.5" liner into      three 20" x 9.5" strips. We used our food-pouch heat sealer      to form tubular pockets along the two folds. Into the      tubular pockets we slipped two slender stakes, which we      poked into the ground as an anchor.    </p>    <p>      We used a third stake to pull the plastic out into a right      angle corner, creating a protector with two walls oriented      to shield a plant from both sun and wind. In seasons when      the wind whipped around from several directions, we opened      up the plastic and added a fourth stake to create a box      with four walls. 'these plastic protectors could be reused      several times in one season, but they don't hold up well      enough to be stored for future seasons. To us, that seemed      a tad wasteful.    </p>    <p>      So we looked around for something that could be saved year-      after year and discovered fiberglass sheeting, a recycled      product left over from the manufacture of paper and used to      shield gamebirds from wind. The fiberglass comes in rolls      of various widths-the 2' roll turned out to be ideal      for protecting plants.    </p>    <p>      Using scissors, we cut the fiberglass into 1' strips,      fashioned each strip into a 1' high tube stapled to two      wooden stakes. When the stakes are pushed into the ground      on either side of a plant, the tube surrounds the plant and      protects it from all directions. The white fiberglass does      not collect and hold excess heat, and is porous enough to      allow air movement but not drafts.    </p>    <p>      Fiberglass is durable and does not rot or rip. The      protectors can easily be threaded onto a length of rope and      hung from the rafters of a storage shed. A 2' wide roll      containing 100 feet costs $30, but you can buy only as much      as you need. Fiberglass sheeting is available from Len      Leberg, Thunderbird Game Farm, Box 23119, Thunderbird Rd.,      Chilton, WI 53014 (414/853-3030).    </p>    <p>      Both the one-season plastic protectors and the more durable      fiberglass kind will keep plants warm throughout the night      unless unseasonable frost threatens. In that case, slip a      paper bag over each protector late in the afternoon, before      the sun goes down. In blowing wind, put a small stone or      dirt clot on each bag to keep it from blowing away. Avoid      trapping excess heat by removing bags in morning soon after      the sun comes up.    </p>
