                <p>      NATURAL HEALTH    </p>        <p>      Granted it's messy, but cooking with kids promotes a whole      new set of skills-the fun way.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      I know what you're thinking. You are envisioning yourself      knee deep in an avalanche of flour. The mixer is buzzing at      top speed, splattering the wallpaper with brownie batter.      Your children are fencing with shish kebab skewers and the      cat and dog are fighting over food remains. As the      paramedics carry you out the door, you imagine the      headlines in the local paper, "Woman Collapses After      Cooking with Children."    </p>    <p>      Sure, cooking with your children is a messier and more      time-consuming project than cooking solo; it's definitely      not something to undertake when you're tired and pressed      for time. You don't need to scrounge through women's      magazines, however, in order to have a vast array of cutesy      children's recipes. These are often time consuming and very      rarely nutritious.    </p>    <p>      Your preschooler will have just as much fun tearing up      lettuce, chopping up fruit with a plastic knife, or sifting      flour. When my son was about two years old, I figured it      was about time to begin improving his culinary awareness      skills. (After all, the world needs no more untrained men      in the kitchen.) These days, everyone needs to know their      way around the kitchen for survival purposes-the days of      June and Ward Cleaver are over.    </p>    <p>      There are other valid reasons, of course, for inviting the      kids into the kitchen. I know you think I'm going to say      that it's one of those special parent-child bonding      experiences. Of course it can be, but food preparation      skills are also a springboard for learning. Cooking with      your children will promote development in the following      areas:    </p>        <h3>      Self Esteem    </h3>    <p>      <em>Cooking encourages your child's independence and      autonomy. Children are often proud of their kitchen      creations, and will often boast, "Taste it! I made it all      by myself." Also, here's the perfect opportunity for your      child to try a new vegetable or food that is strongly      disliked. Being rather egocentric, young children will      generally eat what they've prepared. Salads can take on a      whole new meaning for children when they prepare it      themselves. Also, learning about food will help children      make healthier food choices.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Language    </h3>    <p>      <em>You can expand your child's vocabulary by incorporating      new words into your food preparation: saute, fold, mince,      blend, and so on. Your child will learn how to do the      activities by doing them. Have older children read and      follow recipes, step by step, in order to learn sequencing      and how to recall information. Later, you can ask your      child to explain to you how "we made jello today."</em>    </p>    <h3>      Cognitive Skills    </h3>    <p>      <em>Cooking can be scientific because of experimentation      involved and the theory of cause and effect. Discuss with      your child how a liquid turns into a solid when you're      making ice cream or popsicles. Help him discriminate      between two smells, such as cinnamon and almond extract.      Make predictions, asking your child questions such as,      "What do you think would happen if we forgot to put in the      baking powder?" or "What would have happened if we had      doubled the amount of yeast in the bread?"</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Work on pre-math skills, such as sequencing by nesting      measuring cups inside one another or arranging measuring      spoons by size. Sorting objects is also a pre-math skill.      Ask your pre-schooler to sort food items; putting chocolate      chips in one pile, raisins in another, nuts in another,      etc., pointing out both their similarities and      differences.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Large and Fine Motor Skills    </h3>    <p>      <em>Whenever children are cutting, rolling, stirring,      pounding, chopping, and peeling, they are manipulating and      strengthening muscles in their arms, hands, and fingers.      Holding utensils, measuring ingredients, and pouring      liquids helps develop coordination and dexterity. Before      you round up all your kids and head for the kitchen, here      are a few hints to make the experience as pleasurable as      possible:</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Make a cooking appointment with only one child at a      time. (If you have more than one child, rotate. You might      want to call the others in to play with the playdough or      decorate cookies after the food preparation with the one      child.)</em> <em>Set up a special time with your child when      there are few distractions, such as when older children are      at school or the baby is napping. Be sure to allow enough      time. He/she may want to sift the flour for 30 minutes just      for fun.</em> <em>Have all the prep work done beforehand:      clear all surfaces and have everything you need available      so that your child won't become restless and bored.</em>      <em>Keep the recipes simple at first. Young children are      happy merely making cookiecutter sandwiches for lunch.</em>      <em>Allow your child to be creative. There isn't always one      correct way to prepare food. (For instance, my son puts      cajun seasoning in his own marinara sauce.)</em> <em>Don't      be afraid to fail. Children need to learn that life doesn't      always flow as planned. Discuss with your child ways to      improve your recipe the next time that you make it.</em>      <em>Schedule a regular time for your children to help you      in the kitchen. Post jobs on a bulletin board. Even a three      year old can set the table and learn one-to-one      correspondence.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Soft Pretzels    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon yeast (I use powdered)</em> <em>1 cup warm      water</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon honey</em> <em>3/4 cup whole      wheat flour (not pastry flour) plus 3/4 % cup unbleached      white flour.</em> <em>1 egg</em> <em>sesame seeds</em>      <em>optional: 1/3 cup cheddar cheese, grated<br />      <strong>Utensils:</strong></em> <em>large mixing bowl, two      medium bowls, measuring cups and spoons</em> <em>cheese      grater cookie sheet</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Preheat oven to 425°F. Start yeast according to      package directions. Then mix yeast, honey, and water; wait      for five to 10 minutes until mixture gets foamy. While      waiting, grate cheddar cheese.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Next, mix unsifted flour and yeast mixture together, a      little at a time. Keep adding more of each and mixing,      until dough is smooth and can be easily stretched. (This      takes about five to 10 minutes.) Mix in cheese, and then      make six to eight balls out of dough. Add more white flour      if dough is too sticky to work with, and roll each ball      into a long "snake." Shape the "snake" into letters,      numbers, or any shape that your child comes up with. Beat      egg, and brush it onto the dough shapes. Sprinkle sesame      seeds onto formed pretzels, and bake on a greased (or      non-stick) cookie sheet for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove when      light brown.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Pita Pizza    </h3>    <p>      <em>vegetables, any combination: broccoli, green or red      pepper, zucchini, onions, carrots, spinach</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pita bread, we use 3" whole-wheat pitas</em> <em>1      small can pizza sauce (eight ounces)</em> <em>1/4 pound      cheese, grated or sliced thin: provolone, muenster,      cheddar</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Preheat oven to 375°F. Steam vegetables for about      60 seconds. While they're steaming, lightly toast pitas in      toaster until they dry out a bit. Spread sauce on pitas,      sprinkle on cheese, and decorate with vegetables. Place      pizzas on cookie sheet and bake for about 10 minutes until      crispy.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Fruit Juice Jello    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 cups 100 percent juice (appleraspberry or apple-grape      is good)</em> <em>1 package Knox unflavored      gelatin</em><br />      <em>*fresh fruit (bananas, apples, grapes, oranges,      berries)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Bring to a boil one cup of juice. Add gelatin      gradually, whisking constantly. Stir into bowl with the      other cup of juice and fruit. Add fruit and chill until      firm.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>*Do not use pineapple or kiwi-the jello won't gel.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Edible Playdough* (or call it fudge)    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 cup carob powder</em> <em>1/2 cup honey</em> <em>1      cup peanut butter (smooth)</em> <em>1 cup powdered      milk</em> <em>3/4 teaspoon almond extract</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Mix together ingredients with hands or wooden spoon. If      too sticky, add more powdered milk. Give your children a      two-inch ball to handle like playdough. After creating and      experimenting with different shapes, they can decorate      their fudge with coconut, raisins, and nuts such as sliced      almonds, etc.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>*This "fudge" may not look all that appetizing, but if      you don't react negatively, your child won't even      notice.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Surprise Muffins    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 egg</em> <em>1/4 cup oil</em> <em>1/4 cup honey</em>      <em>1 tablespoon lemon juice</em> <em>1 cup milk</em>      <em>1/4 cup oat bran (or wheat germ)</em> <em>2 cups whole      wheat pastry flour, sifted</em> <em>1 1/2 teaspoons baking      powder</em><br />      <em>*1/3 cup sugar free jam or jelly</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Preheat oven to 3750 F. Line a muffin pan with 12 paper      liners. Beat egg, honey, lemon juice, milk, and oat bran      together. Add flour and baking powder; mix briefly. Fill      muffin cups half full. Then have your child place a      teaspoon of jam in the middle of each one. Don't take long,      though-the baking powder is working. Spoon the rest of      batter on top until cups are at least X full. Bake for 20      minutes until light brown.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>*The "surprise" can also be carob chips,      raisins-whatever you think of.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Fruit Kebobs    </h3>    <p>      <em>party toothpicks</em> <em>fresh fruit: pineapple,      grapes, kiwis, bananas, oranges</em> <em>shredded coconut      (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Slice fruit in bite sized pieces, place them on      toothpicks, and sprinkle with flakes of coconut. This      recipe may seem a bit simple, but kids just love to play      with the different fruit shapes and color      combinations.</em>    </p>
