        Renewable energy enthusiasts often find their good intentionsthwarted by the high cost of solar and wind power systems. Butthese clean, self-sufficient energy sources are more feasible thanit may appear at first glance. State and federal energy incentives,including rebates, tax credits and net-metering, can help youinstall a renewable energy system and still stay within yourbudget. Paired with an<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/2006-10-01/Green-Gazette-Making-Energy-Upgrades-Affordable.aspx" target="_blank">Energy Efficient Mortgage</a> (EEM) ? created to   help homeowners either make energy upgrades to an existing home   or purchase an energy-efficient home ? they can make renewable   energy much more affordable.<br /><br />While such incentives are exciting, ever-changing legislation andprograms that vary by state can make understanding them confusing ?which makes groups such as <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/" target="_blank">Energy Star</a>, the<a href="http://www.energy.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department ofEnergy</a> and the <a href="http://dsireusa.org/" target="_blank">Database of State Incentives for Renewables andEfficiency</a> invaluable resources. Both Energy Star and the DOEoffer information on EEMs on their Web sites, and the IncentivesDatabase is the go-to site for information on state-by-staterenewable energy incentives, as well as a number of federalprograms, both for individuals and corporations.<br /><br />The Incentives Database provides information on grants, taxcredits, rebates, leasing information, loan programs and much more? basically everything you and/or your tax advisor would need toclaim the incentive. And in case any of the terms are unfamiliar,they've included a handy glossary.<br /><br />You can find more news about renewable energy incentives and DIYrenewable energy projects at<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></a>.And you can view photos of solar homes from the National Solar Tour<a href="http://cu.motherearthnews.com/pages/event_galleries.php?event=14" target="_blank">here</a>, and see how people like you have put renewable energysystems into their homes.<br /><br />Have you taken advantage of renewable energy incentives?
