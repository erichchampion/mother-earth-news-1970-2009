        Despite its neutral (some would say delicious) flavor and docile,decidedly uncontroversial original source, milk has, in recentyears, become a divisive subject. Doctors, organic farmers andindustry officials engage in heated debates about whether Americansreally need to drink milk at all, and, if so,<a href="https://www.motherearthnews.com/Whole-Foods-and-Cooking/2005-12-01/Reconsidering-Calcium.aspx" target="_blank">how much</a> and what kind of milk is   healthiest.<br /><br />Many of today's dairy cows are injected with a geneticallyengineered growth hormone known as<a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/rbgh_hormo.cfm" target="_blank">rBGH</a> (recombinant bovine growth hormone).Organic farmers and other skeptics assert that this milk poseshealth risks to humans. Among the purported possible side effects:an increased chance of colon, prostate and breast cancer.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/issues/rbgh/" target="_blank">developers</a> of the hormone disagree, statingthat milk from cows injected with artificial hormones is nodifferent than milk from untreated animals. The FDA approved rBGHin 1993, though it is banned in both Canada and the EuropeanUnion.<br /><br />The hormone is used to make cows more productive; rBGH increasesproduction unnaturally by as much as 10-15%. This strain on thecows often leads to udder infection.<br /><br />If you're nervous about purchasing milk from hormone-injected cows,here are other options:<br /><br /><b>Buy local or regional milk</b><br />The easiest way to know the content of your milk is to get it froma nearby farm where you can ask the producers how they raise theircows. A simple way to do this is through an independent grocer orcooperative ? find organic farms, restaurants, and stores near youat <a href="http://www.eatwellguide.org" target="_blank">www.eatwellguide.org</a> and<a href="http://www.localharvest.org" target="_blank">www.localharvest.org</a>. As an added bonus, localmilk usually tastes better because it hasn't beenultra-pasteurized.<a href="http://www.idfa.org/facts/milk/pasteur.cfm" target="_blank">Ultra-pasteurization</a> heats milk to a muchhigher temperature than pasteurization alone, and as a result canbe stored for weeks longer. The consequence, however, is a productthat is notably less tasty.<br /><br />Of course, for a really fun time, you could<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Homesteading-and-Self-Reliance/1981-07-01/Ten-Commandments-for-Raising-A-Backyard-Dairy-Cow-Part-I.aspx" target="_blank">raise your own dairy cow</a>.<br /><br /><b>Stick to organic milk</b><br />Choose organic milk and you'll avoid added hormones andantibiotics. In addition, you can relax knowing that the cows havebeen given a diet entirely free from animal byproducts. Be sure tolook for the green and white certified USDA organic label. Onegreat option is the brand<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Whole-Foods-and-Cooking/2006-02-01/Organic-Valley-Farmer-Cooperative.aspx" target="_blank">Organic Valley</a>, a farmer owned co-op of over   1,100 family-owned farms.<br /><br /><b>Give the cows a break</b><br />Sheep and<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Livestock-and-Farming/2002-06-01/Want-Milk-Get-Goats.aspx" target="_blank">goats</a> make milk, too, and they are often   easier for lactose-intolerant individuals to digest. At the very   least, try goat cheese before you shun the milk of non-mooing   animals.<br /><br /><b>Try plant-based milks</b><br />Soy, almond and rice milks are lactose-free alternatives perfectfor people avoiding milk. They are available in a number ofvarieties and flavors, but, as always, you should remain aware ofthe energy cost and practice behind the product you choose. Makesure to buy organic plant-based milk to avoid drinking geneticallyengineered milk. The organic standards prohibit the use of GMOs(genetically modified organisms).<br /><br />Have you found your perfect milk source? Do you think soy is thesolution?
