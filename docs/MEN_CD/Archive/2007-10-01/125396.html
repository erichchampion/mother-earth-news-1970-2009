        <p>Homesteading and self-sufficient living are easier than ever,thanks to a wide range of modern low-tech tools and techniques.While our ancestors cut sod to build their house, today's modernhomesteaders look for the best energy-efficient building materials.Pioneers used buckets to haul water from the creek, but nowhomeowners can choose solar irrigation pumps or rainwater catchmentsystems to irrigate their gardens and yards.</p><br /><p>You don't have to live on 40 acres to experience the joy andsatisfaction of self-reliance and working with your hands, whetherit's growing food, raising chickens or undertaking DIY projects.Whether you are a city, suburban or rural 'homesteader,' there arestill some basic skills and techniques, ones your greatgrandparents would have practiced, that will make your sustainableliving experience successful and enjoyable. Here are some of ourtop recommendations for books to inform and inspire you.</p><br /><p>The most informative books on all things related to modernhomesteading are Carla Emery's <em>The Encyclopedia of CountryLiving</em> and <em>The Self-sufficient Life and How to LiveIt</em> by John Seymour.</p><br /><p>Choose any homesteading question and Carla Emery's <em>TheEncyclopedia of Country Living</em> will almost always provide youranswer. What sets this homesteading bible apart from otherhomesteading books are the stories of Emery's personal successes,failures, joys and sorrows as she wrote the book while raising afamily on her Idaho farm.</p><br /><p>Our other favorite comprehensive homesteading book is <em>TheSelf-Sufficient Life and How to Live It</em>. First published inthe United Kingdom in 1975, the updated version is filled withmarvelous illustrations and drawings that give you step-by-stepinstructions on making butter, brewing rose hip wine, sharpening ascythe, building a fence, shearing a sheep, laying out a garden andmuch, much more.</p><br /><p>There also are many books that each focus on individualhomesteading topics.</p><br /><p>If 'putting up' the produce from your garden is a priority,check out <em>Keeping the Harvest</em>. This book details how topreserve fruits and vegetables by canning, freezing, pickling,drying, curing and using cold storage.</p><br /><p><em>The Woodburner's Companion</em> offers the pros and cons ofheating with wood using woodstoves, fireplaces, wood furnaces andboilers, masonry heaters and pellet stoves. It includes advice oninstalling stoves, troubleshooting chimney problems and how tostore firewood.</p><br /><p>If you're planning to design your own water or septic system,read <em>Wells and Septic Systems</em>. You will learn where yourwater supply comes from, how to find it and the best way to get itto the surface. The section on septic tanks explains how to build atank, lay the leach fields and connect the system to yourhouse.</p><br /><p>For inspiration, read the experiences of otherback-to-the-landers, such as the 20th century homesteaders Helenand Scott Nearing. We highly recommend their classic book, <em>TheGood Life</em>,which documents their homesteading experiences inVermont and Maine, where they built their own stone houses and grewalmost all of their own food.</p><br /><p>To find books that compliment whatever stage of modernhomesteading you are in, spend some time at your library or perusethe offerings at<a href="https://www.motherearthshopping.com/order/order.aspx?PromoCode=MMEEN7A3&utm_source=MEL&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=MMEEN7A3" target="_blank">Mother Earth Shopping</a>.
