        <h5 id="byline">By Bob Brackett</h5><p>If you're searching for a quick way to scour out an encrusted section of stovepipe - <em>without</em> purchasing an expensive flue-cleaning kit - look no further than your trash barrel. A discarded metal can that's slightly smaller than your pipe will make an excellent scraper, after a couple of simple modifications. First, trim the lip off the already opened end of the container with a pair of snips ... to produce a sharp, creosote-cleaning edge. Then form a handle from the bottom of the can by making two 120Â° cuts - directly opposite each other - with a can opener, and folding the metal under to provide a bridge, with rounded edges, that you can grasp. To put the makeshift "sweep" to work, just push it into the fouled pipe - cutting end first - and work the device through the tube by twisting it back and forth. Great gobs of creosote will fall into the bucket that you've cleverly (I hope!) placed below.</p>
