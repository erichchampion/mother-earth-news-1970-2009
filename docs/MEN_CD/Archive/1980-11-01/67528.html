                    <h5 id="byline">     By Tom and Carole Hodges</h5>      <p>      Warm up your winter meals<br /> with hot and hearty . . .    </p>        <p>      There are - as most regular readers of this      publication know - any number of ways to cut down on      fuel consumption during these chilly winter days. And one      of the most <em>pleasurable</em> conservation techniques      involves stoking up the of <em>internal</em> furnace ...      with hearty cold-weather meals.    </p>    <p>      Our easy-to-follow recipe - which produces a fiery      "stomach fuel" that's sure to appeal to <em>anyone</em> who      savors spicy Mexican cuisine - can be made fresh for      immediate consumption . . . and is <em>also</em> suitable      for canning or freezing.    </p>    <p>      We grow our own Anaheim chilies and jalapeños to use      in preparing this relish, but most any type of hot pepper      will do. (Remember that different varieties of the spicy      fruit will produce varied degrees of "hotness" . . . your      personal taste preference will determine which peppers      - "wild" or mild - you'll want to use.) The      only other required ingredients are ripe tomatoes, onions,      garlic, and salt. (You can, of course, use your own canned      or frozen produce to whip up a batch of the chili condiment      now that the growing season is over.)    </p>    <p>      Before we give you a <em>specific</em> "formula", however,      we'd like to warn you that we've never followed a      <em>written</em> recipe. Because every batch will turn out      slightly different, be sure to taste the sauce often as      it's being prepared . . . and feel free to add whatever      ingredients <em>you</em> think are necessary.    </p>    <p>      The first thing you'll want to do is peel about 6 to 8      chilies or jalapeños (be sure to wear rubber      gloves). This is best done by roasting the spicy fruits      over a low flame ( <em>or</em> under a broiler) and turning      them often . . . until most of the skin becomes brown and      is loose. (They should be blistered but not burned black.)      Then, plunge the chilies into <em>cold</em> water, and the      skins will peel off with little effort. Remove and discard      the stems as well. (The seeds - which are usually      <em>quite</em> hot - can be removed or left in,      according to your taste preference.)    </p>    <p>      Now blend or chop the peppers together with 1 onion, 4 ripe      tomatoes, and a clove of garlic (you can substitute 1/2      teaspoon of garlic powder if you wish), before adding 2      teaspoons of salt to the mixture.    </p>    <p>      Remember that the <em>amount</em> of each ingredient may be      altered according to your taste. Just add more chili      peppers to obtain a fiery, greener relish . . . or use      additional ripe tomatoes if you prefer a milder, redder      sauce.    </p>    <p>      If you like the taste of raw onion, you can serve the      "macho" uncooked . . . otherwise simply <em>simmer</em> it,      over <em>low</em> heat, until it reaches the texture you      prefer.    </p>    <p>      In the summer, when fresh garden ingredients are plentiful,      we put up large amounts of chili macho. Simply chop the      produce (using a blender will make the job easy), and place      it in a large pot with a few tablespoons of vinegar, honey,      and salt . . . then cook the mixture over low heat for      about an hour. Pour the spicy brew into sterile jars and      process to seal.    </p>    <p>      You'll find chili macho to be a <em>versatile</em>      condiment. It's delicious poured over pinto beans or rice,      used as a sauce on tacos and enchiladas, or added to stews.      All alone, it makes a tasty dip for crispy fried tortilla      chips. And - on a cold winter morning - you can      add the "liquid fire" to fried eggs for a really      <em>warming</em> breakfast!    </p>
