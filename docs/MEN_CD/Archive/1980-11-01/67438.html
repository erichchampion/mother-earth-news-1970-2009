                <p>      <strong>Mother takes a new look at an old food . . . and      finds a healthful, easy-to-prepare winter      dinner:</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Carole Charles    </h5>        <p>      Most of us can remember lying abed with the midwinter      snuffles - likely as a result of one too many days of      running around in a soaking wet snowsuit and slush-filled      galoshes - and being served a diet that seemed to      consist of little more than slightly stale water and milk      toast.    </p>    <p>      Now in those circumstances, such a dish (which, more often      than not, consisted of plain white bread drenched with      lukewarm milk) was rarely seen as a treat. However, I've      discovered how to make a special milk toast that's not only      a big hit with every member of the family, but a real snap      to prepare, as well. In fact, once I've baked the bread (a      chore that would have to be done in any case), even my      youngest diners can make <em>their</em> own tasty meals.      It's no wonder, then, that I've established a tradition of      "Sunday milk toast supper" around our house!    </p>    <p>      <strong>IT ALL BEGINS WITH BREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Of course, <em>before</em> I can sit back and watch my      family prepare the hassle-free dinners once a week, I have      to contribute <em>my</em> share . . . which I do in the      course of my regular weekly baking-day chores. I've      developed a recipe that turns out delicious loaves . . .      which are great for day-to-day bread-eating and      <em>especially</em> tasty when served as milk toast.    </p>    <p>      To begin, measure 3 cups of oatmeal, 1/2 cup of bran, 3      teaspoons of sea salt, 2 tablespoons of oil (or butter),      and 1 cup of raisins (the last ingredient is optional) into      a big bowl. Pour 3 cups of boiling water over the dry mix,      stir it up, and set it aside till it's lukewarm.    </p>    <p>      While you're waiting, pour 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of      molasses into a smaller bowl . . . add 1 cup of warm water      ... and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of dry yeast over the      liquid. Let this bowl stand, too, until the yeast bubbles      and the oatmeal mixture (in the <em>other</em> container)      has cooled.    </p>    <p>      Now, pour the yeast mix into the oatmeal bowl, stir well,      and keep adding flour (I use about 5 cups of stone-ground      whole wheat flour and 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour,      plus as much unbleached white flour as necessary) until      you've produced a kneadable dough.    </p>    <p>      Once the bread-to-be has been kneaded, put it in an oiled      bowl . . . cover it with a warm, slightly damp towel . . .      and let it rise until the dough doubles. At that point,      punch the aromatic mass down, shape it into three loaves,      and place them in oiled bread pans.    </p>        <p>      After the dough has risen to the top of the containers,      slide the pans into a cold oven, set the temperature      control at 350 Â°F, and let the bread bake for about 50      minutes . . . until the loaves are a light bronze. Then      turn them out of the tins and-when they're completely      cool-wrap and store them (you can even freeze some .      . . if you don't devour the whole batch first!).    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE TOAST WITH THE MOST</strong>    </p>    <p>      And just how do you transform that delicious bread into      (equally) delicious milk toast? Well, simply warm milk      - at a low heat, being sure that it doesn't boil      - in a heavy pan. (Better yet, have someone else do      it. After all, you've done your share of the work already!)      Then toast a slice of the hearty loaf - make it a      good thick one! - butter it, and place it in a bowl.      Sprinkle the bread with cinnamon, drizzle a little honey      over it, and then pour in a generous ladleful of hot milk.    </p>    <p>      I can't imagine a better way to begin a relaxing winter      evening!    </p>
