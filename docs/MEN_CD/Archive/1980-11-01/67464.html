                <p>      In MOTHER NO. 64, Plowboy Interview subject John Holt      talked at length about the whys and hows of educating your      children and the advantages of <em>not</em> allowing them      to go through our country's conventional school system.      Well, the author of the following piece not only      homeschooled several of her children. . . <em>she</em> was      also educated - as a young child - by      <em>her</em> mother!    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Diana Avery Amsden</h5>        <p>      Can you provide your child with a better education than he      or she could expect to receive in the public schools?    </p>    <p>      That question is, of course, quite difficult to answer.      After all, most people have been helped and inspired by      exceptional teachers. On the other hand, it's pretty much      common knowledge that <em>many</em> public school educators      are incompetent. Worse yet, the overall <em>atmosphere</em>      of our learning institutions often makes it all but      impossible for a student to receive a good education. (in      some instances, both pupils and instructors can do little      more than worry about their <em>physical safety</em> !)    </p>    <p>      All in all, though, before you can decide whether you'll be      able to teach your child better than the established      schools can, you'll have to assess both your      <em>abilities</em> (and commitments) and the quality of      your local educational institutions. One thing's for sure:      It is certainly possible for parents to provide a good      - indeed, excellent - education for their own      children. I know this to be true from my own personal      experience . . . because not only was <em>I</em> taught at      home as a child, but I later educated four of my own      offspring during their early childhood years. And I feel      that the results, in <em>both</em> cases, were quite      rewarding.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MY DAYS AS A</strong> <strong>HOME-TAUGHT      STUDENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      My mother - Winifred Stahly Amsden - never      earned a college degree . . . but she is nonetheless an      unusually literate, well-read, and businesslike woman. She      started my education when I was four . . . with the help of      the correspondence kindergarten course provided by the      Calvert School, Dept. TMEN, Tuscany Road, Baltimore,      Maryland 21210. (Even today, it pleases me to remember the      Calvert-supplied bright wooden beads and the variously      shaped blocks that I arranged in elaborate patterns on my      pegboard.)    </p>    <p>      When I reached the age of five, though, Mother did enroll      me in public school. The institution, located in nearby      Namb√©, New Mexico, was backed by Cyrus McCormick (a      well-known philanthropist) and headed by a marvelous woman      named Mary Watson . . . and the quality of instruction was      excellent. In fact, I was studying - and loving      - such subjects as simple bacteriology, paleontology,      and archaeology at the age of seven!    </p>    <p>      But local political maneuvering ended McCormick's      influence, so the school's quality soon deteriorated. The      atmosphere became repressive and the work boring. I      distinctly remember an instance, in the "changed"      classroom, when another pupil was stumbling - word by      word - through a reading group recitation. Now I knew      I couldn't <em>help</em> the struggling student without      being labeled a showoff, so I fought my boredom by reading      on in the assigned book. I was working through the text for      the second time when the teacher called upon me to recite,      and then - since I had no idea where to begin -      she soundly chastised me for not paying attention.    </p>    <p>      Similar "noneducational" incidents occurred almost every      day. For example, I was often the first pupil to finish our      frequently assigned seatwork. Each time I asked the teacher      what I should do next, she replied that I should check my      work. When I finished that <em>task</em> , she would tell      me to go over the paper yet again! I soon realized that      there was little reason to be careful the first time I did      my lessons . . . and consequently developed sloppy work      habits.    </p>    <p>      I also developed a strong - and obvious to everyone      around me - case of "schoolphobia". So, with the      blessing of Mary Watson (she had by this time become New      Mexico's State Superintendent of Education), Mother decided      to teach me at home. She gave me only a couple of hours of      instruction each morning - while she did the      household laundry, ironing, mending, and cleaning -      but I gained far more from that brief tutoring than I had      while "working" <em>all</em> day in school.    </p>    <p>      At home, every minute of study counted. No misspelled word      or error in grammar escaped my parent's sharp eyes. I had      to be able to solve every arithmetic problem and answer      every history question (not merely one out of every 25, as      in my public school days). In addition, Mother always      communicated precisely at my level, so I was never made to      feel either confused, bored, stupid, <em>or</em> superior!    </p>    <p>      The Calvert School textbooks we used at home were also more      advanced and interesting than were the regular school's      materials. In fact, I love V.M. Hillyer's <em>A Child's      History of the World</em> (which Calvert students are still      using today) so much that I've even reread the book as an      adult, just for fun. (By contrast, how many grown-ups even      <em>remember</em> the books they used in public school?)    </p>    <p>      And Mother's housekeeping duties never suffered as a result      of her teaching me ... since she had me help out with all      the dusting, ironing, and washday chores. Even so, l had      plenty of extra hours for healthful outside play, relaxing,      drawing, planning houses (I still love to design adobe      homes for do-it-yourselfers), <em>and</em> for experiencing      those hours of solitude during which we learn to "grow our      souls".    </p>    <p>      My "teacher" parent also provided me with extracurricular      activities. She drove me 17 miles to Santa Fe, twice each      week, so I could take dancing lessons ... and paid for the      instruction by playing the piano for the class. She even      formed (and ran) a Girl Scout troop, and my participation      in that group gave me some of my happiest childhood      memories.    </p>    <p>      Of course, my mother could not have done all she did for me      if I hadn't <em>also</em> had a wonderful father. Without      his cooperation, she would never have been able to teach me      at home. Together, my parents gave me a solid educational      grounding. And their instruction paid off: I entered      college at 15, graduated four years later with the highest      honors, and have subsequently earned four additional      degrees.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TEACHING MY CHILDREN TO READ</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of my graduate diplomas was a master's degree in      education from Harvard. I went after <em>that</em>      certificate not to learn how to teach (and, to tell the      truth, the required coursework in no way trained me to      instruct) but, instead, to merely gain official credentials      ... so I would have the legal right to do for my own      youngsters what my mother had done for me.    </p>    <p>      I then taught my first four children (two girls and two      boys) at home until the eldest was eight years old. At that      time my marriage ended in divorce. I had to work      <em>outside</em> the home to make a living, and could no      longer spend the day with my youngsters. Thus, while four      of my offspring were taught to read at home, the youngest      son and daughter learned that basic skill in public school.    </p>    <p>      This unfortunate occurrence <em>did</em> give me a sharp      basis for comparing the value of home and school      instruction. All four older children (now in their early      and middle twenties) are today good readers who enjoy books      greatly. Moreover, three of them developed a spontaneous      - and continuing - interest in creative      writing.    </p>    <p>      The two youngest children - who are in their late      teens - are just as bright as their older siblings      and <em>can</em> , indeed, read competently. But they don't      <em>like</em> to sit down with a book or magazine . . . and      don't write for pleasure, either. Reading inevitably      reminds them of tedious hours spent with uninspiring texts      and teachers ... and that association has "taught" them      that all literary activity is boring.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, I feel that home schooling gave my older      children a great love for reading that the others lack. Yet      my particular teaching procedure was actually very      uncomplicated. Here's what I did:    </p>    <p>      First, I set a good example. I am myself an insatiably      curious, omnivorous reader ... so <em>all</em> of my      children could see from my behavior that reading must be an      enjoyable, rewarding activity for some people. (The      home-taught children, of course, had many more      opportunities to make this observation than did the      others.)    </p>    <p>      Second, I often read aloud to the four older children . . .      individually, so that each one could learn for him- or      herself that books can be interesting and entertaining,      beautiful and funny. (Because I always kept the listener      beside me or on my lap at such times, the child also      learned to associate reading with attention and affection.)    </p>    <p>      Third, I occasionally pointed out distinctivelooking words      as I read ... and watched the youngster's face for that      glimmer of comprehension which appears when a child      discovers that each word has its own specific symbol. At      first, the only response from the young listener would be a      blank look. When this happened, I never pressed the point      but went back to reading the story, because I feel it's      very important not to give children the idea that -      merely because they don't have all the information that      "giant" adults do - they're inadequate or stupid in      any way.    </p>    <p>      Fourth, when the day arrived that a youngster <em>did</em>      start noticing distinctive groups of letters, I knew he or      she was ready to begin to memorize words on the basis of      their general appearance ... to acquire what schoolteachers      call a "sight vocabulary". (For some reason, each of my      four home-taught offspring seemed to reach this point at      the age of two and a half.) I then started daily reading      lessons to help the youngster build up a body of recognized      words. However, I always stopped these lessons at -      or <em>before</em> - the first signs of boredom or      restlessness.    </p>    <p>      Fifth, after making sure that each child had a good sight      vocabulary as a data base, I began pointing out that      distinctive letters - such as the "z" in "buzz"      - have specific sounds, so that the youngster could      eventually acquire the skill of sounding out new words      (professional educators call this "learning to read by the      <em>phonic</em> method").    </p>    <p>      I sometimes used textbooks for such instruction, but never      <em>limited</em> my children to such unexciting volumes.      After all, just as a music student may need to practice in      dull exercise books - but must have access to      beautiful music for inspiration - a beginning reader      may <em>have</em> to spend time with practice texts, but      also needs exposure to entertaining literature in order to      associate reading with enjoyment.    </p>    <p>      When I first started making letter-sound associations, I'd      again watch the child's face for a flicker of understanding      . . . and again the initial response was a blank look. Yet      - as in the case of sight words - a day would      come when each youth suddenly comprehended the fact that a      particular letter can represent a particular sound. And      surprisingly enough, my four youngsters all made this great      discovery at the age of four years . . . almost to the      week!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRINCIPLES FOR TEACHING A CHILD AT HOME</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many parents will, no doubt, have their own ideas about the      best ways to instruct children, but I think that -      having been on both sides of the home-schooling      relationship - I've gained some general insights that      may be worth sharing. Perhaps the most basic (and obvious)      principle is this: What you don't know, you can't teach. Of      course, it is often possible to compensate for not knowing      a subject area by studying it (and, indeed, there's no      better way to learn something than to teach it!).    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, you may sometimes want to get other people to      work with your children in specific areas . . . or perhaps      even consider bartering teaching skills with other parents      who are strong in subjects where your own background is      lacking.    </p>    <p>      No matter what, though, never assume that you're      incompetent to instruct your offspring simply because you      may not have impressive college degrees. If you know      anything interesting that your child doesn't know, you have      a lesson that you can teach. Besides, although formal      education may be essential for mastering a <em>few</em>      subject areas, in most instances the best education is      self-education. An individual who is curious, can read, and      has access to decent resources will learn best on his or      her own . . . with only occasional assistance from experts.    </p>    <p>      Another basic teaching principle I've adopted is that      trying to <em>push</em> a child into learning, against his      or her will, can be counterproductive. The youngster may      get balky (a healthy assertion of that person's right to      individuality). Worse yet, such forcefulness may - by      its inherent implication that something is the matter with      the child because he or she doesn't want to learn the      lesson - cause the youth to lose self-confidence.    </p>    <p>      I've found it better to let my children make their own      decisions about what to study, so they learn - in the      process - to trust their own minds. Naturally, any      young person will occasionally make mistakes in such      choices . . . but he or she will very likely learn from the      errors themselves, and also gain practice in making      decisions (at an age when the consequences of poor judgment      are usually not yet terribly serious).    </p>    <p>      Sometimes, a child will have real difficulty comprehending      a subject. In that case, realize that you may be presenting      the information in a manner that doesn't suit the      particular student ... that the youngster may be ignorant      of some essential basic facts . . . that he or she may not      yet be <em>ready</em> to learn the specific subject ... or      that your pupil's brain simply may not be designed to      understand the material. In any such situation, either try      a different instruction approach or hold off on the topic      for a while and switch the lesson to some other area.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if a subject doesn't appeal to your      child at all, you should try to discover the      <em>reason</em> for his or her lack of interest. After all,      humans are naturally curious (as anyone knows who has      watched an infant earnestly studying his or her toes and      nightie to learn how to distinguish baby from nonbaby!).      But, just as the right teacher or book can make any subject      interesting, by the same token inappropriate instruction or      material will make any topic dull.    </p>    <p>      Last, I believe that high-quality career counseling may be      essential whenever a child's natural interests and      abilities do not eventually become obvious. But be sure to      judge any potential advisors carefully. (I can, as a result      of my own experience with the firm, recommend the Johnson      O'Conner Research Foundation ... which has offices in a      dozen major American cities.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>YOU, TOO, WILL LEARN</strong>    </p>    <p>      I found out when I was a child that being educated at home      can have an important positive influence on a youngster.      Years later - as an adult - I learned that a      homeschooling <em>parent</em> can profit from the      experience as well. And it's a small wonder that this is so      . . . after all, when you teach your own children, you have      a fascinating opportunity to make discoveries about the      most complex instrument in the universe: the human mind.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: A collection of several</em> <em>other      parents' experiences (both positive and negative) with home      schooling can be found in Darcy Williamson's 91-page, large      paperback book,</em> School at Home: An Alternative to the      Public School System <em>(available from many good      bookstores or - for $9.95 plus 95 cents shipping and      handling - from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.
