        <p><em>Has a nine-inch snowfall caught you unprepared? Well, if you can't move it out, pack it in with a . . .</em></p><h5 id="byline">By Jim DeKorne</h5><p>As far as I can tell, there's only one guarantee that can be made concerning weather . . . it'll be unpredictable! Winters are particularly bad in this regard . . . from year to year it's next to <em>impossible</em> to know what to expect.</p><p>For example, it's not uncommon - on my family's New Mexico homestead - for a whole cold season to pass without our seeing more than a few inches of snow. Then again, there <em>have</em> been years when we've been hit with snowfalls of a foot or more within <em>hours</em>, and - during one cold spell - we were effectively snowbound for almost a <em>month</em>, while three-foot drifts formed across our quarter-mile of driveway.</p><p>Since most folks living here can't afford to waste good money buying expensive snowplow attachments for their tractors - especially when such an accessory wouldn't be needed more than once or twice a season - our local inventors have created one of the most efficient <em>homemade</em> wintertime helpers I've ever seen!</p><p>The "New Mexican Snowplow", simply nailed together out of scrap 2 X 8's and weighted down with any available heavy object, is dragged behind a tractor or a four-wheel-drive vehicle to smooth and pack the snow. I've found that two or three passes are usually necessary to tamp my driveway down. . . but soon the surface will become hard enough so that the access road can be driven on <em>without</em> tire chains.</p><p>By following the accompanying diagram, anyone should be able to construct his or her own snowpacker. You'll find that using the simple device sure beats digging out after every snowfall . . . especially if your driveway is as long as mine!</p>
