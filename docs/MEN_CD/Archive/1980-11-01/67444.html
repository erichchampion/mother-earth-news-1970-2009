                <p>      Your "under glass" growing can be twice as successful      - with <em>half</em> the trouble - when you..      .<br />    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Anthony J. De Blasi</h5>     <p>      A lot of folks are confused by the complexities of hothouse      cultivation. Well, if an unsure understanding of the many      published "rules and regulations" is keeping <em>you</em>      from trying greenhouse gardening, just <em>forget</em>      them! All you really have to do to turn your plant palace      into a dynamic package of productivity is to put      <em>real</em> soil in the pots and benches ... give your      greenery plenty of light, air, and space . . . administer      water wisely . . . and feed your hungry charges with      nourishing manure "tea".    </p>    <p>      Besides - by doing without the often-recommended      chemical fertilizers, sterile soil mixes, sprays,      fumigants, systemics, and such - you'll find that you      have a good bit of spare cash left for more      <em>essential</em> items ... such as plants and pots.      You'll also discover that disease and insect infestations,      weak growth, and subnormal performance are (more likely      than not) merely symptoms of improper culture, which      shouldn't trouble the gardener who zeroes in on the basics!   </p>    <p>      <strong>SOIL, AIR, LIGHT, AND SPACE</strong>    </p>    <p>      First of all, grow only those plants that are proven      stalwarts or have been bred for vigor, productivity, and      resistance to disease (in many cases you'll have to do some      experimenting to <em>find</em> such varieties, but other      greenhouse users can often give you "best bet" advice).      Species that don't do well unless they're constantly fed      - or plants that tend to succumb to aphids in spite      of good growing conditions - should be classified as      "unfit" . . . and removed from your list.    </p>         <p>      In order to provide your chosen vegetables and flowers with      good soil, make up a half-and-half mixture of rich garden      loam and compost . . . or one consisting of one-third each      of loam, compost, and peat moss. Then, to each prepared      bushel, add a six-inch potful of well-aged manure and a      four-inch potful of bone meal or wood ashes. If there's      clay in your loam, put some sand in the mixture, too.      (Cacti like a soil composed of one part loam, one part      organic compost, and two parts sand.)    </p>    <p>      Next, be sure to give your greenhouse tenants a breath of      fresh air . . . often! Insect pests - as well as      fungi, mildew, and diseases - just love to attack      plants that suffer from a close atmosphere, so make sure      that your greenhouse is well ventilated (while, of course,      maintaining the desired temperature) and you'll keep      trouble at bay.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that full sun on your hothouse means full      production ... and can cut down on the need for      supplemental winter heat. (The structure can always be      shaded with netting, film, paint, etc. to <em>limit</em>      sunlight ... but you can't bring sun to it once it's been      situated in the shade.)    </p>    <p>      Space is equally important. Vegetation needs room to grow      ... so if you notice the leaves of adjacent plants      touching, it's best to move them away from each other. (Of      course, folks who grow their hothouse flora only in pots      will find the task easy . . . but people who plant directly      in the bench will have to either thin or plan ahead.)    </p>    			     <p>      <strong>TEMPERATURES MADE SIMPLE</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the main concerns of <em>any</em> greenhouse      gardener is to avoid extremes and sudden changes of      temperature in the growing area. So watch for those still,      clear winter days that can make your greenhouse thermometer      reading soar in minutes! On such occasions you may have to      ventilate, even if the <em>outside</em> temperature is      below freezing. <em>Warm</em> weather always calls for      maximum ventilation, with all vents wide open ... exhaust      fan on full (if your greenhouse is equipped with one) . . .      and the door ajar, if necessary.    </p>    <p>      During the winter months, a minimum night temperature of      45-50°F is best, unless you're growing tropical plants.      Even then, the usual 60°F minimum may not be necessary,      because a gardenia, for instance, will winter perfectly      well in a cool greenhouse (it will simply go dormant and      wait for the return of warmer weather before blooming      again). Besides, cooler temperatures <em>favor</em> a wide      range of flowers and vegetables . . . such as lettuce,      herbs, geraniums, cyclamens, and many annuals.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOOD AND WATER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Don't let your plants go dry (unless you're growing      succulents or cacti) . . . but don't try to maintain a      regular watering schedule, either. The variables that      affect the loss of moisture from the soil (including      weather, the size of the container, the kind of plant,      etc.) are just too many to cope with routinely. Instead,      simply check the pots <em>often</em> : When the surface      soil is dry to the touch, water them thoroughly. (Dormant      or inactive plants, on the other hand, should be kept      barely moist.) It's simple ... it's pleasant ... and your      indoor crops will reward you for the individual attention      by growing bigger and better!    </p>        <p>      I've found that supplemental feedings aren't necessary for      any plant that's been <em>recently</em> potted in good      soil. In already established plants, weak or slow growth      that's not attributable to winter doldrums or dormancy      - or a yellowing of the leaves during a period of      active development - means one of two things: The      roots have filled the pot and require more room, or the      plant needs additional nutrients. If evidence points to the      latter problem, offer the patient a "spot of tea". Here's      how:    </p>    <p>      Fill a large, leakproof, rotproof pail with water, and add      a generous quantity of manure. After the mix has been      allowed to soak for several days, pour the liquid into your      watering container through an old strainer. Dilute it      - if necessary - until it's the color of weak      tea, and give your plants a normal watering of this "super      soup". (Be sure to periodically feed plants that      <em>like</em> to be potbound, such as specimen jasmines or      geraniums.)    </p>    <p>      If possible, it's best to give your hothouse residents      "tea" on the morning of a bright day. Skip such feedings in      the middle of long spells of dull or cold weather, and      <em>don't</em> feed a dormant or ailing plant (that would      be akin to asking a sick person to eat a big meal).    </p>    <p>      <strong>ATTITUDES AND INSECTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most of the six- and eight-legged creatures, and      <em>other</em> so-called pests, that inhabit your      greenhouse are simply living out their life cycles and      aren't really all that interested in your plants. No doubt      you'll spy aphids now and then, but - if you're      sticking to the basic rules - you aren't likely to be      faced with an aphid buildup or takeover. Should a plant      suddenly become infested, just remove it to other quarters      and rinse the bugs off (assuming the specimen is worth the      trouble). Keep it isolated and watch it carefully.    </p>    <p>      If the problem returns, get rid of the plant . . . because      you can be sure there's <em>something wrong</em> with it.      (But <em>don't</em> discard it, or any diseased greenery,      right outside the door. In fact, it's a good idea to      eliminate weeds-both inside and outside the structure-so      wind and people won't be so likely to bring problems in      with them.)    </p>    <p>      White flies, I've discovered, detest an organically managed      greenhouse. Slugs, too, seek plants that are feeble from      want of good growing conditions. (The latter pests'      territory is usually confined to the dingy areas under the      benches. Search such hiding spots and destroy the "enemy"      wherever you find it.) Earwigs may be trapped underneath      several strategically placed rags, where you'll find the      little pests hiding during the day and can drown them.    </p>        <p>      Tiny creatures that hop when disturbed are harmless      springtails. If you have an infestation of thrips, spider      mites, or sow bugs, chances are you haven't been heeding      the rules. And if you don't bring mealybugs and scales      <em>into</em> the greenhouse, you won't <em>have</em> any      of them! So when you buy <em>woody</em> plants (especially      gardenias), make absolutely certain they're clean.    </p>    <p>      <em>Don't, however, expect that your greenhouse will be      100% pest-free!</em> It's not a sterile habitat, and it      would be both unreasonable and <em>unnatural</em> to strive      toward such a goal. If your plants are free from the      handicaps of poor culture, pests will automatically fall      under control, and your efforts will be reduced to      maintaining a watchful eye ... a vigilant hand-picking      schedule ... and - otherwise - a general      attitude of loving laissez faire.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUMMER CLEANOUTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      When summer comes, it's a good practice to empty the      greenhouse, so that - in the process of the      enclosure's complete evacuation and drying out - any      lingering insects will leave. This cleaning will provide      you with a fresh start come fall (you should, of course,      double-check everything you bring back in). Also, with the      building empty you have an excellent place to dry herbs:      Choose a sunny day . . . spread your plants out on clean      sheets or towels . . . and see how fast they're ready for      storage!    </p>    <p>      And . . . that's really all there is to the "science" of      hothouse horticulture. When you rely on nature, you'll have      healthy, eager plants that are not easily fazed by changes      in growing conditions. They'll have more normal development      of roots, stems, and leaves. . . better fruiting and      maturation. . . and stronger flavors and colors. And one of      the <em>joys</em> of such greenhouse productivity is the      fact that there's nothing tricky about it at all!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If this article has given you a craving      for a sun-powered growing room of your own, you might be      interested to know that MOTHER has a set of detailed,      step-by-step plans - describing how to build an      attractive and practical 80-square-foot greenhouse for a      cost of about $140 - that you can order for $10      postpaid from Mother's Plans, Backyard Greenhouse, P.O.
