                    <h5 id="byline">      BY Stephen Matula    </h5>    <p>      I've long dreamed of getting back to the land ... but      - for many years - I wasn't sure just how far      "back" I wanted to go. So I searched for an in-between job      that would allow me to test the workability of my goal      <em>before</em> I actually committed myself to it, and      eventually heard about the National Park Service's      volunteer program, which offers seasonal work in national      parks all over the country. I looked through the job      listings ... applied for three that interested me ... and      - luck must have been with me - landed the post      of a back-country guard for the Olympic National Park in      Washington state.    </p>    <h3>HOME SWEET HOME</h3>    <p>      On my first hike in to Elkhorn, the remote outpost where I      was to live and work, I was accompanied by the local ranger      and his wife. While helping me move in, the pair eased some      of my jitters by filling me in on the details of the job      and providing lots of timesaving hints for quickly      accomplishing the in-cabin chores.    </p>    <p>      My duties were much like those of any park ranger: I      collected trash left by campers, answered visitors'      questions, did repair and drainage work on the mountain      trails, and maintained the guard station. I was also      responsible for other tasks, such as splitting cedar shakes      for a roof and carrying emergency rations to posts that      were miles from my own.    </p>    <p>      Elkhorn is a two-room log building with battleship gray      paint on the floor, white split boards on the ceiling,      beige panels in the living/sleeping room, and glossy white      walls in the kitchen. (The single inner wall of the hut,      which separates the two rooms, is a simple partition of      vertical poles with thick cedar shakes nailed to them.)    </p>    <p>      The usual work schedule consisted of ten days on duty      followed by four days off. Since the cabin is located 12      miles up a trail, I usually spent the first and last days      of my work period hiking to and from the post. During the      six-hour walk, I picked up litter and moved any trees that      had fallen across the path. Upon reaching "home"      <em>following</em> my days off, I always immediately fired      up the small woodstove to take the chill off the place, put      a pot of tea on to brew, and organized my gear to prepare      for eight days of tough physical labor.    </p>    <h3>BACK-COUNTRY CUISINE</h3>    <p>      Cooking soon became one of my favorite wilderness      activities, since I found it remarkably easy to adapt to      the quirks of my cabin's old woodburning cookstove. Before      long I'd developed the habit of keeping a large pot of      water simmering on the back of the stove . . . and I also      learned how to vary the positions of pots and pans in order      to cook at different temperatures. (I usually started a      three-course meal by setting every pot directly      <em>over</em> the firebox ... then, by serving time, all      the utensils would be clustered at the cool end of the      stove top.)    </p>    <p>      And my backwoods diet was more varied ( <em>and</em> tasty)      than you might think! The ranger left me a large supply of      canned goods, and I supplemented the stock with my own tea,      rice, noodles, beans, cornmeal, whole wheat bread, and      sprouts. One of my favorite dishes was pinto beans and      rice, a recipe I picked up from an old-timer who'd spent a      good many years in the mountains. To make the simple meal,      I'd first soak one part beans in a quart of water all day      long . . . then - when I came in from work - I      would add three parts brown rice to the softened beans and      cook the stew for an hour or so, until the edibles were      tender. (For a tangier taste, I sometimes added a spoonful      or two of catsup and an equal measure of apple cider      vinegar... delicious!)    </p>    <p>      Fall in the Olympics is always a rainy season, so I was      able to harvest a bumper crop of mushrooms from the wet      forest that year. Since I'm not an expert on fungi, I      simply learned to recognize one edible variety that was      common in my area, and foraged only for that particular      spore producer. I usually prepared the tasty mushrooms by      slicing them and saut√©ing them in butter over low      heat until they were half their original size.    </p>    <p>      I also supplemented my diet with the occasional mountain      trout that I either panfried or - better yet -      broiled over hardwood embers. (To "open-fire" cook my      catch, I'd simply clean the fish, split it down the middle,      and spread the two halves on a grate over a small fire.      Once the flesh had turned white and crumbly, I'd heap it on      rice or noodles . . . and feast heartily!)    </p>    <h3>ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME</h3>    <p>      My other domestic chores included washing clothes . . .      which was always a big undertaking, even though my working      wardrobe consisted of nothing more than one pair of pants,      several shirts, underclothes, socks, and a few dish towels.      To begin the cleaning process, I'd fill a five-gallon      bucket about half full of warm water . . . then add a      sprinkling of detergent and my dirty garb. The agitator for      my do-it-yourself washer was a regular sink plunger . . .      operated by hand, of course. After about ten minutes of      energetic plunging (it's good for whatever ails ya!), I'd      rinse each garment separately and hang everything on a rope      strung between my hut and the woodshed. (The moist      Washington weather, however, usually wouldn't allow clothes      to dry completely . . . so I often had to drape the damp      items over an <em>indoor</em> clothesline .)    </p>    <p>      Showers were also rustic affairs at Elkhorn. Whenever I      decided that a cleansing was overdue, I'd put about 2-1/2      gallons of water to warm on the woodstove (the heat left      over from cooking breakfast or dinner was usually enough to      start it boiling). Meanwhile, I'd half-fill a      plastic-coated firefighting waterbag with cold water. When      the boiling liquid was added to the sack, the resulting      water temperature would be perfect. Then - with the      contraption hanging from a nail on one of the porch beams      - I would use the hose attached to the bottom of the      bag to enjoy a nice, warm shower.    </p>    <h3>WOOD CHOPPING</h3>    <p>      Whenever I began to ache for a little fun, I simply climbed      the steep hill that rose behind my cabin to a small,      natural shelf where strong winds had knocked down several      trees. The ranger had already cut the large evergreens into      16"-thick rounds and laid them on their sides to prevent      water saturation and rot. My homespun entertainment      consisted of rolling a wooden cylinder to the edge of the      shelf, pushing it off, and leaning back to watch the show.      I found that - if I aimed carefully - I could      send the logs right up to the edge of the back porch . . .      and then the work began.    </p>    <p>      My method was to split each beast in half and then into      quarters ... hoist a chunk to the top of the chopping block      (which was a <em>whole</em> cross section of a tree trunk)      . . . and whack off the inside point of the wooden wedge.      Each remaining bolt was then split into 2" X 8" pieces, and      finally chopped into stovewood.    </p>    <p>      This neatly cut timber didn't go into <em>my</em> stove,      however, since I was still working my way through a store      of lumber cut by the <em>previous</em> year's outpost      guard. In turn, I stacked my newly split pieces on the      porch to dry . . . and then stowed them in the shed before      I left, so that the volunteer who followed me at Elkhorn      would also have plenty of well-aged fuel.    </p>    <h3>NIGHTFALL</h3>    <p>      After each day's chores were done, and the report was      entered in the cabin journal, I had a chance to rest and      enjoy the quiet evening. I usually just collapsed into a      big easy chair with my harmonica or a pile of magazines      (some of which were over 30-years old!) left behind by my      predecessors, campers, and visitors. On especially still      nights, I liked to wander out into the meadow and look back      at the little cabin tucked into the woods. It made a      peaceful scene . . . with a ribbon of smoke rising straight      up from the stovepipe in its roof, and the muted glow of my      gas lantern shining from the windows.    </p>    <p>      Once the damp night chill of the Olympic Mountains had      seeped through my clothes, however, I always retreated to      the warmth of the little woodstove . . . and savored the      end of another day as a National Forest station guard. And,      although I do feel that my stay in the Olympics was all too      short, it was definitely a worthwhile experience. After      all, it showed me that I really can make it on my own in      the wilderness, <em>and</em> that I'll be happy moving as      <em>far</em> back to the land as I can!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Related Articles:</strong>    </p>    <p>      LOOKOUT-TOWER LIVING    </p>    <p>      LIVE AND LEARN IN THE FOREST!    </p>
