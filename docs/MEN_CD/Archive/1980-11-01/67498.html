                <p>      Flea markets and craft fairs can be fun and profitable      places to hawk your wares, but why not...<br />    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Sherry Robinson    </h5>    <p>      Show me a successful craftsperson, and I'll show you a good      peddler. Or - to put it a bit more grandly -      behind every creative talent there's a marketing genius.    </p>    <p>      After all, when you <em>make</em> a "thing of beauty",      you're only half done. Before you can turn your artwork      into income, you'll have to know how to make people want to      <em>buy</em> it! Most of us weren't born salesfolk. As      children, it was usually with dread and gloom that we      trudged door to door to sell Girl Scout cookies, greeting      cards, or raffle tickets. However, if you still      <em>suffer</em> from that same old gnawing shyness, maybe l      can offer a few marketing tricks that'll help relieve the      pain.    </p>		<h3>ARE YOU READY?</h3>        <p>      Unless your product is so unusual and in demand that the      public will trample the woods to reach your door, you'll      have to cart your wares to the potential buyers. Of course,      you can sell direct (at flea markets, for example), but if      you want the success and security that come with multiple      outlets and repeat orders, you must deal with a more      difficult problem: how to convince retail stores to buy      your goods.    </p>    <p>      In order to sell to such market-wise customers, you'll      usually have to make what's referred to in the lingo of the      trade as a "mobile presentation". And if that phrase makes      you think of the stereotyped dapper salesman who whips open      an attach√© case with a slick exhibit of samples,      charts, color photographs, and the like . . . well, you're      almost right! Because, although the "slick and dapper"      aren't absolutely necessary, a modicum of professionalism      is required if you're to be truly successful.    </p>    <p>      If you're dealing with small items, a relatively neat      display of samples on a board or card will suffice. Should      your goods be bulky or heavy though, it's best to make a      scrapbook of good clear photographs of your products . . .      plus a few shots of yourself at work. (It's often easy to      find a photographer who'll barter with you.)    </p>    <p>      For <em>medium-sized</em> crafts, you might consider      setting up a small suitcase in which to display your wares      to curious shopkeepers. For a long time, I pulled ceramic      beads and jewelry wrapped in recycled bags out of pockets      and purses . . . until my father-in-law gave me a worn-out      (to him) briefcase. That darn thing is <em>handy</em> ! Now      I have a place to display samples of all my finished goods,      and the interior pockets can hold invoices, receipts,      catalogs, business cards, notepads, and pens as well.    </p>    <p>      <em>Invoices . . . receipts?</em> Well, you may not think      you need such formalities, but the stores' owners will      expect them. After all, when you fill an order,      <em>you</em> need to send an invoice . . . and if you do      manage to sell the storekeeper some items outright, you      have to give a receipt. You <em>can</em> do either on a      plain sheet of paper, but you can get batches of the "real      thing" - for just a few dollars - from any      office supply store. Besides, the mere fact that you such      common business forms (along with some sharp-looking      business cards to introduce yourself and leave behind as a      reminder of your existence) will make you seem more      responsible and professional.    </p>    		<h3>PICK YOUR TARGETS</h3>    <p>      Once you've prepared the presentation, <em>carefully</em>      select the stores that you'll visit.    </p>    <p>      Start with the small shops and work your way up to the big      department stores . . . (this approach will allow you to      polish your presentation while fewer sales are at stake).    </p>    <p>      The best way to locate good outlets is to talk to other      craftspeople about stores that have produced for      <em>them</em> . Keep your ears open for any "darling little      shops" your friends and relatives might discover, too! And      don't overlook the Yellow Pages in the phone book . . . an      ad can often tell you a lot about a store's merchandise.    </p>    <p>      You'll find it easiest to "break in" by selling through      shops that work on consignment (such outlets will usually      mark your price up a third and pay you when the item      sells). The periodic payments that good consignment stores      can be expected to produce are always a pleasant surprise.      Be cautious, however . . . some of these shops take little      responsibility for the goods . . . so choose ones in nearby      locations that can be checked on from time to time.    </p>		<h3>AIM FOR SUCCESS</h3>    <p>      When you've located stores that look as if they might be      worthwhile outlets for your particular wares, arrange to      visit them. If the shops are scattered over great      distances, you might want to telephone first: Ask for the      buyer (be sure to note the name for future reference) and      find out whether he or she would be interested in selling      whatever you make. Remember, though, that - while a      phone call can be a good first step - there's nothing      like your smiling face to brighten up the glory of your      specialty.    </p>    <p>      I probably don't have to tell you the obvious, but I will      anyway: Always be neat and clean. You won't sell much      - <em>especially</em> in the kinds of swank resort      areas that bring top prices for crafts - if your very      presence embarrasses the shop owner.    </p>    <p>      Try to approach your prospects at times when they're least      likely to be rushed. Avoid, if possible, Monday mornings      and Friday evenings . . . and <em>any</em> day just before      lunch.    </p>    <p>      And when you make your first visit, don't be so      enthusiastic that you just rush in the door and make your      pitch. Case the joint! If you were a customer, would you      patronize the place? Is it crowded? Do the shoppers buy or      do most of them just browse? Is there dust on the      merchandise? (That likely means that it doesn't sell very      fast.)    </p>    <p>      Look over the inventory, too, and check out the prices.      Does the store carry items somewhat similar to yours (or      much too similar)? Are your prices competitive? (Remember      that stores generally <em>sell</em> homemade items for      twice the price paid to the craftsperson . . . a practice      that's known as keystoning.) Is the shop <em>under</em>      supplied with a particular product? (File that information      in your head . . . if the item is something you could      provide.)    </p>    <p>      Judge fairly, but do be picky. After all, you don't want      your crafts in just any old store. If you're not impressed      with an establishment, don't bother with it.    </p>    		<h3>SELL WITH A SMILE</h3>        <p>      After you've completed your inspection, simply ask any      salesperson if you may speak to the buyer. (In small shops      you may well find that you're already face-to-face with the      owner/salesperson/buyer/janitor!) Here's how to approach      this brief but important encounter:    </p>    <p>      For one thing, do business only when you're in a relaxed      and positive mood, because your <em>attitude</em> can be      the most important ingredient in the sale. Buyers are quick      to sense a negative or hesitant approach . . . and will      often respond to it by not purchasing your merchandise.    </p>    <p>      Therefore - <em>cheerfully</em> - ask the      persor in charge whether he or she would like to see your      product. Notice we say <em>see</em> . . . not buy. For some      reason the words "buy" and "sell" put off potential      clients. "Seeing" something implies no commitment and most      buyers are on the lookout for new items to market.    </p>    <p>      If possible, put an item in the buyer's hand or set it down      where he or she can touch it. Explain a bit about how you      make the product, the materials involved, and the special      techniques you use. If you've already sold to other shops      that are successful with your product, mention them.      Meanwhile, the tactile sensation of your goods (and your      obvious skill at your craft) should be working <em>for</em>      you.    </p>    <h3>KNOW THE SCORE</h3>    <p>      Next comes the big question of "how much". Be prepared to      quote prices singly, by the dozen, and - if you can      <em>supply</em> large numbers of items - even by the      gross. Try to give the buyer a break on quantity purchases.      If you've figured your prices so that you have room to      dicker, it's your privilege to do so. However, if you've      tagged your goods at rock bottom, you might tell the      customer that other shops pay that amount and that it would      be unfair to sell to anyone for less.    </p>    <p>      In your great eagerness to make a sale, <em>don't</em>      quote a ridiculously low figure that you'll regret later      on. Unless you've come up with something entirely new in      the crafts world, there's probably an established "going      rate" for your product. You <em>might</em> want to agree in      advance on the amount of markup. Some stores will      <em>triple</em> - rather than double - your      price if they think they can get away with it . . . and      it's common knowledge that the higher the price, the slower      your crafts will sell.    </p>    <p>      When you land an order, give the buyer a realistic delivery      date. Avoid promises of early fulfillment if you know good      and well that - in the meantime - you'll also      have to cut a few cords of firewood, cope with a lambing      ewe, or build a bathroom . . . because once you've      committed yourself, you must make sure to <em>deliver</em>      on that date. Remember that the first sale is just the      <em>initial</em> victory. The great advantage of selling      through stores is the potential for reorders that can put      some security into your life . . . and you won't get repeat      business unless you prove to be reliable <em>and</em>      skillful!    </p>    <h3>WHEN YOU MISS THE TARGET</h3>    <p>      There are several types of negative responses that you      might receive from store buyers. The first is definite and      emphatic ... when the man or woman doesn't like your goods      and tells you so! (Sure it's an ego blow, but don't be      overwhelmed . . . just go on to the next store.) On the      other hand, it may be that your product is simply not what      the store's customers want. Or perhaps the buyer loves it,      but the store is low on capital or the tourist trade is      down. (Make a point to return to such an outlet later on.)    </p>    <p>      Another kind of no, which is really a maybe, goes like      this: "I don't know .. . we've never had that type of thing      in here before!" In this case your reply should be, "Would      you like to try out a few (or one, or a sample order) and      see how it goes?"    </p>    <p>      If the buyer still hesitates - and you think the item      <em>would</em> sell in the shop if given a chance -      you can offer to replace the product if that particular      style doesn't please the store's customers. (Don't offer a      <em>refund</em> , mind you - as that would place you      in the ticklish position of shelling out money at the whim      of the owner - but simply an exchange for a      <em>different</em> craftwork at the same price.)    </p>    <p>      As an aid to the reluctant buyer, take along a headful of      ideas. Propose a variation or some new thing you're working      on. Should you be asked, "Do you think you could make      such-and-such?" . . . consider the suggestion seriously.      It's the buyer's job to know what will sell in that      particular store.    </p>    <p>      If you constantly get negative or hesitant responses, take      a hard look at your product . . . maybe it's just plain      undesirable. Don't give up if you come to this realization,      though. Just make something <em>else</em> , and keep on      trying new items until you <em>do</em> discover a craft      that sells.    </p>    <p>      There can be other causes for rejection, too. Is your craft      relatively easy to learn? Are the materials common? If so,      the market may be glutted with such items. Or your timing      could be responsible for refusals: For example, it's very      difficult to push craftwares between January and April. You      should plan ahead for the big holidays and the peak season      ... especially if you sell in resort areas. (Stores may put      in orders for Christmas as early as August or September.)    </p>    <h3>COLLECT YOUR WINNINGS</h3>    <p>      It's customary for shops to pay their bills at the end of      the month, so - if you've shipped or invoiced your      goods on the first - you may have to wait as much as      30 days to be paid. This delay means that the serious home      business craftsperson has to keep up the self-discipline of      constant production and sales.    </p>    <p>      If the 10th of the following month rolls by with no check      from one of your buyers, send out a copy of your invoice      with "past due" written on it. If that doesn't work, write      a letter . . . then call . . . and, finally, remove your      goods from the store. (This shouldn't happen often, but it      <em>does</em> occur ... and is another good reason to pick      your outlets carefully.)    </p>		<h3>GOOD LUCK!</h3>    <p>      Any or all of these suggestions should smooth your path to      successful sales. Just remember that when you go out to      market your crafts, you have two great forces at work for      you: one, the strong belief in your product . . . and two,      the necessity of making a living.    </p>    <p>      And - for those who love to spend their days in the      creation of beautiful things - selling handmade      products is much more fun than punching the old time clock!    </p>
