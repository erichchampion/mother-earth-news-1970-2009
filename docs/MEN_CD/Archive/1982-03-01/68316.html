                        <p>      Lately, more and more people hove begun to understand just      how limited-in both variety and nutritional      value-our "modern" diets have become. This      realization has sparked a new and widespread interest in      the culinary and therapeutic uses of herbs . . . those      plants which-although not well-known      today-were, just one short generation ago, honored      "guests" on the dinner tables and in the medicine chests of      our grandparents' homes. In this regular feature, MOTHER      will examine the availability, cultivation, and benefits of      our "forgotten" vegetable foods and remedies . . .      and-we hope-help prevent the loss of still      another bit of an cestral lore.</p><p> Vinegar and sauce      bearnaise, tartar sauce and hollandaise . . . what do all      these condiments have in common? Why, they can all include      tarragon, of course, the crown prince of the      <em>Artemisia</em> herbs . . . whose family includes the      fragrant southernwood, wormwood, the Silver King      ornamental, and our native western sagebrush.</p><p> There are two      species of tarragon: the Russian, <em>Artemisia      dracunculoides</em> (native to Asia), which is the hardier,      more prolific-and less desirable-of the pair .      . . and the French, <em>Artemisia dracunculus</em> (from      southern Europe), which contains the essential oils so      treasured in cooking.</p><p> Known as estragon or herbe au dragon      in France-where it's considered one of the fine (as      opposed to robust) herbs and is a mainstay of that nation's      famous cuisine-tarragon lends a distinctive and      delicious flavor to chicken, veal, seafood, numerous      vegetables, salads, sauces, marinades, and more. The herb      must be used with a light hand, however, because its      flavor-something of anise, something of camphor, and      something unique-is so fierce that it overpowers      other tastes with ease!</p><p> In the Middle Ages the herb was      thought to increase physical stamina, so many pilgrims put      sprigs of it inside their shoes before setting out on a      journey. And-although its use today is almost      exclusively culinary-people have employed tarragon as      a cure for hiccups, tooth ache, worms, indigestion, air      swallowing, rheumatism, lack of appetite, irregular menses,      and water retention.</p><p> An attractive plant, French tarragon      is a moderately tall (two-to three-foot) perennial with      long, narrow leaves which are green (rather than gray      green, as are those of other Artemisia species), smooth,      and entire. Its flowers, yellow mingled with black, appear      in August . . . but seldom open fully and, unlike the      Russian variety, almost never set seed. The long, fibrous      roots grow more laterally than vertically, and may thus be      injured by too vigorous hoeing.</p><p> Propagation is accomplished      through the use of cuttings taken in early spring, or by      root division in March or April. The plants do best if      spaced well apart in rich, well-drained, and somewhat dry      soil. Once established, they should be fertilized with a      liquid solution such as fish emulsion. Generous layers of      mulch will help the herbs make it through the winter. Every      four years or so, they'll need to be divided to prevent      their losing vigor.</p><p> Cuttings for the kitchen can be taken      in June. When picking leaves for drying, however, it's best      to wait until July . . . when the lower foliage starts      turning yellow. Carefully strip the leaves from the stems      and dry them in a shaded, well-ventilated area (no hotter      than 90Â°F) . . . then use airtight containers for      storage, or the foliage will reabsorb moisture.    </p>    <p>      Tarragon has been known in the Old World for centuries, but      it didn't reach America until the early 1800's. Its      popularity here has increased with today's rebirth of      interest in herb culture, but it's not always easy to find      nursery plants. Some good sources to try, however, include      [1] Sunny Farm Nursery, Dept. TMEN, 9448 Mayfield Road,      Chesterland, Ohio 44026 (catalog $1.00, refundable) . . .      [2] White Flower Farm, Dept. TMEN, Route 63, Litchfield,      Connecticut 06759 (an initial $5.00 charge covers three      full-color publications: two 75- to 100-page catalogs and      the company's special Christmas Notes) . . . and [3]      Taylor's Herb Garden, Inc., Dept.
