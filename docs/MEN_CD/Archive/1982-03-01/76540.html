        <p><em>In celebration of little-known MOTHER-type folks from all over.</em></p><h3>JEREMIAH JOHNSON: WILDLIFE WARDEN</h3><p>Numerous cages crowd Jeremiah Johnson's (yep, that's his name all right!) Albuquerque, New Mexico home and back yard . . . each sheltering a rehabilitating wild creature. Johnson-who holds state and federal permits allowing him to care for sick and injured animals that are otherwise illegal to keep captive-first nurses his patients back to health, and then, if necessary, retrains them to hunt . . . by providing them with live food. Occasionally, however, a severely injured victim is unable to return to the wilderness: Lucy, the great horned owl pictured with Jeremiah, will never be able to survive on her own, since a bullet wound left her without control of some of her most important flight feathers.<br /><br />Because he's repeatedly had to come to the aid of animals abused by children, Johnson has set up a program-which is presented at schools and youth clubs-to help prevent such mistreatment. "I simply emphasize the basic principles of ecological balance," says the 28year-old healer. "And, by the end of my talk, the youngsters in the audience usually agree with me that, since each of nature's creatures plays a wide variety of roles in the environment, no animal can be classified as either 'good' or 'bad'."- <em>Martin Frentzel</em>.</p><h3>MED WORLD: HELP FOR THE HANDICAPPED</h3><p>There's a new and growing company in Chipley, Florida that's been supplying medical products to those who require them-at prices that low-income people can afford-since January of 1981. Med World (it was mentioned in the Access column in issue 73) was started by-and is staffed with-the handicapped . . . folks who've become fed up with the usually exorbitant costs of healthcare items. The firm designs, manufactures, and markets a complete line of self-help and patient-care supplies, ranging from eating utensils to automotive equipment for the disabled . . . and includes a special products division that designs and builds-by request only-occupational, recreational, and household equipment and aids.<br /><br />Manager Curtis T. Reynolds strongly urges that those in need of medical products contact Med World before buying elsewhere (hard nosed comparison shoppers make up some of the firm's most faithful customers). "If we can't save you money, no one can," says Reynolds . . . and, as orders increase, the business is able to offer further discounts to its patrons by purchasing in volume. For a copy of the company's mail order catalog, send $1.00 (it'll be refunded with the first order) to Med World, Dept. TMEN, Route 2, Box 37, Chipley, Florida 32428. . . or telephone 904/638-7156.-JV.</p><h3>JAY BROWN: STAGECOACH SAVVY</h3><p>When Jay Brown first decided to take up his current hobby-building stage coaches-he was disappointed to discover that there was little information to be found on the subject. So Brown decided to get some hands-on experience. Jay's idea was to start repairing ailing coaches, in order to study the vehicles' assembly . . . and he began duplicating each carriage part as he removed it to be fixed or refinished. When the craftsman had enough components (and sufficient know-how), he began building his first stagecoach . . . which he finished during the summer of 1977 and dubbed "The Weather ford" (see photo). Encouraged, Jay hunkered down and constructed his second and third models, "The Las Vegas" and "The Cheyenne" ... and went on to complete a total of 12 hand built coaches (four more are currently in the works).<br /><br />Over the years, Brown has managed to acquire only a few of the special tools which are traditionally required for his avocation. He still has to beat out chassis pieces manually, for instance, and sew leather with a hand awl. But the artisan's careful work has earned him high regard, and his carriages have sold quickly. Still, Jay has felt a pang of loss as he's relinquished each masterpiece . . . and he continues to dream of the fine oak coach, curtained in buffalo hide-perhaps-and upholstered in red velvet, that he will someday build to keep. -Bernice Maddux.</p><h3>IN BRIEF</h3><p>Hornsmith G. ATLEE CROUSE may be the last master of a dying art: The Reinholds, Pennsylvania resident fashions buttons, buckles, combs, and jewelry from steer horns . . . as proprietor of the business his family established in 1824. The most important tool in Crouse's shop is a 104-year-old machine that cuts the teeth on combs . . . but the device will eventually have to sit idle . . . when the artisan can no longer obtain the necessary raw materials. "Cow horns aren't heavy enough for my work," explains Crouse. "I have to use horns from steers at least three years of age, and nobody feeds steers for three years anymore."<br /><br />When ED WHEELER and his family had gotten their fill of Los Angeles, they moved to a five-acre farm near Coos Bay, Oregon and came up with an ingenious idea for self employment. Little by little the Wheelers purchased and furnished 24 travel trailers and began renting them out to vacationers. Each customer selects one of the numerous campsites from Brookings to Lincoln City along the Oregon coast and states his or her day of arrival. The Wheelers then deliver a trailer to the designated spot, take care of all hookups, and retrieve the rig on the specified day of departure. For information, contact Ed Wheeler, Northwest Trailer Rentals, Dept. TMEN, Box 91, Coos Bay, Oregon 97420.<br /><br />Members of a group called WOMEN INVOLVED IN FARM ECONOMICS (WIFE) are trying to spread the word that distilled grain can provide both fuel and food. The protein concentrated dried mash that's left after the process of turning grain into alcohol can, you see, be used in numerous recipes, some of the best of which are included in <em>Renewed Grain</em>. . . a booklet compiled by the Valley County, Montana division of WIFE. The spiral-bound collection of recipes is available for $2.00 plus 752 postage and handling from Shirley Ball, Dept. TMEN, South Route No. 206, Nashua, Montana 59248.<br /><br />University of Wisconsin graduate student WILLIAM SCHMITT has developed a product called aerogel, which insulates 15 to 18 times as well as a sheet of glass. Though the substance-which starts as a gelatinous slurry of silica sand-will dissolve back into powder form if it comes in contact with water, Schmitt has managed to devise a thermal window prototype made up of a thin core of aerogel sheeted with conventional glass and sealed securely around its edges with epoxy. -JV.</p>
