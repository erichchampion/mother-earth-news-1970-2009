                    <p>Invest a minimum amount of time and money, and still bring in a bountiful      harvest!    </p>    		<hr />           <h3>     Dinny Slaughter    </h3>    <p>      I've come to the smug conclusion that many home gardeners      (I have in mind those folks who spend as much as 100 hours      of labor to grow $100 worth of produce) are somewhat akin      to masochists. And I'm convinced that most people      would-if they were to keep complete records of the      total time and expense their gardens require-be      amazed at how much those homegrown vegetables actually      cost!</p><p> I, on the other hand, can afford to be smug . . .      since, after many years of planning, I've gradually      whittled my garden work routine down to a pleasurable size.      I put in no more than eight hours of toil, and spend less      than $25, over an entire season! Here's how I do it.     </p>		 <h3>		 GROUND PREPARATION		 </h3>		 <p>		 First, I got rid of my rototiller. For my purposes the tool cost too much money      (you should be sure to include the price of such a machine,      and its upkeep, in any gardening expense records) . . . was      excessively noisy . . . jerked my arms off . . burned      expensive gasoline . . . made my plant rows too wide      (forcing me to work a larger-than-necessary plot) . . .      and, when used for weeding, sometimes actually damaged      roots and slowed down the plants' growth. My tools now      consist of an old stone rake and a hoe. That's it!</p><p> My      second step was to cut my plot to a manageable 18' X 38'      size, which-I've found-is plenty large enough      to supply my family's needs . . . if it's planned and      planted properly.</p><p> Here in Virginia, I can begin gardening      during the last week of April. (I could start earlier, but      most of the seeds would just lie in the ground, waiting for      more warmth, anyway!) At that point, I call a neighbor's      son who has a rototiller, and in about an hour the lad can      work my plot twice in opposite directions, turning under      all the ashes and manure I've thrown on top of the soil      during the winter. For his efforts, he receives $10 . ..      after which I don't see him or the tiller for another year.      Then, starting at one end of my garden (I alternate each      year), </p><p>I begin to form the first bed across the 18'      dimension. By putting in rows in this direction, I'm able      to stand along the garden's 38' edge and use the rake to      reach out to the middle of the plot, leveling the earth and      drawing the clods and stones toward me (I ignore anything      less than the size of a marble). I rake about a 3' swath at      a time from one side, and then repeat the process from the      other . . . completing one 3' X 18' area. This way, all the      larger lumps end up along the plot's length, where they're      left.			</p>			<h3>			CROP PLANTING			</h3>			<p>			I prepare a very rough seedbed in this manner for each vegetable in turn, then      merely hold the rake upside down and drag the handle's      rounded end through the dirt to lay out my first row. (The      depth of the trench will, of course, depend on the amount      of downward pressure exerted on the handle as I walk across      the plot.) Next, with my size-nine shoe, I measure over one      foot and draw another furrow . . . or two, depending on how      many rows are desired for that particular crop.</p><p> It's not      necessary, by the way, to slow things down by marking      prospective rows with string. Straight lines please      gardeners, not plants! Besides, with 18' rows running only      a foot or two apart, it's pretty easy to keep them just      about parallel.</p><p> After dropping the seeds into the trenches,      I reverse my rake-so its head is on the soil with the      points facing up-and use the flat back to pull a      small amount of earth over them. Finally, I just walk      heel-to-toe down the furrows to pack the seeds in.</p><p> My first      three rows are usually made up of spring onions, which I      plant two inches apart. Later, when I start to use a few      each day for salads, I simply pull every other one, leaving      an additional space for the remaining plants to mature.      Then, as the season progresses, fewer onions are needed      daily, because the bulbs get progressively larger.</p><p> I follow      the same simple process for sowing beans and beets. When      starting the tomatoes and peppers, though, I don't even      bother with raking, since the transplants don't seem to      mind a clod here and there. I just use the hoe to make      holes and set them in . . . and it doesn't take more than      ten minutes to plant the lot. It takes me another 20      minutes (at the most) to rake a bed for the corn, drag the      handle across the plot five times, drop the seeds in every      four inches, and cover them over.</p><p> At that point I'll have      planted everything but my squash, cucumbers, and pumpkins.      Again, I don't bother to rake out rows for these. I just      walk across the garden and drop the seeds about every 12      inches, right on the top of the soil . . . then stand off      to see whether they're approximately where I want them, and      return to push each one into the earth with my index      finger. </p><p>And, with that, the garden is planted. The entire      job doesn't take more than two hours, and can be      accomplished easily in an evening after work.			</p>			<h3>			 A FEW ADDITIONS			 </h3>			 <p>			  Now, let's see just what that couple of      hours of labor has accomplished. Besides my 300 onions I      plant about 200 beet, 200 bean, and 250 corn seeds . . .      plus 18 tomato, 6 pepper, and a total of 36 pumpkin,      squash, and cucumber plants. (Different vegetables could be      substituted, of course, but my family likes these, and I've      come to rely on specific varieties that grow well in our      area.)</p><p> During the late winter my wife usually starts some      punch-and-grow marigolds, which-come spring-are      transplanted into the finished garden's borders. Besides      helping to keep the insects in check, they provide color      clear into November. </p><p>After my crops are sown, I drive a 7'      piece of pipe into the middle of the plot . . . tie my      water sprinkler to its top . . . and connect the hose. This      setup allows the waterer to cover all the rows from its      central location, clearing the corn (which, last year,      reached 9'6") later in the season. As soon as the      sprinkler's in place, I give the garden a good initial soak      to set the seeds to germinating.</p><p> For the next 30 days or      so, I don't do anything to the plot except turn on the      water when it's needed (an inexpensive plastic rain gauge      helps me make sure that the crops get at least half an      inch-ideally, one inch-of water each week) and      watch the garden grow. Then, around the first of June, I      weed the whole thing and-in the process-remove      one of every two cornstalks and two of every three      cucumbers, pumpkins, and squash . . always saving the ones      that appear to be the hardiest.</p><p> Once that hoeing is      finished, I mulch the tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers,      and pumpkins with hay. Next, I gather up some old ladders      (picked up at the local dump) to which I've attached legs      and place them-horizontally-over the tomatoes.      I've never found anything less expensive or easier to use      to support these plants, and it takes about five minutes to      put the ladders out each spring and the same to pick them      up in November (they store very nicely against a tree all      winter, too).</p><p> My next step is to place some blood meal      (it's available at any garden shop) every two feet or so      along the edges of the garden, by tying two or three      spoonfuls into each of a number of small cloth bags and      fastening these to the V-shaped wire wickets that I use to      designate the rows. (Such wickets are an improvement over      wooden stakes, as they push into the ground more easily,      don't deteriorate, and can be hung over a nail-inside      or outside-for winter storage.) </p><p>Despite the fact that      I live within 100 feet of a large wooded area teeming with      wildlife, I've never had any crittercaused crop damage      since I began using blood meal in this manner. Often, at      night, we actually see deer grazing in the yard, and      raccoons and skunks also show up regularly . . . but the      animals never enter the unfenced garden. I replace the      natural deterrent monthly, and sprinkle the old meal from      the wicket bags over those plants (young corn, for      instance) that are most susceptible to attack by wild      nibblers.			</p>			<h3>			MINIMUM UPKEEP			</h3>			<p>			Within 45 to 60 days after planting, most of my beans and beets will      already have been eaten, canned, or frozen. In their place      I put in a row of winter squash . . . again, just pushing      the seeds into the soil with my index finger.</p><p> I've found      that onions will tolerate a few weeds in their rows, but my      tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, pumpkins, and squash don't      have to face such intrusions because they're mulched. So      hoeing takes up only about 15 minutes every two weeks . . .      usually just before dark to avoid both bugs and heat. Other      than that-and, of course, the pleasant task of      picking the fruits of my labor-my garden chores are      over after the first of June!</p><p> My records indicate that I      invested $24.75 and 7-1/2 hours of work in my garden last      year. And by planting close, mulching, and sticking to      vegetables that are sure producers, I harvest as much from      my compact eight-hour garden as some folks get from plots      twice the size.    </p>
