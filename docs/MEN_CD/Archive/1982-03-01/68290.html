            		<p><strong>After grow-testing this year's seed introductions, MOM's crop evaluator brings you . . .</strong>    </p>    		<hr />                            <h3>       Brent Elswick    </h3>    <p>      I sometimes think that gardening years tend to alternate      between good and bad. After the rainy disaster of 1979, our      Kentucky valley had a nearly perfect growing season in      1980. So I probably should have known that last year would      be something less than ideal. Sure enough, the extremely      dry conditions of 1981 weren't exactly hospitable to such      moisture-loving vegetables as cabbage, peas, and potatoes      ... but there were a few pleasant surprises even in those      categories. And last summer's arid weather was just perfect      for many other crops, especially tomatoes and melons (I've      never seen a finer year for growing either one).     </p>		 <h3>		 EARLY TRYOUTS		 </h3>		 <p>		 However, let's start at the beginning. I opened my garden test trials early last      spring-as I usually do-with the first plantings      of lettuce. While old standbys like BlackSeeded Simpson and      Salad Bowl proved their worth, as always, a couple of new      stars appeared on the horizon, as well. Crispy Sweet      lettuce from George W. Park is as delicious as its name      implies . . . and it stays good-tasting much longer than      you might expect! Another new green of note is Midget Leaf      by the McFayden Seed Company of Canada. This      north-of-theborder supplier is known for its shortseason      varieties . . . and Midget Leaf is truly one of the best.      The tiny, rosette-grouped leaves are an absolute      lettuce-lover's delight . .. and since Midget Leaf matures      in only 42 days, it's a natural planting partner for Crispy      Sweet. You can sow the Canadian variety for your early      crop, and then add a few rows of Crispy Sweet to guarantee      yourself tasty eating well into the summer.</p><p> During the      early weeks of the season, 1981 promised to be one of the      greatest years ever for peas .. . but then the dry spell      set in! Despite the hostile conditions, however, several      varieties proved worthy of further trial. In particular,      the Green Sugar snow pea (Vermont Bean Seed Company) has      about as many good characteristics as I've ever seen. Green      Sugar is a sturdy, short plant . . . and it has excellent      resistance to yellows (the dread disease that has struck      down many a good pea crop in these parts). A second      "winner" snow pea being offered for the first time in 1982      is Dwarf Sugar, from Farmer Seed & Nursery. This      variety, an update of the old Dwarf Gray Sugar, is much      tastier-and a more cooperative producer-than is      its predecessor. Its very short vines yield an abundant      crop of tender snow peas, although some folks do find the      relatively dark color of the seeds objectionable.</p><p> My '81      garden trials also uncovered several varieties of standard      garden peas that hold promise. Burpee Seed Company-as      usual-has a fine new cultivar to offer. This year's      introduction is called Grenadier, and it's a truly      remarkable pea. The mediumheight plants sport extra-long      pods that are literally crammed with plump, sugar-sweet      peas. Other fine new varieties include Joff from Unwins,      Novella from Park (and other suppliers), Supersweet from      Canada's T & T Seeds, Sounder from Rogers Brothers,      Kosta from Vermont Bean, and Aldot from Farmer Seed &      Nursery. The last variety is particularly attractive: It      sprouts into almost midgetsized plants (making it a good      choice for gardeners with limited space) . . . and it's a      darned prolific producer of tasty small peas!			</p>			<h3>			FROM THE CABBAGE PATCH			</h3>			<p>			Kentucky's typically cool, damp spring weather is quite conducive to cabbage cultivation      ... but last year, of course, wasn't typical at all! Most      of the varieties I tested didn't get a fair trial under the      unusually hot, dry conditions, and cabbage became my major      disappointment of 1981. A few seeds, however, did fairly      well against the odds . . . and those are worthy of note.</p><p>      Two entries from Stokes Seeds-Canada Kraut and      Superslaw-proved to be real survivors. The Canada      Kraut grew vigorously and yielded tender, three- to      fourpound heads. Superslaw, a laterappearing ballhead type,      made a tasty slaw, and kept right on producing clear into      the late fall! Another triumphant variety was Hercules (by      Gurney Seed & Nursery), which grew into excellent five-      to six-pound heads. Two final cultivars, Erdene from Sluis      & Groot and Prizetaker from Midwest Seeds, each      developed delicious three- to four-pound heads . . . and I      intend to give both varieties another try this summer.</p><p>      Before we leave the Cole crops, let's take a look at some      of the other family members I was able to test last season.      The most exciting new broccoli seed comes from Sluis &      Groot, a little-known (at least in the U.S.) Dutch firm      that's only recently begun offering fine European varieties      to American gardeners. S & G's 1 Hybrid broccoli is a      truly remarkable vegetable that begins to head early and      keeps right on producing tender, succulent shoots as long      as it's regularly harvested. Another noteworthy broccoli      for '82 is Southern Cross from Alberta Seeds. Despite the      fact that it was developed in Canada, it grows especially      well in warm climes . . . so you southern gardeners who      have had trouble raising broccoli might like to try this      hybrid.</p><p> While brussels sprouts aren't everybody's favorite,      a good many folks are fond of the taste of the      "mini-cabbages". One of the best new arrivals this year is      Prince Marvel from Otis Twilley (a leader in the      introduction of good new seeds). If you plant Prince Marvel      either very early or very late in the season-and keep      it weedfree, watered, and fertilized-this variety      will reward you with astounding quantities of toothsome      vegetables. As for cauliflower, I didn't find any new      varieties to match last year's Contessa (Twilley), but I      was impressed with Tornado (Sluis & Groot) and Early      Snowball (Burpee). Each is quite dependable, especially if      planted fairly early in the season.			</p>			<h3>			THE ROOT OF THE MATTER			</h3>			<p>			After the lettuce, peas, and cole vegetables are planted, I turn my attention to the root      crops. And, of those, carrots and beets are my family's      favorites.</p><p> Burpee's new carrot offering, Short-N-Sweet,      deserves the attention of all serious gardeners. It's a      stocky Chantenay type that will grow-and produce up a      storm-just about anywhere ... even in hard clay soils      (where it's usually difficult to coax carrots into      production). Short-N-Sweet has a fresh, crunchy texture      that most folks will love. Of course, the Chantenay hasn't      yet been developed that can equal the quality of the Nantes      types, and one of those "supercarrots" this year is Nandor      (by Park). This beauty grows energetically, tastes superb,      and has a lovely deep color.</p><p> Other fine new carrots include      Trophy (a long variety from Joseph Harris & Company),      Bunny Bite (a miniature from Seedway), and Red Elephant      (offered by the Abundant Life Seed Foundation). Red      Elephant is a large vegetable that is indeed almost red in      color, and of surprisingly good quality for such a hefty      variety.</p><p> Most people who plant beets tend to stick to the      old standby Detroit types . . . but many of the newer      cultivars certainly deserve a try. For instance, a 1982      introduction from Agway Seeds has to rate as one of the      sweetest-tasting beets on the market. It's called Honeyred,      and it truly is a honey of a beet! Another notable variety      is Firechief (a Ferry-Morse development that's offered in      the Seedway catalog, among others), which has short tops,      is an excellent buncher, and produced magnificently in my      parched garden plot. And if you tend to favor pickled      beets, try either Sweetheart from Farmer's or Baby Badger      from Henry Field & Company. (The latter is fairly      small, so it's a wise choice if you're tight on garden      space.)			</p>			<h3>			GOOD NEWS FOR TOMATO LOVERS			</h3>			<p>As I mentioned earlier, last year's semidrought conditions      actually benefited a few crops ... and tomatoes really      prospered! I could list a goodly number of new varieties      that performed well (I must have tried 35 to 40 different      types of seeds, and every one of them scored high), but two      stood out, even among that stellar crowd.</p><p> Cherry Grande is      a superb miniature tomato developed by Petoseed, one of      North America's leading producers of new vegetable      varieties for both home gardeners and professional      horticulturists. The Grande develops fruits a little larger      than normal cherry tomatoes ... and its tall,      semideterminant vines resist almost all major diseases. In      addition, the fruits' luscious red color makes them a      favorite for preserving (even with my wife, who's a choosy      canner, to say the least).</p><p> Sharing top honors with Cherry      Grande is Freedom, a variety which, although not strictly      new (Abbott & Cobb has offered it for a couple of years      now), is just beginning to gain well-deserved popularity      among home gardeners for its super eating quality and hardy      bushing characteristics. The strong, determinant vines      scoff at most diseases, and your first sampling of their      large fruits (8-12 ounces each) will make you eager for      seconds. Freedom was originally developed for market      gardeners and commercial growers, but-now that it's      more widely available-it shouldn't be overlooked by      tomato-loving home gardeners.</p><p> Year after year, Stokes seems      to come up with new tomatoes that are worthy of attention .      . . and if you're a canner, you'll especially like Veepro      and Veepick. The first is great for whole packing, and the      second is hard to beat among juicing tomatoes, since it's      unusually large and easy to skin. Another Italian (or      juice) tomato that did well in my 1981 trials was      Ferry-Morse's Napoli. This variety doesn't produce huge      fruits-as does Veepick, for example-but you can      expect to harvest absolutely astounding quantities from it.</p><p>      Those of you who live in areas with short growing seasons      ought to give Mighty Boy (from Alberta Seeds) a try. It      can't actually rival Freedom, but it is far and away the      best of the early tomatoes I tested last year. In fact, I      found it hard to believe that such a small plant could grow      so many large (sixto eight-ounce) fruits! One of the new      season's better open-pol linated early 'maters is      Highlander from D.V. Burrell, a reputable company that      offers a large selection of high-quality, fresh seed. The      extremely early plant produces loads of flavorful fruits,      and should do so under almost any reasonable growing      conditions.</p><p> Other new-or pretty much      unknown-tomato varieties worth investigating include      Early Pick (Burpee), Nematex and Summertime (Porter &      Sons Seedsmen), Sunlight Pole (Willhite Seed Farms), and      Jumbo Jim and SuperRed (Agway). If your tomato cultivation      area is limited to a patio or tiny backyard patch, try      Toyboy (Wyatt-Quarles) or Sugar Lump (J.W. Jung): Each      produces oodles of small, sweet fruits on sturdy little      plants. 			</p>			<h3>			PEPPERS AND EGGPLANT			</h3>			<p>			 Not many seed houses brought out new varieties of peppers and eggplant      this year, but a few of those scarce introductions are      worth mentioning. Farmer's now offers a dependable pepper      called Wisconsin Lakes, a thick-walled lovely that's just      right for salads or stuffing. Other promising pepper      newcomers are Valley Giant from Twilley . . . Park Pot from      Park (it's very dwarf, but also very productive) . . . and      New Ace from Abbott & Cobb.</p><p> Among eggplant varieties,      you'll do well to look into H.G. Hastings' Purple      Thornless, which is especially suited to warm southern      climates .. . and Pick-Me-Quick (from Unwins), an      exceptionally good vegetable that matures much more rapidly      than does the average eggplant.			</p>			<h3>			CORN . . . SWEET AND ABUNDANT			</h3>			<p>			After tomatoes, sweet corn is probably the best-loved home garden vegetable . . . and      it's my favorite! Last year's dry weather really agreed      with my corn crop, too, resulting in a banner season for      the scrumptious summer treat. The very best corn I tested      in 1981 was Sensation 95 from Hastings. Although the      cultivar takes a full three months to mature, the harvest      of nineto ten-inch-long ears is well worth the wait. Don't      miss this one!</p><p> Another long-eared breed of considerable      merit is Seneca Scout, available from many seed houses      (including Twilley). The Scout matures a week or so ahead      of 95, but its quality doesn't suffer one bit for the      shorter season. I was also impressed by Mainliner, a      superior mainseason corn sold by both Bu rpee and Midwest.</p><p>      If you have a particularly insistent sweet tooth, you'll be      pleased to learn that there are several good new types of      supersweet corn for you to choose from. Twilley's      Dinnertime is one of the best: Its large ears are      well-filled and have memorable flavor . . . as does Park's      Butterfruit, which develops somewhat smaller ears than      Dinnertime, but is ready for harvest a few days earlier.      Another fine new supersweet is Earligrow from Burrell, a      tasty cultivar that matures in about 68 days.</p><p> While      conducting my '81 trials, I also found quite a few early      corn varieties of note. Earligem (from Stokes) matures in      only 60 days, and has excellent eating quality. Other      contenders include Early Prince from T & T . . .      Starbrite (top-notch seed from Farmer that matures in about      two months) . . . Beacon from McFayden . . . Early Star      from Midwest . . . and Debut from Rogers (which does well      when planted early in still-cold soil).</p><p> Many gardeners are      now branching out to try bicolor sweet corn . . . and I can      recommend several types in this category. Herbst Brothers      score high with BiHerbst, a 75-day grain that's as pretty      to look at as it is delicious to eat! Each ear is covered      with bright green husks tinged with red, and the corn's      taste is equal to that of any of the lateyielding      varieties. Twilley's Seneca Pinto matures quite late, but      produces long and dependably sweet ears. Another great new      bicolor corn is Calypso from Rogers . . . and since its      harvest dates are right between those of the other two I've      just mentioned, you could plant all three kinds to enjoy      delightful (and colorful) eating over an extended season.</p><p> I      didn't find nearly as many good new white corn varieties in      this test series as I have in the past. However, Seedway      did introduce Crystal Delight . . . a crop that matures      much earlier than other high-quality standard "albinos" and      even before Platinum Lady (Meyer Seeds). You may remember      that I previewed that toothsome delight in last year's      garden report (which appeared in MOTHER NO. 68, page 118),      but it performed so well once again this year that I feel      it deserves a little more attention. No one who's had the      pleasure of biting into the tender, sweet kernels of an ear      of Platinum Lady can deny its superlative quality. In fact,      I believe that this cultivar is the first actual rival of      that venerable mainstay, Silver Queen.</p><p> To round out the      list, here are a few more excellent varieties of sweet corn      that I discovered this year: Big Jim (an 85-day cultivar      from Ontario Seeds), Banner (Rogers Brothers' new      main-season crop), Seneca Sentry (another winner from      Twilley), Pennfresh ADX (a fine supersweet from Agway),      Pearls & Gold (a sweet bicolor from L.L. Olds Seed      Company), and Burgundy Delight (Seedway's great-tasting      bicolor).			</p>			<h3>			CUCUMBERS . . . COOL AND CRISP			</h3>			<p>			Our family always looks forward to summer's first      fresh-from-the-garden cucumber, and during the 1981 season      that honor went to Northern Pickling from Johnny's Selected      Seeds. Furthermore, the little vine just kept on producing      tasty cukes well into the dog days . . . and we decided it      was one of the top nonhybrid picklers we've ever grown.</p><p> The      very best hybrid cuke I've seen in a long while, though, is      new from Harris: Medalist, as it's called, grows eight- to      nineinch fruits that seem almost impervious to disease, and      are absolutely unbeatable for slicing into a cool summer      salad. The other outstanding cucumber in my 1981 trials was      Amira by Park. While not as tough against the wilts as is      Medalist, this Mediterranean variety does hold its own ...      producing six- to eight-inch fruits that area delight to      eat, skin and all.</p><p> And aside from those hands-down winners,      there were a few other cukes that pleased us mightily last      year. The list includes Bush Champion by Burpee and Park      Whopper by Park (both super vegetables with compact vines)      . . . Earlipik by Alberta (a prolific pickler) . . .      Bushcrop (another fine midget from Jung) . . . and OSC      Hybrid Cuke (a really superior slicer from Ontario).    </p>		<h3> 		BETTER BEANS THAN BEFORE		</h3>		<p>		Last year wasn't a particularly good one for green beans, but a few new      introductions did manage to stick it out. If you like the      long-popular Blue Lake beans, you'll probably also enjoy      Gator Green from Meyer Seeds, which is an excellent      producer of plump, dark green pods. Burly (Rogers) is the      type to grow when faced with less than ideal conditions,      since it'll produce almost anywhere (although-while      it certainly is tasty-it isn't quite up to Gator's      standards).</p><p> Still another bush bean worth noting is known      as Exp. 121, a not yet named introduction from Gurney. This      new one is great for canning and eating fresh (as are      Bestcrop from Vermont and Greenway from Agway). Unique      among the Romano types is Harris's Green Ruler, a bush      version that's hard to beat. If you'd like to raise a      dry-shell bean (for baked beans, soup, or shelf storage),      try Peregion from Abundant Life. I've never seen a more      productive dry-shell, and its mottled black seeds are      lovely.</p><p> Despite 1981's adverse growing conditions, I was      also able to pinpoint some fine new pole beans for '82. The      best of the bunch is probably Selma Star from Park. Each      long, handsome pod makes fine eating, and the Star is      actually supe rior to such older poles as Kentucky Wonder.      Another '82 newcomer, Blue Ribbon from Vermont, somewhat      resembles the famed White Half Runner ... but it doesn't      have quite the same quality as does that old southern      favorite. The seeds are also a bit dark, a fact that will      make the bean undesirable as a canner for many folks.      However, Blue Ribbon does appear to be a durable variety      that can be counted on to produce steadily, even in bad      crop years. The last pole bean of note is Dade from      Hastings. Although it isn't officially anew variety, this      McCaslan type is all but unknown outside of its native      South ... but it's sure to please any gardener who likes      the strong taste of pole beans.			</p>			<h3> 			SQUASH FOR ALL      SEASONS			</h3>			<p> 			There are a number of fine new varieties      of squash for 1982, both summer and winter. Kuta from Park      is probably destined to be the most famous of the lot. This      combination vegetable can be cooked like a summer crookneck      if it's picked when immature, or baked like a winter squash      (or even a pumpkin) if it's harvested late in the season.      Another "crossover" is Table Gold from Twilley: Fry it up      like a tender summer squash or prepare it, later in the      season, as you would an acorn or butternut. Special among      the summer types of squash are Multipik from Harris and      Dixie from Hastings, both of which offer medium-sized      yellow fruits. Black Magic from Park, another sure bet, is      a fine black zucchini . . . one of the best you'll find in      any seed catalog.</p><p> If you favor winter squash, I have a      goody to recommend this year ... although it's actually a      holdover from the 1980 trials. Although Melon squash was      featured in last year's report, I must sing its praises      once again! The fact is, I suspect this could very well be      the greatest winter squash yet developed . . . if not one      of the best vegetable varieties ever! The huge 20- to      30pound fruits contain lipsmackingly sweet flesh, and I      think any gardener who passes up this incredible cultivar      is doing him- or herself an injustice. Although Thompson      & Morgan had nearly run out of the seed at the time my      article appeared last year (the firm made MOTHER-readers a      special offer on the remaining stock), Melon squash is now      available from several other companies . .. in addition to      being offered again by Thompson & Morgan.</p>			<h3>			IN      THE GOOD OLD MELONTIME			</h3>			<p>			 Now we come to the real      stars of last year's trials . . . the melons. I'm sure most      gardeners would agree that no midsummer meal is quite      complete without a dessert of sweet, cold melon . . . and I      can recommend some dandies for your '82 patch. First of      all, I'd be hard pressed to imagine a cantaloupe that's any      better than Chieftain (from Henry Field). This disease- and      pest-resistant cultivar is a nearly foolproof grower . . .      and each six- to eightpound fruit is chock-full of rich,      orange goodness.</p><p> Twilley's Early Crenshaw is another      worthwhile addition to any melon-fancier's garden. Although      its season is about seven to ten days longer than that of      most midseason varieties, Early Crenshaw is definitely      worth the wait. The color and flavor of its flesh lie      somewhere between those of cantaloupe and honeydew ... and      you'll find that 12- to 14-pound fruits aren't at all      unusual. I also liked the new cantaloupe from Harris,      called Superstar, which consistently produced extra-large      fruits of high quality.</p><p> One of the most unusual melons I      tried was Valencia (Herbst). If you have a long growing      season, you ought to try this strange fruit. It's large and      green and wrinkled, yet offers flavorful white flesh that's      a little like that of a honeydew. Other notable cantaloupes      tested in the '81 trials were Honeyloupe, a cross offered      by Twilley and others . . . Gurney Giant, a superlarge and      super-tasty variety ... and Short-N-Sweet, a nice midget      from Park.</p><p> Watermelons grew well in '81, too, and I found      several especially good ones among the relatively few new      offerings. The best was probably North Carolina Giant, from      Wyatt-Quarles. This large variety was originally developed      as an outsized "first prize at the county fair" type, but I      suspect it'll soon catch on among many home gardeners who      mark the arrival of full summer by harvesting the first      sweet melon. Another tasty introduction is Chubby Gray from      Willhite (a scaleddown version of the well-loved Charleston      Gray), which never seems to stop producing great-tasting      melons. Park's Whopper is also a real treat, particularly      for folks who like a smaller icebox variety. Other good      choices for this year are Summit by Willhite and Blackstone      by Burrell, two Black Diamond types that produce 20- to      25-pound fruits.			</p>			<h3>			THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE			</h3>			<p>			Finally, if I haven't yet worn out your back-or your      gardening tools-there are still a few more standouts      I simply must mention! I was particularly delighted with      the results I received from the Belrus potato (L.L. Olds),      the Royal Globe turnip (Twilley), and the Lee okra      (Hattings).</p><p> Among the new strawberries, I found that      Royalty from Burpee is appropriately named ... as is      Earliglow, an excellent early berry sold by Allen. And from      Walter K. Morse Company comes Honeyoye, which has to be one      of the finest all-purpose varieties ever developed . . .      its luscious, dark red berries taste so sweet that you'll      swear they're laced with honey.</p><p> Well, I hope my 198      garden-testing report has inspired you to do some serious      sowing this spring.
