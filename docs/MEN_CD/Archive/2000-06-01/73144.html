                          <p>      Critics of industrial pollution have long been held at bay      with the argument that what's good for the environment is      bad for business. Enter the Environmental Sustainability      Index (ESI), a statistical tool that just may end the      debate over the negative effects of environmental standards      on economic growth. Developed by the Yale Center for      Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP) and the Columbia      University Center for International Earth Science      Information Network (CIESIN), the ESI promises to      significantly influence environmental public policy      worldwide.    </p>    <p>      "There are some people," says CIESIN project team leader      Marc Levy, "who would argue that you either get rich or get      clean. With the index, we've ruled this out. It's just not      true that as the environment improves the economy suffers."      Indeed, the index reveals that countries with strict      environmental protections often have high economic growth,      although Levy points out that without further research,      "correlation does not prove causation."<br />    </p>    <p>      The ESI compares 56 countries around the world in terms of      five basic components: the status of the current ecosystem;      the stresses on that system; the effects of changes in the      ecosystem on people and society; the political framework in      a country that enables it to respond to environmental      challenges; and the degree to which a country cooperates      with other countries to reduce environmental impact. These      components are then broken down into 64 specific variables      - such as percentage of energy drawn from alternative power      sources and number of threatened species - in order to      determine a country's overall ESI value.    </p>    <p>      Proponents of the ESI would like to see it serve as an      annual benchmark for measuring trends. "Currently      environmental policy initiatives aren't grounded in data      and facts," says Levy, "and we suffer as a consequence.      People want to put their efforts where it matters most, but      until now it's been just guesswork."    </p>    <p>      By eliminating much of the uncertainty in policy-making,the      report may both highlight the need and clear the way for      real reform, while underscoring the fact that a stable      economy requires the careful management of all of a      country's resources, not least of all the environment.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Peter Carter</em>    </p>
