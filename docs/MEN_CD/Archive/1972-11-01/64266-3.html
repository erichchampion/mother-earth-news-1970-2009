        Fall pea plants that blossom before first frost are extremely resistant to damage. Severe frosts, however, will reduce or stop pod production and freeze developed peas. Lettuce and cabbage are unaffected by light and medium frosts and grow superbly during cool fall weather. Radishes, turnips, beets, carrots and chard grow as well in autumn as in spring. Parsnips and salsify should be planted in early spring for early winter harvests.
