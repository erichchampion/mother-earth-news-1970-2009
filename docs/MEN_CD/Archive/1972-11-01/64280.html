                        <p>      <strong>Bean Soop</strong>    </p>    <p>      This Bean Soop is<br />      Rich, High in Protein<br />      Cheap, Meatless, and Made in 1 Hour<br />      Take:    </p>    <p>      1 cup dried split peas<br />      1 cup lentils<br />      1 cup baby limas<br />      1 cup blackeyed peas<br />      1 cloved garlic chopped... fine    </p>    <p>      Cover with plenty of salted water & boil 45 minutes.    </p>    <p>      While beans are boiling Dice:    </p>    <p>      1 large potato<br />      1 large white onion<br />      2 stalks celery<br />      3 carrots    </p>    <p>      After the beans have boiled 45 min. Add vegetables, also      soy sauce, and/or Teriyaki sauce to taste. Bring back to      Boil. Boil for 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Play around with it!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Match Scratches on Walls</strong> Some menfolk are      careless in scratching matches at any handy place to light      their pipes or cigar (or joints) To keep your walls or      mantle pieces from being marked up, take a piece of 4" x 6"      sand paper, frame it neatly, and hang it to the wall in a      handy place.    </p>    <h3>CANDLE CARE</h3>    <p>      Candles improve by keeping a few months. The most      economical as well as the most convenient plan is to      purchase them by the box,    </p>    <p>      IF WAX CANDLES BECOME DISCOLORED OR SOILED, they may be      restored by rubbing them with a clean flannel slightly      dipped in alcohol.    </p>    <p>      CANDLES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO LIGHT. they will however,      ignite instantly if, when preparing them for evening, you      dip the wicks in alcohol shortly before they are wanted.    </p>    <p>      ALWAYS LIGHT A CANDLE WITH A MATCH and do not hold it to      the fire as that will cause the top to melt. Always hold      the match to the side of the wick.    </p>    <p>      IF YOU FIND THE CANDLE TOO SMALL for your candlestick, just      wrap a small piece of white paper around the bottom of the      candle, but do not allow the paper to appear above the      socket.    </p>    <p>      ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT A CANDLE BURNS AS IT IS LIT. Therefore      always trim a wick to a convenient length for lightning,      which means that it should be trimmed close. If the wick is      too long, it will have a tendency to drop over and set the      candle to running.    </p>    <p>      CANDLES LOOK & BURN BETTER IF YOU VARNISH THEM WITH      SHELLAC.    </p>    <p>      GLASS RECEIVERS for the droppings of candles are very      convenient as well as ornamental. THE PIECES of CANDLE THAT      are left each morning should be placed in a tin box. Kept      for that purpose against emergencies and other uses.    </p>        <p>      Original recipe submitted by Nancy Kirk (Seattle)<br />      1 slice Wheat Berry bread (or other whole wheat      bread)<br />      1 T. Chia seeds<br />      Several thin slices of a light cheese (Monterey Jack is      good)<br />      Several chopped walnuts    </p>    <p>      Toast cheese and bread, remove and place nuts and seeds      firmly in cheese. This sandwich is high in protein and B      vitamins, thus yielding god energy. Milk is an excellent      beverage with this.    </p>            <div class="sidebar">    <h3>CHINESE STYLE SPROUTS</h3>    <p>      Heat some sesame oil in a large skillet, saute some green      onions for a minute or 2 then throw in fresh bean sprouts      and stir fry (quickly with super-hot heat) for just a      minute. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if you wish, or 1/2 t.      of fresh ground ginger. Good vitamin-rich, nutritional      dish!    </p>    <p>      Cindy Roberts    </p>    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/018-065-01c.gif" alt="018-065-01c.gif" width="320" height="602" />    </div>    </div>    <p>      This double page taken from NORTHWEST PASSAGE, a      fortnightly journal of ecology, politics, the arts and good      healthy livin.' We've recommended NP before and we're doing      it again. Get yers for $6.00 ($6.75 Canadian, $7.50      foreign) from 1000 Harris St., Bellingham, Wash. 98225.    </p>    <p>      Ice cream is one of the quickest and easiest of all      desserts to make outdoors, esp. after a fresh snow. Best      for the purpose are dry snow flakes. You can also use the      granular interior of the perpetual snowbanks found in the      higher mountains, although the results will be more a      course sherbet.    </p>    <p>      Just empty a can of evaporated milk into a large pot or      bowl. A similar amt of dry milk, reconstituted with water      will do as well. Add 2 tablespoons of sugar (by which we      know he means raw sugar or honey) 1/8 teaspoon salt, and      some flavoring. Vanilla, or one of the other extracts will      serve. so will cocoa, powdered instant coffee, with 1 tsp      chocolate: enough, incidentally for 1 quart of ice cream.      If the flavoring is for instance chocolate syrup, which is      already sweet, just omit sugar (but not the honey, nuts,      seeds berries, fruit, or whatever else grows wild or can be      liberated locally.)    </p>    <p>      Then quickly stir in fresh snow to taste. More sweetening      and flavoring may be added if you want. For this reason      it's safest to go light ((always)) on these intially.      Otherwise you'll have to repair any mistake with more snow      and milk-not that that isn't a good      excuse-Vanilla, rich dark chocolate with overtones of      pepper mint extract, and banana (extract) ice cream are all      extra-scrumptious.    </p>    <p>      The esquimoux have been delighting esquimoux children      (their favorite pasttime) since longer that anyone can      remember by chopping up (fish, mammal, or, why not soy oil)      with the snow and sweet berries. REAL ice cream.    </p>    <p>      Lew Hailey<br />      Palo Alto, Calif.    </p>    <h3><em>ACHES AND PAINS</em></h3>    <p>      FROM A FELLER RAISED IN NORTHERN IDAHO, HERE'S A SUREFIRE      CURE FOR SORE MUSCLES:    </p>    <p>      MIX TOGETHER:    </p>    <p>      1 pint rubbing alcohol<br />      1 or 1 1/2 oil of wintergreen<br />      10 or 12 aspirin<br />      Dont rub any longer than necessary, cause the longer you      rub, the hotter and hotter it gets. Good for aches and      pains & arthritis (He says)    </p>    <h3>      FROZEN PIPES?... DON'T PANIC    </h3>    <p>      To clear a frozen drainpipe-if it is not safe to      build a small fire on the ground near the frozen pipe,      sprinkle quicklime on the ground, moisten it, and cover,      The heat generated by the lime does the trick    </p>
