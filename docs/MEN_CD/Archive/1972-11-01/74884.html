                    <h5 id="byline">      By MIKE KIERNAN    </h5>    <h3>      THE ENERGY REPORT    </h3>    <p>      <em>Stop the manufacture of inefficient electric      appliances. Require that all new buildings be fully      insulated. Prohibit the sale of inefficient air      conditioners. Require that intercity freight be moved by      rail. Shift intercity passengers from air to ground travel      and urban passengers from automobiles to mass transit.      Compel industry to upgrade its processes and equipment. And      finally, to get the job done, levy an energy tax.</em>    </p>    <p>      The above may sound like a rallying cry for environmental      activists, but it's actually a summary of numerous      suggestions made in an energy report that the Nixon      administration quietly made public last month.    </p>    <p>      Coming as it does at a time when industry is waging a      massive ad campaign to convince the public that only the      rapid development of new sources of fuel can save the      nation from an impending energy crisis, the report is      potentially embarrassing because it offers another      alternative: the rational management of energy use.    </p>    <p>      Huge amounts of energy, now wasted, can be conserved . . .      as much as the equivalent of 7.3 million barrels of crude      oil daily by the year 1980. This is equal to about      two-thirds of the projected oil imports for that year. In      cash, it means a savings of $10.7 billion annually.    </p>    <p>      "We recognize that our analysis is not complete and that      many of the measures we suggest may ultimately prove      unacceptable," says Bob Kupperman, chairman of the 11-man      team which wrote the study. "But even if we realized only      half or a third of the savings we feel is possible, it      would still help mightily in managing the energy crisis."    </p>    <p>      The President himself has said nothing of the report, and      Kupperman stresses that it is not a policy-making study.      "We are only making suggestions," he says. Still, even      those who are highly critical of Nixon's energy policies      have told MOTHER the paper is a "hopeful, if cursory, first      step" in turning America around on the energy question.    </p>    <p>      "There is nothing new or earth shattering here," said      Wilson Clark, who has studied energy problems for Friends      of the Earth and other environmental groups. "We've been      saying it all along. What's significant is that now the      government is agreeing with us that we can all live on less      energy and still preserve the same standard of living."    </p>    <p>      In homes and businesses, the proposal that would lead to      the largest energy savings is improved insulation. Within a      decade, say the authors, proper insulation and construction      practices could reduce space heating and cooling      requirements by 20 percent . . . a savings of two      quadrillion BTU's a year.    </p>    <p>      Among other suggestions:    </p>    <p>      Energy consumption of each gas and electric appliance      should be stated on the nameplate, on the price tag and in      every advertisement in which the selling price is      mentioned.    </p>    <p>      Inefficient air conditioning units should be banned. Today      the worst air conditioners draw about twice the amount of      electricity drawn by the best for equivalent cooling.    </p>    <p>      Fluorescent lamps should replace incandescent bulbs.      Fluorescent lamps are three times more efficient and an      inexpensive compact fluorescent bulb should be developed to      fit into a common mazda socket.    </p>    <p>      The energy report's most controversial and important      suggestions center on the transportation sector of our      society. The government, says the study, must champion the      idea of mass transit. In the paper's words, government must      "stimulate the development of sufficiently fast, safe,      inexpensive, comfortable, convenient and reliable mass      transit systems to draw passengers away from automobiles      and airplanes." The study recommends that the use of the      automobile should be further discour aged by parking and      road tolls, priority bus lanes and traffic control.    </p>    <p>      In effect, then, the report calls on the President and      Congress to reverse current policy that favors transport by      car and airplane . . . and it points up an often ignored      contradiction that exists between efforts to conserve fuel      on the one hand and reduce automobile pollution on the      other.<br />    </p>    <p>      If auto emission standards are enforced, reason the      authors, less fuel will be conserved. The answer: develop      electric vehicles that operate on coal or nuclear power      rather than petroleum. In this way, the United States'      diminishing reserves of oil can be preserved.    </p>    <p>      Hard hitting as it is, the recently released energy study      shies away from detailing the abuses of industry and      utilities in the same way it takes on the transportation      interest. No doubt the authors decided that the auto,      trucking, highway and oil interest were challenge enough      for this small study.    </p>    <p>      Finally, granted that huge savings are possible, are they      likely? The authors are realistic. "In light of the variety      of powerful special interest groups," they say, the huge      savings outlined are not likely "until a very sizable      constituency favoring decisive action" emerges.    </p>    <p>      The President, of course, is not on record encouraging a      public outcry for the conservation of energy. Last August      the paper was stamped "confidential", and there was      considerable doubt whether it would be made public. Only      when an industry newsletter, <em>Oilgram,</em> disclosed      the study's contents to its subscribers did the      administration give the go-ahead to publish . . . without      fanfare.    </p>    <p>      The report, entitled <em>THE POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY      CONSERVATION,</em> is now available for $2.00 from the      Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.    </p>    <h3>      THE NATIONAL PARKS STUDY    </h3>    <p>      When Yellowstone was named by Congress as the world's first      national park in 1872, only the hardiest pioneers had ever      really seen the place and the rest of the country was still      in the horse-and-buggy age.    </p>    <p>      Now you can't find a parking place at Old Faithful.      Yosemite Valley is hazy with air pollution. The Grand      Canyon echoes with sonic booms. Pollutants are oozing into      the Everglades. Acadia in Maine is paved over with      concrete. And the Great Smoky Mountains have such terrible      traffic jams that rangers have had to install the first      national park traffic light there.    </p>    <p>      These are some of the problems dealt with in a new paper,      <em>NATIONAL PARKS FOR THE FUTURE,</em> published by the      Conservation Foundation, a tax-exempt Washington, D.C.based      environmental group.    </p>    <p>      The Foundation undertook the study for the National Park      Service-which runs the show at the peoples'      parks-and the National Parks Centennial Commission,      created by President Nixon to celebrate the 100th      anniversary of the parks.    </p>    <p>      The report makes some pretty bold and blunt suggestions.      For starters, it recommends "an immediate moratorium on      road building, parking lots and other auto-oriented      improvements" in the national parks. If they had their      druthers, the authors say, automobiles would be banned from      every unit of the park system. Since that's not feasible      today, they suggest that the Secretary of the Interior      appoint a special commission to study the whole problem of      private cars in the parks and alternate transportation      methods. In Yosemite, for example,. an experimental program      limits the use of cars and provides propane-powered buses      to haul people around. "Automobiles can destroy our      national park heritage just as surely as they have made our      cities inhumane and dangerous to limb and lung and have      desecrated much of the metropolitan countryside," the study      concludes.    </p>    <p>      Sydney Howe, the Conservation Foundation's widely respected      president, points out that the first national park was      founded "for the benefit and enjoyment of the people". But      now enormous numbers of people-undreamed of in the      19th century-are inundating the parks and damaging      their natural qualities. Howe believes nature's wonders can      be maintained only if public use is "sensitive and      sparing". He says:    </p>    <p>      "By and large, the human numbers that now crowd the parks      will not exceed natural carrying capacities if people enter      and use their national parks <em>on nature's terms.</em> "      Howe also sees in the park system "opportunity for vast      public benefit from infusion into the nation's life of      basic environmental appreciations". How to accomplish these      lofty goals? Among the report's major recommendations:    </p>    <p>      The National Park System, which includes some 285 units      covering about 30 million acres, should reassert its      traditional role as "conservator of the timeless natural      assets of the United States" and should give people "a      distinctive recreational opportunity based on natural      values". This means get rid of the golf courses, tennis      courts, plush hotels, fancy bars, gas stations, grocery      stores, trinket shops and popcorn stands that clutter up      too many of our parks . . . and put such facilities outside      the park boundaries. More land should be designated as      wilderness under the 1964 Wilderness Act, and hunting and      fishing should be stopped or restricted.    </p>    <p>      National parks should be used as "a, showcase of man's      proper stewardship of land, water and air". Park programs      should dramatize ecological relationships, regulations      should reinforce the environmental ethic in terms of waste      disposal and care of camping areas and the National Park      Service should be an outspoken advocate of environmental      education and reform.    </p>    <p>      The Park Service should get out of the history, culture,      arts and sciences business and go back to preservation and      recreation. Such specialized programs in the parks should      be turned over to the Smithsonian Institution or the      National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities or,      maybe, a separate government agency.    </p>    <p>      A system of urban-area parks should be established within      striking distance of big cities, where most of the nation's      people live. Land could be purchased through a $100-billion      "Buy Back America" program funded by a capital gains tax on      sales of undeveloped lands and an excise tax on      recreational vehicles and equipment (like trailers,      campers, trail bikes, boats, camping gear and sporting      goods).    </p>    <p>      Wilderness preservation should be the main goal of national      parks management. Minimum facilities construction should be      the basic philosophy of park accommodations. Private      concessioners should be phased out. Primitive-area camps      should be set up to give city-dwellers a taste of the      wilderness experience.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the study is best summarized by its cover, which      shows a lovely green grove of tall, leafy trees . . . with      the jagged gray teeth of an urban skyline rising up out of      the forest floor. Fat City has come to America's      hinterland. That stark vision of tomorrow, says the study,      is one we've got to prevent.    </p>
