                <p>      <em>Here's the seventh in a series of articles that will      help you tell friend from foe in your garden.</em>    </p>        <h2 id="subtitle">      Part VII, Ladybird Beetles    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      By Ron West    </h5>        <p>      Few gardeners fail to recognize the friendly ladybird      beetle, also known as the ladybug. This fierce little      predator is one of nature's prime defenses against many      garden pests, especially aphids. The moniker      <em>ladybug</em> refers to Our Lady, the Virgin Mary, and      was gratefully bestowed upon this beetle in the Middle Ages      by farmers who realized the insect's value in ridding their      grapevines of pests. But though the ladybird's actions have      been extolled for centuries, few people really understand      the biology of this tiny benefactor ... and fewer still can      discern the ladybug's immature forms.    </p>    <p>      Of the hundreds of species of ladybird beetles (family      Coccinellidae), the most widespread and familiar is the      convergent ladybird beetle, <em>Hippodamia convergens,</em>      which is pictured here. The brilliant red color of this and      similar species is not intended to dazzle <em>human</em>      retinas but serves as a warning to predators, for the body      fluids of these beetles are quite distasteful. Red, orange,      and yellow species are most prevalent, but you might run      across black, tan, or multicolored ladybirds, as well.    </p>    <p>      Like most insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, the      ladybug begins its life as an egg. The adult female lays      clusters of these minute, bright yellow gems in crevices of      tree bark or on the undersides of protected leaves where      there's a sufficient number of prey to support the larvae.      From each egg emerges a tapered larva that's typically      charcoal gray with white, orange, or red markings and that      bears a certain resemblance to a chubby miniature      alligator.    </p>        <p>      Though the adult ladybirds are also predators, it's the      immature larvae that take the largest toll on garden pests.      Ravenous in appetite, a larva may consume as many as 40      aphids in a single hour! Other soft-bodied creatures are      also on its menu, including mealy bugs , immature scale      insects, young whiteflies, small caterpillars, and mites.      The larva-which ranges in size from 1/16" to 1/4",      depending on its maturity-completes its growth in      about 20 days, at which point it fastens itself to a leaf      or other object, hangs its head downward, and enters the      pupal stage, forming a teardrop-shaped cocoon in which the      transformation into an adult beetle takes place.    </p>    <p>      I've successfully redistributed ladybird larvae in my      garden, taking some from areas having sparse aphid      populations and placing them on more severely infested      plants. If undertaken before the aphids have a chance to      reach damaging proportions, this technique can be an      effective (and timesaving) alternative to using soap sprays      or crushing the pests by hand. Of course, adult beetles can      be relocated as well, but since they have the power of      flight at their disposal, they're not as easy to manipulate      as the wingless larvae.    </p>        <p>      Convergent ladybird beetles are found throughout North      America. The adults frequently over winter in groups,      sometimes in tremendous numbers. In the West, the beetles      migrate to mountain canyons, where literally thousands of      the insects can be found huddled together throughout the      winter. Such congregations have proved tempting to many      gardeners and have even sparked a few businesses that      harvest the masses of ladybugs and then sell them.      Unfortunately, unless the beetles have been fed a special      diet to reactivate their reproductive ability from a state      of ovarian diapause, the transplanted beetles will have an      overwhelming urge to fly off and reaggregate ... so the      benefits of importing beetles to the garden are often nil.      It's generally better to work with the existing adults and      larvae in your growing plot than to buy them elsewhere. If      you <em>do</em> purchase <em>Hippodamia</em> beetles, be      sure your stock has been "preconditioned" so they'll be      ready to feed and to lay eggs.    </p>    <p>      Every family, of course, seems to have its black sheep, and      the Coccinellidae is no exception. Two      phytophagous-or plant-feeding-species, the      Mexican bean beetle <em>(Epilachna varivestis)</em> and the      squash beetle <em>(E. borealis),</em> commonly defoliate      those plants after which they're named. You can identify      the larvae of these beetles by their fuzzy, lemon yellow      coats, as these two are the only large members of the      family to sport such attire. Although these particular      pests do inflict a considerable amount of damage both as      larvae and adults, the hundreds of <em>beneficial</em>      species in the Coccinellidae family more than compensate      for the duo's bad behavior. In my ledger, this clan's      bottom line is always in the black!    </p>
