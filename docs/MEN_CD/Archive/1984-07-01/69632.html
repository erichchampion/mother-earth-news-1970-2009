    <p>
                <p>      <em>This summer,</em> fill <em>your ice cream cone with a      tasty, nutritious, and low-calorie alternative.</em>    </p>            <p>      <em>Frozen yogurt</em> ... the tangy treat that was      practically unheard of only a few years ago is now a      summertime staple in many American kitchens. It's easy to      see why: Not only does the iced confection taste great, but      it's chock-full of protein, calcium, and healthful      lactobacillus bacteria. What's more, a serving of frozen      yogurt contains only half the calories present in an equal      portion of ice cream.    </p>    <p>      With that many nutritional pluses, it's not surprising that      frozen yogurt has achieved such phenomenal popularity in so      short a time. There's hardly a town that doesn't boast a      soft-serve" outlet ... and the product is also available in      hard-frozen form at most supermarkets. You haven't really      tasted frozen yogurt at its best, though, until you've      enjoyed some that you made yourself.    </p>    <p>      Homemade frozen yogurt is even easier to prepare than ice      cream ... it can be produced for a third the cost of the      store-bought brands ... and it lacks the stabilizers,      emulsifiers, preservatives, antioxidants, and "imitation"      ingredients that inevitably find their way into the      commercial concoctions. (In fact, you might be surprised to      know that many of the frozen yogurt products on the market      contain "dead" rather than viable bacteria, thus reducing      the health benefits of the dessert. And because regulations      for frozen yogurt have not been standardized, even the      amount of yogurt present in commercial brands varies      considerably.) And by making your own yogurt to start with      (see the accompanying sidebar), you'll be able to regulate      what goes into your dessert from the cow-or      goat-onward. Best of all, you'll be able to prepare      any flavor of frozen yogurt that you've a hankering for,      instead of limiting your taste buds to a few varieties in      your grocer's freezer.    </p>    <p>      The following recipes are some of our favorites. In most      cases, whole milk yogurt is specified because it imparts a      richer, smoother taste and texture to the dessert than does      low fat yogurt. But you can use low-fat or even nonfat      yogurt if you prefer ... though you'll probably need to add      a thickener, such as gelatin or beaten egg whites, to give      the yogurt the proper consistency. Also, because tartness      is part of the charm of frozen yogurt, these recipes call      for a minimal amount of sweetener ... and whenever      possible, natural sweeteners-such as fruit      juices-are employed. Each of the recipes makes about      a quart of frozen yogurt unless otherwise noted.    </p>    <p>      After sampling a few of these concoctions, you'll probably      want to expand your gastronomic horizons and come up with      your own taste designed favorites. Whatever variations you      devise, however, we think you'll agree that homemade frozen      yogurt makes for simply scrumptious summertime fare.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FRENCH VANILLA<br />      FROZEN YOGURT</strong>    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup of evaporated milk<br />      2 teaspoons of unflavored gelatin, softened<br />      2/3 cup of raw sugar<br />      pinch of salt<br />      2 egg yolks, beaten<br />      2 cups of plain, whole milk yogurt<br />      2 tablespoons of vanilla<br />      2 egg whites    </p>    <p>      Heat the milk to just below boiling in the top of a double      boiler. Next, add the gelatin, sugar, and salt, and stir      these ingredients until they're dissolved.    </p>    <p>      Now, beat the egg yolks until they're frothy, and blend in      a small amount of the milk mixture. Then gradually add the      yolks to the ingredients in the double boiler, stirring      constantly as you do so. Continue cooking and blending the      liquid until it begins to thicken, then set it aside. When      it's cooled to room temperature, add the yogurt and      vanilla, and chill the mixture for 1 hour in a      refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Finally, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks,      gently fold them into the chilled yogurt blend, and chum      the mixture in a standard (manual or electric) two-quart      ice cream freezer. This recipe makes a smooth, frosty      dessert with a subtle undercurrent of vanilla.    </p>    <p>      Variation: If a simpler or sugarless vanilla yogurt is what      you're after, just combine 2 cups of plain, whole milk      yogurt, 1/2 cup of honey, 1 cup of evaporated milk, and 2      tablespoons of vanilla ... chill the preparation for 2      hours . . . and churn it. It'll take only 5 minutes to make      this mix, and a few hours-and turns of the freezer      crank-later, you can reward yourself with a cool, delicious      treat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RASPBERRY FROZEN YOGURT</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 cup of fresh raspberry puree<br />      2 cups of plain, whole milk yogurt<br />      1/3 cup of honey    </p>    <p>      This is another 5-minutes-to-mix favorite. Buzz up some      raspberries in a blender, add the yogurt and honey, chill      the mixture for 2 hours, churn it, and enjoy! You can also      modify this recipe to prepare blueberry, blackberry,      strawberry, or even banana frozen yogurt.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAROB FROZEN YOGURT</strong>    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup of carob powder<br />      1/2 cup of water<br />      1/4 cup of corn syrup<br />      1/4 cup of honey<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla<br />      2-1/2 cups of plain, whole milk yogurt    </p>    <p>      The natural-foods revolution has brought with it some      winning new flavors, among them carob. Try this recipe for      a dessert that'll be sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.    </p>    <p>      Mix the carob powder and the water in a heavy enameled or      stainless steel saucepan. Then add the remaining      ingredients except the yogurt, and heat the      mixture-stirring it constantly-for 3 minutes.      Remove it from the heat, and when the carob concoction has      cooled to room temperature, add the yogurt. You'll now need      to chill the dessert-to-be for 2 hours <em>...</em> and      then churn it in a two-quart freezer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FRESH PEACH<br />      FROZEN YOGURT</strong>    </p>    <p>      1/3 cup of fresh peaches, peeled and chopped<br />      2-1/2 cups of plain, whole milk yogurt<br />      1/2 cup of raw sugar<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla    </p>    <p>      Combine all the ingredients, chill them for 2 hours, and      then churn the confection. Light, fresh, and creamy, this      frozen yogurt is bound to be one of your favorites.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HONEY-LEMON<br />      FROZEN YOGURT</strong>    </p>    <p>      2/3 cup of honey<br />      2 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />      1 teaspoon of grated lemon rind<br />      pinch of salt<br />      2 cups of plain, whole milk yogurt<br />      2 egg whites    </p>    <p>      Honey and lemon go together beautifully in frozen yogurt.      The honey gives the dessert a smooth texture and natural      sweetness, while the lemon imparts a bright snap to the      taste. To make this delightful delicacy, combine the first      four ingredients in a heavy enameled or stainless steel      saucepan over medium heat and stir them until they're well      blended. Then set the mixture aside to cool.    </p>    <p>      Next, mix in the yogurt and chill the concoction for 2      hours. Then beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form,      gently fold them into the yogurt preparation, and churn the      dessert in a two-quart freezer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DESERT OASIS<br />      FROZEN YOGURT</strong>    </p>    <p>      1/3 cup of minced dates<br />      2/3 cup of honey<br />      1/3 cup <em>of</em> evaporated milk<br />      1 tablespoon of unflavored gelatin, softened<br />      2 cups of plain, whole milk yogurt    </p>    <p>      Begin by mixing the dates and honey together. Next, heat      the milk in the top of a double boiler, add the softened      gelatin and the date-honey combination, and stir the blend      constantly until it's smooth. Then remove the ingredients      from the heat, and when they're cooled to room temperature,      add the yogurt. Finally, chill the mixture for 1 hour and      then churn it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COFFEE FROZEN YOGURT</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups of milk<br />      1-1/2 cups of raw sugar<br />      2 eggs, beaten<br />      1 cup of cold, very strong black coffee<br />      1/4 teaspoon of salt<br />      1- 1/2 cups of plain, whole milk yogurt<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla<br />      2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier or coffee-flavored liqueur,      such as Kahlua    </p>    <p>      In an enameled or stainless steel saucepan, cook the milk      over low heat, but don't allow it to boil. Then remove the      pan from the burner and add the sugar, stirring until it      dissolves. Now, gradually pour the milk mixture over the      beaten eggs, stirring constantly until the ingredients are      well blended. Next, transfer the mixture to the top of a      double boiler and cook it, stirring all the while, until      it's thick and smooth. Cool the concoction to room      temperature, then add the remaining ingredients and mix      them thoroughly. Chill the dessert-to-be for 2 hours, and      then churn it in a two-quart freezer. This recipe makes      1-1/2 quarts.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: All ofthe recipes in this article except      the Coffee Frozen Yogurt are reprinted with permission from      Cool & Creamy by Gay Hendricks and Carol Leaven worth      (copyright© 1979 Prentice-Hall, Inc., Rt. 9W,Englewood      Cliffs, NJ 07632), which is currently out of print but may      be available from your local library.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Coffee Frozen Yogurt recipe is reprinted with      permission from The Book of Yogurtby Sonia Uvezian      (published by 101 Productions, 834 Mission St., San      Francisco, CA 94103), which is available for $6.95 plus      $1.50 for postage.</em>    </p>    <h3>Make Your Own Yogurt</h3>    <p>      <em>The best frozen yogurt begins with homemade yogurt,      though of course you can buy the converted milk product.      But since homemade yogurt is so easy to prepare (and      significantly less costly than the commercial brands),      you'll probably want to create your own. That way, you can      be sure that the yogurt is fresh and contains only the      natural ingredients you put in it. You'll also be able to      select the type of milk you prefer and to control the      incubation period to produce the distinctive taste and      texture you're after.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOUR SIMPLE STEPS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Although there are all sorts of fancy yogurt-makers on      the market today, you can make a perfectly good batch of      the Middle Eastern food by using common kitchen tools.      You'll need a good-sized stainless steel or enamel pot, a      candy thermometer, glass jars with lids (jelly jars are a      good choice), and an incubation chamber (more about that      last item later).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Once you've rounded up this equipment, follow the steps      listed below. The amounts given will make 1 quart of      yogurt; to concoct more, increase the quantities      accordingly.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>[1] Preheating.</strong> In a large pot, heat I      quart of milk to 140°-150°F for 15 minutes,      stirring it frequently to prevent a skin from forming on      the surface. (You can also add 1/3 cup of nonfat dry milk      powder at this point if you desire a thicker and more      nutritious yogurt.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>[2] Inoculation.</strong> Remove the pan from the      heat and allow the milk to cool to 110'deg-20degF (112'F is      ideal). Then, in a small bowl, mix a bit of the milk with 1      to 2 tablespoons of fresh yogurt (or 1 package of dry      culture) and blend it well. Next, add that mixture to the      lukewarm milk, stir it thoroughly, and pour the inoculated      liquid into clean jars.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>[3] Incubation.</strong> You'll now need to      incubate the sealed jars at 110°-120°F for 3 to 6      hours (or longer for a tangier yogurt). There are numerous      setups manufactured for this purpose, ranging from hay- or      featherlined boxes to electric incubators, but most folks      choose a simpler and less costly route, such as setting the      jars in warm water in a sealed pressure canner or placing      them in a warm oven just be sure to keep the temperature      within the required range, as the bacteria are inactive      below 90'F and will be killed at temperatures above      120°F</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>[4] Refrigeration.</strong> When the coagulated      liquid has set up to your liking, refrigerate the jars ...      and spoon up a serving of your own creamy yogurt!</em>    </p>
