                    <h5 id="byline">      By David Petersen    </h5>        <p>      For many Americans, especially those of us from the West,      the coyote is a symbol of the freedom and independence of      all things wild. And for those fortunate enough to have      heard it, the lonely, ethereal sound of the little canid's      song sparks either a primal fear of the wild and unknown or      the nostalgic, almost instinctive comfort of knowing that      we're hearing a music that entertained and enthralled Homo      long before he was <em>sapiens.</em>    </p>        <p>      And for most of us, that's about as far as our knowledge      of, experience with, or concern for the coyote extends. But      for some-a relative handful of western ranchers, most      of them sheepmen-the "prairie wolf" has become the      center of special attention these last few years. These      modern-day sheep- and cowboys charge the coyote with the      crime of killing newborn calves and lambs. Especially      lambs. In fact, so much stock is lost to predators, some      sheepmen claim, that the coyote is literally eating them      out of business.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, a growing number of wildlife conservation groups      and concerned individuals counter that the situation isn't      nearly as bad or as simplistic as the wool growers would      have us believe. They say that the ranchers aren't playing      fair and never have, that they are exaggerating their      predation losses, that the coyote is being used as a      scapegoat to cover up the ranchers' managerial      shortcomings, and that some of the substances and methods      used in the war against predators are inhumane and      dangerous-and shouldn't be allowed on our public lands      (where the ranchers in question graze their stock).      Furthermore, say the conservationists, the real question      isn't whether the ranchers can survive the predations of      the coyote, but whether our western public domain can      survive many more years of abuse by the stockmen and      bureaucrats who hold its fate in their hands.    </p>    <p>      The western rancher's war on predators extends back to the      frontier days when he was slugging it out with buffalo,      wolves, Indians, and squatters for control of the vast      rangelands. But the rancher long ago extirpated those other      competitors ... leaving only the durable coyote to      challenge his sovereignty.    </p>    <p>      Today, even as you read this, the wool growers and      conservationists have taken their differences to the      federal courts. Meanwhile, Mr. Coyote concentrates his      efforts on the actual battlefront, where he daily dodges      bullets, traps, and poisoned baits in his determination to      see to the tasks that nature designed and intended him for:      killing, eating, and reproducing.    </p>    <p>      And so far, the amazingly resilient and adaptable canid      seems to be holding his own. Even prospering. In fact, a      recent survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)      revealed resident coyote populations in all of the 48      contiguous states except Rhode Island! Even so, <em>Canis      latrans</em> (the "barking dog") is primarily a western      fixture, thriving on and in the prairies, deserts, and      mountains of that semiarid country. But-as the FWS      survey confirms-he'll set up housekeeping virtually      anywhere when necessity and survival demand (sometimes      being pushed to the very shoreline of civilization, where      he's obliged to subsist on an "international" diet of      American alley cats, Norway rats, and errant French      poodles).    </p>    <p>      'But for all his varied range, Mr. C grows largest and most      beautiful in the northern Rocky Mountains, where his diet      is both ample and diverse and includes-well, just      about everything. Mice, voles, rabbits, squirrels,      chipmunks, and other small creatures are his favored foods      ... though he also loves carrion and will sample various      vegetarian dishes on occasion. And when times are truly      hard, game is scarce, and hunting conditions are favorable      (lots of deep, soft snow), he'll make a go at bringing down      a young, old, sick, or otherwise easy-to-catch deer,      antelope, or even elk. Which is entirely in keeping with      the spirit of the old Eskimo maxim-as reported by Canadian      naturalist Farley Mowat-that says "It is the wolf who      keeps the caribou strong." (Even so, more big game is      killed each winter by feral and free-running domestic dogs      than by all other predators combined!) Still, when western      wool growers insist on crowding all those sheep onto the      public rangelands and forests, thereby decreasing the      abundance of natural game ... and when those same sheep are      often left unattended for weeks and months at a stretch,      even at lambing time ...    </p>    <p>      It's that taste for the meat of ungulates, of course, that      has gotten the coyote into so much hot water with sheepmen      and, to some extent, with hard-luck hunters. (Maybe you've      seen the bumper sticker that rationalizes, "Did the coyotes      get your deer this year?")    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, the little canid carries on and, if given the      opportunity, will live to the age of 12 or so in the wild.      Though these days, what with times being so rough and all,      a coy ote is lucky to enjoy even a couple of harassed and      hungry years before being shot, caught, poisoned, or      deprived of his livelihood through habitat reduction.(which      is the ulti mate threat to <em>all</em> wildlife and, in      the majori ty of cases, the <em>real</em> villain that "got      your deer"). Many coyotes, in fact, are blown up or roasted      alive as unweaned pups in their subterranean      nurseries-a controversial pre dator control practice      known as "denning."    </p>    <p>      But enough coyote talk for now. Time to visit with the      sheepmen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE      RANCH</strong> . . .    </p>    <p>      I use the catchall term "ranchers" in what follows only      because it's unavoidable. But my observations concern only      a relatively small group of some 36,000 stockmen (and there      are many notable exceptions among <em>their</em> number)      who run animals on the Bureau of Land Management (BLM.) and      national forest lands of the American West ... receive      substantial subsidies from the federal govern ment to do so      (in 1982, federal expenditures on behalf of      public-land-using stockmen exceeded income from the grazing      fees paid for the millions of animals involved to the tune      of almost $14 a head) ... and yet squeal for even      <em>more</em> federal help when a coyote nips one of their      often neglected animals.    </p>    <p>      I speak of those who lease grazing privileges from the      government at something like 16% of what they'd have to      fork out to rent private pasture, of those who enjoy      government strung fence and government-graded roads and      government-dug stock tanks and wells. I speak especially of      those who, even at the bargain basement rates they're      paying, feel pressed to sneak more animals than they pay      for onto the public domain.    </p>    <p>      With the help of politically hog-tied and/or kowtowing BLM      and Forest Service bureaucrats, this handful of stockmen      are overgrazing western America to the detriment of its      scant water supply and critical riparian zones, and to the      detriment of our vestigial populations of native western      wildlife (wildlife that is supposedly guaranteed "equal      time" by the impotent Classification and Multiple Use Act      and its more recent echo, the Federal Lands Policy and      Management Act of 1976).    </p>    <p>      And what do we, the taxpayers who subsidize the government      that subsidizes the cost ineffective western livestock      business, get out of it? Why, we get polluted water and      soil erosion, along with fences, sheep, cows, horses, and      goats on our public domain. (But then, we must remember      that it's not entirely the ranchers' fault. After all, they      may run too much inventory on the public land and wring the      very lifeblood from it for a few more almighty dollars ...      but it's the federal agencies charged with the stewardship      of that same land that <em>allow</em> them to.)    </p>    <p>      Be all that as it may, an increasing portion of the      American public from <em>all</em> parts of the country      (including native westerners) are coming to feel that the      ranchers who are guilty of the above-mentioned moral      indignities (and again, we are concerned here only with      those few) have no right to moan when a coyote, an eagle, a      bear, or a mountain lion gobbles up a bit of their walking      merchandise. Since they're using land that also according      to federal and moral law-belongs to the American people and      to the wildlife that has always been there, they      necessarily must accept predation losses as a normal risk      cost of doing business.    </p>    <p>      "Cactus Ed" Abbey expressed his characteristically      outspoken and on-target views on the coyote/sheep man      conflict way back in the mid-60's in his wilderness tome      <em>Desert Solitaire:</em>    </p>    <p>      The sheepmen complain, it is true, that the coyotes eat      some of their lambs ... but do they eat enough? I mean,      enough lambs to keep the coyotes sleek, healthy and well      fed? . . ' the sheepmen who run their hooved locusts on the      public land and are heavily subsidized, most of them as      hogrich as they are pigheaded, can easily afford these      trifling losses.    </p>    <p>      Now onward to an examination of ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE POLEMICS OF THE DEFENDERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Washington, DC-based organization Defenders of Wildlife      and 13 like-minded environmentalist groups now allied to      fight the Pacific Legal Foundation (the folks from the      sheep camp) in the court and media battles centering around      the coyote are not, from all appearances, a bunch of      "bleeding heart" animal-lovers trying to save the maligned      prairie wolf from the ranchers and government trappers      (known euphemistically as Animal Damage Control agents).      The coyote is holding his own in that fight so far) and      they know it. Rather, they are concerned with [1] the      credence given to the wool growers' hue and cry for even      <em>more</em> federal help in the form of predator control,      [2] the danger to humans and nontarget wildlife species      arising from some of the predacidal substances that have      been used in the past and are being recommended for use      again by the Reagan administration, and [3] the nature of      the seemingly unholy alliance between the administration      and the western stockmen's organizations.    </p>    <p>      In short, the conservationists see themselves as fighting a      battle to protect America from her own self-consuming      greed. And their precise concern just now is a predacidal      toxin with the clinical name of sodium monofluoroacetate,      better known as Compound 1080.    </p>    <p>      As compounds go, 1080 is a dandy: no taste, no odor, looks      like powdered sugar, attacks the cardiovascular and central      nervous systems simultaneously, induces convulsions and      perfect agony, and is responsible for the tortured deaths      of countless thousands of predators, untold numbers of non      target wildlife, and a couple of dozen <em>humans.</em>      There's no treatment and no known antidote for Compound      1080.    </p>    <p>      For years, sodium monofluoroacetatedoped "carcass baits"      (most frequently, horses that were led to the baiting sites      and shot) were strewn about both public and private      rangelands and forests. Then, in 1972, its use on federal      lands was halted by a Nixon executive order, with the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-then, as now,      directed by William D. Ruckelshaus-follow ing suit by      banning the poison for all uses, anywhere, save for limited      application as a rodenticide.    </p>    <p>      Shortly after coming into office, President Reagan      rescinded the executive order that had banned 1080 on      public lands, thereby sending a clear political directive      to his flock of appointees at Interior and EPA (at that      time, Watt, Burford, Gorsuch, et al) to emasculate their      respective agencies' Compound 1080 prohibitions. Which they      did. As quickly as they could make it happen.    </p>    <p>      In October of 1982, EPA Administrative Law Judge Spencer T.      Nissen ruled in favor of lifting the ten-year ban on 1080      (while Director Ruckelshaus stood aside, taking the part of      a politically fearful Pontius Pilate). Then, almost exactly      one year later, Lee Thomas, another EPA judge (with the      bizarre title of Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste      and Emergency Response) issued a final decision in the 1080      case, which essentially affirmed judge Nissen's earlier      call to 'Ireregister" (EPA talk for lifting the ban) the      poison for use in "single lethal dose baits" and "toxic      collars" to be worn by sheep.    </p>    <p>      According to FWS, the proposed toxic collars would contain      a quantity of sodium monofluoroacetate calculated to kill a      coyote when the predator went for the throat of a      sacrificial lamb. And the single lethal dose baits would      employ 1080 in small balls of tallow (or another      attractant) designed to be swallowed whole by the first      scavenger that came along, thereby proving lethal to only      one animal per bait pellet.    </p>    <p>      But neither the sheepmen nor the conservationists are      pleased with the EPA's attempted compromise, and both sides      have filed notice of appeal. The wool growers say they need      the old pre-1972 "no holds barred" 1080 liberties in order      to effectively combat the growing coyote predation problem.      The conservationists say that coyotes are not the primary      cause of the ranchers' problems, and that much of the blame      has to fall on the stockmen themselves. Furthermore, say      the conservationists, <em>any</em> amount of a poison as      dangerous and indiscriminate as Compound 1080-used in      <em>any</em> fashion-is too much.    </p>    <p>      But enough introduction and overview. At this point, let's      turn the lectern over to representatives of the two      opposing teams on the 1080 playing field. The following      paraphrased statements were gathered through a series of      lengthy conversations with representatives from EPA, FWS      (and their subagency, Animal Damage Control), Defenders of      Wildlife, sheepmen, a professional trapper, and a variety      of published sources including the EPA's "Technical Review      Documents on Compound 1080."    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACCORDING TO THE FWS (ET AL) ...</strong>    </p>    <p>      * Over the past few years, reported incidents of coyote      predation have steadily increased. <em>Latrans</em> is      ranging more and more easterly, and now stock raisers even      in some New England states are reporting problems.    </p>    <p>      * If used properly, Compound 1080 is a "very      species-specific" toxicant, and nontarget wildlife deaths      from the poison are "very rare." Eagles (a species that the      conservationists feel is especially endangered by 1080) are      highly resistant to the poison, as proved by research. (In      that research, a bait was laced with the "standard dose"      of.8 grains of 1080 per 100 pounds of meat and fed to      coyotes and eagles. FWS reports that it took only 2.5      ounces of the bait to kill a coyote, while over a pound was      required to prove lethal to an eagle.)    </p>    <p>      * To test the charge that 1080 produces secondary poisoning      (one animal dying after eating the flesh of another that      was killed by a toxin)' FWS drafted a flock of magpies,      which, they say, are the most sensitive of all birds to the      compound. After killing a coyote by administering five      times the normal lethal dose of 1080, the researchers      enclosed the birds with the dead predator and forced them      to eat its flesh or starve. Reportedly, none of the magpies      died from eating the coyote (though a few did starve rather      than give it a try).    </p>    <p>      * The fear that 1080 will be removed from sheep collars and      used in carcass baits is unfounded, since the collars will      cost ranchers at least $16 each, and the contents of six      collars would be required to do the job. Besides, why would      anyone turn to such an expensive source of poison when it's      available, at a much lower cost, through an active Mexican-      and Canadian-supplied black market?    </p>    <p>      * Ranchers have a <em>right</em> to demand federal predator      control assistance, since they contribute a share of such      programs' funding through cooperative agreement with the      federal government and their respective states and      stockmen's associations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>. . . AND CONSERVATIONISTS REPLY . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      *The FWS's own statistics on the increase in the coyote      population prove that the lethal methods of predator      control used by that agency over the past several decades      have served only to <em>magnify</em> the problem. (Coyotes      have the ability to increase the size of their litters      dramatically when their numbers are threatened.)    </p>    <p>      * FWS's claims that 1080 is <em>not</em> a threat to      nontarget wildlife are invalid, because that agency has      never run a monitoring program that was adequate to make      that determination. Indeed, in one striking case that      throws considerable doubt on the FWS statements, one of      that agency's predator control officers, working on his own      time, spiked one of his 1080 bait stations with the tracer      chemicals zinc and cadmium sulfide. Later, he collected the      corpses of animals found in the vicinity of the bait and      took them home, where he performed necropsies in order to      determine the presence or absence of the 1080 tracer. Of      the 82 animals that he examined, 37 contained the tracer.      The results broke down like this: 4 coyotes, I dog, 8      badgers, 2 bobcats, 2 pine martins, 1 mink, 1 weasel, 6      golden eagles, 1 redtailed hawk, 4 magpies, 2 prairie      falcons, 1 sharp-tailed hawk, 1 Canada jay, 1 rough-legged      hawk, and 2 hawks of indeterminable species. The predator      control agent subsequently resigned from FWS and hied to      the camp of the conservationists.    </p>    <p>      * All FWS claims as to the practicality and effectiveness      of 1080 are based on an ideal scenario: their "when used      properly" line. In reality, that situation is rarely      achieved.    </p>    <p>      * The "small amount" of 1080 contained in a single sheep      collar (300 to 600 mg in a solution of 30 to 60 cc) is      sufficient to kill six to twelve 150-pound humans, 30 or      more children, or countless wild and domestic animals.    </p>    <p>      * Sheepmen do contribute to predator control funds, but the      federal government puts up a minimum of $3 for every $1      kicked in by the ranchers and their states      <em>combined.</em> That's too much, and as Dr. Denzel      Ferguson (a rangelands expert) puts it, FWS is "using      public funds to kill publicly owned animals on public lands      for the economic gain of private stockmen."    </p>    <p>      * Habitat reduction and overgrazing-not      predators-are the significant killers of wildlife.      Steve Gallizioli, Research Chief for the Arizona Fish and      Game Department, has said that "the grazing of domestic      livestock on western rangelands has probably had a greater      adverse impact on wildlife populations than any other      single factor."    </p>    <p>      * Obviously, say the conservationists, the real question is      not how to keep the coyotes from eating sheep, but how to      keep livestock from eating the American West!    </p>    <p>      <strong>ALL IN ALL</strong>    </p>    <p>      The predator/poison/rancher/conservationist controversy is      complex and confusing. Neither the ranchers/bureaucrats nor      the conservationists have been totally guiltless of      hyperbole and emotionalism (although it's clear to me that      one side does appear considerably less objective than the      other). But the one undeniably good thing to come of it      all-and specifically from the present court and media      battles over EPA's attempts to re-register Compound      1080-is more research <em>...</em> from both sides.      And I hope that, along with studying predators and poisons,      someone with a sense of justice and a position of      authority, somewhere, will do some serious digging into the      Wild West politicking and bureaucratic castle-building that      have allowed our public lands to be abused and degraded to      the shameful condition they're in today.    </p>    <p>      But still, can't something be done for those stock raisers      who do have an honest coyote problem <em>...</em>      homesteaders, small-time cattle and sheep ranchers who      graze on their own pasture, and even the few honorable      publicland lessees who shun federal assistance and      toxicants?    </p>    <p>      Yes, something <em>can</em> be done. They can help      themselves. Many already are. Several nonlethal predator      control methods have been tested and proved effective,      including electric "coyote fences" as used successfully in      New Zealand, taste-aversion substances that offend rather      than kill, guard dogs (the Great Pyrenees is hell on      coyotes and feral dogs but a veritable lamb with children      and domestic livestock), "shed birthing" (Mr. Coyote can't      get your lambs if they're born in a barn!), and probably      the most effective anti-predator method of all-proper      shepherding. (When the wool and mutton markets took a      tumble a few years back, one of the first expenses many      sheepmen cut was the number of "field representatives" they      employed.)    </p>    <p>      Let the ranchers give some of those alternatives a fair      shake, at their own expense, and see if things don't      improve. That's the way of honest, free enterprise. That's      the way John Wayne and the Marlboro Man would do it.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, the coyote continues to operate quite in tune      with nature and his given purpose on Earth <em>...</em> as      opposed to our constant meddling and attempts to dominate      and control everything, including each other.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps, in the big picture, the coyote is smarter than we      are.    </p>    <h3>Access:</h3>    <p>      <strong>READING</strong>    </p>    <p>      For <em>those who'd like to</em> learn more about various      aspects of this conflict, I <em>heartily recommend the      following sources:</em>    </p>    <p>      The Coyote: Defiant Songdog of the West <em>by Francois      Leydet (1979, University of Oklahoma Press, $7.95 in      paperback, 224 pages, available through any good bookstore)      is a thorough and entertaining investigation of</em> Canis      latrans <em>and all the hubbub that surrounds him      today.</em>    </p>    <p>      Sacred Cows at the Public Trough <em>by Denzel and Nancy      Ferguson (1983, Maverick Publications, P.O.
