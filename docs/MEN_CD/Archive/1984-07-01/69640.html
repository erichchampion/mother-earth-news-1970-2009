                    <p>      <em>The French Broad River begins up in Transylvania County      in the mountains of Western North Carolina and winds down      through the city of Asheville, its waters eventually      entering the Mighty Mississippi. </em></p>   <p><em>Today the waterway is utilized by paddlers,      fisherfolk, sightseers, and countless other outdoor      enthusiasts. Natives point to it with pride, and there's      talk going around of turning parts of the river into a      source of water for the Asheville area. To stand on its      bank and gaze out over the vast expanse of beautiful,      flowing water, you'd never guess that this river was once      so severely polluted that the same folks who brag on it      today once called it an "open sewer."</em></p>      <p><em>Twenty years ago the French Broad was used as a      veritable flush toilet for all manner of environmental      unmentionables, from industrial and agricultural wastes to      raw city sewage, discarded livestock carcasses, and junked      cars. Back then, the stench alone was enough to turn      picnickers and paddlers away. And sadder still was the fact      that many fish that are native to the river, such as the      muskie, had all but died out.</em></p>      <p>      <em>So what happened? How did the French Broad change from      a reeking sewer to a relatively healthy, stable waterway?      Well, for one thing, back in 1972 the Clean Water Act was      passed, and it put a lot of restrictions on the industries      and sewage systems that were dumping wastes into rivers      nationwide. But, more specifically, several groups in      Western North Carolina-including the Tennessee Valley      Authority, Land-of-the-Sky Regional Council, and informal      groups of concerned citizens-combined forces to clean up      the longneglected waterway. Their efforts paid      off in a clean and pleasing river. What's      more, the muskie have returned!</em></p>      <p>      <em>Don't go away yet; the story is not quite over. This      past fall the regional council enlisted the help of a newly      formed nonprofit citizens' organization called the French      Broad River Foundation, Inc. The foundation is modeled      after similar tax-exempt river revitalization groups in      other parts of the state (most notably the      Association for the Preservation of the Eno River in      Durham). Its growing membership consists of livery owners,      outfitters, local government officials, college professors,      and other people who value the French Broad as an important      natural resource for Western North Carolina.</em></p>      <p>      <em>FBRF's goals are "to work toward the preservation and      improvement of the river's water quality, fish, and      wildlife ... to improve its potential for recreation ... to      encourage and assist in the formation of community-based      'streamwatch' groups in the river's tributary watersheds      ... and to educate the public about the river. " To date,      the foundation is most visible activity is its      participation in an annual event called French Broad River      Week. This is seven rollicking days of fun occurring in the      fall, dedicated to picking up trash in and around the      river. In addition, there are photo contests, raft races,      nature hikes, slide shows and lectures about the river, and      much more! During this week liveries and outfitters in the      river basin donate equipment, time, staff, and shuttle      services. For example, one outfitter advertised, "Have a      good time while doing something worthwhile for the      community on this free whitewater rafting river cleanup      trip from Barnard to Hot Springs. All equipment, guides,      transportation, and beverages will be provided by the      Nantahala Outdoor Center. " This outfitter is one of the      biggest in the Southeast.</em></p>      <p>      <em>The story of the French Broad River is a happy one, and      one that weekend paddler and livery owner alike can learn      from. All across the country nonprofit organizations like      the FBRF are cropping up(if there's not      one in your area, perhaps you should start one!), and each      one of them is in need of active members. It's no secret      that our waterways are at the top of the endangered natural      resources list (ahead of forestland!)... so       it's up to everyone who enjoys and utilizes them to see      to their health and well-being. If you want to enjoy      nature, you've got to help take care of it, too.</em>    </p>
