                            <p>      Lately, more and more people have begun to understand just      how limited-in both variety and nutritional      value-our "modern'' diets have become. This      realization has sparked a new and widespread interest in      the culinary and therapeutic uses of herbs ... those plants      which -although not well-known today-were, just      one short generation ago, honored ''guests" on the dinner      tables and in the medicine chests of our grandparents'      homes. In this regular feature, MOTHER will examine the      availability, cultivation, and benefits of our "forgotten''      vegetable foods and remedies . . . and-we      hope-help prevent the loss of still another bit of      ancestral lore.    </p>    <p>      The very name of this herb bespeaks flavor, and in fact,      summer savory <em>(Satureja hortensis)</em> imparts a      delicious taste to almost any dish the gourmet prepares. In      medieval times it was added to pies and cakes for a touch      of spiciness; today it's primarily used in soups, stews,      and marinades, and with meats and vegetables. Although it's      often referred to as "the bean herb"-being especially      good with string beans, limas, navy beans, soybeans, and      all types of broad bean-savory goes well with many      other vegetables, such as cabbage, tomatoes, green peppers,      asparagus, cauliflower, mixed greens, and rice. The      versatile herb is also tasty in stuffings, sausages, and      pork pie, and with chicken, fish, game meats, beef, lamb,      and eggs (try it in scrambled eggs or omelets). Boiled with      strong smelling foods like broccoli or sauerkraut, it helps      prevent cooking odors. Steeped in vinegar or salad      dressing, it lends an aromatic flavor. People on low-sodium      diets may even find it an agreeable salt substitute.    </p>        <p>      Savory's uses aren't limited to the kitchen, however. Since      the days of the ancient Egyptians who stirred the powdered      herb into their love potions-it has been praised as a      remedy for sore throats, dim vision, sciatica, palsy,      intestinal disorders of various kinds, and the stings of      wasps and bees. Nicholas Culpeper, the famous seventeenth      century apothecary and author, valued it as a virtual      cure-all and recommended that it always be kept on hand.    </p>        <p>      There are several species of savory, with slightly      different growing habits. Although summer savory has the      most delicate flavor and is preferred for culinary use, all      have the same general uses in the herb-conscious household.      Satureja hortensis is a hardy annual, easily grown from      seed, which prefers full sun and rich, well-watered (but      also well-drained) soil. Savory is regarded as a companion      plant to both onions, whose growth it encourages, and      beans, which it reputedly helps protect from the ravages of      the Mexican bean beetle. The seeds, which are readily      available from outlets supplying herb seeds, can be sown      around April and germinate in two to three weeks when      exposed to light (plant them shallowly) and outside      temperatures. For best growth and development, the young      plants should be thinned to about six inches apart. The      mature herb is approximately 18 inches tall, with many      branches and soft, narrow, dark green leaves that are about      one half inch in length. Light pink or lavender flowers      appear in July, followed by dark brown or black, nut-shaped      seeds. If these are gathered for future planting, they      should be used following sprinq, as they 9 lose their      viability after a year.    </p>        <p>      Summer savory grows fast. Since the leaves curl and turn      brown after the plant has flowered, it should be harvested      continually once it reaches six inches in height. Young,      tender shoot tips are best for use in cooking; later, the      entire plant can be cut for drying. Savory is cooperative      about being dried (which it does quite rapidly). Simply tie      the stems in bunches and hang them in an airy room for a      couple of days. When the leaves are lightly crisp, strip      them from the stems and store them in an airtight      container, just as you would any other herb. The fresh      leaves can also be preserved by freezing: Just put clean,      small bunches into plastic bags, label them, pop them into      the freezer, and-later-enjoy them!    </p>
