                    <hr />        <p>      <em>If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us about it in around 500 words (write to      Bootstrap Businesses, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>Â°, 105      Stoney Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28791): Be sure to mention when and where you started your      venture and with how much "seed money"; what you make      (net), and anything else that might be</em> of      <em>assistance to other entrepreneurs. If your story is      used in this column, you'll receive [1] the      satisfaction</em> of <em>knowing that you may help someone      else start a business and [2] a free two-year new or      renewal subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></em><br />      <br />      Like most people, I'm constantly on the lookout for any      idea that might enable me to bring in some extra cash by      working at home in my spare time. When I saw the article      "The Magnesium Fire Starting Tool" on page 26 in MOTHER NO.      55, I realized that most of the vacationers, campers, hunt      er <em>,</em> fisherfolk, and backpackers who visit      <em>my</em> area could <em>use</em> a handy "burn begin- I      decided I could meet their need inexpensively . . . and      make some money by marketing my own type of fire      starter.<br />      <br />      Starting with a baking tin and a supply of paper muffin      cups, I gathered a bunch of pinecones (conifers are      plentiful in my area) and rounded up some old candle stubs.      I placed the paper liners in the tin and then put one cone      in each. Next, I melted the candles in a saucepan and      poured some of the hot wax over each seedpod. When the      liquid cooled and hardened, my homemade fire starters were      ready.<br />      <br />      Lit under wood laid for a campfire, a "cone cupcake"-it      only takes <em>one-will</em> burn long enough to turn even      the wettest kindling into a comforting, warm blaze. I sell      these little fire starters through stores located near      local state parks and vacation spots . . . for 251      each.<br />      <br />      A batch of 24 fire starters takes about a half-hour to make      and brings in a total of $6.00. The cost of the cups for a      run of two dozen amounts to only about 11t, leaving me with      a profit of $5.89 a batch. So I'm earning almost $12 per      hour! What's more, I've had no trouble selling as many      cupped kindlers as I can make.<br />      <br />      Though I'm just getting started in my new home-business      venture, I've already given some thought to selling my      igniters by mail order. And I hope that when I take my next      vacation, I can finance the trip-at least in part-by      selling my fire starters along the way!<br />      </p>      <p><strong>Hazel Colgrove<br />         Bandon, Ore.</strong>      </p>    <p>      Last fall, because of my desire to supply my family with      freshly squeezed, natural fruit juice coupled with the      seemingly universal need these days for extra cash, I      decided to build the hand-cranked cider mill described on      page 62 of MOTHER NO. 71. Almost immediately after the      cider provider was completed, I <em>pressed</em> it into      service for both purposes.<br />      <br />      First, following MOM's directions, I was able to build my      sturdy fruit grinder/press at a cost of about $150 for      parts. Next, the folks from the local agricultural      extension of our state college furnished me with thorough      information on where to locate "pick your own"      fruits.<br />      <br />      I found that prices for an 850 to 950 pound bin of windfall      apples ranged from as low as $20 to as high as $65 . . .      for a "commercial" customer like me. Naturally, I placed an      order for one of the $20 bins, and the orchard I visited      was ready for me to load up as soon as I arrived.<br />      <br />      After a delicious trial run by my family, I bought a supply      of Styrofoam cups and plastic gallon jugs (for a total of      $32) . . . loaded the apples, cider mill, and other      equipment into a truck . . . and drove to nearby      Philadelphia, where a fair was taking place in one of the      city's parks.<br />      <br />      I set up the mill and began cranking out the fresh cider .      . . and the crowds gathered 'round! They eagerly bought as      much juice as I could squeeze, at either 50d a cup or $3.00      a gallon. Of course, I sold many more cupfuls than jugs of      the golden liquid. I'd estimate, though, that I pressed      about 50 gallons total.<br />      <br />      Without considering the cost of the cidermaker-I was      going to make it anyway-my afternoon's toil brought me a      profit of $140 (that's <em>after</em> deducting the cost of      the fruit and the containers, as well as $25 for gas and      tolls).<br />      <br />      Because of the mill's proven success both as a cider- and      moneymaker, I'm now considering building a larger press,      possibly operated by a device similar to the one featured      in "Cycle Power" (page 136, issue 67), rather than by a      hand-turned crank.<br />      <br />      After all, nobody ever said you can't have your juice      <em>and</em> a profit, too!<br />      </p>      <p><strong>Phil Smith Camden, N.J.</strong></p>     <p>      A little more than a year ago, when a chronic illness      forced me to give up my 12-year career as a plasterer, my      family was compelled to find a new source of income.      Inspired by several articles in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>,      including "Bundles of Money From Buttons" by G.R. Osborne      on page 84 of issue 70, we all decided the answer to our      financial problems might well be found in pursuing our      family hobby . . . making decorative and useful items out      of rattlesnake skins.<br />      <br />      We already had five nice-sized prairie rattlers in the      freezer and were equipped with most of the tools-such as a      skinning knife and scissors for cutting and trimming-that      we needed to get started. So we purchased a tanning kit for      $10.00, five basic belt buckle kits at $1.98 each, and      three fancier ones at $4.98 each . . . and then placed a      $5.00 advertisement in the local newspaper stating we would      make custom belt buckles, belts, and hatbands.<br />      <br />      Well, the orders started coming in right away. It took only      one snakeskin to make our first eight buckles, and after      selling the smaller ones for $7.50 each and the larger ones      for $15 apiece, we were left with a profit of $50 (half of      which we reinvested).<br />      <br />      Encouraged by the response to our initial ad, we expanded      our marketing effort to include displaying our wares at      such places as black powder shooting matches, arts and      crafts fairs, western clothing stores, and-at the      suggestion of my seven-year-old daughter-flea markets.      (She'd had a good idea: We made a $300 profit from the      first two we attended!) We've also enlarged our inventory.      In addition to hatbands, buckles, and belts, we're now      making key chains, necklaces, earrings, wall hangings,      hatpins, and even vertebrae friendship rings (which our      five-year-old son sells to the younger generation for 10      each!).<br />      <br />      Because my illness might prevent me from hunting and      catching rattlers in the future, we placed another ad in      the paper offering 80t a foot for live snakes with      undamaged skins. Since rattlesnakes are considered by      ranchers in our area to be a clanger to people, pets, and      livestock, we've had no shortage of suppliers. (My      mother-in-law once dropped by-very briefly-when we were      unloading 67 just-purchased rattlers!)<br />      <br />      When someone brings in a load of live rattlers, we very      carefully-wearing high leather boots and gloves and using a      four-foot handling stick-place them in canvas bags and put      the sacked serpents in the freezer for a few hours. This      kills the reptiles without harming the hides. (Let me      emphasize that anyone considering handling poisonous snakes      should take every safety precaution. Care should even be      taken when dealing with a <em>dead</em> snake, as the fangs      and poison sacs will still contain the venom.)<br />      <br />      In all, because our rattlesnake business has taught us to      cooperate to overcome economic adversity, strengthening      both our finances <em>and</em> our family ties, we plan to      keep it going even after I'm able to return to "regular"      work!<br />      </p>      <p><strong>Robert F.
