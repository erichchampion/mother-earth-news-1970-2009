                <p>      <em>"I love those who yearn for the impossible."</em>      <em>(Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      REPORT FROM Joyce Alexander    </h5>    <hr />        <p>      Perhaps I should have entitled this article "How to Go to      College Even When You Think You Can't!", because-at age      35-I'm not only a divorced mother who's actively involved      in rearing two preteenaged sons, by myself, on a small      farmstead . . . I'm also a full-time college student. And,      although juggling the two roles of country mother and      campus coed can be pretty demanding (not to mention      confusing!) at times, I'm happy to say that my life is      continuously challenging, always fulfilling, and      <em>never</em> boring!<br />      <br />      Over the past three years, my boys and I have had to      shoulder new responsibilities and solve complicated      problems that-before my divorce never dreamed we could      handle by ourselves. You see, when I was married, I thought      living the good life meant staying at home with the      children and tending to the chores on a little farm . . .      while my husband worked in town to pay the bills and helped      out around the place on weekends. Our family was getting      pretty good at homesteading, too: We were raising most of      our own food and striving to become fuel self-sufficient,      as well.		</p>	      <h3>THE HARD SMACK OF REALITY</h3>     <p>      Sadly, however, my bubble of idyllic self-reliance burst      very quickly once my husband and I were separated, and I      found myself <em>alone</em> with two youngsters to raise      and no income <em>or</em> assets (except 3,000 canning      jars, a few sticks of furniture, a beat-up pickup truck,      and about $6.00 in cash) to help me out. I knew the three      of us couldn't afford to stay on the farm, so I considered      moving to the city where I might find a job. But somehow,      just <em>thinking</em> about that odious option was more      than I could stand, and I suddenly realized that I wanted      much more for my children-and for myself than to "survive"      in some overcrowded, smog ridden metropolis! I wanted us to      be able to continue to thrive in a natural and invigorating      environment . . . and there simply <em>had</em> to be a way      to do that.<br />      <br />      So, with renewed fire for pursuing a life that was worth      living, I dismissed the idea of moving to a big city and      came up with a new plan. I knew that-since it takes at      least <em>some</em> money to maintain a homestead, and      there was no longer a man around to keep it coming      in"bringing home the bacon" was now solely up to me. That      meant I needed to acquire some kind of career skill. I      decided to go to school and get a degree in nursing, a      profession I figured I could practice anywhere . . . even      in the country!<br />      <br />      Maybe I didn't have any <em>material</em> assets to assist      me in achieving this goal, but I sure as heck had some      valuable natural resources to fall back on . . . such as an      active imagination (which had gotten me out of many a tight      spot) and an impregnable stubborn streak (which refused to      allow the word "impossible" to enter into my vocabulary!).      But, most important, I had two terrific kids who believed      in-and depended upon-good old Mom. So, I owed it to the      three of us to see that this dream of an education became a      reality.		</p>	      <h3>HEADING TOWARD ACADEMIA</h3>    <p>      Armed with plenty of determination, I set out to take the      necessary steps toward attaining a Bachelor of Science      degree. First, I traded off a few odds and ends to get my      truck in running, condition. Next, I found a temporary      living situation with a friend just outside a college town.      And then, with <em>no</em> cash up front, I enrolled in a      nursing program!<br />      <br />      How did I manage that neat monetary maneuver? Actually, it      wasn't hard to do. When I checked into the financial aid      program at the small state university where I'd enrolled, I      discovered I was eligible for a $1,000-a-year Pell Grant      (formerly the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant- or BOEG      which covered my tuition and hook costs- and even left me      with a bit of extra cash. I also qualified for, and was      granted-from a local banka government-secured, interest      free (as long as I was a student) loan to cover living      expenses. In addition, although I was too late to be      considered for a state scholarship the first year, I've      gotten that free aid every year since.<br />      <br />      Not wanting to dip into my borrowed money more than I      absolutely had to, I began to discover lots of ways to put      my bartering expertise to work. For example, after I      located a rural rental house that was badly in need of      repairs, I talked the landlord into letting us live on the      tiny two-and-one-half-acre farmstead for free, in exchange      for painting and fixing up the place.<br />      <br />      To earn extra cash income, I got together with a friend and      started a housecleaning service for professors. Our work      hours were flexible, allowing us to juggle them around the      changing schedules of our classes and our children. Soon      the demand for our help grew so much that we had to hire      other students to assist us!		</p>	      <h3>EXTENDED FAMILY</h3>     <p>      Once my children and I were settled into our new home, and      I became acclimated to college life, I began to realize      that there was a whole community of single parents-just      like me-who were short on cash but long on "barterable"      skills. It didn't take long before I was right in the      middle of this group, informally exchanging talents and      time with several people. For instance, I babysat a little      girl whose father kept my vehicle in shape. This same man      worked on another woman's car in exchange for her giving      piano lessons to his daughter. But, since the mechanic      didn't have access to a practice piano, I let his child      come to <em>my</em> house and use our instrument . . . as      long as he came and stayed with his daughter <em>and</em>      my boys so I could go over to <em>his</em> apartment to      study in peace and quiet. Whew! Some of those trade      arrangements got pretty complicated!<br />      <br />      I was also able to persuade some folks to help me with a      few of my homesteading chores (such as gardening, canning,      butchering, and cheesemaking). In exchange for these      volunteers' assistance, I taught them how to do those food      making and preserving jobs and gave them a small share of      the finished products. And the nicest aspect of becoming a      part of this college's single-parent swapper's circle is      that my sons and I now have an extended family of "uncles",      "aunts", and "cousins" with whom we can share, learn, and      enjoy plain old good times.		</p>	      <h3>FULFILLMENT OF A DREAM</h3>     <p>      In the meantime, I've completed three of my four years of      schooling and have been able to earn an annual income      (exclusive of grants and loans) of around $5,000. Now that      may not sound like a whole lot of money for a family of      three, but when you consider that we continue to raise most      of our own food <em>and</em> do a bit of "horse trading"      with our friends for about anything else we need . . .      then-to us-that five grand is practically a      <em>fortune!</em>		</p>	      <h3>THE FUTURE</h3>     <p>      Once I get my degree, I plan to pack up my children and      belongings and settle on 120 acres north of here that my      grandfather left to us. My hope is to farm the land and      build an energy-efficient house (financed by my new      career!).<br />      <br />      Of course, I realize that we're pretty lucky to have a      parcel of property waiting for us. But even if my      granddaddy hadn't been so generous, I feel certain that      <em>somehow</em> we'd find another place to live that'd be      equally suited to our needs. Because if there's one thing      my boys and I have learned by starting from scratch and      "living close to the bone", it's that nothing is impossible      for folks who are just too darn stubborn to believe that it      can't be done!    </p>    <hr />
