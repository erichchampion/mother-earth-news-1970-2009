                    <h5 id="byline">      By Sara Yerkes    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>This California couple has switched</em> <em>off</em>      <em>the power grid . . . without giving up      electricity.</em><br />      <br />      I recently finished my first "sun powered" novel . . . one      that I wrote on an Apple computer run by photovoltaic      electricity. Actually, solar panels are the only source of      electric power that my husband Bill and I have had for more      than a year. You see, we're in the process of planning and      building our own energy self-sufficient (we hope!) house,      and we figure that there's no better way to get into the      independent spirit of the project than to live without a      power utility connection at the building site.<br />      Of course, as many of you have found out, photovoltaic      systems are most cost-effective in sparsely developed areas      . . . where the only other energy choices are setting up      alternative power sources, running a diesel fueled      generator, or having no electricity at all. But Bill has      been involved in the development and manufacture of solar      cells (at Arco Solar, Inc.) for over 15 years, so his      pioneering nature led him to try "stand alone" living even      though we're only a short distance from the power      lines.<br />      <br />      We wanted to see if we could achieve an energy-independent      life that was not at the same time a Spartan one. And,      believe me, the last 12 months or so have been anything but      austere! Our trailer has plenty of modern conveniences,      including lights, a refrigerator, a color television, a      radio, a stereo, and an indoor (electric composting)      toilet. Putting all this together, however, did involve a      good bit of research and experimentation on our part. We      hope that those of you who fancy the idea of either living      or vacationing in remote areas whether for extended periods      or for only a few days at a time-may benefit from our      experience.    </p>              <h3>SHOPPING</h3>      <p>      In a way, our residence itself gave us a slight head start,      because trailers are engineered with a number of attributes      for self reliant living. The 24-foot Layton we'd picked out      included a 300-gallon water tank . . . low-voltage lights      backed up by a pair of batteries . . . a holding tank for      human waste . . . and even a low voltage (or propane)      refrigerator. Unfortunately, most of these features were      not designed with <em>high</em> efficiency in mind, since      trailer owners are expected to pay frequent visits to waste      disposal sites and to recharge the batteries on a regular      basis while driving. That meant we'd have to seek out some      specialized components for our stationary      arrangement.<br />      <br />      During the year preceding our move to the site, we scoured      recreational-vehicle and camping stores in our southern      California region, but were able to locate only a few of      the extra-efficient components that we needed for      photovoltaic living. We did find a Nor cold electronic      refrigerator, however, to replace the absorption-cycle      <strong>Electrolux</strong> t hat had come with the      trailer. The new 12 volt DC (direct current) icebox      consumes only 80 amp-hours per day . . . a tiny fraction of      what the heat-driven unit had used.<br />      <br />      It was during two trips to Europe that we located most of      the equipment for our electricity self-sufficient home.      After a stop to review literature at the Swedish Konsument      Verket--where all consumer appliances in the country are      tested and compared-we purchased a New Mullbank electric      dry composting toilet from a local Stockholm department      store. (We were surprised to find that there are actually      16 manufacturers of composting toilets in Sweden . . .      largely as a result of laws restricting the use of septic      systems at vacation cabins.)<br />      <br />      While in Italy, we found a compact, low profile solar water      heater that fits our trailer far better than did anything      we had seen in the U.S. The 35-gallon passive (or      "breadbox") Discotherm works from the existing water      pressure on our city connection so it requires no extra      pumping energy-and has that famous Italian flare for      combining style with function. The unit is equipped with      acrylic glazing, to which Bill added a layer of treated      nickel foil-which allows 97% o the sunlight to pass      through, but only 3% of the captured energy to escape-to      lessen nighttime heat loss.<br />      <br />      We knew that during the rainy winter months we'd need some      sort of hot-water backup system to augment that solar      collector. So after examining the numerous "tankless"      heaters available in Europe, we settled on a propane-fired      English Thorn Nymph. Unlike a conventional water heater,      our on-demand unit warms liquid only when a hot-water      faucet is turned on (rather than keeping a large quantity      heated at all times), which provides significant energy      savings.<br />      <br />      Another acquisition from our European travels was a Flos      quartz reading lamp. Though the little light was set up to      use Rome's 220-volt AC (alternating current) power, Bill      noticed that it actually transformed that high-voltage      electricity down to 12 volts to heat the filament. By      wiring back from the bulb and <em>around</em> the      transformer, then, he was able to provide us with a compact      lamp . . . one that throws the bright white light      characteristic of quartz bulbs, yet runs on our 12-volt      photovoltaic system.<br />      <br />      Some of the other components contributing to our      home-powered comfort include a Panasonic 12-inch color      television <em>...</em> a Hitachi AM/FM cassette stereo . .      . the Apple II Plus computer with two disk drives, a CRT      monitor, and a 15-inch Epson printer . . . a Repair swamp      cooler . . . and even an Insect Aside bug "zapper". (Also,      before we hooked into city water pressure, we used a Noria      12volt DC water pump.)<br />      <br />      The electricity to run all these appliances comes from 20      Arco Solar 16-2000 photo voltaic panels and is stored in 10      Delco 2000 batteries hidden beneath our dinette benches.      Arco Solar's BP-12 battery protectors monitor the charge      from the panels to the storage cells, but Bill also keeps a      continuous log of the charge level with a strip chart      recorder and makes occasional checks with a      voltmeter.<br />      <br />      Because there are some appliances that just won't run on      the 12-volt DC electricity that the panels supply (through      the batteries), we bought a 300-watt Dytek 120-volt AC      inverter. It supplies the necessary AC power to the      computer, our toilet's fan and stirring mechanism, a coffee      grinder, an electric fan, and-once in a while-an ice cream      maker! With only 300 watts on tap, we do have to be careful      not to use too many appliances simultaneously, but a new      system we're examining (which includes more panels and a      48-volt DC to 120-volt AC, 700-watt inverter) should make      the installation in our permanent house much more      versatile.<br />      </p>      <h3>AND FOSSIL FUEL?</h3>      <p>      Unfortunately, although the sun supplies our electricity,      we haven't yet figured out how to <em>completely</em>      eliminate our need for nonrenewable sources of energy. Much      of our cooking is done on the propane stove in the trailer      (though we do rely on an outdoor barbecue to a great extent      in the summer). Our bottled fuel also provides our space      heating in the wintertime and runs the tankless water      heater that backs up the solar unit from November through      March. Even with those demands, however, we stretch about      six weeks from a single six-gallon bottle of propane during      the cold months.<br />      <br />      By early spring, we can extinguish the pilot light of that      on-demand water warmer and rely solely on the sun until the      following autumn. And in the summer (when we have no      space-heating needs), we can go a full four months between      refuelings. To keep us posted-year round-on the amount of      hot water available in our breadbox collector, we have a      Solar Thermo gauge located in the kitchen. When the device      shows ten lights, I know that we have lots of hot water ..      . when four are lit up, there's enough for a shower . . .      and two lights indicate that I'll have to content myself      with just washing my face.<br />      </p>      <h3>LIFE UNDER THE SUN</h3>      <p>      After living for a year in our 24-foot trailer, we're more      than eager to move into <em>roomier</em> quarters . . . but      we're also glad to report that 160 square feet has sufficed      for even our intensive demands. Our computer and its      accessories have pretty much driven us from the dining      area, but in the spring, summer, and fall we can dine on      the deck that Bill added last year, enjoying the      spectacular scenery from our perch above the San Fernando      Valley.<br />      <br />      The wooden lattice overhanging the deck provides needed      shading for the trailer in the summer. On hot days, we      further cool our home by running the electric fan. Then,      when the mercury really zooms upward (as it did last      August, with temperatures reaching above 105 °F), we      turn on our swamp cooler . . . which draws only 5 amps at      12 volts.<br />      <br />      We're also blessed with good soil, a rarity in this region      of hills and giant rocks. With the double digging      techniques MOTHER introduced us to-and a lot of grumbling      and groaning as we dislodged (and then heaved over the      hill) huge boulders <em>and</em> hunks of broken      pavement-we've created an abundant, pest-free garden.      Grateful honeybees, butterflies, and toads (as well as a      lizard with her offspring) have settled in, thereby      increasing our compatibility with the land. (And, of      course, raising vegetables as we do is <em>another</em> way      of tapping the sun's energy. After all, plants are      excellent solar collectors!)<br />      <br />      Bill and I are very pleased with our life here . . . one      that's rich with nature's power and beauty, complemented by      human ingenuity. From our stay in the trailer, we've      learned a lot about trying to achieve energy independence,      and we hope our completed passively heated and cooled solar      home will bring us even closer to that goal. But we're not      sitting on our photovoltaic duffs just yet. Bill is      currently testing an 11-cubic-foot Sanyo refrigerator and      some new Gould sealed-battery units . . . planning a system      that will provide all electric cooking . . . and even      scheming on how to rig up a solar-powered dish antenna      <em>.</em>    </p>        <hr />
