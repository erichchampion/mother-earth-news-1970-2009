                    <h2 id="subtitle">PICKING THE PERFECT PUP</h2>    <hr />    <p>      Back in No. 52, <em>THE</em> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted)      published an article by Kansas veterinarian Randy Kidd on      how to restrain a farm animal. Little did we (or Randy)      know that the one piece would lead many more . . . yet very      few issues <em>of</em> MOTHER since then haven't carried a      feature by Dr. Kidd on some facet <em>of</em> livestock      care.<br />      <br />      Well, "MOMs medicine man" has now decided to share some      <em>of</em> his ,eye view"on pets, the very special      creatures that we humans for centuries have welcomed into      our homes and hearts. We hope that our curlers will find      Dr. Kidd's columns on this subject to be as informative and      enlightening as have been his commonsense ar t icl e s on      livestock.<br />      </p>      <h5 id="byline">by Randy Kidd</h5>     <p>      Making friends with a new puppy is a lot like beginning an      association with a person you've just met: First      impressions are crucial and often long-lasting. And it's      during those initial moments when would be owner meets      potential pet that the stage is set for a lasting bonding      between master and canine. To best pave the way for an      enduring and happy relationship with an animal, though, you      have to plan ahead . . . which means you need to know,      first of all, what to look for in a good pet and where to      find such a critter. Then you need to figure out what to do      for your young canine when you bring it home for that      getting-to-know-you period.<br />      </p>      <h3>SELECTING YOUR PUPPY</h3>    <p>      Barring those rare times when the perfect pooch just      appears on %,our back steps, you have to go out and shop      for the ideal pup. In general, there are three types of      marketplaces where you can find such an animal: pet stores,      backyard breeders, and professional kennels. Each source      has its advantages and its disadvantages.<br />      <br />      A large commercial pet store will no doubt have the widest      variety ,)f dog breeds to choose from, but it usually      doesn't have the pupies' parents around for you to examine.      That's a definite drawback, since youngsters tend to grow      up to be like their folks. I feel it's extremely important      to take a good look at the older generation before you buy      any offspring.<br />      <br />      Backyard breeders, on the other hand, generally have one or      both of the dogs' parents around for you to inspect . . .      but the selection of puppies is often limited to only one      or two litters. However, most animals bred in small supply      on a homestead are probably accustomed o a lot of human      attention and affection. As a result, these      puppies-like their pet-shop counterparts-are usually      well socialized by lie time you meet them. (Socialization      is that important stage in a young animal's development,      from about six to eight weeks of age, lien it becomes      attached to-and, in turn, anxious to please-its human      family.)<br />      <br />      The third canine showcase, the professional kennel, often      has several fitters of one particular breed to choose from,      as well as the mothers and fathers of all their charges. If      you venture to one of these places, Rough, be aware that      the proprietor may naturally consider his or her breed of      dog to be the only type worth considering. Keep in mind      fiat it may not be the one best suited to you and your      family!<br />      </p>      <h3>BE SENSITIVE</h3>     <p>      One way to go about finding the perfect dog is to keep your      senses alert at all times. In other words, your ears should      be open, your eyes peeled, and your fingertips      tingling.<br />      <br />      The reputation of dog dealers gets around quickly by word      of mouth. Follow up leads, and when you see a canine you      admire, just ask :k the owner where he or she got it. It      could be that the animal came from a nearby kennel or pet      shop that you haven't checked out. 11 so, read the want ads      in your local newspaper and the Yellow Pages in the phone      book to see what other daces are close enough to ex ;lore.      Above all, shop around: Don't limit your search to the      first nine breeder you hear or read about. Make a list of      all the possible sources you might visit, and explore every      one before you make a purchase.<br />      <br />      When you arrive at each marketplace you've made a note of,      don't merely look at the pen full of cute puppies that's      been specially put t here to catch your eye. Poke around      out back to see if there are any other cages filled with      not-so-adorable or -healthy critters. Judge the conditions      in which they've been living. Smell the air around the      pens. Is there any malodor? If you don't like what you see      or smell, drive on to the next stop on your list. In short,      don't take a chance by buying a pup from an unsanitary      home, regardless of how cute the little waif is or how      sorry you feel for it.<br />      </p>      <h3>LET YOUR FINGERS DO THE WALKING</h3>     <p>      Once you've located a well-maintained operation with fit,      yelping youngsters, take your hands out of your pockets and      put them to work. When you've found a litter you like,      carefully pat and stroke each pup in the bunch. You'd be      surprised how much you can tell about the general condition      and health of an animal simply by touching it. Is its coat      full and clean? Does the puppy seem well fed? While you've      got a dog in hand, check its eyes, to make sure they're      clear and bright . . . its nose, to see that the nostrils      are clean and cold . . . and its ears, to make certain      they're free of infection. Also, feel the pup's body for      any abnormal swellings or bumps.<br />      <br />      Finally, after examining every member of the litter, stand      back for a few minutes to watch how the puppies naturally      interact with one another. The pooch who's bold and playful      with its mates will probably be the easiest to train later      on. Avoid both the constantly aggressive bully and the      timid crybaby. The one that loves to tussle and can take      its lumps without whimpering or mounting a major counter      offensive is the one you want.<br />      <br />      When you've watched for a while and think you've sighted      that "rugged individual with the heart of gold", sit in a      spot where all the tailwaggers can get to you . . . and      call them. The first little yapper to come bounding toward      you is nearly always the best dog in the litter.      Occasionally, the best of the bunch will take a detour to      explore the turf, so keep an eye out for the inquisitive      one, too. To be sure not to select a youngster who slinks      into a corner and refuses to be petted . . . no matter how      droopy.<br />      </p>      <h3>VET STOP</h3>    <p>      After you've chosen the pick of the . ... _.-,      -.,·t:. :M% charge to the vet right away for a      physical examination (plus booster ,; ;·· and      a worming program), to make sure your puppy's as sound .:-.      you think it is. Don't give yourself a chance to get      attached to a potential problem . . . one that could wind      up costing you a fortune .:. recurring medical expenses. As      a vet who has examined many newly bought (and apparently      fit) canines that were actually sick or deformed, I advise      you to take your pet to a doctor <em>the very day you buy      it!</em> Defects such as retained testicles, teeth that      don't meet, or knees that aren't formed correctly will      eventually become serious problems . . . ones that the      dog's owner will have to live with for      <em>years.</em><br />      <br />      If your dog does turn out to be unsuitable, return it      immediately to its original owner and exchange it for a      healthier sibling. Harsh as this may sound, it's better      than getting stuck with a future full of unnecessary      heartbreak. And before you've spent a night with the pup      and grown truly fond of it, that's not too painful a thing      to do. Besides, any reputable breeder will be glad to take      back an animal that has an obvious defect. (I assume that      you and the seller agreed upon an exchange and/or refund      policy at the time of sale.)<br />      </p>      <h3>HOME TO BED</h3>    <p>      It's a good idea to lay out your puppy's bed and turf and      to decide on its routine <em>before</em> you get it home.      Predetermining which areas of the house and yard are off      limits and what time the dog's dinner is to be served each      day will give your new housemate the opportunity to get      used to its daily routine from Day One . . . and will cut      down on a lot of possible confusion for both you and the      pup.<br />      <br />      No matter what precautions you take, those first few days      and nights are likely to be a mite tearful for Pup, but you      can help ease its homesickness by placing a hot-water      bottle (wrapped in several thicknesses of towels) or a      loudly ticking alarm clock in its bed. And after those      initial whimperings subside, you'll be amazed at how      quickly and cheerfully your little fella will adopt you and      your family as its own lickin' kin!    </p>    <hr />
