                    <h5 id="byline">      by Randy Kidd    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>MOM's vet takes dead aim at his own advice on goat      keeping published in issue 65.</em>    </p>        <p>      How often-especially when you're talking about      livestock-have you heard the lament, "If I had it to do all      over again, here's what I'd do"? I know I've listened to      such statements more times than I can count! That's not      surprising, though, because I've been in and out of the      goat "business" several times . . . given numerous seminars      and classes on the beasties (while listening to the      comments, complaints, and questions of the goat keeping      folks in attendance) . . . and-as a veterinarian -shared in      the trials and tribulations of many local goat breeders.    </p>    <p>      Well, now it's my turn. Having been awarded a certified      degree in goats by the school of hard knocks, I'm ready to      stand before MOM's readers and recite my own mistakes . . .      and how I'd correct them if I were starting with a clean      slate. You should understand that in some instances my      advice is a far cry from what I used to say a few years ago      (my article "How to Raise Healthy Goats", in MOTHER NO. 65,      page 74, is a case in point). And naturally, since we      caprinekeepers do tend to be a strongly opinionated lot,      not all goatherds will agree with all (or possibly any) of      my revised counsel.    </p>    <p>      This piece will contain a collection of random tips on      getting started . . . selecting and buying stock . . . and      providing shelter for the herd. Part II will go into some      other facets of taking care of these fascinating-and      friendly small livestock. So lend an ear while I list what      I'd do now.    </p>    <h3>      FOR BEGINNERS    </h3>    <p>      I used to tell novices to buy one goat (absolutely no more      than two) . . . but now I think it's a better idea to start      with <em>five</em> or six youngsters. Here's why: To my way      of thinking, three (or maybe four) goats are a practical      number for a person to milk twice a day. If I'm working any      fewer than three animals, I've found that the time spent      setting up to milk-cleaning utensils, hauling grain and      hay, and so forth-really isn't economically used. On the      other hand, if I've got five or more goats to milk, I'm      plumb tuckered out by the time the task is finished.<br />      <br />      With a starter herd of five or six doelings, I can select      the three best producers of that first year to keep, and      still have a couple of young does to sell . . . ladies      that'll bring a premium because they're "in milk" and have      their kids at their sides. I'll then keep the very best of      my unsold female kids until the next year, to see how she      turns out. If she look so as if she'll be a better milk      maker than an animal I already own, I'll keep her. If not,      I'll sell the doe to someone who is less critical than I      am.    </p>    <p>      However, let me warn you that it's easy to become trapped      in what I call the creeping spiral of goat inflation.      "Goatflation" occurs, for instance, when an owner starts      out with one or two critters, fully intending to limit the      herd size to that number . . . but not realizing that the      kids-when they come will be too dad burned cute to ever      sell. Well, that kindhearted goatherd just naturally keeps      the young'uns. The third year is a replay of the same      scenario: The owner soon has eight to ten milking does, all      too "valuable" to sell or cull. And so it goes, until the      goat fancier has so many animals to take care of that he or      she has time for little else!<br />      <br />      The key here, then, is to decide how many goats you want to      milk, and <em>no matter what,</em> to stick to that maximum      number by selling every excess milker . . .especially the      ones that don't measure up to your standards.    </p>    <h3>      SHARING THE WEALTH    </h3>    <p>      Now that I've decided on my perfect herd size and have      sworn to keep absolutely no more than four milkers, I need      to accomplish one more task before I start off on my buying      spree: rounding up some folks who like goat's milk. If I      had it to do all over again, I wouldn't get into the goat      biz in the first place unless I had another family (or two      or <em>three)</em> who wanted to share the milk with me.      The problem with dairy goats, you understand, is that      they're prolific producers. Just keeping <em>one</em> nanny      will give you a gallon of milk per day . . . enough to      leave most families simply awash in goat's milk.<br />      <br />      Many goat people have spent a lot of time and effort      devising ways to use all that excess liquid. Some owners      have even tried selling their dairy products to friends or      neighbors. At present, though, there are very few licensed      commercial operations in the country that are financially      successful at peddling goat's milk or other products . . .      a fact that--sad but true should tell you there's a rather      limited future in the sale of goat's milk.<br />      <br />      So to my way of thinking, the best way to "market" your      milk is to your own household <em>and</em> another family      or two. Ideally, these other folks will be more than      "customers" . . . they'll also be willing to take their      turn at getting their farm-fresh milk right from the      source. After all, I don't mind milking (for me, it's      always been a quiet time for reflection, spent with my head      resting against a goat's warm and contented belly) . . .but      I do get tired of performing the ritual twice a day,      <em>every day</em> of the week.<br />      <br />      That's why I'd like to swap: My friends would get their      milk free in exchange for milking my nannies once or twice      a week, which would give me a nice break from my      chores.<br />      <br />      (I'd keep a pig or two around just in case there's      <em>still</em> some extra milk. Even with several families      sharing the proceeds, you're likely to have some left over      . . . and young, growing hogs will thrive on the surplus.)    </p>    <h3>      BUYING TIPS    </h3>    <p>      If I had my druthers when it came time to pick a goat, I'd      buy a youngster about four to six months of age. (Here's an      instance where I've come at least I80Â° from my previous      opinion. I used to recommend buying a two or three-year-old      doe.) By this time, the doeling should have outgrown her      gangly teenaged appearance, so-by looking at her body size      and type-I can get a fairly good idea of what kind of      producer she'll be. She should weigh 60 pounds or so, and      be ready to breed that first fall. If she's too small      (generally under 60 pounds) or too young, don't buy      her.<br />      <br />      I'd also look for an <em>unbred</em> doeling, because then      I'd be able myself to select the buck to which she's to be      bred. I don't want to be charged the buck's "breeding      fee"-which is typically included in the price of an already      mated doe-as the male would almost certainly be of lower      quality than one I'd pick.<br />      <br />      My second goat-shopping choice would be to head out in the      spring and look for a promising kid. True, I'd know better      what an <em>alder</em> animal was going to look like as an      adult, but-for that very reason-the tyke should be <em>less      expensive.</em><br />      <br />      In other words, with only rare exceptions, I would      <em>not</em> shop for an adult doe now. Purchasing a      full-fledged milk maker is too much like buying a used car:      There's a good chance you'll end up with someone else's      problems. (Plus you have to pay a lot more for a grownup      than for a younger girl.) Bear in mind that most livestock      owners rarely, if ever, get rid of their best and most      trouble-free producers.<br />      <br />      Furthermore, I'd buy only a <em>registered</em> doeling (an      animal with American Dairy Goat Association-ADGA-papers),      not a <em>grade</em> (unregistered) young goat. Of course,      I'd expect to pay more initially for a purebred youngster,      but I'll more than make up the difference when I'm able to      sell her offspring . . . at <em>registered</em>      prices.<br />      <br />      I have no personal preference for any particular breed of      goat . . . I like them all. However, I do think it's a good      idea to buy the breed that's most common in your area. By      sticking with the most popular variety, you'll find a      receptive market for the offspring you'll be selling later      on.<br />      <br />      The grubstake needed to get started in this venture varies      from region to region. Still, I'd say that $100 for a      registered doeling should serve as a ballpark figure almost      anywhere in the country. In Kansas, where I live, a      registered doeling will bring from $75 to $150, depending      on her and her parents' quality. In contrast, a proven      <em>doe</em> fetches from $150 to $300. So you can easily      see that you can buy two or three promising youngsters for      the price of one oldster . . . which'll give you an odds-on      chance of getting a fine producing <em>herd</em> from good      stock fairly soon in your livestock-raising career.    </p>    <h3>      NO EENY, MEENY, MINY, MO    </h3>    <p>      I've said time and time again in my articles for MOTHER      (and haven't revised my opinion in <em>this</em> matter)      that the most important skill you can acquire when you're      dealing with a food- or fiber-producing animal is the      ability to select the best-quality specimen available.      Being able to choose a fine dairy goat is especially      important because-unlike a feeder pig or calf you'll      butcher down the line-you'll be living with your decision      (and her offspring) for many years to come. Of course, the      best way to learn what a decent goat looks like is to      attend some judgings at local goat shows or at a county      fair. Spend enough time there looking at good examples      until the image of an ideal goat is <em>emblazoned</em>      upon your mind.<br />      <br />      Once you've memorized your dream girl's physical      attributes, you can pay attention to specific qualities      that, I feel, are crucial.<br />      <br />      First off, there's <em>size . . . which</em> is the most      important characteristic in determining how much milk the      animal will produce over her lifetime. The rule here is the      bigger the frame, the better. Look for a long, tall doeling      with a deep, widespread chest. The prospect's belly should      look like the cross section of a barrel. However, be      careful not to confuse size with <em>heft . . . the</em>      creature under consideration should be big but refined, not      coarse and thick-boned.<br />      <br />      This lean, angular look is an elusive quality that      livestock owners refer to as "dairy character". In general,      the more of this trait that a beast carries on a      large-sized body, the more milk she'll produce over her      lifetime. Let me put it this way: If the doeling looks as      if she could play linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers,      she doesn't have dairy character.<br />      <br />      If, on the other hand, the goat looks as if (perhaps with a      little mascara and the proper clothes) she could grace the      pages of <em>.Seventeen</em> magazine, <em>then</em> she's      got dairy character. After I've determined that my      prospective purchase is big and well formed, I look at her      <em>teeth</em> and <em>legs. To</em> have a long and      fruitful life, the doe will need to eat and to carry      herself to the feeding trough . . . hence the need for      structurally sound teeth and legs. The animal's lower      incisors should touch squarely on the upper dental pad, not      in front or behind it. Her legs should appear to drop      straight down from her body when she's viewed from the      front and the back, and her forward and rear "pinnings"      should have the correct angle at the hock, hip, shoulder,      and pasterns (according to that model of the      picture-perfect dairy goat you've got indelibly etched on      your memory).<br />      <br />      In my unenlightened days, I used to tell livestock shoppers      that the size of the <em>udder</em> was the most important      part of the goat to evaluate. Now, I don't place as much      emphasis on that organ's capacity as I do on some other      characteristics that indicate a milk bag's ability to stay      fit in the future.<br />      <br />      A healthy udder will be firmly attached to a doe's belly by      broad rear and fore ligaments. The milk "factory" should      also be symmetrical and evenly divided from side to side,      with a firmly attached median ligament. And its "handles"      need to be properly shaped. Handsized teats, not huge or      pendulous ones, make for easier milking, leave more room      for the milk-producing part of the udder, and are less      prone to mastitis. I also like to see teats with milk      canals (the passages through which the liquid passes) that      are large enough to allow milking with an easy, rhythmic      squeezing of the fingers.<br />      <br />      Admittedly, udder evaluation is a little difficult when      you're sizing up a doeling that's never been milked.      However, you can get a better idea of how that animal's      udder will probably turn out by checking its mother's      apparatus.<br />      <br />      Actually, you should evaluate Mama (and Papa, too, if you      can find him) all over if you have the opportunity. Once      you've given a doe a thorough once-over, you'll have pretty      good grounds for guessing how her babies will look when      they grow up. Remember to pay special attention to Mama's      size, her "undercarriage", her teeth, and her mammary      system.<br />      <br />      Even more important than a mother goat's appearance,      though, are her milk-production records. How much milk does      she yield annually, and how many kids does she usually      have? Pay particular attention to the animal's <em>length      of</em> lactation as well as to the overall pounds      <em>of</em> liquid produced. You'll want a doe that's going      to keep you in milk throughout her entire ten-month      lactation spell, not one that pumps out a lot <em>of</em>      liquid for four or five months and then dries right up!    </p>    <h3>      HOME, SWEET HOME    </h3>    <p>      Where to keep your newly acquired charges turns out to.be      less complicated than many would-be goat owners want to      believe. A simple three-sided shed that keeps out the wind      and the rain <em>and</em> offers about 15 square feet      <em>of</em> bedding space per adult goat is the best      caprine shelter going. (Aim the open side <em>of</em> the      shed to the south to catch the sun's warming and cleansing      rays.) Unlike what most people suppose, enclosing a goat      barn or adding heat to it <em>increases</em> the chance for      bacteria to grow and flourish. Bacterial pneumonia, in      fact, is quite prevalent among kids kept in stuffy barns.      So the most desirable approach is to keep the shelter      simple and draft-free, yet well ventilated.<br />      <br />      Choosing the right kind <em>of</em> fencing for your goat      pen is every bit as simple as selecting the right kind      <em>of</em> shed. As far as I'm concerned (now), the      <em>only</em> kind <em>of</em> fence for goats is one made      out <em>of</em> commercially available stock panels.      Previously, I recommended welded wire and electric fencing,      but I've since changed my mind. Slippery caprine Houdinis      can wig gle through welded wire fences and can squeeze      under or through electric strands (some even learn how to      <em>time the pulses</em> for a shock-free escape!).<br />      <br />      In contrast, goats can lean or stand against stock panels      without beating them down or pushing them over, and the      sectioned bar ricades are tall enough to contain all but      the most rambunctious breeding buck. The on ly thing I      don't like about such fencing is its cost . . . about $20      per 16-foot panel. How ever, since nothing else quite does      the job, I feel stock panels are worth the expense.<br />      <br />    </p>        <h3>      THERE'S MORE TO COME    </h3>    <p>      Well, that's my list <em>of</em> caprine <em>mea      culpos</em> for this time. In the next issue <em>of</em>      MOTHER, I'll continue my litany <em>of</em> hints and      revisions, covering such subjects as breeding, milking      techniques, raising kids, feeds and feeding schedules, and      at-home health care. So tune in and see how an old vet      really can learn new tricks!<br />      <br />      EDITORS NOTE: Revisions notwithstanding, Randy Kidd's      original article in MOTHER NO. 65, `How to Raise Healthy      Goats", is a thorough discussion of getting started with      dairy goats. For directions on how to order back issues,      turn to page 148.<br />      <br />      <em>In addition, here are some source books that goat      owners (or would-be herders) might find      valuable:</em><br />      <br />      Raising Milk Goats the Modern Way by Ferry Belanger (Garden      Way, $5.95). This paperback, which was written by the      editor and publisher of Countryside <em>magazine, covers      the basics, discusses different breeds, and then don the      i's on various aspects of successful goat keeping. It      should be useful to beginner and old-timer      alike.</em><br />      <br />      Another helpful book-which, like Belanger's, takes the      approach that goats are ideal for homy food production-is      Raising Goats: The Back yard Dairy Alternative by David B.      Weems (Tab, $12.95). This authoritative guide goes into      depth on selecting, raising, caring for, milking, and      breeding goats.<br />      <br />      <em>Finally,</em> The Whole Goat Catalog <em>edited By      Linda S. Campbell (Gerard, $5.95) provides a quick      reference to caprine supplies and service; addresses</em>      of pertinent government agencies, plus basic how-to      herd-management practices.
