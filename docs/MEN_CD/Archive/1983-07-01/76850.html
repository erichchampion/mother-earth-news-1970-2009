                    <h2 id="subtitle">      HOW TO SAVE MONEY ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS    </h2>    <hr />    <h5 id="byline">      by Tom Ferguson, M.D. and Joe Graedon    </h5>        <p>      The amount of money that people could -but don't-save on      drugs boggles the mind! Many folks conscientiously      comparison-shop for such items as cars, washing machines,      and groceries . . . and, as a result, save maybe 10% or 20%      at most on these goods. But it's not uncommon to find      people paying 500% <em>or even 1,000%</em> more than      necessary for prescription drugs! By applying just a little      basic knowledge and consumer awareness, anyone can cut drug      costs. In fact, individuals who take one or more      medications every day-for such chronic conditions as high      blood pressure or arthritis could conceivably save hundreds      of dollars a year.<br />      </p>      <h3>THE PRESCRIPTION PROCESS</h3>     <p>      The first step toward controlling pharmaceutical expenses      is to realize that drug purchase decisions can and      <em>should</em> be made with the bottom line in mind. The      typical patient unquestioningly agrees to the first      medication the doctor suggests, obediently gets the      prescription filled at the nearest pharmacy, and then      uncomplainingly swallows the prescribed drug . . . and the      accompanying bill.<br />      <br />      Seldom do clients ask their doctors in advance what the      cost of their prescriptions will be. And-no matter how high      the tab at the pharmacy-few people ever say, "Hold on!      That's too much!" or ask for a less expensive substitute.      Yet both measures are <em>perfectly within your rights as a      consumer.</em><br />      </p>      <h3>DOCTORS AND DRUG COSTS</h3>     <p>      Many doctors have never once considered price when deciding      on an appropriate drug to administer, since they've had      little or no training in writing cost-effective      prescriptions. If anything, they're biased toward the      high-priced brand-name drugs . . . and no wonder:      Pharmaceutical companies spend over a billion dollars each      year advertising their expensive products to      physicians!<br />      <br />      From the moment they receive their first black bags (free      gifts from drug companies), doctors are subject to      unrelenting promotion. They get deluged with attractive      full color advertisements for brand-name drugs every time      they open a professional journal. At medical meetings-many      of which are sponsored by drug companies-physicians are      surrounded by displays and salespeople, and they're      frequently visited in their offices by drug company      representatives (called "detail men") whose job is to get      the doctors to purchase their firms' products.<br />      <br />      Of course, the expense of all this promotion inevitably      finds its way to the consumer . . . in the price you pay      for prescribed medications. And since little is being done      within the medical profession to make physicians more cost      conscious, it's largely up to you to remind your doctor of      the importance of saving money. Let's examine exactly how      you can take a more active role in determining the price of      your health care.<br />      </p>      <h3>NONDRUG PRESCRIPTIONS</h3>		<p>	      <em>Ask your physician about nondrug treatments.</em>      Suppose, for example, that you've just been diagnosed as      having slightly elevated blood pressure. You and your      doctor might decide that, before trying some medication,      you should see if you can bring your pressure down with a      combination of salt restriction, exercise, relaxation      training, weight loss, and not smoking. After a two- or      three-month trial of these measures, you can then consider      together whether or not you need to add a corrective drug      to your anti-hypertensive regimen. Or, if your chief      complaint is anxiety and insomnia, you and your doctor      might decide that the best first step would be for you to      stop drinking coffee and to take a warm bath before bed      each night. If that doesn't work, <em>then</em> it may be      time to consider an appropriate sleeping pill.<br />      </p>      <h3>PRESCRIPTION OPTIONS</h3>     <p>      Even if you have a problem for which no acceptable non-drug      treatment is available and your doctor suggests a      prescription remedy, there are still several possible      moneysaving measures to explore. For instance, ask your      doctor, <em>"Is there a less expensive-but equally      effective-generic form of this medication?" If,</em> for      example, you have a mild case of hypertension, you and your      physician might agree that drug treatment is necessary. He      or she could write you a prescription for a brand-name drug      which in this case might be Hydrodiuril, the <em>trade      name</em> for hydrochlorothiazide manufactured by Eli Lilly      and Company. On the other hand, the prescription could      specify the <em>generic form</em> of the drug,      hydrochlorothiazide. <em>(All</em> drugs have a generic      name, and may or may not have a brand name as well.)      Generic drugs are, of course, chemically identical to the      brand-name products, but pharmaceutical houses have raised      the point that-because of different filling agents and      packaging processes-two different forms of the same      substance may not have the same clinical effect. For this      reason, some doctors have hesitated to prescribe generic      drugs.<br />      <br />      Now, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has      published a listing of generic drugs, by manufacturer, with      ratings telling whether or not the company has submitted      studies showing that its product meets the FDA's standards      for activity within the body. Your doctor, then, can write      a prescription for the generic form of the drug, specifying      a manufacturer whose product has been FDA approved, so that      both of you can be sure of the drug's effectiveness . . .      while you save money, too.<br />      <br />      Some medications, though, aren't available in generic form.      When a new drug is developed, the producer is granted a      patent on the manufacture of that substance . . . and then      has an exclusive license to make and sell the drug for a      period of 17 years. If you need to take one of these      brand-name only products, your best bet for saving money is      to comparison-shop by phone. Chances are that the price of      a given prescription varies widely in your area.<br />      <br />      Another moneysaving solution, especially for those who know      they'll be taking the same medication for a period of      months or years, is to buy from a discount, mail order      pharmacy. One such concern is Pharmaceutical Services,      Dept. TMEN, 127 West Markey Road, Belton, Missouri 64012.      The company will send you a free price list and order form      on request.<br />      </p>      <h3>ALTERNATIVE DRUGS</h3>     <p>      Here's another key question you can ask your doctor if you      have a condition for which drug treatment seems necessary:      Is <em>there a less expensive alternative drug that 1 could      take instead?</em><br />      <br />      Frequently, doctors choose one medication in favor of      another simply because they think it'll be more convenient      for you to take. For example, the brand-name drug Tagamet      is frequently prescribed for ulcers. It is effective and      convenient (you take one pill two to four times a day), but      it's also <em>expensive.</em> Liquid antacids, on the other      hand, are a bit more bothersome-you need to take them up to      seven times daily, and some people don't like their      taste-but they can be very effective in the treatment of      ulcers, and many are quite inexpensive.<br />      <br />      Doctors sometimes also shy away from certain perfectly good      drugs because they may produce minor, mildly annoying side      effects in some patients. But if you don't happen to get      (or mind) a particular side effect from a given drug, it      may prove to be an excellent and less expensive treatment      for your problem.<br />      </p>      <h3>THE BOTTOM LINE</h3>     <p>      Saving money on drugs is most critical for people on fixed      incomes or limited budgets ... and that includes more and      more of us these days. It may well be worth putting up with      a non-hazardous side effect or a less convenient medication      if you can save $40 to $80 per month. In fact, if you      regularly take several prescription drugs and consequently      have high medical bills, savings on prescription costs can      make a vital difference in your ability to buy food or pay      the rent . . factors that may ultimately be more important      determinants of both emotional and physical health than      <em>any</em> drug!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Pharmacologist Joe Graedon, who co-wrote      this issue's column with Dr. Ferguson, is a contributing      editor for</em> Medical Self-Care <em>magazine and the      author of two excellent consumer guides to prescription and      nonprescription drugs:</em> The People's Pharmacy ($5.95)      <em>and</em> The People's Pharmacy-2 <em>(also</em> $5.95).      <em>Both are published by Avon Books and can be found at      most libraries and bookstores.</em><br />      <br />      Medical Self-Care, <em>Dr. Tom Ferguson's quarterly      journal, is available for $I5 per year from Medical      Self-Care, Dept. TMEN, P.O.Box</em> 717, <em>Inverness,      California</em> 94937. <em>A sample issue costs</em> $4.00.      <em>Dr. Ferguson's book, also titled</em> Medical      Self-Care, <em>can be ordered for</em> $10 postpaid from      the same address.    </p>    <hr />
