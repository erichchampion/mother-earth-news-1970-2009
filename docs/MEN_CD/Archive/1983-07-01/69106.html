                    <h5 id="byline">      by Jan S. Paul    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Prevent the woes-and ills-that surface-water      contamination can bring to your homestead.</em><br />      <br />      Fresh, unpolluted water is essential to our survival. If      you live in a rural area and use a well (whether it be new      or old) it's up to you to check your water source      frequently and to pay careful attention to its maintenance.      Surface contamination often undetectable to the senses of      taste or smell-can occur quickly and without warning.      Properly located and properly cared for, a water well will      give long service... but if you don't know what you're      doing, you can run into a pack of trouble!    </p>        <h3>      BASICS</h3>     <p>      Every well should have an annular (circular) seal, a      concrete slab, and a well casing that extends above the      slab. The annular seal should be at least 6 inches thick,      completely enclosing the casing to a depth of at least 20      feet. The seal-made of cement, bentonite, or any other      approved material-is an absolute <em>must</em> to prevent      surface-water contamination. Many old wells have been lined      with brick. If those clay blocks are glazed and in good      condition, they can be faced with an inch or so of cement      to form a satisfactory seal. Unglazed brick, however, must      be removed and a new seal must be installed.<br />      <br />      In many areas of the country, the natural water table is      only a few feet below the soil surface. Where the water      table is high, a well without adequate sealing is easily      polluted by surface seepage. A new well with a <em>new      casing</em> will be safe from such contamination for a      while . . . but only until it develops the inevitable rust      holes. In the long run, it's less expensive-and less      frustrating-to go ahead and put in a good annular seal than      to have to pull and replace the casing every time it      develops a spot of rust.<br />      <br />      Before being put into use (or reuse), every well should be      tested for minerals, chemicals (particularly nitrate), and      bacteria. After the initial analysis, the well should be      tested once every year.<br />      </p>      <h3>MINERAL/CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION</h3>     <p>      Calcium can't be removed satisfactorily, and the only way      to avoid it is to switch to a different water source. Since      the major hazard of this mineral is fouled pipes, though,      you could try to get by with using the water only at the      well head . . . but this would obviously entail      <em>considerable inconvenience</em> .<br />      <br />      Iron contamination can range from mere unpleasantness to a      downright impossible-to-deal-with nuisance. A potassium      permanganate filter will remove mineral iron down to 2 PPM      (parts per million), which is a satisfactory solution for      coping with suspended particles. However, the problem of      so-called"iron bacteria" is harder to deal with. (These      organisms aren't detrimental to human health. Still, brown      drinking water isn't high on anyone's list of      refreshments.) Your best initial recourse may be to put in      a new pump that's been pretreated with full-strength      swimming pool chlorine. And be sure to flush clean all the      tools used in removing the old pump, because iron bacteria      can adhere to almost anything, including your hands! If the      problem persists in spite of the pump change and chlorine      flushing, a chlorinator or chemical feeder may be the      answer . . . that, or a new well.<br />      <br />      Perhaps the most hazardous surface-water chemical to look      out for is <em>nitrate.</em> An old well that tests high in      it suggests human or livestock contamination, because      nitrate is the natural product of decaying sewage, animal      waste, and garbage. You may be able to solve the problem by      drilling a new well and putting in a good annular seal, but      if the nitrate <em>still</em> tests out at more than 45      mg/liter (or 45 PPM), you shouldn't use the water.<br />      <br />      Why is there such a big fuss over nitrate? For one thing,      it can cause methemoglobinemia, which impairs the      oxygen-transporting mechanism in the human bloodstream.      Young children are particularly susceptible to this      condition. In addition, nitrate-by <em>itself-is</em> a      suspected carcinogen: Studies have shown a higher incidence      of stomach cancer fatalities in those people drinking      high-nitrate water.<br />      <br />      Obviously, if the nitrate is the result of a natural soil      or water table condition, it can't be eliminated, so you'll      have to obtain your water from an entirely different      source. That's very unfortunate . . . but methemoglobinemia      and stomach cancer are nothing to take chances with.<br />      </p>      <h3>ORGANIC CONTAMINATION</h3>     <p>      Living organisms of the coli-aerogenes group-the one most      commonly found in water can be eliminated by      treatment.<br />      <br />      Wells should be checked frequently for evidence of these      harmful bacteria.<br />      <br />      To counteract such organic contamination, first clean the      well. To do this, flush the pressure tank (if the system      has one), then add chlorine directly to the well: three      gallons of chlorine bleach with 5% sodium hypochlorite will      cleanse the casing and lines of a 6- to 8-inch well.<br />      <br />      Once that chemical's added, immediately turn on the pump.      Fill the pressure tank-assuming you have one-then open all      the spigots and run them until the water at every faucet      smells of chlorine. If your setup has no pressure tank,      simply pump water out of the well until the chemical is      reaching the entire system. Allow the chlorine to remain in      all your lines at least 12 hours . . . or longer, if      possible. (While the chlorine is in the system, pipes can      be checked for minute leaks by the "smell test".)<br />      <br />      To put the system back into operation, open all the faucets      and let water run until the chlorine smell is no longer      noticeable. Wait two weeks, then have another sample      tested. If there is still a problem, repeat the chlorine      treatment.<br />      <br />      If the procedure outlined above doesn't eliminate the      bacteria, you'll need to check the well itself. Pull the      pump, if it's on top, and inspect the condition of the      casing by catching sunlight in a hand-held mirror and      shining it down the cavity (or by using an automobile      headlight wired to the battery of a nearby car). If you see      holes in the lining, it should be replaced and the well      should be sealed properly.<br />      <br />      If, however, the casing looks all right, the well may have      to be blown out with compressed air. This will help if the      contamination stems from animal remains . . . such as those      of mice, slugs, or snails that are in the water. Repeat the      chlorine treatment if you replaced a defective casing or      blew out a contaminated well. Finally, if everything else      fails, drill a new well.<br />      <br />      Be sure, if you do, to follow the safety measures outlined      above ... and have your well water tested every year. The      welfare of you and your family may be at stake!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Most county health departments will test      your well water for the contaminants discussed above . . .      for a small fee. Because this article dealt with      surface-water problems, it did not cover</em> toxic      chemical <em>pollution</em> ... <em>which generally comes      from</em> ground-water <em>contamination.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Since we ran our article on that topic, "Toxic      Chemicals and Drinking Water" (see page 26 of issue 80),      we've learned</em> of <em>a company that does</em> detailed      <em>testing of water for a very reasonable price. WaterTest      Corporation, Dept. TMEN, Box 186, New London, New Hampshire      03257 will test water samples for 12 inorganic chemicals,      total organic halide content (which includes pesticides and      toxic chemicals), coliform bacteria, chlorides, manganese,      iron, pH, and total hardness for a cost of only $35, plus      postage.</em><br />      <br />      <em>At this time, we have already submitted samples to      Water Test Corporation. We'll report in more detail about      their service in the next issue of MOTHER.</em>    </p>    <hr />
