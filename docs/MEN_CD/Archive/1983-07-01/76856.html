                    <hr />    <h3>      ORGANIC FARMING MAKES A COMEBACK    </h3>    <p>      The defunct Organic Farming Act of 1982 is making a      comeback as the Agricultural Productivity Act of 1983. Last      year's bill died on the House floor when the measure came      up before its backers could generate sufficient support in      Congress. But this year's proposal, which is worded in more      conservative language and accompanied by a well-coordinated      lobbying effort, has received unprecedented support in      <em>both</em> legislative chambers.<br />      <br />      The Productivity Act-which was introduced in the House by      Oregon Democrat James Weaver and in the Senate by Vermont      Democrat Patrick Leahy-provides funds to [1] study the      transition of 12 farms from energy-intensive operations to      organic production (using water- and energy-conservation      techniques and natural fertilizers) . . . [2] analyze the      productivity of farms that have used conservation methods      for the last five years . . . [3] establish programs to pay      part of farmers' costs for natural fertilizers and      soil-erosion control . . . and [4] direct the U.S.      Department of Agriculture (which has slashed its organic      farming research) to reexamine existing extension      materials.<br />      <br />      "Until recently," says FOE's pesticide campaign      coordinator, Bob Scowcroft, "a good deal of the public      perceived organic farmers as a bunch of naked hippies in      California. But this image is changing as organic farming      is becoming a $100 million-per-year business. Superfarms      may still have higher yields, but after borrowing [money]      at 15 to 20% to cover costs, their owners frequently come      out in the red . . . while organic farmers often come out      in the black."<br />      <br />      It's not likely that the Productivity Act will shake the      foundations of U.S. agriculture. But it <em>should,</em> if      passed, help in making sustainable agriculture recognized      as a profitable and environmentally sound method of      farming. Apparently, Congress thinks so, since the bill has      51 cosponsors in the House and 13 in the Senate (as      compared to a total of less than 20 for 1982's      measure).<br />      <br />      The bill was scheduled for hearings in late May or early      June, but action may be delayed: Contact your      Representative about HR 2714 and your Senators about S 1128      to solicit their support.<br />      </p>      <h3>DIGGING WISCONSIN</h3>     <p>      Midwestern environmentalists, local officials, and      representatives of several Indian tribes have banded      together (as the Wisconsin Resources Protection Council) to      fend off powerful mining interests in the region. And not a      moment too soon . . . 20 large corporations have already      bought or leased about 400,000 acres in the area.<br />      <br />      Exxon Corporation is leading the fray with its plans to      develop what could be the world's largest copper and zinc      lode near Crandon, Wisconsin, only two miles west of a      Chippewa Indian reservation. In fact, the Chippe was      recently learned that Exxon hopes to be able to use part of      their <em>reservation</em> for the project! The wastes from      such a mining operation would threaten the tribe's water      system, including the wild rice wetlands that are their      major source of livelihood. Exxon's alternative disposal      solutions are not being met with open arms, either, so the      company is likely to get heavy opposition from the 80      different community groups that are resisting the      plan.<br />      <br />      For more information, contact FOE's Lake Superior Region      Office, Dept.

Box 224, Holcombe, Wisconsin      54745.<br />      </p>      <h3>THE ROARING MOUSE</h3>     <p>      The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) ran upon the shoals of      the growing antinuclear movement in the Pacific recently,      when their proposal for a treaty-the Compact of Free      Association-with the 15,000 people of the Palau Islands was      not warmly received. It seems that the DOD is willing to      offer Palau $1.2 billion in aid over the next 50 years . .      . in return for the use of about a third of the islands'      territory for military bases and weapons storage.<br />      <br />      Palau's three-year-old constitution has the world's first      provision <em>banning</em> the storage, testing, and      disposal of nuclear and toxic materials. What's more, a      February election reiterated that stand when the islanders      rejected the portion of the DOD's proposal concerning      nuclear materials. The department is now suggesting that      the Palauans <em>change</em> their constitution to suit the      terms of the compact . . . a proposal that's not      particularly popular with the residents.<br />      <br />      For more information, contact the U.S. Nuclear Free Pacific      Network, Dept. TMEN, 942 Market Street, San Francisco,      California 94102.<br />      </p>      <h3>WHOSE JOBS BILL?</h3>     <p>      Though the $4.6 billion jobs bill passed by Congress and      signed by President Reagan is expected to provide work for      only 2.8Â°70 of the nation's 14 million unemployed, it      does contain some worthwhile proposals from an      environmental point of view. The piece of legislation      allocates $100 million for low income home weatherization .      . . another $50 million for school and hospital      weatherization . . . $229 million for mass transit      assistance funds . . . $40 million for the Land and Water      Conservation Fund . . . $50 million for Small Business      Administration urban forestry grants ... $25 million for      historic preservation programs . . . and $40 million for      restoration of city parks.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, there was also some traditional pork barrel      fat added to the bill, which absorbs about <em>half</em> of      the funds. The Department of Agriculture gets $700 million      dollars for rural sewer development, a prime motivator of      urban sprawl. And $100 million goes to the Soil      Conservation Service for digging out stream channels (which      is officially designated "flood protection"). Amazingly      enough, $505 million is committed to the Army Corps of      Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation for <em>building      dams!</em><br />      <br />      Environmentalists lobbied heavily to reduce the amount of      funds going to the Corps and the Bureau. And, in fact,      Senators John Chafee and Daniel Moynihan offered an      amendment to cut $188 million and $21.7 million,      respectively, from the two agencies. Their proposal also      provided that most of these funds ($200 million) would go      instead to the EPA <em>municipal</em> sewer construction      grant program. The Senators based their recommended cut in      the Corps' budget on Army statements that it couldn't spend      all the money it received last year(!) . . . while the      $21.7 million Bureau deletion would still have left them      with their original supplementary budget proposal for      February 1983. Both agencies, however, rallied to the task      of using the extra money . . . and the Chafee Moynihan      amendment was defeated.<br />      </p>      <h3>NUCLEAR UPS AND DOWNS</h3>     <p>      As many of you probably know, on April 17 the Supreme Court      ruled that possible psychological stress on nearby      residents need not be considered as a restraint to      restarting ,_ Three Mile Island's undamaged Unit I reactor.      But in another high-court ruling, California's moratorium      on the construction of new nuclear plants (until a method      of safe waste disposal is established) was <em>upheld.</em>      This decision is a significant blow to the growth of the      nuclear industry . . . although it doesn't affect the 80      operating plants or 58 others already under way.<br />      <br />      The Reagan Administration has speeded up the search for a      waste disposal site for the 8,000 tons of used fuel and the      thousands of tons left over from weapons production. The      Nuclear Policy Act of 1982 dictates that a site will be      chosen by 1987 and put into operation by 1998 in one of the      following states: Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas,      Utah, or Washington. There's no guarantee, however, that      the selected site will be welcomed by the residents of the      state , . . and any of the states can <em>veto</em> the      selection unless both houses of Congress override that      decision.<br />      <br />      Quite obviously, then, the resolution of the waste disposal      problem is a very "iffy" matter. Who knows? It may just      prove to be the final nail in the coffin of the nuclear      industry.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to become a member of the      worldwide organization Friends of the Earth, and/or receive      their excellent paper</em> Not Man Apart, fill <em>out the      coupon below, and mail it with your check to: Friends of      the Earth, Dept.
