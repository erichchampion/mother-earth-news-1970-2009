                    <h5 id="byline">      by Joseph R. Brown    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Where there's a wheel, there's a way. And with just a      few more odds and ends, you can make . . .</em><br />      <br />      I'm all for a bargain . . . so when I spotted an old seed      cleaner that looked to be in pretty good shape, I couldn't      resist picking it up for a song. But when I got it home, I      began whistling a different tune. A bearing had turned on      the main fan shaft, wearing a neat-but      unwanted-groove deep into the steel rod<br />      (see Photo 1).    </p>        <p>      Replacing the cold-rolled shaft would have cost as much as      the implement itself, though, and I was determined to make      a repair with the tools and materials I had on hand: an      oxyacetylene torch, some brazing rod, and the contents of      an impressive pile of wood and metal scraps I'd collected      over the years.<br />      <br />      What I lacked, however, was a <em>lathe</em> to turn down      and smooth out the brass fill that I'd be using to build up      the score. I decided to use the shaft itself-with the      bearings and pulleys attached to it-as a crude setup that,      I hoped, would spin "true" enough to permit me to do an      accurate finishing job.<br />      <br />      To start (see Photo 2), I made a solid base by laying a      10-foot section of 14" X 14" railroad lumber on top of, and      at right angles to, a 2 X 12 plank. Then, using the      position of the shaft's bearings as a guide, I nailed in a      couple of 16-long 2 X 6 uprights-one to the side of the      timber, and the other along the far end of the plank-to      serve as mounts for the bearing flanges. (I had to add some      wood scraps as spacers between the "outside" upright and      the railroad beam, for extra strength.)<br />      <br />      It took me only a few minutes to brace the "freestanding"      upright with a couple of 1 X 4 stringers set at 45Â°      angles. Then I constructed a motor mount by nailing 2-foot      hunks of 2 X 6 across the top of the large timber, parallel      to the shaft and about a foot or so from it. They also had      to be "proud" by 10 or 12 inches on one side so the motor's      pulley could line up with the shaft's.<br />      <br />      The rest was simple: I bolted the shaft's bearing flanges      to the ends of the uprights (the bearings on this machine      were the self-aligning type, so everything didn't have to      be <em>perfectly</em> lined up), dug a 1/3-horsepower      electric motor out of my scrap pile, and borrowed one of      the V-belts from the seed cleaner's drive system. Next, I      bolted the motor on its 2 X 6 platform, with the belt      stretched in position.<br />      <br />      That done, I let 'er rip to see if the whole shebang would      turn smoothly. It did, so I shut down, got out my torch,      and filled the scored out groove with enough brass rod to      more than pack the worn channel (as shown in Photo      3).<br />      <br />      Another trip to my junk pile rewarded me with a 3/8" X 1"      steel bar that was long enough to span the distance between      the two wooden uprights. I nailed that in place on top of      those posts-in line with the shaft (but not quite touching      it)-to serve as a tool rest . . . and got to work.<br />      <br />      The most convenient cutting tool I could come up with was a      worn-out 10" file, which I modified by grinding its end      into a sharp, round-nosed tip. I soon learned from      experience to feed the tool very slowly into the built-up      fill (see Photo 4), or it would grab on the rough spots . .      . and I found, too, that it paid to clean up the file's      cutting edge frequently. Naturally, I wore eye protection      throughout the cutting and grinding processes.<br />      <br />      As I began approaching the shaft's actual diameter, I      checked my progress with a straightedge laid along the      rod's length. Then I used the face of a fine file to dress      the t:!1. and finished smoothing 'er up with some      extra-fine emery cloth.<br />      <br />      Since I didn't have a micrometer, I simply used the      replacement bearing collar as a "fit to size" guide. When      it slipped onto my repair work with a couple of moderate      taps, I knew I was right in the ballpark.<br />      <br />      Though many folks would probably have taken the job to a      machine shop, I took pride in the fact that I'd done      something with just about nothing (Photo 5) . . . and that      my final product (see Photo 6) turned out to be as neat as      any shopwork you'd care to see!    </p>    <hr />
