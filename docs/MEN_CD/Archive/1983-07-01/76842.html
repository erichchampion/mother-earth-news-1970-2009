                    <hr />    <p>      <em>In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of humankind's better ideas barter-and made      an interesting suggestion: "1'd like to see a continuing      feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said      Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for      contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied .      . . and announced our still-standing offer: Send us a short      account of an actual barter (write Successful Swaps, THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>Â°, 105 Stoney Mountain Road,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791), and if we print it      in this column, you'll you'll receive a 12month      subscription (new or extended) to MOTHER.</em><br />      <br />      My partner and I use llamas as pack animals in our summer      hiking business in the high Cascades <em>of</em> Oregon,      and-as a result have learned <em>a lot</em> about training      and handling these animals.<br />      <br />      Well, our expertise resulted in the first of two great      swaps we made this past year! A local breeder traded us two      young male llamas in return for our giving shots and worm      medicine to his seldom-treated female critters. He now has      a healthier herd and is rid of animals he had no use for,      while we have a couple of nice males to train for our use      or to sell.<br />      <br />      Our second exchange occurred when our well pump broke down.      We discovered that the local well expert was willing to      pull and reinsert the unit in exchange for a summer pack      trip. (We did have to pay to have the pump      <em>repaired,</em> but still saved several hundred dollars      in removal and installation charges.)<br />      <br />      Who'd have ever thought that owning llamas could give us      such barter power?!     </p>     <h3>T.L. Oregon</h3>     <p>      My husband and I know you get many letters describing the      experiences of people who care for homes in exchange for      shelter - or barter labor for land-but we think our      arrangement is unique (and hope you'll feel the      same).<br />      <br />      You see, we came to Fairbanks because the university here      is (in our opinion) the best in the 49th state, but we soon      discovered that the usual college housing crunch was      compounded by the area's rapid population growth      <em>and</em> the influx <em>of</em> summer inhabitants.      After trying dome tent living (for three weeks) and renting      an overpriced one room cabin (for a month), we were      claustrophobic and desperate!<br />      <br />      We had enough money to <em>build</em> a small cabin for      ourselves, but not enough to buy the land for it. However,      we found a prospective site only five miles from the      university, and when we inquired about using it-the owners      were both surprised and intrigued by our proposal:      <em>If</em> they'd allow us to build a cabin on their land      and live in it for the duration <em>of</em> our schooling      (three years), they-in turn-would be given sole ownership      <em>of</em> the structure when we left. (We knew we could      build the dwelling for less than a single year's rent at      the area's going rates.)<br />      <br />      The landowners mulled over our proposition and then made a      generous counteroffer. They said they'd provide an even      better piece <em>of</em> land, <em>and</em> would buy the      building materials for the house that would eventually be      theirs.<br />      <br />      You can imagine our excitement and delight! We immediately      accepted the deal, set to work constructing our home, and      moved in five weeks later. Now, we have a place to live for      as long as we need it . . . and our landlords own a      well-built cabin, which cost them about <em>half</em> the      price they would have otherwise had to pay.    </p>    <h3>L. D. Alaska</h3>    <p>      This story isn't about one <em>of</em> MOTHER's more      <em>usual</em> swaps, but it does show how she inspires      others, and that she isn't alone in extolling barter these      days. At Monroe Community College in Rochester, New York,      our program in Human Ecology includes a course called      "Self-Reliance", in which we study and have hands-on      experience in food self-sufficiency . . . alternative      energy and shelter . . . and barter.<br />      <br />      One week during the semester we hold a bazaar that gives      the class a chance to actually engage in trading. We also      discuss deals reported in Successful Swaps, ask each      student to assemble a list <em>of</em> his or her      barterable goods and skills, and circulate the results.      Since the students are already, by that time, involved in      other constructive projects, many of them end up      horse-trading such things as goose eggs for black walnut      seedlings . . . wood ashes for old storm windows . . . or      raspberry plants for tools. We may strike as many as 30      such deals in a week!<br />      <br />      In addition, our barter days teach the students to recycle      rather than discard . . . give them useful goods to take      home from class . . . and demonstrate that self-reliance      <em>without</em> wealth is possible.<br />      <br />      Here are some other swaps that we made this past semester:      a set of sheets for a sampling <em>of</em> iris bulbs,      children's books for a theater ticket, a record album for      compost, herbs for transportation, plant clippings for a      magazine, and a haircut for a bicycle repair job. And at      the start of the semester, I made a deal with an      enterprising young lady who wanted to sit in on the class      unofficially . . . yesterday she gave us all a yoga lesson!    </p>    <h3>      M.G.B. New York</h3>    <p>      When my wife and I decided to chuck tra ditional employment      and try making it on our own, we knew we'd have to pare our      budget to the bone. And since we didn't want to give up our      weekly visits to the lo cal foreign film theater, it      occurred to us that we might be able to help the proprietor      with his monthly mailings.    </p>    <p>      It seems that the gentleman had been hand addressing      several hundred movie schedules every four weeks . . . so      we proposed that we'd keep his mailing list in our home      computer and print a monthly set of computer-generated      address labels for him, in exchange for free movie      tickets.<br />      <br />      He accepted our offer, and now we get free movies and      popcorn . . . in return for an hour or two of effort and a      couple of dollars' worth of blank labels.    </p>    <h3>      B.M. New Mexico    </h3>     <p>      This isn't just another "babysitting swap" story, but      admittedly, the idea did spring from our ten-mother group,      which was originally organized for that purpose!    </p>    <p>      What with times being hard, you see, we've also started a      clothing and toy exchange. It operates on a one-for-one      rule (one article of clothing for another or for a toy, or      a toy for a blanket, etc.), the only stipulation being that      each item <em>must</em> be in good repair. In other words,      we encourage people to swap what their children have      outgrown, <em>not</em> items that they've worn out!<br />      <br />      Furthermore, the enterprise has been so successful that      we're now discussing expanding the concept into a barter      day . . . that would be open to anyone and advertised in      the garage sale section of our local paper. (Anything we      have left over would then be donated to a charity.)<br />      <br />      Our group activities give three benefits: access to a      community of women, some welcome scheduled time to      ourselves, and 'i "new" clothing and toys for our growing      children . . . all without one penny being exchanged!    </p>    <h3>      G.H . Illinois</h3>     <p>      At a recent yard sale, I spied a lathe that I thought would      make a splendid addition to my husband's workshop and-at      the same event-noticed a set of six lovely, old oak chairs      without their cane seats.    </p>    <p>      After investigating the prices, though, I knew I couldn't      <em>afford</em> the lathe, but I was considering buying the      chairs . . . since I cane as a hobby and was aware that the      repaired furnishing would bring a good price.<br />      <br />      As I was deliberating, the homeowner came over to chat. He      told me that the chairs had been in his family for a long      time . . . and that he really <em>didn't</em> want to sell      them, but figured he might as well because he'd never been      able to afford to have them recaned.<br />      <br />      Well, you guessed it! My husband now has a lathe, and      <em>I'm</em> weaving new seats for six family heirlooms.    </p>    <h3>      E.D. New Hampshire    </h3>    <hr />
