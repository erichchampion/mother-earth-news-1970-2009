        <p><em>Quick, before market day rolls around, start training your . .</em></p><hr /><p>That's right, "self-loading pigs" . . . you read it correctly! Believe it or not, swine that waltz right into a pickup truck really do exist. I should know: I've been raising self-loaders for several years now on my farm in Maine. Of course, I have to admit that it took me a while to realize that it's <em>possible</em> to rear such a well-mannered strain of porkers. Like many pig-raising homesteaders, I used to spend <em>at least</em> one entire day every fall running through-and wallowing in-deep, dark, rich ("eau de pig") mud . . . all because I was attempting to force my wild, stubborn, cantankerous, and infuriating squealers into the back of my truck, so that I could get them to market!<br /><br />In those unenlightened years, I tried <em>backing</em> (using the "bushel-basket over the head" routine) . . . pulling (grabbing an animal by its tail or even its ears) . . . lifting (futilely) <em>... waiting</em> (endlessly) ... and <em>pleading</em> (desperately). In short, I tried every method I could think of to make those exasperating critters obey me! Then, finally, at the end of one particularly harrowing loading day during my third year as a pig farmer, I suddenly remembered what my wise of pork-lovin' father used to do.<br /></p><h3>"TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL"</h3><p>Dad owned and operated a large hog farm (over 500 head) in Milford, Massachusetts back in the 40's. And-although most of his spread now lies under Interstate 495-I can still visualize what it used to look like. I can see the way those animal yards were laid out, and how my father would just back up his truck to one of them . . . load up 25 to 50 pigs . . . and be off to Brighton Stockyards in a matter of minutes. His secret, as I recall, was <em>Pavlovian conditioning.</em> He simply trained his stock (as he reared them) to do exactly what he wanted them to do . . . which was to climb a loading ramp and "hop" into his truck!<br /><br />You see, as soon as the piglets were weaned, they were put in a fenced acre lot. Their food was placed on a raised, railing-enclosed platform. In order to reach their slop, then, the youngsters were required to scale the created ramp that led up from the mud lot ;u the "mess hall". (Needless to say, the upper level was constructed to resemble-and fit snugly against-the back of my father's truck.) The rest is obvious. Dad's porkers learned at a very early age that at mealtime they had to ascend a plank to a simulated truck bed . . . or they didn't eat. Market day was just like any other day to the pigs, except that this time supper was placed on the back of a real vehicle, so the full-grown hogs had to take five or ten more steps than usual to get to their feed.<br /></p><h3>SIMPLE THEORY</h3><p>If this is your first season as a pig rearer, you may not realize that swine spuok easily . . . and, once excited, they can become frantic, irrational beasts. Just take my word for it: If your pigs have never had to climb up a ramp before, they're sure not likely to scamper up one on market day just to please you. No sir, they must be <em>conditioned</em> (or, more accurately, outsmarted) to <em>want</em> to do this.<br /><br />It seems that, as human beings, we certainly should be capable of guiding a few domestic animals from one point to another, no matter how crafty they are or how much weight they can throw around . . . without our having to resort to the use of brute force. Nevertheless, every market day, as I watch my gentle porkers amiably ambling up their ramp and on into my truck, I once again marvel that self-loading pigs really do exist!</p><hr />
