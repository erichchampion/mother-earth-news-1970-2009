                <p>      <em><strong>Here's a business requiring little investment      and less overhead!</strong></em> <strong>Mike      Abrams</strong>    </p>            <p>      A little over a year ago, my wife and I opened a      one-day-a-week secondhand store ... and ever since then      we've been having a ball, recycling other folks' rummage      into <em>our</em> bill-paying money! And you can do the      same, with no more than just a bit of spare time ... a      modicum of junking know-how (I'd done a little yard-sale      "dealing" in college) ... a hearty enjoyment of people ...      <em>and</em> a strong desire to work for yourself    </p>    <p>      Lorraine and I got involved in this business as a result of      visiting someone else's backyard flea market. It was at the      end of the day, and we were among the last customers to      leave. I happened to notice that the poor fellow holding      the sale still had a lot of unsold merchandise, and thought      what a shame it'd be for him to have to box up all that      potentially profitable junk and cart it up to an attic      corner (or, worse yet, to the dump). So, mustering up all      the good horse-trading sense that my granddaddy'd taught      me, I said I'd take all that" trash" off his hands for      $5.00. Apparently no stranger to the art of haggling      himself, the man said I could have it for $10.00. Well, I      was amazed that he even <em>considered</em> my low offer      ... but I didn't let my surprise get in the way of my      haggling, and wound up paying him $8.00 for the entire lot.    </p>    <h3>A PLACE OF BUSINESS</h3>    <p>      At any rate, before we knew it, my wife and I had our      pickup loaded with several hundred pounds of marketable      goodies! The next question was what to do with the loot.      Our house was, we felt, located too far out of town to      attract enough yard-sale customers.    </p>    <p>      Finally-after careful deliberation-we came up with the plan      to <em>rent</em> a warehouse cubicle in town and hold our      sale there. (That way we'd have the benefit of a centrally      located retail store without the usual high overhead.) So      we scouted around and found a dry, clean, <em>lighted</em>      (if <em>we</em> supplied the bulb) 5' X 15' space for only      $20 a month. And once we checked with the management to      make sure we could <em>market</em> as well as house our      goods on the premises (some places where we inquired      objected to the idea), we unloaded and began to set up      shop.    </p>    <p>      Since we'd already invested the rental money, we decided to      get cracking and hold our first sale the very next weekend.      So, after securing our merchandise with a $3.00 padlock, we      traipsed off to the local newspaper office and took out a      classified ad to let folks know about our "shop warming".      And remembering what a good deal we'd made with our first      "middleman", we took out a second ad that read, "We buy      yardsale leftovers," and gave our phone number. At 10  cents      a word, the total cost of our advertising was a mere $2.00.    </p>    <p>      Over the course of the following week, we spent several      hours sorting, cleaning, fixing up, and pricing our junk.      Then, early on the morning of our sale, we drove to      welltraveled intersections near our warehouse and put up      hand-lettered signs (with arrows and directions) so no one      could miss us! This done, we went back and arranged our      merchandise-outside-on folding tables that we'd borrowed      from friends.    </p>    <h3>THE PROOF'S IN THE PROFIT</h3>    <p>      All our preparation paid off, too ... because from the      moment we opened up till well past 2:00 p.m., we had a      steady flow of bargain hunters. Finally (once the rush had      slowed to an occasional latecomer), we packed the leftovers      back into the warehouse and counted our money. There was      plenty to count, too ... all in all we took in about $80,      which left us with a profit of $47! Our sale was a success.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, when we got home, the phone was practically      ringing off the hook with calls from people eager to get      rid of <em>their</em> yard-sale rejects! We ended up      spending another $50 on "new" merchandise ... but that was      fine with us, because our "storefront" rent was paid up for      three more weeks!    </p>    <p>      That first sale took place over a year ago ... and my      hardworking spouse and I have been happily dealing junk      ever since! We still spend only one or two days a week      working at our enterprise, buteven soour reputation and      profits (we currently net over $200 a month) have grown,      and we now have an established clientele ... a      professionally printed sign <em>and</em> business cards ...      and plans to transfer our shop to a more permanent      location: the shed behind our home. (Now that we have      regular customers who say they wouldn't mind the long      drive, that move could increase our net by making monthly      warehouse fees unnecessary.)    </p>    <h3>TIPS FOR FELLOW JUNKERS</h3>    <p>      To save any folks who'd like to follow our example a few      headaches (and, perhaps, heartaches as <strong>well), here      are some</strong> lessons we learned the      <strong>hard</strong> way.    </p>    <p>      <strong>[11 Leave your phone number with the proprietor of      any yard sale you think you</strong> might later      <strong>want to buy out ... and make</strong> a quick list      <strong>(including prices) of the items</strong> on    </p>    <p>      display. Then, if the seller does call, you'll have an idea      of how much his/her remaining goods are worth. (Also, be      sure to say when you'll be home to receive the phone call      ... and then <em>be there!)</em>    </p>    <p>      [2] While making your junking rounds, never pass up a good      buy in the morning, hoping that you'll be able to purchase      it for less later in the day ... because chances are that      by afternoon it'll be gone! We lost a lovely oak rocker      this way ... whereas quick action once allowed us to snap      up a 5,000-BTU air conditioner for a mere $15, an appliance      that we later sold for $125!    </p>    <p>      [31 The price you pay for an article and what you turn      around and <em>charge</em> for it are up to you. Just think      of the people from whom you buy as wholesalers, and your      business as a retail establishment ... and then buy and      mark up accordingly.    </p>    <p>      [4] You'll get a good idea of what sort of merchandise      sells and what doesn't <em>(and of</em> what prices are      appropriate) if you attend as many flea markets and garage      sales as your time allows.    </p>    <p>      [5] When you get ready to peddle your used wares, it's a      good idea to price everything (with tags) before your sale      starts. Later-during the confusion of dealing with      customers-you might forget how much you'd decided something      was worth ... and that memory lapse could cost you money!    </p>    <p>      [6] Make your business a cash-and-carry operation. Checks      can be a real nuisance ... especially if they bounce! (We      have a sign that says, "Barter Welcome, Cash Accepted,      Checks ... NO WAY!")    </p>    <p>      [71 And finally, to avoid possible IRS hassles, get in the      habit of writing out a receipt, and keeping the carbon      copy, for <em>each item</em> you sell ... no matter how      small and insignificant it may seem.    </p>    <p>      There's more I could tell you ... but none of it can      compare with what you'll pick up when you start a home junk      trade and discover your own reasons for turning one      person's trash into another's treasure!    </p>
