Used by permission.    </p>    <p>      <em>Why keep your flower garden and the vegetable plot      separated? Many plants are both attractive</em> <em>and      tasty, allowing you to surround your home with an "edible      landscape" Consider</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by Kate Rogers Gessert    </h5>        <p>      For some years now I've been experimenting with the use of      food plant varieties as <em>decorative</em> additions to my      garden. My ideal dualpurpose fruit or vegetable would be      attractive in leaf, in flower, <em>and</em> in fruit. It      would also be tasty and have a long harvest season.      Furthermore, this versatile "dream" variety could be grown      in combination with strictly ornamental trees and shrubs or      in a largely edible landscape composed primarily of      flowers, vegetables, fruits, and nuts.    </p>    <p>      As you'd imagine, few food plants meet <em>all</em> these      criteria. However, kale is one vegetable that does satisfy      a good many of them. In fact, this hardy and healthful      green can be either an ornamental food plant <em>or</em> a      valuable contribution to a nondecorative vegetable garden.    </p>    <h3>WINTER GREENS</h3>    <p>      Kale <em>(Brassica oleracea acephala),</em> a full-leaved      member of the cabbage family, is similar to broccoli in      growing habit <em>and</em> culinary use. And, since kale is      quite winter-hardy, it can withstand temperatures below      freezing (some varieties to as low as <em>-</em>      10°F!), and, if lightly protected, will continue to      thrive during the cold season in many parts of the country.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dwarf</em> varieties grow in neat compact clusters that      can reach 1-1/2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Their finely      curled leaves are usually bluish green in color, and make      for tasty garden greens when harvested. In cold climates,      the plants often stop growing in late fall and resume in      early spring.    </p>    <p>      <em>Nondwarf</em> varieties have loose, tall growth. Their      leaves are less ornate than are those of dwarf kale ... and      they tend to be a duller green. Because the plants are tall      and lanky, however, with their leaves held well above the      soil, they're better protected from intense groundlevel      freezes than are the dwarfs.    </p>    <h3>PLANTING AND CULTIVATION</h3>        <p>      Kale grows best in a rich soil that's been well fertilized.      The seed can be sown from early spring to late summer ...      but July or August plantings (for fall and winter      harvesting) are especially popular, since kale's flavor      improves when the leaves are exposed to relatively mild      (above 20°F) frosts. (This vegetable can tolerate hot      weather, too, but its leaves may become tough.) It likes      full sun ... but will also manage fairly well in partial      shade.    </p>    <p>      You can plant your own leafy greens, using seeds or starts,      as soon as the ground can be worked. Either way, choose a      sunny spot for them and water the patch well. Sow the      curly-leaved types thinly in a seedbed and then transplant      the little shoots when the danger of frost is past, setting      them 18 inches apart. You'll find that plainleaved      varieties do best if they are not transplanted, and such      seeds should be sown directly in the ground in early      spring.    </p>    <h3>PEST CONTROL</h3>    <p>      Even though kale is extremely hardy and has a built-in      resistance to clubroot-one of the cabbage clan's most      unpleasant ailments <em>-</em> the leafy vegetable      <em>can</em> be overrun with pests. Cabbageworms and aphids      are its two most common attackers. Fortunately, the cab      worms' holes will be fairly inconspicuous in the frilly      rosettes of dwarf kale. So if you grow the plants strictly      for <em>ornamental</em> use, it's best to keep in mind that      the curly leaves will show damage less than plain ones.    </p>    <p>      But what about the gardener who <em>-</em> because he      or she is concerned with food value as well as beauty      <em>-</em> wants to keep plant damage a minimum?      Well, there are a few steps such a grower can take to      prevent a heavy infestation.    </p>        <p>      First of all, try to raise your own plants from seed, or at      least buy them from a <em>local</em> farm or nursery. If      you do so, you can be reasonably sure your seedlings won't      be infected <em>before you</em> plant them. Then see that      your kale patch is rich in humus and properly drained. A      healthy plant will have the best chance of defeating pests      and diseases. Furthermore, you can protect your seedlings      from birds by covering the patch with a fine nylon netting      or mesh. This won't harm our feathered friends, but it will      keep them away from the new greenery. Finally, practice      yearly crop rotation to help insure that a pest or disease      doesn't return more often than once in several years.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE. Bacillus thuringiensis is, of course,      effective against cabbageworms.]</em>    </p>    <h3>LET THEM STRUT THEIR STUFF</h3>    <p>      Dwarf kale plants look great when used to line a path or      provide a border for a flowerbed. If you plan to harvest      winter greens, planting your kale alongside a path makes      picking an easy job in bad weather. You might also want to      experiment with growing kale near other frilly or      fine-textured foliage. The dense heads will easily hold      their own against big, bold plants. They combine nicely      with almost any shade of green, and will complement the      colors of your favorite flowers, as well.    </p>    <p>      In the fall, kale can serve as a mild-colored background      for a bright display of asters and chrysanthemums ... or      its own flashier relative, flower kale. In spring, it will      look good as a decorative companion for flowering bulbs      (such as tall snowdrop, crocus, star-of-the-snow, daffodil,      and hyacinth), as well as for early-blooming shrubs      (including cornelian cherry, winter jasmine, forsythia,      star magnolia, and quince). You can also plant kale around      the base of deciduous trees that hold their fruit in winter      or bloom in early spring (some crab apples do both), or      place them in front of evergreens as a lighter-shaded      contrast to the conifers' deep blues and greens.    </p>    <h3>A HEALTHFUL HARVEST</h3>    <p>      Chopped curly kale leaves can be used as a garnish for      vegetable platters or mixed salads. And, as a more      substantial food in its own right, the versatile vegetable      can be served uncooked, steamed, stewed, creamed, baked ...      or even stir-fried.    </p>    <p>      The leaves aren't the only edible part of this wonder      plant, either. Young kale flowers can be eaten raw      <em>or</em> cooked for an additional dining treat. And      remember, when you include this <em>Brassica</em> in your      menu, you'll be adding impressive amounts of iron and      vitamins!    </p>    <h3>A WEALTH OF VARIETIES</h3>    <p>      There are many fine varieties of kale to choose from. Dwarf      Blue Scotch (also called Dwarf Blue Curled Vates) is a      beautiful cold-hardy plant with tasty, deep blue gray      leaves. Green Curled Scotch looks similar except that its      gray green color isn't quite as interesting (in my opinion)      ... and the plant is somewhat less cold-hardy than Dwarf      Blue.    </p>    <p>      The taller varieties <em>-</em> including Pentland      Brigg, Siberian, Westland ,Winter and Tall Green Curled      <em>-</em> have a more open growth habit than the      dwarf kale species. These will reach 2 feet or more in      height and form longstemmed, loose rosettes of gray green      leaves. I've found that Pentland Brigg has the best      cold-hardiness, but Westland Winter (whose leaves are also      especially mild and tender) is the most attractive in fact,      it's the only tall variety really recommended for oriental      use. As the nondwarf plants lengthen during the winter,      though, they can become awkward-looking and will sometimes      even fallover.    </p>    <p>      Finally, two European hybrids, Fribor and Arpad Royal      Sluis, could be said to bridge the gap between the tall      kales and the dwarf curly types. They are tall <em>and</em>      curly, erect, dense-growing, and very uniform and the      Fribor variety is available in the U.S. for the first time      this year (see the accompanying list of sources).    </p>    <h3>FLOWER KALE AND FLOWER CABBAGE</h3>        <p>      The leaves of flower kale varieties (which are also edible)      can range shape from plain cabbagelike fronds to frilly      foliage. These ornamentals form tight clusters up to 1 foot      tall and 2 feet wide. The outer leaves range in color from      gray green to blue green, overlaid with creamy white, pink,      purple, or deep rose. The most intense colors be found      toward the center of each plant ... with bright veins      running through the outermost leaves. The colorful kales      are strikwhen set against a somber background of evergreen      bushes and gray walls. And for the four-season garden,      asters, chrysanthemums, leeks, cabbage, and kale make      attractive frost-hardy companions.    </p>    <p>      If you're concerned about having very uniform beds, plant a      double row to disguise the irregularities of size and shape      common to flower kale. Or sow the seed in an inconspicuous      area, and later transplant the best specimens to a      prominent place for fall and/or winter display.    </p>    <p>      The best time to start flowering kale will vary with      regional summer weather conditions. In cool climates,      spring-planted kale will last into the fall. In warmer      areas, however, it may be best to sow the seed in      midsummer... to avoid the plants' bolting, but still allow      them enough time to reach a good size by autumn. Many      flower kale varieties will remain undamaged down to about      20°F ... and as the weather cools, their leaf colors      typically become even more intense.    </p>    <p>      It's fairly easy to find both flower kale and flower      cabbage seeds listed in seed catalogs. In general, you'll      discover that seeds labeled "flower kale" will produce      plants with frilly foliage, while "flower cabbage" seeds      tend to become plants with plainer leaves. It's rare,      though, to find a specific variety of one color and form      offered by American firms (they usually sell mixed seeds),      but Japanese companies often list packets containing a      single variety.    </p>    <p>      Only two of these Oriental types <em>-</em>      Feather-Leaved Coral Queen and Feather-Leaved Coral Prince      <em>-</em> are currently available in the United      States. Both have deeply cut leaves that form broad,      flat-topped rosettes and are fairly uniform in size. Coral      Queen plants are rose purple and blue gray, while Coral      Prince will be white and blue gray. The growth pattern of      these two varieties is a little different from that of      other kales: When they're mass-planted, their response to      crowding is not to stay small, but <em>-</em> instead      <em>-</em> to angle themselves outward to make room      for one another.    </p>    <p>      There are, of course, a great number of varieties other      than those I've described here ... in fact, you may find it      difficult to narrow down your selections. After all, you      could choose kale that lends itself to colorful ornamental      plantings ... or you could simply plant a hardy year-round      food crop. But whether you sow plain or pretty kale      <em>-</em> in your vegetable garden or along a      walkway <em>-</em> the versatile plants will provide      you with beauty <em>and</em> nutrition.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE.
