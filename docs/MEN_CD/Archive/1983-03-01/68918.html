                <p>      <em>Though it's not a glamorous topic, it's time for folks      (since we all need water) to think about</em> <em>...</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>"While we live, our bodies are moving particles of the      earth, joined inextricably both to the soil and to the      bodies of other living things."</em> </p>      <h5 id="byline"><em>by Wendell Barry</em>   </h5>    <p>      Every single time a conventional toilet is flushed, about      40 pounds of potable water is dirtied ... usually in the      process of carrying away <em>less than a pound</em> of      human excrement. Furthermore, each day, the average U.S.      citizen pushes the "out of sight, out of mind" handle seven      times, and in a year, 13,000 gallons of fresh H 2 0 rush      off ... to dispose of enough nitrogen, phosphorus, and      potassium to fertilize a 50' X 50' garden!    </p>        <p>      Of course, there's no question that the modern porcelain      "throne" (and the effective sanitization facilities to      which it's connected) has played a major role in reducing      disease in the twentieth century. But as we approach the      year 2000, the price of sewage treatment as we know it      threatens to become higher than we can afford to pay ... in      terms of both dollars <em>and</em> human health.    </p>    <p>      Today, about 70% of all U.S. households are connected to      centralized waste treatment facilities. And on the average,      those plants represent between $500 and $600 of capital      <em>per individual served.</em> In fact, sewage treatment      is one of the largest public works projects ever undertaken      ... having absorbed more than $35 billion to date, and      estimated to require another $115 billion by the turn of      the century. Worse yet, <em>despite</em> that incredible      outlay, serious questions about the long-term health      effects of the use of the residues left after treatment      have yet to be answered.    </p>    <p>      The remaining 30% of U.S. households are served by personal      disposal facilities ... usually a septic tank and drainage      field. When working correctly, these systems don't result      in direct runoff to streams-nor do they add to      <em>public</em> indebtedness-but they have been      singled out as <em>the</em> largest source of ground-water      contamination (see the article on page 26 for more about      the problems that face our underground water supplies).    </p>    <p>      So when the numerous liabilities of the Thomas Crapper      water closet (yes, that is the name of the man who      developed the flush toilet) are consideredfrom water      consumption to pollution and from outright treatment cost      to the waste of valuable organic matter-there's little      doubt that the commode must change dramatically ... and      soon!    </p>    <p>      The following article describes several approaches that can      be used to reduce water consumption for waste disposal      and-in a few cases-turn that waste into useful      products. While some of these techniques do a more thorough      job of protecting the environment than others, any one of      them would be a significant improvement over the      conventional high-volume toilet.    </p>    <h3>QUICK FIXES</h3>    <p>      As many people know, there's no reason <em>why</em> five      gallons of water must be wasted to flush a conventional      toilet. With bricks (or water-filled plastic bottles)      placed up <em>right</em> at each end inside the tank,      adequate flushing pressure-which is a function of the      level in the reservoir-can be maintained while less water      is consumed. Commercial dams that can be inserted around      the outlet from the tank serve roughly the same purpose.      These simple methods can cut the water used in flushing by      20%.    </p>    <p>      Another worthwhile approach is to tune to each situation      the amount of liquid that's flushed. Two-stage valves can      be manipulated to discharge a much smaller amount of water      when there are only liquids to be disposed of. You'll be      glad to know, too, that <em>none</em> of these "remedies"      requires a cash outlay of more than $ 10 ... a sum that the      water savings provided by such devices should pay back in      short order.    </p>    <h3>LOW-VOLUME FLUSHERS</h3>    <p>      If you're in the market for a new toiletor if you feel so      strongly about the wasteful nature of your present throne      that you're willing <em>to replace</em> it-one option      is to purchase a low-volume conventional water closet.      Almost all bathroom fixture manufacturers are now offering      what they call "water-saving toilets". Be wary, though ...      the best of these products can get by with as little as a      gallon of water per cycle, but many of them still dispatch      as much as three and a half gallons per flush.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, when compared with composting      toilets-which use <em>no</em> water and recycle the      waste-low-volume commodes don't rate high on the      environmental chart ... but using one or two gallons per      flush certainly <em>does</em> compare favorably with      wasting five. (Besides, these conventional-looking      thrones are more likely to meet with approval from building      inspectors and future buyers of your home than are      composters.)    </p>    <h3>AUGMENTED FLUSHERS</h3>    <p>      Water use in liquid-driven disposal systems can be reduced      to less than a gallon per cycle if some other force in      addition to gravity <em>is</em> employed to help drive the      water down. The two most common approach are positive and      negative pressure... wherein the system is either placed in      a partial vacuum or is pushed by compressed a Since such      setups require an auxilia power source (either a vacuum      pump or compressor) to get the job done, thoug they're      comparatively expensive and do require some source of      (usually electric energy. At present, they're most commonly      used in large, multiresidence buildin where the hardware      can be centralized.    </p>    <h3>NONRECYCLING WATERLESS TOILETS</h3>    <p>      In areas that have no central sewage trea ment and severe      soil and ground-water lim tations on septic tanks and      drainage field ... chemical, incineration, oil, and on-site      treatment facilities are the options most often selected.    </p>    <p>      Many people have probably encountere the basic chemical      toilet in the form of po table outhouses ... the units that      usually give off a sweet "chemical" odor. Whateve form they      take, though, such toilets are really nothing more than      sanitary holding tanks, and no processing of the content      takes place within the device.    </p>    <p>      Incineration toilets, on the other had use either gas or      electric heat to turn wast to ash. They yield a sterilized      effluent that's considerably reduced in volume, but do      require a lot of energy.    </p>    <p>      Oil systems carry waste to a central holding tank ... using      a medium that won't mix with the products being disposed      off. The mineral-based oil then floats to the top of the      contents of the holding tank and is picked up and pumped      back to the fixture for reuse. Residential models      <em>will</em> hold year's worth of waste for a family of      four. .. after which the holding tank must pumped out and      the waste trucked off <em>for</em> proper disposal.    </p>    <p>      On-site processing systems (of which the septic tank with      drainage field is one example) don't necessarily save      water, but neither do they burden community sewage      treatment plants. One version relies on aerobic processing,      and resembles a wella-erated septic tank but employs a      different biological process. A system is also available,      on a limited basis, that recycles all of the water used in      a household ... and though it's rather expensive at this      time and requires semiannual maintenance by skilled      technicians, it may become more practical and affordable in      years to come.    </p>    <h3>WATERLESS WASTE RECYCLERS</h3>    <p>      Human waste can be broken down by natural biological      processes that, if properly maintained, render it safe and      useful for fertilization of certain types of plants. The      mechanism by which decomposition takes place is roughly the      same as that which cuts in a garden compost pile, and      consists of bacteria that thrive in an environment well      supplied with air. Both biological action and-to some      extent-the heat generated by it are responsible for      the sterilization of the waste.    </p>    <p>      Very generally, composting waste disposal systems can be      divided into two types: privies (where the waste is removed      periodically for composting in a separate bin) and toilets      (where most of the biological action takes place within the      receiving chamber). In addition, though composting privies      <em>are</em> often located separate from the residential      structure and frequently don't bear much physical      resemblance to the conventional toilet, they are distinct      from the traditional outhouse (in which the little      decomposition that does take place is <em>anaerobic).</em>    </p>    <p>      In use and maintenance, a composting toilet or privy      requires more care than do most of the other alternatives      we've mentioned. For one thing, material that's rich in      carbon (vegetable matter) must be added, with each use, to      balance the nitrogen present in human waste (a 30:1 C-to-N      ratio is ideal for decomposition). The contents may also      have to be stirred occasionally, and-once every year or      so-some totally decomposed matter can be removed.    </p>    <p>      Studies have shown that the residue left by a <em>properly      functioning</em> composter has very few remaining      pathogens. Nonetheless, the potential for disease from      incorrectly processed human waste should not be ignored. To      date, few experts recommend that the humus from a composter      be used to fertilize anything other than      <em>ornamental</em> plants, and it's quite likely that      local health regulations will prohibit <em>any</em>      above-surface disposal. In time, though, the confidence of'      health experts may increase, and the state of technology      and its application may improve enough to allow more      fruitful use of decomposed human waste.    </p>    <p>      Commercial composting toilets are for the most part very      well engineered and backed by caring people. Still, the      prices of such units may exceed many folks' budgets ...      particularly because some sort of system to dispose of gray      water (liquid from sinks, bathtubs, etc.) will have to be      set up,    </p>    <p>      in addition to the commode, to handle <em>that</em> liquid      waste. The accompanying commentaries are from people who've      built their own composting toilets ... often, at least in      part, to avoid the expense of buying a commercial unit.      Zandy Clark is one of the foremost designers of      do-it-yourself composting toilets and privies, and the      model he's presenting takes a unique approach to solving      the all-too-frequent problem of excess liq uid. And Kathy      Dahl, in her report, mentions that difficulty and relates      <em>her</em> solution. We hope you'll profit from      <em>both</em> of these individuals' expertise-through-      experience.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you're seriously considering using or      building an alternative waste disposal system, you'll want      to take advantage of the top-notch written material that's      available. For an overall guide through the wonders of      waste disposal, you'll want to read Goodbye to the Flush      Toilet edited by Carol Hupping Stoner (Rodale Press,      $10.95) and/or The Toilet Papers by Sim Van der Ryn (Capra      Press, $5.95).
