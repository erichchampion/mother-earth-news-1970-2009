                    <p>      <em>As most folks are well aware, an attempt to achieve a      more self-reliant lifestyle often involves a good bit of      problem solving ... and much of the time, there just      doesn't seem to be a ready supply of</em> answers <em>to      the questions that come up. We're pleased to present, then,      the following column ... in which a number of well-known      individuals from various areas of expertise (such as      gardening, alternative building methods, hydroponics, water      toxicity, and wood heating, to name a few) have agreed to      act as "consultants" for you.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If a question concerning some aspect of self-reliant      living has you stumped, send it to Ask Our Experts, THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) 105 Stoney Mountain Road,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791. Please don't expect      personal replies, though. The most frequently asked      questions will be answered here-and here      only-so that we can all benefit from what these folks      have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      My wife and I have both just turned 40, and we're thinking      of starting a homestead in another part of the country      (we're living in California at the present time). We still      owe $3,000 on our house with ten acres, and we don't have      much spare cash ... but now that our children are grown, we      want to relocate to a more rural area and attempt to be as      self-reliant as possible.    </p>    <p>      We'd like to know if the Nearings think we're too old to      <em>start</em> homesteading. We have the desire to go back      to the land, but are hesitant to begin anew at our age.    </p>    <p>      You're far from old! In fact, you're just starting middle      life. Furthermore, we are at the tail end of this round of      our life on earth, and we're still at it! It isn't age that      makes the difference: It's application, stickto- it-      iveness, work, and pluck. (A little luck helps, too!)    </p>    <p>      We've moved twice since our first homesteading venture in      the 1930's, and each time we had to start from scratch on      poor, uncultivated clay. We built up the soil of both those      gardens, making the earth friable and productive for the      next person who might work with it, and then moved on to      new gardening and building endeavors.    </p>    <p>      Right now, in our late 70's and 90's (Scott is actually in      his 100th year!), we're enjoying lettuce, spinach, leeks,      and other hardy greens <em>-</em> during what is, at      the time of this writing, a cold January <em>-</em>      from our sunheated greenhouse, and we're munching on the      fall root crops that are stored in the cellar . . . at a      time when most folks are able to rind freshness only on the      supermarket shelves. What's more, we're already preparing      for our 1983 planting in the 50' X 50' stone-walled garden      that we started two years ago in a soggy marsh.    </p>    <p>      In short, at 40 you still ought to have the <em>best      of</em> your lives ahead. Good luck! <em>-</em>      <em>Helen and Scott Nearing.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Nearings began homesteading, in 1932, on a run-down      farm in Vermont ... and then later moved to the Maine      coast, where you can find them today, still building the      stone structures they're famous for and raising most of      their vegetarian diet.

If possible, I'd      like to install a small propeler driven wind generator to      take advantage of the output air from the ceiling fan. I'd      hope the unit could produce two amps of 12-volt DC      electricity to charge a battery bank.    </p>    <p>      Could you recommend a propeller, generator, and      configuration to maximize the benefit of the fan's exhaust      air?    </p>    <p>      <strong>You can't use the output from an attic fan or a      whole-house ventilating fan . . . for a couple of reasons.      First, the output-while seemingly significantis very      <em>low-power</em> wind. Second, and more important, the      operation of a whole-house unit depends on the unrestricted      flow of air through the building (in the windows and doors,      and up and out the attic vents). Any blades would block the      airflow and set up back-pressure interference.

Having never used a softener before,      I was concerned about the quality of such treated water.      The local health department told me that softening      increases the sodium content of the liquid ... and      <em>-</em> given the emphasis now placed on low-salt      diets <em>-</em> I wondered whether I should have my      drinking supply <em>bypass</em> the softener.    </p>    <p>      Likely yes, but only after you understand the situation      better and have found the answers to some questions      peculiar to your location and circumstance. There is, you      see, no <em>universal</em> answer.    </p>    <p>      Ground water from wells often contains naturally occurring      minerals dissolved in low to medium concentrations.      Depending upon the geology of your area and the depth of      your well, your water may contain fair concentrations of      such dissolved ions as calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese,      and a host of other metals. In some circumstances, the      concentrations of particular ions can be so high that there      are excellent medical reasons either to remove them or to      find an alternative source of drinking water. In most      situations, though, the dissolved minerals impart      properties that folks find make the liquid undesirable only      for certain uses. For example, calcium and magnesium make      water "hard", thereby interfering with the lathering and      cleansing ability of soap . . . while iron and manganese      may give water an objectionable taste, odor, or color.    </p>    <p>      Most water softeners operate by exchanging sodium ions for      other metal ions (this takes place as the water passes      through the tank containing the so-called ion exchange      resins). The water is softened by the removal of the ions      responsible for "hardness" or "off" color and taste, and      the introduction of sodium ions in their place. (Be careful      here, though: There art many other natural and synthetic      substances that may cause taste and/or odor problems, so      don't assume that such irregularities will disappear upon      the installation of a softener.)    </p>    <p>      Although the EPA doesn't publish any restrictions on the      amount of sodium in drinking water, several states do.      Massachusetts, for one, has established a concentration      limit of 20 parts per million (PPM) in public drinking      water supplies, a figure in keeping with recommendations      from the American Heart Association and several experts on      cardiovascular health. The medical community, in general,      suggests that people with certain underlying health      conditions <em>-</em> including hypertension, kidney      ailments, or pregnancy <em>-</em> have good reason to      restrict their intake of dietary sodium . . . and that most      Americans consume more sodium in meals, snacks, and      beverages than is healthful. Given these concerns, many      people now watch their sodium intake from all sources,      <em>including water</em> .    </p>    <p>      Before making a decision about your drinking supply,      however, you need to further analyze your particular      setting. You must rind out the mineral composition of the      well water <em>before</em> it's treated, so you can      determine the nature of your problem <em>and</em> estimate      (perhaps with the help of a local chemist) what the sodium      concentration would be after softening. Then      <em>-</em> if the softened water <em>does</em>      contain, say, more than 20 PPM of sodium <em>-</em>      you need to determine whether you can bypass the softener      without causing a taste and/or odor problem.      <em>-</em> David Burmaster.    </p>    <p>      <em>David Burmaster, Ph.D. is a consultant on surface- and      ground-water quality and hazardous waste management.
