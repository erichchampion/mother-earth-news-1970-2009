                <p>      <strong>REPORTS FROM AMERICA</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>David meets Goliath at city hall.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Andrew Holleman    </h5>        <p>      <em>Andrew Holleman at rest in his "beloved woods," a site      his campaign helped keep from development.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>CHELMSFORD, MA-“Mom, I've got to go to the      library. Can you drive me?”. That was the first thing      I said after I read a registered letter that my parents      got. It concerned the development of land</em> near my home      and stated that a meeting about it would be held at the      town hall.    </p>    <p>      It made me mad. "How could this be happening?" I asked      myself. I knew these woods-I had loved, studied,      explored them; I practically grew up there. Now an $11      million, 180-unit condominium complex was going to be built      on one privately owned parcel (sandwiched between two      pieces of preserved conservation land). That parcel was      almost half wetlands. It contained wood turtles,      blue-spotted salamanders (both declining species rated "of      special concern" by wildlife authorities), great blue      herons, various hawks, lady's slippers, and mountain      laurel.    </p>    <p>      I was angry because this beautiful piece of land and      wildlife habitat was about to be destroyed. Weren't people      aware of their environment after being informed every day      from so many sources that our world is at stake?    </p>    <p>      I also had so many memories based in that area. When I was      very young, I took nature walks there with my family and      even remember having a winter picnic in the snow by a      stream with them. Later, when I was older, I went there      with my friend on our own nature walks or to go ice-skating      on a pond in the woods.    </p>    <p>      Now I go there to sit and think for hours on end. There are      times I just sit and watch the deer, fox, and other      animals. I go fishing sometimes in the ice-skating pond and      have caught a 12-inch bass (this is not a fish story).    </p>    <p>      I guess I was just plain angry that "my land" was going to      be destroyed and that it was one more insult to the      environment. I had to do something.    </p>    <p>      At the library, I looked up the Hatch Act, the      Massachusetts law that protects wetlands. I also read the      town Master Plan. It listed the acreage of the site and      noted which parts were wetland, poor soil, or developable.      There I found the ammunition I needed: Only 2.2 acres of      the 16.3-acre site were considered sound enough to be      developed.    </p>    <p>      After leaving the library, I wrote a petition and took it      to neighbors to get signatures from registered voters and      to tell people about the developer's meeting and the harm      that this complex could do to our woods.    </p>    <p>      Much to my surprise, most people showed a lot of interest      and were happy to sign. I collected about 150 signatures      (only two adults said no) and also started a petition for      students to sign.    </p>    <p>      It wasn't always easy going from door to door. One day,      while crossing my beloved wetlands to reach another part of      the neighborhood, I slipped on a rotted log and sent myself      and the petition flying into a small, muddy stream. It took      a while for the petition to dry and for my mother to iron      out the papers. That was the last time I went through the      swamp with anything important that wasn't waterproofed.    </p>    <p>      When the night came for the meeting, my parents and I were      directed to a room that could hold about 50 people (the      developer had sent his original notification to the 50      families whose homes abutted the property). Within 20      minutes we were moved to a larger room in the town hall      because it was obvious that many more people would show up.      Finally, it became apparent that we needed a larger room      still.    </p>    <p>      A half hour later, more than 250 people had gathered in the      hall's basement gymnasium, ready to hear about the proposed      project and its impact on our community. A number of times      during the meeting, the developer took credit for inviting      the people there to hear about his proposal. The crowd,      just as often, reminded him that I was the one who had      actually invited most of them.    </p>    <p>      After the developer discussed his project plans, I made my      speech. You can't have stage fright at a moment like      this-you have to just get up and tell your side of      the story. Holding the shell of a wood turtle I'd found in      the woods, I spoke about how this development would destroy      the animal and plant life. I told how the stream on the      land would eventually become polluted and carry its      pollution into nearby town wells. I also suggested another      site the developer might use, one that would better      withstand the environmental impact. (Interestingly enough,      the developer has already started constructing a      condominium on the alternative site that I had originally      suggested. It was the old drive-in movie lot here in town.)    </p>    <p>      After that night, I wrote letters to many state      representatives and senators and also to a local TV      anchorwoman, hoping to gain more support. I included my      petition in the letters. I then telephoned the      Massachusetts Audubon Society "Helpline" and spoke with Dr.      Dorothy Arvidson, a biologist and now a good friend.    </p>    <p>      She told me to keep my fight local, that I should approach      the town representatives because national and state      organizations wouldn't be much help. She was telling me      other things to do when I interrupted to say I was only 12      years old. "Well, that's no excuse," she said, and went on      giving me information.    </p>    <p>      From that point on, meetings were held every week for seven      months so the developer could present his proposal to      conservation commissions, appeal boards, and      selectmen-just to name a few. These meetings often      took place on school nights and sometimes lasted up to      three and a half hours. Somehow I managed to attend every      one and still get good grades.    </p>    <p>      Later we formed a neighborhood association to keep people      up-to-date and to raise money for a lawyer and an      environmental scientist. My dad and I became members of the      Concord Road Neighborhood Association. The public supported      us, donating nearly $16,000<br />      to stop the condominium project.    </p>    <p>      I was told that "you can't fight city hall" and that the      developer was a "townie" who always got his way. But my      feeling is you shouldn't get discouraged if you hear      statements like that. If you believe in something, you have      to stand up for it. Don't ever give up the fight against a      poorly sited development, pollution, or anything      environmentally dangerous. If you do, you are giving up on      the world. Even if you don't win, at least you will have      tried.    </p>    <p>      After nine months and much hard work, the developer, the      neighborhood association, the state Department of      Environmental Quality Engineering, and others showed up to      give the site a deep-hole test to find out if it was      suitable for building. The test checks the soil's drainage      by seeing if a deeply dug hole will fill with water. I was      fairly confident that the site would fail, because I had      known that land a long time. But I can tell you that when      the test confirmed my beliefs, I was excited and relieved.      (Even if the site had passed the test, I would have kept      fighting anyway.)    </p>    <p>      The town of Chelmsford then officially "denied      comprehensive permit," a legal step that insured the      development would not be built and that nothing of the same      magnitude could ever be constructed there. So the land is      safe-for the time being. I'm now trying to get      funding from the state to buy the site outright to protect      it.    </p>    <p>      To all of the people who read this article, I challenge you      to come to the defense of the environment. It is not just      the destruction of the rain forests, the acid rain, and the      ozone layer that should concern us, but also our own      communities. We can work to stop building developments that      are hazardous to life and land. We can recycle plastics,      glass, and paper. We can save water and use far less energy      than we do.    </p>    <p>      It is not all that hard to help in the fight to save our      planet. Earth. If we are all a little more caring and      careful, we will be much closer to saving our environment      for ourselves and for future generations.    </p>
