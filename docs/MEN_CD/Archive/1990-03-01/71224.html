                <p>      <strong>CLOTHES THAT WORK</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>The leopard has his spots; we have clothes.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Jan Adkins    </h5>        <p>      <strong><em>Even in Feudal Japan, the art of keeping dry in      a cold, chill rain called for a variety of      materials.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>When the elements question our right to prowl outside      our caves, -when even the leopard is crouched in a burrow      to keep dry, then our outer skins must become more than      finery. Clothes must work.</em>    </p>    <p>      I am looking at a color print by the 18th-century Japanese      master Ando Hiroshige, <em>The Great Ohashi Bridge Under      the Pouring Rain</em> . In a driving, cold rain a half      dozen citizens hurry across the exposed arch of the bridge.      Two women ward off the rain with broad traveling hats,      though I can see that their bright silk kimonos will be      soaked, and they may be furious enough to beat their      servants when they get home. One man stumps along under an      old tatami mat, a good idea, but he will have to be fairly      athletic if the wind (which is calm) picks up. A trio of      workmen have taken off their trousers and are walking in      bare feet under a large ribbed umbrella; they will have a      chilly but convivial walk and nothing will be ruined. One      barelegged man seems to be struggling with the thick cotton      of his smock, wet beyond the brim of his conical straw hat.      Coming downstream and soon to pass under the bridge is a      waterman poling a narrow lumber raft. He is also wearing a      conical straw hat and a woven-grass ram stole that makes      him look like a long-legged hedgehog.    </p>    <p>      These men and women from feudal Japan illustrate several of      the difficulties of keeping dry when the air around you      isn't.    </p>    <p>      The highborn ladies are discovering that the fabrics that      drape well and comfortably in a garment are, by their      nature, absorbent. As the moisture wets them to their      highborn skin, they will also find that water efficiently      conducts heat away from the body and chills them. There      were only a few materials available in 18th-century Japan      or Europe that were waterproof and flexible enough to wear.      Linen was sometimes impregnated with beeswax to make a      waterproof cloak, and coats like these are made today by      Barbour in the United Kingdom. They have the expensive      appeal and clunky lines of a Range Rover, but they are not      terribly durable or versatile, and I wouldn't hang one next      to your white silk kimono in the closet.    </p>    <p>      The chap under the tatami mat has a thick shield between      him and the downpour. It should work, for a while, and he      has his own little tent under it. One of the most effective      pieces of rain gear is the poncho, a flat sheet of coated      fabric that folds over the shoulders, has a pop-up hood in      the middle, and lots of room inside. Because the tatami and      the poncho are impromptu kites when the wind blows,      practical hands slimmed the poncho profile and made a      cagoule, a large hooded bag with sleeves that slips over      the head and comes down below the knees. The poncho and      this walking tent have advantages. There is enough room      inside them to promote circulation.    </p>    <p>      The three mates under the umbrella are moving right along,      trying to get under cover. They are discovering the hardest      thing about staying dry while making any effort in the      rain: Even in this chilly scene they will begin to sweat.      When rubber found its way from the jungles, we had a      perfectly waterproof covering. The rain gear that      professional fishermen use today is often the stiff, almost      bulletproof Black Diamond gear or Helly J. Hansen's robust      rubber-and-polyurethane bib sets. Unfortunately, shutting      out the elements doesn't keep anyone dry. A human body      performing light to strenuous exercise regulates the      critical temperature of its cells by throwing off one to      two pounds of water vapor each hour sweating. The vapor      passes from the skin and through porous, absorbent      clothing. As it moves away from the body it loses heat      (which is what it's supposed to be doing). At some point it      will reach its dew point and condense, either on the inside      surface of the cooled rubber or somewhere in the clothing.      The inhabitant of this two-way water barrier will be soaked      in a short time. Then the water will carry heat away from      the body even more efficiently through the damp clothing,      and chill will set in.    </p>    <p>      I wish there were someone who looked comfortable on the      bridge, because staying dry begins to look hopeless. The      fact is, keeping dry was not asked of clothing until the      last few decades. We have an exaggerated expectation of      comfort. As an example, oilskins (canvas soaked in a      polymerizing oil) worked as well as any sailor expected      them to work. He knew that they leaked at the seams, soaked      him with his own sweat inside, and made him smell like the      back room of a taxidermy shop, but he was only concerned      with staying warm. He trusted wool serge pants and wool      sweaters to insulate him even when they were damp. And,      come to that, he didn't mind the cold as much as you do.    </p>         <p>      <strong>Rain can be an intimate companion. But its      fascinations are easily washed out by cold and      damp.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>The REI Switchback Parka and side-zip parts are sturdy,      waterproof, lightweight, and not too dear.</em>    </p>    <p>      THE best example of weather-proofing by weight is the      trench coat. What a piece of work the real article is! Six      hundred buttons, a foundry output of metal rings and      buckles, epaulets, room enough to rent space. The collar      buttons up to the nose, the wrists adjust, the pockets are      deep, the waist cinches flatteringly, and there's a      shoulder patch for your Enfield rifle. Trench coats are      built in a tightly woven wool twill that sheds water for      hours. Designed to keep men in some kind of comfort while      they marched or stood in trenches, the coat is heavy and      cumbersome-and once the shedding hours are up, it      lets you know.    </p>    <p>      Technology began to tinker with the possibilities of a      "breathing" coat in the early '60s. The familiar sierra      coat was made of a fabric blend of 60% cotton for      breathability and can-vaslike repellency and 40% nylon for      strength. The theory sounded good: The coat would breathe      while water beaded on the surface until the outer fibers      absorbed moisture and swelled, held in place by the      stronger, less permeable nylon. Water would be excluded,      but water vapor would pass through. In reality this coat      kept its inmate dry for about five minutes in a light mist,      but it was so damned useful and handsome that it's become a      classic light coat for cool, sunny days.    </p>    <p>      The W.L. Gore company does not manufacture rain gear,      shoes, or gloves. They have perfected a film, thinner than      a communion wafer, that has interesting properties. It is      made of a synthetic polymer that is hydrophobic (it will      not hold water, or "hates" it) and has a controlled      porosity. In every square inch of the film there are 9      billion open pores of fairly consistent size. As a gas,      water's molecular structure is small and passes through the      pores. In liquid form, water's matrix is too large to pass      through and is kept on the outside. Another oleophobic      layer is added that will not allow body oils to compromise      the film's mechanism. The film is too delicate for use on      its own and so borrows strength from the hard-wear textiles      to which it is bonded. Bonded, seams taped, tested and      approved for water repellency by the W.L. Gore labs, it      becomes Gore-Tex for a limited number of licensed      manufacturers.    </p>         <p>      <em>If you find yourself in rough weather, these Patagonia      Storm Anoraks and Pants will keep your calm.</em>    </p>    <p>      Gore-Tex works, but it is not the end of woe. The film      simply can't deal with all of the body's output during      exercise; some water vapor will condense if it isn't      allowed to escape. In extreme situations the outer fabric's      water-beading repellency breaks down and (sometimes      abruptly) conducts heat away from the inner environment      more efficiently; the temperature gradient below the      Gore-Tex film changes and the dew point location moves      deeper into the absorbent layers of clothing. Clothing is      soaked with moisture. A clammy cold invades, which may be      an occasion for some muttered Anglo-Saxon words in      fortunate circumstances, and for genuine danger in critical      times.    </p>    <p>      Staying optimistic in the rain is an old problem, older      than the bridge at Ohashi, but some extraordinary companies      are working on it for you. One of the best is Moonstone      Mountaineering. Their Advantage Jacket ($295) has a durable      outer fabric bonded to a Gore-Tex film. Beneath that      laminate it is fully lined to "breathe" better. It has a      detachable hood, a drawstring waist, and "pit zips" with      double flaps that mechanically vent the hot spot under the      arms.    </p>    <p>      The North Face's Triplex Jacket ($235) protects the      high-abrasion, high-rain-strike areas with layers of fabric      backed by Gore-Tex and a lining. Its cuffs are adjustable,      and its zipper has a snap flap. It is only one of the      products that have come out of their ambitious research and      testing. The Triplex demonstrates one of the basic wet      survival techniques: color. Buy rain gear bright enough to      embarrass you just a little in the showroom. In the gray      light of a cloudy day, bright colors glow like a uranium      stockpile.    </p>    <p>      Patagonia is also one of the largest and most thorough      explorers of outdoor clothing. The Storm Jacket and Storm      Anorak ($220, $235) are beautifully made and constructed      with Patagonia's proprietary vapor-permeable treatment,      H2No. They are lined with nylon mesh and nylon ripstop, and      have adjustable cuffs and a drawstring waist. Patagonia      works in three repellent grades: H 2 Ho Light, very      breathable, suitable for heavy activity in light mist or      drizzle; H 2 Ho Plus, a middle range for wet snow or rain;      H 2 Ho Storm for cataclysmic downpours and Seattle.    </p>    <p>      Marmot Mountain International's Monsoon ($239) is a      reinforced rain jacket with a Gore-Tex laminate and      ripstop/mesh nylon lining. It has a strength of detail and      durability gained from Marmot's background in making      mountain equipment.    </p>    <p>      REI, Recreational Equipment, Incorporated, is one of the      largest manufacturers of outdoor clothing. Their Switchback      Parka ($185) has a Gore-Tex laminate and is half-lined with      mesh. It is a sturdy piece of equipment and, as the least      expensive rain jacket here, points out that comfort doesn't      come cheaply.    </p>    <p>      Because a good raincoat is a serious investment, you should      be serious about choosing it. Be certain that it is      crossover gear-that it is useful in several ways, for      several sports or times. It is not too much to ask of these      jackets that they keep you well while you are sailing,      hiking, skiing, or going to the comer for some oat bran.      But also be certain that you do not expect magic. No      foul-weather gear without a power supply (NASA is good at      these) can keep you dry by itself; you must help. For the      best vapor dumping in a cold rain, you should have a      hydrophobic layer (like capi-lene underwear) next to the      skin, an absorbent layer beyond (a cotton flannel shirt      would do), and an insulating layer between you and the      outer skin (wool or synthetic pile). Keep your rain gear      clean and oil-free; pay attention to the garment care tags      the manufacturer takes the trouble to put on them. Also,      zipper failure is all too common, usually the result of      grit in the teeth. So blow the zipper slider clean once in      a while.    </p>    <p>      It is still raining on the bridge in Ohashi. The most      serene member of the scene seems to be the waterman, poling      his raft. He may be humming under his hat. Water vapor goes      though his cotton smock and into the grass rain stole      easily. His legs are bare. The bridge pilings, still a gray      pattern to him, are not a difficult passage. I believe I      would like to put on my Moonstone jacket and my Black      Diamond pants and join him.    </p>
