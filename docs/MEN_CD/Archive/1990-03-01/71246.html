                    <p>      <em>To get intimate with a deeper calendar, take off your      watch and go out in the garden.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by SUSAN SIDES    </h5>    <p>      <strong>PART TWO</strong>    </p>    <p>MUD season, the harvest moon, or when the      frost is on the pumpkin. We're all familiar with such time      measurements: the kind far removed from calculated      accuracy. Not the precise (and aloof) paper calendar, but      an earthy one with cycles of life, death, and change.      Flexible but constant. Spring always comes, and it always      comes after winter. It just retains the privilege of      choosing which day it arrives.    </p>    <p>      Gardeners know this. Sweat and ripe sweet corn are      increments of summer. The bowed brown heads of sunflower      feeders gauge the progression of fall. Still, our garden      calendars are only privately useful, not universally      synchronized. March 15 is March 15 everywhere. Such exact      standards facilitate human interaction. But when I write my      friend in Wisconsin to say how good it felt to dig a bed      and get the peas in, I know I'll strike a chord of envy as      she walks back from the mailbox in snow boots and woolen      scarf. She can relate. Oh, how she can relate. It's just      not her turn to flip the page to spring quite yet.    </p>    <p>      I thought I'd show you some of the pages in my own seasonal      timepiece, even if it is like cornering you with photos of      the kids:    </p>    <p>IT'S WINTER WHEN: the mailbox has a      mouthful of seed catalogs day after day, its jaws so full      the mailman just leaves the flap hanging down like a huge      silver tongue ... no one bothers to shut the garden gate      against dogs, goats, pigs, and ten-year-olds on bicycles .      . . boots sit by the fire to keep them supple . . . the      toolshed (a converted outhouse) blows over in a good north      wind ... I can't see my toes. Well, women gardeners have to      time these things, you know. (Not tonight, honey: Nine      months from now I'll be in a double-digging frenzy.) We      have winter babies. That way, between putting in the fall      garlic and the spring peas, we can start real labor.    </p>    <p>      IT'S SPRING WHEN:last year's tennis shoes      look like blown-out retreads . . . muddy boots stand on the      porch like armatures half covered in clay . . . the wooden      tool handles are still slick from their winter coat of oil      ... a few toys begin sprouting in the nearby sandbox . . .      requests for seed-starting advice make the phone jingle      every day . . . the post office calls at 6:30 A.M. to tell      us the little peepers have arrived for our yearly chicken      moat, the one that borders our plot in hopes of reducing      insects, supplying meat, and keeping weeds back . . . it's      hard to dig a bed, what with having to wave to all the      neighbors driving by. As long as the branches on our      treelined border remain bare, we're honked at from dawn to      dusk. This season for hat-in-the-air salutations runs from      October to nearly May, when those tardy walnuts (the      predominant species) finally leaf out. Sometimes when we're      not outside, the scarecrow takes up the slack and, its arms      flapping in the wind, seems to wave for us.    </p>    <p>       IT'S SUMMER WHEN: abandoned boots and      shoes lie strewn in the paths for days . . . cukes arrive      in choking abundance from a retired couple who have "scaled      down" their enthusiasm to a 50-foot row ... I can see my      toes once again-except in the shower where the water      that runs off my body looks like chocolate syrup . . . toys      and children have come into full bloom both in the sandbox      and the garden proper . . . the slick of the tool handles      comes not from oil, but from human use ... a blind friend      feels the increase in textural relief on my hands and makes      a game of guessing just which chore was the most pressing      last week.    </p>    <p>      IT'S FALL (OR NEARLY SO) WHEN: the sight      of the farm silage wagons and the sound of the chopper      become a daily event . . . there's less need to start the      irrigation pump-a chore that elicits much energy,      colorful language, and very little water when I attempt it      on my own . . . there's more need to start the tiller for      cover-cropping the field areas-a spectator's sport I      greatly enjoy. My husband cranks, adjusts, cranks, checks      gas, cranks, and readjusts till his patience is exhausted.      He places hands on hips, then slaps his head in      remembrance. Reaching into the depths of the device, he      pulls out a mouse nest (the third one this week) and curses      me under his breath for never having the heart to kill any      of the blind and hairless baby mice I find.    </p>    <p>      Well, that's a small glimpse of seasons in the Sides      garden. Surprisingly, I've even found it possible to hone      in on what day of the week it is by the community activity      around the place. (Kids line up at the landlord's for piano      lessons on Tuesdays, the farm truck carries cattle to      market on Thursdays, etc.)    </p>    <p>      Come to think of it, even the time of day is palpable: When      frantic barking down the road signals morning feeding time      at the local kennel, it's nearly 8:00 ... a sudden air of      quiet as the compressor at the dairy barn two miles away      cuts off (give or take a few minutes depending on how many      they're milking this week), and it's 9:00-almost time      to check the mail and break for a snack ... I head in for      my 12:30 meal when the sight of lunchtime joggers seconds      the growling suspicion in my stomach . . . escapees racing      down the driveway, just released from the maw of the yellow      and black school bus, signal 3:30. Any moment now my son      should be waking from his nap. Soon he and Dad will join      me.    </p>    <p>      Whether you inherited it as an heirloom from your      grandparents or took possession only last week, a garden is      an amazing, living, breathing timepiece. You can forget the      second hand, though. Gardens just weren't meant to have      one.    </p>
