                       <h3> MOTHER HAS HER LAND!</h3>       <p>      Yep! After nearly seven years of <em>talking</em> about it,      MOTHER finally has a piece of land that's big enough and      diverse enough to do her Research Center/Eco-Village      concept proud.    </p>    <p>      What it is is 622.4 acres of beautiful mountains and      valleys and streams and lakes and woods and open clearings      located just about 10 minutes' drive from MOTHER's      Hendersonville, North Carolina offices. The property      contains lots of lovely nooks and crannies for:      underground, passively solar-heated homes . . . research      labs . . . solar and water and wind and other alternative      energy experiments . . . wholistic gardens and greenhouses      . . . wild food seminars . . . and all the many other      activities that MOTHER intends to conduct in her      environmentally planned community.    </p>    <p>      And-NO!-the property will not be open to the      public this summer, fall, or winter. But, <em>starting next      spring</em> , we do expect to be set up to receive visitors      and start holding MOTHER's first seminar and work/study      programs on her nearly one full square mile of land.    </p>    <p>      If all goes well, we'll have some photographs of the      property to show you in the very next issue of this      magazine.    </p>   <h3> SPEAKING OF SEMINARS</h3>    <p>      One of the talented new people who've recently joined      MOTHER's staff is a fellow by the name of John Doyle. And      John, as it just so happens, has <em>only</em> written      somewhat more than 150 home study courses for the biggest      companies in the home study field.    </p>    <p>      Which is exactly why MOTHER has John the Doyle traveling      the <em>country right at this moment</em> . . . putting      together a definitive course of instructions for a seminar      and work/study program on underground housing. Yep! That's      probably going to be the subject of the very first seminar      and work/study program that MOTHER holds next spring . . .      and, so far at least, it appears that MOTHER's course is      only going to be the best thing that anyone anywhere has      ever done on the design, construction, financing, passive      solar heating, etc., of low-cost, do-it-yourself      underground dwellings.    </p>    <p>      And that's just the <em>first</em> of the many programs      MOTHER has planned for the future. Stay tuned for more      exciting news about MOTHER's seminars!    </p>   <h3> MOTHER'S RADIO SERIES IS HERE!</h3>    <p>      Along about here in MOTHER's last issue, we mentioned that      we would soon be mailing a big promotional      package/announcement about MOTHER's new series of 65      three-minute radio programs out to the program directors of      all the AM and FM stations in the United States.    </p>    <p>      Well, we've done it. And favorable response is already      starting to pour in. But we still need your help to really      put MOTHER's good words about wholistic gardening, low-cost      housing, alternative energy, home businesses, and all the      rest of her great subjects back on the air.    </p>    <p>      CALL THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF YOUR FAVORITE AM OR FM      STATION. NOW! Tell him or her how much you like the      magazine and just how much you'd love to hear THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS" regularly on his or her station. Point out the      fact that the program costs the station absolutely nothing      . . . and that the station has full rights to sell      commercials which air before, in the middle of, and after      MOTHER's three-minute public service message. Emphasize      that the first installment of the series (released seven      years ago) was good enough to play on almost 300 stations      around the country . . . and that this new package of 65      programs (Remember: they're free to any legitimate radio      station!) is even better. And stress that another 65      programs is already in the works and 65 more after that and      so on . . . because, this time when MOTHER goes on the air,      she's going on to stay.    </p>    <p>      That's all you've got to do . . . but do it! We wanna make      sure MOTHER's messages play in your area, so that you can      hear 'em too!    </p>   <h3>AND THERE'S MORE!</h3>    <p>      That's just the beginning of all the new projects which      MOTHER now has underway . . . and which, for the most part,      will be announced more fully as time goes on. For now,      though, it's enough to say that there are a whole lot of      new people, new concepts, new ideas, and new vitality      bustin' at your of MOTHER's seams. As a result, you can      expect better and more lively issues of THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS (restricted) in the future . . . and a whole lotta things      that you can't even imagine yet. So if your subscription      isn't paid up for the next two or three years, you'd be      smart to get your renewal in the mail right now. 'Cause you      ain't gonna want to miss a single one of MOTHER's next      dozen or 18 exciting issues!    </p>
