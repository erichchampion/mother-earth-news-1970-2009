                        <hr />    <p>      <em>It's not so much that all the fools aren't dead. The      discouraging thing is that lots of them aren't even born      yet.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"We can lick gravity . . . but sometimes the paperwork      is overwhelming. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Wernher van Braun</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"I remember the old Vermont farmer who was asked if he      believed in infant baptism. `Believe in it.hell,' he      replied. 'I've seen it with any own eyes. ' "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>U. S. Attorney General Griffin      Bell</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Remember that the night has a thousand eyes . . . but      then, so does a 600-pound potato.</em>    </p>    <p>      They's a certain kind of strange reader out there in MOTHER      land (perhaps you're one of 'em) that always likes to have      at The Last Laugh in every issue of this magazine. Well,      sir . . . that's why we put the feature inta each new      MOTHER. Sick-joke comedians and situation comedies on TV is      all right, I reckon Offen you can stomach 'em) . . . but      for real humor, you jest can't beat the natural antics and      time-tested stories that you'll still find makin' the      rounds in places like the Plumtree Crossin' General Store      (where, as you know, this column usually makes its home).    </p>    <p>      But this ain't the only place you can still see that kind      of laughter and merrymaking reproduced in print. No sir. I      can think of two other rich sources of the same kind of      drollery without even thinkin'    </p>    <p>      First off, there's Cap'n Pere Sane . . . who holds forth      monthly on the editorial page of National Fisherman (21 Elm      Street, Camden, Maine 04843 . . . $8.00 a year . . . and      worth more even if you ain't in the commercial fishin'      trade). It seems that of Pere lives somewhere called      "Saturday Cove, Maine" jest down the wharf from a motley      lot of characters with names like Bubba Beal, Shorty Gage,      Slats Farnum, Pud Hall, Sam Wheeler, and Beulah Banning.      And the column Cap'n Sane wrote last July 'bout the annual      Saturday Cove summer picnic probably gives you as much      insight into the crew's way of thinkin' and doin' as you'll      care to handle at one time.    </p>    <p>      Pere starts right off braggin' about the event's turnout:      "We had four boat loads goin' over t'Flat Island n'three      comin' back. That's a little better than most years,      'specially the comin' back loads."    </p>    <p>      Beulah Banning was there, a'course . . . along with her      cousin Thurzie (who had married a French Canadian and who      was invited along just to add a little decorum to the whole      affair). "Thurzie n'Beul made up a washtub of potato salad      with French dressin'," the good cap'n solemnly reported.      "They also strung up a sack of French Fries n'French      vanilla cookies. N'Thurzie brought along her French poodle      . . . which took care of all the French class we could      handle."    </p>    <p>      Pere further noted that the Dodge girls fetched along 12      Mason jars fulla beet wine, Sam Wheeler (who must be kinda      tight with a dollar) "surprised everybody n'brung salt      n'pepper", and that Slats Farnum "brung three slabs of dry      salt cod which went pretty damn good with the Dodges' beet      wine".    </p>    <p>      There was a little delay gettin' the party together, it      seems, but Shorty Gage and Slats Farnum filled in the time      by killin' two six-packs. Which probably wasn't the best      idea in the world since they led the flotilla out to the      Cove's picnic site later "so's we landed on the weather end      of the island rather than the lee side". And once ashore      ("twenty damn trips in Short's leaky peapod" ), the Dodge      girls "went rose hippin' with gunny sacks while all others      pitched in with the firewood gatherin'. Thurzie's poodle      went yippin' off down the shore n'damned near got his ears      taken off by a fish hawk".    </p>    <p>      After that, someone went about lightin' up a good blaze and      all hands pitched in to put clams, ear corn, and other      edibles t'steamin' in seaweed. And then it was time for the      games. "The underwater walk was canceled," Cap'n Sane      wrote, " 'cause of last year's near tragedy when Shorty ran      outa' air n'his rock ballast got hung up in his belt. Slats      grappled him off bottom just about in time."    </p>    <p>      The crew did have a hot rock juggle, though. "We just toss      'round a hot rock outa' the fire n'the first one who drops      it is a skunk. Shorty was double skunked . . . not 'cause      the rock was so hot, he just couldn't see."    </p>    <p>      Pere also noted that "Pud Hall won the flat rock skippin'      with 34 rings. Slats wanted t'skip Thurzie's poodle but      couldn't catch him. He run off down the other side of the      island from the fish hawk n'found one of the Dodge girls'      jars of beet wine." Accordin' to the Cap'n, the dog "came      back in 'bout an hour, the drunkest poodle you ever saw . .      . n'the rest of the afternoon, him n'Shorty were      inseparable, drinkin' n'carrin' on."    </p>    <p>      The festive afternoon, it appears, was more or less closed      out eventually by the singin' of hymns ("led by Thurzie      n'her drunken poodle"). Cap'n Sane seems to think it was      noteworthy that "we didn't hear any shots fired from the      mainland" during the caterwaul.    </p>    <p>      "We all mustered up Vroll call just as the moon was      rising," Pere reports. "On the fourth call we had      two-thirds present n'called it close enough." No further      mention is made of the missing members of the Cove's picnic      party . . . but as the rest of the group disembarked back      on the mainland and "trooped up the Cove road t'home" all      the hands who were still accounted for started singin' The      Battle Hymn of the Republic. And everyone joined in, "even      Shorty, who was bringin' up the rear carryin' Thu rzie's      passed-out French poodle under one arm".    </p>    <p>      At that, though, the outin' seemed to go off a lot quieter      than it could have. Because, accordin' to Pere's June      report in National Fisherman, it had only been a few days      before, that Beulah (who happens to be the Cove's harbor      master) had stood up at a meetin' and declared to one and      all that Shorty Gage was a direct menace to the Cove's      navigation. She then proceeded to read off a list of his      watery indiscretions . . . endin' with the fact that his      fish house had come "in and out with the tide f'two years      until Sam Wheeler blew it up with 10 sticks of dynamite".    </p>    <p>      Whereupon Short got the crowd's attention by observin' that      "anyone who wore size 13 sneakers, sideways, shouldn't be      preaching on virtues". Which jest naturally inspired Beul      to "let fly a lobster buoy which hit Pud Hall who was      rollin' a Bull Durham n'want [wasn't) lookin' ".    </p>    <p>      The point bein' that the Saturday Cove crowd-jest like the      liars who hang around the Plumtree Crossin' General Store      -are an entertainin' bunch . . . no matter which month it      is that you happen to be readin' about them. And I'll tell      you about that other source of printed downhome tomfoolery      in MOTHER's next issue.    </p>    <p>      <em>It's what we value-not what we have-that makes us</em>      <em>rich.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Dr. J. Harold Smith</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>There are many paths to the top of the mountain, but      the view is always the same.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Chinese Proverb</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Repay evil with good and you deprive the evildoer of      all the pleasures of his wickedness.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Leo Tolstoy</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Every step forward is made at the cost of mental and      physical pain to someone.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Friedrich NietzscheÂ·</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Only a mediocre person is always at his best.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>W.
