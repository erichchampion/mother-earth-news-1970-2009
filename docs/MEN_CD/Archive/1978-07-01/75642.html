             						<hr />			<p>      <strong>THE PUSH TO DEVELOP "BROWN GOLD" (PEAT) IS      ON.</strong> Minnesota Gas Company and the Institute of Gas      Technology have spent $1.5 million studying peat      gasification and intend to build a $5 million pilot plant      in the near future. Meanwhile, there's talk of a growing      "peat lobby" in Washington, and Department of Energy      officials are preparing a "peat position paper". One reason      for all the excitement: Known peat reserves in the U.S,      contain the equivalent of 1,443 quadrillion Btu's of      energy. (Present energy consumption in the U.S.-for all      purposes-is about 75 "quads" a year.)<br />      <br />      <strong>THE WORLD'S LARGEST GEOTHERMAL PLANT</strong>      -Pacific Gas and Electric Company's Unit No. 13-is now      under construction in Lake County, California. When it goes      "on line" in October 1979, the $29 million installation      will supply 135 megawatts of electricity to PG&E's      customers. PG&E presently obtains about 7% of its total      generating capacity from geothermal steam and employs 640      persons in geothermal development. Says one company      representative: "We intend to continue building geothermal      power plants at the rate of one per year as long as there      is a proven supply of steam and a need for electrical      energy."<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>GOT A SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM      THAT DOESN'T PERFORM AS PROMISED?</strong> You might want      to take your complaints) to Southwest Energy Management,      Inc., a two-year-old solar firm that specializes in      <strong>correcting the mistakes of other      installers.</strong> SEM's purpose-according to President      Geoff Smith-is to "fight the fast-buck artist every way we      can, including trying to repair their mistakes and [thus)      restore a degree of faith in the solar energy industry".      Write to Southwest Energy Management, Inc., Dept. TMEN,      8290 Vickers St., Suite B, San Diego, Calif. 92111.<br />      <br />      <strong>BETWEEN 1918 AND 1976, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENT      $134 BILLION ON INCENTIVES</strong> to stimulate energy      production, a study by Batelle Pacific Northwest      Laboratories indicates. Of the total, 5°'o went for      coal production, 10°10 for hydro power, 12°70 for      gas, 13°10 for nuclear . . . and 60% for oil.<br />      <br />      <strong>NUCLEAR WASTE FIRM FAILS TO GET DISPOSAL      SITE.</strong> Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. (Bellevue,      Washington)which handles 70°10 of the low-level      radioactive wastes generated by the nuclear industry in the      U.S.--has decided to give up on trying to win state      approval for a nuclear garbage burial site near Cimarron,      New Mexico. Chem-Nuclear had already spent $620,000 (and      two years) trying to obtain a disposal license. To continue      the push for a license-in the words of company president      Bruce W. Johnson-"would not be a prudent use of      stockholders' money".<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE THE      LAST BIG BLACKOUT IN NEW YORK CITY</strong> . . . and      Consolidated Edison is still backlogged with      blackout-related legal battles. Nearly 100 small claims      have been filed against the utility (for damages ranging      from spoiled food to property destruction) so far. Also      pending are 13 Civil Court suits seeking $58,000 . . . 23      Supreme Court suits seeking $19 million . . . and three      class-action suits that could cost Con Ed $ 10      billion.<br />      <br />      <strong>OIL GIANTS VIE FOR SOLAR MARKET</strong> .      According to a report issued by International Resource      Development, Inc. (125 Elm St., New Canaan, Conn. 06840),      Exxon Corporation intends to market a line of solar heating      systems and heat pumps (for industrial AND residential      applications) within the next five years. Not to be      outdone, Atlantic Richfield Company has acquired the assets      of Solar Technology International, a Chatsworth, California      producer of photovoltaic cells. Solar Tech's new name will      be (appropriately enough) Arco Solar, Inc.<br />      <br />      <strong>ATOMIC POWER PLANTS: LOW-YIELD "NEUTRON      BOMBS"?</strong> An internal memo from the Nuclear      Regulatory Commission warns that nuclear plant workers are      being exposed to bombardment by stray neutrons. So says      columnist Jack Anderson, who points out that-in this      regard-atomic generating stations are very much like      low-yield neutron bombs. (The recently developed neutron      bomb-you'll recall-kills or injures human beings while      leaving buildings more-or-less intact.) The NRC is      reportedly embarking on a one-year, $100,000 study of the      situation.<br />      <br />      <strong>NO MORE FREE LIGHT BULBS:</strong> Detroit Edison      Company-the last utility in the country to give away light      bulbs to its customers-has said it is discontinuing its      free-bulbs program indefinitely . . . . A recent study      prepared by the Departments of Energy and Housing/Urban      Development-HOME MORTGAGE LENDING AND SOLA R , ENERGY- is      available free for the asking by phoning the toll-free      solar hotline: 1-800-523-2929 . . . . <strong>THE STATE OF      OREGON HAS OUTLAWED ELECTRIC MASTER-METERING</strong> OF      NEW APARTMENT BUILDINGS in an effort to save energy.      Master-metered tenants use up to 35% more energy than      tenants who receive individual monthly electric bills . . .      . A recent Harris poll discloses the reassuring fact that      <strong>ONLY 47% OF AMERICANS</strong> NOW FAVOR A SPEEDUP      IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT CONSTRUCTION (versus 69% one year      ago) . . . . The 200-kw DOE/NASA wind generator in Clayton,      New Mexico <strong>WAS TURNED OVER TO THE CITY FOR      MUNICIPAL USE LAST MAY</strong> after logging 587 hours of      successful operation between January 28 and April 9 . . . .      The rapid increase in the popularity of wood stoves may      soon bring on <strong>HIGHER FIRE INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR      HOMEOWNERS</strong> , according to the Insurance      Information Institute (Attn: Ron Vinson, National Press      Building, Washington, D.C. 20045) . . . . Kalwall      Corporation's Solar Components Division is now mailing its      <strong>1978 CATALOG OF SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTS.</strong> If      you haven't ordered your copy already, you can do so now by      sending your name and address (and a token payment . . .      say $1.00) to P.O. Box 237, Dept. TMEN, Manchester, N.H.      03105.    </p>		<hr />
