        <p>Clean your windshield of bugs with a single-edge razor blade; buy them 100 to a box.</p><p>Got a critter between the walls? Turn on two or three radios, full volume, and go to town for half a day. When you come back, the creatures will be gone.</p><p>Don't bother with soap when you wash a car. It takes the wax off and isn't needed 99 percent of the time.</p><p>Give your body to organ donor organizations or a local university for research. Funeral traditions are not enjoyed by or paid for by the dead. I give flowers to living people, not dead.</p><p>Buy a pre-1987 full-size truck, and take care of it. It will only stay the same or go up in value. We have three; one has only 491,000 miles on it.</p><p>Throw away all of your credit cards; pay cash for everything. Avoid new houses and never buy a new vehicle.</p><p><strong>JOHN KNIOCA</strong><br />Vevay, Indiana</p>
