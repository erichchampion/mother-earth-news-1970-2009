    <meta name="description" content="June/July 2002 | The wind picks up as the storm front moves in. While people scurry for cover and the trees dance in the blustery wind, a small machine on a slender pipe stands above the roads, houses and tall trees. It is a wind plant, an electricity generating turbine. A fearless reaper, it pivots on its tower to face the wind, propeller-like rotor already scything around, faster and faster. The rotor turns an attached generator, creating electricity with a simple elegance, carving energy from the sky . By Michael Hackleman and Claire Anderson" />

        Wind maps, like the one above (rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/maps.html), show which regions have at least Class 3 winds sufficient to power a wind plant.
