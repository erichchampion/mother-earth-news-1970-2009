                <p>      <strong>energy & environment</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Carol Steinfeld and Claire Anderson    </h5>        <p>      <strong>C</strong>omposting toilets are a world away from      the odoriferous outhouses of yesteryear. And low-flush      conventional toilets offer an option for those unprepared      to recycle human manure. To save money, extend the life of      your septic system and help protect water quality, read on.      Become a water-wiser watermiser.    </p>    <p>      One person using a composting toilet can produce more than      80 pounds of compost and save more than 6,600 gallons of      water per year. While composting toilets make environmental      sense, they also can put dollars and  cents back into your      pocket by reducing your water bills and extending the life      of your septic system.    </p>    <p>      Composting toilets stabilize and recycle human manure and      toilet paper without using or polluting drinking water.      Unlike flush toilets, which treat human manure as waste, a      composting toilet lets you reclaim and recycle      nutrients-using the same biological process as garden      composting piles to break down excreta, or human manure.      What's left is nutrient-rich organic matter, or humus,      which can be used as a soil amendment.    </p>    <p>      Once considered an option only for parks, homesteaders and      seasonal cottages, composting toilet systems are turning up      in suburban residences and' commercial buildings, often in      environmentally sensitive areas.    </p>    <h3>      Composting toilets    </h3>        <p class="caption">      ADOPTED FROM DELPORTO AND STEINFELD, <em>COMPOSTING TOILET      SYSTEMS</em>    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Composting Toilet      Anatomy    </h3>    <p>      The technology varies, but the typical components of a      composting toilet system include:    </p>    <p>      <strong>1. A waterless toilet stool</strong> or a      microflush toilet;<br />      2. A <strong>composting chamber,</strong> where one or more      dry or microflush toilets empty;<br />      3. A <strong>screened ventilation inlet</strong> ;<br />      4. An exhaust system, often fan-forced, to remove odors,      carbon dioxide and water vapor; and<br />      5. An <strong>access door (5)</strong> to remove the end      product.    </p>		</div>    <p>      Commercial composting toilets first appeared in the United      States in the 1970s, as mostly just a way to avoid      installing a flush toilet and expensive septic system. But      issues of shoddy construction and overoptimistic designs      plagued both the manufactured and build-it-yourself models,      and users struggled with odors, flies, incomplete      processing and hard-to-empty systems. The legal foot came      down in the early 1980s when a report by the U.S.      Environmental Protection Agency and the California Division      of Occupational Safety and Health gave these systems      failing marks. Since then most designs have improved      significantly, reflecting a healthier respect for the      aeration and heat requirements of composting.    </p>    <p>      Many of today's composting toilets can be used with vacuum      toilets (such as the 1 pint microflush SeaLand, originally      made for recreational vehicles and boats) and Japanese      foam-flush toilets (see Page 92 for more information). In      many states, using a composting toilet allows a property      owner to install a smaller septic system. Many owners now      opt for service contracts to maintain their composting      toilet systems.    </p>    <h3>      CARE AND FEEDING    </h3>    <p>      Composting relies on aerobic (oxygen-loving) bacteria that      work 10 to 20 times faster than the anaerobic (oxygenless)      bacteria at work in septic tanks. The challenge of      composting toilets is getting air to the composting process      while minimizing human exposure to the contents. That calls      for careful engineering of airflow, so air is taken in and      then exhausted through the exhaust vent chimney, not      through the bathroom.    </p>    <p>      Some management is also required: turning or batching the      material, and adding coarse material (such as sawdust or      dry leaves) to keep it porous, so the aerobic bacteria stay      healthy and functional.    </p>    <p>      Keeping the material aerated also means it can't be too      wet, so only waterless or microflush toilets are used with      composting toilet systems. Waterless toilets are usually      just toilet stools with 8- or 10-inch openings that connect      through a straight pipe into the composter. For those who      want a toilet trap between themselves and the composter, a      microflush toilet, such as the SeaLand Traveler 1-pint      flush toilet, can be used, provided extra liquid in the      composter is evaporated, drained to a septic system or used      in subsurface irrigation. Other microflush toilets include      foam-flush toilets, which use an aquarium-type air pump to      bubble air through a soap-and-water mixture, creating lots      of foam to move material out of the bowl.    </p>    <p>      Composting toilet systems are not a flush-and-forget      technology. They require consciousness of what's put into      the toilet (No toxic chemicals, please!), some maintenance,      well thought out siting and installation, and in many      cases, electricity for operating fans and heaters.    </p>    <p>      The most common installation mistakes are siting them in      cold places (unheated basements, for example), not draining      away leachate (liquids) and installing systems that are too      small for the usage they'll get.    </p>    <h3>      USING THE END PRODUCT    </h3>    <p>      In composting toilet systems, most pathogens are destroyed      through a combination of heat and retention time. But many      states require the compost toilet end product either to be      hauled off by a sewage hauler or buried under 6 inches of      soil. To comply and still reap the nutrient benefits of      human manure, most folks choose to bury the end product in      the root zone of ornamental plants. Even without legal      approval, some individuals choose to compost the end      product further in an active, outdoor compost pile, or to      use a pasteurizer, such as a solar oven, to destroy      potential pathogens.    </p>    <p>      Will Brinton, Ph.D., of Woods End Research Laboratory has      tested several samples from composting toilets in the past      year. Most of the samples have undergone at least 1 1/2      years of retention time. "In all the samples of composted      human manure we have tested, E. coli pathogens were not      present at levels relevant to the Environmental Protection      Agency's pathogen test rule," says Brinton. "Adequate      composting time and/or temperatures generally will make      human manure safe to use, even though local laws may not      acknowledge this fact. We recommend individuals who wish to      use composted human manure for surface application test for      fecal coliform after the first round of composting."

These      systems are either self-contained (usually for cottages) or      central (also referred to as <em>remote</em> and      <em>below-floor</em> ).    </p>    <p>      With <strong>self-contained systems</strong> , the toilet      seat and a small composter are all one unit. Due to their      small size, they are typically used in cottages and      seasonal homes. Because of their limited capacity, these      systems require frequent emptying, which is accomplished      simply by removing the small tray that sits underneath the      toilet. The end product from these systems can be buried      around trees and shrubs, or composted with other materials      in an outdoor composting bin. Prices range from about $750      to 1,500 for these units. Self-contained systems include      models available from Sun-Mar, Biolet and Envirolet.    </p>    <p>      In a <strong>central system</strong> , the toilet empties      to a separate composting chamber, usually located in the      basement or in its own enclosure to the side of the      building. In these systems, frequent emptying is not      necessary, although you may need to rake the contents      occasionally. When the chamber fills (usually within a      year), the contents-which have composed into a fine,      crumbly product-can be removed with a shovel and      wheelbarrowed out to an outdoor composting bin or buried in      trenches outside. Commonly the choice of year-round homes      and facilities with multiple toilets, central composting      toilets range in price from $1,400 to more than $10,000 for      large-capacity systems. Systems include AlasCan, Clivus      Multrum, CTS, EcoTech Carousel, Phoenix and Sun-Mar      Centrex.    </p>    <h3>      Composting Toilet Sources    </h3>    <p>      <strong>AlasCan</strong><br />      (763) 383-5136<br />      <em>www.alascanofmn.com</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BioLet</strong><br />      (800) 5246538<br />      <em>www.biolet.com</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BioSun</strong><br />      (800) 8478840<br />      <em>www.biosun.com</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Clivus Multrum</strong><br />      (800) 425-4087<br />      <em>www.clivus.com</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>CTS Composting Toilet<br /></strong>      <strong>Systems</strong><br />      (888) 786-4538<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>EcoTech Carousel</strong><br />      (978)369-3951<br />      <em>www.ecological<br /></em>      <em>engineering.com/ecotech.htm</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Envirolet Composting Toilet</strong><br />      (800) 387-5126<br />      <em>www.envirolet.com</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Phoenix Composting Toilet</strong><br />      (406) 862-3854<br />      <em>www.compostingtoilet.com</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sun-Mar Corporation</strong><br />      (905)332-1314<br />      <em>www.sunmar.com</em>    </p>    <h3>      Do It Yourself    </h3>    <p>      Many homeowners make their own systems. Some designs are      simply copies of manufactured systems, such as a concrete      version of sloped, single-chamber systems like the Clivus      Minimus. Other designs use a <strong>batch      approach</strong> with two or more interchangeable      containers: When one fills, another is put into use,      allowing the first container to process without fresh      inputs. The containers are either fixed, as in aerated      twin-bin systems made of concrete (CEPP Net Twin-Bin,      Farallones System, Gap Mountain), or they are alternating      containers, such as barrels and rollaway trash bins (CEPP      NetBarrel, Sol-Latrine, Sunny John). The best designs      feature some kind of management of the leachate and      adequate ventilation for the composting process and odors      (both the books listed in "On the Bookshelf," Page 91, give      detailed information on batch systems). All of these      systems can be used with microflush toilets. The CEPP      NetBarrel system, which can be integrated with a graywater      system, can cost as little as $15 to construct. Add a      1-pint flush toilet, and the total is only $260. These      systems provide as much capacity as one has      containers.<br />    </p>    <p>      Some users bypass composting toilets altogether and use a      very low-tech system, collecting their human manure in a      bucket housed underneath a small built-in cabinet. With a      standard toilet seat and lid on a hinged top, the cabinet      hides the bucket until it's ready to be emptied. A cover      material, such as well-rotted sawdust or finely ground      leaves, is added after each use to act as an odor filter.      When the bucket is full, it's emptied into an outdoor      composting pile. Distinguished from composting toilets, in      which composting takes place within the chamber itself,      these <strong>sawdust toilets</strong> are simple      collection devices; the actual composting occurs along with      veggie peels, grass clippings and other compostables in a      separate, outdoor bin. Direct outdoor composting requires      no fans or electricity, but does require management and      lots of carbon-containing cover material (sawdust, rotted      leaves and straw) to cover the manure for composting.    </p>    <p>      This method probably won't gain approval from most health      officials as a replacement for a flush toilet. Sawdust      toilets are for people who are serious about nutrient      recycling, don't mind the regular job of emptying      containers onto a compost pile and will responsibly manage      the compost to ensure the compost pile achieves      thermophilic conditions (more than 113 degrees) to destroy      pathogens. Because his compost achieves high temperatures      and undergoes two seasons of aging, organic gardener Joseph      Jenkins uses his composted human manure as a garden soil      amendment. In most other composting toilet systems,      although some excreta breakdown occurs within the indoor      chamber, materials usually do not heat up enough to      reliably destroy pathogens. To comply with legal      regulations, most manufacturers advise against using the      end product in food gardens. Jenkins details the      differences between sawdust collection systems and      composting toilet systems in his book, <em>The Humanure      Handbook</em> (See MOTHER'S Bookshelf, Page 103).      Instructions for building a sawdust collection toilet can      be found at      <em>www.jenkinspublishing.com/sawdustoilet.html</em> .    </p>    <p>      Plumber Terry Love says the whoosh of a pressure-assist is      just unfamiliar compared to the gurgle of a gravity-flush      toilet.    </p>    <h3>      THE CURRENT LAWS    </h3>    <p>      Plumbing and wastewater codes usually allow composting      toilets when a conventional septic system or sewer service      is already in place. For all other situations, property      owners may have to get special permits, depending on the      state. Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico and      Washington are among the most accepting. Although National      Sanitation Foundation listed systems are preferred, many      states also approve systems based on their own criteria.      New onsite standards, which may be adopted nationally, will      likely approve any model that features the capacity for      two-year retention of the end product. Given enough      information about the systems, most health officials are      usually willing to work with homeowners. Legal acceptance      of composting toilets is increasing rapidly, as their      benefits become clear to all: no pollution, water and      energy savings, and nutrient recycling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Low-Flush Toilets</strong>    </p>    <p>      For those of us who live in areas where composting toilets      aren't permissible yet, an alternative to water-wasting,      high-volume toilets is low-flush toilets. If you are      planning to build a home, federal law now requires      1.6-gallon low-flush toilets be installed. Older toilets      suck down between 3 to 5 gallons of fresh water with each      flush.    </p>    <p>      According to the American Water Works Association (AWWA),      the average American uses 74 gallons of water per day.      Almost one-third of this water goes to flushing toilets.      Seem wasteful? It is.    </p>    <p>      As demand for pure water grows while fresh water supplies      dwindle, conservation measures must be implemented. A      1.6-gallon low-flush toilet can cut household water usage      by 20 percent or more. The AWWA estimates if every American      household switched to water-efficient toilets 22.3 million      gallons of water would be saved each year.    </p>    <p>      So what's the holdup? Unfortunately, these watermisers      weren't designed well when they were introduced. Folks      frequently faced the fate of double-flushing or, even      worse, clogged toilets. "Back when the lowflush models were      first mandated in 1992, the imported Swedish lowflush      toilets worked great," says David Del Porto, a designer of      water conservation and alternative wastewater systems. "But      U.S. manufacturers didn't change their designs. They just      made smaller tanks." Coupled with old pipes and low      pressure in many older homes, the first U.S. lowflush      toilets were doomed to fail.    </p>    <p>      Now changes in design have produced high-performing      low-flush toilets that can significantly reduce your home      water use and take a load off your septic system.    </p>    <p>      "Today's 1.6-gallon toilets-even the mediocre      ones-are a lot better than the old 5-gallon flush      toilets," says plumber Terry Love, who has sold and      installed low-flush toilets since 1974.    </p>    <p>      Love says the biggest problem is clogging. Some toilets      have sharp edges in their drains that catch toilet tissue      as well as items people drop in toilets, such as makeup      pencils, pens and toys. For that reason, shop for toilets      with smoother edges around the drain and more sweeping      traps with gently angled drains. They simply perform      better. (Toto and most high-end models qualify; see Love's      recommendations on Page 92).    </p>    <h3>      TYPES OF LOW-FLUSH TOILETS    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Gravity-flush toilets</strong> are the most common,      have the simplest design and are usually the least      expensive, ranging in price from $50 to $420. When the      toilet knob is pressed, a flush valve opens, and the water      in the toilet tank drains into the bowl through rim      openings. The force of the water pushes the waste through      the trap and down the drain line. While they are less      effective at removing solid waste than pressure-assisted      toilets, they're generally less expensive and easier to      maintain, since most use standard, widely available parts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pressure-assisted toilets</strong> are suited for      commercial buildings or in homes with poor drain line      carry, where pipes aren't pitched enough to allow waste to      flow easily to the septic system or sewer line. When the      toilet is flushed, the pressure of the water coming into      the main tank compresses air in an inner tank, forcing      water into the bowl and blasting waste down the drain. Some      consider pressure-assisted toilets noisy, although Love      says the <em>whoosh</em> of a pressure-assist is just      unfamiliar compared to the gurgle of a gravity-flush      toilet; Pressure-assisted toilets are more effective in      removing solid waste and limiting odor and soil problems,      but are also a bit more expensive than gravity-tank      toilets; prices usually start around $230.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the greatest advance in water-saving toilets are      the <strong>dual-flush toilets,</strong> which feature two      flush buttons: Press the dark one to flush feces with 1.6      gallons of water or press the light one to flush only urine      with 8 gallon. Caroma's dual-flush from Australia is now      imported to the United States; prices start at $250.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vacuum toilets</strong> use a vacuum pump to suck      waste away. They are expensive and mostly found in ships,      trains or buildings where waste must be moved without the      benefit of gravity. The Seal-and microflush 1-pint toilet      is one of a few toilets made for boats and recreational      vehicles, and for use in composting toilet systems. These      toilets can transport waste a long distance.    </p>    <h3>      TOILET TIPS    </h3>    <p>      Before installing a low-flush toilet, check to make sure      your drain system is working and does not block easily. If      your drain system often clogs, have it fixed, but also      specify a toilet that is rated high for drain line carry.      If your home was built within the last 10 years, any of the      lowflush toilets will work.    </p>    <p>      Love's Web site ( <em>www.terrylove.com</em> ) describes      his favorite low-flush toilets. His first choice? The      UltraMax, a gravity-flush by Toto. "It is a good-looking      one-piece that incorporates a 3-inch flush valve, instead      of the standard 2-inch, which allows the waste to drop      quicker. It meets commercial requirements, works well in a      home and is quieter than the pressure-assisted models." He      says the only drawback may be less bowl wash. Priced around      $350, its a little more expensive than some toilets, but he      thinks it's worth the money.    </p>    <p>      For low-use applications, Love recommends pressure-assisted      Gerber models ($9) to $279), and the gravity-flush American      Standard Cadet ($174) or Western Aris ($99).    </p>    <p>      The economics of flushing with less is apparent: A New York      City program that offers subsidized or free low-flush      toilets in exchange for property owners' 3- and 5-gallon      toilets has saved millions of dollars in water costs since      1992. Nationally, the new lowflush toilets are credited      with saving between 25 and 60 gallons of water per day      each, saving consumers an estimated $50 to $100 on their      annual water bills.    </p>    <p>      "Today's low-flush toilets work," Love says. "And these      days, we just don't have the water to waste."    </p>    <p>      Carol Steinfeld is the co-author of <em>The Composting      Toilet System Book</em> .
