                    <h5 id="byline">      By NANCY BUBEL    </h5>    <p>      September . . . and, as we homestead into a third year,      we're picking vegetables like mad. Corn . . . tomatoes . .      . cabbage . . . broccoli . . . carrots . . . chard . . .      beans . . . beets . . . soybeans . . . celery . . .      potatoes . . . cucumbers . . . squash. Somehow we get it      all canned/frozen/eaten/given/sold. When the garden reaches      its calmer, browner, seedy days later in the fall we'll      spread manure and dolomite. Then, in the winter, we'll toss      wood ashes, sawdust and manure right on the snow. The      earthworms will sleep, deep down. Beginnings? Endings? We      see it more as continuity, the whole vitality of the land.    </p>    <p>      The summer has been good. We've had plenty of      everything-eggs, milk, vegetables . . . and too much      of some. Next year we hope to do better in the fruit      department, though. Our Lodi transparent apple tree bore      three apples this year. Three. We brought the harvest in on      a small plate. Now, what do you do with three cooking      apples? They hung around for a few days till I decided      (stewed 'em with a meal.) We had bought two bushels of      organically grown transparents to make applesauce, but      wanted to experience our OWN apples separately!    </p>    <p>      We camped for a week in West Virginia. Not long enough (or      perhaps short enough!) to become instant experts on      Appalachia and mountain folkways . . . just long enough to      become fascinated by the little towns . . . the spirit of      the mountain people . . . the wells with their buckets at      the ready . . . the marvelous foraging . . . the remedies      and herbs and cookery of people who for years have been      making it on their own. We must go back!    </p>    <p>      Mary Grace has so many wild herbs, remedies, sachets and      herby teas that I've cleared off a shelf just for the      collection. All the fat and charming little jars that have      been too interesting to discard but too small for jelly,      have now found their purpose: mullein salve, borage blossom      syrup, rose oil, sassafras tea. Looks like we're ready for      anything the cold days might bring.    </p>    <p>      Things have been humming in Mike's combination      darkroom-winery. Crocks of brew stand in a row -      mead, rhubarb, blueberry, wineberry and tomato wine. Now's      the time to start wines; fermentation is liveliest when      weather's warm. Winter's for tasting and aging. Some we      sip; some we let age. Next summer we'll break into our      first batch of elderberry wine, aged for two years.    </p>    <p>      A friend gave us a copy of <em>Henley's Twentieth Century      Book of Formulas, Processes and Trade Secrets.</em> An      Everything book. Want to know how to make vinegar,      whitewash, fly paper, soap bubble liquid, glass marking      pencils, how to detect food adulterants, waterproof things,      silver mirrors? It's all here. And more. Good bathroom      reading.    </p>    <p>      Ten year old Greg found a recipe for ginger beer in      Henley's and made a tentative half gallon. It was gone soon      after he uncorked it. Encouraged, he made another batch. By      now he's a ginger beer specialist and branching out into      other home-made soft drinks . . . a version made with      limes, and one with wineberries as a base. He substitutes      honey for the sugar in the recipe and finds that - as      with root beer - you can cut way back on the      sweetening and still have a refreshing drink.    </p>    <p>      The elderberry harvest has been good this month. We've      planted cultivated elders here - Adams and Johns      - and the one by the goat shed, where the manure tea      sluices down in a heavy rain, is a jungle in itself . . . a      big, heavy-bearing berry thicket. Spring a year ago, it was      just a stick on a knobby root. Wow!    </p>    <p>      Funny thing, though. We still go out to pick wild      elderberries. We find them in damp roadside ditches, hidden      gullies, wet meadow edges and along railroad tracks. We      need them . . . and, it seems, we need the searching out,      the feeling of discovery, the acknowledgement of our      dependence on wildness. We always check the plants that      grow around and near the elders where we want to forage. If      there are any indications that the land has been sprayed      for weeds, we don't pick there. (Dead plants, shrivelled up      from the root, have likely been sprayed and are a no-no. If      stubble is left, however, they've been cut. Green light.)    </p>    <p>      No matter how we try to confine it, processing elderberries      is a very purple job. So we do it all at once, wallow in      purple, just let it BE purple while we're working, then mop      it all up. The results are worth it: elderberry syrup, jam,      pie, wine. This year we're trying some dried, as suggested      by Euell Gibbons in <em>Stalking the Wild Asparagus.</em>    </p>    <p>      The children have savored their tenth and twelfth summers,      and now the school bus comes again. The tight rows . . .      the books to be "got through" . . . the half hour bus ride      . . . all still part of the system. But there are other      aspects, too, and some that give us hope: A principal who      knows, talks to and touches the kids . . . a good library,      and they use it . . . new reading classes in which the      children have choice, responsibility, and a hearing for      their ideas . . . classmates and bus pals who live largely      outside the plastic world of color-coordinated garbage      cans, so that what they are seems to loom larger than what      they have. School . . . what is it? How do you find out who      you are?    </p>
