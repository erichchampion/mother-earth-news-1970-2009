                    <p>      A nation's worst pipeline dreams come true.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Tom Turner    </h5>        <p class="caption">      <strong>After making a dramatic comeback, whooping cranes      now face habitat loss in Texas.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>S</strong> AYING "I TOLD YOU SO" ISN'T polite, but      maybe being polite doesn't enjoy such a high priority right      now.    </p>    <p>      Nearly 20 years ago, Friends of the Earth published a book      titled <em>Cry Crisis! Rehearsal in Alaska</em> by Harvey      Manning, a Seattle freelance writer. It was an impassioned      plea that the proposed trans-Alaska pipeline be rerouted to      follow the Alaska Highway through Canada and, ideally, that      the oil be transported by rail rather than by pipe and      tanker. The pipeline was delayed by several years as      litigation proceeded. In the end, Vice President Spiro      Agnew broke a tie vote in the Senate to approve the      pipeline and its environmental impact statement and to bar      further court challenges.    </p>    <p>      <em>Cry Crisis!</em> included worried ruminations about all      manner of perils the pipeline would pose, both to the      tundra and to wildlife (even if it operated as intended)      and to all manner of resources if something should go      wrong. It predicted pollution of the North Slope, which has      occurred.It predicted leaks along the line itself, which      also have occurred.    </p>    <p>      And it predicted catastrophe if there should be a serious      mishap at the terminal at Valdez or in Prince William      Sound. On March 24, that worst of nightmares came true when      the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> ran aground.    </p>    <p>      Let's go ahead and say it: We told you so. There's not a      great deal of satisfaction in that remark. But there is a      renewed plea that warnings like these not go unheeded and      ignored. People warned that nuclear power plants like those      at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl could malfunction,      causing terrible damage. At TMI we may have dodged the      proverbial bullet; in the Ukraine and environs they weren't      so lucky.    </p>    <p>      Environmentalists are telling Congress and the      administration that exploring for oil and gas in the Arctic      National Wildlife Refuge is not worth the risk, which has      now been tragically demonstrated at the end of the pipeline      that new Arctic petroleum would flow through. They're      saying that drilling off both coasts of the United States      is likewise too risky, the benefits too small. They're      insisting that liquidating nearly all the oldg-rowth      forests in the Pacific Northwest will lead to ecological      calamity, including the extinction of the spotted owl and      other species.    </p>    <p>      And yes-let's not shy away from the tough      ones-they're saying that citizens of the United      States and the rest of the world must swiftly and      dramatically alter the way they live their lives. The      automobile culture must give way to its successor. Energy      conservation must become the first priority in any energy      policy.    </p>    <p>      None of this will be easy, but the growing panoply of      warnings-ozone hole, medical-wasted beaches, drought,      fire, oil-soaked birds and otters-should shift considerable      momentum to the side bent on survival.    </p>    <p>      "We told you so" doesn't revivify the hundreds of mammals      and thousands of birds that have perished with Exxon's oil      in their lungs and on their feathers. It may, with luck,      forestall disasters now being sketched on drawing boards      all over the world.    </p>    <h3>      Barges, Boats and Big Birds    </h3>    <p>      As if whooping cranes hadn't weathered enough adversity      already, the big birds are now seeing the shore of their      wintering ground on the Texas coast slowly retreat, a      victim of erosion caused mostly by boat traffic on the Gulf      Intra-coastal Waterway, which slices 12 miles through the      Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.    </p>    <p>      Nearly extinct in the early 1940s, the whoopers have clawed      their way back to the point where now about 200 exist, in      three distinct flocks.    </p>    <p>      One is at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, where      whooper eggs pilfered from the wild are hatched, and the      young reared, by captive-bred sandhill cranes. A second      sandhill-reared flock migrates between Grays Lake, Idaho,      and the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in New      Mexico. The whoopers in this flock have yet to breed.    </p>    <p>      The main flock, numbering 131 by the latest count, spends      its summers in the Yukon Territory and its winters at the      Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, where the latest      trouble has flared up.    </p>    <p>      A few years ago, biologists Johnny French and Pedro Ramirez      of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in Corpus Christi      noticed that the Intra-coastal seemed to be getting wider.      They established that the refuge was being eaten away at an      average rate of three feet per year. French wrote to the      Corps of Engineers, which dredges the Intra-coastal every      few years, demanding that the agency reinitiate      consultation with the FWS under the Endangered Species Act,      a procedure that could lead to new measures to protect the      birds from losing their habitat to erosion.    </p>    <p>      The Corps refused French's request and another by Rogelio      Perez, French's boss.    </p>    <p>      Then, last January, staff attorney Lori Potter of the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, writing on behalf of the      National Audubon Society and the Coastal Bend Audubon      Society, informed the Corps that it was violating the      Endangered Species Act and that she would file suit unless      the agency reinitiated consultation with Fish and Wildlife.    </p>    <p>      On March 17, Col. John Tudela of the Corps' Galveston      office replied that the Corps had relented. A new      biological assessment will be prepared, and consultation      will be reinitiated if it seems warranted.    </p>    <p>      Final resolution of the problem almost certainly will rest      with Congress. The ideal solution, according to FWS      biologists, would be to move the Intracoastal out of the      refuge altogether, which would be expensive. Another      possibility is to stabilize the banks of the waterway with      riprap or some kind of matting. Simply controlling the      volume and speed of ship traffic might be enough to stop      the erosion. Time will tell. The whoopers are too precious      to gamble with.    </p>    <p>      <em>For more information, write Sierra Club Legal Defense      Fund, 2044 Fillmore St., San Francisco, CA 94115.</em>    </p>
