                <p>      <strong>			SEASONS OF THE GARDEN			</strong>    </p>        <p>      Homemade compost prevents fungal disease in gardens.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>             <p><strong>FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WEST GERMAN</strong>      agronomists have been using liquid extracts made from      compost as preventive fungicides for garden crops. Plants      treated with compost extracts have shown enhanced      resistance to various fungi that cause blights and mildews.      Indeed, the extracts have successfully prevented late      blight of tomatoes and potatoes; anthracnose and powdery      mildew on grapes; botrytis blight of beans; and more. (The      extracts <em>won't cure</em> infected plants-they are      a preventive only.)    </p>    <p>      To make a batch of the extract, simply mix one part      well-rotted compost (that contains a mixture of plant      matter and animal manure) with six parts water. Stir well.      Let the mixture stand for about a week, then filter it      through cheesecloth. Spray the liquid (undiluted) on      plants, or use it to soak seeds overnight.    </p>    <p>      The German researchers say that compost extracts cause      surface concentrations of phenols (chemicals that are toxic      to fungi) to increase considerably. This results in induced      resistance to fungal infections. Extracts from compost      containing (any kind of) animal manure result in much      better resistance than ones from only plant material.    </p>    <p>      Plant resistance typically declines about seven to 10 days      after treatment, so for best results, repeat applications      every five to seven days.    </p>    <h3>      Research Briefs    </h3>    <p><strong>      Bleach summer seeds.</strong>     </p>    <p>      To get good lettuce germination at high (85째-95째F)      temperatures, first bleach the seeds. So say British      researchers who soaked the seeds for a couple of hours in a      50째F solution with about 10% available chlorine. The      result? Seeds that normally had a germination rate of under      10% (at 95째) had a 50% sprouting rate, and 40%      germinators jumped to almost 100%. Apparently, bleaching      slightly weakens the seed coat. Indications are that the      technique should work on some other crops as well.    </p>     <p><strong>      Don't mess when stressed.</strong>     </p>    <p>      North Carolinian Noel Lykins raises prize roses that are      totally dependent on rainfall for moisture. He's found that      during prolonged droughts, stopping all normal cultural      practices (including fertilizing, pest control, pruning and      even cutting flowers) results in best plant survival. When      the roses show signs of recovery, he resumes regular care.<strong>      Biocontrol's centennial.</strong>      Does the idea of importing "good" insects to control "bad"      ones still sound a little too novel or untried? Actually,      the practice of biological control turns 100 this year. In      1889, cottony-cushion scale insects threatened to destroy      California's fledgling citrus industry. USDA scientists      imported 129 Australian vedalia beetles, which spread and      completely wiped out the threat. Biocontrol was a standard      method for pest-and even weed-control until the      1940s, when DDT and other insecticides entered the scene.      Now, with rising concern for the chemicals' side effects      (and diminished effectiveness), biocontrol is back.    </p>     <p><strong>Okra in the bag.</strong></p><p>According to Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station      researchers, storing okra pods in polyethylene bags does      much more to lengthen storage life than quickly cooling      them. To keep your okra fresh longest, store it in a      plastic bag in the refrigerator.    </p>    <h3>      Gleanings    </h3>    <p>      Growers in the Pacific Northwest have had great success      using shiny red and silver Mylar tape to keep birds away      from ripening fruits. The 7/16-inch-wide tape is pulled out      from the center of the roll so it spirals, then is staked      around strawberry rows or hung on individual fruit trees.      The tape is sold in 290-foot rolls, for $1.49 each plus      postage, from Modern Agri-Products, 103 Third St., Lynden,      WA 98264 . . . . Dozens of inexpensive horticultural and      agricultural programs for personal computers are available      from the North Central Computer Institute, 667 WARE Office      Bldg., 610 Walnut St., Madison, WI 53705 (send $2.75 for      NCCI's software catalogue) . . . . A good source for such      hard-to-find seed-saving supplies as silica gel, vials and      desiccants is the Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, P.O. Box      158, North Garden, VA 22959 (catalogue $3) . . . . The      videotape "Beautiful Gardens With Less Water" ($16.95 from      Sunset Films and Television, 625 Market St. Penthouse, San      Francisco, CA 94105) includes tips on home landscape design      for low water use, selection of irrigation equipment, and      mulching techniques . . . . Many British growers have used      translucent tubes called Treeshelters to promote the growth      of seedling trees while also protecting them from wildlife.      Now they're available in the U.S. from FE&T, 75 Bidwell      St., Suite 105, St. Paul, MN 55107.    </p>    <p>      <em>Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their food on a      small farm and publish Hort-Ideas, a fine newsletter on      gardening research and products ($15 a year from G. &      P.
