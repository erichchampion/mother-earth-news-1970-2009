                    <h3>B. TOUCHSTONE HARDAWAY</h3>    <p>      It can be a ticklish thing, this baking bread on a      wood-burning range the first time. I have had many a      failure and many successes. We eat the failures as well as      the successes.    </p>    <p>      This is a basic whole wheat recipe I'd like to share with      you:    </p>    <p>      2-1/2 cups milk, scalded<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      1 tablespoon salt<br />      1/2 cup nutritional yeast<br />      One pkg. active dried yeast softened in<br />      1/2 cup lukewarm water<br />      3 tablespoons cooking oil<br />      6 to 8 cups wholewheat flour<br />    </p>    <p>      Blend milk, honey, salt and nutritional yeast. When this      cools to lukewarm, add softened yeast, oil and three cups      of the flour. Beat until bubbles rise to the surface. Add      enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough that      comes away clean from the sides of bowl. Turn dough onto      floured surface and let rest ten minutes. Then knead until      smooth and elastic. Place in oiled bowl, turning dough over      several times to coat with oil. Cover. Let rise again.      Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Shape into balls and      let stand for five minutes, then mold into loaves. Place in      oiled bread pans. Let rise until nearly doubled in bulk,      about an hour. Bake about an hour in moderately hot oven.    </p>    <p>      I always start my fire when I place loaves in bread pans      for last rising, which takes about 30 or 40 minutes. This      gives the fire time to get "moderately" hot.    </p>    <p>      My oven has a temperature gauge which says simply      SLOW-MODERATE-HOT. No numbers for degrees, just      those three words. When that needle registers HOT, let me      tell you, it is exactly that. I would judge it to be about      a thousand degrees in the oven.    </p>    <p>      So you'll want to "baby" your fire on bread baking day.      Sometimes in spite of all I can do, the fire will nearly      reach the HOT mark before I can slow 'er down. Then I call      upon that modern invention, aluminum foil and make a nice      little cap over all three loaves. After that, the old fire      can get as hot as it likes while the bread cooks to      perfection inside. If I am out of foil, I put a large tray      or several lids on top of the loaves after they have      crusted over. This is not too desirable, but will do in a      tight. Even then, sometimes, I have to leave the oven door      ajar.    </p>    <p>      This doesn't happen too often, but it does happen      occasionally. (I like to think of these times as some more      of that character-building stuff I mentioned.)    </p>    <p>      If you place a pan of water on the floor of the oven under      the loaves, it seems to give them volume and keeps the      temperature easier to control. The bread is delicious and      well worth the effort.    </p>
