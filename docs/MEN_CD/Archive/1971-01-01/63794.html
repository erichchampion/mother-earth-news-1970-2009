                    <h5 id="byline">      by ROBERTA HAMMER    </h5>        <p>      The three main reasons for starting poultry on a homestead,      in case you haven't given it much thought, are: (1) Fresh,      fertile, organic eggs, (2) Fresh, fertile, organic chicken      manure and (3) Fresh, organic chicken meat (unless, of      course, you're vegetarian-in which case the first two      points are reason enough . . . and if you're a <em>super      strict</em> vegetarian, No. 2 alone will <em>still</em>      justify the project.)    </p>    <p>      You might have thought that eggs-any eggs-are      organic. No, they aren't. Most supermarket eggs come from      egg factories <em>(see HEALTH IS FOR THE BIRDS, in this      issue)</em> where chickens are confined to small wire cages      stacked in endless rows. The layers are never allowed to      set their chicken feet on the ground . . . or even stretch      their wings, I guess.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, such living conditions, even for birds,      are BAD. Disease would run rampant were it not for      antibiotics that are automatically fed as a preventative.      The average life span of one of these chickens is 18 months      and the eggs laid in an egg factory are-to say the      least-tasteless. Their nutritional value is      questionable and their possible antibiotic content is      deplorable. So, since one of the reasons for moving back to      the land was wholesome, natural food for our family . . .      chickens!    </p>    <p>      The little grocery-feed store in our area offered some      special chick bargains last spring. One was 100 heavy-breed      cockerels free with the purchase of 250 lbs. of chick      starter. The store also offered other chicks at wholesale      prices.    </p>    <p>      We decided on a heavy breed of chicken because we like big,      brown eggs; we think the larger birds offer the tastiest      meat; we wanted to look at chickens that were some color      other than white; and we didn't care for the nervous little      Leghorns, bred to be egg-producing machines.    </p>    <p>      We ordered straight-run chicks. This means that, at the      hatchery, the baby chickens were boxed without being sexed.      There's no guarantee on how many of either sex will be in      any order of straight-runs but it usually averages about      50-50 and straight-run chicks cost several  cents less each      than sexed chicks. If you'll be eating some (or all) of      your chickens anyway, straight-runs are the best buy.    </p>    <p>      Straight-run chicks are a double good buy if you want some      roosters in your flock . . . and we wanted roosters: (1) To      insure the production of fertile eggs (thought to be more      nutritious), (2) To allow us to try raising our own      chickens from the eggs up and (3) For wake-up crowing in      the morning.    </p>    <p>      Poultry books and pamphlets we consulted (including the      <em>HA</em> <em>VE-MORE Plan</em> in MOTHER NO. 2) suggest      that you order three times as many straight-run chicks as      you want laying hens. This allows for chicks that grow up      to be roosters, deaths or disablements from disease and the      hens that, for some reason, never lay. Since we figured      that twenty-five was a nice number of hens to start with,      we ordered 75 straight-run assorted heavy breeds at      15 cents per chick. We were told that they would be mailed      in about two weeks. Yes, <em>mailed.</em> In a cardboard      box.    </p>    <p>      Two weeks is plenty of time to get a chicken place ready.      The 24-acres we bought had, as outbuildings, only a shed      big enough for our three goats and a falling down two-story      house. We had already salvaged one room of the old house as      a painting studio so we decided we could salvage another      room for a chicken place.    </p>        <p>      The room we decided on had windows facing the north, west      and south. Chickens need a warm southern exposure in the      winter but they don't need drafts from the north so we cut      the north window down and made it into a door. Keith built      the door out of plywood and 2X4 scraps and it has a hinged      trapdoor at the bottom so that the main panel can be kept      closed in cold weather.    </p>    <p>      We covered the other two windows with chicken wire and      built outside shutters (to be closed in the winter) for the      one on the west. After covering several holes in the wall      with plywood scraps (to keep out rats and cats), we cleaned      and swept the place.    </p>        <p>      If you start chickens in an old chicken house, you'll have      to remove all old litter and dirt as there are a jillion      chicken diseases and the germs can hide a long time. Many      old farms have a little shed or building that was intended      for chicken brooding. You still gotta clean it out and it's      a good idea to hose the inside down or wet broom it all      over with a disinfectant. Watch out for the inevitable      wasps!    </p>    <p>      The next thing you'll need for your chicks is litter. You      have to put something down to absorb the chicken droppings      and keep the floor dry. The best litter we've found is      sawdust. We buy it from a saw mill for $1.25 a pickup load,      put down a little sand first and spread an inch or two of      sawdust evenly over the floor. As the litter becomes dirty,      we spread more sawdust on top. With this method, you clean      out the whole thing only twice a year and put it on your      garden or compost heap. While you're cleaning the chicken      house, of course, you concentrate on the beautiful      vegetables you'll harvest as a result.    </p>    <p>      Chicken litter must be kept dry. If it becomes damp or      soaked from rain or spilled water. remove the wet and put      down fresh. Disease germs thrive in damp litter and      chickens do not. Straw (even shredded straw, which we      tried) does not make good litter. It's not absorbent      enough. You can use newspapers in a pinch but they must be      changed every day. All this is not as complicated as it      sounds, by the way. Chickens help keep their litter dry by      scratching around and stirring it up.    </p>    <p>      One piece of equipment you'll need is a brooder. Chicks are      24-72 hours old when you receive them and, for the first      four to six weeks, they must be kept warm! Hold your      brooder at 90Â° F for the initial week or ten days, then      gradually reduce it to normal temperatures.    </p>    <p>      We were lucky enough to find a 25 year old electric brooder      that had been lying around an uncle's farm . . . and it      still works! The brooder has a thermostat, a removable      thermometer and a little fan inside to distribute the heat.      A small light bulb (also inside attracts the chicks to the      warmth and another bulb on the outside shows when the      heating element is on.    </p>    <p>      If you don't have or can't locate a brooder, you can find      or make a sort of hover or giant, reflecting lamp shade. By      using different sizes of bulbs and raising and lowering the      hover, you can regulate the temperature. It will, of      course, take a lot of watching and checking. Be sure to put      a thermometer down at chick level.    </p>    <h3>      DICK SHUTTLEWORTH'S CHICKEN FEEDER    </h3>        <p>      When chickens are little you can feed them out of flat feed      troughs but feeder that holds about 100 pounds of mash.      Here's a nifty feeder that dad designed and which we used      for years and years when we raised a lot of chickens. It's      made of scrap pieces of 1 X 12 and 1 X 4 and a few other      odds and ends. We'll have detailed plans for you in MOTHER      NO. 8.-JS    </p>        <p>      Since our chicken room is big and high-ceilinged, we      ordered the chicks to arrive the last part of May when the      weather would be warmer. Altogether, we used the brooder      about four weeks and it added approximately $8.00 to our      electricity bill.    </p>    <p>      The only other hardware you'll need right away are waterers      and feeders especially made for little chicks. Most poultry      books have specifications for feeders and you can build      them yourself. You can also improvise waterers of      mayonnaise jars and pie pans for a few days as we did.      Knock a little chip out of the rim of each jar, being      careful to keep the indentation shallower than the rim of      the pan in which it is set. Pretty soon, though, the chicks      will get frisky enough to knock over such a rig. Gallon      size waterers (they cost $4.00 to $5.00 new) are much      better and I'm sure there are old, unused ones around.      There are also chick waterers that screw onto mason jars.    </p>    <p>      Our baby chickens arrived one day late. Surprisingly, they      looked none the worse for their stay in the cardboard box.      We dipped the beak of each one into warm water and set the      babies under the brooder. You should make a fence of      cardboard or sheet metal to keep the chicks from wandering      away and losing the warm place. After a couple of weeks you      can begin moving the fence (gradually!) away from the      heater. Round off any square corners with cardboard because      if the chicks become chilled they may pile up in a corner      and smother the little guys on the bottom.    </p>        <p>      Baby chicks are just as cute as you remember and we      couldn't stay away from ours the first few days. We had      three different types: Traditional yellow fluff; brown with      darker brown stripes on their backs; and beige with brown      stripes. The yellow ones grew up white (probably Plymouth      Rocks), the brown are now beautiful reddish-brown with      black tails (maybe a Rhode Island Red cross) and the beige      matured into white with black spots (possibly Barred Rock).    </p>    <p>      We were fortunate enough to meet an organic farmer      who-though our age and raised in the      suburbs-has lived on his farm for 10 years. We ask      his advice on most farm-type ventures. When we inquired      about commercial chick starters, he told us that hatchery      chicks are not nearly as hardy as farm-raised and we should      probably use the widely-sold medicated mash for a few      weeks. I asked at the feed store to see the list of      ingredients in chick starter and found that it contains      many grains, lots of synthetic vitamins (even some HEW      doesn't recognize as essential to people) and a form of      antibiotic called <em>Amprolium.</em> We didn't want      antibiotics in our eggs or chicken meat so we decided to      feed the medicated mash for as short a period as possible.    </p>    <p>      The chicks filled out and grew <em>very</em> fast on the      starter and were sprouting little wing feathers in one      week. By the time they were two weeks old they were already      scraggy and homely looking. Then, at two to three weeks of      age, a few of our chicks developed coccidiosis. Or, at      least, that's what the symptoms appeared to be (there's      nothing like pouring over a good book of chicken diseases!)    </p>    <p>      The sick chicks looked droopy, weak and had dirty behinds.      Occasionally we'd see blood in the droppings. We removed      the sick ones to a little pen where they either got better      or died. We only lost 6 or 7 chicks and learned that some      poultry raisers allow a mild outbreak of coccidiosis as an      immunization.    </p>    <p>      When we finally got the chicken fence built (ask someone      else how to put up chicken wire . : . apparently we don't      know how), the chicks came pouring out the door like a      flood. They wanted to be outside and they <em>needed</em>      to be outside for vitamin D from the sun, grit and minerals      from the ground and whatever bugs and green leaves they      could find.    </p>    <p>      At about four weeks, we started adding wheat and cracked      corn to the chicken's diet and slowly eliminating the mash      (which is expensive). Then we added some oats and soybean      meal and a little meat scrap (bought in 50 lb. bags). In      addition, we now feed the birds the yellow, fat cucumbers,      rotten or buggy tomatoes, squishy squash and pumpkins, old      lettuce and other spoiled vegetables from our garden. They      also eat most of the kitchen waste, even crushed egg      shells.    </p>    <p>      We've now built a roost out of 2X2s that were beveled with      a planer. Just under the roost is a piece of screen wire to      keep the chickens out of the droppings and to catch any      eggs laid from that vantage point. At the front is a hinged      door to facilitate the mining of that garden gold.    </p>    <p>      Although we haven't constructed one yet, a feeder and      waterer platform would save a lot of labor since the      chickens scratch around a lot and get litter into these      self-serve utensils. A four-inch high platform covered with      screen wire could be made big enough for the waterers and      feeders and rows of chickens around each one.    </p>        <p>      When our chicks were six weeks old we bought six Araucana,      or Easter egg chickens, from a lady who lives near us.      These are the beautiful little birds with a gamey      appearance (developed by the Araucana Indians of Peru) that      lay either pink, blue or beige eggs. About the same age as      the other chickens (but newcomers), the Araucanas are      considered at the bottom of the pecking order by the      original flock. There's no need to worry about the perky      little birds, though. Araucanas can dodge, fly, flit and      skitter out of reach in a way that makes the other chickens      look clumsy.    </p>    <p>      We paid 75 cents each for the Araucanas and the lady had      started pullets (birds about ready to lay) for $1.50      apiece. Buying such pullets is a good way to start a laying      flock for those who have the money and inclination.    </p>    <p>      At the same time we bought the Araucanas. we enlarged our      poultry holdings by one pair of two year old geese that      cost us $6.00. Geese are really fun to have around. Ours      walk haughtily around the yard eating grass and an      occasional handful of corn. Otherwise they need no care . .      . except a simple shelter in the winter. They take a daily      dip in what used to be the kids' wading pool, but really      need swimming water only at breeding and nesting time.    </p>    <p>      The lady who sold us ours says that geese usually hatch two      nests of eggs in the spring and the gander gets a little      cranky when the hen starts to lay. Once she's brooding      eggs, however, she chases him away and he comes      around-honking forlornly-seeking human      companionship.    </p>        <p>      Our geese, gray and white-the gander with bright      orange bill and feet-are beautiful birds. They follow      us around but will only let us pet them at night, when we      are sitting outside and THEY approach US. If we don't      barricade the porch, they like to sleep right in front of      the door.    </p>    <p>      As I write this, our chickens are three months old and the      roosters have bigger combs and wattles than the pullets. It      will be a few months before we get much return from them.      Heavy breed pullets don't start to lay until around six      months old and they don't lay much in cold weather. So it      may be spring before we see an egg.    </p>    <p>      We have eaten only one chicken so far. Although he looked      nice and fat, it was mostly bluff and feathers. The      drumsticks were really dainty! The actual butchering was      unpleasant but bearable. We believe in the Indian way of      explaining to an animal why you need it.    </p>    <p>      Besides the three reasons mentioned in the first paragraph      for having poultry, there's another one: FUN! Lots of      evenings we sit by the chicken pen watching the chicken      society. The adolescent roosters have mock cock fights, the      pullets chase the little crooked footed one into the bushes      and Araucanas sail over the fence like doves. The geese      then come whirling by, flapping their wings (maybe keeping      in shape in case they ever want to fly off). Then the geese      stop, touch their bills lightly together and GANAWK!      loudly, talking to each other.    </p>    <p>      I wonder where we can find some ducks.    </p>
