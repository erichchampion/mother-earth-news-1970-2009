                <p>      <em>sThe following letter from George Bumpus was originally      published in the TRIBES column, edited by Alice 2, of the      GEORGIA STRAIGHT, 56A Powell St., Vancouver 4, British      Columbia, Canada. Weekly, $7.00 a year. Get it. It's the      best alternatives newspaper in the world.<br /></em><br />    </p>        <p>      Even though there is a natural tendency for newcomers to      the north to be overly worried about cold winters, it is      true that the best time to start a commune or homestead is      in the spring or early summer. This will allow you enough      time to get properly set up for the first winter which will      then be a pleasant part of the year.    </p>    <p>      The most important priorities for folks who have only land      are: (1) Start a garden and (2) Construct a good shelter.    </p>    <p>      Log cabin construction is the best and least expensive.      Placing the logs vertically is the easiest way to build.      Then chink between them with fiberglass insulation      or-if you have little bread-chink with moss. If      the logs are horizontal, you can even use mud.    </p>    <p>      It's best to use spruce or pine for your cabin but, in      spite of what the experts say, poplar logs work fine if      they're all you have. Poplar will shrink very little but is      sensitive to dampness so try to use a few logs of pine or      spruce right down on the ground. If the poplar has a chance      to dry a few days after its bark is peeled, it will remain      a pretty, light color. Otherwise, if it happens to rain on      your poplar logs as they're drying, the wood will turn      blackish. Don't worry about it; the poplar is still OK to      use.    </p>    <p>      Your cabin floor should be constructed of two layers of      one-inch lumber with building paper sandwiched in between.      Use pine or spruce for ceiling and roof rafters. If you      have to use poplar for the rafters, allow it to dry first      or it will sag under its own weight. Nail one-inch lumber      on the rafters and cover this ceiling with about four      inches of sawdust (free for the taking from almost any      mill). Rough lumber, by the way, is good enough to use for      your rustic home and you can purchase it from any of      several small mills for around $40/1,000 board feet.    </p>    <p>      Stock up on lots of firewood. For this, and the building of      the log cabin, used chain saws can be purchased for $20 up.      Cut your wood early so it will have a chance to dry before      winter sets in because it's a real nuisance to try to heat      a cabin with green wood. Ten cords is usually enough to      hold an average-sized cabin through the winter.    </p>    <p>      There are several government wood lots throughout the      region. People can go into these lots and cut free firewood      (this is important to anyone who has no timber on their      land). The Forestry Department can tell you where the lots      are located.    </p>    <p>      A young milk goat is nice to have for milk, cheese and      cream (you'll need a separator for the cream). Goats thrive      on brush, willows, weeds and grass and require relatively      little hay during the winter. If you keep a goat, though,      you'll find it necessary to fence in the garden with poles      or wire four to five feet high. Goats love gardens.    </p>    <p>      You can further augment the food supply with snowshoe      rabbits, grouse, moose and-this year      particularly-a few deer. There is no closed season on      rabbits. If you get a moose or deer early in the fall, I      advise that you can most of it right away. A deer or moose      killed after freeze-up will keep very nicely just hung up      outside in an exposed, dry, shaded area.    </p>    <p>      Most of the lakes have either trout or squaw fish in them.      Trout, as you know, are good eating. Squaw fish are too,      even though full of bones. If you pickle the fish, even the      bones can be eaten.    </p>    <p>      Wild berries-huckleberries, strawberries,      raspberries, saskatoonberries and blueberries-are      plentiful most summers.    </p>    <p>      If you like Mexican food, as my wife and I do, you can make      it with little expense. The <em>Sunset Mexican Cook      Book</em> from Lane Books in Menlo Park, California tells      how to make a tortilla press. Mesa flour for tortillas can      be obtained from Woodwards food floor in Prince George.    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind two very important things when acquiring      property in the Prince George area. You should: (1) Make      sure that water is easily available and (2) Have the      quality of the soil analyzed by the Department of      Agriculture in Prince George. If you don't want to check      the soil, at least talk to people who live in the area in      which your prospective homestead is located. You can't      believe what salesmen tell you, as most everyone knows.    </p>    <p>      Some folks try to do too much the first summer. I think      it's better to set your goals a little lower at first.      There's always next year to build the garage, dig the well,      put in the inside plumbing or whatever. These things are      all nice but-unless you have a lot of help-they      can wait.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Peace,<br />      George<br />      Bumpus</strong>    </p>    <p>      FLASH: A letter from George Bumpus, received as this issue      went to press, says, "There has been a recent change in the      British Columbia law that makes part of my article      inaccurate. Tax land sales have been postponed indefinitely      and land can no longer be pre-empted. Crown Land can now be      purchased only by farmers who already have at least 160      acres."    </p>    <p>      Cheer up, gang. It's not that bad. The best land was      already taken long ago and is safely in private hands. And      remember what George told you in his article? . . . that      private land is still selling for as little as $35.00 an      acre.-JS.    </p>
