                    <p>      <em>"There's a woman on Hinkle Mountain who has strange      feelings on two subjects. First, she says there's nothing      wrong with ending a sentence with a preposition, and      second, she says talking about bad weather makes it come.      The other day she remarked, `Oh, let's be cheerful. Why      bring weather that one would rather stay in out of up for?'      "</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline"><em>by Jim Comstock</em></h5>    <p>      Well sir, even Ott Bartlett (who's been around so long thet      iffen <em>he</em> don't remember somethin', it ain't nev'r      happened) has already broke down an' admitted thet this      here's the hottest summer in the entire history of Barren      County. An' whilst the stories goin'      around-concernin' corn poppin' on the stalk an' hens      layin' cooked eggs . . . city folks runnin' their drinkin'      water through electric heaters to cool it off an' country      people pullin' theirs already boilin' outa their wells . .      . an' even goosedrownin' thundershowers not coolin' things      off 'cause all them raindrops was evaporatin' afore they      hit the ground-cain't quite be taken as gospel,      they's a speck er more of truth in 'em!    </p>    <p>      As you might imagine, then, most of the residents of      Plumtree Crossin' has been movin' slower'n Congress in this      weather (iffen they move at all). An' naturally enough,      about the least active folks in theentire community is thet      cluster of porch-perched cronies known as the Truth an'      Veracity League. Them pillars of imperturbability is      spendin' pretty much all their time with their heads hid      under widebrimmed hats an' their backs melted agin' their      chairs.    </p>    <p>      A few days back, though, of Newt Blanchard did manage to      start up his lungs long enough to tell Billy      Parsons-seein' as Billy's the youngest member of the      group-to walk inside the store an' fetch his elder a      nice cool Nehi orange. Well, Billy reluctantly peeled      hisself off'n his roost an' kinda <em>oozed</em> inta the      store. A good ten minutes later, the youngster'd made it      back out an' was fixin' to hand the bottle to Newt when he      noticed he'd plumb fergot to open it.    </p>    <p>      "Nevi mind," said Newt, reachin' inta his pocket. "I got an      open'r."    </p>    <p>      Relieved thet he wouldn't have to make another round trip,      Billy collapsed on the settin' bench. Newt pried open his      soda (which he allowed were so warm already thet he      practically had to blow on it afore he could drink it),      took a deep swig, an' said, "Now I know all you fellers kin      keep a secret, so I'm fixin' to tell you somethin'. This      here ain't my bottle opener . . . it belongs to Cleedy      McCannon."    </p>    <p>      It were a good five minutes later when one of the boys      (Skeeter Ridges, I b'lieve) stretched open his yapper long      enough to comment. "So what?" he asked.    </p>    <p>      An' Newt (after a consider'ble pause hisself) replied, "You      mean you ain't heered tell of the McCannons' picnic?"    </p>    <p>      Well, another few minutes passed afore anyone got up the      energy to snap at Newt's bait. Finally, though, Clarence      Smithers mumbled, "What picnic?"    </p>    <p>      "Iffen someone'll fetch me a honest-to-God cool soda, I'll      tell about it." An' after Billy got back (he did seem to      move a <em>bit</em> quicker this time) with a second Nehi,      Newt proceeded to elocutionate the followin' tale.    </p>    <p>      Back around the end of June (Newt began), jist a couple of      weeks after this roof-blisterin' hot spell begun, an'      whilst some folks was still foolish enough to try an' do      things once't in a while, the McCannons took it inta their      minds to head off to the cove thet runs up behind their      place fer a family picnic. So Cleedy, his wife Sadie, an'      their eight-year-old young'un Buckeye started packin' up      food baskets. They loaded 'em with bottles of soda, peanut      butter sandwiches, fruit salad, baloney, pickles, fried      chicken legs, tollhouse cookies, potato salad, hot dogs an'      bread rolls, half a watermelon, an' about two dozen other      kinds of eatables.    </p>    <p>      Fact is, it took them folks about five hours to pack . . .      mostly 'cause Buckeye-a cussed little critter what's      feistier'n a teenage bobcat-kept insistin' thet his      fav'rite food should be packed right on top of the basket      so's not to git squashed . . . an' then changin' his mind      about jist what vittles he liked best.    </p>    <p>      Eventually er so, the McCannons got ev'rything sorted out,      an' off they set. Now 'twern't really all thet far to the      clearin' where they was fixin' to eat, but ain't nobody      about to walk fast in this heat . . . an' the McCannons is      slow movers in the best of times. So what with carryin'      those heavy baskets an' havin' to rest ev'ry few yards an'      all, it were three full days afore they reached their      picnic spot.    </p>    <p>      O'course, the whole family were a bit peaked with hunger by      the time they finally got there, so they all set to it an'      helped spread the tablecloth an' unpack the eats.      Howsomev'r, they was jist about to chow down when Sadie      said, "Wait! We cain't eat yet. Where in tarnation's thet      bottle opener?"    </p>    <p>      They all put their food down an' went to searchin' fer thet      top popper. They shook out all the baskets, peeked under      ev'ry plate an' container, an' poked around in all their      pockets, but they couldn't find the blamed thing nowhere.      Finally, Miz McCannon turned to her husband an' said,      "Cleedy, you left it to home, an' somebody's got to go      fetch it."    </p>    <p>      Well, her of man scowled back like a hound-hemmed bear thet      were ready to fight to the death. So without sayin' another      word to each other, they both turned their heads an' each      fixed a pair of full-bore, double-barrel glares on little      Buckeye.    </p>    <p>      "I ain't movin'!" yipped the youngster.    </p>    <p>      "But we cain't drink the sodas without we got the opener,"      Sadie explained in a voice like a saber saw cuttin' tin.    </p>    <p>      "Well, I ain't goin' after it. I ain't, I ain't, I ain't!      You two'll eat up ev'ry blessed bite afore I git back."    </p>    <p>      "Why boy," crooned Cleedy, "we'd nev'r do a thing like      thet."    </p>    <p>      "Yes you would too," Buckeye snapped.    </p>    <p>      "Oh no, no, we <em>promise</em> we won't," said his mama      an' daddy.    </p>    <p>      "Cross yet heart an' swear you won't set tooth in a single      thing whilst I'm gone?" Buckeye demanded.    </p>    <p>      "Cross our hearts an' swear!" they said.    </p>    <p>      "Oh, spit!" Buckeye groaned, defeated . . . an' he turned      around an' started walkin'. Cleedy an' Sadie watched the      lad trudge inta the woods an' outa sight. Then they turned      an' stared at the sandwiches an' meat an' salad an' fruit      spread out ready. A day passed . . . another day passed . .      . an' a <em>third</em> day passed.    </p>    <p>      "Dadburn it, Sadie," Cleedy said, "thet boy ain't back      <em>yet . . .</em> let's eat." But Sadie looked at her      husband through the Eyes of Judgment theyselves. "We      <em>promised,</em> Cleedy," she said.    </p>    <p>      Two more days passed. Cleedy was gettin' powerful hungry,      an' Sadie looked a smidge more'n ravenous herself. Still      they waited . . . an' waited.    </p>    <p>      Finally, eight long days since they'd last seen Buckeye,      Cleedy croaked, "Sadie, I cain't hold on enny longer. We've      jist <em>got</em> to eat . . . one little sandwich, Sade,      jist <em>one."</em>    </p>    <p>      With some effort, the woman turned her head toward her      spouse. "I guess Buckeye'll understand ifhen we eat jist      one sandwich."    </p>    <p>      Well, they both lunged an' picked up a sandwich together.      They pulled it right up to their mouths, too, an'-at      thet very instant-Buckeye appeared at the edge of the      clearin'. "I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!" he screamed,      jumpin' up an' down. "I knew you'd cheat!" An' with a smug      smile on his face, he added, "It sure is a good thing <em>I      didn't</em> go back fer thet bottle opener!"    </p>    <p>      Once't the boys'd all had a prolonged fit of laughter at      the story (an' considerin' the heat, both the laughin' an'      the tellin' was impressive feats fer sure), Lafe Higgins      finally wiped his eyes an' said, "But Newt, what's thet got      to do with you havin' the open'r?"    </p>    <p>      "Well," replied Mister Blanchard, "Cleedy (ergot thet the      day afore he started out on thet picnic, him an' me was      sippin' Nehi right here on this porch. It seems thet the      last time he handed me his open'r, I accident'ly kept the      thing . . . an' I be blamed if I got the courage now to go      up to his place an' give it back!"    </p>    <p>      "The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to      overlook."    </p>    <p>      William James    </p>
