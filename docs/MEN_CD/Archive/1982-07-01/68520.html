                <p>      If you've got travel in your blood but only a little cash      in your pocket, consider constructing.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Robert Pentecost    </h5>          <p>      I've been a fan of the great outdoors since my youth, but      once I became a family man, I had to think about changing      the <em>manner</em> in which I visited the wilds. You see,      though all of the Pentecost clan enjoys camping, we don't      all appreciate middle-of-the-night close encounters with      wild critters . . . and needless to say, the prices of      recreational trailers have gone far beyond the reach of      many folks, including us.    </p>    <p>      I didn't, however, let a mere lack of funds prevent our      traveling around and experiencing the thrill of new and      distant places. Rather than shell out hard-earned cash for      motel lodging on family jaunts, I figured I'd put a few      bucks, and a bit of effort, into building a homemade      camping trailer . . . and still have some money left over      to spend on a trip. The result of my brainstorm is the      "appropriate technology (or APT) camper" pictured here . .      . a lightweight, four-berth tent trailer-built from      both new and used components-which cost me less than      $350!    </p>    <p>      <strong>START AT THE BEGINNING</strong>    </p>    <p>      The heart of my APT Camper is a small, 750-pound-capacity      fishing-boat trailer . . . which I picked up, in good      condition, for $100. These tag-alongs are typically just      under 4 feet wide at the rear and taper inward toward the      front. To ready it for camper carrying, I simply welded two      Lshaped pieces of 4"-broad lightweight channel iron to the      trailer's nose, thus providing a 4-foot-wide structural      base at the front of the tapered frame. Since the chassis      <em>wasn't</em> quite 4 feet wide at the rear, I also had      to weld some 1/8" X 2" X 2" X 3" angle iron brackets to its      side rails in that area to support my trailer's 314" X 4' X      8' plywood floor.    </p>    <p>      After I'd drilled through the brackets and frame members      and bored mounting holes in the wooden platform, I started      work on the camper's walls. To make them, I first trimmed      five 2 X 4's to 8-foot lengths, then cut four 41"-long      sections. Seventeen 2 X 4's-measuring 15-3/4"      each-served as vertical studs.    </p>    <p>      Then, using 1/4" X 3" lag screws, I fastened 13 of the      studs to their respective top and bottom plates, forming      three 19"-tall wall frames . . . which I went on to fasten      to the front and side edges of the plywood floor with bolts      run through the bottom plates, the wooden platform,      <em>and</em> the trailer frame (or the angle iron brackets)      beneath. To enclose the camper's tail end, I framed out two      12 "long walls at the rear corners, bolted them to the base      as I had the others, and then fastened them to the side      walls with lag screws. More screws, placed through the      corner studs at the front, helped to make the entire "box"      secure.    </p>    <p>      I covered the wall frames with 1/4" exterior-grade plywood,      which I fastened to the studs and plates with No. 6 X 1"      wood screws. And finally, I made a 19"-tall, 24 "wide door      of 2 X 2's covered with the ply wood skin and attached the      portal to the walls in the usual manner, with hinges on one      side and a standard lock set on the other.    </p>		<p><strong>WING IT</strong></p>    <p>      In order to provide the camper with bunk space and a      protective lid, I attached two "wings"-made from 4' X      8' sheets of 1/2" plywood-to the top of each long      wall with Thinges. One of the wooden sheets was left full      size, but the other was cut down to 44" wide to allow it to      clear a 2 X 4 spacer I used to mount the <em>first</em>      wing. (This spacer-which I fastened to one wall's top      plate-raises the full section of plywood enough to      let the narrower sheet fold flat beneath it.)    </p>    <p>      Then, to stiffen the sleeping platforms, I glued and      screwed three evenly spaced 2 X 4 ribs across the breadth      of each wing, one near each end and another in the middle,      using No. 6 X 1 " flathead wood screws countersunk into the      plywood's surface.    </p>    <p>      The wooden wings-when extended-are further held      in place by a total of six 3/4" E.M.T. support poles (three      per side) fastened between the ends of the ribs and the      trailer frame. After cutting the rods to about 45" in      length, I flattened one end of each section, drilled a 1/4"      hole through the metal at that point, and locked a 1/4" X      4" machine screw into each opening. Then I bored six 1/4"      holes-each in line with one rib-through the      side of the trailer's chassis, and tightened 1/4" X 2"      bolts into the openings, threaded ends out, using double      nuts. After bending the bolts upward slightly, I slipped      short pieces of 1/4" neoprene hose over the studs to assure      a snug fit.    </p>    <p>      With the support poles on their respective studs, I      temporarily shored up the plywood wings so they were level,      positioned the bolts on the ends of the supports against      the ribs, and drilled horizontal 1/4" holes through the 2 X      4's at the points I'd marked. By slipping the support bars'      bolts through the crosswise bores, I could be sure that      each wing was firmly secured.    </p>    <p>      At this point I had a "winged" camper . . . that would      still tip sideways if someone were to sit on one edge. So,      to solve that problem, I cut two 28" lengths of 1" E.M.T.      and two 30" pieces of 3/4" electrical conduit . . . and      drilled a 1/4" hole through the side of each 1 " section,      about an inch from the end. By securing 3/4" pipe hanger      clamps to the drilled E.M.T. so that the threaded collars      were in line with the bores, I could slide the      smaller-diameter tubes inside the larger ones and hold each      one fast by a bolt (bent at a right angle) tightened      through the clamp to press against the inner conduit      section.    </p>    <p>      To make a foot for each of the telescoping supports, I just      purchased a pair of 1 " E.M.T. to 3/4" pipe couplers and      two 3/4" floor flanges, and fastened them to the bottom of      each pole.    </p>    <p>      Then, to secure the supports at their upper ends (as well      as to provide an attaching point for the exterior tent      poles), I cut two 8" lengths of the channel I'd used to      extend the frame and drilled seven 1/4" holes through each      piece . . . two pairs in line through the part's      shoulders-about 4" apart and toward one end-and      three in a triangular pattern in the base at the opposite      end, as shown in the drawing.    </p>    <p>      By placing the brackets over the ends of the central ribs      and drilling through the shoulder holes and the wood      between them, I was able to slide some 1/4" bolts into the      openings to serve as fastening pins. Likewise, 1/4" X 2"      bolts-secured to the brackets' remaining holes in a      two-up, one-down arrangement and covered with more fuel      line-provided tent pole and support mounts. (The      brackets, poles, and other loose hardware can be stored in      the bed of the camper when not in use.)    </p>    <p>      Several coats of exterior paint, applied to all the wooden      surfaces (both inside and out), protected the camper's skin      and gave it a real quality-built look, too.    </p>		<p><strong>FROM CABIN TENT TO CAMPER</strong></p>		<p>      I found that actually installing the tent was a      simple-and satisfying-task. My 9' X 12'      exterior-frame unit fit the camper just about perfectly,      though I had to cut the canvas floor out to allow access to      the center bunk area. (I used the scrap to stitch up a      snap-in-place weatherproof tarp that protects the trailer      when it's towed.)    </p>    <p>      I merely spread the tent out in place-making sure its      door lined up with the camper's entrance-then worked      around the perimeter, pulling the canvas walls so they hung      over the platform an equal distance all around. By holding      the edges temporarily with C-clamps, I was able to set the      shelter up and secure an inch or two of folded-over canvas      to the underside of the wings, using strips of 1/4" plywood      ripped to 1" widths and held on with 1/2" wood screws.      Then, to attach the tent to the front and back walls, I      simply installed sturdy snap fasteners.    </p>        <p>      Click here to enlarge    </p>    <p>      That's about all there was to it, too. Of course, you may      want to add some extra "goodies" to your own APT Camper,      should you choose to build one (I've included foam mattress      pads, an electrical outlet, and a small cabinet in mine),      but you can get along quite nicely with the simple setup      I've described here. Don't be afraid to improvise, though .      . . if you already have a tent, by all means build your      camper to suit it, even if it's an odd size. There's      nothing like "making do" to save money.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For those who may not feel confident      building their own APT Camper just from the descriptions      given in this article, the author is offering a      construction guide that includes drawings and a materials      list. It's available for $10 from Robert Pentecost, Dept.      TMEN, 1138 Garden Row, Louisville, Kentucky 40213.    </p>    <p>      Check your state's motor vehicle regulations concerning      registration and insurance of a towed camping trailer      before you build.    </p>
