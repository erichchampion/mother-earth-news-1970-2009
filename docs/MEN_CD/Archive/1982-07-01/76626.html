                        <p>      If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us about it in around 500 words (write to THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28791): Be sure to mention when and where you      started your venture and with how much "seed money" ; what      you make (net), and anything else that might be of      <em>assistance to other entrepreneurs. If your story is      used in this column, you'll receive [1] the      satisfaction</em> of <em>knowing that you may help someone      else start a business and [2] a free two-year new or      renewal subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></em> (restricted)    </p>    <p>      For the past five years, after starting with an initial      investment of $1,650, my family and I have been      manufacturing a product called Lufa-Nutra, consisting of a      3-1/2-ounce bar of unscented glycerin soap with a luffa      sponge embedded right in the top. The combination quickly      proved popular with such folks as backpackers and      long-range bicycle travelers.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, as sales increased, we found we couldn't      raise enough luffas to keep up . . . and we couldn't find      enough other growers, either, until "For Luffa or Money!"      (issue 68, page 126) made my dream business a practical      reality. As it happened, you see, I was placing ads in      newspapers trying to locate luffa growers when that piece      appeared, and MOM's article inspired enough people to bring      me plenty of responses. Soon I had all the lufa suppliers I      could possibly use, and the profits from our business      really started rolling in. The net gain for this past year,      in fact, was $20,000 . . . and we're moving the business      from an acre plot to a I 10-acre farm.    </p>    <p>      In case anyone would like to try our product, the current      price for a bar of LufaNutra is $2.50, postpaid, and we'll      ship anywhere in the U.S. Readers ordering more than one      bar can have them for $2.00 apiece plus UPS shipping      charges. To obtain further information-or to get a      wholesale price list-send along a self-addressed,      stamped envelope.    </p>    <p>      Stefania Scoggins<br />      LufaNutra<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      P.O. Box 448<br />      Templeton, Calif. 93465    </p>    <p>      For a long time I'd wanted some extra income . . . but I      knew that second jobs usually demand too many hours for too      little pay. Besides, I needed something I could schedule as      I pleased, not some form of third-shift drudgery. I'm a      carpenter, and pretty handy in lots of ways, but taking on      such side work as home remodeling jobs requires equipment,      insurance, employees, and <em>hassles. I</em> was at a loss      <em>until I</em> started reading the Bootstrap Businesses      column in MOM. At that point I got smart and began to think      small.    </p>    <p>      About that time my brother, who's a real estate agent,      mentioned to me that one of his company's vacant houses had      been broken into. The vandals had kicked in a door, and      there was now no way to lock the house. Well, I volunteered      to go over that day and mend the door. It took three hours      to repair the portal.    </p>    <p>      At my brother's suggestion, I sent a bill to the man who      owned the agency, and soon received reimbursement for the      cost of the materials, plus $45 for labor. Better yet, his      secretary invited me to do similar work for the company on      a regular basis. I got all the repair jobs not only on his      agency's listings, but also on repossessed homes that he      bought for improvement and resale.    </p>    <p>      Well, with all of that going on, I soon had more side work      than I could handle . . . at $15 an hour. And the only      investment I'd made was putting $250 in a separate checking      account to buy materials. That was soon earned back, of      course, and my business is bringing in the extra cash I      need plus the flexibility in hours that's necessary to make      my new enterprise a pleasure.    </p>    <p>      Thanks, MOM, for starting me thinking "small".    </p>    <p>      Steve Wyatt<br />      Dallas, Tex.    </p>    <p>      After reading-in the Bootstrap Businesses column in      MOTHER NO. 49-the letters from two folks who had      started their own typesetting businesses, my husband and I      agreed to establish a similar enterprise of our own . . .      at home. I'd had several years of experience typesetting      for newspapers, and knew that this sort of job could be a      moneymaker, so we signed the purchase papers for an IBM      composer and nervously anticipated the arrival of that      $10,000 machine.    </p>    <p>      However, I then received a call from a local printer who      had typesetting equipment but no typesetter, and he      wondered if I'd be interested in bidding on a major job.    </p>    <p>      Well, that arrangement proved so satisfactory that I      canceled our equipment order and now set type on a      freelance basis. With absolutely no investment, overhead,      <em>or</em> long-term commitment, I can earn anywhere from      $6.00 to $18.00 per hour . . . charging by the job.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, my schedule is very flexible . . . a fact that      makes the business ideal for a working mother. And since      I'm self-employed, I can set up the same business almost      anywhere we might decide to move. It's been the perfect way      to bring in a second income, and I hope another      MOTHER-reading mother can use the idea.    </p>    <p>      Sylvia Fox<br />      Flagstaff, Ariz.    </p>    <p>      Down here in Mexico, bringing in money is a continuous      problem for most people. However, many of the local folks      really know how to make do with less: Barter and      bootstrapping are alive and well south of the border.      And-between my neighbors and MOM-some of that      ingenuity has rubbed off on me.    </p>    <p>      While my husband was attending medical school in Mexico      City, our budget was stretched to the breaking point.      However, when my grandmother passed her well-read      collection of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) along to me and I      happened upon "How to Start a Home Bakery of Your Own"      (issue 37, page 46) . .. I headed straight for the kitchen!      Since I'd already had rave reviews on my granola and whole      wheat loaves, I knew it was time to try to cash in on my      cooking.    </p>    <p>      There's a great demand for American-style health food in      Mexico City, but not a very good supply of such edibles, so      I had an excellent market with little competition. And my      initial investment was only $12.40 . . . which went to      purchase the makings of five kilos of granola and three      loaves of bread.    </p>    <p>      Well, within my first 24 hours in business, I'd sold the      whole batch, and it soon became obvious that word of mouth      was the only advertising I needed to get all the orders I      could handle.    </p>    <p>      To add variety to my line of offerings, though, I bartered      with a friend who sold Mennonite cheese. We traded granola      and cheese, kilo for kilo. And since my cereal cost me only      $2.00 per kilo to make, that was my cost for the cheese as      well.    </p>    <p>      After that, my weekly sales averaged about 15 kilos of      granola at $4.30 a kilo (net profit $34.50), 8 loaves of      bread at $1.50 each (net $5.60), and 4 kilos of cheese at      $4.30 apiece (net $9.20) . . . for a net total of $49.30 a      week. And with the oven on so much, we also kept our      otherwise heatless apartment cozy (and smelling delicious),      while that same warmth more than paid for itself.    </p>    <p>      Muchas gracias, MAMITA!    </p>    <p>      Connie S.
