                <p>      <em>You can "keep your cool" in the heat of summer with      a</em> refreshingly <em>profitable home business!</em>    </p>      <h5 id="byline">by William L. Stewart</h5>  <p>      In 1964, after many years of factory work, my 62-year-old      father retired . . . and immediately began to look for a      way to make some extra money. And, since Dad had once been      a commercial fisherman and crabber, we decided to break out      his long unused nets and try fishing for our fortunes.      However, when we brought our first day's catch home and set      about getting it ready for sale, we suddenly realized      that-because the town's icehouse had closed some      years before-there was no block ice available within      a 20-mile radius!    </p>    <p>      Well, we quickly reasoned that if <em>we</em> couldn't get      ice easily, then neither could anyone else in our      community. Fortunately, Dad and I already had a tiny cement      building that we knew stayed pretty cool-in fact,      we'd used it for cold-storing seafood-so we drove to      the nearest operating icehouse, bought our first pickup      load of frozen blocks, and trucked it back home.      <em>Voila!</em> We were icemen . . . and although our      original plan was to concentrate our efforts on supplying      the area's sport and commercial anglers, we soon learned      that our small operation could also do a brisk business      servicing restaurants, construction projects, factories,      and dozens of other customers that the nearest big-city      companies didn't consider worthwhile to handle.    </p>             <p>      In other words, <em>you're</em> likely to find plenty of      demand for ice, too, no matter where you live in this      country. And you can start a simple delivery      service-that is, you'd be buying ice from a large      commercial plant and selling it, the same- day, to route      customers-with little more than a pickup or trailer,      some plastic holding tubs, a pair of tongs, and a supply of      business cards!    </p>    <p>      I know a man in northern Pennsylvania, in fact, who started      just that sort of shoestring operation several years ago.      By keeping his costs to a minimum (he takes orders in      advance and picks up only the amount of ice he knows he'll      sell during any given day), the fellow has been able to      earn a very good living indeed. Currently, he delivers 70      or so 50-pound containers of ice a day . . . and the three      hours of work required to do that job nets him a hefty $150      to $200 daily!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A BACKYARD ICEHOUSE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although having your own cold-storage facility at home      isn't a requirement for getting started in the ice      business, there <em>are</em> advantages to owning such a      building: It does-for example-allow you to keep      an inventory of your product, and that can cut out a lot of      costly trips to your supplier (plus eliminate a good bit of      loading and unload ing) . . . and with a little effort, you      can build up a good list of regular walk-in customers as      well as (or instead of, if you wish) a delivery route. So      if you have the time and money to devote to the project,      you should seriously consider buying or building a backyard      icehouse.    </p>    <p>      I've found that prefab models, which are usually made of      sheet metal, range in cost from expensive (at least $1,500      for a 6' X 6' unit) to <em>very</em> expensive (up to      $5,000 for a 10' X 10' cooler) . . . and although the price      does include delivery and setup, refrigeration compressors      are extra. What's more, nearly all the readymades I've seen      are designed strictly for interior use-in a grocery      store's stockroom, for instance-so if you don't have      a suitable place to install such a unit, you'd probably      have to add both insulation and exterior weatherproofing      before you could use it outside.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, I honestly believe you'll get more value for      your money by building your own icehouse. And you'll not      only save cash by doing so, but also be able to design,      equip, and insulate the structure as you see fit. In      addition, there's a certain amount of satisfaction in      adding a permanent asset to your business with your own two      hands.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN INSIDE TIP</strong>    </p>    <p>      I can give you the secret of successful icehouse      construction in just two words: <em>Plan ahead.</em> First,      check out your local building and zoning codes, just to be      sure that what you have in mind is legal, and to see      whether you'll be expected to meet any special      requirements.    </p>    <p>      Now, consider three factors before drawing up a set of      plans: the size of the ice blocks produced by your      supplier, the capacity of your truck or trailer, and the      volume of business you anticipate doing (both now and in      the future). These points will help you approximate the      floor space your building should have.    </p>    <p>      For example, our shed is truly tiny . . . only 6' X 7' on      the inside, providing us with a scant 42 square feet of      storage area. We buy our ice in 300-pound blocks that      measure roughly 1' X 2' X 4' each, and we stand them on end      so that each cake occupies only two square feet of floor.      The cooler's total capacity, then, is 21 cakes or      approximately 6,300 pounds.    </p>    <p>      During our first few years-when we were using our      pickup to haul ice-we could fit only seven of those      300-pounders in the truck's bed . . . so we always bought a      full load, never a partial one, and knew that our icehouse      held exactly three trips' worth. Later, however, when our      business began to grow, we bought a stake-body truck that      carries 24 blocks (about 7,200 pounds) . . . which is more      than our little cooler can hold. Therefore, to replenish      our inventory, we must either wait until the stock is      nearly sold out to be able to accommodate close to a full      load, or make frequent (and expensive) half-load trips to      and from the supplier.    </p>    <p>      If our icehouse were just two feet deeper, we could hold an      additional seven blocks . . . and our problems would be      over! You can see, then, just how important it is to plan      before you build. I'd say that-in general-a      small icehouse should hold a minimum of 9,000 pounds and a      maximum of 15,000 . . . which, given the dimensions of the      blocks sold around here, would require roughly 60 to 100      square feet of floor space. (Remember, though, that the      per-unit size and weight of bulk ice in your area may be      different.)    </p>    <p>      While you're still in the planning stages, you may as well      also talk with a heating and cooling contractor about the      possibility of installing a refrigeration compressor in      your icehouse. Now you don't necessarily <em>need</em> that      equipment right away, but you might want to add it as your      operation grows.    </p>    <p>      In our early days, before we bought any cooling apparatus,      we could expect-say-15 blocks of ice to melt to      about three-fourths of their original size within three or      four days. That rate of attrition wasn't      intolerable-in fact, you can expect <em>some      loss</em> even when using refrigeration equipment-but      within a year or so our business had grown to the point      where we could afford to buy a 1-HP conditioner (today's      price for a good-quality unit of the same size, new, would      be about $400 to $600 ... while used models can be had for      about $150 to $175). Later, we switched to two 3/4-HP      conditioners (current prices: $300-$500 new, $100-$150      used) in order to be able to keep one running while the      other was turned off and defrosting. This way, we can      maintain a consistent temperature of 28° to 32°F in      our cooler.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, anticipate such needs before you build, so      that you can at least allow space for whatever equipment      you might eventually install. Remember, too, to give your      icehouse enough inside height to permit easy standing room      . . . but no more (a 6-1/2-foot ceiling is about right in      most cases). Also, plan to install sufficient lighting (one      protected standard bulb is usually enough).    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONSTRUCTION FEATURES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our icehouse is made of concrete block, with one walk-in      entrance and no windows. The 10"-deep, 24"-wide footings      and the 4 "- to 5 "-thick slab floor-which slopes      gradually to a central drain that's connected to drainage      tiles-were poured at the same time. The walls consist      of ten courses of 8 "wide blocks, lined with 3-1/2"-thick      fiberglass batts-installed between 16 "-on-center      studs and covered by 1/4" exterior-grade plywood-over      which we've also applied 1 " rigid-board insulation      <em>and</em> a final sheathing of plywood.    </p>    <p>      If I had it to do all over again, though, I'd insulate the      entire structure more thoroughly . . . by adding material      under the ceiling, inside the walls, and beneath the slab      floor. If the building inspector would allow it, I'd even      bank the outside of the icehouse with earth (after putting      down an appropriate vapor barrier) right up to the roof!    </p>    <p>      In order to make a raised floor that would help us keep our      product well-drained (ice standing in water melts      especially quickly), we placed pressure-treated 2 X 4's on      the cement slab, and then laid a grid of 2 X 6's across      those boards, leaving a 1/4" gap between the slats. (This      arrangement also simplifies the task of cleaning the ice      and the floor.)    </p>    <p>      Our shed has a standard 36" door, to which we've added a      makeshift "sandwich" of insulation (it consists of a layer      of 1 " Styrofoam boards topped with 3" fiberglass batts).      The whole affair is covered with a sheet of white canvas      cut to size and stapled down to protect the inner stuffing.      In addition, we nailed a second panel of similar cloth to      the inside top of the door frame. The fabric hangs loose,      nearly to the floor, and serves as an elementary air lock      when the door is open for long periods.    </p>    <p>      The storage house's roof is of typical shallow-pitch shed      design, constructed of 2 X 6's and covered with tar paper.      If you follow my advice, though, and make your structure      larger than ours, you should probably use more substantial      roofing lumber . . . 2 X 8's at least, or-if the      price is within your budget-2 X 10's or even 2 X      12's. The wider the beams, you see, the more insulation      you'll be able to install, and-despite the higher      initial cost of materials-that will result in bigger      energy savings. In any case, do build your roof carefully!      Ours was plagued by minor leaks, and we eventually had to      cover the entire surface with black tar . . . which soaks      up summer's heat like a solar sponge and, as a result,      increases our cooling costs. (It'd probably be a good idea      to finish your entire structure off with a couple of coats      of good old sun-reflecting white paint!)    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACCESSORIES AND OPTIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're hoping to keep your equipment purchases to a      minimum, you should be able to get by-in the      beginning, at least-with ice picks and tongs . . .      which you can generally obtain at flea markets for just a      few dollars apiece.    </p>    <p>      You'll probably find it useful to place-just outside      your cooler's door-a large sheet of plywood, with      drain holes drilled in it, to keep your product off the      ground while you're loading or unloading. A nearby water      hookup will also come in handy when you have to wash off      ice that's to be used in drinks and water coolers. And a 2      X 4 or 2 X 6 plank, fastened on the outside wall near the      door, can be used (once you've driven some heavy nails part      way into it) to hang tongs and jackets and such.    </p>    <p>      Before too long, you might want to invest in an ice      crusher, too. We purchased our first model for $150 (you      can pay up to $400 or more today) from a fellow who'd      worked in our town's former icehouse. It was adequate for a      while, but later-when clients began calling for      larger quantities-we bought a bigger machine. Our      present contrivance is a plate-steel, electric-motor-driven      affair with heavy metal teeth set in a revolving drum.      It'll munch 50 pounds of ice in about 30 seconds and hasn't      needed a single repair in ten years of hard use. The device      stands on steel legs bolted to a platform made of 1/2"      exterior-grade plywood (again, it's been drilled to permit      drainage) . . . which, in turn, is nailed to large railroad      ties to help keep the assembly stable.    </p>    <p>      We quickly discovered that most people prefer to buy small      quantities of crushed ice already bagged-rather than      bring and fill their own containers-so we sent away      to our local equipment company for some paper ice pouches      in 10- and 25-pound sizes. However, although we did use      these packets for a number of years, they tended to freeze      together, and eventually-for lack of a better      alternative-we switched to plastic sacks . . . which      are slightly more expensive, but less troublesome.    </p>    <p>      In the beginning, Dad and I simply used an old food freezer      to store our packaged ice, but-again, as business got      better-we eventually purchased a bag vendor: one of      the large cooled bins often seen in front of convenience      stores. Thanks to our increased storage capacity, we can do      almost all our crushing and bagging in the evening when the      air is cooler and our surroundings are less hectic.    </p>    <p>      I want to stress once more that such items as crushers and      bag freezers are not at all necessary for starting an ice      service . . . they're improvements that can be added later.      Indeed, because it is possible to begin your business      without the extras, you can take your time shopping around      for good used equipment and probably save a lot of money as      a result.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HAULING AND HANDLING ICE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Anyone who's starting on a bootstrap will probably want to      know how to turn a pickup into an ice truck. Well, the      conversion is easy: Just lay plywood in the bed to prevent      ice from freezing into the grooves . . . and you're ready      to load.    </p>    <p>      The chunks should be placed in the truck on their long,      narrow edges and braced in on the sides with large wooden      blocks (put wedges at the ends, too, if the load doesn't      butt firmly up against the tailgate). This procedure      prevents any ice from sliding and cracking other cakes, and      also keeps the cargo-and the truck itself-more      stable and easier to control.    </p>    <p>      Once everything's in place, always cover the ice with a      tarp and weigh the cover down (with boards or whatever).      The sheet will keep the sun off your frozen merchandise      and-more important-protect the ice from the      melting force of the wind. At first, in fact, regardless of      how carefully you cover the cakes, air coming through      cracks and gaps in the truck body will cut into them. These      spaces can-and should-be closed up, using any      standard sealant or caulking material.    </p>    <p>      By this time you're probably wondering just how, exactly,      an ordinary non-superhuman manages to get a 300-pound block      of cold, slippery ice from ground level to truck bed . . .      or vice versa?    </p>    <p>      Well, we now have the luxury of a hydraulic lift gate for      our big stake-body rig, but when we started out, we simply      manhandled our way through the problem. Our      supplier-who, of course, had heavy-duty loading      equipment-helped us to get the blocks onto our pickup      . . . but taking them off was another matter. During the      first year, we'd simply grab hold of a cake with our tongs,      slide the ponderous bulk on its side to the tailgate,      and-with our fingers crossed and muscles      straining-ease the chunk over the edge and onto a      plywood board.    </p>    <p>      Then, after a summer of sore backs and almost-squished      toes, we finally got smart and built a ramp out of scrap      lumber. The spinesaver took only about an hour to put      together, and made the job of unloading not only easier,      but faster and safer.    </p>    <p>      To build the slide, we first considered the width of our      ice (approximately 12 ") and decided that our ramp would      have to be 14" wide to accommodate any slightly oversized      pieces. We placed two 2 X 6's flat on the ground, parallel      to each other and 14 inches apart at the outside edges      (which left a 3inch gap between the slats . . . all the      better, since less wood in contact with the ice means less      friction and easier sliding). The ends of the planks were      beveled at a pitch of about 1/4 inch . . . with the bevels      on the same side of each board.    </p>    <p>      Then we cut 2 X 4's into 14" lengths and used the pieces as      crossmembers, nailing one of them at right angles to the      parallel 2 X 6's every 15 inches or so, ladderlike.      Finally, 1 X 3's were nailed horizontally along the outside      of the 2 X 6 planks as side rails to prevent ice from      slipping off the ramp.    </p>    <p>      Ordinary butt-type hinges-one for each 2 X      6-were then screwed into one end of the ramp at the      bevels, with the attached side of each hinge countersunk      into the wood and the other side hanging free. If you have      an old-style pickup with a tailgate that'll flop down when      you detach the chains that hold it, you can simply slip the      loose panels of the hinges into the gap between the gate      and the bed, and your ramp will be ready to use. And if you      own a newer-style vehicle with a tailgate that won't drop      fully, it's an easy matter to drill holes in the gate that      align with those in the hinges, and insert bolts to secure      the ramp in place.    </p>    <p>      In either case, with the other end of the slide board      positioned in the doorway of your icehouse, you'll be able      to grab a block with your tongs . . . guide the monolith      down the plank . . . set it up on end . . . and drag it      into the cooler.    </p>    <p>      And, surprisingly enough, the process of setting a cake of      ice up on end or down on its side is relatively easy once      you learn how . . . there's more skill involved than      strength. (My father, at age 80, can unload a truck himself      with very little difficulty.) Unfortunately, the technique      isn't easily <em>described . . . you</em> really have to      see a demonstration, rather than read instructions. My      advice, therefore, is to ask your supplier to show you the      finer points of managing the blocks when you pick up your      first load.    </p>    <p>      Finally-and perhaps most important-always take      great pains to keep your merchandise absolutely clean. In      many areas, ice is legally classified as a food item. But      regardless of whether that's true in your region, you      should be extra careful to keep your product free of dirt      and other contaminants . . . particularly if you're      delivering to restaurants or other places where the ice      will come in direct contact with drinks or edibles! Wash      the blocks thoroughly with water, and transport your orders      in plastic tubs or other vessels that are easy to clean and      won't corrode. The containers must be kept well scrubbed      and stored in a sanitary place when not in use, too . . .      and should never be put to any purpose other than carrying      food-quality ice.    </p>    <p>      You'll also want to make every effort to keep all your      <em>other</em> equipment-such as tongs and      picks-as dirt- and rust-free as possible. We've      always placed a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our      operation. Consequently, we're often complimented on the      clear, clean ice we sell . . . and our good reputation      keeps those customers coming back!    </p>    <p>      Of course, when you're just starting out, you're not going      to be nearly as concerned with promoting return business as      you are with simply <em>getting</em> your first clients . .      . so here are a few tips to help you out.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROSPECTING FOR CUSTOMERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      There's no way around it: You're going to have to get out      there and <em>sell your service.</em> Nobody's going to buy      ice from you if people don't know your company exists, so      hop in your truck and hit the road!    </p>    <p>      First, stop and make a sales pitch at every local diner,      restaurant, factory, bar, and hospital .. . and any      <em>other</em> place in your general driving area where      drinks or water are served. Even businesses that don't      actually need or sell ice themselves, but whose customers      might want the product, should be on your visiting list.      Simply posting small signs in liquor stores and tackle      shops, for example, will often bring in a steady supply of      clients. Area farmers may also need ice for shipping their      produce . . . so you might try placing a small ad in the      local paper or farm journal (a notice at the grange hall or      feed store can work wonders, too). Furthermore, don't      overlook firehouses, churches, and other places where group      socials or cookouts are held during the summer. And county      fairs and carnivals can be important temporary sources of      income, so check them out as well.    </p>    <p>      Any construction site near you might also be worth looking      into. A few years back, for example, a giant shopping mall      was built about 40 miles from here, and the project      employed almost 4,000 workers. An icehouse in the area      brought them 6,000 pounds a day, six days a week, for a      profit of $6,000 a month over the course of the one summer      that work was in progress!    </p>    <p>      Factories can be fruitful places to sell, too. A few years      back a glass plant in our town was plagued by constant      ice-machine breakdowns, so the folks there ended up      ordering from us instead. They never bought less than 2,500      pounds at a time, and they usually needed it three or four      times a week! (Your ice can mean a lot to hardworking      people. One summer, just as we drove up to a factory in our      truck, the employees were walking out on strike because      they didn't have cold drinking water. Everyone was mighty      happy to see us that day . . . in fact, the foreman had his      men unload for us.)    </p>    <p>      If you don't sell every prospect right away, don't be      discouraged. Just keep taking any opportunity to pass out      your business cards or notes stating your hours and phone      number and the various forms of ice (such as block,      crushed, bagged, or cubes) you offer. I suggest that you do      <em>not</em> include specific prices on your cards and      flyers, though. After all, you may need a little bargaining      room when negotiating a potential sale . . . and besides,      inflation can put a printed price schedule out of date      almost overnight.    </p>    <p>      Even though many businesses may turn you down initially,      there's a good chance that you'll hear from at least some      of them sooner or later. For one thing, with the frequency      of icemachine failures in any given summer, you're likely      to get several "emergency" calls before the season is over.      And if those customers receive good service from you, they      may well decide that dealing with your firm is the best way      to go after all.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you can drum up business without making personal      visits. To lure in more customers, we've erected several      signs-handpainted on 3' X 4' sheets of plywood,      giving our phone number and brief directions to our      icehouse-along the major roads leading to our place.      We nailed the placards to fenceposts and telephone poles      (after getting permission from the landowners, of course),      and they've produced a sizable number of orders for us.      Before you put up any boards, though, do check your local      and state laws to see whether such advertising is allowed      or a permit required. (We have to pay the state $2.00 per      sign per year.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRICES AND PROFITS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The prices you charge for your ice should be based on      several factors . . . including your operating costs, of      course, but also taking into consideration such variables      as the distance you have to drive to deliver any given      order, the kinds and quantity of ice purchased, the      frequency of business from each client (certainly a      one-time customer shouldn't get the same low rate as a      regular route buyer) . . . and any special problems      presented by the job (if, for instance, you have to climb      several flights of stairs to make a delivery).    </p>    <p>      In general, we pay our supplier an average of 1-1/2 cents      per pound or $4.50 per cake . . . and charge our customers      between 6 cents and 8 cents a pound. Blocks that are      purchased whole at our icehouse are the <em>least</em>      expensive, of course . . . whereas a delivery of 200 pounds      of crushed ice to a hotel 20 miles away would be charged at      our highest rate.    </p>    <p>      The secret to making a good profit, of course-and to      keeping your retail rates competitive-is to trim your      own <em>purchasing</em> costs as much as possible. Don't be      afraid, then, to dicker a little with your supplier. If you      can, work out a quantity contract to get the best possible      wholesale price. (Incidentally, always be sure to specify      that you want precut, or scored, blocks . . . cakes that      are machine-notched so that you can easily split them into      25- or 50-pound units.) In many cases you can get a better      rate from your dealer by paying cash and by loading your      own truck. Remember, even if you end up paying only a      quarter or so less per cake, you'll come out way ahead over      the months and years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE LAW AND YOU</strong>    </p>    <p>      Every business has to deal, from time to time, with      government agencies . . . and an ice service is no      exception. Before you build your icehouse, or so much as      buy your first load of frozen blocks, take a trip to your      town hall or county seat and check into local and state      ordinances: zoning restrictions, building codes, licensing      requirements, etc. You should also be sure to call your      board of health to find out whether ice is considered a      foodstuff in your area . . . and if so, what measures      you'll have to take to comply with the relevant statutes.    </p>    <p>      Insurance is another important area. Naturally, you'll need      adequate coverage for your truck, and you may also want      some protection against possible litigation ... such as      claims resulting from injuries occurring in your yard or      icehouse. After 13 years of hearing (and worrying about)      increasingly nightmarish lawsuit stories, we've also      purchased a fairly inexpensive product-liability policy      that protects us in case someone claims to have gotten sick      from our ice. We've never <em>had</em> such a      complaint-and chances are we never will-but we      do feel the premium is a small price to pay for our peace      of mind.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FEW FINAL WORDS</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'd be kidding you if I said the ice business is      problem-free (no endeavor is), but I <em>can</em> say that      we have always been able to overcome any obstacles.      Furthermore, we've found the rewards of our efforts to be      well worth the troubles we occasionally face.    </p>    <p>      Running a rural ice service is, after all, clean,      satisfying outdoor work. If you decide to try it, you'll be      selling a good, useful product that-in nearly any      community-is increasingly in demand. You'll also      often be able to keep as cool as you like during a season      when everyone else is complaining of the heat . . . and,      whether you choose to work part or full time, you'll have a      good chance of making a very comfortable living.    </p>    <p>      In other words, when it comes to turning a long hot summer      into cold hard cash, there's no business like the ice      business!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For further useful information, you might      want to read the articles about erecting an old-timey      nonrefrigerated icehouse in MOTHER NOS. 17 (page 20) and 19      (page 30).
