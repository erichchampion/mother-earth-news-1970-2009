                <p>      William and Helga Olkowski are entomologists, founders of      the Farallones Institute, authors of The City People's Book      of Raising Food (Rodale, 1975), and codirectors of the      Center for the Integration of Applied Science (a division      of the John Muir Institute for Environmental Studies, Inc).      Who, then, could be better qualified to offer us some      timely advice about . . .    </p>        <p>      <strong>without Killing Almost Everything Else</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by       Helga and William Olkowski    </h5>		<p>		The article excerpted here first appeared in    Horticulture magazine, June 1976. (Subscriptions: $18 per    year from Horticulture, Subscription Department - TMEN, P.O.    Box 2592, Boulder, Colorado 80321.) Reprinted by permission    of the authors.		</p>    <p>      Without deliberate manipulation by man, insects and other      animal populations are naturally controlled by a variety of      factors. It is necessary to know something about these      natural controls to understand why relying on synthetic      chemical insecticides can have undesirable effects.    </p>    <p>      Weather is a commonly recognized factor. It may become too      hot, too cold, too wet, or too dry for any particular pest      population. Gardeners in every part of the country have      their local examples of what such conditions as a freeze or      a wet spring might mean in terms of problems later in the      year. In California, for instance, the oak moth (      <em>Phryganidia californica</em> ) overwinters as a small      caterpillar upon the leaves of the live oak tree (      <em>Quercus agrifolia</em> ). Normally, heavy rains and      light freezes help to reduce its numbers during the winter      months. But when the season is unusually dry and warm, many      more caterpillars may survive to defoliate the trees when      spring arrives.    </p>    <p>      Food supply is another factor affecting pest populations.      On a farm, large monocultural stands of the same species of      plant may allow a huge buildup of a pest. This is less      likely to be a problem, however, in a small and more highly      diversified home garden.    </p>    <p>      Habitat is also important as a limiting factor for animal      populations. For example, when garden slugs are reproducing      beneath boards that are placed directly on the ground as      walkways in wet weather, by simply placing fine dry sawdust      under the boards you can reduce the slug population while      avoiding the problem of muddy footpaths at the same time.    </p>    <p>      Biological controls, including diseases and natural      enemies, are particularly important in keeping down pest      populations. While most gardeners are aware that toads,      spiders, some birds, and other predators eat insects, it is      not as widely recognized that an insect's major natural      enemies are other insects. The natural enemies can be      broken up into two groups: predators (which usually eat a      lot of their prey at one sitting, and eat many different      species of pests), and parasites (insects which live on, or      inside, another insect, lay eggs inside, and usually cause      the host to die). Examples of predators are ladybird      beetles (Coccinellidae), lacewings (Chrysopidae and      Hemerobiidae), and syrphid (Syrphidae), or hover, flies.      The parasites are so tiny that most people are not aware of      them and they have no common names. Most are members of the      order Hymenoptera and are referred to as miniwasps.    </p>    <p>      The distinctions are important because parasitic insects      are extremely "host specific". For example, the parasite      that attacks the cabbage aphid doesn't attack the rose      aphid. These are the "silver bullets" of pest management,      and learning how to conserve them, import them, and release      them is a very important pest management technique. They're      already out there; in fact, they are the reason you've been      raising anything at all, because without them all your      plants would be devoured by the herbivorous insects. The      cardinal principle of good pest management, therefore, is      to disrupt these natural controls as little as possible, or      you may end up making things worse instead of better.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the injudicious use of synthetic chemical      insecticides may do just that: make the problems worse or      create some where none were before. These results can occur      in several ways.    </p>    <p>      Resurgence is one common effect of an insecticide      treatment: You see some bugs on your plants, you treat them      with a pesticide, and in anywhere from a few days to a      number of weeks later, the same kind of bug is back again,      only this time in higher numbers than before. What      happened? Well, you accidentally killed of the pest's      natural enemies along with the pest. It is rarely possible      to kill off all the pests, and without any predators or      parasites to hold them in check, those that didn't die, or      those that flew in from your neighbor's yard, were able to      multiply without restriction.    </p>    <p>      The pests are plant feeders, or herbivores, and tend to      move around less than their predators, the carnivores. The      predators must actively seek their prey, thus covering more      ground and coming into contact with more of the poison.      Furthermore, there may be a lot fewer predators out there      than pests. Each ladybird beetle must eat a lot of aphids      to survive, so there will only be as many as its food      supply can support. Also, the predators may take longer to      reproduce themselves.    </p>    <p>      Another reason that the natural enemies do not "resurge" as      quickly as the pests, after pesticide treatments, is that      occasionally a material is selectively more toxic to the      predators and parasites. Research shows that this is the      case with carbaryl (marketed as Sevin), which is      particularly poisonous to bees and some other Hymenoptera,      the order which includes parasites of such insects as      aphids, scales, mealybugs, and caterpillars. Thus, as a      consequence of the use of carbaryl, the pest insects may      actually resurge to greater numbers than before.    </p>    <p>      Resistance is a second major effect of exclusive reliance      on synthetic chemical insecticides. Here we are, devilishly      concocting the most exquisite pesticides in our      laboratories, at enormous costs, and somewhere out there,      in every population of pest insects, there is an insect      that is resistant to it. Each time you spray an insect      population, you change the balance between susceptible and      resistant individuals, because all the resistant insects      survive to reproduce, while most of the susceptible insects      are killed. Therefore, the more you use a pesticide to      control insects, the faster you produce a population of      resistant pests.    </p>    <p>      Secondary pest outbreaks are a third problem caused by      injudicious use of insecticides. To understand this you      must remember that there are insects everywhere, on every      plant, that you are not aware of. All the time that you are      focused on and concerned with the highly visible pests,      there are small populations of other insects that could      cause problems if they were not under good control by their      own natural enemies. When you treat the area with an      all-purpose spray, there is a very good chance you will      kill off some of the parasites and predators of these other      potential pests. Then, suddenly, you'll have a whole new      problem on your hands.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN ECOSYSTEM VIEW</strong>    </p>    <p>      All of the above problems are really a result of taking too      narrow an approach to managing insect pests. What is needed      is an overall view that takes into account the entire      ecosystem of which the plant and the insect that feeds upon      it are a part.    </p>    <p>      In general, a garden is an ecosystem of living (biotic) and      nonliving (abiotic) parts. Light, air, water, and minerals      from the soil are converted into living matter by the green      plants, and the plants are fed upon by herbivores, or      plant-eaters. These, in turn, are fed upon by carnivores,      which are fed upon by secondary carnivores, which may fall      prey to tertiary carnivores. The predators and parasites of      insects described above are all part of such a chain. All,      in turn, are fed upon by the detrivores, or decomposers,      the fungi and bacteria which break down biotic materials      and return them to the soil where they become available to      plants once again.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Integrated pest management is a decision-making process      which combines all possible strategies with the aim of      suppressing the population of a pest below the level where      it causes economic or aesthetic damage. The strategies may      be cultural, physical, biological, or chemical. An      essential aspect of this approach is monitoring your garden      to determine what level of pest population is a problem.      This means going out and making counts. You must figure out      how many insects there are per plant, or per leaf or stem,      and then watch to see if their number increases. When the      population is a certain size, and you determine that the      plant damage is intolerable, you should then do something      about the situation. Your goal is really to suppress your      pest population to below that level. We're not talking      about eradication, but pest suppression, which will keep      the ecosystem from oscillating wildly, and will allow it to      cycle at a considerably more moderate level.    </p>    <p>      Examples of some cultural controls are the selection of      varieties resistant to the pest, and management of watering      and fertilizing techniques. Aphids, for example, are very      sensitive to nitrogen levels in the plant. By      overfertilizing you can actually increase their      populations. On the other hand, thrips (order,      Thysanoptera), tiny juice-feeding insects that often look      like straight dark lines approximately 1/16 of an inch      long, may appear in response to dryness. By increasing the      water to the plant, you may reduce the damage that they      cause. We have used this method in managing thrips found on      tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      A common physical means of control is pruning, either to      remove the insects physically, or to remove the favored      habitat of an insect, such as the inner canopy of sucker      growth on a tree, which is favored by certain aphids.    </p>    <p>      Biological control is the manipulation of the biological      components in the ecosystem. This may mean enhancing      natural controls already present, or introducing missing      components that would be desirable. For example, there is a      naturally occurring disease of certain caterpillars called      <em>Bacillus</em> <em>thuringiensis</em> , marketed under      the trade names of Dipel, Thuricide, and Biotrol. If      sprayed on a plant when the caterpillars are large enough      to feed on both sides of the leaf, it will give good      control of the pest without harming any of its natural      enemies.    </p>    <p>      Many people buy carnivores such as ladybird beetles or      praying mantids to release in their gardens as general      predators. However, if not previously defatted, the      ladybird beetles must fly to burn off stored body fat      before feeding, so they will shortly leave the area in      which they are released. Mantids are very unselective in      what they eat and are probably better bought for purposes      of observing and learning about insects than in hopes that      they will satisfactorily control pest populations.    </p>    <p>      Green lacewings, excellent general predators, can also be      bought commercially. Because they are shipped and released      in the egg stage and hatch into voracious larvae that      cannot fly, lacewings are useful biological control tools.      Unfortunately, they are not yet produced commercially in      many sections of the nation. The only large-scale insectary      we know that offers them for sale by mail is Rincon-Vitova      Insectaries, Inc., P.O. Box 95, Oakview, California 93022.      Wheast, a food spray that is a by-product of the cheese      industry, can be used to feed and enhance the numbers of      lacewings and some other common predators found in the      garden. It can be obtained from the same company.    </p>    <p>      Chemical tools are also part of an integrated pest      management system, but they are used only as a last resort,      when all other methods have failed and the damage is      intolerable. They are used only where needed and carefully      timed so as to cause the least disturbance of the natural      controls. The most selective chemicals are chosen, to      affect the pest but as few other organisms as possible. And      they are applied very infrequently, so they will work when      you need them and will not cause new problems. Used in      reduced quantities, they will be less likely to pose      hazards to the environment and human health.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong>    </p>    <p>      [1] Start by overcoming some of your fear of insects. They      are part of the natural world (indeed there may be more      insect species than any other form of life), and few are      any problem to man. Forget the concepts of "good" bug and      "bad" bug used to sell you products you don't need. Even      the plantfeeding insects are necessary. Those that eat the      weeds help to keep them in check, and the ones that feed on      cultivated plants are important too. You will never      eliminate (and do not want to eliminate) the pest insects,      because you have to have the pest insects around in order      to keep around the natural enemies that control them.      That's why there's no such thing as a "bad" bug-there      should even be some of the "worst" pests around to make      sure you have the predators and parasites around so that      the next "bad" bug will have enough enemies there to feed      upon it.    </p>    <p>      [2] When you see plant damage, ask yourself, is it      tolerable? There is no way to have plants without the      insects that feed on them, and there is, therefore, no way      to have no insects. We have to readjust our values to      tolerate some plant damage.    </p>    <p>      [3] When the damage involved is truly intolerable, then you      need to determine the true cause. It is easy to blame an      insect or other animal that is highly visible during the      day (such as an earwig or cutworm curled up inside a hole      in a tomato) while the real culprit is something else that      does its damage by night. In fact, going out after dark      with a flashlight may be the only way to discover what is      going on. (On the tomatoes in our garden, for example,      slugs were eating holes at night that provided refuge for      the insects during the day.)    </p>    <p>      [4] When you have correctly identified the animal causing      the problem, learn something about its habits and life      cycle. You can do this through direct observation, reading,      or asking your local university or county agricultural      extension advisor. He or she also may be the best person to      help you identify the animal that you have found.    </p>    <p>      [5] Knowing something about the pest, you can start to      consider how you can modify the environment to affect it.      For example, in our back yard we were severely bothered by      an invading garden snail ( <em>Helix aspersa</em> ). By      looking around, we discovered we had actually created some      choice breeding areas for the snails in a large bed of      succulents and under boards used for pathways, where we      discovered a great many baby snails and snail eggs. So we      reduced the large bed to a few specimen plants, separated      so that air could circulate around them and dry them of      after rains or watering, and we put dry sawdust under the      boards. This helped to reduce the snail population almost      immediately.    </p>    <p>      [6] Use handpicking. To continue with our snail example, we      made a point of checking the garden for snails in the early      evening with a flashlight every week or so. Those we found      in the vegetable beds were collected by hand and fed to our      chickens. (We could also have stepped on them and put them      in the compost pile.)    </p>    <p>      [7] Try barriers. Isolating beds with dry sawdust can      reduce snail and slug traffic between beds. Tin cans,      opened at both ends and shoved down into the mulch a few      inches to provide a collar around freshly transplanted      seedlings, have proved effective against the same pests.      Nets and chicken wire are protection against birds in early      spring. Cages made of aluminum flyscreen will keep out the      cabbage maggot and other root burrowing larvae of flies. Be      inventive!    </p>    <p>      [8] Concoct some ingenious traps. We turned over clay      flowerpots set among the plants to collect snails that      wander in during the warm, sunny day and emerge to feed at      night. Rolled up newspapers give earwigs places to hide.      Flytraps can be simply constructed and baited with dog      manure or garbage.    </p>    <p>      [9] Provide habitat and food for beneficial organisms that      are the natural enemies of insect pests. Compost mulches      favor the shiny black carabid beetles (Carabidae) that eat      cutworms, for example. By increasing the diversity of the      soil surface, you increase the habitat for beneficial      insects, particularly some of the predacious ground      beetles.    </p>    <p>      Plant flowers in the vegetable garden, particularly      shallow-throated ones that provide easy access for the      little mini-wasp parasites mentioned above. Many of the      beneficial insects need some pollen and nectar during the      season to provide protein for egg laying. So having some      plants in flower all during the season may actually help to      suppress the potential pest populations. This is an example      of companion planting that works!    </p>    <p>      [10] Modify your cultural methods. Make efforts to      determine whether your watering, fertilizing, and pruning      or clipping methods are affecting the pest populations. One      strategy for dealing with pests is overhead sprinkling,      which we recommend, or direct water sprays, taking the hose      and washing off a plant that has an insect on it. Not only      do you have direct effects (the physical effects of the      water hitting the plant, knocking off the insect, or      breaking its tissues or mouth parts), but also you will      increase the humidity levels of the plant or plant tissues,      and this could produce fungal outbreaks in the insect      populations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO CHOOSE A PESTICIDE</strong>    </p>        <p>      When you've tried everything and nothing seems to work      adequately, you need to stop and ask yourself if the plant      in question is important enough to you to warrant      supporting it with a chemical crutch. It may simply be the      wrong variety or species for that spot. Your overall      climate, or the miniclimate, may be unsuitable for that      plant.    </p>    <p>      If you decide that you wish to keep the plant, then you may      wish to resort to the use of a chemical tool. Here are some      guidelines for choosing and using them.    </p>    <p>      [I] Pick a pesticide that is least toxic to mammals. Of      course, water and water-and-soap sprays are relatively      harmless from that point of view. Some detergents even have      phosphorus in them, which is a plant nutrient. However,      when using a commercial detergent compound, always test it      on a small portion of the plant first, since you don't know      what other chemicals might be in the material. Such an      approach is also useful with other pesticides.    </p>    <p>      Toxicity of pesticides is measured by LD 50 , or the lethal      dose required to kill 50% of the test animals, usually mice      or rats. The LD 50 is expressed in milligrams per kilogram      of body weight of the test animal, either dermal (when      contact is through the skin) or oral (through eating). The      higher the number, the less toxic the dose. Thus pyrethrin      with an LD 50 of 3,000 is assumed to be less toxic than      rotenone with an LD 50 of 400, or diazinon with an LD 50 of      108. In some commercial greenhouses where constant use of      pesticides against whiteflies has produced populations      resistant to everything else, some growers now use a      material called Temik with an LD 50 of 0.93. This is so      toxic that a drop accidentally spilled on a sweaty hand      could kill a person.    </p>    <p>      If you wish to use a product and are curious about its      toxicity, you can usually find the LD 50 of any      commercially available compound by looking it up in a      reference work such as "Commercial and Experimental Organic      Insecticides" from the Bulletin of the Entomological      Society of America, 15 (2): 85-148, often available in      libraries or agricultural extension offices.    </p>    <p>      However, it is important to remember that the LD50 doesn't      tell you everything. Materials are not tested in      combination, so it will tell you nothing about synergistic,      or combined, effects with the other contaminants in the      environment to which you may be exposing yourself. Also,      the tests are ended and summarized after a short period of      time, and the effects may take longer to show up. This was      the problem with Kepone, which was thought to be safer than      it turned out to be. This is also the problem with      materials such as chlordane and DDT, which are now      suspected of causing cancer many years (usually 20 to 25)      after exposure, but which were originally regarded as      relatively nontoxic to humans.    </p>    <p>      [2] Pick the most species-specific material available. This      is the advantage of <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> ,      mentioned earlier. It is very selective, affecting only      certain caterpillar pests and not their natural enemies.    </p>    <p>      [3] Choose pesticides that break down quickly to harmless      materials. All of the botanicals, as they are      called-pyrethrin, rotenone, and sabadilla are      examples-break down rapidly under sunlight and      bacterial action, and their breakdown products are      nontoxic.    </p>    <p>      [4] Spot treat. Use only as much as you really need where      you need it, confined to the problem area. Use a bait, if      one is available, before resorting to a broadcast      treatment.    </p>    <p>      [5] Time your treatments. Don't spray just as the pest      population is beginning to decline because large numbers of      their natural enemies are present. Give the parasites and      predators time to catch up; they always lag somewhat behind      their prey. Learn to recognize the common insect predators      and parasites of your area so you'll be able to see how      well they are doing.    </p>    <p>      This whole approach to insect management is hardly simple.      But it is worth it to keep yourself healthy, your garden      thriving, and the insect populations, both plant and insect      feeders, in balance with one another. This balance may      ultimately be essential if we want to be able to continue      growing plants at all.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: In order to help you identify, and thus      decide how to control, your garden's pests, we've included      a guide to some of the more common vegetable-eating insects      on pages 94 and 95.    </p>
