                    <h5 id="byline">by      Tom Ferguson, M.D.    </h5>   <p>      <em>This issue's column is an edited version of a      discussion I had recently with Dr. Emmett Miller. Emmett's      a tall, graceful man with a ready laugh and a soothing      voice. But those aren't the only rea</em> <em>sons, as      you'll soon realize when you read his practical advice, why      Dr. Miller's series of self-care cassette recordings is so      popular, or why his practice in Menlo Park,      California-where he specializes in psychosomatic      medicine, hypnotherapy, performance optimization, and      stress management-is so busy.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Dr. Miller, how can people use      cassette tapes as self-care tools?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Oh, there are several ways.      Relaxation tapes of various kinds, for example, can be very      effective in reducing stress levels. But I've found an even      more profound way to use cassettes as aids in making      long-term, <em>self-directed</em> changes in health habits.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Could they, for instance, help      an individual stop smoking?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Sure . . . or control his or her      temper, or eat more sensibly, or correct any number of      other undesirable behavior patterns.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Don't all of those uses pretty      much parallel the services that you provide for your      private clients?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Yes. In fact, the idea for      producing our cassettes sprang from my practice of      recording initial sessions with patients. I'd attempt to      guide the person into a deeply relaxed state and then lead      him or her through a specific five-stage thought process      that I've found helps promote behavior change. Afterward,      I'd give the tape of the session to my patient to play at      home. More often than not I'd find out later that, after      successfully using the recording to break a particular      habit pattern, the person had passed the tape on to a      friend . . . who, in turn, had used it-with minor      modifications to my instructions-to deal with a      completely different problem. This discovery led me to      realize that I could probably make a general kind of tape,      based on the same deep-relaxation principles I applied in      private practice, which people could use to change any of a      whole range of health habits.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> I wonder if you could elaborate      a bit more on the five-stage thought process you mentioned.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Certainly. Let's invent four      fictitious people with varying self-care concerns, and then      guide each of them through all the steps. Jerry, for one,      wants to stop smoking . . . Ella hopes to lose weight . . .      Betty would like to undertake a regular exercise program .      . . and Linda-a nurse who works in an emergency      room-feels the need to be more assertive in her      professional relationship with doctors.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> OK, so the initial step would      be... ?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Well, first, each of those people      needs to learn how to go into a deeply relaxed state.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Is that the same as being      hypnotized?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Yes, pretty much . . . each is a      state of tranquil attentiveness. And the ability to achieve      such a level of consciousness is a skill that's fairly easy      to acquire . . . but most adults do need to learn it.      Youngsters, on the other hand, can often pick it up almost      immediately. The trick to this kind of relaxation is to let      go of the critical, analytical aspect of your mind and      allow a very childlike, trusting part to emerge.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> And your tapes actually help      people do this?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Well yes, either mine or several      other commercially produced recordings that are currently      on the market will do that. However, a person could simply      use a book on self-hypnosis and accomplish the same thing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> All right. So the first step is      deep relaxation. Then what?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Step Two is to picture yourself      the way you really want to be . . . and to do so in as much      detail as possible. Jerry might see himself as a healthy      nonsmoker with pleasant breath, clean lungs, more stamina,      and fewer colds and sore throats. Ella could envision      herself, slim and trim, out shopping for a new wardrobe.      Perhaps Betty would imagine jogging in the park on her way      home from work . . . and Linda might visualize herself      calmly stating her opinions to a group of attentive,      respectful physicians.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> I can see how picturing the kind      of person you'd like to be <em>might</em> help reinforce      that desire.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Well, it gives you an opportunity,      at least, to examine what your life could be like. And that      brings me to Step Three, which is often especially      important: While still in a relaxed state, the patient      should seriously question whether he or she is <em>really      ready</em> to give up the to-be-changed behavior.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> In other words-when push      comes to shove-some people aren't truly prepared to      make the necessary sacrifices?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Exactly . . . and that's perfectly      understandable. Every habitual behavior pattern, even one      that seems to be completely without purpose, provides us      with something we want or <em>think</em> we want. Perhaps      smoking gives Jerry a way to vent his nervous energy, for      example. Being overweight may protect Emma from having to      cope with men who might otherwise be sexually attracted to      her. Linda's reluctance to speak her mind could be her way      of avoiding having to deal with any resentment that might      arise if she <em>were</em> more assertive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> And if a person discovers that      he or she does have serious reservations about wanting to      make a change?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> That individual should pay      attention to those reservations. If the doubts are strong,      the person should be thankful <em>not</em> to be trying to      give up a habit that-at the moment-he or she is      not really ready to do without.    </p>    <p>      Let's say Jerry and Linda and Betty feel clearly committed      to making a change . . . but Ella feels such inner      resistance that she realizes her real problem isn't      overeating so much as feeling insecure with her sensuality.      Perhaps, as a result of this revelation, she'll decide to      focus her efforts on understanding her sexual self. Maybe      she'll do some reading on the subject, or join a woman's      support group.    </p>    <p>      Also, a patient will often find it possible-although      he or she isn't comfortable giving up all of a certain      behavior pattern-to make at least a partial      trade-off. For example, Ella might decide that while she's      exploring these other issues, she's willing to cut down on      <em>some</em> of her binge eating. Then, in another few      weeks, she may well be ready to modify her habits even      more.    </p>    <p>      And you must recognize that such a course of action      wouldn't be in any way a failure for Ella . . . in fact,      it'd be quite the opposite. For many people it's in this      third stage, exploring resistance to change and getting in      touch with their true feelings, that the real breakthroughs      occur.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> But once a person <em>has</em>      made a commitment . . . what then?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Step Four is next. The individual      envisions challenges to the newly chosen behavior . . . and      imagines meeting those trials head-on. Jerry, for example,      might picture a friend offering him a cigarette . . . Linda      might see a physician making unreasonable demands on her .      . . and Betty might conjure up a scenario in which she's      asked out for a drink after work, when she was planning to      jog.    </p>    <p>      In each instance, the person rehearses an appropriate      response: Jerry says "no thanks", Linda stands up for      herself, and Betty takes a rain check and goes for her      usual run.    </p>    <p>      In fact, this mental playacting is really just a warm-up      for Step Five. At the end of each day the patient looks      back over the previous 24 hours and reviews all the      <em>real</em> challenges that presented themselves. If he      or she would've liked to respond differently to a given      situation, then that person <em>imagines</em> doing so. On      the other hand, if the individual reacted in the way he or      she wanted to, it's time to celebrate that success. In this      way any response-whether it's true to the goals at      hand or not-serves to <em>encourage pos</em> itive      behavior.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> And this five-stage process      works?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Definitely. I use the same basic      technique in most of my clinical work, and usually see at      least a start toward good results within the first couple      of weeks. And I incorporate the same process in the tapes      we produce and sell.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> And the cassettes are just as      effective as a series of personal visits might be?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> Well, let me put it this way. For      years I tried to quit smoking . . . and then I produced a      two-tape set, called <em>Smoke No More.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> And you're a nonsmoker now?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILLER:</strong> You guessed it.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The series of self-care cassette recordings      produced by Dr. Emmett Miller features a diversity of      titles, including Rainbow Butterfly (a meditation tape with      harp music) . . .
