                    <h5 id="byline">      by BOB ARNOLD    </h5>    <p>      <em>Men judge by the complexion of the sky<br />      The state and inclination of the day . . .</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>RICHARD II, ACT 2</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the fact of<br />      the sky; but can ye not discern the signs<br />      of the times?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>MATTHEW, 16</em>    </p>    <p>      When you're into farming it seems like all you do is wait      for it to rain or wait for it to stop . . . and even if      you're city-bound, a lot of what you do depends on the      weather. While some folks argue that we ought to take      pleasure in whatever the climate brings, there are times      when its nice to know in advance what ol' Mother Nature has      in store for tomorrow or next Wednesday . . . and that can      be arranged quite easily once you know the secrets of      down-home weather forecasting.    </p>    <p>      To an extent, you know, we're all weather forecasters      already. If the clouds are dark and heavy and the wind      feels and smells a certain way, we assume its going to      rain. And it usually does. Complete, accurate weather      projections are just an extension of this. We observe and      we draw conclusions from our observations.    </p>    <p>      Here, then, are some bits and pieces of scientific      information, weather lore and personal observation to help      you to know what to look for and what conclusions to draw.      With a little practice you'll find that you, too, can      become just about as accurate as the official weather      forecaster on whom you probably now rely. It'll be one more      apron string that you can let go of . . . and one more step      toward independence.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE WEATHER COMES FROM</strong>    </p>    <p>      The first thing you'll need to know is a little about how      weather works and the bare essentials can be explained      quite simply: everything is caused by air masses.      Meteorologists would probably recoil in horror at that      simplification, but there it is.<br />      <br />      These air masses are great lumps of atmosphere with fairly      uniform temperature and moisture characteristics. They form      over certain areas of the earth's surface (known as source      regions), acquiring the temperature and moisture      characteristics of the parent region in the process. These      huge chunks of air are classified by temperature and      moisture and named for the source area over which they form      (Fig. 1).    </p>    <p>      There are four basic types of air masses: Warm and Dry      (Tropical Continental, indicated by the symbol cT); Warm      and Wet (Tropical Maritime, mT); Cold and Wet (Polar      Maritime, mP); Cold and Dry (Polar Continental, cP). The      maritime air masses (those originating over the ocean) are      sometimes subdivided and given names such as Gulf Tropical,      Atlantic Tropical, Atlantic Polar, Pacific Tropical and      Pacific Polar . . . all with appropriate symbols. The names      really aren't very important though, just the      characteristics.    </p>    <p>      Now these monster globs of air hang around their source      regions awhile, then-for reasons that no one seems to      entirely understand-they break loose and go rolling      across the surface of the planet in fairly regular      patterns. During this migration they sometimes overrun,      push into and otherwise collide with other great chunks of      atmosphere of the same or sharply differing      characteristics.    </p>    <p>      The edges of the air masses are called fronts and the edge      of another is called a frontal zone (or frunnelzone, as      they say on the six o'clock news). It's along these frontal      zones that most storms and atmospheric changes occur.    </p>    <p>      Alright. We now know that gigantic hunks of air form, move      across and collide on the earth's surface . . . and we have      a name for that activity. We call it weather. It stands to      reason, then, that all you have to do to forecast the      <em>weather</em> is to learn to tell which air masses are      where and the probable direction and speed in which they're      headed.    </p>    <p>      I might mention, in passing, that the Polar Continental      (cP)-a great, cold, dry air mass that forms over the      interior of central Canada-is the major influence in      the weather for all the central and eastern United States.      Psych that one out and you've gone a long way toward      predicting the climate for half the country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WEATHER DIARY</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the handiest and most basic (also one of the most      overlooked) weather forecasting tools of all is a daily      weather diary. Each day, make notes on the wind direction      and speed, temperature, humidity and precipitation, cloud      cover and all other weather signs and-after a month      or so-you'll begin to notice and understand the exact      conditions in your locality that exert certain influences      over following weather.    </p>    <p>      Remember that-no matter what an overall forecast      might be-each little local area has peculiarities all      its own. Until you're familiar with the quirks of your      particular locality, your weather predictions are apt to be      just so-so. Once you've become acquainted with the      real climatic character of your region, however, the      accuracy of your forecasts is certain to take a healthy      jump upward.    </p>    <p>      There's another point in favor of the diary: once in a      while the weather becomes so uncertain that, as the      oldtimers say, "All signs fail". When that happens, you can      sometimes still make a better-than-average forecast by      going back over your diary and looking for similar      conditions. Weather has a way of repeating itself pretty      consistantly.    </p>        <p>      <strong>RAW MATERIALS FOR THE DIARY AND FORECAST</strong>    </p>    <p>      Weather changes are almost always preceded by changes in      temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind      direction, cloud formations or by combinations of such      events. These are the signs we must learn to observe and      evaluate and, since some of the changes in these signs are      too subtle to be directly sensed and accurately judged by      most of us mere humans, we've got to rely on certain      measuring devices.    </p>    <p>      These devices can be natural (like birds, insects, animals      and plants) or mechanical (thermometers, barometers,      anemometers and such). People who use one type of indicator      sometimes scorn those who use the other but the folks who      really know what the weather's going to be use a little of      both.    </p>        <p>      <strong>MECHANICAL DEVICES</strong>    </p>    <p>      While it's possible to learn to judge temperature and      barometric pressure pretty accurately by natural signs      alone, a thermometer and a barometer are very handy and      inexpensive to obtain. Come to think of it, outside of a      weather vane and one or two other instruments you can make      at home, a thermometer and a barometer are about the only      store-bought or man-made weather detectors that are really      essential.    </p>    <p>      Of course-if you're into a heavy science and      technology thing, have a fetish for dials and knobs and      money's no object-you can purchase all manner of      measuring devices which have remote sensors connected to      big, official-looking dials. Mounted on the wall of your      den or study, these dials will give you constant readings      of wind direction, wind speed, barometric pressure,      temperature and most anything else you want to know. You      can even get instruments that chart continuous graphs on      strips of paper and make your friends very nervous . . .      and you can set up your own complete weather station for      about $600.00. Personally, however, I don't feel that such      elaborate rigs are necessary.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>NATURAL SIGNS AND PORTENTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The first thing to consider when brewing up a home-grown      weather forecast is wind direction and strength. The wind      direction, incidentally, is named for the direction      <em>from which the wind is coming</em> . One that blows      from west to east is a westerly wind. This may seem a bit      obvious to some, but I always have trouble remembering it.      A good, free-swinging weather vane is handy, easy to build      and mandatory if you have a barn roof without one.    </p>    <p>      In the United States, the prevailing wind is westerly. In      the summer, it's frequently southwesterly and in the      winter, northwesterly . . . but, nevertheless, westerly.    </p>    <p>      A prevailing wind indicates fair weather and a      non-prevailing wind (one that comes from another direction)      signals the approach of a storm, due to the      counter-clockwise circulation of winds around a low      pressure-or storm center-area.    </p>    <p>      As a storm center approaches, you'll notice the wind begin      to change from westerly to southwesterly to southerly. This      is called a <em>backing wind</em> . When the low pressure      air mass is directly over you, the winds will continue to      change (this time to northerly or easterly, depending on      where you are in relation to the storm) and these are      called <em>veering winds</em> . And as the center continues      eastward past you, the winds return to their prevailing      westerly direction.    </p>    <p>      All storms in the northern hemisphere revolve      counter-clockwise around a central low pressure area this      way so-if you face into the wind and point to your      right-you'll always be pointing toward the nearest      storm center or low pressure area.    </p>    <p>      This wind activity is neatly summed up in an old weather      proverb:    </p>    <p>      <em>When the wind is in the south,<br />      The rain is in its mouth.<br />      When the wind is in the east,<br />      It's neither good for man nor beast.<br />      The wind in the west<br />      Suits everyone best.</em>    </p>    <p>      By the way, the backing winds mentioned above frequently      cause the leaves of trees to curl and show their undersides      . . . so, when the oldtimers say they can look at a tree      and see a storm approaching, they're not joshing. Now that      you know the secret, you can predict heavy weather the same      way. Atmospheric pressure is another good indicator of      weather activity. Simply knowing the atmospheric pressure      (also called the barometric pressure) at any given moment,      however, is about as useful as knowing the time on a      stopped clock. Unless you know what the pressure has been      over a period of time, whether it's been rising or falling      and if its action has been fast, slow, regular or erratic .      . . you really can't use atmospheric pressure to predict      anything.    </p>        <p>      To use a barometer (the standard instrument for measuring      atmospheric pressure) most effectively, then, we should      note its reading every hour or so. Better      yet-according to those who love to play with      gadgets-is a recording barometer that traces every      little change on a graph. Most of us, though, find it quite      sufficient to have a simple little $1.98 barometer hung on      the back porch for a quick glance first thing in the      morning, last thing at night and as we come in from the      fields for our mid-day meal.    </p>        <p>      There are a good many natural signs that indicate changes      in atmospheric pressure, too. Some are quite obvious and      others are pretty subtle. For instance-due to the      drop in pressure that preceeds rain or a storm-birds      and animals become restless, uneasy, more active and noisy.      Flying insects swarm and seem more numerous and annoying.      Smoke rises slowly and may even droop slightly. Bees stay      closer to the hive. Swallows and bats fly very low. Ants      get unusually busy and scurry about moving their eggs from      place to place. Sound travels much further during a low and      smells seem much stronger as the lesser atmospheric      pressure allows the earth to release more of its odors.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sound</em> <em>traveling far and wide.<br />      A stormy day will betide.</em>    </p>        <p>      When the atmospheric pressure rises-particularly if      the increase is the result of a great polar continental      high out of Canada-the stale smell in swamps and      ditches will diminish, giving the air a fresh (almost      neutral) smell. Smoke rises straight up to great heights      and birds fly high. Fish become more active and swim nearer      the surface (it's a good time to go fishing). During the      winter, the ice on frozen ponds and lakes will begin to      crack and boom during periods of rising pressure. People      seem happier and friendlier also and, if you've got      business to do or something to sell, this is the time to do      it. Many other natural weather signs are activated by      changes in atmospheric pressure. For instance, rain is      indicated by the flowers of the chickweed if they're closed      in the morning; if they're open, the day will be fair. Some      forecasters state that gentianella and pimpernel give the      same predictions but, since I've never seen either plant, I      can't confirm it. I do know that old houses, old furniture      and old people will creak and groan with a pressure change      either way.    </p>        <p>      Clouds can generally be relied upon to tell you what sort      of air mass surrounds you and what kind of air mass is on      the way (see Figure 8) . . . and the two cloud types most      useful for predicting the weather are cumulus and stratus.      Various clouds of the cumulus family are associated with      cold air masses or cold fronts (see Figure 5) and usually      indicate the possibility of short, hard rains followed soon      by clear skies and fair weather. The higher the cumulus      clouds behind the front, the longer and drier the clear      spell will be.    </p>        <p>      CIRRUS: Very wispy, feathery clouds which form at great      heights. Due to this height, cirrus are the first clouds to      color before sunrise and the last to darken at sunset.    </p>    <p>      CIRROSTRATUS: Veil the sky with the thin, overall whitish      haze which produces a halo around the sun or moon.      Cirrostratus clouds with wispy, defined edges are often      called "mares tails".    </p>    <p>      CIRROCUMULUS: Resemble cirrus clouds but are sort of tufted      or rippled like sand on a beach. Cirrocumulus are clouds of      the "mackerel sky".    </p>    <p>      ALTOSTRATUS: Similar to cirrostratus, but more dense. This      denseness causes the soft-edged corona around the sun or      moon.    </p>    <p>      ALTOCUMULUS: One form of altocumulus, called "sheep backs",      looks like a layer of cotton balls and a second form has      the appearance of long rolls or bands of cotton bunched      together. The regular, parallel bands of the second form      are easily distinguished from the "mackerel sky"      cirrocumulus.    </p>    <p>      CUMULUS: The beautiful, fluffy, white puffs that scatter      over a fair weather sky.    </p>    <p>      STRATOCUMULUS: These long, flattened puffs are what good      little cumulus clouds turn into by the end of the day.    </p>    <p>      NIMBOSTRATUS: Ragged scud or rain clouds which form beneath      altostratus and lower as the rain begins.    </p>    <p>      STRATUS: Very low, horizontal, layer clouds that seem dense      and thick. Undersides are frequently greyish. If these      forms are broken into fragments or shreds, they're called      fractostratus . . . which is a nice word.    </p>    <p>      CUMULONIMBUS: With flattened and horizontal bases and tops      that pile up to great heights, these "thunderheads" are a      fairly sure sign of rain, thunder and lightning. Because of      their height, the tops of cumulonimbus clouds can be seen      from many miles away . . . long before their bases are      visible.    </p>    <p>      Stratus clouds of one kind or another generally accompany      masses of warm air and warm fronts (see Figure 6) and are      signs of long, steady, gentle rains and skies that will      stay grey and cloudy until the next cold air mass comes      along. These warm fronts can be accurately predicted 12 to      16 hours in advance by a halo around the sun or moon. If      the sun or moon simply looks fuzzy, the front will arrive      in about 8 or 10 hours. The following two proverbs deal      with this phenomena:    </p>    <p>      <em>"The moon with a circle brings water in</em> <em><br />      her back "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"If the moon shows a silver shield,<br />      be not afraid to reap your field:<br />      But if she rises haloed round,<br />      soon we'll tread on deluged ground. "</em>    </p>    <p>      There are many other proverbs, maxims, precepts and sayings      that have to do with warm and cold fronts and the clouds      that accompany them. Most of these dictums add little to      the previous explanation but they do serve as a useful      shorthand method of remembering valuable weather lore. As      an example, the thin and wispy cirrus clouds that precede      the long rains of a warm front are immortalized thusly:    </p>    <p>      <em>Mackerel sky and mares' tails<br />      Make tall ships lower their sails.</em>    </p>    <p>      We're reminded that warm fronts give an early warning of      their long rains while the short, lurid thunderstorms of a      cold front build rapidly by:    </p>    <p>      <em>Rain long foretold, long last,<br />      Short notice, soon past.</em>    </p>    <p>      As night cloudiness increases before a rain, some stars      become hidden while patches of others remain visible. This      phenomenon has inspired:    </p>    <p>      <em>When the stars begin to huddle.<br />      The earth will soon become a-puddle.</em>    </p>    <p>      Accurate predictions of eight frosts are often quite      important during the spring and fall. Such frosts are more      likely to occur when there's no cloud cover to help blanket      and hold the earth's nocturnal heat radiation as we're      reminded by:    </p>    <p>      <em>Clear moon, frost soon.</em>    </p>    <p>      In warmer weather, dew-rather than frost-is      formed on cloudless nights. Dew in the morning, therefore,      is an indication of fair weather to follow:    </p>    <p>      <em>When the grass is dry at morning light,<br />      Look for rain before the night,<br />      When the dew is on the grass,<br />      R</em> <em>ain will never come to pass.</em>    </p>    <p>      and    </p>    <p>      <em>When the morn is dry, the rain is nigh;<br />      When tire morn is wet, no rain you'll get</em>    </p>    <p>      Sky colors and such aren't much noted by meteorologists but      they can sometimes be good signs on which to base weather      predictions . . . as one of the most consistantly accurate      proverbs illustrates:    </p>    <p>      <em>Red sky in the morning<br />      Is a sailor's sure warning:<br />      Red sky at night<br />      Is the sailor's delight.</em>    </p>    <p>      or    </p>    <p>      <em>Evening red and morning gray<br />      sets the traveler on his way:<br />      Evening gray and morning reel<br />      Brings the mitt down on his head.</em>    </p>    <p>      Rainbows can also be pretty reliable forecasting tools.      Since you can see a rainbow only by looking toward rain      with the sun at your back, it's quite evident-with      the sun always in the east in the morning-that any      rainbow you observe in the forenoon must be to the west.      There's a good chance that the prevailing movement of air      masses will bring that rain toward you. Conversely, a      rainbow in the evening marks rain that is probably moving      away from your location:    </p>    <p>      <em>Rainbow at night, shepherd's delight;<br />      Rainbow in morning, shepherd's warning.</em>    </p>    <p>      Even more accurate is the relationship between a rainbow,      the wind and rain . . . if you can remember that windward      is the direction from which the wind is coming and leeward      is where it's headed:    </p>    <p>      <em>Rainbow to windward, foul falls the day;<br />      Rainbow to leeward, rain runs away.</em>    </p>    <p>      Actually, there's just no end to old folk sayings that can      help you predict the weather. There's one about Dutchman's      britches in the morning foretelling fair weather in the      afternoon . . . the exact wording of which I've long      forgotten. No matter. What it means is that a patch of blue      on an otherwise cloudy or rainy morning heralds clear skies      later in the day. It seems to work more often than not. If      you tire of pithy folk predictions, you can always fall      back on weather indicators from the bible. . . such as:    </p>    <p>      <em>When ye see a cloud rise out of the west,<br />      straightaway cometh the rain; and so it is.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Luke 12:54</em>    </p>    <p>      Come to think of it, though, this sign is not as reliable      as many of the others . . . due, no doubt, to the erratic      nature of both storms and prophets. Maybe Luke should have      backed off a hair and relied a little more heavily on good      of rule-of-thumb . . . such as the down home reckoning that      says you can sometimes (particularly in autumn) judge the      path of a storm by distant lightning in the sky. Since most      weather does move from west to east, lightning in the north      or south generally signals a storm that will pass you by      while lightning in the west is a reasonably sure sign that      heavy weather will soon reach you.<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>LONG RANGE FORECASTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's where y' takes yer chances. Long term weather      predictions can be uncannily accurate or hopelessly absurd      . . . depending on where you're located, how you interpret      the signs and whether or not you live right. There's no      doubt that some seasonal forecasts have a strong basis in      fact. We know, for example, that a more or less continuous      covering of snow prevents the alternate freezing and      thawing of the ground that is damaging to wheat and other      winter grains. Such a winter also usually delays the      blooming of fruit trees until the danger of killing frosts      is past. So it rings true when we say:    </p>    <p>      <em>If there be neither snow nor rain,</em> <em><br />      Then will be dear all sorts of grain.</em>    </p>    <p>      and    </p>    <p>      <em>A year of snow, fruit will grow.</em>    </p>    <p>      Another proverb-right more often than wrong-is      based on the observation that weather which is mild until      Christmas can turn really fierce for the rest of the      season:    </p>    <p>      <em>A green Christmas makes a fat graveyard.</em>    </p>    <p>      Then there's the long term forecasts that certainly sound      good . . . but only seem to prove out about 50% of the      time. Things like: if cats, foxes and other animals have      particularly heavy coats in the fall there will be a long,      hard winter . . . when husks adhere closely to corn ears      and are unusually difficult to pull apart the cold season      will be most severe . . . skunks coming in from the woods      and nesting under barns and outbuildings (and houses!) are      a sign of rough weather on the way. And I guess we'll      always have our seasonal prophets who really raise eyebrows      by saying things such as, "Wide brown stripes on      woolly-bear caterpillars in the fall indicate a mild      winter but narrow brown stripes foretell a winter that is      hard." The American Museum of Natural History has done a      series of annual woolly-bear studies that seem to disprove      this . . . but that hasn't discouraged the      woolly-bear watchers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FACTS AND FIGURES</strong>    </p>    <p>      So much for weather lore. Accompanying this article is an      assortment of tables, charts and illustrations that should      be more than somewhat helpful as you begin your own      predictions.
