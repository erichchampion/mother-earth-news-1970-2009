            <p id="issur">      Issue # 70 - July/August 1981    </p>    		<hr />    <p>      Combine a iunked bicycle with a weed-filled vegetable patch      and a bit of ingenuity, and you'll have . .    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by William and Jimmie Ruttencutter    </h5>		    <p>      Each year, as winter makes its molassess-low way toward      spring, my wife and I can barely contain our eagerness to      get to work in the garden again . . . to till, plant, weed,      meditate, and generally enjoy one of the deep and subtle      satisfactions of life. (Thoreau once described gardening as      "making the earth say beans instead of grass".)    </p>    <p>      And every summer-as we discovered hordes of undesired      plants growing just as steadily as our intended      crops-we wished we had a good hand-powered push      cultivator. But alas, the $30 to $50 purchase price of the      classic garden implements always overpowered our desire to      own one.    </p>    <p>      A year ago, though, I finally noticed the resemblance      between that common weeding tool and the front wheel/main      chassis of an ordinary one-speed bicycle. Before long, 1'd      figured out how to convert a discarded two-wheel      transporter into a functioning garden cultivator.    </p>    <p>      First, I cut off the tubing in front of both the bike's      seat and its main sprocket .. . leaving the triangle that      forms the back part of the frame intact. I then replaced      the cycle's rear wheel with its front one and removed the      pedals, crank, chain, front sprocket, and internal parts      from the bike's drive mechanism. Next, I turned the      trimmed-down unit upside down and replaced the bike's seat      with a bolted-on set of cultivator tines! ([,had these      lying around, but they can be bought at most hardware      stores.)    </p>    <p>      At this point, my cultivator's body had taken shape . . .      the tool just needed a steering mechanism. I used a section      of threaded pipe for the cultivator's shaft. To attach this      conduit to the former bike's bottom bracket, I cut a hole      through the side of this frame cylinder, thrust one end of      the pipe into this opening, and secured it in place with      nuts on both the inside and outside of the bracket.    </p>    <p>      Then I used the handlebar's original collar clamp to secure      the bike's grips to the other end of the pipe section . . .      and-behold!-I had created the Fabulous      Bullwinkle Garden Cultivator (named after the famous      cartoon moose that the device sort of resembles).    </p>    <p>      So if you too have dreamed of having your own big-wheeled      garden tool, consider giving a discarded bicycle a new use      in life. After all, the Fabulous Bullwinkle Garden      Cultivator may not look classy . . . but it really works.    </p>
