                <p>      <em>As this magazine has noted in the past, the South      American country of Brazil isthrough its renowned alcohol      fuels program-currently a global leader in making the      transition from fossil to renewable energy. Unfortunately,      though, that nation may also be providing all of us with a      lesson in how to misuse even an ecologically promising      idea. To give our readers an inside look into Brazil's many      environmental troubles (which include, but are far from      limited to, its alcohol fuels program), we're sharing this      excellent interview with Jose Lutzenberger, the man known      as</em> <em>...</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Herman E. Daly    </h5>        <p>      Brazil occupies half the continent of South America, and is      therefore responsible for the caretaking of a large portion      of our planetary ecosystem. Unfortunately, the current      Brazilian regime seems to have seven basic modes of dealing      with the environment: [1] Dig it up, [2] cut it down, [3]      fill it in, [4] dam it, [5] burn it, [6] plant it with      monocultures (then spray them with chemical biocides), or      [7] overwhelm it with massive concentrations of people.    </p>    <p>      This repertory is partly an inheritance from the Portuguese      ... who originally came to the New World for the purpose of      rapid, temporary exploitation rather than permanent      settlement. It is also partly derived from the modern      ideologies of growthmania and the consumer society, which      Brazil seems to have learned from the United States. Today,      however, some citizens of the South American country are      outraged at the unprecedented environmental destruction      occurring in their land . . . and are making an effort to      stop it. Their leader and guru is Jose A. Lutzenberger, an      agricultural engineer of German descent who lives in the      nation's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul.    </p>    <p>      "Lutz", as he is called by his many friends, is essentially      playing the same role in Brazil today as was played by      Rachel Carson of the U.S. in the early 1960's. In fact, it      might be more accurate to say that he's functioning as a      combination Rachel Carson, Paul Ehrlich, Amory Lovins, and      David Brower. . . because Lutzenberger has been dedicating      his efforts to fighting not just one threat to the ecology,      but four: pesticides, overpopulation, energy waste, and      nuclear power. In addition, he founded Brazil's most      effective environmental protection association, AGAPAN.    </p>    <p>      Jose's career as an ecologist began-oddly      enough-while he was working for a multinational firm      as a technical advisor on chemical fertilizers and      biocides. Gradually, over a period of 14 years (which      included many repeated visits to the same sites), he      observed that the net result of modern agriculture was to      reduce the long-run capacity of the earth to support life .      . . and noted, with horror, the "mafiosi" methods used by      many multinational agrichemical firms. For someone who      subscribes to Albert Schweitzer's "Reverence for Life" as a      basic ethical principle, these were painful realizations      indeed.    </p>    <p>      So instead of rationalizing or making excuses for his part      in this devastation, Lutz-ten years ago, at the age      of 44-quit his lucrative job, returned to his na tive      city of PÃ´rto Alegre, and began making a living as a      landscape architect. Later he founded a small consulting      firm called "Convivial Technology" (using the phrase coined      by author and social critic Ivan IIlich). Lutzenberger      earns only a modest living from these activities, though,      because he devotes most of his time to unpaid environmental      defense work. His inside knowledge of the pesticide      industry and his personal experience with organic      agriculture have made him the nemesis of the      agri-industrial/chemical complex in Brazil, a country which      is the world's third largest user of biocides.    </p>    <p>      I first met Lutz in January of 1976, while giving a course      in economics and ecology in Rio Grande do Sul. Our      friendship was renewed in November of 1980, when I visited      with him for several days in Porto Alegre. On both      occasions I urged him to write something in English for      American environmental magazines, but he insisted that he      couldn't spare the time. Therefore, I offered to      reconstruct our conversations and correspondence in the      form of a written interview, and he agreed to read and edit      my manuscript. This is the result.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> When I was here five years ago, you      had a limited reputation as a somewhat quixotic figure with      an exaggerated affec tion for trees. But now you're famous      all over Brazil, and receive ten times as many invitations      to speak as you can possibly accept. What happened?    </p>        <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> Since you were here, we've      succeeded in raising our people's ecological consciousness      a great deal. In fact, we've made much more headway than I      ever expected, particularly among agronomists.    </p>    <p>      In Europe, the U.S., Australia, Japan, Canada,      and-indeed-most parts of the world, there are      healthy and burgeoning organic agriculture movements, but      the average <em>commercial</em> agronomists in such areas      are either unaware of the push for wholistic growing or are      actively hostile to it. We now have the opposite situation      here. There is almost no organic agriculture currently      being practiced in Brazil, but most of our agronomists are      eager for change and frustrated by not knowing how to bring      it about.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> I remember the beautiful      demonstration garden you made in the park at Torres. You      created a rich soil on top of pure sand and had everything      so well balanced that insects were automatically      controlled. Didn't that serve as an example of organic      agriculture?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> The park in Tories is in the      process of decay . . . our state government didn't renew my      contract a year ago. Of course, the government people don't      like me. I attack them viciously for their attacks on the      environment, since I feel that hard words are needed when      speaking to that mafia. So I accept the fact that they'll      retaliate. They spend almost nothing on the park now. It      hurts me to see it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> Yet while the government was      sabotaging your park, your colleagues elected you      "agronomist of the year". How did that come about?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> It happened !n spite of a      bitter backstage fight by ANDEF [an agrichemical lobby that      includes some 20 multinational companies]. After the first      vote, ANDEF tried to annul the prize ... but a new election      was held, and-on that second ballot-even most      of the agronomists employed in the chemical industry voted      for me! I won 414 to 6.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> That's very encouraging, but has the      outlook for Brazil's environment improved as your fame has      increased"    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> No. Winning that election      was only a small victory. It doesn't mean that anything has      changed regarding the wholesale destruction of Nature in      Brazil. In fact, there has never in the history of Life      been a biological holocaust such as the one being conducted      here. Thousands of species disappear every year without      anybody's noticing. If the zebra, the elephant, the      giraffe, or any other wellknown creature were to vanish      forever, the passing would be covered by radio, television,      and the world press. But every time a unique ecosystem is      wiped out (and we've had thousands ruined in Brazil's      Amazon basin) uncounted endemic species go with it ... most      of which are less conspicuous forms of life such as the      small vertebrates or invertebrates, insects, spiders, and      rare plants.    </p>    <p>      And as you know, the Universe is poorer for every species      that goes. Each lifeline in the Symphony of Evolution is a      unique, irreversible historical process that can be cut off      but can never be resumed thereafter. Whether increasing      ecological consciousness will, in time, provoke a reversal      of this country's practices remains to be seen. I can only      hope so for our children's sake, for <em>Life's</em> sake!    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> Just what is going on in the Amazon      basin?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> One of the most complex and      wonderful of biomes is being burned, knocked down by great      chains dragged between huge tractors, defoliated with Agent      Orange, etc. Entire communities of plants and animals are      being irrevocably lost, and in their place are being      planted vast monocultures (actually hypermonocultures of a      size never before imagined . . . with hundreds of thousands      of hectares planted in one crop) or equally big chunks of      unnatural pastureland.    </p>    <p>      And these man-made farms and ranches are-of      course-inherently unstable. Most last less than five      years and, while they endure, require massive doses of      biocides and fertilizers . . . poisons that pollute rivers      and lakes and kill wildlife.    </p>    <p>      Entire Indian cultures are being wiped out, as well. What      right, other than that of brute force, allows our own      society to invade the Indians' world with heavy machinery,      chain saws, and chemical defoliants sprayed by airplanes?      Who, in such a case, are the real barbarians?    </p>    <p>      As the Amazon caboclo [Indian] says, "Where cattle move in,      hunger comes along and we move out." Yet the meat      production on our "modern" ranches is ridiculously low . .      . around 30 pounds per acre per year. Compare that to      what's being done in northern Europe, where-despite a      much more difficult climate-yields of 600 pounds of      meat and 800 gallons of milk per acre per year are      achieved.    </p>    <p>      But the owners, who are mostly powerful Brazilian      politicians or the executives of multinational      corporations, don't care. Their profit derives from the      incredible size of the operations, from government      subsidies, and from corruption.    </p>    <p>      Yet we have sufficient land in Brazil to allow us to easily      postpone "developing" the Amazon until we know enough about      the marvelous patterns of life there to do so intelligently      and sustainably. Our government must find ways to restrain      both its own greed and that of foreign companies. We have      much to learn from the remaining Indian tribes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> With the failure of the touted      "Brazilian Economic Miracle" and the nation's overall      declining economy, such restraint is pretty unlikely.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> Yes, the economic situation      has never been worse in Brazil. A few members of the      military, which-back in 1964-had a great      opportunity to create order, chose instead to become      henchmen for multinational businesses. As a re suit of the      actions of such individuals and the firms that support      them, inflation is now over 140% annually ... and we owe      more than $60 billion to outside interests. Since our      country earns only $13 billion a year from its exports,      more than half of our national trade income goes simply to      pay interest on debt. The remainder isn't even sufficient      to finance our petroleum imports.    </p>    <p>      So the debt will likely grow and inflation will get worse.      Nevertheless, the governing mafia plans to build 60 nuclear      power plants by 1995! Never before has one seen such      madness! Fortunately, it will probably not succeed. I put      some hope, ironically, in the world depression that has      already been triggered.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> Within this bleak picture, many      people are placing all their hopes on Brazil's alcohol fuel      program, PROALCOOL.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> The alcohol program      is-unfortunately-another calamity. It will be      solely in the hands of the international petroleum,      automobile, and chemical companies and will spread over the      rest of Brazil the kind of feudal landholding system that      already disgraces our Northeast.    </p>    <p>      If today millions of our land's nordestinos      [Northeasterners] are forced to migrate to the stinking      favelas [slums] of Rio and Sao Paulo, it is because they      have been pushed out of their native region by sugar cane      monoculture. PROALCOOL threatens to extend this process of      displacing people from the land.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> Couldn't alcohol fuel be made by      small producers, employing people in the interior, and      ultimately substituting a renewable resource for rapidly      diminishing petroleum?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> Of course it could! One can      imagine a system of small-scale independent distilleries      producing fuel for local use and converting the vinhoto, or      slop, into a good organic fertilizer. It would then become      possible to avoid large-scale monoculture and learn to live      within an ecological budget. If our basic goals were the      ecologically inspired dreams of the steady-state or      homeostatic economy, we could make good use of biomass      energy. The success of such a program, however, depends      upon scale and rate of development, and-beyond      that-upon the structure of power in society.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, in Brazil as in all other countries that I      can think of, the official program calls for an      ever-expanding economy that rides roughshod over ecological      limits and tends to centralize power and promote only those      technologies that are themselves centralizing. PROALCOOL,      for example, even though it does permit the small      distilleries to produce, requires them to sell to a      centralized distributing agency.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> What other effects will the      PROALCOOL program have?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> The sugar cane monoculture      implicit in PROALCOOL is one of the many threats to the      Amazon and to the Pantanal, the great swamp in Mato Grosso      that is one of the last natural paradises on earth.    </p>    <p>      Since-alcohol production displaces food crops (Brazil      already has to import its national staple, black beans),      filling one's stomach will be more expensive than it      otherwise would have been . . . while auto fuel may be less      expensive than it otherwise would have been. And, of      course, the poor spend a large percentage of their income      on food and nothing at all on auto fuel. The middle and      upper classes, however, spend a smaller percentage on food      and a significant amount on auto fuel. So PROALCOOL will      effectively harm those who are most in need of help. And      because-as I've already said-the government's      fuel program will also promote feudal landholding patterns,      largescale distilleries, and centralized distribution . . .      it's hard to see how the present plan can avoid worsening      an already unjust distribution of income and wealth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> The large-scale nature of PROALCOOL      seems to illustrate a general relationship between power      and technology.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> We have a vicious circle.      The more complex and integrated the technology, the greater      its demand for capital and its need for bureaucratic      management. And the technocracy, in turn, demands and      promotes only sophisticated and large-scale technologies      that further concentrate economic power. That is why      nuclear power or huge hydropower projectssuch as the      12,000-megawatt Itaipu plant-are favored by the      government.    </p>    <p>      On a lower technological level, consider the average      caboclo family of the Amazon. Living on the riverbank, they      exist in the midst of plenty. They catch all the fish they      can use. The forest provides an incredible variety of      fruits, herbs, roots, and medicines. There is plenty of      game. They have all the free fuel they need. They      complement their diet with small gardens of manioc, sweet      potatoes, beans, corn, and some vegetables. They keep a      pig, a few chickens, and sometimes a cow or two. And the      harm they cause the forest is well within its capacity for      natural recovery.    </p>    <p>      Now, some agricultural extension programs are beginning to      instruct such people in the methods of "modern"      chicken-farming factories. "Scientifically balanced"      rations are formulated in Manaus-600 miles away-by      big firms that use corn, wheat, or soybeans imported from      the U.S. and powdered milk from the European Common Market.      The broilers and laying hens are hybrid, of course, which      means the caboclos cannot use the eggs to reproduce their      flocks themselves. Yet they are giving up their      traditional, locally adapted chickens that are immune to      many diseases . . . and, as a result, must use imported      medicine, hormones, antibodies, etc.    </p>    <p>      And the buyer of the farmers' products is the firm that      furnishes all the raw materials, so the small-scale      chicken-raisers have absolutely no influence on price      either way. All the risks are theirs . . . all the      advantages are with the big companies.    </p>    <p>      Such programs-do no; provide means of improving food      production. Instead, they create dependence. And this is      really what "development" is all about. Independent      individuals who have the ability to decide their own      destinies are rapidly becoming extinct!    </p>    <p>      Indeed, the caboclos are-most of the      time-simply displaced by immense agribusiness schemes      that totally extinguish their paradise . . . send them to      the slums in big cities far away . . . or employ them as      inexpensive help under labor camp conditions. In      not-so-rare cases, the big guy actually uses machine guns      on "squatters" or "ferocious" Indians!    </p>    <p>      The crowning irony, however, is that the energy flow of      modern chicken farming makes it a net absorber of food      available to humans, whereas the traditional system was a      net provider of food energy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> Anyone in Brazil who criticizes the      government as strongly as you do is likely to be called a      Communist. What do say in reply to that charge?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> How could a man or a woman      with any ecological understanding advocate Communism? In a      capitalist system you have a lot of little or large      bandits, and you can play them off one against another and      find some living space in the gaps. Under Communism you      have one big centralized, allpowerful, unified mafia . . .      and there's nowhere to hide.    </p>    <p>      Communist countries lack the stabilizing negative teedback      of a parliament, the separation of powers, an independent      conservation movement, and a free flow of information.      Worse yet, they're even more dedicated to megatechnology      and growth than are capitalist !ands. In short, they do all      the things that the Brazilian technocrats and their leaders      want to do . . . so maybe I should be calling the      government Communistic!    </p>    <p>      We need something better than either Communism or modern      capitalism: We need an ecologically sane, homeostatic,      steadystate economy. No system that depends on continuous      growth can be ecologically viable. The fact that Communism      is worse than capitalism should be cold comfort to those of      us in capitalist countries. I believe that all      centralization of power is bad.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> Lutz, we have yet to consider the      most fundamental and controversial environmental issue in      Brazil: population. Twelve years ago I wrote an article on      overpopulation in South America, and I'm amazed to see how      little the debate has progressed since then.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> We desperately need a      serious effort to reduce our nation's population growth.      The necessity can be proved by elementary arithmetic! If,      in Brazil, we still have a bitter debate about the need for      birth control, it's due not only to lack of knowledge of      the facts, but also to ideological commitments and the      crassest kind of class interest in maintaining an unlimited      supply of inexpensive labor to promote      ever-increasing concentrations of power.    </p>    <p>      The fact is that the upper and middle classes already      practice birth control, but not the lower class. This      incomplete "de mocratization" of birth control reinforces      the inequality in the distribution of per capita income ...      or, as the old saying goes, "The rich get richer and the      poor get children."    </p>    <p>      Historically, population explosion has almost always been      the result of the destruction of traditional cultures by      conquerors. For 20 or 30, thousand years, Brazil's Indians      lived in relative harmony with Nature, and even though the      forest must have seemed unlimited to them, they were very      conscious of the demographic problem and applied deliberate      controlsincluding infanticide-when a tribe became too      large. Today, though, the villages of the "civilized"      Indians display tremendous population growth and horrible      devastation of the environment.    </p>    <p>      Given its actual style of living and level of consumption,      Brazil is already badly overpopulated . . . because the      current situation is unsustainable. In that respect,      however, the U.S. is even more overpopulated than Brazil .      . . and is especially so if you count the depredation and      waste caused by your suicidal armaments race with the      Soviet Union.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> That's a good point. And the U.S.      has yet to make any official effort to limit either its      population or its per capita consumption. Nor have the U.S.      and the U.S.S.R. agreed to eliminate a single bomb or      missile from their arsenals. Until we do something      ourselves, our preaching on population will not be taken      seriously.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> Exactly!    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> Many people in your nation claim      that environmental concern is an elitist hobby ... and that      it distracts attention from Brazil's more pressing problems      of poverty and injustice, which-according to the      argument-require rapid growth for their solutions.      How do you answer such individuals?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> I point out that, contrary      to their claims, it is the growth mythology itself that has      allowed us to put off dealing with questions of      distributive justice. As long as faith in the myth of the      eternal growth of the cake persists, we can say that those      with the smallest proportional slices should wait patiently      for the cake to grow bigger before we redivide it more      fairly. Otherwise, premature redistribution would hurt the      poor ... by slowing down the cake's growth rate.    </p>    <p>      But when we finally realize that the cake is not      growing-that, in fact, it is even      shrinking-then no longer will we be able to avoid      facing up to demands for at least a minimum of justice in      the distribution of income. For this reason, the myth of      perpetual growth is most strongly championed by those who      no longer believe it themselves, but who find it in their      interests that everyone else should accept it.    </p>    <p>      Ecological concern and social justice are as inseparable as      are the two faces of a coin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DALY:</strong> One last question, Lutz. What      principles do you feel we must build upon if we are ever to      reverse the destruction of the world's ecosystems and      arrive at a sustainable homeostatic society?    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUTZENBERGER:</strong> First, we must arrest the      process of desecration of Nature, and stop excluding from      our code of ethics all concerns for anything not related or      useful to humanity. We all have to adopt Albert      Schweitzer's fundamental ethical principle of Reverence for      Life in each of its forms.    </p>    <p>      Second, we must accept a symphonic vision of Organic      Evolution in which humanity is only one instrument in the      orchestra. The idea of a symphony emphasizes cooperation,      harmony, and mutual adjustment. In an orchestra, every      instrument is complementary and indispensable to all the      others. It's in this complementarity that greatness      resides!    </p>    <p>      And third, we must take another look at the technologies      that serve us. Today's hard technology, designed to benefit      the powerful, must give way to soft technology conceived in      the interests of not only humanity, but all Nature.    </p>    <p>      Our race may be destined to become conductor of the      ecological symphony, but only if we learn to lead-and      not destroy-our many musicians.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Herman E.
