                		<h3>dulcimers revisited!		</h3>    <h5 id="byline">      by MARC BRISTOL    </h5>		<hr />        <p>      <em>Even homesteaders need to relax and enjoy themselves from      time to time, right? And almost everybody these days wants      to cut his or her cost of living. So how about a little      do-it-yourself entertainment?</em><br />      <br />      <em>And that's what this column is all about. Down-home      music that you can make . . . and the instruments (which,      in some cases, you can also make!) to play that music      on.<br />      <br /></em> <em>The important thing is that this is your      column. If you like it, write to me and let me know. If you      have some ideas for this feature, let me know that. I'm      open to any suggestions or information you care to      contribute. I'll even try to answer your questions about      down-home music . . . but-both for the benefit of all      MOTHER's readers and to ease my correspondence      load-I'll deal with those questions, whenever      possible, here in this column . . . rather than in personal      letters.<br />      <br /></em> <em>Address your correspondence for this column      and this column only-to Marc Bristol, 18520 312th      Ave. N.E., Duvall, Wash. 98019.<br />      <br />      <br /></em> When I covered the subject of dulcimers a      couple of issues back in MOTHER NO. 67, I <em>thought</em>      it might result in a popular article. Well, the many      responses that you've sent to me-and to those folks      in the dulcimer business whom I referred to in the      column-certainly proved me correct on that score . . . so      I'm plunging right in with some <em>more</em> tidbits I've      gathered since that article was written.<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>HAMMERED DULCIMERS</strong></p><p>      Actually, I'm going to start this column with a discussion      of hammered dulcimers: large, many-stringed      musicmakers-played with small sticklike hammers-which are      really quite different instruments from the smaller,      threeor four-stringed Appalachian "lap" dulcimers I      described in issue 67. (Well, the two instruments aren't      <em>completely</em> different . . . they do both belong to      the <em>zither</em> family.)<br />      <br />      The name "dulcimer" has been associated with the hammered      variety since biblical times, but has been applied to the      smaller, fretted instrument for only around the last 200      years. Since the word literally means "sweet      tune"-and both instruments do, indeed, produce      mellifluous tones-perhaps some old mountaineer      plucked the instrument title out of the Good Book and      attached it to the Appalachian melody-maker.<br />      <br />      The large hammered music box is a forerunner of the piano,      but the pounding pieces that strike its strings are held in      the player's hands instead of being built into the      instrument's body and mechanically operated. Many countries      throughout Europe and Asia have traditional versions of the      hammered dulcimer-and a great many styles of music      are played on them-but the basic form of ancient      "sweet-tuner" is nothing more than a trapezoidal sound box      that has several groups (or "courses") of strings passing      over a support (or side bridge) at one end of the      instrument, across an off-center bridge, and over another      support to the other end. (Some dulcimers have two central      bridges . . . the second being used to carry an extra set      of bass strings.) The midbridge is a distinctive trait of      the hammered dulcimer, and distinguishes the instrument      from <em>its</em> ancestor, the psaltery.<br />      <br />      As you can see in the accompanying diagram, a homemade      hammered dulcimer can be built from scraps of dimensional      lumber and plywood. You will probably need to purchase      tuning pegs (old piano pegs will work fine), a tuning      wrench (a hardware store "tapping chuck" should serve the      purpose), and a supply of No. 7 or No. 8 music wire (it's      available from most music stores, hobby shops, and mail      order music supply houses). In addition, you can expect to      get superior tone from the finished instrument if you build      its top-the sounding board-from a good piece of      spruce.<br />      <br />      The dulcimer's top and back are simply secured with a good      wood glue, then nailed in place. (Be sure to avoid putting      any of the metal fasteners where the tuning pegs will later      be installed.) Each string is wrapped three or four times      around a tuning peg, laid over the offcenter bridge, looped      around a hitch pin on the opposite side, and then run back      to <em>another</em> peg on the original side. Every wire      then forms two strings, and each pair will give one note on      the right side of the main bridge and another (a fifth      higher) on the left side of the divider.<br />      <br />      One standard tuning for a 12-course hammered      dulcimer-running from low notes at the bottom of the      instrument to high ones at the top-is G#, A, B, C#      (this is the CM just above middle C), D, E, F#, G, A, B, C,      and D on the left side of the bridge . . . and C#, D, E,      F#, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on the right side of the      bridge. You'll have to adjust the new instrument several      times, over a period of days, before it'll "settle down"      and stay in tune.<br />      <br />      For a more complete version of these instructions, send      $3.75 (postpaid) to Mugwumps, Dept. TMEN, 1600 Billman      Lane, Silver Spring, Maryland 20902 for "The Hammer      Dulcimer Compendium". The package will include some playing      information and history as well as building plans. (      <em>Mugwumps</em> magazine, by the way, is devoted to the      subject of hammered dulcimers and other vintage musical      instruments, comes out six times annually, and costs $12      for a year's subscription. A sample issue can be ordered      for $2.00. )<br />      <br />      A prominent hammered dulcimerist, Sam Rizzetta, has written      yet another construction guide, "Making a Hammered      Dulcimer" . . . and a publication called "Hammer Dulcimer      History and Playing". Both documents are      available-free for the asking-from Public      Inquiry Mail, Smithsonian Institution, Dept. TMEN,      Washington, D.C. 20560.<br />      <br />      Many companies offer kits for building hammered dulcimers,      too. Ray Mooers, of the Dusty Strings Dulcimer Company,      dropped in one day recently and showed me his firm's two      basic models of sweettuners (one single-bridged and the      other double-bridged). Both are available as kits that need      only sanding, finishing, and stringing. Prices start at      $165 . . . and the package comes complete with an owner's      guidebook. Additional options can be ordered at extra cost.      For example, a basic kit with a spruce soundboard costs      $195. You can write for a free catalog to Dusty Strings      Dulcimer Company, Dept. TMEN, 1848 Northeast Ravenna      Boulevard, Seattle, Washington 98105.<br />      <br />      (Other sources for kits, books, records, and accessories      were mentioned in my columns in issues 55, 63, and 67.      )    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE APPALACHIAN DULCIMER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Moving back to the lap dulcimers I discussed three issues      ago, I'm pleased to report that there was considerable      response to my mention of the cardboard dulcimer kits sold      by David Cross of Backyard Music. David's moved since I      wrote that column andjudging from some of my      correspondence-not all of his mail has been      forwarded, so here's his new address: Backyard Music, Dept.      TMEN, 509 South 44th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania      19104.<br />      <br />      While resting between sets with the Okie Doke Band at a      local energy fair, I met Hank and Robin Levin of Smoggy      Mountain Dulcimers, which is a company that makes just one      product . . . an Appalachian dulcimer kit. As you can      imagine, the couple have perfected that item and make every      attempt to be competitive in price and quality with the      other do-it-yourself dulcimer packages on the market. The      Smoggy Mountain kit is called the "Tennessee Teardrop" and      features a cherry body. No special tools or skills are      required to assemble the instrument (the parts are already      cut and bent to shape) . . . and the package inc ludes a      simple, well-illustrated instruction sheet. When you're      done, you'll have a fullsized, four-string mountain      dulcimer for only $48 postpaid . . . a price that even      includes the glue! Write to Smoggy Mountain, Dept. TMEN,      P.O. Box 888. Granite Falls, Washington 98252 for further      details.<br />      <br />      I'm also happy to tell you that Rose LeClere and David      Johnston (at Black Mountain Instruments) have gotten such a      great response to my mention of their lap dulcimer kit in      MOTHER NO. 67 that they've decided to offer discounts to      the readers of the Homegrown Music column. . . 25% off a      kit's price, and 20% off the cost of a case. You can't beat      a deal like that! Black Mountain's basic kitwhich I listed      before as costing $53-is a bit fancier than Smoggy      Mountain's (for one thing, it has a spruce top), but it      doe;: produce a smaller instrument. For more information,      write to Rose and Davidat Black Mountain Instruments, Dept.      TMEN, P.O. Box 779, Lower Lake, Cali fornia 95457-and tell      them MOTHER sent you!<br />      <br />      Another valuable resource for lap dul cimer builders is an      Oak Publication: book, <em>Jean Ritchie's Dulcimer      People</em> . Much of the volume is devoted to provided ing      information about the tradition of the fretted instrument,      as well as about some of the different playing styles in      Jean's "extended dulcimer-playing fam- fly". It also      includes some instruction provided by Hank Levin (a member      of that family) on how to build an instrument from scratch      . . . which might be of great assistance to anyone      assembling a lap dulcimer kit, as well. The entire book is      a fine acquisition for folks interested in the Appalachian      dulcimer . . . and it costs only $5.95-plus $1.00      shipping and handling-from the Music Sales      Corporation, Dept. TMEN, Bellvale Road, Ches ter, New York      10918. Oak also carries <em>The Hammered Dulcimer</em> ,      for the same price. (Be sure to ask for the firm's free      catalog while you're at it.)<br />      <br />      <strong>MISCELLANY</strong></p><p>      Well, once you've mastered your dulcimer playing      skills-on either kind of instrument-and you're      ready to make the whole world sing, where should you head?      My advice is to set out for Winfield, Kansas . . . which      hosts the annual National Guitar Flatpicking Championships.      The event includes separate contests for both hammered and      mountain dulcimers, as well as for fingerpicked guitar,      bluegrass banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and autoharp.<br />      <br />      This year's festival-from September 17 through      20-will be the tenth anniversary of the      championships. Attendance is limited, so advance tickets      area must. Write to Walnut Valley Association, Inc., Dept.      TMEN, Box 245, Winfield, Kansas 67156 for more      details.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A CLOSING NOTE</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you like tub bass and washboard playing, western swing,      and/or rockabilly, you might enjoy our long-awaited (well,      by me, at any rate) Okie Doke Band record, a seven-inch LP      that includes "Snake-Charmin' Baby", "Coot From Tennessee",      "Milk Cow Blues", and "Let's Boogie". Our group, by the      way, packages the small disks in the plastic sleeves used      by collectors of old 45's-and we include an      attractive folded insert-so the well-protected      records now look pretty slick, to boot! If you'd like to      see our new mini-album (and, of course, listen to four of      our favorite tunes), you can order the Okie Doke Band      record for $4.00 (postpaid) from King Noodle Records, Dept.      TMEN, Box 25, Duvall, Washington 98109.<br />      <br />    </p>
