                    <p>      As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.    </p>    <p>      Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over again.    </p>    <p>      And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.    </p>    <p>      Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N. C. 28791. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we all can read what      the Nearing have to say.    </p>        <p>      We've been thinking very seriously of a move to the "good      life", but we're totally "green". Perhaps you can help to      put us on the right track.    </p>    <p>      First, would we be better in an area of Arkansas with five      or ten acres of good soil, or in Florida where the growing      season is longer, or in Maine? Are the advantages of a cold      climate outweighed by the disadvantages?    </p>    <p>      Second, how much reserve cash should a couple have on hand      before heading "back to the land"?    </p>    <p>      Third, could we become totally food self-sufficient with      only a garden and limited livestock?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Every area of the country has its advantages and      disadvantages in terms of climate, soil, etc. By actually      living in each region for an established time period, you      could probably gather enough information to make the      necessary comparisons. We've gardened only in New England,      and are aware only of its advantages and disadvantages. Our      area has a short growing season (about 105 frost-free      days), while Florida has more than 300. We still prefer New      England-with its crisp autumns and springs and its      cold winters and sturdy characters-over Florida's (in      our opinion) sterile, thin soil and vapid social      climate.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Regarding your" cash question": Conservatively      speaking, a couple starting to work toward a      self-sufficient life in the country should have enough      working capital to survive for three years without counting      on any income. During that period they should be able to      determine, through experience, what would prove to be an      adequate cash crop.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lastly, vegetables from a home garden (unless you      sell a good proportion by market gardening) do not pay      taxes and cover other necessary expenses of running a      homestead. You have to have some source of cash income in      this modern world.</strong>    </p>    <p>      We plan to heat our home with a woodstove this winter.      Frankly, we've been besieged with confusing (and often      contradictory) advice on the do's and don'ts of wood heat,      so we'd like to ask you a few questions.    </p>    <p>      Do you burn aged hardwood exclusively? If so, how long do      you age it? If not, do you find chimney creosote buildup a      regular problem? Is a modern airtight stove really worth      the difference in price from that of a used-but      serviceable-Franklin?    </p>    <p>      <strong>On our seaside property we have no "good" firewood.      Our nearest facsimile is white birch, which is not      considered a hardwood. The last few years we have purchased      a few cords of oak to supplement what we cut on our own      place (and pick up along the beach). We take care of the      occasional creosote problem by cleaning the flues and      chimney about every three months.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>To answer your other question, we have found that      airtight stoves burn less wood and carry the fire longer      without needing to be stoked. We used to have a large      Franklin stove that heated only one room. For the last      three years, however, we've used a "Free Flow" stove that      takes cold air from the floor, heats It, and propels warmth      through the house.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I eat only fruits and nuts, which I'd like to grow year      round in a greenhouse. What kind of setup would you      suggest?    </p>    <p>      <strong>If you are a fruitarian, you should probably reside      in the semitropics</strong> <strong>. . . where the items      necessary to your diet grow naturally, outdoors, in      abundance and variety. You would have to have an enormous      greenhouse in order to raise enough fruit and nut trees      indoors to supply all your food needs. It seems to us that      the southern states would offer more practical locations      for fruitarians.</strong>    </p>
