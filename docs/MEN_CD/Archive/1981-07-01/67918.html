                <p>      With a little bit of money and a lot of creativity, you too      can earn....    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by G.R. Osborne    </h5>        <p>      As an often-hungry freelance cartoonist, I'm always on the      lookout for ways to earn some extra income . . . and to do      so with as little expenditure of effort as possible! Well,      not long ago-when I was "volunteered" to help with my      daughter's Camp Fire Girls bazaar-I stumbled onto an      easy method of getting that spare-time scratch.    </p>    <p>      While at the fair, I ran into a friend who had recently      obtained a "button" machine from a company called      Badge-A-Minit. By combining my cartooning ability and his      equipment, we made quite a hit with the patrons of the      bazaar. And even after that day was over, requests      continued to pour in .. . for school buttons, campaign      buttons, and buttons with "adult" themes.    </p>    <p>      Granted, my drawing ability helped our business expand      rapidly, but-as you'll soon see-you don't need      to be artistically inclined to make money with buttons.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING STARTED</strong>    </p>    <p>      My wife and I were aware-from "bazaar day"      on-of the tremendous possibilities the little      nonelectric device could hold for us. However, we decided      to postpone the purchase of a button maker until we could      afford to buy one of Badge-A-Minit's more expensive      machines. Our friend, you see, owned a small hand-held unit      that cost (at that time) $24. We thought that a more      durable model would better meet our needs . . . so we held      out for a sturdier bench type that went for $94.    </p>    <p>      The press is sold with enough badge parts to make 250      buttons . . . so as soon as I received the machine, I began      to practice. And, just as quickly, I started accumulating      "goofs". It seemed no matter how hard I tried, at least      eight of every ten buttons turned out wrong. Eventually I      realized that the problem wasn't my technique . . . rather,      the plastic dies that had come with the machine were      faulty.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, this discovery resulted in a flurry of letters      to the Badge-A-Minit company. I'm happy to report, though,      that within three weeks the firm sent me two new sets of      dies, as well as 50 new badge parts to make up for those      that had been ruined. (In fact, I've found the company to      be more than fair in its dealings.)    </p>    <p>      Once the new dies were in place, it didn't take me long to      begin earning up to $30 an hour with my new business. And      how-you may ask-did I round up cus tomers so      quickly? Well, I simply took my equipment to school      carnivals, swap meets, fairs, conventions, club meetings,      and political rallies. I called area boards of education      and the local chamber of commerce, and checked each day's      newspaper for listings of local events at which I might get      permission to sell my wares. Such happenings can be easy      pickings for folks who know how to slant their buttons to      each individual get-together.    </p>    <p>      And, although I usually draw my own figures and cartoons,      you could simply cut out photographs, comic strip      characters, or whatever illustrations you need. Remember my      friend who introduced me to the button business? He can't      draw a straight line with a ruler . . . yet he set up a      very successful enterprise by using his Polaroid camera to      create personal badges. For $2.50, he'll snap a requested      photo, trim it, and mount it on a button.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE PROOF IS IN THE PROFITS</strong>    </p>    <p>      My total initial outlay for equipment and materials came to      $101.10. This amount covered the press, a pair of scissors,      some felt-tip pens, fine-tip pens, colored pencils, typing      paper . . . and a small suitcase to cart the kit around in!      (If you decide you'd rather begin with a little hand-held      button-maker, you can lower that cost by $70.) I already      owned a portable drawing board and camp stool . . . and I      hand-printed my signs.    </p>    <p>      I priced my cartoon creations, which I called "BUTTOONS",      at $1.50 each. The profit from the first 250 badges I made      was $258 (naturally, I still had occasional failures). Of      that money, I spent $63.95 (plus shipping) to purchase      parts for 500 more badges, and was able to pocket the rest.      Once those buttons were made and sold, I bought 1,000 more      badge components . . . and again "kept the change".    </p>    <p>      Later on, I located another source that offers badge parts      similar to those sold by Badge-A-Minit . . . but at lower      prices. The company is called Mr. Button Products, and      you'll find the addresses of both firms at the end of this      article.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WAYS TO SAVE</strong>    </p>    <p>      I've found I can produce 15 identical sketches on one      standard sheet of typing paper. Then I take the master      sheet to a local printer and have it copied as many times      as is necessary to fill my order. The cost is low, and the      reproductions are well worth the expense because of the      time they save me. One word to the wise, however: Don't      count on getting accurate col or reproductions . . . in      spite of what the printer may tell you! I learned this      lesson the hard way while making 322 cartoon badges for a      state senator. I ended up having to handcolor the whole lot      . . . and my feelings toward a certain printing firm became      darker with each pen stroke.    </p>    <p>      <strong>YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN</strong>    </p>    <p>      You'll probably discover-as I did-that your      operation's worst enemy is often you yourself . . .      because, if you're not careful, you'll end up giving away a      lot of "freebies". This practice will sometimes produce      future orders, but generally isn't a good idea.    </p>    <p>      And there you have it . . . I've told you more than enough      to launch your own button-making career. Just remember to      keep your eyes and ears open for upcoming events, to spread      the word about your business, and to realize that anyone is      capable of cashing in on this moneymaking home enterprise      idea. So what are you waiting for? Get going, and be the      first buttoneer on your block!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Both companies men tioned above offer free      catalogs. Badge-A-Minit, Ltd. (Dept. TMEN, Box 618, Civic      Industrial Park, LaSalle, Illinois 61301) manufactures      button machines that range in price from $17.95 to $239.95.      Mr. Button Products (Dept. TMEN, P .O. Box 68355,      Indianapolis, Indiana 46268) sells machines in the $59.95      to $995 price range, and of fers 1,000 badge parts for      $109.95.    </p>
