                <p>      <strong>Reader's Forum on Solid-Fuel for '95</strong>    </p>            <p>      Over the past year, many readers have written in with      thoughtful questions about wood heat. We thought that all      of Mother's readers would be interested in the answers to      several of the most interesting.    </p>    <h3>      The Smoky Flue    </h3>    <p>      Jean-Anne Sylvester from outside of Cloverdale, Indiana      asks how to deal with wood stove with "...a stove pipe that      is stuffed up into the chimney over a fireplace. When its      windy outside, it won't catch fire without filling the      house with smoke, and it continues to puff out smaller but      eye-watering amounts throughout the fire's life."    </p>    <p>      This is a problem that has been around since Ben Franklin's      day.    </p>    <p>      First, be sure the "stuffing" around the stovepipe is 101%      fireproof, airtight and firmly fixed in place. Then check      to see if the stove is getting enough fresh air to feed      fire and flue exhaust. Open a window; if that solves the      problem, consider installing an air-supply inlet from the      cellar, or via ducting from the outside in the floor in      front of the hearth. And leave that window open till you      duct air in some other way. A smoldering fire and too      little draft due to insufficient air can fill the house      with carbon monoxide that can kill you in your sleep.    </p>    <p>      If (in violation of building and fire codes and common      sense) the fireplace shares either a flue or a limited      supply of combustion air with a flame-operated      appliance-a gas water heater, say-the potential      carbon monoxide danger can be even greater. Check, and if      you have a shared flue, quit using the wood burner till you      can manage a separate flue for it.    </p>    <p>      Since your stove smokes both on start -up and during the      burn when wind blows (unless the problem is too little air      supply), it has insufficient draft-which means that      the chimney is not pulling well enough. This plus the      installation into a fireplace scares me. There are so many      potential fire hazards in old stove set-ups, so please have      the fire inspector and/or a qualified installer of      solid-fuel appliances check yours. The flue may be too      small for the stove, may be clogged or the fireplace damper      half-shut. An expert will remove the stove, clean out all      ash and soot from stove and stove pipe, clean the flue,      make sure there is a clear and adequate flue opening all      the way to the roof, replace rusted stove pipe, and      reinstall the stove correctly, making sure all connections      are air tight.    </p>    <p>      A fair warning: the installer or building-inspector may      find that the installation does not meet fire code, and can      shut it down till it qualifies. Harsh perhaps, but a law      that is intended to keep you safe <em>and</em> warm.    </p>    <p>      Your chimney may be located on an outside wall of the      house, so it is hard to warm up. Or, the house may be under      a hill or in a wind chute so natural air movement works      against you. And/or the chimney may be too short. It's      cheating, but you can use your electric hair dryer to heat      a stubbornly cold flue... but not to keep it drawing. To      improve draft, add a foot or two of ceramic to the chimney      or install a metal flue-extender. To deflect wind or      falling air, put a wind turbine or revolving air vane on      the flue top.    </p>    <p>      Finally (or, perhaps first), be sure your fuel is      dry-at least 6 months off the stump, and out of the      woods and under cover long enough to be bone-dry on the      surface and cut ends. Wet wood is hard to start and green      wood will smoke.    </p>    <h3>      Mary Olson's PAPPA BEAR    </h3>    <p>      Mary Olson of Faribault MN operates a Day Care in her new      home that came with a Fisher Poppa Bear III, a big pre-EPA      welded steel stove that heats the whole house (with help of      a room-air-circulating fan). The stove is installed      according to code, and to the satisfaction of local      day-care regulators, but they won't permit Mary to fire it      up during Day Care until a railing is installed. She wants      to know if there are any published performance comparisons      for wood stoves, how she can reduce the heat pumped out by      the Big Bear, how to put up a railing that isn't an eyesore      and what price to ask if they decide to replace and sell      the stove (that is in good shape and has needed only to      have a fire brick or two replaced.)    </p>    <p>      This answer has three parts, so bear with us. We agree with      the Minnesota Day Care licensers; little kids and radiating      solid-fuel space heaters don't mix. One of my favorite      young people will always carry scars on one hand from when      he bumped into a stove despite a room full of older folks      that were looking after him... and him alone. Just the      thought of relatively few grownups in a wood-heated Day      Care full of creepers, crawlers and toddlers should be      enough to cause cold sweats.    </p>    <p>      No stoves but Shenandoah, Rite-Way or Ashley-type      steel-boxed "Circulator"-type automated heaters (with metal      shells around the firebox) are remotely safe to stumble      against, and even they get too hot: a small stove gets just      as hot as a big one.    </p>    <p>      It's tough to install a toddler-railing that doesn't look      pretty obvious. It must be located far enough beyond the      stove that it stays cool to the touch-that means that      is should be at least three feet from a big stove like      Pappa Bear. It must fireproof and sturdy but needn't be      permanent. A hinged lamb creep or sections of low hog pen      can be cut to fit and hinged together, then hung from      hinges or pintles on the wall at each side of the stove and      supported out front by splayed feet or pins set into holed      plates or simple drilled holes in the floor. Ask for      materials at a local feed/farm-supply store. But, draw up a      plan and have the regulating authorities sign off on it      before you carve up the floor    </p>    <p>      A better plan might be to install a fence like the one      below, made of white PVC plumbing pipe with grey styrofoam      pipe insulation as a cover. Both plastics are      "fire-resistant" in the face of open flame, but will melt      if they come in direct contact with a hot stove.    </p>    <h3>      Restoring Brightwork    </h3>    <p>      Several readers have asked if there is any way to bring      back the shine to rusty finials, worn foot rests and other      once-bright-plated ornamentation of an old stove other than      expensive nickel-plating or spraying with aluminum      ("yuck!!"-as one lady puts it) spray paint.    </p>            <p>      <strong>Posts and rails for the fence are made from PVC      pipe fabricated with 90° and 45° "T" fittings and      couplers. This is 3/4" white, cold water pressure supply      pipe. Make cuts with a hacksaw and sand quickly. Joints can      be pressed together for friction fit, glued temporarily      with automotive gasket compound, or chemically welded with      PVC cement.</strong>    </p>    <p>      We've seen quite a few stoves (usually rusted or over-fired      to the point they are no longer safe to operate) put on      display for their ornamental value, and painted with gloss-      or matte-black, aluminum and copper spray paints. Some are      decorated with hand-painted vines and flowers. A      wood-heating purist might disdain these "cast-iron flower      pots," but they can be attractive in the right setting.    </p>    <p>      Conventional paints will not hold up to stove-heat, so we      tried treating some old iron with spray paint containing      actual powdered metal. This isn't "Rustoleum" or an other      well-known brand you'll find in every hardware store, but      is made by small specialty outfits and sold in auto parts      outlets. At about $10/spray can it isn't cheap. All the      brands we tested claim to restore the shiny-bright sheen of      chrome. None actually replaces the chrome plate (which is      too hard and brilliant to replicate the soft luster of      nickel, anyway). But, over old iron they do a better job      than aluminum paint, and actually look more like nickel      than chrome. The paint will wear quickly if a painted foot      rest is used as intended, and it will gradually blacken      under intense heat. But, a respray in spring will last for      the six or eight warm months in any case.    </p>    <p>      Prepare the surface of old iron by removing rust and scale      with a grinding wheel or a spring-steel wire brush on a      powerful electric drill (be doubly sure to wear eye      protection; rusty scale in an eye can be bad trouble).      Then, to de-rust thoroughly, apply Naval Jelly (also from      the auto-parts store) according to directions. If iron is      badly pitted, you can try to smooth it with grinding wheel      or file and emery paper. Spray on several thin coats of      metal-powder paint (don't try to cover 100% of the surface      with each pass). Let dry well between coats.    </p>    <h3>      Rekindling the Romance    </h3>    <p>      Finally, Doug Santaniello of Bridewater, NH writes:    </p>    <p>      "I've checked out the draft-controlled stoves, I've studied      the firestove diagrams, I've looked at the ads for      high-performance inserts. But I kept thinking, 'What's      wrong with theses pictures?' and while reading in front of      our traditional fireplace it came to me. Every one of those      products involved fire under glass.    </p>    <p>      As a longtime woodburner, I love the efficiency and      environmental safety of these old and new alternatives to      the open hearth. But guys, that's not the point. Fireplaces      are not for efficiency but for romance-the soul-deep      satisfaction of baking directly in front of the flames and      coals. You just can't make an apples-to-apples comparison.    </p>    <p>      When we built our house, the fireplace was one of the most      brutal chores, costing many times over budget and dragging      on for months, not to mention the terrifying weight of      masonry to be hauled from basement to roof. But my wife and      I say over and over again, with the flames dancing across      the room, 'It was worth it. Every bit.’    </p>    <p>      In constructing the fireplace, I think that we've arrived      at an ideal marriage, combining the romance of the      fireplace with all the advantages of wood heat. Our      solution was to combine a wood heater and a fireplace in      the same structure. The diagram shows how we did it: a      woodstove in the basement inside the fireplace column,      venting out through a separate tile stack within the      fireplace/chimney structure.    </p>    <p>      Here are the advantages. 1. You get both a stove and a      fireplace for little additional money. If you own the stove      (we did), the extra cost is about $300. 2. You get one of      the safest possible places for a woodstove in a house (what      could be safer than a concrete box?). 3. You keep all the      mess-sawdust, ashes, smoke, insects-out of your      living area. Actually, this was my main reason for doing it      in the first place!    </p>    <p>      I had considered plumbing the stove into the hot water      heat, but found that hot-air venting is much simpler,      quickly bringing heat to the upper floors. We also get a      nice thermal-mass advantage as the woodstove heats the      masonry and concrete.    </p>    <p>      We were concerned about an untended fire downstairs, so we      use smoke and temperature detectors throughout the house.      And I've been thinking about some enhancements-an      outside air intake for the woodstove, dust and humidity      control for the air system, a temperature monitor upstairs      to let us know when to re-fuel.    </p>    <p>      But as it stands, the system works just great, giving us      the satisfaction of wood heating and light gracing our      living room.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Doug Santaniello's Fireplace/Woodstove      hybrid</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Used Stoves    </h3>    <p>      Mary Olson's Poppa Bear is the largest of the      firebrick-line "step-stoves" made by the Fisher Stove Works      of Eugene OR, before they and a lot of other makers of      airtight stoves were run out of business by state emission      controls and efficiency requirements. Some poorly-welded      early step-stoves were prone to warp (the lower, front      section of top became much hotter than the step-up at the      rear of the stove). However, late-model Fishers are some of      the finest welded-steel stoves made (guaranteed for a      lifetime-that is meaningless now, as the maker is      kaput) and will heat your house so long as you treat them      with respect. They are generally a good buy on the used      market.    </p>    <p>      Pre EPA airtight stoves such as the Fishers can produce a      greasy, noxious, creosote-laden smoke if operated in an      air-starved mode. According to EPA regulations implementing      the Clean Air Act of 1972, they may not be manufactured or      sold new in the U.S.A., but are "grandfathered"-legal      to buy, sell, own and operate as used appliances-and      may be operated nearly everywhere but a handful of cities,      coastal and valley inversion bowls where the smoke      accumulates and becomes a smog so virulent it has been      known to eat the paint off cars.    </p>    <p>      BUT, before you buy or sell, check the local building,      health (air-quality) and fire codes. Many smog-prone      jurisdictions (and a few that really don't need the      controls, but want to legislate political correctness) will      approve nothing but "government stoves." Even removing and      trying to put the stove back after remodeling can void the      grandfather clause that exempts stoves in place prior to      adoption of restrictions.    </p>    <p>      With thousands of stove models made since the 1700s, there      are no published value-comparisons that mean much. Besides,      the rule of thumb is simple; the bigger the stove's      firebox, the more fuel it can hold, the more radiating      surface it has, thus the more energy it can handle, and the      more space it can heat for up to the maximum fire-life for      any stove: about eight hours. A big 1-ton black-iron      kitchen range has the same size firebox as a lovely little      green-enameled Jotul #100 box stove. Either will heat a      cabin or a room or two, but not a whole house.    </p>    <p>      A Poppa Bear will heat the house all night long in any      weather, but can cook you if temperature outdoors is balmy.      To produce less heat in any free-breathing stove, keep the      fire small, the door open and damper all or part-way      open-for less fuel-efficiency, cleaner stack-exhaust,      but less heat. Not till you close the door so the stove is      fully airtight, and ration air flow through a partly-open      draft control in front and damper in back, do you put the      stove into high-output air-starved (and, super-smoky) mode.    </p>    <p>      Used wood stoves are advertised in country-town newspaper      Classifieds and "Want-Advertiser"-type magazines. Asking      prices for good-quality c. 1970 airtight stoves in good      operating condition range from $150 to $1200 depending on      size, construction quality, finish, age, cosmetic      condition, location (they are HEAVY) and season of the      year.    </p>    <p>      The more a stove cost originally, the more it goes for      used. Cast iron models from Canada, the U.S. and Europe are      most expensive, welded steel next, and Asian-imports made      of thin iron castings least expensive.    </p>    <p>      All genuine antiques and some superior-quality modern      stoves-such as soap-stone parlor stoves and cast-iron      cook ranges-can appreciate with age.    </p>    <p>      A large-sized U.S. iron stove such as a Vigilant from      Vermont Castings or an Irish Waterford will go for perhaps      $750. A fair price for a Taiwan import of the same      capacity, and in good (uncracked) condition would be about      $250, while a big, top-quality steel stove such as the      Fisher Poppa Bear will sell for around $500. Smaller but      still top-quality models such as the Vt. Castings Defiant      or a Fisher Mamma or Baby Bear will sell for perhaps $50 or      maybe $100 less.    </p>    <h3>      Why Sell?    </h3>    <p>      For what its worth We'd would never sell a Fisher or any      other well-designed, well-made pre-EPA airtight if we had a      barn with a vacant corner. Clean it well, coat it inside      and out with axle grease and store it till the next      fossil-fuel crisis. Sure as the sun rises in the East, gas      lines will lengthen and heating oil will double in price      some time in the future. And, sure as the sun sets in the      West, fine old low-tech heaters like the FisherBears will      become as valuable as old stoves were back during the      1970's Oil Embargo when folks were offering megabucks for      anything that would keep then warm with a wood fire.    </p>
