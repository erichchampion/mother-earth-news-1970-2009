                <p>      <strong>ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>A once-thriving movement is beginning to lose its      momentum, and our nation's mineral<br />      resources hang in the balance.</strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Sue Wainscott-Bachus</h5>        <p>      You've heard the old saw too many times already: "Americans      have been conditioned to accept a throwaway lifestyle." In      the brief flurry of environmental enthusiasm of the first      few years of the decade, many recognized that statement,      however overused, to be true, and the recycling boom was      born. An encouraging start found it difficult to stand the      test of years, and paper, plastic, and metal recycling      rates have begun to level off. It's disappointing, but not      surprising. The regimen of separating, bundling, and      disposing is made even more complicated by collection      ordinances that often defy understanding. Consumers have      little incentive to recycle because just how the external      cost of packaging is reflected in market prices is not      always clear to us. And often, market prices don't reflect      dwindling mineral supplies. Because of government funding      to mining companies, consumers have no incentive to reduce      demand soon enough to avoid economic depletion of minerals.    </p>    <p>      Mining and energy industries get large tax breaks,      depletion allowances, and other tax-supported federal      subsidies. These subsidies encourage mining and energy      industries to get virgin resources out of the ground as      quickly as possible. Low mineral prices-supported by      government funding-fail to include external costs of      mining and processing; encourage resource waste, faster      depletion, and more pollution and environmental      degradation.    </p>    <p>      By contrast, recycling industries get few tax breaks and      other subsidies. Actually, the lack of large, steady      markets for recycled materials also makes recycling a risky      business. It becomes a financial venture that attracts      little investment capital. But the battle continues.    </p>        <p>      Consumers in the United States throw away enough aluminum      to rebuild the country’s airline fleet every three      months. Despite a growing market trend towards recycling      one particular aluminum product, the can, the vast majority      of this resource is still wasted. And what’s more,      the U.S. has virtually no reserves should a sudden military      or industrial need present itself. Our aluminum is      currently imported largely from Jamaica and Australia      because it is simply consumed more rapidly than domestic      supplies can keep up with. Additionally, Other countries      have higher-grad ore deposits that are cheaper to extract      than lower-grade U.S. reserves.    </p>        <p>      Plastics are made from petroleum and natural gas. They      account for about 7 percent of the weight of municipal      solid waste in the United States. They are the      fastest-growing type of waste by weight in landfills. Most      plastics used today are either virtually nonbiodegradable      or take some 200 to 400 years to degrade in landfills.    </p>    <p>      Despite what you may have heard, only 1 percent of all      plastic wastes and 4 percent of plastic packaging is      recycled. Many plastic products today carry a label saying      they are biodegradable or recyclable. While his statement      is technically true, it is also highly misleading. Plastics      degrade very slowly in landfills, and 99 percent of all      plastic waste is not recycled.    </p>    <p>      The plastics industry runs ads promoting plastics as      recyclable. However, the main purpose of the ads is to keep      us buying more plastics. The best solution is to simply use      much less plastic in the first place, especially throwaway      items.<br />    </p>        <h3>      CARBOARD, BOXBOARD, NEWSPAPER    </h3>    <p>      Each year the average American consumes 600 pounds of      paper. Recycling that one-third of a ton of cardboard,      boxboard, and newspaper saves forests, lessens solid waste,      and reduces water and air pollution. Conservationists      estimate that at least 50 percent of the world's wastepaper      (mostly newspapers, cardboard, office paper, and      computer/copier paper) could be recycled by the end of this      century. Currently only about 25 percent is recycled in the      United States, the world's foremost paper consumer. And      that 50 percent mark is definitely obtainable. During World      War II, when paper drives and recycling were national      priorities, the U.S. recycled 45 percent of its wastepaper.    </p>        <p>      Glass is made chiefly form silica sand (silica, or silicon      dioxide), soda ash (sodium carbonate), and limestone      (calcium carbonate). In order to make glass, the glassmaker      mixes and fires a large amount of silica sand and small      amounts of soda ash, limestone, and other materials. These      other materials may be alumina (aluminum oxide), salt cake      (sodium sulfate), or lead oxide. The mixture is heated to      2,600 to 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit. When the liquid mass      cools, the final product holds our soda.    </p>        <h3>      Beware the Chasing Arrows    </h3>    <p>      Be careful if you've been under the impression that those      color-coded arrows chasing arrows in a triangle have some      kind of verifiably consistent meaning. The use of recycling      logos is unregulated, and, as more and more polls indicate      a consumer preference for "environmentally friendly"      products, the logos may be becoming as much a marketing      tool as any kind of meaningful indicator of information.    </p>    <p>      Some manufacturers use color-coded recycling logos to      indicate different percentages of recycled product      contents. The paper industry, for example, generally uses      white arrows to indicate 100 percent recycled paper      products and black arrows for products that contain some      recycled material. But you will only know how much recycled      material any product contains if the manufacturer includes      a legend indicating the percentage along with the logo. The      legend, however, is not required by law.    </p>    <p>      In 1992, the Federal Trade Commission issued a set of      guidelines for labeling and advertising "recycled,"      "recyclable," "degradable," and "environmentally friendly"      products. The FTC claims the guidelines will help prevent      false or misleading labeling. However, they are legally      unenforceable, so look for the legend.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT IS RECYCLABLE?    </h3>    <p>      Recycling or resource recovery, and reuse require less      energy and cause less pollution and land disruption than      use of virgin resources. They cut waste disposal costs and      prolong the life of landfill by reducing the volume of      waste.    </p>    <h3>      ALUMINUM    </h3>    <p>      Recyclable aluminum includes aluminum cans, aluminum foil,      aluminum pie tins, and cooling pans. Be sure to empty and      rinse containers. Keep separate from other recyclable      materials. Aluminum can be flattened to save space.    </p>    <h3>      CARDBOARD and NEWSPAPER    </h3>    <p>      Cardboard includes cardboard boxes and inserts or dividers      used for packaging. If everyone in the country recycled      their Sunday newspaper, we would save an entire forest of      500,000 trees each week. Reconstituted, cleaned, combined      with virgin fibers, and reformed into new newsprint,      newspaper has different grades and mixing them will      complicate the recycling process. No books, magazines,      glossy paper, or metal objects. NOTE: Colored inserts are      okay unless they are glossy. Keep dry, clean. and separate      from other recyclables.    </p>    <p>      Cardboard is baled, made into pulp, and cleaned before      being pressed anew. It's important to remember that      contaminants (oils, grease, and food residues) make      cardboard or boxboard unfit for recycling, and that      boxboard contaminates cardboard and vice versa.    </p>    <h3>      BOXBOARD    </h3>    <p>      Cereal, pancake, dinner mix, and cracker boxes, paper      orange juice and milk containers. Poly-coated boxboard is      also recyclable. Keep separate from other recyclable      materials.    </p>    <h3>      GLASS    </h3><p>There are three types of glass: clear, brown, and green.    Separate your glass by color. Keep in mind that the weight of    glass makes recycling expensive and some recyclers won't    accept it. Since recycled glass is remelted and formed into    new containers; you must separate it by colors: clear, brown,    and green.</p>    <h3>      STEEL    </h3>    <p>      Most commonly, canned goods are packaged in steel, and so      are containers for shoe polish, car and floor wax,      seasonings, tools, kitchen utensils, throat lozenge      containers, staples, and paper clips. Steel containers are      also called "tin" or "bimetal" cans. Returned steel is then      compacted and shredded. If you are unsure of a container's      material, grab a magnet from the fridge. If the magnet      sticks, recycle as steel. If not, it is probably aluminum.      Empty and rinse steel cans prior to disposal. Remove      labels, ends, and flatten to save space (optional).    </p>    <h3>      PLASTICS    </h3>    <p>      Plastics vary according to code numbers. Normally recyclers      accept number one, two, and six. Be sure you only buy code      numbers that are accepted by your recycler. Plastic      returned to recyclers is compacted by number code, washed,      shredded, pelletized, and reformed to new plastic      containers. Empty and rinse containers prior to disposal,      and remember to remove the lids. Check the code number on      the bottom and sort by number. Keep separate or tie by the      handles.    </p>    <h3>      Plastic Code Numbers    </h3>    <p>      1. Soda bottles, small bottled water bottles, cooking oil      containers, dishwashing soap<br />      2. One-gallon milk containers, dishwashing soap containers,      large condiment containers, vinegar containers, bleach      bottles, cleaning fluids, yogurt containers<br />      3. Barbecue sauce containers<br />      4. Waterproof bags placed on newspapers<br />      6. Polystyrene; egg cartons, meat containers, cottage      cheese containers, take-out containers    </p>    <p>      <strong>Manufacturers of our depleting resources claim      there is no demand for more environmentally sound methods      of packaging their products. To prove otherwise, readers      should write to manufacturers of the products that do not      use recyclable packaging and ask them to use packaging that      is recyclable.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>But don't stop there. Governments need to hear the      same message. An example of the government working for us      is the British Columbia paper mills. British Columbia mills      soon will be producing chlorine-free pulp, not because      papermakers want it, but because the Canadian government      demanded it!</strong>    </p>
