         <p>      <strong>SHUSWAP DIARY</strong>    </p>       <p>      <strong>Returning to the Ningunsaw Valley</strong></p>     <h5 id="byline">      by Deanna Kawatski    </h5>               <p>      <em>When Deanna Kawatski first wrote us in 1991 of her    family's homesteading adventure in the Ningunsaw Valley of    Northern British Columbia, the power and beauty of her    narrative was apparent not only to us, but happily to the    thousands of readers who asked for more and who made her    MOTHER'S most popular contributor in years. At once naive and    world-weary, Deannaâ€™s story was filled with simple    strengths. Paradise found was a hand-hewn log home built    overlooking the Ningunsaw River and days filled with the    endless chores of growing food, cutting fuel, raising two    children on $2,000 a year...and reveling in a life of utter    independence. But as it turned out, the adventure was just    beginning. Her home was lost two years ago in the wake of her    husband's departure, and in a moment her family was forced to    move back to the civilization it had struggled for so long to    be free of. Deanna's stories continued from her new suburban    home, but the note of sadness and loss in them was    unmistakable. With this, the concluding chapter of her most    recent journey, Deanna finally returns to the home she left    long ago, and begins the struggle to build again.</em></p>    <p>      For nearly three years I was unable to return.      Circumstances, cost, distance, and a deep sense of loss all      conspired to keep me from visiting my old home in the      Ningunsaw Valley. And I was scared. What would I have to      face by going back there?<br />      Fresh back from a library reading tour in the Kootenays, I      was jolted by the phone call. The new owners revealed they      were "out of here." Their offer was to sell the homestead      back to me. I said, "I'm sure you must recognize how      bizarre it is to be asked to buy my own place." "Yes,      unfortunately there's a price tag attached to everything      these days," came the terse reply. When Jay and 1 had been      together, money never was the focus of our efforts and we      lived on next to nothing. What an irony that now it should      all boil down to dollars.    </p>    <p>      Scheduled to give workshops at a Young Author's Conference      in 13 days, the trip north was nothing less than squeezed.      The four of us, including Natalia, Ben, and my new partner,      Eric, along with Charlie, the elegant sheltie, all crammed      into our Toyota Tercel. As soon as we swung north of      Kamloops, we seemed to immediately leave warm weather      behind and enter the territory where seasonal awakenings      come more slowly. We cut across country from Little Fort to      100 Mile House and encountered snowflakes flinging      themselves against the windshield. The thought of my tulips      at our new home lingered in my mind, transplanted from the      Ningunsaw- bright flames that might well flare and      fade before I got back. And Natalia had blessed me with yet      another high school-hatched virus. We both had raw throats      and swollen glands. Ben, in permanent jester hat, sat      patiently counting his Pogs with as much relish as any king      in his counting house. Nat, with her nose ring, made a      habit of stealing Ben's bubble gum and bossing him      incessantly.    </p>          <p>      Throughout the trip, I was well aware that I had a huge      task ahead. It involved sorting through our old life, and      making the major decision whether to take control of our      old valley home again or to simply let it go. To say yes,      without hesitation, would be ignoring the facts. That was      then and this is now. What we had will never be re-created      in quite the same way. But then again, the valley might      speak to me as it did those many years ago when Jay and I      first fell in love with the territory. No matter what the      outcome, our home still did, in essence, own us and it was      up to us to abide by her wishes.    </p>    <p>      I caught the enchantment on Nat's face the moment the      magnificent mountains surrounding Smithers came into view.      That afternoon, before swinging north at Kitwanga, we      pulled in for gas, and who should veer in but the new owner      on his way to the homestead to move his belongings out. He      warned of the nasty bear he had encountered between the two      hills on the valley descent. The bruin had actually swiped      at his leg.    </p>    <p>      North of Meziadin Junction, the land was still lidded with      a stubborn cap of snow. As we vibrated our way through a      maze of clearcuts, I was tempted to apologize to Eric for      the ugliness, to say "I knew it when," but what was the      point? This was part of the Cassiar Forest District, which      occupies one-sixth of the land mass of British Columbia. A      mere 3,000 people reside in the entire region. It has      become world famous for its wildlife populations of      caribou, mountain goats, Dall's sheep, Stone sheep,      grizzly, black bear, wolverine, and myriad other animals      and plants. The forestry's present plan to increase the      annual allowable cut by 6 to 10 times is both criminal and      appalling. Where should I begin to apologize?    </p>    <p>      After the children and I moved, my husband Jay had stayed      on for two years, then turned it over to the new family.      They were on their way out after only eight months. What      could force them out so soon?    </p>          <p>      At last I watched the lofty ridge of South Mountain come      into view. We parked, loaded up our packs, and feeling weak      from what I had decided was strep throat, I let the others      rush ahead. It was nearly nine o'clock in the evening by      the time I had toiled down the steep trail and stepped      through the back door. As I stood on the floor that I had      walked across thousands of times, I could not recognize my      home. The house was as dim as a cave. No longer did it      glisten with love and echo with children's voices. As      though to make a mockery of our return, a tizzy of miserly      Christmas tree lights was strung across a dusty ceiling      beam. Below, piled dead center in the room, was a large      mound of taped and labeled boxes. Great garlands of dust      were draped from beam to beam and the house smelled dead      and abandoned. Without lifeblood, it was a shell.    </p>    <p>      On the front porch, the plywood benches, painted a mud      color since I left, sat empty. So often I had rested there      in the evening and let the ivory-crowned mountain valley      cradle me for a spell. To my left, a dead Christmas tree      leaned in a white margarine bucket.    </p>    <p>      Outside the barn, I noticed with a pang that my oval flower      bed was gone. Also gone was the graceful clutch of birch      trees that had marked the point of land above the pond. I      had leaned against their tattered bark often and once      caught the sight of a great horned owl staring from one of      the top branches. He observed me for over an hour. Later,      on a walk out to the Ningunsaw River, we had been startled      to find him lying dead on the trail. Jay had stuffed him      and he had surveyed our main room ever since.    </p>    <p>      I walked back and perched on the back porch, where I      noticed the little red wheelbarrow that Natalia's father      had made her when she was two years old tipped over beside      me. The bright red paint was nearly worn away and a      substantial crack ran the length of it. The kick-sled on      which we had glided down the sparkling river sat marooned      on the grass close by. Descending a quick 40-foot decline,      I caught my breath when I saw the pond. Three stout stumps      poked above the once-deep water, in the stifling embrace of      several feet of silt. Along the center ran a stranded      stretch of grass-crazed land. Beyond was the frowzy brush      island which was once the only protrusion. Behind me in a      damp log building, the water wheel whirled on in ranting      rhythm.    </p>          <p>      I rushed along toward the spillway where I saw Natalia      running my way, sobbing her heart out "It looks so      horrible!" she wailed. And so small. She had remembered it      as a much larger place. Together we pushed on to the      garden. Bands of tulips speared the soil here and there      amongst the matted spread of grass, but the expanse on      which we had once grown most of our food had gone      untilled...for years it seemed. Ben burst through the      fringe of alder and joined Natalia and me. As I embraced      him his chest heaved with sobbing. Although what he wailed      was, "My Archie comics are all gone!" I think what was      hitting him full force for the first time was the loss of      this life. I suspect that when we left, a light went out.    </p>    <p>      When I climbed the hill and reluctantly went back inside, I      was amazed to find so much of myself strewn about the      shambles of what had once been a warm and vibrant home. In      the entryway, the herbs that I had dried still sat in      gallon jars, opaque with time and neglect-dried      parsley, oregano, zucchini, mint, sage, rose hips, and      more. My fancy Findlay oval wood cookstove, in which I had      baked scores of pies, cakes, batches of bread, muffins, and      other delectables, was overgrown with a thick coat of dust      and grime.    </p>    <p>      In the next room Ben recognized his solar-powered      helicopter high on a shelf, while on the windowsill, a      dusty wooden dancing man in red shirt and blue pants leaned      a sharp left. His right leg was missing from the knee down.      Buckets and boxes were stacked everywhere. Over the scene      still stared the great horned owl, his expression holding      no patience for the antics of human beings.    </p>            <p>      Upstairs I got my worst blow of all. What had once been my      sanctuary was now unrecognizable. Cupboard doors were swung      open and spewing mounds of clothing. It was impossible to      cross the room without wading through them. Beneath a thick      gray rind of dust, my books still lined the shelves. I had      carted many of these volumes halfway around the world and      back and they had become as firmly planted in the Ningunsaw      Valley as I myself had been. Even now after nearly three      years, the act of taking my personal belongings seemed      somehow a sacrilege. I had poured so many years into this      home that the retrieving of any item felt like the      desecration of a monument. Yet there was a substantial leak      in this ship, and I had better start plucking what I wanted      from the water.    </p>    <p>      The next morning I awoke to the sound of a red-breasted      sapsucker drumming on the house while the plaintive      two-note piping of a varied thrush gently woke the woods to      another day. And we had so little time. A mere five days      was not long enough to restore order to our old home.      However, some things I couldn't stand for more than a day.      My kitchen window, which I used to define as framed with      sunshine because of its coat of yellow paint, looked sadly      myopic with its plug of spattered plastic. All of it,      including sill and wing windows, was filthy. Once Eric had      maneuvered the plastic frame out of its hold and I had      mixed up water and vinegar, I began, just as in the past,      to wash the window, sensing at my shoulder the arrival of a      red rufous, hovering like a beggar beside the feeder.    </p>    <p>      Upstairs, Natalia and Ben dove into action, rummaging      through the ruins of their former life looking for      treasures. Nat had remembered vividly some of the clothing      I had left behind, including a tiger-striped skirt and wide      cape purchased in Edinburgh. With delight she discovered a      beige shawl I had crocheted in Paris and the antique eyelet      lace blouse I had bought there. She waltzed down the stairs      wearing the hooded monk dress I had bought and worn in      Israel. Natalia and Ben both poked their heads out of the      tiny attic window and waved hello to Eric and me, standing      far below beside the woodshed. Ben sported a paisley shirt      and vest that had once belonged to his dad. He said all he      needed now was a tie and decent suit jacket and his outfit      would be complete.    </p>    <p>      Despite the dismay over the state of our old home, many      small surprises shone forth from the rubble. I found a few      surviving pansies in the garden. Natalia lit on a folder of      drawings I had saved from her earliest years. And for two      consecutive nights we stepped out into the yard and saw the      pulsing of northern lights. It was more like a prelude than      a full dancing display, but it helped me recall some of the      magic of this valley.    </p>       <p>      On the back shelf I found a final jar of "Fritz's leg" that      I had canned, from the gift of a hind quarter of moose meat      given to us by a friend of the same name. I scrounged      enough garlic dregs from a shriveled tangle to accompany      it. As the four of us sat around the scruffier pine table      with a candle glowing in the middle, eating plump plates of      potatoes, carrots, and moose, it all seemed like a dream.    </p>    <p>      The surprises continued that night when Natalia and I were      standing on the front porch. It must have been at least      eleven because darkness didn't descend until after ten.      Waving the flashlight in an arc across the clearing, Nat      said, "Let's see if we can find any eyes." At first it      revealed only darkened garden meadow. Then eerily, in the      far west corner, past the untended rows of strawberries,      the light ignited two fluorescent globes. "Maybe it's      Pippin," Nat breathed. She had missed her pet, and a photo      of the feral cat had been tacked on our wall at Shuswap      Lake ever since we moved there in 1992. In unison we began      to call her. The glowing eyes traveled closer, hesitated,      then continued towards us. We still couldn't make out a      body, but the eyes coursed up the hill through the old barn      site, past our outhouse, and up the ramp. Natalia held her      breath as at last we caught sight of Pippin's fuzzy form.      After almost three years it was like an apparition to see      Nat's pet dance toward us. As she advanced to the top of      the ramp the light caught the essence of bush cat, and in      the eyes, the touch of wildness which had sustained her.      Just when Nat bent down to pet her, Pippin turned and      dashed down the hillside. "Cats don't remember people      anyway," she moaned.    </p>    <p>      Happily, the next morning Natalia discovered that sitting      still and letting Pippin make the advances was the best      strategy. At last she gratefully scooped her up and hugged      her. Apart from the white bib, Pippin had the eyes and      coloring of an owl. A robust bush cat, she was also as soft      as a lynx. Random squirrel tails on the path and the      screams of an unfortunate red-breasted sapsucker attested      to the fact that she could look after herself. Without a      doubt, she would travel south to Shuswap with us.    </p>    <p>      What a treat it was to be, once again, far away from      traffic and telephones. As I rested on the front porch, a      robin chirped persistently from the alder thicket bordering      Natty Creek while a winter wren delivered an elaborate      solo. This was the fourteenth spring I had welcomed to the      Ningunsaw. And what did the valley have to say to me? At      first, nothing. Then the slow glowing awareness that I was      ready to reclaim what I had never truly given away. It      would mean much negotiation. We would need to find renters,      but we also needed to be able to return.    </p>    <p>      On our final pack-laden ascent up the brutal hill, I spied      the early arrival of the Calypso bulbosa. It had been an      annual ritual for us to greet the delicate purple, yellow,      and white lady's slippers. As always, I knelt and inhaled      the rich fragrance. Puffing, Nat packed a bulging bag of      clothing plus Pippin in a wooden cage. Ben lugged a giant      bag full of his freshly found <em>Archies</em> . Our      burdens were lightened by the understanding that if justice      was to play any kind of prominent role, then the homestead      would be returned to us. It would be a long road.<br />    </p>
