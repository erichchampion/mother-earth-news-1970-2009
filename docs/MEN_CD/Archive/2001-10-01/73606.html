        <p>Use a meat baster to "squeeze" your pancake batter onto the hot griddle and you'll get perfectly shaped pancakes every time. Here are some more useful kitchen tips:</p><p>• Run your hands under cold water before pressing Rice Krispies Treats in the pan and the marshmallow won't stick to your hands.<br />• To get the most out of fresh lemons, bring them to room temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing.<br />• To easily remove burned food from your skillet, simply add a drop or two of. dish soap and enough water to cover the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil on the stovetop.<br />• Spray your plastic storage containers with nonstick cooking spray before storing tomato-based sauces to prevent stains.<br />• Place a slice of apple in hardened brown sugar to soften it.<br />• When boiling corn on the cob, add a pinch of sugar to bring out the corn's natural sweetness.<br />• If you have a problem opening jars, try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a no-slip grip.</p><p>Janet Nyfeler<br />Carbondale, Kansas</p>
