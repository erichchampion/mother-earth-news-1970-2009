        Next time you fly, ask for a window seat so you can watch for theseoptical atmospheric effects described by Les Cowley, atmosphericoptics expert. <br /><br />On the side of the plane opposite the sun, you may be able to spota <i>glory</i>, or bright white glow surrounded by one or moreshimmering rings of color. This can be seen only if there areclouds beneath the plane, since the glory surrounds the shadow ofthe plane within the clouds.<br /><br />'These rings are formed when light is scattered backwards byindividual water droplets in the cloud,' says Cowley.<br /><br />A second phenomenon visible from that side of the airplane iscalled an <i>opposition effect</i>, which is a bright patch oflight moving along the ground below you. This spot is the pointwhere the shadow of the plane is hidden beneath the plane itself,so the area looks brighter than its surroundings.<br /><br />On the sunward side of the plane, ice halos and sub horizon halosare visible. Ice halos 'are rings and arcs of light caused by icecrystals in high clouds ... often rainbow-colored' Cowleysays.<br /><br />Sub horizon halos are bright lights that are a direct reflection ofthe sun from millions of flat ice crystals floating in theclouds.<br /><br />If you happen to be flying during sunrise or sunset, make sure towatch. Cowley says 'the speed of the aircraft can make them fasteror slower than usual.'<br /><br />For pictures of these sights, visit Cowley's Web site<a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk" target="_blank">AtmosphericOptics</a>.
