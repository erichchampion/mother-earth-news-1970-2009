        Even the most energy illiterate of us know that turning up thethermostat a few degrees in the summer can make a difference, butdid you know that there are approximately 30 additional ways tosave on air-conditioning costs? Try combining a ceiling fan withthe AC; increasing air flow will create an indoor wind-chilleffect. Close shades during the day or landscape accordingly nearwindows that receive sun in the afternoon. Keep the thermostat outof direct sunlight and away from heat-generating appliances. Closevents in unused rooms. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />You can get a detailed plan for your home in The Home Energy Diet:How to Save Money by Making Your House Energy Smart. Author PaulScheckel, a Vermont energy auditor, has visited thousands of homesover the past 12 years, educating owners about energy efficiencyand indoor air quality.<br /><br />This <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> 'Book for Wiser Living' provides readerswith detailed directions on how to reduce the amount of energy theyconsume. It includes lessons on how common household systems (hotwater heaters, heating/air conditioning systems and householdappliances) use energy, but more importantly, how they lose energythrough inefficiency, and what you can do to minimize suchlosses.<br /><br />The book spells out a 'diet' for each system. For instance, the'electrical diet' lists 16 tips, including:<br /><br />?Call your power company and ask if they provide an energy auditservice. Older homes can often reduce energy bills by 50% or moreby implementing energy audit recommendations.<br />?Use only compact florescent light bulbs (CFLs). For every 1,000kilowatt hours (kWh) used by a conventional, incandescent lightbulb, a CFL bulb will use only 333 kWh, reducing your lightingcosts by one-third.<br />?Know what is on, when and why.<br />?Eliminate your phantom loads (phantom loads are energy 'leaks'from appliances, like those with a digital clock display, that drawsmall amounts of power even when not in use) by using power stripswith on/off switches. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates thatphantom loads add up to nearly 10 percent of U.S. householdelectricity use, or approximately $4 billion per year.<br /><br />Check out the hot water diet, refrigerator and freezer diet,heating diet, and more. Find ways to reduce energy waste andmaximize your home's energy efficiency. Your savings account ? notto mention our planet ? will benefit.<br />
