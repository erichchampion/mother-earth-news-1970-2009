                <p>      SEASONS OF THE GARDEN    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by GREG AND PAT WILLIAMS    </h5>        <p>      YOU WON'T FIND WARNING LABELS on purchased trees and      shrubs, but perhaps you should. The once-rare fungal      infection called sporotrichosis has become a major concern      to the nursery industry. Last year there were outbreaks of      this potentially serious disease in 14 states.    </p>    <p>      The fungus that causes sporotrichosis can contaminate      sphagnum moss and then enter the victim's bloodstream via      small puncture wounds. Handling sharp-needled conifers is      thus riskier than handling deciduous plants; still, you      should wear gloves to protect against wounds when working      with <em>any</em> plants packed in sphagnum moss.    </p>    <p>      Symptoms typically begin a week or two after infection,      with red lesions on the skin of hands and arms. More      lesions follow, and these can have discharges or can      ulcerate. Sometimes there are severe complications.      Treatment is simple-oral dosages of potassium iodide;      unfortunately, many physicians do not diagnose      sporotrichosis accurately. If you have been planting trees      or shrubs (especially prickly ones) and have skin lesions      that don't heal within a month, see your doctor and suggest      the possibility of this tree planter's disease.    </p>    <h3>      Research Briefs    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Stopping apple scab.</strong>    </p>    <p>      An Indian horticulturist reports that spraying a 5%      solution of urea, a soluble nitrogen fertilizer, on apple      trees late in the growing season (but before leaf fall) can      result in scab control comparable to that achieved by using      fungicides. Synthetic urea, made from petroleum, is      chemically identical to the urea in the animal urine, so      homemade manure tea may make a good (and non-oil-based)      substitute.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stopping strawberry mold.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Canadian researchers have found that clipping and removing      strawberry foliage can significantly reduce gray mold,      <em>Botrytis cinerea,</em> the following year (the mold      overwinters on dead leaves). It's probably best to clip      leaves late in the fall so the root systems will have time      to store abundant food reserves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Metered melons.</strong> USDA scientists have      invented a device to measure the sweetness of melons      without cutting them open. The machine measures how much      near-infrared light the fruit absorbs-the more, the      sweeter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stimulating sludge.</strong> Because municipal      sludge can be high in heavy metals and other hazardous      substances, most gardeners won't risk applying it heavily      to food crops. Now, however, Arizona University researchers      have discovered that some sludge contains plant growth      stimulators (similar to natural cytokinins) that are      effective at <em>very low</em> application rates. No one      knows how they end up in sludge.    </p>    <h3>      Gleanings    </h3>    <p>      The 366-page <em>Fruit, Berry, and Nut Inventory</em> ($19      postpaid from the Seed Savers Exchange, R.R. 3, Box 239,      Decorah, IA 52101) describes over 4,000 cultivars currently      available from 248 mail-order nurseries in the U.S. . . .
