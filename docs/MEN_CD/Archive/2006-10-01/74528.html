        <h5>Issue #218 October/November 2006</h5><h5>By David Ruigh</h5><p align="left">According to research conducted by the Agricultural Research Service, some organic ketchups contain 50 percent more lycopene than ketchup made from conventional tomatoes. Lycopene is a carotenoid, the red pigment that gives a tomato its color, and has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and several cancers. It’s actually easier for the human body to use lycopene from cooked tomato products, such as ketchup, than from fresh tomatoes. When purchasing ketchup, opt for organic, and also take note of the color - the darker the ketchup, the more lycopene it contains.</p>
