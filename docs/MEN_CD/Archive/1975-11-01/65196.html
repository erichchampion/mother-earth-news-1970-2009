                    <p>      And now - direct from England - the world's most      conscientious ecology cartoon feature. A little overstated      for our American tastes, perhaps, but full of real meat,      nonetheless. Ah, if we only had a cartoon series like this      on our side of the pond! But, since we don't, MOTHER      presents mr. Crabtree Crusades!    </p>    <p>      Man-made rot is eating at the heart of nature, we are      despoiling the heritage of our sons, our grandsons, and      their grandsons.    </p>        <p>      The balance of life and the turning of the food-energy      cycle worked perfectly in the original wilderness. It could      have run on indefinitely if man had not settled instead of      wandering, grown crops instead of hunting. When he did, he      caused great ruptures in nature's balance. But nature is      adaptable as long as her most important law is      observed-that what comes from the soil must be returned to      the soil. Over the many centuries farming man has observed      that law and nature has accepted him in partnership. This      has changed in our time. Chemical farming now takes from      the soil but does not return to the soil what it has taken.      So, year by year, the soil is made poorer, the humus      destroyed. Now we are paying the price.    </p>        <p>      The havoc that sprays cause can be assessed by looking      where they do not penetrate. The prehistoric ditch is a      deep defile, manmade in the Iron Age, 3,000 years ago. All      about it lie the ravaged farm lands, but in the ditch there      is in miniature the world that Mr. Crabtree remembers. The      scent of wild thyme is on the air and butterflies and      flowers, seldom or never to be seen outside, come in their      seasons. Cowslips an primroses bloom in April, wild orchids      come in May and JungThe ditch and all that lives in it have      been spared because has not been worthwhile for anyone to      try to turn its soil i9- to profit. It has been allowed by      that accident to fall into wilderness area, a reminder of      past beauty.    </p>
