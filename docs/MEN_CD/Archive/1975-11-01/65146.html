            		     <h5 id="byline">by DOROTHY BUCCIERI</h5>      <p>        Tomatoes-being easy to grow and high in food        value-are found in most homestead gardens . . .        including ours. Our first year in the country we set out        48 plants and had all the fruit we could eat raw, with 8        bushels left over to can for the winter. Now, there's no        trick to putting up tomatoes . . . but cooking with the        product is something else again. I pored through my        cookbooks, only to find that all the recipes I wanted to        try started out, "Take a can of tomato paste" (a        substance which my home-canned fruit didn't resemble in        any way). That spring, after a winter of watery chili and        seeds in my teeth, I packed my gourmet cookbooks off to a        rummage sale and went from farm to farm drinking coffee        and copying recipes based on the facts of country life.        Those superwomen in the woods gave freely of their        knowledge on anything from hazelnuts to beekeeping . . .        and one day, while she showed me how to cut up a chicken        for freezing, a neighbor solved my tomato problem with        the following formula:      </p>      <h3>        TOMATO CONCENTRATE      </h3>      <p>        7 quarts of tomatoes, cut in eighths<br />        7 stalks of celery<br />        4 onions<br />        7 stalks of parsley<br />        7 bay leaves<br />        4 cloves<br />        1/2 cup sugar<br />        1/4 cup of salt<br />        7 tablespoons of flour<br />        7 tablespoons of soft butter      </p>      <p>        Combine the tomatoes, celery, onions, and parsley with        the spices and boil until the vegetables are soft. Add        the sugar and put the contents of the pan through a food        mill. Then blend the salt, flour, and butter, stir the        paste into the tomato mixture, bring the concentrate to a        full boil, and can it in pint jars.      </p>      <p>        The uses of this concentrate are unlimited. You'll        probably find plenty of your own . . . but here are some        of ours to get you started:      </p>      <h3>        TOMATO SOUP      </h3>      <p>        1 pint of concentrate<br />        1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />        3 pints of milk      </p>      <p>        Warm the concentrate, add the baking soda, heat the milk        in a separate pan, and stir it into the tomato mix when        both liquids are hot.      </p>      <h3>        CLAM CHOWDER      </h3>      <p>        1 recipe of tomato soup (above)<br />        2 cups of clams<br />        1 large potato, diced<br />        1 or 2 carrots, sliced<br />        1 medium onion, chopped<br />        1 bunch of celery leaves, chopped      </p>      <p>        Mix all the ingredients and simmer the chowder 20        minutes.      </p>      <h3>        WINTER MINESTRONE      </h3>      <p>        1 pint of concentrate<br />        3 cups mixed dried beans and peas<br />        1 quart cold water<br />        1 handful of broken spaghetti<br />        1 medium onion, chopped<br />        1 clove of garlic, crushed<br />        1 tablespoon oregano      </p>      <p>        Cover the beans and peas with the water and soak them        overnight. In the morning add the other ingredients,        bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it until the        vegetables are tender.      </p>      <h3>        SWISS STEAK      </h3>      <p>        Brown a round steak, surround the meat with cut-up        potatoes, and slice a large onion over all. Sprinkle the        food with salt and pepper, pour on a pint of concentrate,        and bake the dish in a medium oven until the potatoes are        done.      </p>      <h3>        BEEF STEW      </h3>      <p>        1 pint of concentrate<br />        2 pounds of cubed beef<br />        Lard<br />        Salt<br />        1 pint of water<br />        2 large potatoes, cut up<br />        1 large onion, chopped<br />        Peas, beans, carrots, celery, or any vegetables you have      </p>      <p>        Brown the meat in a little lard, season it with salt, and        add the other ingredients. Cover the pan and simmer the        stew until the beef and vegetables are tender.      </p>      <h3>        CHILI      </h3>      <p>        1 pint of concentrate<br />        1 pound of dried beans<br />        1 quart of cold water<br />        1 quart of canned tomatoes<br />        Salt<br />        A pinch of red pepper<br />        Chili powder to taste<br />        1 large onion, chopped<br />        1 clove of garlic, crushed<br />        2 pounds of ground beef      </p>      <p>        Soak the beans in the water overnight. The following day        add the tomatoes, concentrate, salt, and spices. Fry the        onion and garlic until they're limp, add the ground beef,        brown it, and combine the meat and bean mixtures. Simmer        the chili until the beans are soft and the liquid        thickens.      </p>      <h3>        ITALIAN SAUCE      </h3>      <p>        1 pint of concentrate<br />        1 large onion, chopped<br />        1 clove of garlic, crushed<br />        1/4 cup of butter<br />        1 quart of tomatoes, put through a food mill<br />        2 tablespoons oregano<br />        Salt<br />        Pepper<br />        1 bay leaf      </p>      <p>        Fry the onion and garlic in the butter until the pieces        are limp. Add the other ingredients and simmer        everything, partly covered, for about 1 hour. I use this        sauce in all my Italian dishes. If you want chicken        cacciatore, for instance, add a handful of mushrooms to        the above recipe, pour the mixture over a browned        chicken, and bake the bird for 1 hour.      </p>
