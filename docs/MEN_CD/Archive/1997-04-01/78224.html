            		<p>Main</p>        <p>      The following ingredients can be found at either a large      supermarket in the ethnic food aisle or at a Hispanic      grocery. If you live in a rural area, plan to shop for the      ingredients the next time you visit a good-size town.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cilantro</strong> : It's often called Mexican      parsley and adds a fresh, spicy flavor to food, as well as      color. The leaves should be bright green and dry without      any slime. Store in the refrigerator in a glass with an      inch of water, and cover with a plastic bag. It will keep      for about a week.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cheese</strong> (Queso): Chihuahua is a common      melting cheese similar to Muenster or Monterey Jack. Anejo      cheese is what you see crumbled on top of your restaurant      enchiladas. It's an aged, dry cheese similar to feta that's      suitable for crumbling, not melting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Jicama:</strong> This is an ugly, tan-colored root      vegetable with a crunchy, white interior. Jicama can be      used in salads, stir-fry vegetables, or just for munching.      It first must be peeled, and will soften slightly when      cooked. Select a firm jicama, avoiding shriveled ones with      mold.,When sliced open, the interior should be moist and      sweet, not woody. (If you get a bad one, return it.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Jalapeno:</strong> This is a fat green or dark      green chile that's about 1 1/2-2" long. On the hot scale,      I'd say that it registers mediumhot, but it varies. Our      homegrown red jalapenos are much hotter than the store      variety. Always wear rubber or surgical gloves when      removing the stems and seeds from chiles. (The seeds are      the hottest part.) The chile oil doesn't wash off-I      found out after ruining a pair of contact lenses. Canned      jalapenos can be substituted but there's nothing like the      real thing. Peppers can be frozen in sealed plastic bags      for later use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Poblano:</strong> This slightly hot chile resembles      a green pepper. Look for firm poblanos without shriveled      skin or soft spots. They'll only keep about a week in the      refrigerator so roast and freeze them if you're not going      to use them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tomatillos:</strong> These are little green      tomatoes with husks-only they're really not tomatoes,      but are related to the gooseberry. Look for green      tomatillos that are firm without soft spots. It doesn't      matter if the husks are shriveled and slightly browned, but      they shouldn't smell bad. Store in a paper bag, not      plastic. Large supermarkets such as Omni carry them but if      you can't find them fresh, tomatillos do come in cans. (If      you must resort to canned, drain off the liquid and add a      pinch of sugar.)    </p>
