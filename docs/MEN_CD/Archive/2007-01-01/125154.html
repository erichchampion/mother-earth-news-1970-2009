        We all have read about the benefits of riding a bicycle instead ofdriving a car. Indeed, bicycling has many advantages besidesexercise ? you don't need gas, bicycles don't pollute, and itprovides your own cooling breeze.<br /><br />As more cities are building bike trails, many people arediscovering that bicycles are useful for more than recreation. Withthe simple addition of a rack over the rear wheel, you can use thebike for grocery shopping and other errands; such racks usuallycost $25 to $50. Add bungee cords and you can strap your briefcaseto the rack. For $40 to $150, you can add saddlebags, usuallycalled panniers, to carry two grocery bags and even a change ofclothes, if you are riding your bicycle to work.<br /><br />When you bicycle, seek out the streets least used by cars. Biketrails often are faster and more convenient because there are notraffic lights ? or the cars they control ? to slow you down. Andalways wear your helmet. It is the cheapest health insurance youcan buy.<br /><br />To read more about the benefits of bicycling and some unique usesfor bicycle power, search 'bicycling' atwww.MotherEarthNews.com.<br />
