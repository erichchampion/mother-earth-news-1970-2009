        <p>You might have noticed the new Sunday evening program on HGTV, titled <a href="http://www.livingwithed.net/" target="_blank">Living with Ed</a>. The show stars Ed Begley, Jr., actor and passionate environmentalist, whose home in Studio City, Calif. is a model of renewable energy production, recycling and sustainable living.</p><p>Begley explained how he produces energy with a bicycle each morning to make his breakfast toast. Just 10 minutes of pedaling generates enough power, stored in the batteries for his solar power system, to run the toaster.</p><p>To learn more about how to use a bicycle to make your own home power, read <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/DIY/1981_January_February/Cycle_Power" target="_blank">Cycle Power Part I: How to Build a Working Stationary Bicycle</a>, <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Alternative_Energy/1981_March_April/Cycle_Power__Part_II" target="_blank">Cycle Power Part II: How to Use a Stationary Bicycle to Generate Electricity</a> or <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/DIY/1981_May_June/Cycle_Power__Part_III" target="_blank">Cycle Power Part III: How to Use a Stationary Bicycle to Power Your Workshop</a> from the <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> archive.</p><p>Begley is certainly not the only person who’s using pedal power in their homes. <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> contributor John Gulland, for example, has posted an excellent <a href="http://www.gulland.ca/homenergy/lindabike.htm" target="_blank">Web page</a> about the pedal-powered generator he built.
