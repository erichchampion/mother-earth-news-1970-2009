        <p>Who can resist the sweet fragrance of bread baking in the oven? Plus, breads made with fresh whole-wheat flours are vastly more nutritious than white breads. Hard to believe how many nutrients are lost when wheat flour is de-germed, bleached and otherwise processed. Don’t believe me? According to the USDA, compared to unenriched white flour, whole wheat contains:</p><ul><li>4.5 times as much fiber</li><li>3 times as much iron</li><li>16 times as much vitamin E</li><li>2.5 times as much riboflavin</li><li>4 times as much niacin</li><li>7.5 times as much vitamin B6</li><li>1.6 times as much folate</li></ul><p>Here’s an excellent recipe for a supernutritious whole-wheat loaf, sent to us by Michael Rickert of Reinbeck, Iowa:</p><p><strong>Rickert’s Whole-wheat Bread</strong><br />I have baked bread for more than 30 years. I developed this recipe to get as much whole wheat as possible into a light, moist bread. I use coarse-ground wheat and high-protein, high-gluten premium whole-wheat flour from Dakota Prairie Organic Flour Co.</p><p>The keys to this recipe are the high-protein, high-gluten whole-wheat flour, the coarse-ground wheat that keeps the bread moist, and the six hours it takes for the dough to rise, absorb the moisture and build a strong yeast.</p><p>Ingredients:<br /><em>3 cups coarse-ground wheat<br />5 1/2 cups fresh whole-wheat flour<br />5 tsp yeast<br />6 1/4 cups water<br />1/2 cup honey<br />1/3 cup canola oil<br />3 tbsp ground flaxseed (optional)<br />5 tsp salt<br />About 7 to 8 cups white bread flour</em></p><p>First, mix the coarse-ground wheat, whole-wheat flour, yeast and water in a large bowl. Cover and let rise for six hours. Then, stir in the rest of the ingredients, except for the white bread flour. Add the white flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon until the dough becomes too thick to stir. Now, knead the dough, adding the remainder of the white flour.</p><p>Next, cover the dough with a towel and let it rise until it doubles, about 1 1/2 hours.</p><p>Sprinkle a little white flour on the countertop, then punch down the dough and form five equal loaves. Place one dough loaf on each end of a cookie sheet, and three dough loaves lengthwise in the middle.</p><p>Make three cuts in the top of each loaf. Let the loaves rise in a warm place until a dimple made with your finger won’t bounce back.</p><p>Last, bake at 375 degrees for about 40 minutes. After baking, place each loaf on a rack and let cool for six hours or more.</p><p>Eat one loaf, freeze one loaf and you'll still have three loaves to give as gifts.</p><p></p><hr /><h5>If you want to learn more about whole grains and all the secrets to finding the right flours to bake truly delicious whole-grain loaves, I highly recommend the book <em>Flour Power</em> by Marleeta Basey.</h5>
