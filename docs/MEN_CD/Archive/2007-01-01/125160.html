        Winter is a tough time for us all, but it can be especially hard onpets. Here are a few tips for protecting your pets thiswinter:<br /><br /><ul class="noindent"><li>Keep pets indoors as much as possible during cold weather. Likehumans, animals can get frostbite.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>If a dog stays outside for the winter, it is important toprovide an insulated home. Line the floor with cedar shavings orstraw to ensure warmth. Check water often to make sure it has notfrozen.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>If your dog begins to shiver when you're out for a walk, bringit inside immediately.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Trim the long hair on the bottom of pets' feet to prevent iceballs from forming.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Road salt and other de-icing chemicals are damaging to pets'paws, and can be hazardous if ingested; wash your pets' paws afterbeing outdoors. Use sand or a nontoxic alternative to salt whendealing with icy sidewalks.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Antifreeze is a poison, yet its sweet taste unfortunatelyattracts curious animals. Always clean any spills thoroughly. Ortry a safer alternative, such as antifreeze made with propyleneglycol.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Cats and wildlife seek shelter from warmth by crawling intoavailable covered spaces, including vehicles. Banging on the hoodof your car before starting the engine should scare out anystowaways.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Our smaller friends, such as birds, hamsters and guinea pigs,can be chilled if their cages are kept in drafty areas.
