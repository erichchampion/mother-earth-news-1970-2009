        <p>With the recent and still-developing pet food recalls, many pet owners are concerned about the contents, quality and regulation of cat and dog foods. Many are considering natural or organic pet foods, or even homemade meals for their four-legged companions.</p><p>Two authoritative books about pet food - especially the problems with conventional foods and how to find healthier alternatives - are <em>Food Pets Die for: Shocking Facts about Pet Food</em> and <em>Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</em>, both by Ann N. Martin.</p><p>Over the course of more than 15 years of research and work with federal agencies, veterinarians, pet food companies and animal-rights groups, Martin discovered a disturbing reality of conventional pet foods with chemicals, dyes and by-products, plus a near-dearth of nutritional value.</p><p>While the books' titles certainly convey the startling nature of the information found within them, they also enable pet owners to make better choices through a wealth of helpful, positive information, such as:</p><ul><li>the real diet and nutritional needs of your cat or dog, including necessary minerals, vitamins and nutrients</li><li>information on pet food companies that only use ingredients of the same quality we'd expect for our food</li><li>questions to ask about pet foods in order to evaluate your best options</li><li>vitamin and mineral supplements</li></ul><p>Martin also discusses homemade pet food and includes numerous recipes for cats and dogs, including many from veterinarians and other experts. The recipes can be tailored for pets that have allergies, are picky eaters, or are pudgy and could lose a few pounds. Here are two samples:</p><p><strong>Doggie Dinner: Spaghetti</strong><strong>with Meat Sauce</strong><br /><br /><em>8 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti, cooked and drained</em><br /><em>1 pound hamburger, fried</em><br /><em>4 medium mushrooms, cut into pieces</em><br /><em>1 medium tomato, chopped</em><br /><em>1 cup tomato juice</em><br /><br />Mix hamburger with mushrooms, celery and chopped tomato. Stir in tomato juice. Pour over spaghetti and serve warm.</p><p><strong>Kitty Breakfast</strong><br /><br /><em>1 tbsp nonfat dry milk</em><br /><em>3 medium eggs</em><br /><em>3 tbsp cottage cheese</em><br /><em>2 tbsp grated veggies or sprouts</em><br /><br />Mix the milk powder with a little water and beat with the eggs. Cook in a hot pan. When mixture is cooked, turn it over, and put the cottage cheese and veggies or sprouts on top. When this is firm, fold it over like an omelet. Cut into bite-size pieces.</p><p>Be sure to consult a veterinarian before making major changes to your pet's diet. Homemade pet foods can provide peace of mind in these confusing times, but some experts caution against them (especially for cats) as a long-term solution, especially without guidance from a veterinarian nutritionist.</p><p>To learn more about pet nutrition and how you can provide your pets with safe, healthy food, consider <em>Food Pets Die for: Shocking Facts about Pet Food</em> and <em>Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</em>.
