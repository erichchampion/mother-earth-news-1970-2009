        One of the best ways to make your yard and garden more enjoyable isto provide several spots where you can sit to rest, enjoy the view,and listen quietly to the birds and the wind. You can make asuper-simple bench by standing a couple of large log sections onend, then attaching a sturdy plank onto the log 'legs' using longgalvanized spikes or screws. (If you don't have a chain saw and biglogs available on your property, just ask a tree trimmer orfirewood cutter if they will cut the logs you need.)<br /><br />Or if you want a more stylish bench with a matching table, considerthis do-it-yourself plan inspired by the furniture at the JordonPond House restaurant in Acadia National Park on the coast ofMaine. For almost 100 years, the restaurant has been serving itsfamous tea and popovers on the lawn overlooking the spectacularscenery of Mt. Desert Island.<br /><br />Our Jordan Pond Bench and Table are designed to be easy to makewith standard lumber. There are no fancy joints, just simple cuts,standard screws and weatherproof glue to give you sturdy,long-lasting outdoor furniture. The plans for the bench and tableare just $9.95 and include drawings, instructions and a materialslist. <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=1966" target="_blank">To order the plans clickhere.</a><br /><br />If you've built your own garden bench or table, share yourexperiences by posting a comment below.<br />
