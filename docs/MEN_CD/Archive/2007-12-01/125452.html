        <p>When it comes to removing snow and ice from your driveway manypeople turn to salt. But salt can damage soil and plants,contaminate groundwater, and corrode driveways, car bodies and evenhousehold floors.</p><br /><p>The most sustainable way to de-ice your car or driveway is tophysically shovel or scrape the wintery mix away. There are severalother remedies that do not include harmful chemicals or too muchback-breaking work.</p><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>To help clear your windshield, fill windshield wiper reservoirwith one part water and two parts vinegar or use water and rubbingalcohol. Then make sure your windshield wipers are in workingcondition.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Spray or pour lukewarm (NOT hot) water over thewindshield.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Cover the windshield with the vinegar and water mixture to helpprevent ice buildup.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Cover the windshield with a rug or scrap piece of carpet thenight before snow or ice.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Hire someone to shovel your driveway.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p>Other ice melting products are available but can be harmful tothe environment, children and pets, so be sure to read the label.Many of the pellets you put down on the driveway to melt the ice,such as<a href="http://www.scotwoodindustries.com/pageprodprestonedrivewayheat.htm" target="_blank">Driveway Heat</a>, contain chemicals that are considered to benontoxic if used correctly but are still just as harmful as salt.Children and pets are especially at risk because these productsheat up ? some to 175 degrees ? to break the ice away from thedriveway. Pets can get the pellets stuck in their paws and end upburnt, or worse, ingesting them. The same is true for children.Anything you track onto your carpet can end up in children's eyesor mouths.</p><br /><p>Some<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2003-12-01/Safer-De-icing-Chemicals.aspx" target="_blank">chemicals</a> are less harmful to the environment and your family.<a href="http://www.safepaw.com/" target="_blank">Safe Paw</a> makes an ice meltingproduct that is specifically designed to keep children and petssafe.<a href="http://www.cryotech.com/products/E36/environment.php" target="_blank">CryotechE36</a> is acetate-based and is considered nontoxic. Calciummagnesium acetate (CMA) is a better alternative to salt, but canstill be harmful to the environment. The key is the amount ofrainfall. The area affected needs adequate moisture to wash thechemicals away.</p><br /><p>Some products are also available to help you<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/DIY/2003-12-01/Snowy-Solutions.aspx" target="_blank">shovel snow</a>.
