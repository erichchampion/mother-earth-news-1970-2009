        <p>Choosing a Christmas tree may not be as simple as you think.There are real trees, artificial trees and even still-living trees.So, which one of these do you choose? Here's a list of the pros andcons for each type.</p><br /><p><strong>Real Trees</strong><br />Trees produce oxygen and consume carbon dioxide, which makes themeco-friendly. According to the<a href="http://www.christmastree.org/facts.cfm" target="_blank">National ChristmasTree Association</a> over 30 million people buy real trees eachyear.<a href="http://www.doityourself.com/stry/realorartificial" target="_blank">Doityourself.com</a>states that for every tree harvested there are three more that areplanted each year. A real tree can also be<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/issues/motherearthliving/nature/Christmas-Tree-Recycling_326-1.html" target="_blank">recycled</a>. Many trees are thrown into lakes, giving fish anatural habitat, or they're turned into mulch.</p><br /><p>That all might sound good, but there is a downside. Not all ofthe trees are found locally. Transportation is still part of theprocess and may counter the other benefits. Buying locally canhelp. Many farms also use pesticides so you will want to find acertified organic tree farm in your area.<a href="http://www.greenpromise.com/lifestyle/holiday/organic-christmas-trees.php" target="_blank">Green Promise</a> publishes a<a href="http://www.greenpromise.com/resources/organic-christmas-trees.php" target="_blank">list</a> of organic tree farms.<a href="http://www.pugetsoundfresh.org/" target="_blank">Puget Sound Fresh</a>also lists local farmers markets and farms that have trees. Localco-ops, natural grocery stores and farmers markets may also havelistings for organic trees. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) isanother type of farm management system. These are not asenvironmentally friendly as organic farms but are better thanconventional farms that routinely spray trees.</p><br /><p><strong>Fake Trees<br /></strong>About 70 percent of peoplebought an<a href="http://www.christmastree.org/faketrees.cfm" target="_blank">artificialtree</a> last year, despite the fact that they are made frompolyvinyl chloride (PVC) and metals.<a href="http://www.pvcfree.org/" target="_blank">PVC</a> is a potential source ofhazardous lead. Most, about 85 percent, are imported from China.Many even contain warnings about the products used in them.Artificial trees are not biodegradable so they will stay inlandfills for years to come.</p><br /><p>One eco-friendly aspect of these trees is that they can bereused year after year. On average, they are used for five to 10years. One<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/homestyle/11/06/xmas.trees.ap/" target="_blank">CNN report</a> claims that some parts of an artificial tree may berecycled, depending on what the tree is made of. Check on how thetree was made and packaged before buying.<a href="http://www.balsamhill.com/" target="_blank">Balsam Hill</a> makesartificial trees that contain less PVC than most fake trees. Youcould also consider an aluminum tree.</p><br /><p><strong>Live Trees<br /></strong>The first thing to considerwith a live tree is if you can handle<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/1994-12-01/Keep-a-Living-Christmas-Tree.aspx" target="_blank">planting a tree</a>. Potted trees will need a lot of care tosurvive until being planted. Many trees will not be able to liveindoors until spring when the ground has thawed. Do a littleresearch to find a species native to your area that can survive ina container for several months. Check with your local greenhousefor the best options.</p><br /><p>There is always the option of getting a potted tabletop treethat could be planted in your yard or a local park.
