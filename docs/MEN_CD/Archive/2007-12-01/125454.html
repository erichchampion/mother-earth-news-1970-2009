        <p>You've heard of global warming and carbon offsets, but have youever wondered about the connection and what you can do aboutit?</p><br /><p>'Carbon emissions' refers to the carbon dioxide that's releasedinto the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels. The carbondioxide becomes trapped, allowing more of the heat from the sun toremain in Earth's atmosphere. An excess of carbon dioxide occurswhen more emissions are released into the atmosphere than can beconsumed by CO2-absorbing forests and oceans, also known as carbonsinks. Elevated CO2 levels in natural ocean sinks are alreadykilling reefs, fish and other ocean life. And as the build-upincreases, atmospheric temperatures rise ? i.e. global warming ?which causes extreme temperatures (hot and cold), increasesflooding and expands desert areas, and causes more intense weatherdisasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes.</p><br /><p>Burning fossil fuels in cars, planes, homes, factories and powerplants is the largest contributor to global warming today ? whichis why smart driving, energy efficiency and reduced use ofnonrenewable energy sources are key factors in fighting climatechange. Doing your part to combat unnatural climate change is madesimple by tallying your personal carbon emissions, then making aplan to reduce the amount.</p><br /><p>Fortunately, calculating your carbon footprint is easy. Thereare a number of Web sites that offer carbon calculators forindividuals, businesses and organizations ? you can even determinethe emissions for a specific event, such as a wedding ? and ittakes just a couple minutes. Here are just a few:</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency</a><br /><a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/carboncalculator" target="_blank">Climate Crisis</a><br /><a href="http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator" target="_blank">SafeClimate</a></p><br /><p>Emissions are determined based on the size of your home, numberof residents, driving (car size and mileage) and other factors suchas whether or not you use<a href="http://www.energystar.gov/" target="_blank">EnergyStar</a> appliances.Most calculators require basic information, though it helps to haveyour annual estimated mileage and average energy use available (inkWh, therms or gallons, if you use electricity, natural gas orheating oil, respectively). You can find monthly fuel usage numberson your regular utility bill.</p><br /><p>There are a number of ways to cut down carbon emissions,including carpooling, regular car maintenance, flying less,combining trips, making your home more energy efficient andswitching to renewable energy sources, among others. According toSafeClimate, the average American produces 9.44 tons of carbondioxide annually. That's the emissions equivalent of cutting andburning all of the trees that would fit in a football field-sizedswath of the Amazon rainforest. Once you've found your number,you'll know just how much you need to whittle down. Manycalculators tell you where you use the most energy and provide tipsfor lowering your use.</p><br /><p>You can find great tips for reducing your carbon footprint athome<a href="http://www.carbonfund.org/site/pages/save_energy" target="_blank">here</a>and<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/issues/motherearthliving/green_home/reduce-your-heating-bills-how-to-find-and-seal-air-leaks_766-1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
