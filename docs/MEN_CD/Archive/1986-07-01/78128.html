                    <h5 id="byline">      By Lance Sterling    </h5>        <p>      There are a good many reasons why squirrels are among the      most hunted animals in North America. For one thing, the      bushytail season usually opens before those for larger      animals do, and provides an excuse to enjoy the      early-autumn woods. Then too, squirrels are more numerous      than any other huntable animal except possibly rabbits.      Because of this, productive woods are often accessible to      youngsters who have to be able to reach their hunting areas      by foot. The weapons used for squirrel hunting-and      the skills required-also demand less of an investment      on the part of beginners, be they young or old. And,      finally, squirrel meat has been recognized as a delicious      food since long before the first Europeans settled on our      shores.    </p>    <p>      The best way to locate a good squirrel woods is simply to      <em>be in</em> the country-hiking, camping, or      fishing-before the season begins. Listen for the      barks and chatters of those often vocal animals, and keep      your eyes peeled for nests and for the gnawed nut shells,      pinecones, corncobs, or fungi that indicate squirrels have      been feeding.    </p>    <p>      Once you've located a spot and the season opens (in some      parts of the country, squirrels are fair game year-round),      your hunt can be as simple or as complicated as you'd like.      The back-to-basics approach is simply to dress in      comfortable clothes (with a blaze orange vest, in orange      camouflage pattern if you prefer, for safety) and set      yourself down in a likely-looking grove of trees. The      early- to mid-morning and mid- to late-afternoon hours are      often the most productive. (Be sure to get permission to      hunt if the woods are on private land.)    </p>        <p>      Most squirrel hunters use either a .22 rifle or a shotgun.      If you choose the latter, which will make it possible to      shoot running animals, I'd recommend nothing smaller than      No. 6 shot. Despite their size, squirrels are hard to kill;      for that reason, hunters using a .22 should never shoot at      a moving animal, and should always use hard-hitting      hollow-point bullets. To do otherwise is to risk watching a      wounded animal escape. In any hunting you owe it to your      quarry not to shoot unless you're confident of a quick,      clean kill.    </p>    <p>      A variation of the sit-and-wait technique is still-hunting,      which involves moving slowly and quietly through the woods,      stopping in likely spots for up to half an hour at a time,      and keeping your eyes and ears peeled.    </p>    <p>      Or if you want to get complicated, you can use a call to      locate your game, or even invest in a trained squirrel dog      (called a feist dog in the South), which will tree      squirrels <em>and</em> circle the tree to force a hidden      animal to give its position away.    </p>    <p>      Whatever method you use, keep in mind that a hunted      squirrel <em>can</em> remain motionless, and all but      invisible, for hours at a time. If you find yourself      searching fruitlessly for a squirrel that suddenly      disappears, you can follow several courses of action.      First, if there's any breeze, look for the movement of      blowing fur rather than trying to spot the whole animal. Or      if you're with a friend, one of you can sit still while the      other circles the tree noisily, perhaps causing the      squirrel to move around the trunk to keep the tree between      it and the more obvious hunter. If alone, you can try      hanging your coat from a limb in view of the tree, then      circling the trunk yourself. In fleeing you, the animal may      think it's exposed itself to another hunter (the coat), and      scoot into your view. Or, finally, you can just plunk      yourself down and try to wait the squirrel out. It might      take a long time, and you might even run out of day before      that squirrel shows itself, but if you've never spent an      afternoon sitting motionless in the woods, I can guarantee      that you'll see and hear things that are every bit as      rewarding as bringing a squirrel home for the pot!    </p>
