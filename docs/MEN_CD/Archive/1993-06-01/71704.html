                <p>      <strong>SEASONS</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Fred Schad    </h5>    <p>      <strong>A remarkable meeting of planets is coming to an      area near you.</strong>    </p>        <p>      I try to speak as an advocate for each season. Perhaps as      you read this you're wiping the sweat from your brow and      feeling enervated by yet another summer day of heat and      humidity. If so, cheer up June and July are months of roses      and berries, weddings and vacations, the living world at      the height of its life. According to author Guy Ottewell,      summer has a historic importance as well. Here's what he      has to say in <em>The Astronomical Companion</em>      (Astronomical Workshop; 1986): <em>"Summer</em> seems to be      the oldest word [of the four names of the seasons in      English], traceable back to the proto-Indo-European, and      used not only for half the year but for a whole year, much      as <em>day</em> stands for the day-night cycle; and we      still understand such phrases as `Many summers ago ....'      The cycle is counted by its peaks, its recurrent flashes of      light." Summer is the peak by which we count and remember      the year.			</p>			<p>			 <strong>Seasons and Calendar</strong>			 </p>			 <p>      What marks the beginning of summer? Some may believe it's      the annual dragging out of the barbeque grill. Others may      feel it's the first dip in the local lake. In the most      technical terms, however, the answer is "summer solstice."      This is the time in Earth's year-long orbit when the      northern half of our planet is most tilted towards the Sun.      Thus, even though Earth is a little farther from the Sun in      July than in January (see page 20 for almanac's "aphelion"      on July 4), that isn't as important to us in the Northern      Hemisphere as the fact that we are more tilted towards the      Sun. Being more tilted means the Sun passes higher in our      sky, making days longer. Unfortunately it also means the      amount of solar radiation we receive is much greater.     </p>        <p>      <strong>Diagrams for dusk and dawn show scenes about      45-minutes after sunset or before sunrise,as viewed from      40' north latitude (approximately correct for the United      States or southern Canada). "Age" of the moon is amount of      time since New Moon.</strong>			</p>			<p>			<strong>-Adapted from      Sky Calendar, Abrams Planetarium, Michigan State      University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824.</strong>			</p>			<p>      <strong>Summer's Tributes</strong>			</p>			<p>			 Summer solstice was once      considered the middle of summer and is the longest day of      the year (although weather systems lag and July does tend      to be hotter than June). Although the solstice now usually      falls on June 21, long ago Midsummer's Day was celebrated      on June 24, which the Church held to be St. John's Day, the      birthday of John the Baptist. June 23 was Midsummer's Eve,      which was celebrated with great bonfires on hills in      England.</p><p> There is an interesting plant, or family of      plants, associated with John the Baptist and his day. They      are called St. Johnsworts and are found throughout the      United States, most commonly in the eastern half of the      country. They range in height from approximately four      inches to six feet tall and display five-petaled yellow      flowers with a spray of stamens in the middle.</p><p> In much of      our country they really do start blooming around the summer      solstice. These hardy plants, which also grow in Asia and      Europe, were once considered effective in warding off      witches and other evils. In her book, Naming Nature      (Penguin Books; 1992), writer Mary Blocksma says that the      St. Johnsworts of Michigan have a local reputation as a      cure-all, and some Native Americans dry the plants to use      as herbal remedies.</p><p> The flowers supposedly turn purple when      boiled, and the best way to distinguish them from other      five-petaled yellow flowers which bloom at that same time      is to look at their leaves-many St. Johnsworts have tiny      transparent dots on their leaves.     </p>		 <p> <strong>Weather</strong>		 </p>		 <p>      If you love loud thunderstorms and great streaks of      lightening, summer is the season for you. June and July are      famous for their spectacular and beautiful storms.      Unfortunately, with the thrill of a truly powerful storm      also comes plenty of potential danger; always seek the      indoors when a thunderstorm gets too near.</p><p> You can estimate      the distance of lightning by counting the number of seconds      between the time of its flash and the time you hear the      thunder it produces: Thunder, remember, is the sound of      lightning. The tremendous and sudden heat from lightening      causes the air to expand rapidly and produce a boom or      rumble. But light is enormously faster than sound. So if      lightning occurs five miles away, we see it virtually      instantly-but the thunder from it will take a number of      seconds to reach us.</p><p> The basic rule of thumb is      approximately five seconds for each mile (count:      one-thousand and one, one thousand and two, etc.). So if      you see lightning and then hear thunder from it 15 seconds      later, then the lightning distance equals 15 divided by      five, or three miles away which is near enough for you to      step back into the house. Thoreau once wrote of thunder,      "Now is Nature's grandest voice heard."</p><p> But from how far      away can this grandest voice be heard? The answer may      surprise you. Even at home in New Jersey, with a crowded      landscape and thunderstorms weaker than the monsters of the      Midwest, I have heard thunder from lightening over 20 miles      distant. But some years ago, I visited a meteorologist      friend who was working with a weather radar in North      Dakota. One July night we used the radar to help prove we      were hearing thunder from awesome lightening ...it was 50      miles away!			</p>			<p>			<strong>Astronomy</strong>			</p>			<p>      June and July 1993 bring a total lunar eclipse to some of      MOTHER'S readers. Those of us with telescopes and good star      charts (found in astronomy-oriented magazines and journals)      can find distant Uranus and Neptune at their best. And all      of us get a chance to see summer stars and a striking      pairing of Mars and a star. The lunar eclipse occurs on the      morning of June 4, 1993. Sadly, the Moon will set and day      will come before most of the country can view more than the      partial phases</p><p> (see entry in almanac, at left). Even on the      Pacific Coast, total eclipse begins just before moonset and      sunrise, with the Moon disappearing in bright twilight.</p><p>      Only observers in Hawaii will be treated to the entire 96      minutes of totality, one of the longest lunar eclipses of      the century. But don't feel left out-the whole country gets      a good look at the next total lunar eclipse, which will      take place this November.</p><p> A remarkable conjunction      (meeting) of Mars and the heart-star of Leo, Regulus, is      visible all over the world on June 21 and 22. Mars shines      almost exactly as bright as Regulus in the west for a few      hours after sunset. Jupiter, in the southwest after      nightfall, is much brighter, but you'll need binoculars to      see a little star very close to it in early June. And you      really need a telescope and finder charts to locate Uranus      and Neptune at their distant best together all night. If      you are awake either tremendously early or very late-the      hour before dawn-you will see brilliant Venus rise in the      east. For lucky rural residents, there are several      constellations to look for.</p><p> Low in the south after      nightfall, golden-orange Antares flickers as the heart of      an impressive coiling curve of stars-Scorpius the Scorpion.      High in the south or southwest shines the very bright star      Arcturus. The Big Dipper is getting lower in the northwest.      And when you face east you'll see the vast Summer triangle      of stars Vega (top), Altari (right), and Deneb (left).    </p>    <h3>      The Living World    </h3>    <p>      I mentioned above that the summer solstice is the official      start of summer in our calendar. But when it comes to      weather and the living world, I believe that summer starts      well before the solstice. Memorial Day, near the end of      May, is the cultural start of summer in this country (for      instance you can now officially wear white), and I think      this is closer to when the summer of weather and living      creatures begins.</p><p> For fairly sensitive nature watchers in      much of the United States, the change from spring to summer      is the most dramatic and rapid nature-wide change of the      year. You might think that changes in spring or autumn or      from winter to spring are more pronounced, but spring comes      in many fits and false starts, and both spring and autumn      are entire seasons of numerous transitions.</p><p> Summer erupts      over us in one transition-and then remains pretty much as      is. In the eastern United States this dramatic transition      to summer is probably keyed more than anything else to the      infamous Bermuda high. There will still be some cold air      masses that bring major respites from protracted spells of      hot, humid, hazy weather. But when the first Bermuda high      of late May or early June gets locked into place (an      earlier one won't quite set off the widespread magical      change), the results are amazing: the sky looks different,      the air breathes different, cicadas burst from the ground,      and fireflies first light up. Insects and flowers, which      even the hottest spring days couldn't bring forth, are now      visible everywhere.			</p>			<p>			 <strong>Almanac for June and July      1993</strong>    </p>    <p>      June    </p>    <p>      4 FULL MOON, 9:01 A.M.; total eclipse of the Moon.<br />      5 World Environment Day<br />      6 Trinity Sunday<br />      7 Snowfall and accumulation across northern New England      (1816).<br />      9 Tornado killed 90 in Worcester County, Mass.
