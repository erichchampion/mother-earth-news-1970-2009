                    <h5 id="byline">      by Kelly S. Isaac    </h5>    <p>      "Breezy" can breathe new life into your dying radio and      flashlight batteries.    </p>    <p>      Imagine using the wind to breathe new life into dying      batteries. Most battery chargers require electrical power      derived from the burning of fossil fuels. But what if you      could capture the power of a breeze and turn it into power      that could be stored until later, when you need it? Talk      about self-sufficiency and recycling rolled into one! If      you like soft energy paths, and want to break the      "throw-away" battery cycle in your home, here's a project      for you ....    </p>        		<p><strong>Some Background<br /></strong></p>    <p>      The concept of harnessing the wind to do work isn't new.      Our ancestors frequently utilized wind power to pump water,      saw wood, and grind grains. In fact, the design and      implementation of useful windmills dates back hundreds of      years. While the burning of fossil and nuclear fuels      dominates world-power production, environmental concerns      prompt us to now look seriously at "green" energy sources.      Wind is clean, free, and abundantly available. So why not      simply substitute wind power? Energy experts are quick to      point out the fact that our modern per-household power      consumption is usually much greater than the wind alone can      provide. Does that mean that wind power won't work? Quite      the contrary. Rather, our challenge is to "catch, store,      and utilize" energy from as many different sources as      possible. A little here and a little there saves money,      worry, and the Earth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Building "Breezy"</strong>    </p>    <p>      By following these simple instructions, you should easily      be able to construct this windmill in one afternoon, and be      recharging AAA through D-size batteries by evening. So      gather up your supplies (see Parts List) and follow the      instructions below. Breezy's body is constructed of 1"      diameter, schedule 21 PVC pipe. Plastic pipe was selected      for its ruggedness, availability, and especially, its cost.      You may choose to substitute schedule 40 PVC pipe for      additional durability, but it is not necessary.<br />      <br />      PVC pipe, normally used for plumbing, is easy to cut and      put together. Begin by cutting the 1" diameter PVC pipe      into the various sizes noted in the parts list. You can      mark the appropriate lengths right onto the pipe with a      pencil. (Avoid making unnecessary marks that you'll have to      clean off later.) Cutting the pipe is simple, and can be      done with a hacksaw or handsaw; make the cuts as straight      as possible. You may want to use some fingernail-polish      remover or acetone (in a well-ventilated area) to clean off      the ink labeling from the pipe. The materials needed for      Breezy are commonly available, but feel free to substitute      materials on-hand where necessary and applicable. For      example, you may choose to use different diameters of PVC      pipe. If so, you'll have to change the size of      fittings.<br />      <br />      Also, keep in mind that if you decrease the pipe's      diameter, you must scale down the overall size of the      entire unit. Next, sandpaper both ends of each previously      cut piece of PVC pipe to ensure a clean fit. Then,      following the diagram, <em>temporarily</em> assemble the      precut pieces of pipe with the appropriate fittings. Start      with one side and assemble the sail members. Don't push the      pipe pieces completely into the fittings; instead, gently      slide each piece part way into the elbow, tee, or end cap      with a back and forth motion. Next, assemble the members      and fittings of the other sail. Notice from the diagram      that this sail frame is oriented in the opposite direction.      This is critical in the function of the unit because      Breezy's sails work by "catching" the breeze and then      letting it "spill" off the back edge of the sail. With both      sail frames assembled, it's time to put together the center      vertical member and the<br />      <br />      top and bottom cross members. (Refer to Breezy Mechanical      Detail on page 65). Drill a hole in the "tee" separating      the top cross members. This hole should be X" in diameter,      and can be easily drilled with 3/4" spade bit. (Separate      the tee from the assembly before drilling it.) Also, use a      vice when drilling such a large hole; the drill bit might      grab the tee from your hand. This 3/4" hole will provide      rotor stability by allowing the mast (steel rod) to      protrude through it. Center this hole perfectly so the      windmill won't be off balance.    </p>    <p>      Making and Assembling the Sails    </p>    <p>      Breezy's sails can be made from any lightweight, but      durable material. (I sacrificed a sheet for mine.) If you      purchase new material, launder it first to avoid shrinkage      later. Then cut it into two identical pieces, 40" wide x      38" long. Turn one of the newly cut pieces wrong side out,      and fold it in half so it is now 20" wide by 38" long.      Stitch the two edges (opposite the fold) together to form      what looks like a pillowcase with open ends. This seam      should be run f" in from the cut edges. When cutting the      seam-thread, leave it longer than normal (approximately six      inches). Next, turn the material right side out and stitch      a 1/2" hem (as you would with pants) on both ends. These      hems will increase the life of your sails<br />      <br />      . Repeat this procedure with the other piece of material.      You can now glue the various pieces together. First,      recheck your prior assembly for proper fit and symmetry. If      satisfied with the temporary structure, start disconnecting      the tee (on both sides) that connects the top cross member      to the top sail members. This is necessary for sliding the      sails onto the vertical sail members; if you don't, you may      find yourself with no means to attach the seamed sail. Once      the sails are in place, begin disassembling, gluing, and      reassembling the structure one piece at a time. Use PVC      Cement, available at your local hardware store. It may drip      when applying, so protect your work surface with newspaper.      I swab the cement inside the rim of the fitting, and then      insert the piece of pipe with a quick twisting motion.      Pre-check your alignment <em>before</em> each insertion.      When you finish gluing the assembly, set it aside.    </p>    <p><strong>BREEZY BONUS While Breezy is busyharnessing the wind and		generating power, you'll know that you are using an environmentally benign    energy source. Best of all,you can count on wind as    an efficient source of energy that will last    forever.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Recharging Mechanism Assembly</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is the part of Breezy that allows for the conversion      the wind's mechanical power into stored, electrical battery      power. Breezy is self-starting, always turns the same way,      and doesn't care from which direction the wind is blowing.      Again, temporarily piece together the mechanism to check      for proper fit. Take the earlier cut pieces of pipe and      assemble as indicated in the mechanical detail. Keep in      mind that the elbow (motor shroud/enclosure) must face      toward the 4" ABS cap (rotor pulley), and be even with      it.<br />      <br />      This is so the rubber band, acting as a belt, can have one      end around the motor shaft and the other around the 4" cap.      This simple pulley arrangement has a step-up effect, which      greatly multiplies the rotor speed (40:1), and applies it      to the motor shaft. Next, remove both end caps, and with a      3/4" spade bit, drill a hole in the top center of each one.      Using a 1 1/4" spade bit, drill a hole through the center      of the 4" ABS cap, and then check all three holes for      proper clearance.<br />      <br />      The two end caps will easily slide over the main mast      (steel rod). The 4" cap should just fit around the 1" PVC      pipe. You can now begin gluing the pieces together,      starting with the pipe piece fitting into the bottom of the      four-way fitting. Next slide the 4" cap, open-side down,      over this glued piece of pipe. Apply a ring of glue around      the drilled hole in the ABS cap to secure it to the bottom      of the four way. The piece to follow should be a coupler;      glue and attach to the bottom (under the cap) of the same      piece of pipe. By pushing the coupler up against the 4"      cap, you'll secure the various pieces into a solid rotor      pulley mechanism. Make sure the 4" cap rotates with the      windmill assembly, and doesn't slip. Finish by gluing      another 2" piece of pipe into the bottom of the coupler,      and following it with an end cap having a pre-drilled 3/4"      hole.<br />      <br />      Only a few remaining pieces need PVC cement. In the      mechanical detail, study the portion of the mechanism just      below the pulley assembly. First, glue the tee into place      on the 48" piece of 1" diameter PVC pipe. This piece of      pipe is called the support mast, and provides the vertical      support for the entire assembly. It is important that the      motor enclosure be even with the rotor pulley (4" ABS cap),      so the rubber drive band won't be misaligned. The only      portion <em>not</em> requiring cement is the motor      enclosure (elbow). Last, attach the battery box opening up      to a 6"-long piece of 3/4" PVC pipe. (This is the only part      of the assembly that requires 3/4" PVC.) I found that a      plastic outlet box (located in the electrical section of      your hardware store) and cover will work nicely to      waterproof the recharging batteries.<br />      <br />      If you use this type, check the size of the opening in the      box and adjust your 6" piece of PVC to the appropriate      diameter to perfectly fit the opening. As far as the      matching cover, if you can find only one with either a      light switch or two plug-in plate, don't worry. You can use      diagonal cutters to enlarge the opening to a 2.5" by 2.5"      square (approximate measurements) to allow easy access to      your batteries. Attach the cover to the box so it opens      upward, providing more rain protection.<br />      <br />      The wind-power converter or "generator" is simply a DC      motor which is held in the top of the 5"-long PVC pipe by      several wrappings of friction tape. Wind several inches of      tape around the bottom of the motor case to allow the motor      to extend from the pipe end. Test fit it in the pipe, and      continue the process until you're sure that the motor will      stay in this position. Detail the motor enclosure elbow      (see Detail) with a 3/4"-long horizontal cut on both sides      of the horizontal segment. This will allow the drive belt      (rubber band) to extend from the motor enclosure without      touching the sides, which would make Breezy less      efficient.<br />      <br />      Cut these out with a hacksaw or on a mill so they are      slightly larger than the width of the rubber band. Next      comes the cutting and drilling of the bearing. The most      efficient material I have found for this application is      UHMW, (Ultra-High Molecular Weight) plastic. This      relatively new plastic is self-lubricating, wear-resistant,      and doesn't need to be oiled or replaced like a      ball-bearing would. The bearing should be cut from a 2"      diameter UHMW rod, and should be 1" thick. Also, a 3/4"      hole must be drilled through the center, so it can move      freely around the steel rod, or mast. This completes the      basic mechanical construction part of Breezy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Electrical Circuit</strong>    </p>    <p>      The simplest form of charging system for Breezy could be      formed by directly connecting the motor/generator to the      battery through a diode. With this system, the diode allows      power generated by the motor/generator to be applied to the      battery, but blocks any power trying to return from the      battery. Without the diode, the battery would rapidly      discharge itself back into the motor during times of low or      no wind. However,<br />      <br />      I don't recommend this charging system. With the 40:1      step-up mechanism attached to the motor/generator, voltages      as high as 10 volts can be created in high-wind conditions.      These high voltages would overcharge the 1.5 volt batteries      and could possibly damage them. Instead you will need to      add a couple of other components to limit the amount of      power made available to the battery. Refer to    </p>    <p>      <strong>Figure 2</strong>    </p>    <p>      and notice the motor/generator is connected through the 1      N4007 diode and the 51 ohm, one watt resistor, to the      battery holder. These parts are available from your local      Radio Shack store (or see Editor's Note to order parts). In      addition to the diode and resistor, a special type of      transistor (Field Effect Transistor) is utilized to limit      the amount of power in the circuit. When the windspeed      increases above the optimum level needed for charging, the      motor/generator output voltage increases above three      volts<br />      <br />      The Field Effect Transistor senses this voltage increase      and begins to dissipate the extra electrical energy as      heat. Additionally, the 51-ohm resistor limits the amount      of charging current applied to your batteries to keep them      charging properly. If the wind gusts strongly, the      transistor will continue to clamp the charging voltage      harder and harder until it eventually "slips" the rubber      drive band temporarily. This action will not harm the unit,      but rather acts like a governor on the system. The LED      (Light Emitting Diode) is an option that you can add to      Breezy that gives you a visual "OK" indication. Building      the circuit is easy. Using a small soldering iron, simply      connect the various parts. Keep your work neat and remember      that you will need to install the circuit in the battery      box later. Remember to<br />      <br />      use red wire on the positive side, black on the negative.      If not, you might <em>uncharge</em> a battery and damage      it. Using a small voltmeter, check the polarity of your      motor/generator. With the wind blowing, the rotor turning,      and the motor/generator outputting a voltage, determine      which lead or terminal is positive, and which is      negative.<br />      <br />      If you don't connect the positive side to the diode, the      unit won't charge; double-check this on your Breezy.      Congratulations, you're now done with the electrical part      as well.    </p>    <p>      Final Assembly    </p>    <p>      At last, Breezy is ready to be put to the test. Secure the      sails before taking your windmill to your chosen site.      (Move Breezy from time to time to test various sites around      your place.) Use 20-pound fishing line to hold the sails in      the proper position. This strength of fishing line provides      a high-wind safety mechanism. If the wind is too strong,      the line will break and stop the windmill from spinning. To      begin the final assembly process, drill four holes (W" in      diameter) through the top and bottom end caps. Locate the      holes, one per top and bottom, for both sails. These holes      will hold the sail in the correct position. You may need      someone to hold the sail up while you fasten it.<br />      <br />      With a needle, thread some 20-pound test fishing line from      above, through to the bottom of the top end cap. Continue      with the line down through the inside of the sail (along      the seam), through the top hole and out the lower hole on      the bottom end cap. The fishing line should be slightly      loose to allow some give in the sail, and must be knotted      on the top and bottom end caps. I knotted the line around a      small washer to help hold it in place.<br />      <br />      Next, with the same needle run a small bit of fishing line      through the sail material and over the top elbow in order      to hold the sail up on this end. Repeat the procedure to      properly position the opposite sail.</p><p><strong>THE      CHALLENGE</strong> <strong>For those interested</strong>      <strong>in using alternative</strong> <strong>energy, the      biggest</strong> <strong>challenge is to catch,</strong>      <strong>store, and utilize energy</strong> <strong>from as      many different</strong> <strong>sources as      possible.</strong> <strong>Building Breezy at home</strong>      <strong><em>is a good</em> first step</strong> .      <strong>Using Breezy<br /></strong></p><p>Take Breezy to the      operating site and begin by driving the X" rod into the      ground about 18". Be careful not to "maul" the top of the      rod too badly; the main rotor assembly must slide over the      top.<br />      <br />      With the rod in place, use a carpenter's level to make sure      the rod is perfectly vertical; Breezy must be vertical to      operate at maximum efficiency. Using a ladder, slide the      support mast assembly over the top of the rod, and push it      into the ground approximately 4". Drop the UHMW bearing      into place atop the support mast. Then, slip the rubber      drive band around the rotor pulley and ease the main rotor      assembly over the top of the rod. With the rotor assembly      resting atop the support mast and UHMW bearing, work the      rubber drive band over the motor/generator shaft. Position      the motor enclosure elbow so that the rubber drive band      operates smoothly. Guy (or steady) Breezy using<br />      <br />      "clothesline" wire and tent stakes at a ground radius of      approximately eight feet. The guy lines should hold the      support mast firmly, and keep Breezy from moving from side      to side as it rotates. I like to use three guy lines, but      you may be more comfortable with four. Well, that's it just      select a battery to charge. With a light breeze, my Breezy      takes about eight hours to fully charge a D cell that is      completely run down. Smaller C, AA, and AAA batteries will      take even less time. Experiment with your unit to determine      what works best in your area. Good luck with your Breezy      and congratulations-you've broken the "throw-away" battery      syndrome and made the world a better place.    </p>    <p>      Editor's Note: Kelly Isaac is a high school teacher and      neo-naturalist specializing in applied biology, chemistry,      and physics.
