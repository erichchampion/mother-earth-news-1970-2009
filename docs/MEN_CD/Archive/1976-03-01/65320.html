                        <h5 id="byline">      by STUART SILVESTEIN    </h5>        <p>      One skill which can come in mighty handy to just about      anyone-whether you live on OR off the farm-is glass      cutting.    </p>    <p>      Now, many homesteaders and suburbanites have taken the time      to become competent carpenters . . . but for some reason,      very few people have ever learned how to [1] find free or      inexpensive glass, and [2] cut it once it's found.    </p>    <p>      Fact is, of course, a lot of folks are intimidated by glass      because they assume it's too difficult to work with, or too      dang costly in the first place . . . neither of which is      true. Glass cutting is merely a skill that can be learned      (like tanning, canning, or composting) and the techniques      involved are not at all complicated. And anyway, it's just      a matter of time before you'll <em>need</em> to use glass      for your home, cold frame, greenhouse, solar collectors . .      . or whatever.<br />    </p>    <p>      Sure, you can substitute polyethylene. In a short time,      though, the plastic will become yellowish and brittle and      have to be replaced. Glass is all-around superior because      it's durable, it's not that costly, it's forever      transparent and-best of all-it's not made from      energy-intensive, non-recyclable materials.    </p>    <h3>      THE GLASS MENAGERIE    </h3>    <p>      Let's briefly look at some of the different kinds of glass      you'll run across:    </p>    <p>      <strong>WINDOW GLASS</strong> is the most common variety      you're likely to work with. It's available in single- and      double-weight thicknesses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLATE GLASS</strong> is both stronger and thicker      than double-strength window glass, while usually not more      than 3/8" thick.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS:</strong> Two sheets of      glass bonded together by an extremely tough, clear plastic.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MIRRORS</strong> need no introduction, but I might      point out that you can scrape the reflective backing off      most any mirror with a single-edge razor blade,      and-presto!-you'll have another see-through      pane.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE TO FIND NEW AND USED GLASS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>HARDWARE STORES</strong> usually sell window glass      only, cut to order. (Here, you might as well let them cut      the glass for you. That way, if anything gets broken, the      fault lies with them . . . not you.) While these outlets      are convenient, they are also the most expensive everyday      source of glass.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GLASS STORES</strong> specialize in window glass,      plate glass, auto glass, stained glass, or any combination      thereof. You can pick up new glass at such outlets for less      than you'd pay at a hardware store. These specialists also      are often willing to cut your purchase into some pretty      weird shapes, if you want them to.    </p>    <p>      Aside from dealing in brand-new wares, specialty stores are      also frequently a good source of inexpensive and      (sometimes) free glass. Ask if there are any seconds      available. A second could be a pane that's pitted,      scratched, or perhaps a bit distorted . . . none of which,      for all practical purposes, affects the piece's utility. If      you don't mind such imperfections, seconds offer the      purchaser a good way to save a substantial amount of      bread.<br />    </p>    <p>      Also inquire about cracked laminated satety glass. The      store's manager might think you're cracked, but actually,      damaged safety glass can be put to good use in cold frames,      greenhouses, and whatnot. (The "sandwich" material leaves      even cracked sheets of glass with enough strength so that      they'll work OK in most applications.) If your shop carries      cracked safety glass, you should be able to get it for free      . . . or nearly so, in any case. Busy shops constantly      remove such damaged panes and sheets from cars or trucks      that are having new windows installed. If your local      <em>outlet</em> doesn't carry any cracked auto      glass-and they may not-it's probably because      more and more cars today are equipped with tempered windows      which, instead of cracking when damaged, just disintegrate      into thousands of jewel-like bits and pieces.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, dealers simply don't use as much laminated      glass as they once did. Nevertheless, inquire anyway and      ask if they'll save you any odd pieces they come across      which might otherwise go in the trash.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>AUTO WRECKERS</strong> are, of course, a good      potential source of laminated safety glass-cracked or      intact-should your local glass shop not have any.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUILDING WRECKERS, SALVAGE YARDS, SECOND HAND      STORES, AND COUNTRY AUCTIONS,</strong> all are good places      to look for low-cost used glass. If you dig awhile, you're      likely to find old storm windows, sliding glass doors,      framed picture windows . . . and who knows what else.    </p>    <p>      One good way to save a bundle on glass is to seek out old      storefront windows. These plate glass wonders are usually      scratched, chipped, painted, and lettered over, but you'd      be surprised how quickly a razor blade and some paint      stripper will tidy things up . . . and the price is usually      right, if you volunteer to scrape the paint off yourself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TOWN DUMPS?</strong> Why not? Better to be down in      the dumps than to be without glass.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO CUT GLASS</strong> <strong>. . . THE RIGHT      WAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      The following basic techniques should get you through most      glass-cutting jobs. Needless to say, you should practice on      unusable bits and pieces first.    </p>    <p>      [1] Dust off the top of your cutting surface, preferably a      smooth table.    </p>    <p>      [2] Lay out all tools: oil, pliers, tape measure,      straightedge, and glass cutter. (I always use either a      Flatter or Red Devil cutter, which in my estimation are the      most reliable brands. Whatever you do, don't go in for a      combination cutting tool, screwdriver, knife sharpener, and      Lord knows what else. Just a glass cutter, please.)<br />    </p>    <p>      [3] Place the pane or sheet you want to trim or divide on      the table and be sure the area which you intend to cut is      scrupulously clean . . . no paint, dirt, putty, etc.    </p>    <p>      [4] Next, hold a straightedge against the glass and run a      thin stream of lightweight oil down the cutting line (Photo      2).<br />    </p>    <p>      [5] Now, "make your mark". Bear down firmly-but not      stiffly!-with the cutter and score the glass in one      even, sweeping motion (Photo 3). If you score the glass      properly, you'll hear a very pleasant clicking sound.      Remember, the cutter only scratches the surface . . . it      doesn't cut through. If you see little flakes of glass      flying into the air during this part of the operation, it      means that either you forgot the oil or your cutter is too      sharp or you're bearing down with the weight of      Gibraltar.<br />    </p>    <p>      [6] After you've scored-as we say in this business-go      right ahead and-snap the piece in two. (Don't wait around,      or it may not snap as cleanly.) Photos 4 through 7 show      several ways of making the break.    </p>    <p>      The whole idea of scoring is to weaken the glass by      focusing internal stresses along a single path. These      stresses are then relieved as you break the glass in two.    </p>    <p>      [7] Finally, if necessary, you should smooth the edges of      the two new panes or window lights with wet emery cloth (or      with a grinder, if one is available).    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO CUT LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS    </h3>    <p>      First score the glass on one side, and press your thumbs      firmly on the unscored side until you hear the etched side      snap. Then score and snap the other side. Finally, apply a      thin stream of lighter fluid to either cut, ignite, and      step back.<br />    </p>    <p>      When the fire has gone out, the heat will have weakened the      plastic between the layers of glass and you can cut the two      pieces apart with a razor blade.    </p>    <h3>      SOME SUGGESTIONS    </h3>    <p>      You'll find that new (that is, sharp) cutters work best on      window glass, while cutters that have been around      awhile-and no longer have their original keen edge-do best      on plate and safety glass.    </p>    <p>      A final tip: Instead of tossing away all those seemingly      unusable shards of glass which begin to accumulate, why not      read Mary Lou Stribling's <em>Art From Found</em>      <em>Materials?</em> With her ideas for glass mobiles and      mosaics, she takes the concept of recycling a      delightful-and welcome-step further.    </p>
