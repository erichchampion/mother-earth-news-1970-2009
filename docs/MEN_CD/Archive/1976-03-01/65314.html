                    <h5 id="byline">      by JIM HILBERER    </h5>        <p>      <strong>MOTHER NO. 22 featured, among other things, an      article by Lee Winchester titled, "Homesteading Capital is      Where You Find It". Jan and Jim Hilberer, however with      practically no money at all had already successfully left      the Big City behind them long before they read Lee's      thoughts! Here's a report Jim sent us in March of      1974.</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      I would like to point out that homesteading can be done      with little money, lots of hard work, and much pleasure. My      wife, Jan, and I left Rochester, New York in the spring of      1972 with $250 and our VW. Less than a year later, we were      settling into a cabin of our own on 51/2 acres of Virginia      land.    </p>    <p>      We left the city with the idea of locating inexpensive land      in West Virginia. After looking that state over and      shelling out a sizable portion of our small bankroll on VW      repairs, though, we gravitated to the northern border of      Virginia where jobs were more plentiful. Our plans at that      time were to camp out for the summer, work, and save every      penny we could toward our homestead. We weren't exactly      sure right then that we'd be able to make the idea work the      way we wanted because, although I've camped since I was a      child, Jan had never-until then-camped out in      her life.    </p>    <p>      We pulled into an attractive little campground with a      brand-new 9 X 9 tent, a Coleman stove, some lanterns, and      $70.00 left in our pockets. We liked what we saw. The      grounds had a 15-acre lake, showers, toilets, washer, and      dryer . . . not a bad home for the summer. So we chatted      with the owners and they agreed to let us stay for the      whole season for the lump sum of $100 . . . half down and      the other half due the following month.    </p>    <p>      That left us with only $20.00 to live on, so we immediately      set up camp and went looking for work. I took a job that      paid $100 a week-not much, but a good      start-that same day and Jan, a teacher, found      employment as an art instructor shortly afterwards.    </p>    <p>      I chopped all our firewood that summer with an axe and Jan      and I kept our campsite clean and neat. This industry and      our ambition soon impressed other campers who used our      grounds every weekend and we became friends with some of      these "regulars". Before long some of them were even      offering me good jobs back in the towns they'd come from .      . . but I turned them down because of the distance I would      have had to travel each day.    </p>    <p>      By the end of the summer we had come to know the owners of      the little park in which we'd spent the season so well that      we ended up buying our homestead from them. It's five and a      half acres overlooking the Shenandoah River in the Blue      Ridge Mountains. We paid $350 down and the owners financed      the balance at $65.00 a month.    </p>    <p>      The deal on our land was closed in October . . . too late      for us to put up a house for the winter. So Jan and I found      a 11 0-acre farm we could rent for $60.00 a month. Heat      wasn't included at that price, but the old farmhouse      kitchen that we'd be using was equipped with a beautiful      wood-burning stove. We bought an additional wood-burning      heater of our own, moved in, and stayed snug and warm all      winter.    </p>    <p>      Our comfort, however, only whetted our appetite even more      for a home of our own. But how would we get it? We had      nowhere near enough money to buy a house.    </p>    <p>      "Maybe we could build a home," we thought. "Maybe we could      build a log cabin." So, even though we'd had no previous      building experience, we read two books on log cabin      construction and went to work.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the building site was marked off, we paid a      'dozer operator $20.00 to push off the few trees that stood      where we wanted our new house to be. As we watched those      trees fall, one of our new neighbors came over to get      acquainted.    </p>    <p>      "Whatcha gonna build?" he asked during the course of our      conversation.    </p>    <p>      "Log cabin," we answered.<br />    </p>    <p>      "Well, I declare," he said. "I just cleared two acres of      straight pines and put me in a pasture. Now I sure got no      use for those trees. Mebbe you have."    </p>    <p>      We were happy to accept that offer and, the next day, our      new friend started dragging logs to our homestead with his      tractor. The generous gift inspired us to go right out and      buy a chain saw so we could begin cutting the rough timber      into the lengths we needed for the walls of our house. We      also picked up three drawknives for 50c apiece at an      auction . . . and, for the next three months, Jan and I      spent every weekend cutting off branches and peeling logs      out on our property.<br />    </p>    <p>      About the first of March Terry Atwater, a friend from New      York, came down to visit . . . and was so impressed at our      progress that he decided to stay and help us erect our      cabin, One month later-on April 1-we moved into      the 14 X 24 dwelling. And by May 21, our garden was in the      ground . . . which resulted in plenty of fresh vegetables      for the summer and a surplus that we canned for winter use.    </p>    <p>      Although we still have no electricity (we heat with wood      and light our home with kerosene), we have had running      water piped in to the cabin. Our monthly bills, then, are      $65.00 for a land payment and $4.00 for water.<br />    </p>    <p>      The total cost of that first cabin-including chain      saw-was $700. We built the structure in just seven months'      time and paid cash for everything we bought as we went      along. And now, with the money we've saved during the past      year, we're starting on our new 24 X 32 log cabin!    </p>
