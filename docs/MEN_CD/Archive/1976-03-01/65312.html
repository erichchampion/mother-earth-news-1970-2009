                    <h5 id="byline">     by CHET MEISNER    </h5>        <p>      Recently I met Ann Sperling, a delightful and dedicated      woman who has made a life's work of helping others stay      healthy, and who now distributes a unique vegetable cooking      parchment called Vita-Wrap. I can tell you from firsthand      experience that this parchment not only keeps those      valuable vitamins and minerals in your fresh vegetables      from escaping into the water in which they're cooked, but      it actually locks in a great deal of extra flavor and      texture that usually gets poured down the drain.    </p>    <p>      I was first introduced to Ann's vegetable parchment by two      friends as we sat in a deli one afternoon talking over the      relative merits of mild dills and pickled tomatoes. One of      my friends mentioned that she had recently made some      applesauce by using a sample of vegetable parchment that      Ann had given her. Naturally I was skeptical      because-the way she talked about making the      sauce-it sounded like she had cooked the apples right      in a sheet of paper. How preposterous! Surprise! My friend      assured me that was exactly what she had done and gave me a      few sheets of the parchment of my own to try.    </p>    <p>      I accepted the challenge. After all, if I-the world's      most average kitchen captain-could make fresh      vegetables tastier with this new parchment, then I      certainly wanted to know about it. The instructions were      simple: wet a sheet of the paper, wrap my vegetables or      fruit in it, tie off the top, and put the whole package in      boiling water. From that point I was on my own.    </p>    <p>      When I went home to prepare dinner that night I ran two      pots of boiling water and wet a piece of parchment (it      comes in twenty-four-inch-square sheets) to make it      pliable. Then I put a cup of fresh shelled peas in the      center of the sheet with a pad of fresh butter, tied the      ends up into a pouch, and dropped the package into one of      the pots of boiling water. For the sake of comparison I      poured the same amount of fresh peas directly into the      other pot of bubbling water with a pad of b utter ... and      then waited for both pans to finish cooking. The results      were surprisingly clear-cut.    </p>    <p>      The peas cooked in the vegetable parchment had a definitely      deeper green color and a fuller richer texture. None of the      water had come through the material, so the peas had cooked      only in their natural juices. By comparison, the other      batch cooked directly in boiling water-had a smoother,      almost ball-bearing texture and blander taste (presumably      because of the liquid they had soaked up by direct      osmosis). An interesting sidelight was that none of the      butter seeped through or even stained the parchment, which      I later learned was grease resistant. The pot in which the      Vita-Wrap had been used needed no scrubbing or cleaning of      any kind.    </p>    <p>      Since that first experiment I've discovered that all      vegetables (carrots, beans, cauliflower, and even small      potatoes) have a better taste and cook more rapidly when      prepared in parchment.    </p>    <p>      I've been using Ann's vegetable parchment cooking wrap ever      since (it's reusable and does not retain the odor or taste      of food prepared in it ... just hang a sheet out to dry      after each use), and recommend it to all my friends. My      thanks to Ann for making my fresh vegetables even more      enjoyable!    </p>    <p>      MOTHER'S NOTE: Although Chet didn't mention it in his      article, anyone Interested in trying Ann Sperling's cooking      parchment can order a package of three 24" X 24" sheets for      $1.98 plus 40c postage and handling from Vita-Wrap, 1995      N.E. 147th Lane, North Miami, Florida 33181.    </p>
