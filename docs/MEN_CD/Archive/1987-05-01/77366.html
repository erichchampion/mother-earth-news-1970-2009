                 <h3> The Coast Isn't Clear</h3>    <p>      Demographers predict that by 1990 three-quarters of the      U.S. population will live within 50 miles of a      coast-Pacific, Atlantic, Gulf or Great Lakes. Yet      coastal waters are already heavily burdened, says a report      in <em>Environmental Action</em> magazine (bimonthly, $20;      1525 New Hampshire Ave. N.W., Washington, DC 20036). Nearly      3.5 trillion gallons of sewage are dumped into marine      waters each year. Industrial wastes contribute a      substantial share of pollution-industries in Maryland      alone dump more than 2,763 tons of heavy metals into the      Chesapeake Bay annually. Adding to the problem are offshore      oil and gas drilling, coastal erosion caused by      construction and the dumping of materials dredged from      rivers and harbors. The sum total could spell      crisis-but at least some positive forces are at work.      Among them is the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA),      passed in 1972 to provide federal funds to states that      develop effective coastal management programs. For more      information on coastal issues and CZMA, write the Coastal      Alliance, 1001 Connecticut Ave. N.W., No. 535, Washington,      DC 20036.    </p>   <h3>Really Frozen Strawberries</h3>        <p>      In search of a fail-safe method for preserving superior      strains of food plants, scientists at the USDA's National      Clonal Germplasm Repository in Corvallis, Oregon, are      freezing strawberry shoot tips in liquid nitrogen and will      be storing them at -325Â°F for as much as 100 years. In      what has been called "the world's longest experiment," some      of the shoot tips will be removed from deep freeze after      five, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 years and (the researchers      hope) grown into whole plants. The results of preliminary      tests spanning shorter periods are encouraging: 90% of      frozen-then-thawed shoots grew into normal, full-size      specimens. If perfected, the technology could be used to      keep back-up stocks of botanical material on hand, which      could then be called upon to replace strains that might be      wiped out by disease or disaster in the future.    </p>   <h3> Methane Digesters</h3>    <p>      Scientists working near hydrocarbon seeps 150 miles off the      Louisiana coast have discovered deep-sea mussels that      eat-and derive their nourishment from-methane.      Bacteria inside the creature's gills convert the natural      gas to proteins and other life-sustaining organic      compounds. Researchers say that the mussels are the first      living organisms known to have a taste for methaneand add      that the mussels themselves taste "sweet and delicious."    </p>  <h3>In-Car Pollution</h3>    <p>      A researcher studying commuter autos on the Los Angeles      freeway during rush hour has found levels of toxic      pollutants inside cars three to five times higher than      daily levels outside. Samuel Witz of the South Coast Air      Quality Management District discovered heightened      concentrations of benzene, toluene, lead, nickel, chromium      and manganese in automobiles traveling the freeway during      peak periods. He ascribes part of the problem to deposits,      both on the pavement and on tires, stirred up by heavy      traffic and sucked in through auto ventilation systems.      Concentrations were particularly high in air-conditioned      cars driven with the windows up.    </p>    <h3>Texas Goes Local</h3>    <p>      Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim High-tower, a well-known      consumer advocate and author of <em>Eat Your Heart      Out,</em> has launched a state-wide program designed to      encourage Lone Star farmers, food processors and consumers      to keep their business at home. Over 300 Texas food      companies and four dozen retail chains now use the      program's "Taste of Texas" logo to identify their products.      "For every additional 1% of the national food-processing      market Texas captures," Hightower said recently, "the      state's economy gains an additional $3 billion in retail      sales . . . and 90,000 new jobs. For every dollar in retail      sales by a Taste of Texas company, 36 cents goes to the      Texas farmer. That's 11 cents more than the national      average and can easily mean the difference between a      producer shutting down and staying in business,.    </p>   <h3> Say It Isn't So!</h3>        <p>      Every lover of the suds knows that, despite a world awash      in chemical-tainted brew, German beer remains      pure-thanks to a 1516 law that allows only four      ingredients: hops, barley, yeast and water. Now, however,      Germany is being pressured to relax its standards by other      members of the European Economic Community, who claim that      the country's purity law discriminates against non-German      brewers and constitutes an unfair trade practice. Germany      already permits beer with preservatives and other      nonconforming ingredients to be sold within its      borders-but only if the brew is not labeled "beer."      Apparently that wasn't enough to satisfy the EEC, though.      On March 12, a 13-judge panel of the European Court in      Luxembourg ruled against West Germany. Now, unless the      Germans can show scientific evidence of harm, the additives      will be allowed in beers imported into Germany.      Particularly telling in the case was the fact that many      German brewers use additives in their export beer.    </p>  <h3> Michigan Goes Wild</h3>        <p>      The Michigan Marketing Association is looking for resident      growers and foragers who can supply such wildlings as      burdock root, cattail shoots, nettle greens, fiddle-heads,      nasturtium flowers, papaws and per-simmons. "Specialty      produce is the hottest thing in the grocery business      today," says Christopher Steele, president of the      organization. "People are looking for the exotic in their      fruit and vegetable shopping." The organization will      publish a catalog this fall and plans to start marketing      wild produce next spring. Michiganders interested in      participating can contact Christopher Steele, Michigan      Marketing Association, 1118 N. Walnut St., Lansing, MI      48906.    </p>   <h3>Fast Food Guide</h3>    <p>      If you're curious about what you and your children are      <em>really</em> biting into when you eat at McDonald's,      Burger King or any of 13 other major chains, check out      <em>The Fast Food Guide.</em> The up-to-date paperback,      published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest,      lists the calorie, fat and sodium content of all major menu      offerings, and includes charts and lists of ingredients to      help you compare items. It's available for $4.95 plus 30e      handling from CSPI, 1501 16th St. N.W., Washington, DC      20036.    </p>  <h3> Cash for Trash</h3>    <p>      Dozens of communities are expected to follow in the      enterprising footsteps of Rockford, Illinois, which has      gained renown for its effective "Cash for Trash" promotion.      Each week a trash bag is chosen at random from the city's      residential garbage collection. If the bag contains only      "real" trash and not recyclable newspapers or aluminum, the      owner receives $1,000 (the funds are paid from city      contracts with trash-collection companies). If there's no      winner, $1,000 is added to the next week's pot. Collections      at recycling centers tripled in the first 10 weeks of the      program.    </p>   <h3>Seminars and Workshops</h3>    <p>      Eleventh Annual Cosby Dulcimer & Harp Convention (June      12-14); $4 evening only, $9 one day, $17 weekend.
