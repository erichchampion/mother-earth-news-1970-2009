                		<p>Hand-split "shakes" are unmatched for beauty.</p> <h5 id="byline">By David Petersen </h5>        <p>      Near as Peter Gott can recollect, he's split some 15,000      shingles over the past quarter of a century. Appalachia's      master hewn-log craftsman used the most recent batch of      4,300 in the fall of '85 to replace the original      23-year-old cedar shingle roofs on the Gott family cabin      and outbuildings in Cowbell Holler, which is just a piece      off Tater Gap Road in the Smoky Mountain foothills of      western North Carolina.    </p>    <p>      And as Peter proved to me-among the least crafty of      wood craftsmen-anyone who owns a few inexpensive hand      tools and a good measure of patience can learn to split (or      <em>rive,</em> to use the appropriate lingo) beautiful wood      shingles.    </p>    <p>      When calculating the number of shingles required for a      roofing job, Gott figures 400 standard-sized shingles (3      1/2" to 9" wide by 19" long) per square (100 square feet)      of roof to be covered. While a novice would have to hustle      to rive even a few dozen usable shingles in a day, Peter      can turn out several hundred in the same period of time.    </p>    <p>      Here's how it's done:    </p>    <p>      First you need a tree-or maybe <em>several</em>      trees, depending on the number of shingles required and the      diameter of the tree. If you live in or near the eastern      hardwood forests, just about any variety of oak will      suffice-, Peter uses red oak because it's both plentiful      and easy to split (though less durable than white oak). Out      west, most varieties of pine and some firs are suitable for      shingles, but these softwoods should be treated with a      low-toxicity, nonflammable wood preservative to forestall      rotting.    </p>    <p>      Whatever variety you decide to use, the tree should be      free-of knots, true of trunk, straight-grained (as opposed      to twisted) and at least 24" in diameter. After felling the      tree, saw the trunk into round sections (shingle blocks)      19" long, being careful to cut straight across rather than      at angles. Roll or haul the blocks to the work area and      stand them on end for splitting. (Yes, you rive shingles      from <em>green</em> wood.)    </p>    <h3>SHINGLE SPLITTING STEP BY STEP</h3>    <p>      Splitting, or "riving," shingles isn't as difficult as you      might imagine. Master craftsman Peter Gott can hand-split      them from red oak as fast as his wife, Polly, can nail them      in place. Of course, you won't pick up that kind of speed      without a good bit of practice. The instructions provided      here should get you started.    </p>					 <h3> Tools of the Shingle Maker's Trade</h3>    <p>      You'll need only a few inexpensive hand tools to get      splitting: a froe (a short-handled cleaving tool), a      hardwood mallet or club (for driving the froe), a metal      splitting wedge (or two), a sledgehammer (for driving the      wedge) and a rule. Dividers are handy but not essential.    </p>    <p>      You'll also need a <em>shingle break,</em> which is a jig      used to hold shakes during the final few splits. A      traditional shingle break can be made from a 6' to 7'      section of 4"- to 5"-diameter forked tree, with the forks      accounting for about 3/4 of the overall length. (Peter says      red maple and dogwood often have perfect forks for this      purpose.) Use two poles 5' to 6' long to support the split      end of the fork, and rest the butt on a block of wood about      19" high. On the ground directly beneath the V of the fork,      place a 12"-square wood block to support the bottoms of the      shingle bolts. (If you have trouble with the fork spreading      during splits, Peter recommends binding the forked ends      together with light chain.)    </p>    <p>      Peter prefers this traditional-type break for making the      intermediate splits, and uses a lumber-scrap break for the      final, precise split. This second break is nothing more      than a short length of large-diameter log that sup ports a      frame of scrap lumber (an extra 19"-long shingle block is      ideal). You can make it in just a few minutes, and here's      how:    </p>    <p>      Stand a hardwood shingle block upright, and nail a couple      of 2 X 6s (or 2 X 4s, 2 X 8s, etc.)-cut long enough      to reach from the ground to about 16" above the top of the      log-upright and parallel on either side of the block      so that they stick up like horns. Now nail a length of 1 X      6 (or 1 X 4, 1 X 8, etc.) from the front edge of one of the      uprights to the <em>rear</em> of the other, with the bottom      edge of the 1 X 6 positioned parallel to and about 3" above      the top of the support log. Finally, nail a second 1 X 6      horizontally to the front edges of the two uprights so that      its bottom is 3/4" above the top edge of the lower 1 X 6.    </p>    <p>      With the shingle break constructed and your tools and      materials assembled (see the accompanying sidebar for      details), examine the end grain of the first shingle block      to be split. That large dark area at the center is the      heartwood, and the lighter layer just under the bark is the      sapwood. Everything in between is shingle meat.    </p>    <p>      Before splitting, mark each shingle block into      pie-slice-shaped segments measuring 3 1/2" wide at the      outside edge, taking the measurements just inside the inner      ring of sapwood. Most of your blocks will already have a      small split in the center; trace it out to the edge (along      the radial lines), and make your first mark here. Next,      step off with 3 1/2" marks in both directions until the      marks meet (more or less) on the opposite side of the      block. Finally, go back and darken every fourth mark.    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to split, halving the block along the      marks you've just made, beginning with the darker lines.      The overall idea here is that each split will divide the      wood in half equally, helping assure that the splits will      run true.    </p>    <p>      To make the initial split, start the blade of the froe into      the wood with a few solid blows from your mallet, then      apply lateral pressure on the handle to widen the split.      (If necessary, remove the froe and use a sledge and wedges      to finish the split.) Next-again following the      guidelines nearest to the center of each      section-split the halves equally so that you have 4      more or less equal pie-shaped wedges.    </p>    <p>      Still following your marks, go on to split each      quarter-round block in half so that you have 8 sections.      Now, following the curvature of the wood's annual growth      rings, use wedge and sledge to split a few inches of      heartwood (which is often twisted or knotty) from the point      of each triangular section- then use froe and mallet      to split the blunted wedges in half again.    </p>		    <p>      After splitting off as many 3 1/2"-wide wedges as each      section of log will provide, carefully split each wedge      into two 1 3/4" slices. Now get rid of the bark and      rot-prone sapwood by splitting it off with the same tools      you employed for removing the heartwood tips; split in from      both ends and then chop off what's left in the middle.    </p>    <p>      Here's where the going calls for precision. Move over to      the shingle break, stand a 1 3/4"-wide shake on end and      wedge it into the apex of the reclining V formed by the two      1 X 6s. Now <em>carefully</em> center the froe and begin      the split with a gentle tap from your mallet. With the froe      embedded blade-deep in the wood, pull the shake out of the      V, wedge it flat between the upper and lower horizontal 1 X      6s and apply downward pressure on the handle to finish the      split.    </p>    <p>      If one of these final splits tries to "run out" to one side      or the other rather than going straight down the center,      turn the shake so that its thickest side is to the bottom,      apply downward pressure on the handle of the froe (and thus      on the shake) and the split should turn back toward center.      (You may have to rotate a problem shake several times to      keep the split running straight.)    </p>    <p>      Repeat this procedure until you have a pile of shingles      each measuring approximately <em>7/16"</em> on the thick      edge and tapering evenly to about 3/16" on the thin edge.      If some of your shingles have irregularities, such as high      spots on one face or the other, they can be dressed up a      bit with a draw knife or a hewing hatchet (which, like a      broadax, is beveled only on one side). Ragged edges can be      smoothed with a hewing hatchet or a slick (a very large      chisel-3' or so overall-designed for working logs).    </p>    <p>      Tie the finished shingles in neat, tight bundles of 20,      stacked with thin and thick edges alternating to prevent      warping. (These bundles of 20 make for quick counting and      are light enough to tote up a ladder to the roof.) It's      best to install fresh shingles soon after riving them,      while they're still green and pliable. But if you must      store yours for some time, tie the bundles tightly to      prevent warping.    </p>   <h3>Between Rafters and Shingles</h3>    <p>      Many frontier-America log cabins were roofed with very      large hand-split shingles attached to purlins or lath, in      many cases simply weighted down rather than nailed. Since      the lath strips were spaced several inches (and purlins up      to 3') apart, a couple of overlapping layers of wood      shingles provided the only covering for most of the roof      -no solid wood decking, no vapor barrier and no insulation.    </p>    <p>      While some larger early American log homes had crawlspace      attics, most frontier cabins depended on sleeping lofts to      provide a thermal buffer against both the sun's heat in      summer and the cold of winter. This arrangement provided a      fairly comfortable interior temperature on the ground      floor, but turned the loft into an ice chest in winter and      a sauna in summer.    </p>    <p>      While strongly tradition-oriented, Peter Gott doesn't      recommend being <em>that</em> traditional (except, perhaps,      for outbuildings). Rather, he suggests the following      roofing arrangement:    </p>    <p>      No matter what type of outer roofing material you plan to      use (wood, asphalt, fiberglass, metal, etc.), start by      nailing a strong decking-such as kiln-dried, V-joint,      tongue-and-groove pine boards or exteriorgrade      plywood-over the rafters. (Note: Traditional rafters      are straight, peeled poles, at least 4" to 6" in diameter,      with their top sides flattened so that dimension lumber can      be nailed to them. When such poles aren't available, Peter      uses 4" X 6" or larger sawn timbers.)    </p>    <p>      Over the decking, tack down a layer of 30" pound roofing      felt. Next, stand a row of vertical 2 X 6s-one positioned      directly above each rafter-on edge and toenail them through      the decking and into the rafters, filling the spaces      between the 2 X 6s to within an inch of the top with      fiberglass batting or urethane foam insulation. (That inch      of space above the insulation-in combination with      screen vents at the bottom of the roof and, if possible, at      the ridge-will allow for air circulation and prevent      condensation.) The top layer can be either plywood      sheathing (best under asphalt shingles), 1 X 6 boards (best      under metal roofing) or 1 X 3 lath strips (for wood      shingles).    </p>   <h3>Up on the Roof, Down on Your Knees</h3>	     <p>      Peter begins each shingling job by nailing a 1 X 6 strip of      bevel siding (thick edge down) along the eave (bottom edge      of the roof to set the proper angle for the first row of      shingles. He then nails a 1 ' -wide strip of aluminum      flashing atop the bevel siding so that it overhangs the      eave by 3/4", bending the resulting 3/4" metal lip down to      form a "drip edge" that prevents water from being sucked up      under the sheathing through the wicking action of the wood.    </p>    <p>      The first row (along the eave) gets 2 thicknesses of      shingles. The bottom layer is cut down to 2/3 length, with      a layer of fulllength shingles nailed directly on top-with      the joints in the 2 layers staggered to prevent leaks-to      provide a full overlap that extends 1 1/2" to 2" below the      aluminum drip edge. Using a chalk line to keep the rows      straight, Peter begins a new row of shingles every 6" up      the roof. Given the 19" average length of the shakes, this      provides a triple overlap for maximum protection against      leaks, should a shingle split.    </p>    <p>      Working from either gable end of the roof, Peter lays the      first shingle in each row with its thick edge facing out.      The remaining shakes in the row are usually alternatedthick      edges together, then thin edges together-leaving a      gap of 1/8" to 1/4" between shingles. Each shingle overlaps      the row below by about 1/3, so that no 2 joints line up in      3 successive layers. Rule: Each new shingle should cover      the shingle below by at least 1 1/2", and the one below      that by at least 1/2".    </p>    <p>      To secure the roof, Peter uses two 6penny galvanized nails      in each shingle, placing the nails about 3/4" in from each      edge and 7 1/2" or so up from the butt (aligned to      penetrate the underlying lath strips); this way, the      nailheads will be covered by the next row of shingles.    </p>    <p>      Peter weatherproofs the ridge with an underlying strip of      20"-wide aluminum flashing, folding the flashing over the      ridge and securing it under the final couple of rows of      shingles on each side of the ridge. And while many builders      trim the top row of shingles level with the ridge and then      cap the roof with a decorative row of horizontal shingles,      Peter prefers the traditional Appalachian "feathered      ridge," wherein the top 2 rows of shingles on the windward      side of the roof jut up several inches above the ridge to      act as a crude but effective flashing.    </p>    <h3>Does the End justify the Effort?</h3>    <p>      Hand-splitting wood shingles is quite the rustic and      romantic project, and when a master craftsman such as Peter      Gott does it, riving looks like child's play. But let's be      reasonable. By the time a novice cuts, limbs, sections and      hauls in a large tree for shingle stock, cobbles together a      shake break, then splits a few thousand shingles . . . is      it really worth all the sweat and smashed fingernails just      to save a few bucks?    </p>    <p>      From a purely economic viewpoint-unless you're up      against a financial wall and have rain pouring in through      holes in your roof-the answer is probably no. But      there's more to doing for yourself than simple economics.      What <em>does</em> make riving your own shingles worth the      effort is the rush of pride you'll get-for years to      come-every time you lift your gaze to your rooftop      handiwork.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: We've prepared a 60-plus construction      manual detailing Peter Gott's Appalachian log-building      methods.
