    <p>
                   <p>      Can market gardening pay in this farm-killing economy?      Judging by the three people we visited, the answer is yes,      yes and no.    </p>        <p>      Many a back yard gardener, happily tending vegetables or      flowers, has stopped to ponder: <em>Wouldn't it be fun to      do this all the time?</em> To garden during the workweek      instead of squeezing it in during spare hours?    </p>    <p>      Most of us dwell only a moment on that fantasy before going      back to weeding the carrots-because behind that first,      appealing query lies a more basic and difficult one:      <em>Would it be possible?</em> Can a person expand a      garden, find buyers for fresh, homegrown crops and actually      earn a living?    </p>    <p>      To find out, let's visit three people who, collectively,      have spent 20 years trying to fulfill this dream: Sam      Smith, with his six-acre Caretaker Farm in Williamstown,      Massachusetts; David Miskell, on three acres outside      Burlington, Vermont; and Bob Gow, with three acres of      produce and flowers in rural Zionville, North Carolina.      Their stories will reveal many of the ingredients that can      make market gardening a success-or a failure.    </p>    <p>      Williamstown, a small college town, lies in a beautiful New      England setting that beckons to summer tourists. Many fine      restaurants cater to those visitors. And Sam Smith caters      to those restaurants, selling lettuce and other vegetables      to a dozen eateries from May through September.    </p>    <p>      Smith-wiry, friendly and 51 years old-has run      his large garden/small farm for 12 years. His 10-acre      holding consists of good land in a flat, fertile valley,      and his home is comfortable and attractive. He speaks      quietly, a dedicated, self-assured but not boastful man.    </p>		     <p>      Lettuce is Smith's mainstay. By early June, he's starting a      whopping 3,200 plants a week. He also ships potatoes and      onions (two crops that store well) each fall to Bread &      Circus, an organic food co-op in Boston. And he grows sweet      corn, which, along with other vegetables, cut flowers,      seedlings and the bread his wife, Elizabeth, bakes, moves      quickly at their roadside produce stand. But the bulk of      Smith's income-and indeed, of Miskell's and Gow's, as      well-comes from restaurants: places that truly      appreciate fresh, high-quality lettuce, summer squash,      parsley, basil and carrots, and are willing to pay for      them.    </p>    <p>      When Sam started market gardening seriously back in 1975,      he found these customers by paying daytime visits to area      chefs and showing them his goods, produce that in many      cases was the best the cooks had ever seen. And today he      spends about a third of his workday filling and delivering      orders.    </p>    <p>      But how does he manage to keep a 6 1/2-acre garden      producing? Smith says simply, "There's no sexy secret to      it. Success comes from hard work and persistence." He's not      kidding: From April 1 to mid-October, he puts in continuous      80-hour workweeks, with no days off.    </p>    <p>      In addition, three or four apprentices work on the farm      each summer, putting in six-day workweeks and receiving in      return room, board, $60 a week (starting pay) and valuable      hands-on experience. "I've had very good apprentices,"      Smith readily admits. "They've made a big difference."    </p>    <p>      But there's more to success than labor. Sam has refined a      very efficient set of growing systems. To begin with, all      his crops are grown in space-saving raised beds. He doesn't      hand-dig those four-foot-wide beds (some of which are over      100 yards long), but uses a wide-wheeled, 50-horsepower      Massey-Ferguson tractor to first chisel plow the soil, then      construct the beds with a mechanical bed former. (Disks on      the former's sides push pathway dirt up under the tractor,      then a set of flat boards smooths the raised soil.)    </p>		     <p>      He starts his seedlings in polystyrene Speedling trays that      each contain enough individual plugs for 200 plants. Once      the seedlings are ready to leave his gas-heated greenhouse,      Smith and his helpers set them out, four rows to a bed.      They lay down two 16-foot 1 X 8 boards with marked notches      to show just where to set each seedling. One person makes      each transplant hole with a dibble stick; another follows      and inserts the plants.    </p>    <p>      To weed the beds, he pulls a scuffle (or stir-rup) hoe all      the way down the gaps between plant rows. The open design      of the hoe's triangular cutting face makes it easy to pull      the tool behind him as he walks down the pathway. If done      early, this takes care of most invasive plants. Others are      pulled by hand.    </p>    <p>      Smith spends no energy or money on pest control-not      even a few dollars a year on <em>Bacillus      thuringiensis</em> or some other organic spray. Indeed, the      University of Massachusetts sends agricultural students out      every week in the summer to monitor the Colorado potato      beetle population in his one-acre potato field. They use      his unsprayed-and undamaged-potatoes as a      benchmark for comparison to pest-ridden conventional      plantings. (When Smith started potato growing, he lost half      his crop to beetle damage, but the pests' numbers have      dropped every year, and the population of predatory insects      has risen: "Our plot now has Heinz's 57 varieties of      ladybug beetles.")    </p>    <p>      Smith's crops are also so healthy they resist pests. He      puts great emphasis on soil fertility. With the help of his      tractor, he spreads 25 tons of imported and composted      chicken manure and wood shavings on each acre every year.      He also rotates growing and fallow areas and sows cover      crops of winter rye and hairy vetch or oats whenever      possible. Smith even plants red clover in among his growing      corn with a seeder-cultipacker that <em>runs over</em> his      two- to three-inch seedlings: "It looks like it crushes the      corn plants, but they recover and have the head start they      need on the clovers."    </p>    <p>      Sam Smith grosses an impressive $34,000 per year (and all      the vegetables his family and apprentices can eat) from      Caretaker Farm but says his success didn't come overnight.      "It took years for me to get an understanding of my plot      and for the soil to get balanced and fertile. One of the      key skills I've developed is a sense of timing. When 20      things need to be done at once, I now know which one really      <em>has</em> to be done just then. You can't learn that      skill from any source but experience."    </p>		 	    <p>      Where Sam Smith is wiry and composed, 37-year-old David      Miskell is stocky and intensely serious-a man with a      lot on his mind and hands. Miskell's northern Vermont land      is different, as well. His arable site contains only three      acres instead of 10 and is bordered closely by woodland. It      looks more like a spaceefficient and well-managed garden      than a miniature farm.    </p>    <p>      The most striking aspect of David's garden is that a large      percentage of it is covered by plastic. Many of the beds      are covered with hoop-supported, partially slitted      polyethylene. Others are topped with white floating row      covers (spunbonded polyester or polypropylene sheets so      light they can be laid right on top of the frailest garden      crops, and so permeable that rain and most of the sunlight      pass right through). There are also two large poly-covered,      Quonset-shaped greenhouses.    </p>    <p>      Why the big cover-up? Miskell focuses on beating the timing      of other growers, and those plastic shelters enable him to      have fresh produce long before <em>and</em> after competing      gardeners do: "My crops always have to be earlier than      everybody else's and have the highest quality. The only way      for me to survive is to keep innovating, to keep coming up      with new crops and ways to grow them."    </p>    <p>      It works. While Miskell also sells lettuce and other      vegetables to local restaurants, he grosses $26,000 from      his three acres, 50% more per acre than Sam Smith. Since      some of David's success comes from having crops      earlier-and later-than local competitors, his      nonstop work year is also longer than Smith's.    </p>    <p>      Miskell learned his skills by apprenticing at Elliot      Coleman's biodynamic herb farm in Rhode Island and then by      working for market gardeners in France. (His wife, Susan,      was the head gardener for famous home steading advocates      Helen and Scott Nearing.) Five years ago, he set out to      establish his own commercial garden on the three acres he      leases from the Shelburne Farms estate. The location, only      a few miles from Burlington, Vermont's largest city,      provides a ready market for his produce.    </p>    <p>      While Miskell uses plastics to extend his growing season      much more intensively than Smith, many of the other      technical differences are less significant. David uses a      Ladbrooke soil-block maker to make the soil cubes for his      seedlings instead of growing starts in trays. ("My lettuce      seedlings germinate in two days," he boasts.) He works his      land with a 16-hp BCS tiller instead of a tractor and makes      flat, not raised, beds. He marks and makes his transplant      holes by pulling a lawn roller studded with soil-cubesized      blocks over the prepared beds. And while, like Smith, he      uses a stirrup hoe for weeding, Miskell's has a wheel and      handle so he can stand fully erect while he scoots it back      and forth among his crops. "Most market gardeners I know      have bad backs," David explains. "Two years ago, by the end      of the season I was harvesting lying down. So any tool that      reduces bending over is good by me."    </p>		     <p>      Miskell also employs three to four apprentices, for $125 a      week and a share of the profits at the end of the season.      "They really shouldn't be called apprentices, but workers,"      he says. "I lecture to them only one evening a week."    </p>    <p>      His plot is close to pest-free: "Occasionally I use      Triple-Plus, a mixture of rotenone, pyrethrum and ryania,      for an insect problem or put copper sulfate on the tomatoes      to reduce blight. On the whole, though, I try to follow the      agricultural approach of biodynamics"-the organic      method invented by Rudolph Steiner-"and learn how to      treat the cause of a problem instead of its symptoms." Deer      are a little harder to deal with. More than once they've      caused significant damage to his crops.    </p>    <p>      David has often experimented with growing and marketing      gourmet vegetables better known in Europe than America.      He's succeeded with mâche, radicchio (a red-leaf      chicory), finocchio (a succulent, faintly licorice-flavored      Italian vegetable) and other exotic crops, but admits that      now he's focusing more on such restaurant mainstays as      lettuce, herbs, tomatoes, spinach, peppers, scallions and      leeks: "I decided at the start I'd figure out what it cost      me to produce something, add on a fair markup and then set      my selling price. If no one will buy it at that price, I      change crops."    </p>    <p>      That practical marketing approach is essential if one is to      avoid the no-profit quagmire many conventional farmers are      stuck in today, but it demands sharp marketing and crop      selection skills. Miskell is only too aware of how tenuous      the niche he fills is. "The state of Maine has organized a      broccoli project for troubled potato farmers. I can't      compete with subsidized growers, so I don't grow much      broccoli.    </p>    <p>      "And the pressure's going to get worse. Tobacco farmers in      North Carolina are switching to vegetables. I'm starting to      get competition from farmers in Virginia, Maryland and      Georgia. The Dutch, Japanese and Israelis are investing in      Caribbean farms-they figure those islands will be the      next California.    </p>    <p>      "To survive, the small grower has to be really good with      direct marketing and management. Being organic helps      because it lowers your management costs and gives you      better produce. But it doesn't, in itself, sell crops. I      don't market my produce as organic, but as high-quality,      good-tasting and chemical-free."    </p>		     <p>      Miskell is also quite conscious of how valuable his      hard-earned gardening skills are. "I don't give my      knowledge away to anyone who just drops in. Information is      real valuable-I've spent 14 years gathering mine. So      I sell my knowledge by consulting for Progressive      Agrisystems. We work a lot with helping farmers convert      from chemical-based to organic agriculture, helping them      with their specific soil fertility, etc."    </p>    <p>      When Miskell talks about how hard he works to maintain a      competitive marketing edge, his whole enterprise sounds      risky and insecure. But so far he's done better and better      every year. Indeed, he's got plans to eventually move to a      larger piece of land near a main highway, where he can grow      10 acres of produce and sell it direct at a roadside stand.      The vision expands from there to include permanent      employees, a training institute and contracting for fruits,      sweet corn and other vegetables from other growers.    </p>    <p>      For now, though, the man running the smallest commercial      farm in Vermont is focused on proving that you can make a      good living from just three acres.    </p>  <p><strong> "The only way for me to survive is to keep      innovating."</strong></p>    <p>      Work your way from North Carolina into Tennessee on      mountain road No. 421, turn right at Trade's post office,      cross back into North Carolina, wind around a few miles,      head up a dirt road that's tightly hemmed in by hillsides      and you'll finally reach Bob and Sandy Gow's 107-year-old      house and five-year-old market garden. Bob himself combines      the lean body and callused hands of a true dirt farmer with      the long hair and beard of the '60s. The house itself is,      well, funky: no indoor plumbing, walls adorned with batts      of fiberglass insulation and an overhead view of rafters      instead of a finished ceiling.    </p>		     <p>      But after just a few minutes' conversation with this      resigned-yet still powerfully dedicated-man and      his warm, hardworking wife, Sandy, the surroundings fade      from view and the passion of their story takes over.    </p>    <p>      "We started here about six years ago," Bob says, "when I      left my job as the gardening instructor in the earth      studies program at Appalachian State University. As a      former pupil of Alan Chadwick"-a one-time      Shakespearean actor who founded the biodynamic/ French      intensive, raised-bed method of gardening-"I was      attracted to the healing aspects of gardening. So we      cleared an acre of poison oak, started a terraced garden on      these steep hills and sold $6,000 worth of produce.    </p>    <p>      "The second year, I expanded to 1 1/2 acres, paid one      person to help and made $14,000. Mostly we sold vegetables      such as spinach, lettuce and broccoli, taking advan tage of      our 3,200-foot elevation to raise those heat-sensitive      crops all summer long. As much as possible, I tried to      follow Chadwick's methods and aesthetics. I `cheated' some:      I used a rotary tiller and large-bladed Guatemalan hoe to      form our raised beds instead of digging them by hand, and I      fertilized with truckloads of hauled-in manure instead of      aged compost. But I planted in the hexagonal patterns      Chadwick followed and, like him, closely interplanted      flowers and vegetables.    </p>    <p>      "My real passion is growing flowers, not vegetables, so      that year we tried to sell some cut flowers in the nearby      city of Boone. We made bouquets using 12 varieties of      fresh-cut flowers and 15 varieties of dried ones, and sold      them all in just <em>three hours.</em>    </p>    <p>      "The next year, 1984, we grossed $35,000 from a 2 1/2-acre      garden. We had five apprentices-almost a little      gardening school.    </p>    <p>      "I was selling my vegetables to restaurants in Charlotte, a      two-hour drive away. The big seller was spinach. Spinach      was dollars-I got $25 a bushel for it and was selling      25 bushels a week. Parsley was another good one. Just weed      it once or twice a season, and it would keep on producing.      Almost every plate in a restaurant has to have parsley on      it, so I could sell 30 pounds a week at $5 a pound. I also      got $6 a pound for baby squash with the flowers on and an      incredible $20 for 12 heads of radicchio.    </p>    <p>      "Then in the winter Sandy and I made wreaths, bouquets and      hat decorations from our dried flowers. We traveled to      winter craft shows in Carolina and Florida, selling $700      worth of flowers a day at the shows. It was like a month of      paid vacation.    </p>    <p>      "So now we had garden money coming in year-round.      Everything was falling in place. We were high, hot to trot,      jacked.    </p>    <p>      "Then came '85 with a hot, dry spring, an incredibly wet      midsummer and a hot, dry fall. It was like the weather      pulled apart in the center and caved in. Everything      rotted-our flowers, our spinach, our lettuce. Along      with that, the spinach leafminer moved into our county. It      wiped me out-I couldn't sell those miner-blotched      leaves. I harvested the equivalent of two beds' worth of      spinach from every 10 I planted.    </p>    <p>      "I probably got the leafminer problem from growing so much      spinach. I'd have 20 beds going at once, staggering my      harvest, and that provided an ongoing supply for the pests.      I got kinda metaphysical about the loss. I'd been real      unhappy growing that much spinach-Chadwick followers      don't like to grow so much of one thing.    </p>    <p>      "We grossed only $17,000 in '85. This spring, though, we      were ready to recover and do better than ever. We had our      flowers all ready to transplant early in May. But then came      three straight weeks of rain. The flowers sat too long in      the cold frames and got ruined. After that came the drought      and the heat-summer weather that was normally      80°F was 100°. That burned up my tender vegetable      crops.    </p>    <p>      "In July, I gave up. We decided to forget market gardening.      Instead we focused on putting in a fantastic home garden      and selling the surplus. Next spring, I'll be working an      outside job landscaping an estate.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>"We've been very successful at everything except making      money."</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      "Weather and insects put me under. But that's not the only      reason I'm quitting. I'm so tired of doing it by myself, of      me being the boss and my wife the employee.    </p>    <p>      "I burned out so many apprentices that they don't come here      anymore. One good friend of mine called me `You Gotta' Gow      because I was always saying things like, `We gotta sow that      seed <em>now</em> or it'll rain and we'll lose the crop      rotation.'    </p>    <p>      "My family's had incredible patience. But I want to stop      telling them everything's just got to wait. The other day      my little boy came up to me and said, `Daddy, I wish we had      a bathtub.' My own son was asking me for a bathtub!    </p>    <p>      "It's not the work. I love gardening. It's as good a work      as anyone will ever find-very creative and      heart-expanding. I'm just tired of trying to translate      gardening into dollars. For me, it doesn't work for a      full-time income.    </p>    <p>      "When I look back, I can see some things I did wrong. I      made things hard for myself by living so far away from my      market. It would have been better if I had spent more time      as an apprentice myself, instead of plunging ahead and      being forged on my mistakes. And I worked too hard to      satisfy my Chadwick-inspired artistic self. I should have      planted blocks of crops instead of mixtures so I could      water them all the same. I should have planted more in      rows. Planting in hexagons gives incredible yields from      small spaces-but it takes too much work.    </p>    <p>      At this point, Sandy lifts her head from her food-canning      labors and speaks up. "I wouldn't discourage people from      market gardening, but they'll need to be better prepared      than we were . . . to have some money behind them when they      start-or one of them needs an outside job-so      they can get their living space comfortable and not be      dependent on that first year's income. We never caught up      with our basic needs. And no mar ket gardeners should have      small children while starting out, so the husband and wife      can both do more work. I feel like I've been pregnant all      five years Bob and I have been together. And having another      family to share the work with would be wonderful and make      everything go much, much easier."    </p>    <p>      Bob agrees and sums up his experiences: "We've been very      successful at everything except making money. That's the      truth. It's not a negative statement. It just is."    </p>    <p>      From the experiences of Sam Smith, David Miskell and Bob      Gow, a few lessons are clear. Market gardening is a      well-named profession, for it clearly demands a great deal      of practical skill at both gardening and marketing. It also      demands a good location with fertile soil and ready access      to markets.    </p>    <p>      Given such conditions, a market garden <em>can</em> be      successful. And, like any other business enterprise, it can      also fail.    </p>
