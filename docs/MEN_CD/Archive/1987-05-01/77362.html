                 		<h5 id="byline">By Tom Turner</h5>   <h3> Ecotimidity</h3>    <p>      Is the environmental movement getting too cautious?      Consider the following:    </p>    <p>      In west-central Texas, as I mentioned in issue 103, plans      are afoot to build the Stacey Dam just below the confluence      of the Colorado and Concho rivers. There are many things      wrong with the proposal, not the least of which is the fact      that, if implemented, it would wreck most of the remaining      habitat for the endangered Concho water snake and probably      kill most of the snakes outright. In Sacramento,      California, the city fathers have given their blessing to a      big real estate development on the outskirts of town. The      development is in flagrant violation of the city's own      master plan, which calls for building in vacant parts of      town before reaching out to the fringes. The policy was      intended to minimize commuting, cut down on air pollution      and preserve agricultural lands. In the northern Rockies      surrounding Yellowstone National Park are the last remnants      of the noble grizzly bear population in the lower 48.      Habitat for some bears is shrinking as people usurp the      land for roads, gas wells, ski resorts and logging      operations. Yet Montana directly threatens the      grizzly-an endangered species-with a hunting      season.    </p>        <p>      Classic environmental problems all, but they have something      unexpected in common: The environmental community is      ambivalent about what to do.    </p>    <p>      In Texas, they remember the snail darter. In the mid-'70s,      the Tennessee Valley Authority commenced construction of      the Tellico Dam on the New River in Tennessee. The dam was      a real stinkeroo: It cost more than it could ever hope to      return, it destroyed valuable farmland and a lovely stretch      of river, and it drove people from land their forebears had      lived on for two centuries.    </p>    <p>      None of the economic or aesthetic arguments against the dam      had slowed it down one iota. But then a biologist in waders      netted a small fish he later identified as a snail darter.      It was, almost by definition, an endangered species, since      it was so little known in the area. The researcher then      went fishing for a lawyer, the lawyer sued to stop      construction of the dam and the court ordered work      suspended.    </p>    <p>      The half-built dam stayed that way for many months as the      legal battle raged. Editorial cartoonists took great      delight in this David vs. Goliath contest. For the most      part, the press heaped ridicule on those who would use a      tiny fish to stop something so nearly sacred as a dam. In      the end, Congress ordered that the dam be finished.    </p>    <p>      Opponents of the Stacey Dam don't want the same thing to      happen to them, so they're loath to ride the Concho water      snake to the courthouse.    </p>    <p>      Much the same holds true up in grizzly country. In Montana,      some environmentalists are nervous about coming out      foursquare against the state-sanctioned <em>hunt,</em> for      goodness' sake. It's not a big item, to be sure (the      maximum number of grizzlies allowed to die in      Montana-from natural causes or bullets-would      not exceed 14 for the year), but it's shocking to many      people that a rare creature like the griz can be hunted for      sport. Again, a lawsuit might well stop the hunt, but the      political heat would be fierce, and hunters (who are      potential allies in the fight against habitat destruction)      would be alienated.    </p>    <p>      In Sacramento, the subject is different but the      faint-heartedness is familiar. There, some environmental      types are leery of suing the EPA to enforce the Clean Air      Act for fear that Congress might turn around and amend the      act out from under them.    </p>    <p>      Indeed it might. Congress could toss the Clean Air Act      clean out the window and substitute a bill that puts a      bounty on anyone who wears hiking boots or knows the words      to "Val-de Ri, Val-de Ra."    </p>    <p>      But Congress could do that anyway. The real question is,      What's the use of having a Clean Air Act and an Endangered      Species Act if they aren't enforced-and enforced      vigorously?    </p>    <p>      One of the principal duties of the environmental movement      is to ride herd on government to see that the laws that      were won with such sophisticated lobbying are put to their      intended purposes. If environmentalists won't insist on      strict adherence to the laws of the land, who will?    </p>    <h3>Washington Watch</h3>    <p>      As I intimated in this space last issue, Congress quickly      enacted the Clean Water Act following President Reagan's      veto last November. Branded a "budget buster" by Mr.      Reagan, the bill provides some $20 billion in grants to      states for sewage treatment plants over the next 10 years.    </p>    <p>      The president vetoed the bill again, but this time Congress      hadn't left Washington, and the veto was thunderously      overridden. With Democrats back in the Senate saddle, this      may not be the last time Congress butts heads with the      White House on environmental matters.    </p>    <p>      Another controversial issue that could easily lead to      confrontation is acid rain. Despite escalating complaints      from the Canadian government and accelerating warnings from      doctors and scientists about the disastrous impact of      acid-laden rain, snow and fog, the administration continues      to argue that more research is necessary before decisive      action is taken. Congress came close to passing an acid      rain bill last session, despite the administration's      opposition; it's likely to pass this time.    </p>   <h3>Nature Library</h3>    <p>      Paul Ehrlich, certainly no stranger to MOTHER'S readers,      has just published a new book: <em>The Machinery of      Nature</em> (Simon and Schuster, $18.95), an      up-to-the-minute layman's guide to exactly what the title      suggests. Like other Ehrlich books, it's sprightly,      comprehensive and pulls no punches. It does raise one      imponderable question, though: When in the dickens does      Professor Ehrlich find time to teach? (He's got another      book, <em>Earth,</em> coming out soon.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Tom Turner, a writer and editor who's      worked in the environmental field for 17 years, is with the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, an independent en</em>      <em>vironmental law firm that represents many organizations      across the country.
