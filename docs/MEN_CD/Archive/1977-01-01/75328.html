                      <p>      This page contains excerpts from issues of <em>Succesful      Farming</em> dated 1907.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>HANDY DEVICES</h3>    <div class="image">    <p class="caption"><strong>SAW BUCK.</strong></p>      <img src="../images/043-126-01-saw-buck.jpg" alt="043-126-01-saw-buck.jpg" width="100" height="82" />		</div>      <p>      Take two good sized forked sticks and bore holes through      above the forks and insert strong sticks. This makes each      part a tripod that will stand up alone. They are convenient      in sawing long or heavy pieces and are easy to fit any      length of stick. <em>-</em> <em>E. F., Iowa.</em>    </p>    <div class="image">    <p class="caption"><strong>POULTRY WATERER.</strong></p>      <img src="../images/043-126-01-poultry-waterer.jpg" alt="043-126-01-poultry-waterer.jpg" width="80" height="74" />		</div>      <p>      Take a jug and drill a quarter inch hole in one side near      the bottom and set the jug in a shallow pan. Fill with      water and cork up tight. Air will prevent pan from flowing      over, and will regulate the supply of water. It is      automatic when jug contains water. <em>Roy</em>      <em>McDonald, Tex.</em>    </p>    <div class="image">    <p class="caption"><strong>HOG SCRAPER.</strong></p>      <img src="../images/043-126-01-hog-scraper.jpg" alt="043-126-01-hog-scraper.jpg" width="80" height="81" />		</div>     <p>      To scrape the bristles off a hog after scalding take a      small iron hoop and fit a block half way so as to leave a      flange. Insert a handle and you have a convenient scraper      similar to those the packers use.- <em>Robert      Johnson, Conn.</em>    </p>    <div class="image">    <p class="caption"><strong>HOCK TROUGH GATE.</strong></p>      <img src="../images/043-126-01-hog-trough-gate.jpg" alt="043-126-01-hog-trough-gate.jpg" width="147" height="75" />    </div>    <p>      To keep hogs from piling into the trough when swill is      being poured in, the following will do for a few hogs.      Where the trough is over 12 feet it is hard to manipulate      the gate, because they pile against it.    </p>    <p>      The trough is secured between two solid posts so hey can't      root it away, because it is a part of the yard or pen      fence. Fit a gate of 1x4 stuff as shown. The top rail is      just long enough to work freely between the posts. It rests      in a notched piece at C at each end, and is kept from being      rooted out by pieces D. This enables the gate to swing      freely over the trough. It must be kept some way from      swinging past either edge of trough more than is necessary      to drop the catches A A. These slide freely between two      slats and are held in place by pieces B B at top and      bottom. A short trough needs only one catch A. Which is      then placed in the middle of gate.. To operate two catches      at once when hogs are crowding for feed, make some latch      raisers out of two pieces of lath as shown. These are      pivoted on the slats nest A and work on a bolt or screw in      A, being slotted a, little to allow play. Push down on the      long ends with one hand while you switch the hogs off the      gate and the gate is released swings to the other side of      trough.    </p>		</div>    <h3>AGRICULTURE</h3>    <p>      <em>The farmers of the country are requested to contribute      to this Department.</em>    </p>    <h3>Dairying.</h3>    <p>      Many farmers now pursue the method of all the year round      dairying and find it a profitable one. With a fine product      of butter a ready market is assured at good prices. Dealers      like to find such producers for the reason that there is      then a supply right along that can be depended upon.    </p>    <p>      This is quite different from summer dairying when with the      advent of cold weather production ceases, leaving the      dealer to look somewhere else for a supply.    </p>    <p>      To be successful with winter dairying requires suitable      accommodations for the cows, the best kinds of forage and      such grain feeds as will add to the value of the daily      ration and all necessary care.    </p>    <p>      With these there should be little or no difficulty in      making a fine quality of butter during the winter months,      such as will be in quick demand at good prices. At this      season of the year the work can be well attended to and      found to be profitable. Where this practice is followed the      cows should come fresh in milk during late autumn or early      winter, or some for a more uniform supply of milk might      plan to have them distributed through the year.    </p>    <p>      Where what is termed winter dairying is followed there is a      good opportunity afforded for raising heifer calves for the      supply of the dairy or for sale. With warm, comfortable      quarters and properly fed and cared for, these will grow      finely and by another spring be large enough to turn to      pasture. This is an advantage that should not be      overlooked. And then when there is skimmed milk for the      purpose swine may he kept at a profit, as many have found      from experience.    </p>    <p>      Of course, all of this implies careful attention to all      details, but this should come within the province of the      wide-awake, up-to-date (farmer, who is willing and anxious      to do the best possible and is not afraid of the necessary      efforts for the desired success which he wishes to obtain,      and which is his by right as in the line of successful      farming.- <em>E. R. Towle,</em> <em>Franklin Co.,      Vt.</em>    </p>    <h3>BURYING BEES FOR WINTER.</h3>    <p>      My method of wintering bees is to bury them. I dig a trench      6 inches wider than the hive is long, and deep enough so      that with something to keep the hives from 4 to 6 inches      from the bottom, the hive is about one-third above ground.      I have always used 6-inch fence boards set on edge in the      bottom of the trench to set my hives on. This gives a,      6-inch space below the hives.    </p>    <p>      If one does not have the boards, 2x4 scantling will do as      well. I remove the bottom boards so that all bees that die      daring the winter fall into the bottom of the trench.    </p>    <p>      Place the hives close together, then cover with two feet of      straw, then throw on all the dirt from the trench and when      this is done, dig a. ditch on each side to carry off water,      throwing all the dirt over the bees. <em>Do</em> <em>not      leave any vent holes.</em> The ties won't smother.    </p>    <h3>Forest Preservation.</h3>    <p>      The American people are impulsive. They rush into things      for the almighty dollar without a thought for the future.      The pioneer slashed down the trees and burned them, then      later planted shade trees about his house. The timber      merchant laid waste the fine forests that he might be      wealthy.    </p>    <p>      The great advance in the price of lumber in recent years is      due to the lumber trust, the protective tariff and the      scarcity of trees, all three combined. Instead of learning      from other nations in regard to the forests, we, like      sheep, have done just as they.    </p>    <p>      Now the sentiment of the people has awakened an interest in      timber preservation and replanting of the denuded mountain      sides. The government has taken a firm hand in this matter      and the western ranch-men are up in wrath against the      department of forestry. They who made free pasture of the      mountain sides, thus killing the young trees that would      have reclothed the naked mountain range, think the      government has gone too far. But has it? Must the greed of      a few men cause havoc to hundreds of thousands who are      dependent upon the forests.    </p>    <p>      W e do not refer only to the lumber interests. We can build      out of steel and cement if need be. But forests play an      important part in the distribution of surface water and in      this way farmers for hundreds of miles from forests are      concerned. If these mountain sides once covered with trees      were now being cultivated the havoc would not be so great.    </p>    <p>      Trees grow clear to the perpetual snow line. They not only      prevent avalanches of snow and' ice but they form a mulch      that holds the melted snow water so that it does not rush      down the rocky sides, but percolates slowly through the      soil. Remove these and the soil soon washes away and the      big rain storms are rapidly carried down the rocks into the      ravines and canons in a great flood-head, carrying      death and destruction to everything in its way. Out upon      the plains the flood spreads beyond the river banks and      crops suffer for miles beyond the mountain ranges.    </p>    <p>      When the surface soil or mulch which the trees helped to      form is washed away what then can grow on the mountain      sides? What then will the rangeman do? He will have to      register his kick against a foolish fate rather than      against the government. But he must vacate just the same.    </p>    <p>      There are plenty of places to grow grass at a profit      without using the old forest lands. Trees can be grown      where no other crop but grass will grow. And good      agricultural lands are too valuable-to be turned into      government forest reservations. Tree protection is in the      interest of all humanity and land grabbing by the few      ranchmen is not.    </p>
