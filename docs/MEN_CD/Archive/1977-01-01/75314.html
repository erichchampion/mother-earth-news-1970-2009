        <p>Frozen pipes can sometimes be thawed with a vacuum cleaner. Simply use the appliance to blow air on the frigid pipe (or section of wall containing the pipe). The heat generated by the machine's motor will be enough to melt the frozen water.</p><p>A rubber eraser dipped in emery powder makes a great tool for cleaning rusted and/or corroded metal surfaces. ><br /></p><p>There's an easy way to prevent frost and condensation from forming in your car's or truck's gas tank: Just keep that tank full of fuel. If no air is allowed in the tank, no "dew" will form inside it . . . and your vehicle won't stall due to water in the gas. ><br /></p><p>Keep a few milk cartons filled with dry sand in your car's trunk . . . they'll help you get "unstuck" if you lose traction on an icy or snowy road.</p><p>Before you begin work on oily machinery, scrape your fingernails across the top of a bar of soap. That > way, you'll have clean nails before and after you finish the job.</p><p>If rats are a problem, put out a mixture of flour and cement along with a bowl of water. The rodents will eat the powder, become thirsty, drink the water, and-ultimately-die.</p>
