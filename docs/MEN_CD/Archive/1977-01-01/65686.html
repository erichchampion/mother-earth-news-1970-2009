                   		<p>    <strong>Right now-while the ground is covered with ice    and snow?is the time to hie down to the workshop and whip out    one of these simple little outdoor brooders. Then, when    you're ready to raise that mini-flock of homestead chicks    next spring or summer, you'll be all set?just like Linda and    Bill Bayliss of Pleasant Lake, Michigan?to handle the job in    style.</strong>    </p>    <p>Most homesteaders would never think of crowding their    laying hens together in a cramped, windowless enclosure (the    way today's commercial poultrymen do). And yet, a good many    small-scale farmers willingly foster just such conditions    when it comes to raising chicks.</p>    <p>      Not us. After years of experimentation, we've developed a      system that allows us to rear small groups of late spring      or summer peepers (no more than 25 at a time) in natural      surroundings, with or without a setty hen. Our secret: We      start our chicks in portable outdoor brooders.    </p>    <p>      An outdoor; "peep box" like the one in the accompanying      photo can be made simply and inexpensively from scrap      lumber, a couple of hinges, a porcelain light fixture, and      a screen or iron grating (the rack from an old      refrigerator, for instance). Our brooders cost us only      about a dollar each to build, since we're able to scrounge      all their parts except for the hinges and light fixtures.      (Even if you end up buying new lumber, however, your total      cost per brood box shouldn't be more than $6.00 or $7.00.)    </p>        <p>      Each of the frames we build is divided into two sections:      [1] a large run that's screened on the top and open at the      bottom, and [2] an adjoining, fully enclosed, brooding area      with an entrance to the run at one end, a light bulb for      heat at the other, and a hinged top.    </p>    <p>      The exact dimensions of your finished brooder (or brooders)      will depend on the size of wire rack you use over each run.      Ours measure 9" deep by 40" by 40" (with 12" down one side      of the square for the enclosed and heated box). Try not to      make your frame too much larger than this, or you'll      sacrifice one of the design's most important features:      portability.    </p>    <p>      If you're raising only a few chicks?or the weather's      warm?you can use a bantam hen to warm your babies.      Otherwise?like us?you'll want to mount a porcelain light      socket in the brooding compartment and vary the wattage of      its bulb according to the season. (Your chicks will then      automatically choose the most comfortable location between      the bulb and the entrance to the outside run.)    </p>    <p>      If you do install a light socket, be sure to place it high      enough so that the baby chickens can't (until they've      outgrown the brooder) touch its bulb. (Of course, as soon      as the little cheepers are well feathered out they won't      need the heat anymore and you can disconnect the light      fixture entirely.) Make certain also that you use an      outdoor-type extension cord and wrap all plugs with      electrical tape to minimize the danger of shocks?to you      <em>or</em> your birds?in wet weather.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of soggy weather, these outdoor brooders are?as      you might expect?especially vulnerable to sudden downpours      . . . which means you'll want to ensure good drainage by I      [1] putting the boxes on a slight slope and [2] drilling a      few 1/4" holes in the heated compartment's floor. During      periods of continuous wet conditions, we further recommend      that you set a glass window-instead of the screen or      grating?over the open portion of the frame.    </p>    <p>      When you first put your one- or two-day-old peepers in      their new home, place their food and water in the heated      area . . . then, as soon as they learn to venture out into      the run, move the rations outside to minimize dampness in      the brooding section. And don't worry: Despite their tiny      brains, even small chicks know enough to go inside and dry      off if the grass is too wet and when it rains.    </p>    <p>      Once the birds are big enough to fly-when they're      about four weeks old?we open the hinged grate and let the      peepers out into our fenced?off garden, where they seek out      and eat the bugs that'd otherwise seek out and eat our      plants. Naturally, we have to make sure the cats are in the      house when we do this, and we do see that the chicks go      back into their coop every night. (The birds are usually      very cooperative.)    </p>    <p>      One of the chief advantages of our outdoor brooders is that      they allow chicks to begin to forage from the first day      they're in their new home. This not only prevents      cannibalism, but makes the little cheepers grow up bold and      healthy. (Chicks raised this way will venture out in the      coldest weather to peck at the grass . . . and since the      brooder can be moved to a fresh, clean piece of ground      every day or two and kept separate from the main flock of      grown-ups?the tiny birds rarely become ill.) We've noticed,      too, that our young chickens seldom develop harmful      "pecking orders".    </p>    <p>      Another good thing about our modular brooder approach is      that if a fire should happen to break out it would be      confined to one frame and would not devour a whole barn.      (The one time we did have a brooder fire, the wood was so      damp that it only smoldered, and the chicks escaped      unharmed into the run.) To minimize the danger of even one      of these small blazes, of course, we suggest you use      fireproof litter and keep it well away from each frame's      light bulb.    </p>    <p>      As for protection against predators, our coops have      thwarted attacks by wily foxes, raccoons, dogs, cats, and      owls. Feline attackers <em>will</em> reach under the edge      of a frame to grab a feathery snack if given the chance,      though, so it's important that you always set your brooders      on fairly smooth ground. (We also put a 2" ledge around the      inside bottoms of our boxes to further discourage cats.)    </p>    <p>      When your babies are grown, you can use their former home      as a makeshift cold frame to protect semi-hardy herbs      through the winter, see a few tomatoes past the first fall      frost, or harden off indoor-started annuals prior to      transplanting them to the garden.    </p>    <p>      We're delighted with our portable chick brooders (all of      which have endured eight winters outside without rotting or      falling apart). If there's an easier, less expensive,      <em>healthier</em> way to house growing chicks, we haven't      found it!    </p>
