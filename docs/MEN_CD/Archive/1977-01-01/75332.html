                     			    <p>      <strong>Friends of the Earth is one of the most effective      environmental groups in the world today. Although FOE      publishes its own journal-a monthly tabloid called      Not</strong> <strong>Man Apart?far too few of MOTHER's      readers regularly see a copy of <em>NMA</em> . . . which is      why we've agreed to publish this column, written by the      FOE/ <em>NMA</em> staff.</strong>    </p>    <h3>THE ELECTION: WIN A FEW, LOSE A FEW</h3>    <p>      Never, since the environmental movement came into its own,      have its leaders united so strongly in a presidential      campaign as they did during the Carter/Ford struggle. Jimmy      Carter?who espoused a good many sound environmental      policies?won nearly unanimous endorsement from      ecology-minded groups and individuals. And?as it turned      out?the many conservationists (including much of the staff      of Friends of the Earth) who took leaves of absence during      October to work for the former Georgia Governor's election      got what they wanted.    </p>    <p>      In House and Senate races, the conservationists' candidates      fared somewhat worse. Only three of the Dirty Dozen      (Talcott of California, Clancy of Ohio, and Johnson of      Pennsylvania) were defeated, although 10 of the 16      candidates endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters      won their contests. Perhaps the best news is that Sam      Steiger (D-Ariz.)-for years one of the most      consistent and outspoken opponents of environmental      legislation in Congress?failed in his bid to capture the      Senate seat vacated by retiring Paul Fannin.    </p>    <p>      Thanks largely to a last?minute barrage of industry      sponsored TV commercials, all six nuclear initiatives voted      on last November were defeated (despite the fact that      opinion polls showed most of the measures doing well up to      the week before the election). Here's how the voting went:    </p>		    <p>      Montana's initiative was the toughest of the six: It would      have banned nukes altogether. Yet, in spite of the fact      that the measure's opponents spent $300,000 in campaign      money to the proponents' $300, a whopping 45% of Montana's      voters approved the proposition . . . by far the greatest      percentage of "yes" votes cast in any state. Not enough to      put the initiative over, of course, but a very respectable      showing on a shoestring budget.    </p>    <p>      (As a side note, Missouri voters ratified a measure that      will outlaw the present utility company practice of      charging customers for "construction work in progress".      Since nuclear power plant construction is more costly than      the development of other types of power, the new law is      expected to hamper nuke construction.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, voters in four states had a chance to decide on      Oregon-style "bottle bills". Here, the outcome was more      encouraging: two wins and two losses. (The :victories took      place in Maine and Michigan . . . the defeats, in      Massachusetts and Colorado.)    </p>    <p>      As someone once said, you win a few . . . and you lose a      few.    </p>    <h3>FLOWER POWER</h3>    <p>      For years, conservationists have been doing battle with the      Army Corps of Engineers over a stretch of the St. John      River in Maine. The Corps wants to build a $600 million      hydroelectric dam on the river . . . while opponents of the      dam want to save the river for canoeing, wilderness      exploration, and such.    </p>    <p>      Now, in the eleventh hour, a new warrior bas joined the      fray: the furbish lousewort. Until the dam controversy      flared up, the lousewort?a variety of wild      snapdragon-was thought to be extinct. But lo! It's      not extinct after all: 36 of the rare plants have been      discovered right where the Corps wants to pave the      riverbanks with concrete . . . which makes the lousewort an      <em>endangered species.</em> And, under the provisions of      the Endangered Species Act, the federal government can't      legally spend money to wipe out the lousewort . . . so the      dam project is?for the moment-stymied.    </p>    <p>      No doubt the situation will change, but in the meantime      it's amusing to think that the mighty Corps of Engineers      could be held at bay by?of all things?the furbish      lousewort!    </p>    <h3>RUSSIAN NUCLEAR DISASTER</h3>    <p>      <em>Some</em> kind of nuclear disaster took place in Russia      in the late 50's, but no one on this side of the globe      knows for sure yet exactly what happened. The flap started      with the publication in the British journal, <em>New      Scientist</em> , of a report by a Soviet scientist (now      living in London) who claims that a nuclear waste dump in      his country exploded some years ago, killing hundreds of      people and poisoning thousands more. This report was      followed by an article in <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> ,      in which an unidentified American "intelligence expert" is      quoted as saying that what happened was not a waste      explosion, but a reactor core meltdown. (Doesn't that make      you feel better?)    </p>    <p>      Maybe we'll know the whole story one day . . . maybe not.      It just makes us wonder how many other disasters of similar      magnitude are known to the American intelligence community      . . . and how the Russians could keep such a tragedy quiet      all these years.    </p>    <h3>BRIEF NOTES</h3>    <p>      Nuclear Fuels Services of West Valley, New York has thrown      in the towel: They will abandon their multimillion-dollar      reprocessing plant as a total loss . . . . Sweden's Social      Democrats?voted out of power for the first time in 40      years?have been replaced by a three?party coalition led by      Tørbjorn Fålldin, who ran an anti-nuclear      campaign . . . . The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences      warns that the continued massive use of nitrogen      fertilizers?which cause the release of nitrous oxide from      the soil-may lead to a depletion of the ozone layer      and an increase in skin cancers . . . . The U.S. Army has      petitioned the Department of Defense for permission to      bombard 119,580 acres of central California with sodium      fluoroacetate (1080)?one of the most deadly chemicals known      to man?in an attempt to reduce the ground squirrel      population.    </p>    <p>      <em>To become a member of Friends of the Earth?and receive      their excellent publication,</em> Not Man Apart <em>, dear      round-remit $20 to FOE at 529 Commercial St., San      Francisco, Calif. 94111.?MOTHER.</em>    </p>
