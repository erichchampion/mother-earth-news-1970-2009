                    		<h5 id="byline"> By Randy Kidd, D.V.M.</h5>					    <p>      IN MY PRACTICE I'VE SEEN count less animals and their      owners, and nearly every type of pet known to man-from      Great Pyrenees dogs to Persian cats, from panthers to      pythons, hamsters to hogs.    </p>    <p>      At our house, too, we've had a constant parade of animal      guests, ranging from the mundane to the mysterious-all of      them loved. So it's with a plethora of pet experience that      I offer the following tips on how to select the pet that'll      best fit your home sanctuary.    </p>    <p>      Now, I'm going to approach this subject in a manner that      you might find unusual. You see, I feel that in a      compatible person/pet relationship, the animal's      personality mirrors the owner's and vice versa. So it's my      opinion that when deciding on what kind of pet you want,      you need to look within to see the kind of person you are.    </p>    <p>      Are you affectionate to a fault? Do you feel a real need to      be around friends often? Do you tend to be enthusiastic,      active? If these characteristics fit you, you're a prime      candidate for a dog-or most dogs, anyway. Dogs vary widely      not only in their size and in the amount of "fur" they      carry, but also in personality traits. Some breeds tend to      be more outgoing than others, some less active, some      friendly and some downright temperamental.    </p>    <p>      If you enjoy quiet and relaxation, if you like affection      but don't feel a constant need for it, you're a likely cat      person. If you are exuberant at times and have a flair for      humor, a bird may be your best choice. And don't overlook      the other pets when you're trying to matchmake yourself. At      one point I was a turtle person; it was a time in my life      when I needed to learn how to calm myself, to become more      meditative. My turtle's unblinking eyes and slow, barely      discernible breathing were my teachers, my mirror into the      inner self.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Care and Keeping?</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you've looked within to find the kind of pet      personality that's right for you, take another look-but      this time at your pocketbook and other practical factors.      Be honest with yourself. Realistically, how much care and      attention can you offer? Your own and your family's needs      come first, of course. How much time, patience and money do      you have left over for a pet?    </p>    <p>      Some animals require a great deal of time and attention.      Consider a pooch, for example. Those first few months of      training a pup to be an acceptable member of human society      can be nearly a full-time job. And, though dog-training      chores gradually diminish as the animal learns the whys and      ways of mankind, the training never really ends. You have,      after all, accepted with a pup the responsibility to tend      an animal that will never progress beyond the unbridled      exuberance (and inherent destructiveness) of the average      two-year-old child.    </p>    <p>      Though no pet is care-free, some types require much less      care and keeping than others. My advice to you is to      honestly appraise the amount of extra time and energy you      have (don't rely on the spouse or your youngsters; it's      best to assume that all the pet chores will fall in your      lap). Then weigh that excess against the amount of care      that a pet you're considering will require every day, seven      days a week. If you don't know how much care and keeping to      expect from a particular type or breed of animal, ask your      veterinarian or someone who has raised and trained one      (don't ask the person trying to sell the critter to you).    </p>    <p>      And then there's the expense of pet care. Like they say,      "It ain't the price of the marriage certificate that's so      high; it's all that upkeep afterwards." Pet prices vary      from free to several thousand dollars. You pick your own      entry level, but whatever the initial price tag, it will be      only the beginning. Consider the hidden costs involved with      a dog, for example. There's the doghouse and pen, the      leash, rawhide bones, flea powder, shampoos, chew toys, the      grooming, the food dishes-and the food itself.    </p>    <p>      And the vet bill gets added to all that. I tell owners to      set aside $50 to $100 per year on average for a dog's      veterinary expenses, a little less for a cat. That'll cover      most routine expenses here in Kansas, where I practice. But      if you live in a more expensive area, or if your pet      requires unusual or emergency treatment, your vet bills can      skyrocket.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>How Much Space?</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      OK, let's say that your heart, the amount of time you have      and your pocketbook are all big enough for a pet. The next      question is: Do you have enough room?    </p>    <p>      If you live in a one-room studio apartment, obviously      you'll need to look for a pet that is content in small      spaces. A reptile terrarium, a fluff of hamster or gerbil,      a bird or perhaps a cat are reasonable choices. And don't      overlook fish. An aquarium of fish will, in exchange for a      periodic feeding and a modest amount of attention to water      purity, provide you an amazing amount of soothing and      calming energy through the fishes' watery comings and      goings.    </p>    <p>      If, on the other hand, your manse sits in the middle of a      full section of rural land, your pet horizons are far      greater and include many a different species and breed of      animal.    </p>    <p>      The key point to keep in mind here is that a pet is your-      and only your-responsibility. Many people, when deciding on      a pet, tend to look only at what the pet can offer them.      It's important to keep your expectations in mind, of      course-after all, if you're looking for an animal that will      faithfully guard your belongings, a gerbil clearly will not      do. But it's also important to honestly assess what you      have to offer-in personality, time, budget and space. Know      thyself, and you'll know what kind of pet will be happiest      sharing your life.    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Dr. Kidd, a long-time contributor to MOTHER EARTH      NEWS, is a Kansas-based veterinarian with a special      interest in holistic health care for animals and their      owners.</em></em>    </p>
