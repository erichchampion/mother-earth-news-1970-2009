                    		<h5 id="byline">By Carol Taylor </h5>    <p>      Celebrate the season with home-baked harvest pies.    </p>        <p>      AH, SEPTEMBER SONGS: THE RHYTHMIC whisper of dry leaves,      the staccato crackle of the year's first fires, the basso      rumble of school buses, the reedy whine of family and      friends-"Are you <em>ever</em> going to bake us another      pie?"    </p>    <p>      Autumn seems to orchestrate a return to the kitchen, to      lure us back to the stove. With cooler days and nights,      heating up the oven becomes a pleasure. Gone are the hectic      days of late-summer canning and freezing, when we swore      that if we ever got the garden cleaned out we'd never set      foot in a kitchen again; cooking for pleasure becomes      conceivable once more. An abundant harvest bids us put it      to use, and its beauty-the brilliant colors, elegant shapes      and rich s cents of apples, pears, pumpkins, grapes-inspires      us to create something splendid.    </p>    <p>      And all around us, people trumpet their encouragement. They      flatter. ("The restaurant's apple pie was adequate, of      course, but compared to <em>yours...") They</em> wheedle.      ("Just one more little pumpkin pie wouldn't be much work.")      They bribe. ("OK, what if I did all the dishes for three      full days?") And, ultimately, they plead. ("Ple-ease!")    </p>    <p>      The reason for this cacophony is that sooner or later all      bakers tire of the same tune: After preparing the third      apple pie of the season, the fourth just isn't much of a      challenge. How do we harmonize the mundane cravings of our      nearest and dearest with our longing to hum new melodies?    </p>    <p>      Tarts: Traditional enough to substitute for old standbys,      jazzy enough to keep the cook interested, they're pretty      enough to serve as fitting anthems to a beautiful season.    </p>    <p>      ESSENTIALLY, A TART IS A SINGLE crust pie baked in a tart      pan, a two-part contraption consisting of a fluted metal      ring that forms the sides, and a flat disk that forms a      removable bottom. The bottom fits within the ring and rests      on a narrow lip attached to its lower edge. After the tart      has cooked and cooled, the ring is removed by placing the      pan on a surface smaller than itself (e.g., a Mason jar)      and guiding the ring down to the counter, leaving an      attractive, fluted, freestanding crust. Contrary to your      darkest expectations, the ring does in fact come away      easily; the crust shrinks enough during baking to prevent      any sticking or tearing. (Allegedly, the tart can also be      removed from the bottom disk onto a separate serving      platter, using a rimless baking sheet as a giant spatula.      I've never summoned the courage to attempt this maneuver;      if you do, let me know how it turns out.)    </p>    <p>      Tart pans are available for under $5 from kitchen specialty      shops, and range from three- or four-inch individual molds      to the standard eight-, nine-, 10- and 11-inch pans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Embarrassing admission no. 1:</strong> It is      astonishingly difficult to remember that if you lift a tart      pan from the bottom (or with one hand), it will obligingly      come apart. There is no wrong time to remember this law of      physics, but the very best moment is when removing a hot      pie from the oven. Always use both hands, placed on      opposite sides of the ring.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Pastry</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      As every beginning baker knows, a good pie crust has two      essential characteristics: It's tender, and it's flaky. A      few simple techniques will produce those results.    </p>    <p>      The bane of good pastry is gluten, a stringlike protein      found in most flours. While essential to bread baking (its      long, elastic threads form a framework that supports the      expanding air bubbles in the rising loaf), gluten produces      a dense, tough pie crust if allowed to develop. So the two      things that activate gluten-warmth and handling-are good      for bread and bad for pies. Crusts turn out better if all      ingredients are cold (especially the fat), if the working      surface is cool, if the dough is refrigerated before it's      rolled and if it spends as little time in your warm hands      as possible. The same precautions help produce flakiness,      which results when small particles of fat and flour remain      discrete; handling and heat tend to melt the fat, thus      dispersing it uniformly through the flour and harming the      crust. (This is why oil is not a satisfactory fat for pie      crusts.)    </p>    <p>      For dessert tarts, the traditional (and best) crust is a      short dough sweetened with sugar and enriched with an egg      yolk. The bad news about this crust (which tastes something      like shortbread and is almost good enough to eat by itself      is that it tears fairly easily when you're rolling it out,      because it's so rich. The good news is that it's child's      play to patch.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Short, Sweet Pastry</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 1/4 cups all purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 cup (1      stick) cold unsalted butter 2 tablespoons ice water 1 egg      yolk, lightly beaten    </p>    <p>      Combine dry ingredients in large bowl. With two sharp      knives or a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture      resembles coarse meal. Mix egg yolk with ice water, add to      bowl, and stir quickly with fork, just until moisture is      absorbed. If dough will not hold together, add more ice      water, a teaspoon at a time, until you can form dough into      a ball. Gather up dough, flatten into a disk, wrap in foil      or plastic wrap, and refrigerate 30 minutes.    </p>    <p>      On a lightly floured board or counter top, roll pastry to a      thickness of 1/8 inch. Roll it up loosely over the rolling      pin, then unroll it onto the tart pan. Lifting the edges of      the crust, fit it into the pan, tucking it into the bottom      creases and pressing it into the flutes along the sides.      (Don't stretch the dough, or it will simply shrink back      when baked.) Trim pastry by rolling the rolling pin across      the top of the pan. Chill until ready to use (your final      chance to relax the gluten). Makes enough pastry for one      eight- to 11-inch tart.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Embarrassing admission no. 2:</strong> In testing      recipes for this article, I made the crust described above      for the first few tarts; it drew compliments. As deadline      approached and shortcuts beckoned, I bought a Pillsbury All      Ready Pie Crust, which I considered too salty and not sweet      enough for a tart crust. (Ignore the crust, I was prepared      to say, just taste the filling.) It drew compliments. On      the spot, I concluded that if the people I cook for have no      particular preference between a crust that takes an hour to      make and one that requires 30 seconds, I may well have      rolled my last piece of dough. If you also cook for      nonpurists, you might want to investigate this      unfold-and-bake product.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Blind baking.</strong> Caution: Don't start blind      baking your pie crusts-partially pre-baking an empty      shell-unless you are prepared to continue for the rest of      your cooking career. The crust will be so much firmer and      crisper that you will never be content with a soggy bottom      again. Particularly useful with liquid or custard fillings,      blind baking is, fortunately, simple and fast.    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Place pastry in tart pan, line      with foil-shiny side down, so as not to reflect the      heat-and fill with dry beans, pushing them into the bottom      edges. (The beans can be stored and used repeatedly.) Bake      about 15 minutes, until bottom is set and sides are lightly      browned. If the filling is particularly runny, add a second      step: Brush the bottom with a beaten egg yolk, and bake      another two minutes, until glaze is dry. Your crust is now      ready to be filled and baked.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Apple Tart</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      1 8- or 9-inch tart shell, partially baked 2 pounds cooking      apples 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup apricot jam, divided 1/3 cup      plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided Grated rind of 1 lemon      1/4 cup apple brandy 1 pound eating apples 2 tablespoons      lemon juice, divided    </p>    <p>      Peel, core, and coarsely chop cooking apples. (If you have      a food processor, leave apples unpeeled; when cooked and      processed, the puree will have an attractive pink color and      a greater depth of flavor. Without a processor, separating      out the cooked peel is difficult, although it can be done.)      Melt butter in medium saucepan, add apples, cover, and cook      until soft and mushy. Mash apples with vegetable masher,      process, or rub through sieve until smooth. Add 1/4 cup of      the apricot jam, 1/3 cup of the sugar, lemon rind and apple      brandy. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until      excess liquid has evaporated and applesauce is thick. Set      aside to cool. Meanwhile, peel, core, and thinly slice      eating apples. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice      and 2 tablespoons remaining sugar. Spoon applesauce into      partially baked tart shell, and arrange apple slices in an      overlapping circle around the edge of the tart, then      arrange second and third circles inside that. Bake at      350Â°F 25-30 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Combine remaining      1/4 cup apricot jam with remaining 1 tablespoon lemon      juice, stir over medium heat 2-3 minutes, strain, and,      while still warm, paint apple slices with glaze. Serve warm      or chilled.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Caramelized Pear Tart</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      3/4 cup sugar 3 tablespoons water 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick)      unsalted butter, cut in pieces 6-8 firm pears Pastry for      single crust, unbaked*    </p>    <p>      Place sugar and water in 8- or 9-inch cast-iron skillet.      Bring to boil and cook over medium-high heat, stirring      occasionally but not constantly. Mixture will first      dissolve, then foam, then thicken and turn a deep, rich      amber-brown. At that point, remove it from the heat and      stir in butter. You should now have caramel.    </p>    <p>      If you lift a tart pan by the bottom, it will obligingly      come apart.    </p>    <p>      Peel, quarter, and core the pears. Arrange them in      concentric circles, cut side up, on top of the caramel in      the skillet. (Keep in mind that the tart will be inverted      before it is served; the fruit on the bottom will be      visible.) Continue layering pears until pan is full.    </p>    <p>      Return skillet to stove and cook over low heat for about 20      minutes, until syrup thickens and is reduced by half. (Take      care that the caramel doesn't burn.) Remove from heat.      Place crust over skillet and trim, leaving about 1/2 inch      over sides of pan. Tuck edges down into skillet around      pears. Bake at 375Â°F 20-30 minutes, until crust is      golden brown. Cool on rack 20 minutes, then loosen pastry      from sides of pan with sharp knife, if necessary. Place      serving dish over tart and invert quickly (and carefully).      Serve immediately.    </p>    <p>      *For this tart, which requires a firmer crust, omit the      sugar and egg yolk and add 1/2 teaspoon salt.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Embarrassing admission no. 3:</strong> I ruined      three of these. (MOTHER'S publisher is perhaps the first to      record a deficit under the heading "Pears.") General      irritability led me to try a fourth, which was pretty and      delicious. The tart is actually simple to make, assuming      you avoid all of the pitfalls into which I dashed headlong.      1) Some cookbooks suggest lemon juice instead of water in      the caramel. This produces a bitter undertaste and such      comments as "Well, it certainly looks nice." Use water. It      was good enough for Julia Child. 2) Don't try to make      caramel over medium-low heat. The water will simply      evaporate, leaving you with a pile of wet sugar. For the      sugar and water to caramelize, you need medium-high heat.      After you add the butter, the substance in the pan should      look, smell and taste like caramel. If it looks and tastes      like a mixture of sugar, water and butter, start over; it      is not going to caramelize while it simmers on the stove      another 20 minutes. Trust me. Save yourself some pears. 3)      Don't rush the final resting time; let the tart stand a      full 20 minutes before inverting it. Otherwise, the sauce      won't have time to re-thicken, and when you flip the tart,      you'll caramelize your kitchen. 4) Even caramel that      refuses to harden under any other circumstances will become      as rock when it hits a hot stove. Wipe up spills      immediately.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Pumpkin Bourbon Tart</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      1 10- or 11 -inch tart shell, partially baked 2 eggs,      slightly beaten 2 cups thick pumpkin puree (or 1 16-ounce      can pumpkin) 3/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1      teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4      teaspoon ground cloves or allspice 10 ounces evaporated      milk (1 12-ounce can minus 2 ounces) 2 ounces bourbon    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Mix ingredients in order listed.      Pour into tart shell. Place tart in oven; immediately      reduce heat to 350Â°. Bake 30-45 minutes, or until knife      inserted in filling comes out clean. Cool completely, and      serve with whipped cream, if desired. Makes enough filling      for 1 tart plus 2 or 3 custard cups of flavorful puree.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Maple Pecan Tart</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar 2 eggs 1 /3 cup      light corn syrup 1/3 cup maple syrup 1/3 cup whipping cream      3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoon salt 1      1/2 cups pecans, coarsely chopped    </p>    <p>      Whisk together eggs and brown sugar. Whisk in syrups, then      cream, butter and salt. Place rack in upper third of oven      and preheat to 325Â°F. Spread pecans in crust. Rewhisk      filling and ladle over pecans. Bake 40 minutes. Cool on      rack 30 minutes, then remove tart and ring. Allow tart to      cool completely before serving. Serve with whipped cream if      desired.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Cranberry Tart</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      1 10-inch tart shell, completely baked and cooled* 2      envelopes unflavored gelatin 1/2 cup cold water 6 cups (3      12-ounce packages) fresh cranberries 1 3/4-2 cups sugar, to      taste 1 cup red currant jelly 2 tablespoons cognac    </p>    <p>      Soften gelatin in water. Combine cranberries, sugar, jelly      and cognac in saucepan, and cook over low heat for 10      minutes. Do not overcook or mixture will become too watery;      cranberries should be soft but not bursting. Remove from      heat and let cool slightly. Stir in gelatin and let cool      completely. Pour cranberry filling into tart shell, and      chill for at least 1 hour.    </p>    <p>      *To completely bake shell, follow directions for blind      baking, but bake 20-25 minutes.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>MACHINE-AGE DOUGH</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      WHEN GREAT-AUNT ALICE GAVE you a food processor for your      birthday and listed its virtues, she concluded, "And it      makes a real nice pie crust, too." Admit it: Outwardly you      were gracious; inwardly you snickered. Chopping onions,      perhaps, and shredding cabbage, of course, but making a pie      crust? Never.    </p>    <p>      Call Great-Aunt Alice and apologize.    </p>    <p>      A food processor allows you to make exactly the kind of      crust you want while cutting the hassle by about 90%.      Moreover, it makes a better crust than most of us do by      hand. It doesn't roll the doughnut, of course (one would      think the manufacturers would have added this feature by      now), but that's a minor chore compared to cutting the fat      into the dry ingredients. That's what the processor does      superbly-in a fraction of the time, before the butter warms      or your arms tire. If you have time to chill all the      ingredients, so much the better. If not, make sure that the      butter and the water are ice cold.    </p>    <p>      Put the dry ingredients in the processor bowl, cut the      butter into small pieces, and add it. Process for eight to      10 seconds, or just until mixture resembles coarse meal.      Next, with the machine running, add the yolk and then the      ice water, a few drops at a time, just until the dough      holds together without being sticky or wet; don't process      more than 30 seconds. Check the dough. If it's too crumbly,      add a few drops of water; if it's too wet, add a teaspoon      of flour. Place dough on sheet of plastic wrap or foil,      flatten into a disk, wrap, refrigerate 30 minutes, and make      a note that great-aunts are smarter than they used to be.    </p>    <p>      PHOTOGRAPHS BY CLAYTON CRANBERRY TART RECIPE FROM MARTHA      STEWART'S PIES & TARTS, RECIPIES COPYRIGHT Â© 1985      BY MARTHA STEWART, INC.
