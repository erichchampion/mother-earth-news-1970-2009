                        <p>      It's worth putting in a turnip patch just to enjoy a      "potlikker" dish.    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Sara Pacher</h5>        <p>      THE TURNIP HAS, WITH GOOD REASON, been a staple of the      human diet for millenniums. Evidence found near Beijing,      China, indicates prehistoric cave dwellers wrapped turnip      ice; in ferns or wild onions and steamed them in wet leaves      placed on t stones in the fire. Cave paint created several      thousand years later heap Aurignac, France, show turnips      being boiled in clay pots.    </p>    <p>      Our Cro-Magnon ancestors apparently foraged these plants      from the wild, but by 3500 B.C.., Sumerians in the valley      of the Euphrates were cultivating the vegetable. In later,      centuries; Greeks and Romans turned turnip cooking into a      culinary art form, and forums were held to discuss the best      ways to -prepare the vegetable. Some epicures liked diem      pickled; others preserved the roots in myrtle berries,      honey and vinegar. One Roman method involved steaming      turnips successively with cumin, rue and benzoin (a      fragrant, balsamic resin). After being cooked for several      hours, the vegetable was then mashed and simmered in honey,      vinegar, gravy, boiled grapes and a little oil. Ancients      might have considered this complicated dish delicious, but      I see no reason to disguise the deliciously pungent taste      of turnips. In fact, a favorite Saturday night supper of my      south Georgia childhood consisted of cornbread crumbled      into "potlikker"-in this case, the leftover liquid from      cooking turnip greens. To me, it's worth putting in a      turnip patch just to enjoy this down-home dish whenever I      like, though turnips <em>(Brassica rapa)</em> and rutabagas      <em>(Brassica napobrassica)</em> reward a grower in other      ways.    </p>    <p>      First of all, they're very nutritious. A serving of turnip      tops steamed in a little water, while containing only 20      calories, gives you 184 milligrams of calcium and 6,300      units of vitamin A, along with significant amounts of      phosphorus, iron, thiamin, riboflavin and niacin, as well      as 69 milligrams of vitamin C. (The only vegetable      containing more vitamin C is parsley.) Rutabaga greens, at      35 calories a serving, offer a little less of most of these      nutrients, but add 167 milligrams of potassium. Eaten      raw-and the tender leaves of both these vegetables are a      tasty addition to salads-they are even better for you. The      roots, while not quite as nutritious, still have the same      vitamin content as potatoes and are richer in vitamin C.    </p>    <p>      Best of all, turnips and rutabagas are easy to grow and      store and are relatively pest-free. Much of the crop's      success depends on timing.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>What and How to Grow</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Like those other brassicas, cabbages and Brussels sprouts,      turnips and rutabagas are cool-weather crops. The rutabaga      is actually a horticultural cross between a turnip and a      cabbage; it was created by Swiss botanist Gaspard Bauhin in      the seventeenth century, though it didn't arrive in this      country until 1806. Rutabagas are commonly called fall or      Swedish turnips or simply Swedes. (Because of their liking      for cool, glacial soil, they're widely grown and eaten in      Sweden and other northern countries.) Additionally,      rutabagas can tolerate frost better than turnips, and the      roots can be stored for up to a year.    </p>    <p>      Whether you're growing turnips or rutabagas, these      underground brassicas should be planted about three weeks      before the last frost date in early spring or, for a      (usually better) fall crop, in midsummer. They also are a      winter crop in the warmer sections of the South.    </p>    <p>      If you want to keep these root crops growing quickly, water      is the secret.    </p>    <p>      The main thing to keep in mind is that these vegetables      require temperatures of between 50° and 70°F to      mature, so select a variety with growing needs that      correspond to your local climate. (The soil must be at      least 40°F for seed germination, which generally takes      from seven to 14 days.) Hot weather will turn the leaves      rank and make the roots woody and bitter.    </p>    <p>      The most popular turnip is the fine-tasting, fine-storing      Purple Top White Globe, which matures in 55 to 58 days and      is best for a fall crop. The Japanese, however, have come      up with several varieties that mature much faster. For      example, the hybrid Just Right (40 days) is remarkable for      its tender greens and roots, while the two-inch root of      virus resistant Tokyo Cross is ready to eat in only 35      days. Shogoin (30 days), another Japanese offering, is      cultivated primarily for its thick, delicious foliage, and      if you can nurture your crop for 70 days, its roots are      tasty, too. Some turnips, such as Seven Top, are grown only      for their greens. Turnip roots can be white or yellow, and,      though turnips are classified according to the shape of      their roots-flat, round or cylindrical-shape doesn't make a      great deal of difference in their taste. Their tops come in      shades of green, red, purple and gold. Certain white      varieties with green tops have proved to be the hardiest.    </p>    <p>      Rutabagas generally take 90 days to mature. Macomber (80      days) and American Purple Top (88 to 90 days) are old      favorites.    </p>    <p>      Turnips and rutabagas are fairly tough crops that can be      grown in almost any type of soil, but they thrive best in      loose, organically rich, stone-free, water-retentive but      well-drained earth that's been worked deeply. The pH should      be between 6.5 and 7.0. Phosphorus (try ground rock      phosphate and granite dust) encourages root development.      Too much nitrogen will produce thick leaves but puny roots,      so don't fertilize with unrotted manure.    </p>    <p>      Because turnips and Swedes are such light feeders, they can      be rotated with heavy feeders like corn or squash. But      don't plant your crop near mustard greens, which will      inhibit its growth, or near other brassica cousins such as      broccoli or cabbage, since all family members are      susceptible to the same diseases. Turnips and rutabagas      can, however, tolerate partial shade, so some people like      to grow them between climbing peas. Any type of pea is a      good companion plant to these crops.    </p>    <p>      Neither of these root crops transplants well, so sow your      seeds where you intend to grow them. (One seed packet will      plant a 50foot row and will produce 25 pounds of leaves and      50 pounds of roots; the germination rate is over 70%, and      the seed will store from two to five years and can be      sprouted.) Sow your spring crop 1/4 inch deep; plant fall      crops 1/2 inch deep two months (three months for rutabagas)      before the first expected frost. Seeds may be broadcast and      later thinned to three or four inches apart, or they can be      planted in rows 18 or more inches apart. Give rutabaga      plants six inches in which to grow. (Use the tender      thinnings in salads.)    </p>    <p>      Keep down weeds and aerate the soil with hoeing and      hand-cultivating, and never, at any stage, allow the bed to      dry out. You want to keep these vegetables growing fast and      continuously, and water is the secret. Constant moisture      will produce a good, well-flavored, tender crop, while lack      of moisture will make the roots fibrous and strong-tasting      and will force the plant to send up a seed stalk. When the      leaves are about five inches long, you can mulch the plants      to keep weeds down and moisture in.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>What to Watch For</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      You'd expect turnips to be susceptible to all the pests and      diseases that attack other brassicas. Theoretically, they      are, but scientists have found that the turnip plant has an      insecticidal chemical compound in its system that helps      ward of such insects as aphids, spider mites, houseflies      and beetles. Therefore, root maggots are the most likely      cause of problems. They can be discouraged by scattering      wood ashes liberally around your plants. Should aphids or      flea beetles attack, use hard hose sprays, sticky traps,      garlic sprays, diatomaceous earth, wood ashes or ladybugs      (for aphids) to get rid of them.    </p>    <p>      The main disease to watch for is black rot, which turns      leaves black and foul-smelling. The only way to prevent      this bacterial menace is with strict crop rotation.      Specifically, don't put your turnip or rutabaga patch where      it or any other cole crop has grown within the last five      years, and immediately remove and destroy any diseased      plants to keep this plague from spreading.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>How to Harvest and Store</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Greens can be harvested as soon as they're large enough to      pick, but don't pluck any one plant too heavily or you'll      kill the root. Turnips should be pulled when the roots are      from one to three inches in diameter. (Usually, the smaller      they are, the tenderer they'll be. Very young ones make a      fine substitute for radishes and can be carved into      decorative garnishes.) To harvest the roots, use a spading      fork to loosen the soil around the base of the leaves, grab      the tops, and pull gently.    </p>    <p>      Rutabaga roots are much larger-and sweeter-than turnips,      but they should not be allowed to grow so big that they      become woody, otherwise they're more fit for cattle than      human consumption. However, because of their hardiness,      many people leave rutabagas in the ground during the      winter, rather than storing them, to be dug as needed.    </p>    <p>      Turnips are not as long-lasting as rutabagas, but in      mild-winter areas, they can be mulched and left in the      garden for an extended harvest. With both crops, though,      it's often better to pull up the roots, twist of the tops      (but not too closely; leave about '/z inch of stems) and      store them in layers in boxes of moist sand, sawdust or      peat, or in heaps or ridges covered with a layer of soil      and straw. Some people cover the roots in wax to prevent      dehydration and store them in an area just above freezing.      Others simply place them in any cool (32° to 40°F),      damp, dark place such as a basement or root cellar. Just      make sure you don't store any that are bruised, cut or      diseased.    </p>    <p>      If an early hot spell hits your spring crop, taste-test the      roots daily and harvest the entire crop at the first sign      of deterioration. Refrigerated, the greens will keep for up      to a week or can be frozen for future use. Store the roots      as mentioned above in a cool, moist place.    </p>    <p>      Freezing, which preserves the most nutrition, is the best      way to store turnip and rutabaga tops. Wash young, tender      green leaves in several changes of water, removing tough      stems or bruised leaves. Blanch each pound in two gallons      of boiling water for two minutes, stirring to keep the      greens from sticking together. Cool, drain well, and pack      into containers, leaving '/a inch of head space. Seal,      label, and freeze. When ready for use, cook for eight to 15      minutes.    </p>    <p>      The roots, while they don't can well, can also be frozen. I      find it easier just to store them in my cellar, but I do      like to add a diced root or two for flavor and texture in      each package of frozen greens.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Old-Fashioned Turnip      Greens</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      1 onion, chopped 3 strips bacon, cut into 2" pieces 1 small      clove garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper      Dash of vinegar 3 cups tightly packed chopped turnip greens      1 or 2 eggs, hard-boiled    </p>    <p>      Fill a large saucepan half-full of water and add onion,      bacon, garlic, salt, pepper and vinegar. Bring to a boil      for 1 minute. Add turnip greens.and cook until tender.      Drain (save the liquid), and top with sliced-egg garnish.      Serves 4 to 6. (For your next meal, reheat the cooking      liquid-called pot liquor in the South-pour into individual      bowls, add small chunks of cornbread, and enjoy!)    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Rutabaga Casserole</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      3 pounds rutabagas, peeled and diced 2 teaspoons brown      sugar (divided) 1/2 teaspoon dill seed 1 teaspoon salt 2      tablespoons margarine or butter 1/3 cup sour cream Place      rutabagas, 1 teaspoon sugar, dill seed and salt in about 1"      of boiling water, and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.      Drain, mash, and stir in remaining sugar, salt, margarine      and sour cream. Turn into a 11/2 -quart oiled casserole      dish, cover, and bake in 350° oven for 30 minutes or      until tender. Uncover and place under broiler to brown.      Serves 6.    </p>    <p>      Much of this cool- weather crop's success depends on      timing.    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>SUSAN SAYS</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS from MOTHER'S garden er, Susan      Sides: It's not really all that hard to locate the turnip      listings in any seed catalog. Let the book fall open to the      lavish tomato section, turn the page, and there they'll      be-all two or three varieties.    </p>    <p>      Now, the flea beetle and cabbage maggot populations think,      of course, that we've gotten our priorities all wrong.      These discerning diners will take a turnip over a "love      apple" any day. And if you're cultivating your own crop of      Purple Tops in the spring (when the little pests are most      active), they'll think you're so very kind to go through      all that trouble just for them.    </p>    <p>      To avoid the worst of the damage, you could plant only in      autumn. (Another plus for fall planting is that the      vegetables are not nearly as likely to develop a bitter,      woody taste as a result of maturing in warm weather.) But      some of us become addicted to those spring greens and      potlikker, and- lucky for us-there's more than      one way to skin a flea beetle.    </p>    <p>      One solution is to try sowing seeds three or four weeks      before the first fall frost date. Mulch the half-grown      plants just before frost does arrive to hold them over the      winter for an advanced spring start. (An additional layer      or two of spunbond row cover helps in the coldest regions.)      Another angle is to plant seeds as soon as the ground can      be worked in late winter. (Prepare this area ahead of time      in the fall.) Cover with a cloche or cold frame until the      nights slip above freezing. A third method for dedicated      turnip fans is to start seeds indoors in individual pots      eight weeks before the last spring frost date. Transplant      to the garden after plants have four or five weeks of      growth under their belts.    </p>    <p>      All three of these suggestions will help you mature an      extra-early crop. Then, while sleeping insects only dream      of turnips yet to come, you'll be harvesting them by the      armload.    </p>
