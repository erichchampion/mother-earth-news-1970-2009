                <p>      <strong>Barters & Bootstraps</strong>    </p>        <p>      Gary Crooker started a business      with just a few dollars and a love of literature. Here's      how    </p>    <p>      WHY USED BOOKS?<br /> "You can stock the titles you and your      customers love<br /> without being a slave to the best-seller      list."    </p>        <p>      Do you find yourself lingering just that few extra minutes      in book shops or libraries, with a faraway look in your      eyes, long after everyone else is ready to go? Do the      people you are with seem to have to drag you away after you      have promised to stay in your favorite book haunt just      "five minutes more?" Do you always seem to gravitate toward      the table of books at yard sales and flea markets?    </p>    <p>      If the answer to any or all of these questions is yes, then      maybe the business for you is the one I explored and fell      in love with two years ago: owning and operating your own      used bookstore.    </p>    <p>      Why a <em>used</em> bookstore? Because you can get into the      business relatively easily and stock the type of literature      that you and many of your customers love without being a      slave to current best-seller lists. And in the used-book      business you can get started without the large outlays of      cash that are usually associated with the beginning phases      of a retail operation. I did it on a startup loan of just      $3,000.    </p>    <p>      Now instead of feeling guilty about hanging around book      sales and stores, I can do it to my heart's content, secure      in the knowledge that I am not languishing but working. I'm      not sure that all of my friends and relatives are convinced      of it yet, but as my business shows its (albeit modest)      profits, they are beginning to see the wisdom of it all.    </p>    <p>      If you have a love of books and know the difference between      Thomas Wolfe, Tom Wolfe, and Virginia Woolf, then take a      minute and I'll tell you how simple it is to build a      business that you'll leap out of bed to come to.    </p>    <h3>      Planning and Stocking    </h3>        <p>      First of all you will have to accumulate a stock of books.      But before you go off buying every used book in sight, give      some thought to what it is you want to sell. If you make      your offering too broad or too narrow you will end up      satisfying no one.    </p>    <p>      Your particular passion may be for signed copies by 19th      century African-American authors who lived in Atlanta. That      may be an admirable interest, but you might have trouble      finding enough other people who share it to make for a      paying proposition.    </p>    <p>      If, on the other hand, you set out to find, and offer for      sale, every book on every subject conceivable, you will end      up with a warehouse instead of a store. And you will still      fall far short of your goal. There are just too many books      out there. What I opted to do was run a general shop      focusing on areas of interest that other dealers claim to      be the most popular. Alphabetized fiction, the Civil War,      crafts, Native Americans, cookbooks, and children's books      are all among my most popular sections. Rare titles in      these categories are, by definition, hard to come by, but      desirable, much sought after, and still out there by the      thousands if you know where the hidi ng places are.    </p>    <p>      Among the places I look for and discover books are yard      sales, library book sales, estate sales, auctions, and flea      markets. An added advantage of hanging out a shingle is      that many books will walk in the door. In other words,      people will come to you with books to sell, providing you a      cheap and time-efficient way of adding to your stock. If      this kind of shopping doesn't interest you, then stop right      here because this probably isn't the business for you.      Getting to the right sale first and leaving with an armful      of treasures is to me the greatest joy of the used-book      trade.    </p>        <p>      Although you will find others out there competing with you      for the books that you want, there will be days when      everything breaks just right. Once a couple of summers ago,      I turned up at a local private school where a day-long      fund-raiser was just beginning. In addition to an auction      and other events, there was a small table of books in the      back. The books were all sorted out into categories and      ready to sell but the gentleman in charge said the sale      wasn't to start for another half hour. I was happy enough      to be the first one there and asked if it would be all      right to look around. He not only told me to go ahead and      look around but that I may as well grab an empty box and      set aside anything that I was interested in. By the time      anyone else had shown up I had three boxes of cookbooks, a      set of Ulysses Grant memoirs and enough highly salable      novels and reference books to make my day.    </p>    <p>      I spent about $60 at that sale, but before I left the      parking lot, I had sold $150 worth of books to      late-arriving dealers. And those sales hardly made a dent      in the stock I had acquired! Of course, you will not always      be the first one at every sale and even when you are you      may not find the pickings as juicy. But believe me, if you      are persistent you will have enough of those experiences to      keep you coming back for more.    </p>        <p>      Once you have put together an inventory of books you will,      of course, have to find a location from which to offer your      wares to the public. If you are going the route of a      general shop, including several subject areas, then you      should probably have a minimum of about 2,000 books.    </p>    <p>      The first place to consider officially becoming a      bookseller may be right in your own home. If you are lucky      enough to be located in an area of your community where the      zoning allows a retail enterprise, this is your best option      in terms of cost.    </p>    <p>      For a beginning stock, one or two rooms in your house      should suffice. You will save on the overhead of paying      rent and at tax time can deduct a certain amount from your      household expenses toward a home business.    </p>    <p>      That choice wasn't available to me, but the cost of opening      a used bookstore, even if you have to pay rent, can still      be less expensive than you may think. Don't let the high      rents for small spaces charged in malls scare you off. The      people who like to spend leisurely afternoons browsing      through old books by and large aren't the same ones who      rush through big city malls. Your customers will be more      willing and likely to seek you out. I recently took on a      partner and have relocated the store in a refurbished mill      building in the town where I live. Sharing the rent and      expenses, we now have more money to spend acquiring books.      My partner's specialty areas (children's and scouting      books) and my own (fiction and history) complement each      other and provide a wider range of choice for our      customers.    </p>    <h3>      Store Layout    </h3>    <p>      We have low ceilings, exposed pipes and painted plywood      floors. We also have a monthly rental bill that is about      one-fifth of what we would pay for the same space in a more      "upscale" retail location.    </p>    <p>      All of this isn't to say that you shouldn't work to make      your store attractive. On the contrary, atmosphere is of      the utmost importance in a used bookstore. Bookstore      customers have fairly set fantasies about the type of      stores they want to spend their valuable browsing time in.      Wandering and searching until a title almost jumps off the      shelf and begs you to take it home is an experience that      accomplished browsers are familiar with. The surroundings      in which afternoon-long book hunts take place can make all      the difference in guaranteeing that your browsers return      again and again.    </p>    <p>      For example, the very first section that our patrons      encounter is the children's. We planned it that way because      it is a particularly strong and attractive area for us and      we want to make their all important first impression a      favorable one.    </p>    <p>      The children's books are allotted a large 20' x 20' space      in which both collectable books and lower-priced reading      copies are available. The 50 cents to $5 books are placed      on the lower shelves well within reach of the little hands      that are eager to get at them. Higher-priced collector      items can be secured on the upper shelves or on display      stands where interested adults can handle them safely.    </p>    <p>      But the children's section also serves another purpose. In      addition to being a receptacle for books and the welcome      mat to our store it is also an entertainment area for our      younger visitors. A chalk board, games, and toys are      provided along with an overstuffed chair and a tiny rocker.      Considering that children generally tire of the shopping      experience long before adults do, a little comfortable      furniture and fun diversions can go a long way toward      keeping customers around.    </p>    <p>      The adult visitors to your store will be looking for a      particular ambiance too and a few well-chosen yard-sale      purchases can help provide it. A braided rug here and      there, strategically placed reading chairs, and      refreshments can all add to the experience of visiting a      used bookstore. And it can't be stressed too many times      that an experience is what you are providing.    </p>    <p>      My store is furnished to encourage customers to spend as      long as they want looking through the books. We have some      very good customers who will spend the better part of an      afternoon in the store and leave without making a purchase.      But the seed has been planted. Those same people will blow      in a week later, go directly to the shelves they had been      browsing, and within fifteen minutes be back at the      checkout with $20-$50 worth of books.    </p>    <p>      Yard sales and auctions are also a great source for the      bookshelves that you will need to display your volumes.      When we first went into our new location we had many old      wooden tables that were already there and available for our      use. While they were not ideal for our purposes, they have      served us well as we gradually replaced them with      home-built shelving.    </p>    <p>      Coffee, tea, and doughnuts are always available as a      courtesy and if people come in and leave with nothing but a      full stomach and a warm feeling, that's fine with us. I      know they will be back. The cost of that type of      hospitality is far outweighed by the customer satisfaction,      word of mouth, and loyalty that it produces.    </p>    <h3>      Getting the Word Out    </h3>        <p>      One problem you will share with other retailers is how to      connect your product with your customers. Most people,      unless coaxed, will buy just what they perceive to be the      necessities of life. Now you and I know that books should      be included in that category, but the general public may      need some coaxing.    </p>    <p>      Often, the most effective method of coaxing or advertising      for a used bookstore can be very simple and inexpensive.      Simply write to the book-loving acquaintances that you      know. Let them know what your specialties are and whenever      you have a sale. If opening a store interests you, then you      have probably spent quite a bit of your life around others      who love them as you do.    </p>    <p>      We run specials every month on a display table celebrating      not only a major theme (African-American history, women's      rights, American presidents, World War II) but also the      birthdays of that month's literary lights. Books are set      out attractively on the table at a 10% discount of what may      in February may include works about and by Kennedy,      Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt. The other half of the      display will include books of such birthday celebrants as      John Steinbeck, Charles Darwin, and Edna St. Vincent      Millay.    </p>    <p>      There are many variations on this type of promotion and you      should make sure that all the bookworms and other dealers      in the area are aware of them. We also send a list, of what      our general stock includes and of any specials to the      public and school libraries within a 50-mile radius. With      school and municipal budgets being stretched to the      breaking point, you can offer a way to fill holes in their      collections at reduced prices and boost your sales at the      same time.    </p>    <h3>      The Bottom Line    </h3>        <p>      What about pricing? This is an area that scares away many      beginning booksellers because they just don't feel they      have the expertise to price their stock off the top of      their heads. There are no suggested retail prices to go by.      There are, however, very useful price guides that you      should invest in and use. <em>Mandevilles Used Book Price      Guide</em> is updated every five years with a new version      due out in late 1994. Another good price guide that also      offers a little more specific information on books is      <em>Collected Books (G. P</em> Putnam's Sons, 1991), by      Allen and Patricia Ahearn.    </p>    <p>      Also don't be afraid to check with other dealers or      collectors in your area to increase your knowledge of      pricing. There are shady characters in the used book      business as in every other, but for the most part you will      find they are straight-shooting lovers of the printed word      like yourself. By staying in touch with them and letting      them know about some of your new purchases, you will gain      valuable information ...and occasionally make a sale.    </p>    <p>      Above all don't be intimidated by the pricing process. As      long as you are buying your books at a reasonable rate, an      occasional mistake in pricing isn't going to put you out of      business. A lot more money is lost, and made, on used books      when you are buying than when you are selling.    </p>    <p>      Right after I opened my store I put a book on      African-American history on my shelves and priced it at      $35. I sold it within days to another dealer and it so      happened that I was able to track its route after it left      my shop. It ended up in the hands of a collector who was      waiting for it ,at the nifty price of $125.    </p>    <p>      Did I lose any sleep over my obvious underpricing? Not      really, because I gained twice in the transaction. First I      made a $34 profit because I had happened on the book at a      yard sale. Second, and in the long run much more important,      I learned the importance of keeping a list of my customers'      wants. Now when such a book comes into my possession the      first thing I do is check that always growing list and      connect the book with a willing buyer before it ever      reaches my shelves.    </p>    <p>      Finally, be sure that your customers are getting educated      along with yourself as you continue in the business. Being      bargain hunters, as most of your customers will be, they      may have to be enlightened to the importance of the      services that you are providing. I had a first-time visitor      to my shop last summer who arrived knowing exactly the book      he was looking for. Armed with the title and the author, I      was able to go directly to the fiction section and have the      book in front of him within a minute. He was delighted to      see the book, but much to my surprise balked at purchase      when he discovered that the price was $5.    </p>    <p>      "Well there is just no way I can justify paying that much      for a used book," he said. "I'm sure, I can find it at a      yard sale for about 50 cents."    </p>    <p>      All of my efforts to patiently and politely explain to him      the amount of time and money that goes into seeking out,      pricing, cataloging, and shelving each book fell on deaf      ears. Out the door he went and back to its slot went my      fairly common, but out-of-print novel. But not for long.      Within a week my reluctant buyer was back, admitting he'd      had no luck in his independent search. He decided that he      was interested in buying my copy after all. Alas, it had      already been sold, but I told my newly educated friend that      I would be glad to put his name and the book on my want      list. I assured him he would get a call the next time a      copy shown up.    </p>    <p>      As luck would have it, that turned out to be within the      next few days. I called the customer, he came in for the      book and willingly parted with $5 he had felt was so      exorbitant just days before.    </p>    <p>      With a new appreciation of the usedbook business, he is now      a weekly visitor and regular buyer at my store. Sometimes      he just comes in for coffee and a homemade doughnut and      sometimes he leaves with a bag of books. But he is      definitely hooked on the idea of visiting regularly and      seeing what new treasures have showed up on my shelves.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, he seems to stay a little longer each      time and the frequency of his visits continues to increase.      I think I may have even noticed that faraway look in his      eye that tells me the legion of used booksellers may soon      be gaining a new member.    </p>        <p>      I f you decide that starting your book business at home is      the best route, you will have to begin by deciding what      type of I selling you are going to do.    </p>    <p>      If you plan to build a customer list and sell mostly      through the mail, you will probably find it a fairly easy      route as far as your town or city officials are concerned.      Even if you are in an area zoned as residential, you should      be able to get an exception for a home business without      much difficulty.    </p>    <p>      If, on the other hand, you are leaning to ward an open shop      you may find the road a little tougher. The place to start      is at your city or town hall where you will be referred to      the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Be aware that the main      concern of these boards will be the impact of such a      business on the rest of the neighborhood. Issues such as      additional traffic and lighting will be addressed and all      of your abutting neighbors will be advised of the hearing      date.    </p>    <p>      It's always a good idea to be on friendly terms with your      neighbors, and never more so than when seeking an exception      to your local ordinance. They will all be allowed to speak      to the issue at your hearing. Even if your neighbors are in      favor of the idea, a favorable ruling is not assured, but      if several are openly opposed, the board will be      substantially more inclined to rule against you. Take a few      moments to let your neighbors know in advance, sound them      out, and discuss the plan in as much detail as they want.      Some thoughtful (and early) public relations efforts can      make all the difference.    </p>
