                <p>      <strong>Summer Projects</strong>    </p>        <p>      A dependable wood      bench and shelves that can be built in a couple of hours.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Tom Moates    </h5>        <p>      Here are two quick-to build woodworking projects that will      come in especially hand, this time of year. The portable      workbench is great to use as a toot holder and seat for      easy, no-kneel, low-level gardening such as weeding or      harvesting bush beans. And the canning shelves will hold      sparkling jars of your garden's bounty.    </p>    <h3>      A PORTABLE WORKBENCH    </h3>    <p>      Whether you are a contractor who builds everyday or a      banker who fixes around the house on weekends, the      portable, easy-to-build tool bench will allow you to tote      everything you need for a task, while providing a perfect      seat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Material</strong>    </p>    <p>      A light, durable wood like pine or poplar should be used      for constructing the bench. You may already have scrap from      another project suitable for this one, but if you don't,      you will have to purchase only two boards-one 1" x 6"      x 14' board and one 1" x 4" x 6' board; 1 1/4" drywall      screws are ideal for holding the bench together; a      half-pound will be adequate for the job. Any building      supply will be able to furnish you these materials.    </p>    <p>      If you are not familiar with buying lumber there is a fact      you need to know. Planed (dressed) lumber will be slightly      smaller than the measurements it is listed as and unplaned      (rough) lumber will run slightly larger. For instance, a 1"      x 6" dressed board will actually measure about Y" x 5Y4".      For this project, that slight difference will not matter.      Simply follow the directions provided here and the tool      bench will turn out correctly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cutting</strong>    </p>    <p>      On the 1" x 6" x 14' board, using a square, mark two 24"      lengths, two 22" lengths, and four 18" lengths. On the 1" x      4" x 6' board, mark two 24" lengths and two 12" lengths.      Cut out these lengths.    </p>    <p>      One corner of each 1" x 6" x 18" board needs to be cut off      at a diagonal to create the legs for the bottom of the      bench. Choose a corner, measure along one edge 4", make a      mark, and then measure 4" from that same corner along the      other edge and make a mark. Use a straight edge to draw a      line connecting these two marks and then cut along this      line, removing the corner from the board.    </p>    <p>      The top of the bench will have a hole cut into it as a      carrying handle. Along one side of each of the two 1" x 6"      x 24"s make a mark in the center. Measure and mark 2 1/2"      on either side of the middle mark on the edge of the      boards. Then measure in 1" from the edge at the high and      low marks and make marks. Ignore the first center mark and      use a straightedge to connect the other four marks on each      board, making a 1" x 5" rectangle. Cut out these rectangles      with a jigsaw or by making multiple 1"-deep saw cuts within      the rectangles and knocking out the small chunks. When put      together on top of the bench they will make a 2" x 5"      handle. Finally, take the two 1" x 4" x 12"s and rip each      board in half, making four 1" x 2" x 12" strips.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Assembly</strong>    </p>    <p>      On a flat surface, lay two of the 1" x 2" x 12" strips you      have just ripped. Across these strips lay two of the 1" x      6" x 18" boards with their cutoff corners facing each      other. Align one strip along the top edge of both pieces      and screw it securely there, using two screws per board.      The quickest way to screw the pieces together is using a      Phillips-head screwdriver bit in a variable-speed drill.      Next, position the bottom strip 4 1/4" up from the bottom      and screw it into place. Repeat this procedure with the      other two 1" x 2" x 12" strips and 1" x 6" x 18" end      boards.    </p>    <p>      Next take the two 1" x 6" x 22" boards, place them flush      against the end boards on top of the strips you just      mounted, and screw them from the top side down into the      strips.    </p>    <p>      Place the 1" x 6" x 24" boards on top of the bench, align      them flush with the end boards, and screw them into place.      Be sure to put the precut handle notches together in the      center of the top.    </p>    <p>      Finally, position the two 1" x 4" x 24" boards along the      sides, even with the bottom of the 1" x 6" x 22" boards,      completing the tool tray, and screw them into place (two      screws at each end and three spaced along the bottom).    </p>    <p>      Your tool bench is complete! Gather the tools you need for      a particular job in the tray, tote the stool to the site,      and you can sit on it and work, stand on it to reach higher      places, or use the bench to saw or chisel on.    </p>    <h3>      SHOW OFF YOUR COLORFUL CANNED GOODS    </h3>    <p>      If you take pride in canning summer produce, then this      easy-to-build, inexpensive set of shelves may be just right      for you. It is similar to a self-standing book shelf and      provides a large amount of storage while allowing the      colorful harvest goods to be shown off. And it makes      keeping inventory a snap.    </p>    <p>      The only tools necessary for completing this project are a      circular saw, a carpenter's square, a tape measure, a chalk      line, a hammer, and a pencil. The materials list is equally      straightforward: seven 1" x 6" x 8' boards and 1/2-pound of      12d nails.    </p>    <p>      I approached this project as a rustic country pantry shelf,      so I purchased roughcut pine lumber. If you prefer a more      refined looking shelf then you may purchase dressed lumber      from your local building supply. Pine or poplar should be      available just about anywhere and are very good woods for      this project, being light, durable, and very easy to work      with. Also, you may go as far as sanding and finishing your      shelves, but I just kept mine simple and rustic.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Layout and Cutting</strong>    </p>    <p>      Choose two 8' boards for the side pieces. Take one of these      boards and, using the carpenter's square, see whether it      has a square (90°) end. If neither end is square, then      come down approximately 2" from an end, draw a 90° line      using the square, and cut along this line making a square      end. Pull your tape measure from this end and make a small      mark at 5' 11". Take the carpenter's square and draw a      90° line right at the mark you just made. Cut along the      line. You should now have one 1" x 6" x 5' 11" board with      two square ends. Repeat this process on the other board you      chose for a side board so that you have two 1" x 6" x 5'      11" square-ended boards.    </p>    <p>      The next step is basically the same as above, only the cut      boards are smaller for shelf use. Choose four 1" x 6" x 8'      boards from the remaining pile. Pick a board and try to      find a square end. If neither end is square, repeat the      above process for marking and cutting a square end. Pull      your tape measure from the square end and make a mark at      3'9". Draw the 90° line and cut along that line. Now      pull your tape measure from the end you just cut on the      remaining piece, make a mark at 3' 9", draw a 90° line,      and cut along that line. You should end up with two 1" x 6"      x 3' 9" shelf boards with square ends and a little      kindling. Repeat this process for the remaining three shelf      boards you chose so there are a total of seven 1" x 6" x 3'      9" shelf boards with square ends.    </p>    <p>      Take the length of board (approximately 4' 3") remaining      from the last shelf you cut and mark a 45° line as      close as possible to one end. Measure 14" along the edge of      the board from the point where the line is closest to the      end of the board and make a small mark. Draw a 45° line      back toward the other line so that 14" is the wide edge and      the lines taper to about 3". Cut along these lines. Repeat      this process once again. These are two uppercorner brackets      that both give the shelves stability and provide a place to      nail the unit to a wall.    </p>    <p>      Finally, you will need to knock out some simple safety      strips that will keep the jars from falling out the front      of the shelves in the event they are jostled. The remaining      board will be ripped into four 1 1/2" strips. At each end      of the board make marks at 1 1/2", 3", and 4 1/2". Stretch      the chalk line taut between corresponding marks and then      snap lines. If you are working alone, a nail temporarily      driven at one end of the board on a mark will provide you      the extra hand needed to hold one end of the string. Rip      along these lines with a circular saw so that you end up      with four 1"x 1 1/2" x 8' strips. Choose a strip and check      for a square end; make a square end as shown above if there      isn't one. Pull your tape measure from the square end and      mark at 3' 11". Make a square line and cut along that line.      Pull the tape measure from the cut just made along the      remaining piece, mark at 3' 11 ", draw a line, and cut.      Repeat this for the remaining four strips until you have a      total of six 1" x 1 1/2" x 3' 11" strips. You now have cut      all the pieces necessary to build the shelves.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Assembly</strong>    </p>    <p>      Assembly begins by nailing the four pieces together that      create the outer rectangular shape of the shelves. Have      your hammer and nails ready. On the floor, stand up on edge      the top piece (a 1" x 6" x 3'9") and a side piece (a 1" x      6" x 5' 11"). Bring the top piece along flush to the top of      the side piece so that the end grain of the side piece      remains exposed and that of the shelf piece cannot be seen.      Nail through the side piece into the top piece using three      nails (front, middle, and back). Repeat this procedure with      the other side piece and a bottom (another 1" x 6" x 3'      9"). Bring the two pieces together so they make a      rectangle-be sure to align them so that the end grain      of the longer side pieces remains exposed and that of the      shelf pieces is covered by the sides-and nail using      three nails per connection as described. Use the      carpenter's square at each corner of the rectangle to make      sure they are square. If the rectangle is not square,      gently move the unit until it becomes square and then      proceed.    </p>    <p>      Measure down from the bottom of the top shelf along one      side and make a small mark at 11 3/4". Repeat this along      the other side. Use the square and a pencil to make a      90° line through these marks by putting the long edge      of the square along the floor next to the side board (make      sure the floor is level and the square really is aligning      with the surface of the side board.) Fit a shelf board into      the rectangle so that its top surface runs exactly between      the two lines you have just drawn. Nail the shelf in place.      Measure down 10 3/4" from the bottom of the newly installed      shelf and repeat the above procedure. It will be 10 3/4"      from the bottom of one shelf to the top of the next shelf.    </p>    <p>      Finally, install the safety strips. Measure up 2 1/2" from      the top of each shelf along both sides and make small      marks. Align the bottoms of the strips between the marks      and nail them there using only two nails per strip, one      nail per side.    </p>    <p>      Flip the whole unit over so the safety strips are down.      Take one of the two remaining braces and position it in a      top corner so that its 45° edges align with the top and      side of the shelf unit. Nail it in place with two nails at      each end. Repeat this procedure with the other brace on the      other top corner.    </p>    <p>      Take the bookshelflike unit and stand it against a wall      (with the safety strips facing the room, of course). It      will need to be fastened to the wall because, even if the      shelving unit is full, the weight of the jars will make      them top heavy and prone to falling over. I used one nail      through each bracket into the wall. If your wall is      Sheetrock you will have to either nail through the braces      into studs, or find one of many Sheetrock-fastening gizmos      available at most hardware stores.    </p>    <p>      Your canning-jar shelves are complete and ready to fill. It      will hold 60 half-gallon mason jars or 90 quarts and you      can pile your cookbooks on top between bookends. For      simplicity, low cost, efficient use of space, safe storage      of jars, and easy food inventory, the mason-jar shelves are      a great addition to any pantry.    </p>
