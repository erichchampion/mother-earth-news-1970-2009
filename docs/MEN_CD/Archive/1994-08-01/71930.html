                <p>      <strong>Summer Projects</strong>    </p>        <p>      Backyard Adventures Building a sandpit, water table, and      simple toys can provide years of adventure... and a little      peace and quiet around the house.    </p>        <p>      The swamp maples are showing a hint of fall color, but      summer is still very much with us, and the outdoors is      warm, spring-bug free, and perfect for outdoor play. But      over the bleating of the TV in the family room comes a      petulant "Mommeeeee, whaaaaat can I doooooo?"-a sure      sign that school vacation is winding down. If the kids are      small, you find yourself barking, "Time Out!" more often      than you like. If you've a preteen, anything but a day of      mall-crawling is "Borrr-ing!" Everyone in the family is      anxious for school to start-children too, even if      they won't admit it-but there are still weeks of      freedom for them to endure ...for you all to endure.    </p>    <p>      What say you off "Barney" or "Hollywood 9-0-whatever-0,"      herd the kids outside, and all of you get to work building      a sand pit (or sandbox) big enough for serious excavating      and a waterplay table shallow enough to be safe for      toddlers but guaranteed to keep all ages intrigued, wet,      and cool through the dog days. Plus an assortment of      sand-building blocks and simple wheeled toys that are easy      to make and plenty sturdy but no great loss if left out in      the rain or under snow all winter. Together, they offer      much of the fun of a trip to the shore.    </p>    <p>      An adult must do all the power-tool work, of course; but      let the kids help dig the sand pit, measure and hand-saw      wood, hammer, and paint. Give kids a series of small jobs      they can complete success fully ...even if it does take      twice as long-or perhaps <em>because</em> it does.      Make the projects family fun rather than work. It's still      vacation, remember?    </p>        <h3>      OUR SAND PIT			     </h3>    <p>      The best-used outdoor "toy" I ever made for our kids and      their little pals was the sand pit-about a cubic yard      (29 cubic feet or 50 buckets) of sand dumped into a 1 1/2'      deep, 3' x 4' oblong hole dug in the lawn of the side yard.      Singly or two to four at a time, the children would spend      hours there, building roads and caverns and hideouts.      Without much squabbling either; sand play is physically      active but focused. There were plenty of Tonkas and      homemade sand scrapers, scoopers, haulers, and building      blocks to go around. Plus, this was when <em>Star Wars</em>      first came out, and model Sand People were right at home      stalking R2D2 and 3CPO through the minidunes.    </p>    <p>      Now that the children are college age, the pit has gone      back to lawn and you'd never know it existed. But under the      sod, between the quince bush and big apple tree, is a wedge      of well-broken-in sand waiting to be uncovered and topped      up for grandchildren, if and when. They'll find a small      fortune in lost <em>Star Wars</em> figurines buried there      if they dig deep enough.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Size and Shape</strong>    </p>    <p>      To determine the size pit you need, wait till your kids get      down on their hands and knees-head-to-head, playing      together with little cars, model animals, or small dolls.      You'll see that two children establish a more or less      target-shaped play space: a one-to-three-foot-diameter      joint-play circle inside a larger maneuvering circle from      four to five feet in diameter. Three children need perhaps      six inches more in circle diameter, and four a bit more      still. Surrounding the active play space is a ring of floor      space where they will keep toys not in active use.    </p>    <p>      Our sandpit was built when Sam and Martha were two and four      years old and requiring constant supervision, so it had to      be placed in eye-shot of the kitchen and sun room windows.      The best location on our place was in the lawn, just a few      steps from the kitchen porch and shaded at midday by a      spreading apple tree-an important consideration now      that we know how full sun can do serious damage to fair      skin.    </p>    <p>      When the excavation was a foot deep, I encountered a huge      apple-tree root that was too big to be grubbed out easily      and large enough that I felt the tree needed it more than      we need a perfectly round sandpit. So I ended up digging      out a kind of peanut shape, a little less than a yard wide      and some five feet long. As I watched the kids play in it      over the years, I decided that the tree root had put me      onto the ideal sandpit shape. The curved oval offered      adequately separated independent-play spaces at each end,      joint play space in the middle, and a racetrack all around.    </p>    <p>      Once site, size, and shape are decided, you need to dig the      pit, assuring that it will hold shape and drain quickly.      Cut out sod in easily moved chunks. You can plug good sod      into bare spots in the lawn, or stack it upside-down to      molder into the compost. Do not just dump the sod in a      split-donut-shaped rim around the pit thinking it will      reduce the digging needed, and help keep sand in. I      followed that reasoning and can attest that it is      impossible to mow the grass on the round hump without      scalping the top and stalling the mower. If you do want to      rim the pit with sod, pack a sloping fillet of thin sod      chunks or top soil around the outer edge to form a gently      sloping volcano shape that can be mowed easily.    </p>    <p>      Dig out the dark-colored top soil and add to compost or      scatter in the garden. If it is as good as was the loamy      soil under our apple tree, screen out rocks and mix with      compost for potting soil. When you get to light-colored      subsoil, you may need a square-ended cutting spade or even      a mattock or pick to remove it ...but do dig till you get      down 18 inches, and two feet is better to let the kids dig      really satisfying pits and tunnels.    </p>    <p>      If your subsoil is hardpan or clay, the pit may not drain      well, and stagnant water can make the sand smell like a      swamp. If the sand pit is on a slope, dig a narrow trench      out from the pit bottom in a slight down angle till it      exits the brow of the hill. Put in perforated drainage pipe      or drain tile or fill with crushed rock or coarse gravel,      cover with a layer of plastic sheeting, and replace soil      and sod. Or, in the center of the pit, use a posthole      digger to grub out a dry well a foot across and as deep as      you can reach, and fill with rubble, stones, or crushed      rock.    </p>    <p>      Rim the pit cleanly by digging an undercut around the      rim-scraping about six inches of soil out from under      the sod all around. Especially if soil is wet, loose, or      sandy, set corrugated metal or plastic lawn edging in under      the sod all around the cut to keep the edge from subsiding,      and letting topsoil intrude into the sand wedge. The edging      will also bar soil critters from moving in and will slow      the inevitable mingling of soil with sand. Don't run the      edging up to ground level, as the sharp edge could cut a      child; push the ring of sod jutting beyond the undercut      down over the edging to form a rounded lip at the pit's      edge. The mower won't reach down, but the kids will keep      grass around the lip worn down.    </p>    <h3>      A SANDBOX    </h3>    <p>      If you do not want to dig up your lawn, boxing the sand      above ground is fine, although the grass under it will be      killed unless you make the considerable effort to move box      and contents every few days.    </p>    <p>      You can make a simple but serviceable wooden sandbox from a      sheet of 1/2" thick plywood for the box and a cheaper 1/4      sheet for a base. Cut one 4' x 8' sheet into three 16" x 8'      strips (see illustration above). Bisect one strip into a      pair of 4' lengths. Form the four panels into a 4' x 8' x      16"-high rectangular open-topped box (make it shorter if      you wish by trimming the long panels equally).    </p>    <p>      Fasten 2" long wood-lath stakes at ends and every two feet      along the outsides of plywood panels, and hammer stake ends      into the soil to hold the panels down. Fasten the      galvanized-steel right-angle truss plates you bought from      the hardware store inside each corner-running      self-tapping drywall screws through holes in plates      ...through ply panels ...and into end stakes.    </p>    <p>      Make triangular corner seats with scrap wood cleats      fastened underneath to fit the edges of the plywood sides.      Glue and nail the seats to the ply and corner stakes, and      sand the seat-the edge facing into the box      especially. Finish seat and box with paint or outdoor      varnish to bind in any potential splinters.    </p>    <p>      As an additional antisplinter measure, around the upper      edge of all four sides, fasten wood molding or plastic      bumper material from a boating-supply store (or collect      three or four old bicycle tires; cut in half, snip      sidewalls every few inches and staple around ply). You can      install the sides around a second sheet of ply (with an      inch trimmed off one end and one side) laid on the ground      if you want to be able to shovel out the sand easily. There      is little point of fastening bottom to sides.    </p>    <p>      Be sure you use outdoor-glued plywood that is smooth and      splinter free, "finished-one-side" for the upper surface of      the bottom sheet and inner surface of the sides-where      kids will scoot around and might get splinters. Before      beginning construction it is best to seal both side surface      of plywood with a clear, weatherproofing finish to bind in      splinters and retard decay.    </p>    <h3>      A WOOD-BEAM SAND CRIB    </h3>    <p>      I've built plenty of plywood boxes, however never to hold      sand. The one time I did build soil bins above ground was      to contain compost mixed with glass cullet made by crushing      old bottles (this was in 1969-just before the first      Earth Day when municipal recycling began to catch on). I      used it to grow lovely, straight carrots, but the design      would make a sturdy, quick, and easily      disassembled/recycled sandbox.    </p>    <p>      The carrot crib was made of stacked 8"-square, 8'-long      fence posts sawed from native Northern white      cedar-which (along with redwood and red cedar in the      West, Osage orange in the Midwest, and others) just      naturally resists the terrors of bugs and rot. Cheaper is      pressure-treated lumber used in ground-contact      construction. However, the pressure-treatment contains      copper and arsenic, two metallic poisons that I didn't want      near the carrots and you surely won't want holding in your      kid's sand pile.    </p>    <p>      I notched the ends log-cabin-like with the chain saw      and stacked the posts three high on a flat and level area      of sod. Their weight held them in place, but they were      warped enough to wobble, so for good measure, I drilled      3/8" holes down through the corner joints and dropped in 6"      spikes as lock pins.    </p>    <p>      To get sand, I recruited an assortment of kids and made      them sit quietly in the pickup truck bed while we drove to      a natural gravel and sand bank. After the kids chose the      best sand in the hill, we all started shoveling it into      buckets and dumping it in the truck. We picked out roots      and clumps of sod and rocks large enough to do damage in      small hands. Back home after a stop at the swimming hole,      we dumped the larger rocks into the dry well I'd sunk in      the center of the pit, then shoveled in the sand. It took      three loads-wet sand and a half-dozen wet, bouncy      kids being heavy enough that a third-of-a-yard (9 cubic      feet) made the truck's rear springs complain a little.    </p>    <p>      If you don't have a truck, but live near a natural sand      deposit, you can haul it buckets at a time in the trunk of      a car. You may be able to get road sand from your town's      landfill or highway department. Or, you can order it hauled      in a dump truck from any aggregate or traprock supplier to      the building trades. Clean "sharp" sand will be stone and      dirt free. Or as a last resort, intown pool and outdoor      furniture retailers sell white beach sand in bags for city      kids who need sandboxes as much or more than country kids.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cats</strong>    </p>    <p>      The neighborhood cats may try to adopt a sand pile as a      giant kitty-litter box. Don't let it start. Besides being      anaesthetic in the extreme, cat feces may contain human      pathogens and parasites and you surely don't want the kids      playing anywhere near it. Our dogs woofed cats out of the      yard during the day and the kid's green-eyed, orange      she-cat chased them away at night-and, once she'd      joined the kids playing in the sand a couple of times, she      seemed to prefer the loose soil of our garden to the sand      pit. But, I kept a constant check on cat activity. On the      way in from the garden every evening, I'd smooth the sand      with the garden rake. If I'd ever seen signs of a digging      or romping cat, I'd have raked and hosed the sand clean and      put on a cover.    </p>    <p>      The best sand cover I know is one of those inexpensive      blue, woven vinyl tarps you can get for a few dollars at      any hardware store. Leave one over the sand anytime it's      not in use, holding it in place with stones all around or      wood planks on top. The kids will be able to remove it and      (if you nag them long enough) replace it. If rain water      pools on top, burn a few small holes through the middle      with a small flame or soldering iron. (The heat will seal      the edges so the hole margin won't ravel and enlarge with      use.)    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      AN OUTDOOR WATER TABLE    </h2>    <p>      If you've visited a kindergarten recently, you've seen the      children playing in an indoor water table: a sturdy      worktable with a low rim around the perimeter to hold a      very shallow pool of water. At an indoor table, children      must be disciplined to create quiet little water worlds.      Outdoors, play will be more rambunctious, so water can be a      little deeper and bathing suits are the garment of choice.      We always provided a supply of little disposable      bathroom-size paper cups for pouring-otherwise, a      succession of cooking measures, coffee mugs, and dangerous      glass drinking vessels found their way out to the table.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Size and Depth</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most school water tables are built to be kid-waist high,      but for a backyard version you needn't build a piece of      furniture with a rigid frame and legs. Build it on flat      ground and block it to be perfectly level so the kids can      play in it much as they play in the sandbox, and you'll      save time, trouble and weight (filled with sand or gravel,      rocks, and water, it will be heavy enough.)    </p>    <p>      Like the sand pit, the table should be long enough to      present an independent play area at each end but be narrow      enough that children ranged along opposing sides can reach      in and play together. Again, observe a pair of kids playing      dolls or cars on the rug and measure the distance from the      belt of one to the other. I've found that a 2' x 4' table      is fine for small kids, 2 1/2 x 6' good for older ones. Do      not be tempted to make it so big the children are tempted      to climb in, splash around, and bust it up.    </p>    <p>      If small kids have (even forbidden) access to a hose, they      will eventually fill the water table to brimming. And      despite being told not to, they will eventually go wading      in it. A small child could conceivably slip, fall ...and a      toddler can drown in even an inch of water. Unless you will      have an adult in constant attendance, don't give them the      chance to come to grief. If your youngest is under age 3,      build a table with a low rim or drill drain holes all      around so water can never get more than an inch deep. If      the youngest is over age 6, water can be up to 4" deep.      However, the table isn't meant to be a pool, but a      miniworld with shallow, playoceans and rivers. I think that      a box with 3" sides containing an inch or so of gravel and      drain-hole drilled to give a maximum standing-water depth      of 2" is best. The kids can have fun and you needn't worry.      You can block up one end a couple of inches to give a      shallow and deep end and enough slope to make little rivers      through the gravel or sand when the hose is left on in a      trickle. Kids can use wood blocks to dam the stream in      3"-deep pools to give a most satisfying, little waterfall.    </p>    <h3>      BUILD A 2 1/2'-WIDE x 5'-LONG x 4"-DEEP WATER      TABLE    </h3>    <p>      You will need:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tools</strong>    </p>    <p>      Electric circular saw with plywood-cutting blade; Electric      drill/screw driver with Phillips-head drive bit and 1/16"      drill bit; Long, measuring steel and pencil, or chalk and      string snap line; Hammer and nail set; Caulking gun with 1      tube of outdoor-grade construction cement for wood, and 1      tube of (waterproof) adhesive, clear acrylic caulk; Sanding      block or electric sander and sandpaper; Staple gun and 3/8"      stainless steel staples (for sheet-good waterproofing).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Materials</strong>    </p>    <p>      One 4' x 8' sheet of 1/2"-thick outdoor-glued plywood      (smooth-one-side); Four 2' x 3' x 8' clear fir or spruce      wall studs (straight in all dimensions); Fifty 1 1/2" long,      #8 stainless-steel Phillips-head drywall screws; Twenty 1"      long, #8 stainless-steel Phillips-head drywall screws;      Twenty 3" galvanized finish nails; Twenty 1" galvanized      finish nails; Paint or clear finish; 20' marine rubber      bumper stock (or 4 or 5 old bicycle tires).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Construction</strong>    </p>    <p>      General assembly notes:    </p>    <p>      a. With 1/16 <em>"</em> drill bit, drill pilot holes      through plywood to start all nail and screw holes. b. Apply      a bead of construction cement in all wood joints.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Steps:</strong>    </p>    <p>      1. Cut ply into:    </p>    <p>      One 5' 4" x 2' 6" wide bottom panel; Two 5' 4" x 6" wide      side panels; Two 2', 6" x 6" wide end panels; Eight 6"      triangles for corner gussets.    </p>    <p>      2. Cut framing from 2" x 3" studs, the sides first.    </p>    <p>      Lay the bottom panel on the ground and cut two lengths of      2" x 3" to be as long as it is. These will be the sides of      the frame.    </p>    <p>      3. Fasten side-frame boards to the plywood bottom panel.    </p>    <p>      With smooth, finished face of the bottom ply facing up, set      a 2" x 3" frame side board under each long edge, the 2" x      3"s "on edge"-with wider 3" surface facing out. Be      sure outer edges of frame boards are even with edges of the      bottom sheet. Fasten with screws 6" from end and placed      every 6' ; screws will be through ply and down into the 2"      x 3"s.    </p>    <p>      4. Cut frame ends and cross braces to fit bottom panel.      Turn bottom panel over. Measure and cut 2" x 3"s to fit      between ends of the frame boards just screwed on. Measure      and cut 5 other lengths of 2 x 3 to form a ladder shape of      cross braces between frame sides.    </p>    <p>      5. Tack fasten ends and braces. Arrange frame ends and      cross braces in a ladder shape on underside of bottom      panel. Cement and tack in place with long, easily removed      nails through 2" x 3"s and into ply.    </p>    <p>      6. Reinforce underside of corners. Cut four triangular      braces from scrap ply and place one at each corner. Use      cement and short finish nails to fasten.    </p>    <p>      7. Carefully turn ply over again. Set screws through bottom      panel and down to the frame members, screws about every 6".      Now the bottom is framed.    </p>    <p>      8. Next, "box in" framed bottom with plywood side and end      panels. Lay out the 5' 4" plywood side panels along the      framed bottom, lower edge of side panels even with bottom      edge of frame.    </p>    <p>      9. Lay out the plywood end panels. Arrange and (as needed)      trim ends of sides and ends so all corners meet in a butt      joint (end of one meets side edge of the other). Fasten      sides and ends to frame with screws 6" apart, 1/2" up from      lower edge. Remove tack nails from underside.    </p>    <p>      10. Cut and install corner cleats to strengthen up side of      corners. Trim about a foot of scrap 2" x 3" to be a 1/2"      square. Measuring in the box, cut four approx. 3"      cleats-one to fit into each corner, upper end even      with the rim. Drill stag gered holes 3" in from corners and      fasten cleats with glue and 1" screws through ply into      cleats.    </p>    <p>      11. Caulk and water seal the box. See below.    </p>    <p>      12. Install triangular top corner braces: Apply glue to      bottom of remaining four plywood triangles and tack one at      each corner of box, edges even with outside of box. Use      small nails through triangle and into edges of plywood side      and side panels and a long nail down into corner cleat.      Countersink nails well into ply. Sand edges. Caulk all      joints inside and out and water seal the plywood.    </p>       <p>      <strong>Waterproofing</strong>    </p>    <p>      The table needn't be completely waterproof, but it makes      for a better job, dryer kids, and less water waste if it      is. Here are three options:    </p>    <p>      A good bead of sticky, clear acrylic caulk along insides of      all seams will seal a well-fastened water table if wood      surfaces to be caulked are dry and dust free. But, under      repeated soakings, the caulk will work loose and plywood      will deteriorate unless covered with a waterproof finish.      Better is to caulk and then paint with clear outdoor      varnish or several applications of sky blue, glossy,      latex-enamel paint intended for house trim.    </p>    <p>      Better yet is the old way of sealing canoes and covering      aircraft. Get ahold of enough lightweight canvas, blue      denim, or any open weave, hard-finished fabric to cover the      sides and bottom, plus a gallon or two of marine (canoe)      paint or airplane dope. Sky blue is the best color. Cut      fabric into panels to fit bottom and all sides with a good      inch of overlap at seams and over the top of side and end      panels. Along bound edges of the fabric, snip off enough 2"      wide fabric tape to place over seams. Double-over cut edges      and staple edges of fabric panels to the wood, mugging well      and stapling into corners and pulling fabric over flat      areas as tight as you can. Then apply successive coats of      paint (under the second coat put painting tape over seams)      till you have a smooth surface. Let the children help paint      too; they love it, and modern latex enamels wash off little      hands and out of clothes so long as you don't let them dry      hard.    </p>    <p>      You can do a more modern job by replacing the fabric with      more costly, but vastly stronger, fiberglass mat and      replacing canoe paint with two-part epoxy      resin-obtainable with directions at any      boating-supply house. The resin comes in two parts; mixed      together and with color added, it is applied over the      fiberglass just as paint goes over cloth and will make a      glossy minipool. (DO NOT let small kids help apply the      resin, which is caustic and emits vinegary fumes till      cured.)    </p>        <p>      <strong>Land Medium</strong>    </p>    <p>      Kids need something to make land out of. Sod looks good for      a few minutes but quickly becomes sodden and gets the water      muddy. Crushed rock is arguably the best, as its corners      and many angular faces help it stay put better in water      than sand or gravel. The heavier pebbles in gravel make      more stable land areas under water than sand. Kids will      bring in rocks, clumps of sod, grass and leaves, and who      knows what all else, and the table can look a proper mess      at the end of a day's play. It is easy to move gravel      around under water with the hose to wash out peanut butter      sandwich leavings, while fine sand grains will compact and      hold trash.    </p>    <p>      Unless you want to enforce schooltype discipline, the kids      will splash and throw water. Crushed rock or gravel will      stay put on the bottom while sand will splash out with the      water, to get into silky young hair and small eyes.    </p>    <p>      Crushed rock and washed gravel are available from any      aggregate-supply outlet. You won't want a dump truck full      and you can buy it in bags, or you can get crushed marble      and other decorative rock at most large nurseries. For a      small table, you might find it easiest to buy      fish-tank-bottom gravel from the pet store. The cheapest is      natural stone, though the kids love to mix up a variety of      virulent neon colors that hurt my eyes. Adding a new bag of      a fresh color once in a while will enliven a slow      afternoon.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Moving Water</strong>    </p>    <p>      Remember when you were a kid, how fascinating it was to      play in a little stream? You could dam it up, float sticks      down it, and imagine you were Tom Sawyer rafting the      Mississippi. Block up one end of the water table an inch or      two, with shorter supports every few inches downhill, hold      the end of the garden hose in one corner with a brick, and      leave the water on in a small flow. Let the overflow run      over at the other end or drill drain holes to control water      level. Experiment so water flow is strong enough to flow      through but not so strong it erodes "land" areas. If it is      the dry season, you can conserve water by running the      overflow to your garden or permanent plantings.    </p>    <p>      You can attach elaborate faucets and drain cocks, but they      just add weight. And you'll want td be able to move the      table each day, lest the lawn under it become a swamp. A 1      1/2" hole in the bottom with a sink drain plug will ease      emptying. A pair of 2" x 3"s with ends cut in an up angle      and screwed to the bottom of the table, with a rope loop at      one end, will make one-parent moving easier.    </p>    <h3>      TOYS FOR SAND & WATER    </h3>    <p>      Sand and water are fluid materials that kids will configure      as their imaginations dictate. But, if castle walls,      riverside piers, or Matchbox-car garages are to be much      more than humps in the sand, young builders need something      rigid to form or reinforce walls, platforms, and roofs.      Plus, the children need mobile toys to carry their      imaginations through the formed media.    </p>    <p>      Long, narrow wooden blocks are better for reinforcing sand      castles than conventional squares and rectangles. Wooden      wheeled excavators and trucks are good to move the sand      around. Plus, they will float to serve as boats, barges,      bridges, and rafts on the water table.    </p>    <p>      I made blocks and toy sand movers from woodshop scraps:      hardwood left over from furniture projects and softwood      from building-materials cutoffs. You'll have a few feet of      2" x 3" and plywood left over from making the water table.      If you don't have a shop of your own, see if you can      salvage leftovers from a local lumber finisher, a      commercial furniture maker, or a neighborhood woodworker.      Check building sites for ends of 2-by framing lumber and      other scrap. You might see if local hardware stores,      supermarkets, outdoor sports, or camping goods outlets, or      roadside stands sell wood stove or vacation camp fire      kindling. Stores near me sell plastic-wrapped packages of      assorted factory scrap hardwood for $3.00-expensive      to start a fire, but far less than you'd pay for the      equivalent board-footage of raw building stock.    </p>    <p>      Or, buy a few lengths of good clear 2" x 3" or 2" x 2"      lumber, some 4/5" x 4" decking-board stock, and several      feet of square, round, slat, and L-shaped hard pine or      poplar trim stock, and saw it to length. I have an electric      cutoff/miter saw that produces square ends automatically      and quickly. You can get the same result at less cost with      an inexpensive plastic miter box and muscle-powered      backsaw.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sand-Building Blocks</strong>    </p>    <p>      To prevent splinters, choose closegrained, well-dried wood      that is hard enough your thumbnail can't make much of a      dent in it. For sand-pit play, cut any size board from a 2"      x 4" stud to 1/2" x 2" wood lath or 1 1/2"- or 2"-diameter      dowel into 4", 6", and 8" lengths. Much smaller blocks      disappear in sand. Larger blocks are out of sand-castle      scale and too easily become kid weapons when the inevitable      squabbles erupt. Sand all blocks well, especially ends      rough-cut across the grain. At minimum, seal with a coat or      two of deck sealer. For more elaborate finish options, see      below.    </p>    <p>      Strips of plywood will be used to make roads, roofs of      buildings, and walls. Make up a bunch-4" wide and 6",      8", and 10" long. Raw plywood will warp and delaminate in      the weather, so soak it well in a hard finish.    </p>    <h3>      SAND TOYS    </h3>    <p>      I made up a bunch of simple earth movers. Each design      illustrated represents a different combination of      construction options that you can mix and match in designs      you or kids make yourselves.    </p>    <p>      Bodies were made from 2" x 4" or 2" x 3" softwood or by      gluing and clamping strips of hardwood or plywood scrap and      sanding so joints largely disappear. I used Titebond      waterproof glue, a "space-age" indoor/outdoor wood adhesive      that requires no mixing as does epoxy.    </p>    <p>      Using a Forstner bit that produces straight-sided,      flat-bottomed holes, I drilled bodies to accept those      little round "peoples" that come with several brands of      wheeled toys ...or you can turn your own if you have a      lathe.    </p>    <p>      You can also make your own wheels on a lathe, or using a      circle cutter on a drill press or a hole saw on your      portable drill. Ready-made wheels in several designs and      sizes are available at craft and hobby stores or from the      mail-order catalogs that advertise in woodworking      magazines.    </p>    <p>      Between painted or varnished bodies and wheels, I inserted      enough fiber washers to prevent rubbing.    </p>    <p>      The following are brief explanations of how to piece      together a few models (see illustrations on page 54), but      there's room for versatility of design, so feel free.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pusher</strong> The body of this minidozer is made      from a block of 2" x 3" building stud, the blade from      1/2"-thick hardwood. Three sets of wood wheels are fastened      with waterproof wood glue to 3/8 dowel axles. Axles are set      into grooves carved into under-body and held on by a      hardwood strip fastened with rustproof wood screws. No      drilling (or drill) required, and easy to make and repair.      Finish is minimal and intentionally rough: two coats of      deck-sealer (sanding between), to accept a child's crayons      or marker, yet clean off reasonably well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Scooper</strong> Joints are screwed and glued      except for the scoop, which is made from thin, oak      box-making stock (or plywood) and joined with dovetails      made by eye with a coping saw with fine blade and a      1/4"blade hand chisel (easier than you think-try it;      just keep the chisel razor sharp). For strength, hardwood      fillets (from the flying model or doll-making section of a      craftsupplies store) are glued at inside corners of scoop.      The wheels are held on by 3/8" wheel pegs glued into 3/8      holes drilled in the body. Gives the best-finished look,      but the peg axle is relatively fragile and difficult to      repair. To show off the joinery, parts are stained with      contrasting colors, glued sparingly, filled, and      spray-varnished to a craft-store shine.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hauler</strong> Made with a 2"-3" softwood body      with plywood base/bed. Wood wheels of this flatbed truck      are held on with short 1/8"-shanked brass wood screws set      into pilot holes drilled into hard dowel plugs that have      been glued into holes into the softwood truck body. Be sure      to use screws with round heads, as tops of flathead screws      have sharp edges. Parts were filled and painted before      final assembly, then, were given a several coats of clear.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Roller</strong> Body is made of three strips cut      from a 916" x 2" strip of white oak scrap, notched to      accept wheels, and laminated together with glue and brass      wood screws. The fat, turned-maple wheels are attached with      3/8" wooden wheel pegs. The example pictured was left      natural, filled, sanded, and sprayed with several coats of      clear acrylic to produce a craft-store finish.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Finishing</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most children have to be discouraged from marking or      coloring on toys-especially on smooth, carefully      varnished, inside-use wood blocks and rolling toys. Our      blocks are for outdoors, however, and I find that kids      adore being allowed, even encouraged, to use crayons,      markers, or paints to turn the building blocks into girders      (or magic wands) ...and to draw spokes and mufflers (or a      flowered border) on the wheeled earth-moving toys.    </p>    <p>      Probably most satisfactory to most young children is for      you to soak the wood in a colorless outdoor sealer (made      for decks), and let the children do a quick finish sanding      and then decorate with water paints, crayons, or washable      markers. The colors will wear off quickly, and I've found      that the kids will get the urge to redecorate several times      over a summer.    </p>    <p>      Some kids-mainly boys aged 6 to 8 who are future high      school Wheelheads-love vehicles with wheels that      leave aggressive-looking tread marks in moist sand. You can      give your tread-maker a narrowedged wood file and let him      make grooves or notches or crosses in the wheels of his      favorite sand vehicle to leave personalized "treads." Black      marker will give tires a satisfying color.    </p>    <p>      Exposed to a summer of sun and rain, unfinished wood will      weather to a mottled gray that isn't very attractive to an      adult eye, but doesn't seem to reduce play value to the      kids. Bring the blocks and toys in come fall, hose off the      sand, bleach with diluted Chlorox or a wood bleach, and      store till next winter-when you and the children can      refurbish them.    </p>    <p>      Refinishing or rebuilding the sand toys can be a powerful      hint of warm weather to come and become a late-winter      family ritual much like carving pumpkins on Halloween. Our      kids would get all excited, bundle up in snowsuits and      boots, take the wooden toys out to the sandpit (still      buried under a yard of snow), play with them in the snow      for a while, andof course-leave them buried there. So long      as we kept the dogs from carrying the good-chewing wood      blocks off, building blocks and sand movers would sink as      snow melted and be in place and ready to excavate when the      weather warmed in the spring.    </p>    <p>      A few fastidious young ones and many older kids who are      developing a precocious sense of order will resist marking      on toys or having toys that look "dirty." For them-or      to satisfy your own sense of order-you can give the      blocks and toys a better finish. Easiest is to assemble      toys, then preserve the wood in one step with several coats      of outdoor wood preserving sealer/stain. For a better job,      before assembling, sand the wood smooth-slightly,      rounding only those sharp corners that will be exposed      after assembly. Treat exposed faces with several coats of a      good sanding sealer (sanding lightly between coats). Spray      parts with several coats of nontoxic exterior-grade enamel,      truck bodies in bright colors, and wheels in black or      bright with black tires. Assemble and then, for a toy-store      finish, spray with thin coats of clear outdoor acrylic      finish.    </p>    <p>      Illustrations:    </p>    <p>      Building the Sandbox<br /> Building the Water Table    </p>
