                <p>      <strong>Handworks</strong>    </p>        <p>      Michelle Silver picks up the      weaving habit again and discovers a new world beyond the      grammar-school pot holder.    </p>        <p>      Weaving, the interlacing of two materials, is one of the      oldest skills in the world. It's done by holding one set of      parallel threads so that you can cross a second set of      threads over and under the first set to form a fabric.    </p>    <p>      How much time and money you spend is entirely up to you. As      a beginner, I made my own frame loom, bought some cheap      yarn, and was on my way for under $10.    </p>    <p>      Professionals may spend as much as $3000 on a loom, an      apparatus that speeds up the over-and-under process by      raising the preselected threads. Exotic mohair and silk      yarns can cost as much as $10 an ounce. There is even a      computer program now, called Combby 8, that allows you to      design your own pattern and transmit it to your loom; it      will automatically pick up all of the threads you selected      for your individual pattern.    </p>    <p>      "Have you ever woven before?" Judy Steinkoenig asks. She's      the co-owner of a local weaving shop and my instructor.    </p>    <p>      Sure I'd woven. There was the set of square pot holders I      made in grade school. And shortly thereafter, I bought      myself a weaving kit complete with fabric ties and plastic,      red loom. It wasn't long before I filled the kitchen with a      colorful assortment of more useless pot holders. Within a      few weeks, Mom ceased being impressed, and I didn't know      what else to make, so I threw away the loom and retired      early.    </p>    <p>      Judy swears she never once made a pot holder. In fact, she      never even tried weaving until she was married and home      rais ing her one-year-old son. She was in dire need of a      hobby when she discovered a local weaving course.    </p>    <p>      "I had tried pottery and cross-stitching, but everything      called for specific patterns," Judy says. "My grandmother      tried to teach me to knit and ended up telling me I was      hopeless. I just didn't understand it and there was no      freedom in it for me. Weaving was a craft I understood, and      I found I could make wonderful things."    </p>    <p>      Her favorite advice is: "Be a kid. A lot of adults will ask      me how their projects are going to turn out if they do such      and such. I'll tell them I don't know, try it; find out.      Kids are much more willing to experiment. They'll change      their weaving patterns all the time, and they're not as      tough on themselves when they make mistakes."    </p>    <p>      If there is one thing I learned that afternoon, it's that      weaving calls for patience. While some may find the process      tedious, many will find weaving a good way to escape stress      for a while. In fact, according to Judy, a number of      students are professionals in high-tech jobs who have      chosen weaving as a creative outlet.    </p>    <p>      On the next page are instructions for making a      plain-weaving project on a hand-built wooden-frame loom. If      you wish to add complexity, experiment with different      textures and types of yarn. Weave in other materials: dried      flowers, weeds, lace, rags, etc.    </p>    <p>      One unique aspect of this project is that you will decide      when it is done. I decided a table mat would be enough of a      challenge to begin my weaving endeavor. If I kept on going,      I could have made an intricate wall hanging. If I had      stopped earlier, I could have made, well ...a pot holder.    </p>            <h3>      Materials    </h3>    <p>      For frame: -four pieces of 2' x 1 1/2" hardwood (frame can      be larger or smaller if you like) -drill -four 1" screws      -four 1" corner brackets -sharp knife Note: You can buy a      wooden loom for under $20 at many weaving-supply shops.    </p>    <p>      For weaving: -roll of string -yarn -16" shuttle ($3 to $4)      -16" shed or "pickup" stick ($7 to $8)    </p>    <h3>      For Frame    </h3>    <p>      Form a square or rectangle with your hardwood pieces. Place      a bracket in one of the inside corners of your frame and      make a pencil mark inside the two bracket holes. Remove the      brackets and drill holes at the marks; then replace the      brackets and drill in the screws. Repeat with other three      corners. Then, with a sharp knife, cut six to eight small      grooves per inch on the inside top and inside bottom of      your frame. Be careful to make certain that the grooves on      the top and bottom of the frame line up exactly.    </p>    <h3>      Warping the Frame    </h3>    <p>      Tie the end of your string around the first groove at the      upper left-hand corner of your frame, and knot. Then bring      the string end down over the frame opening, into the first      bottom groove, and back up to the second groove on top.      Continue stringing through all of the grooves, keeping the      tension taut (not so taut that the strings could break).      When you reach the right-hand side of the frame, tie the      string around the last groove and make a knot before      cutting. This set of vertical strings is called "the warp."    </p>    <p>      Next, lift your shuttle and wrap a bunch of yarn around it      in a figure-eight formation. This will be the yarn for your      horizontal weave, or "weft."    </p>    <h3>      Plain Weave    </h3>    <p>      Grab the shed stick in your right hand and, starting at the      right-hand side of your frame, pick up the first string      with it. Leave the second string and pick up the third.      Continue picking up every other string so that it runs past      the frame and then rotate the stick so it is resting on its      side. This will further raise all of the strings you have      just picked up. The space between the raised and lower      strings is called "the shed."    </p>    <p>      Starting at the right-hand side, pull the shuttle through      the shed (passing it to your left hand) to the other side;      do not pull so tight that you distort the left-hand warp.      Now use a fork to push the yarn down toward the bottom of      the frame. If you wish to have a fringe on your mat, leave      one or two inches between this weave, or "shot," and the      bottom of the frame.    </p>    <p>      Next, pick up the warp again with your shed stick. This      time start with the second string, and continue picking up      every other weft thread. (These will be all of the strings      you ignored the first time around.) Again, rotate the stick      and pull your shuttle through (starting from the left this      time). Pull this new shot down to the first one with your      fork. Repeat from the beginning. If you miss a string with      your shed stick once or twice, don't worry about      it-it won't show up. Note: You may wish to go over      two and under two to achieve a "basket weave:" Or go under      one and over three to achieve a "rib weave:'    </p>    <p>      Continue weaving until you reach the size you desire. If      you wish to fill the whole frame, remember to leave the      same amount of room for the fringe at the top that you left      at the bottom of the frame. Don't worry; your fabric is      interlaced and will not come apart. To make the fringe, tie      three or four pieces of string into a knot as close to the      weave as possible. Wash the final piece to give it a      finished look.    </p>    <p>      For plans or more information, call Judy Steinkoenig at      Shuttles, Spindles & Skeins, Inc. (303) 494-1077.    </p>
