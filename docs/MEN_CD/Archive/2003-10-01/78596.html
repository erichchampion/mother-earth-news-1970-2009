I wasn't      surprised. For the past year, the car had grown rusty boils      and stains, while pieces had chipped off in my hands like      tree bark. Plus, the locks now froze in the snow, the      speedometer light bulb had been burned out for months and      the headlights looked dim as yellow parchment against the      Catskills forest at night.    </p>    <p>      I'd miss this rugged little car. Bought used, it had served      me well for five years of living in a log cabin and      enjoying the sort of driving experiences on wilderness      roads that many Americans only know from sports utility      vehicle commercials.    </p>    <p>      But nothing lasts forever. I was ready for a new car. I      wanted a hybrid.    </p>    <p>      By combining an electric motor with a gasoline engine,      hybrid technology enables cars to get much better gas      mileage than the norm. Although every environmentalist      likes the idea of better fuel economy, hybrids still are      something of a novelty.    </p>    <p>      In my case, a recent trip to the Arctic National Wildlife      Refuge had turned mileage into a personal issue. My      girlfriend and I backpacked and rafted for 18 days through      the refuge. We saw wolves and grizzlies, musk oxen and      caribou migrating by the hundreds. To us, it felt like the      last edge of the North American continent that our modern      civilization hadn't conquered. On the 19th day, we visited      the Prudhoe Bay oil complex, a military-like network of      drilling pads, pipelines, gravel roads and processing      plants spread across an area the size of Rhode island. If      allowed to extend eastward into the refuge, the oil complex      threatened to destroy the wild beauty of that landscape.    </p>    <p>      When we returned home, I began looking for a "greener"      replacement for my Sentra. I'd first heard of the hybrid      concept in 1996 as a journalist traveling with a      solar-electric car rally from New York City to Washington,      D.C. The great debate at the rally was whether hybrids      would replace electrics as the green vehicle of choice.    </p>    <p>      The purists still defended electrics, confident they could      overcome the problem of having to plug in and recharge      their vehicles about every 100 miles. But sever al veteran      "advocates persuaded me hybrids would be more practical.      Yes, they'd still have polluting tailpipes, but they'd get      better mileage than vehicles totally dependent on gasoline      and still travel the same distances between fill-ups.      Hybrids actually improve upon the performance of straight      gasoline vehicles because their electric motors provide      more power and acceleration.    </p>    <p>      When I went shopping for my replacement car, I found two      hybrid choices: the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight.      <em>(After Nixon wrote this article, Honda released its      hybrid Civic model. For more information on current and      future hybrids, see "Greener Cars and Trucks," Page</em>      <em>46.-MOTHER)</em> For professional critics, the      choice was clear. National Public Radio's "Car Talk"      brothers raved about the Prius on their Web site: "It's a      tree-hugger's dream that anyone could be happy with," they      said, unlike the Insight, which "makes too many      compromises." <em>Consumer Reports</em> found the Prius "a      viable alternative to any small sedan," while the      "Insight's ride is stiff, its handling less than nimble,      and its cabin very noisy."    </p>    <p>      Through my e-mail network, I found friends who had owned a      Prius for a year. They drove the same mountain roads I did      and shared my environmental sentiments. They loved their      Prius, and that was a strong endorsement. I accepted their      invitation to take the car out for a spin and soon sat in      the lap of luxury.    </p>    <p>      The hybrid moment came at a stop sign when the gas engine      turned itself off to save a sip of fuel. The Prius idled as      silently as an electric clock. "We haven't stalled," my      friend reassured me. "Just press the gas pedal." The engine      purred again. From there, he directed me to the bottom of      a, steep hill to prove the car was as powerful as any other      sedan. He was tight: The Prius shot uphill so fast my foot      never quite reached the floor.    </p>    <p>      To be a savvy consumer, however, I decided to drive an      Insight for comparison. At the local Honda dealership, I      found one in the lot, still half-wrapped from the factory      with brown paper covering the hood. Unlike the Prius, which      resembled a conventional sedan except for its shortened      hood, the Insight looked futuristic: part sports coupe,      part hatchback and very aerodynamic. Later, I learned the      Insight's front wheels actually are spread 4 inches wider      than the rear wheels, which helps air flow around the      tapered body. The most striking difference from other cars,      though, was that the rear wheels were largely hidden behind      metal covers that blended in with the body and prevented      wind from catching in the wheel wells. It gave the Insight      a diminutive appearance compared to many vehicles that show      off their big tires as a sign of ruggedness.    </p>    <p>      To a sedan owner like myself, the Insight looked small. If      this car was basically an aerodynamic cockpit, I couldn't      afford it. I needed the storage space and the sturdiness of      a conventional car. The hatchback didn't look promising for      space, and the metal skirt below the bumpers and doors made      the car sit so low that I wondered if it would scrape every      rock on dirt roads.    </p>    <p>      The Honda salesman invited me to crouch down and compare my      Sentra's clearance. The Insight wasn't any lower, he      explained, it just looked that way because of its      aerodynamic body skirt. I had to admit he was right.      Buckled in the driver's seat, I didn't find the Insight so      small after all. I did sit lower than I sat in my Sentra,      but I had more leg room.    </p>    <p>      During the test drive, I spotted the miles-per-gallon      number in liquid crystal green on the instrument display      panel. In the past, I'd met mileage nerds who kept a      notebook in the glove compartment to record fill-ups and      odometer readings in order to calculate mpg for themselves,      but this car does the math for you. So far, the Insight had      gotten 48.1 mpg from the dealer's lot to the highway      entrance ramp. Noticing my fascination, the salesman had me      push a button that switched the reading from a digital      number to a bar graph that pulsed back and forth, giving      the mpg at that moment. Shifting from second to third gear      on the entrance ramp, I saw my mpg slip to 30, but after      entering traffic and reaching cruising speed, I eased off      the gas and saw it shoot to 150 and stay there. I hadn't      been so amazed by a machine since the first time I logged      onto the Internet.    </p>    <p>      <em>By combining an electric motor with a gasoline engine,      hybrid technology enables cars to get much better fuel      mileage than the norm.</em>    </p>    <p>      Back at the Honda lot, I asked the salesman to open the      hatchback. I needed to be reminded of why I shouldn't buy      this car. It didn't have a trunk. It didn't have a rear      seat. It wouldn't be practical for my life in a log cabin      in the mountains where the local guys drove pickup trucks.    </p>    <p>      But the carpeted storage space was roomier than I expected.      And the salesman lifted a lid in the floor to reveal a      sunken storage box as large as a beach cooler. What did I      load in my Nissan Sentra anyway? The truth was, as a      bachelor, I'd probably driven 115,000 miles by myself, and      another 5,000 with my girlfriend. How many times had I      carried a third or fourth passenger? A dozen? Most of the      time, my storage space had been dead weight.    </p>    <p>      I also compared the specs: The U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency rated the Insight at 61 mpg for city      driving and 68 mpg for highway driving, while it rated the      Prius at 52 mpg urban, 45 mpg highway. (Later, I learned      these EPA figures are inflated by some old-fashioned      assumptions about our driving habits, such as the idea that      we average 48 mph on the highway, which may have been true      in the 70s. Today, the average is closer to 60 mph.)    </p>    <p>      But the critics loved the Prius. My friends loved the      Prius. I needed to talk with someone who drove an Insight      in the real world. Through my environmental contacts, I      finally found someone: A solar entrepreneur who lived a      mile up a dirt road in Maine. Over the phone, he didn't      sound impressed by my concerns. "I've never put on my      chains," he said, apparently insulted I would question the      Insight's handling in snow. As for storage, he and his wife      easily had stowed their gear in the hatchback for a 10-day      vacation that summer. And if I lacked the conviction to      choose the Insight, he certainly hoped I wouldn't buy a      Prius.    </p>    <p>      "Why not?" I asked. Who could dislike the Prius? Besides      the oil companies?    </p>    <p>      "It's full of compromises," he said. "It only gets 48 mpg."      And he proceeded to explain how this sedan had sacrificed      mileage performance for luxury. "Actually," he continued,      "I'd get better mileage with a diesel car, such as a      Volkswagen Jetta or Golf. Of course, diesels have terrible      tailpipe emissions, but I could easily clean up that      problem by converting the car to run on biodiesel, thereby      cutting my unburned hydrocarbon emissions by 93 percent."    </p>    <p>      "Where would I find biodiesel?" I asked. "At my Web site,"      he answered. Through the wonders of online shopping, I      could order 55-gallon drums of biodiesel, which would be      delivered by truck to my driveway. I can't say his proposal      didn't have some appeal. The promise of greater      self-sufficiency often does. I already lived in a log cabin      with my own well for drinking water, my own wood stove for      heat and my own sewage system. Why not tell the oil sheiks      to stuff it?    </p>    <p>      But the idea of becoming my own filling station had      problems. First, I shared the driveway with my neighbor,      who'd been so nasty the time he found a cord of firewood      dumped for me that I could only imagine his fury at a      permanent row of barrels. Second, I was the sort of      negligent shopper who routinely let my refrigerator sit      empty for a week. With biodiesel, I couldn't very well      recover from my absent-mindedness by using a local filling      station until my fuel shipment arrived.    </p>    <p>      So I bought an Insight. And I got lucky by finding a used      one, only 10 months old with 14,700 miles, yet $5,000 less      than the new model I tested. As an owner, I've learned a      few more things about this car. For example, the electric      motor isn't really the secret to its high mileage. Rather,      the Insight is much more aerodynamic and much lighter than      conventional cars because it is constructed with aluminum      body parts (a steel framework within protects passengers).    </p>    <p>      With only three cylinders, the gasoline engine happens to      be the smallest you can find in a car, yet it's so      efficient that it produces 20 percent more power (for its      size) than the engines in most new cars. The hybrid's      engine can afford to be this small because the electric      motor boosts it through weak spots.    </p>    <p>      I admit it: I've become a mileage nerd with my own notebook      in the glove compartment. After 20,000 miles in this past      year, I can report that the Insight's best fill-up came in      Tennessee after several long, hot days on the interstate      when a tankful finished at 68.3 mpg. Its worst-54.5      mpg-arrived in November after two weeks of toddling      around town in cold weather. Usually, I get from 58 to 63      mpg, depending on the weather and the amount of highway      driving.    </p>    <p>      The only person to complain has been my girlfriend. I've      overheard her with friends: "What does he say when he walks      in the door? Not, 'Honey, I'm home!' No. He says, '62.3!"'      But I know what she really means: "When are you going to      lend me the keys?"    </p>    <p>      Will Nixon is an essayist and poet who lives in the      Catskill Mountains of New York.
