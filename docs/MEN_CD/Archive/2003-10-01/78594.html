                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Dirty Diesels?    </h2>    <p>      Diesels generally don't make the green grade, says the      ACEEE. That's because, even though they consume less fuel      than their gasoline counterparts and therefore release      fewer greenhouse gas emissions per mile driven, diesels      spew far more particulates and other nasties from their      tailpipes than conventional gas engines. Nitrogen oxides,      sulfur oxides and hydrocarbons, all pollutants that cause      urban smog, contribute to global warning and negatively      impact human health.    </p>    <p>      But don't discount diesels just yet: they're trying to      clean up their act. Today's diesels pollute much less than      those of yesteryear. And as prices at the pump continue to      climb and savvy shoppers demand more fuel-efficient (and      cleaner) vehicles, manufactures are responding with      advanced emission control technologies that will allow      diesels to meet forthcoming EPA emissions standards.    </p>    <p>      Some enterprising individuals, reluctant to relinquish      their old, classic diesel workhorses (diesels are      well-known for their long-lived engines), are turning to      biodiesel to tidy up their tailpipes. Derived from      vegetable oils and animal fats, biodiesel is a cleaner,      greener fuel that significantly reduces end emissions,      especially sulfur oxides and hydrocarbons.<br />      <br />      Using biodiesel fuel requires few or no engine      modifications; some drivers even report smoother running      cars and, sometimes, a little hike in fuel economy. The      primary obstacles to increased biodiesel use are its higher      cost (B20, a blend of 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent      petro-diesel, costs 13 to 22  cents more per gallon than      standard diesel fuel), and limited availability and      production capacity. Only a handful of public biodiesel      stations operate in the United States, although the number      is steadily growing.    </p>    <p>      Other folks are circumventing the commercial biodiesel      industry by starting biodiesel co-ops and making their own      fuel from used vegetable oil harvested from the local      greasy spoon. And even more advanced gear heads are      converting their diesel engines to run on pure vegetable      oil. Conversion kits, which require some wrench finesse and      auto know-how, can be purchased online from www.greasel.com      . Biodiesel may not solve all our energy woes, but it may      help in the transition from fossil fuels.
