                <p>      INTERVIEW    </p>                <p>      Should anyone care to sow the seeds of agricultural      revolution in this country, he or she would probably get      them from Wes Jackson. For the past 16 years, the      freethinking geneticist and his colleagues at the Land      Institute in Salina, Kansas, have searched for plants that      will see us through the next century. These plants, Jackson      believes, will produce bountiful crops year after year      without pesticides or fertilizers. More important, however,      they won't need annual tillage, a practice used since men      quit chasing mammoths.    </p>    <p>      Jackson's influence goes beyond mere seeds. In three books      and numerous essays, this descendant of four generations of      Kansas farmers has excoriated modern agriculture for      ravaging land and people. The 58-year-old scientist has      been dubbed a "maverick geneticist," a "prairie prophet,"      even "the father of sustainable agriculture." He dismisses      labels with the wave of a callused hand. "I've told people      I'm not a prophet; I'm head of a nonprofit organization,"      he chuckles.    </p>    <p>      Yet it is hard for Jackson not to sound Isaiah-like when      the damage wrought by agriculture has reached biblical      proportions. The topsoil that makes U.S. farmers the      greatest producers in the world currently erodes at 20      times its rate of replenishment. Iowa, the backbone of the      Corn Belt, has shed half its topsoil in the last 150 years,      while the nation on average has lost a third. A recent      geological study suggests that the world's farmers displace      the same amount of soil each year as the glaciers of the      last ice age.    </p>    <p>      The natural fertility and pest resistance inherent in      healthy soils have largely been replaced by fertilizers and      pesticides made from fossil fuels. Farmers apply some 20      million tons of fertilizer and more than one billion pounds      of pesticide each year, traces of which have been detected      in the waters of at least 40 states. Concern over the      long-term effects of these substances recently prompted the      National Cancer Institute to launch a 10-year, $15 million      study of 100,000 farmers, chemical applicators, and their      families.    </p>    <p>      Most researchers look toward technology to solve these      problems. Jackson looks to nature, specifically the hardy      prairie perennials that he hopes one day will replace frail      corn and wheat. In less than two decades of selections and      crosses, Land Institute researchers have achieved yields of      Illinois bundleflower and wild senna comparable to wheat      yields in the region. They have demonstrated greater yields      in polycultures (mixtures of species) than in monocultures,      as well as natural reduction of certain pests and diseases.    </p>    <p>      These findings prove that a new agriculture is possible,      Jackson says-one without soil erosion, without      chemical contamination, and with little fossil fuel input.      In place of an eroding Breadbasket, Jackson envisions a      domestic prairie that nurtures land, people, and community.    </p>    <p>      To understand the human element, Jackson has focused on      Matfield Green, a not-quite-dead ghost town in the Kansas      Flint Hills. He calls the project "setting up the books for      ecological community accounting." By studying the hamlet as      part of the prairie ecosystem, he hopes to gain insight      into the decline of thousands of towns that dot the Great      Plains.    </p><p>These towns, he argues in his latest book, <em>Becoming    Native to This Place</em> (University Press of Kentucky,    1994), offer the perfect opportunity to repopulate rural    America. Twenty-five years after the backto-the-land movement    spawned MOTHER, Wes Jackson calls for a third of the U.S.    population to move closer to the source that sustains it.</p>    <p>      "The binge the developed world has enjoyed is about over;"      Jackson writes. "It's time to find our way home and use      what little time is left for partial redemption of this      prodigal generation."    </p>    <p>      We spoke with Jackson as he prepared for his greatest      challenge: convincing a skeptical U.S. Department of      Agriculture to embrace perennial polyculture research. He      may be up to the task. The renowned geneticist was selected      as a Pew Conservation Scholar in 1990 and a MacArthur      Fellow in 1992. He has written two previous books, <em>New      Roots for Agriculture</em> (University of Nebraska Press,      1980) and <em>Altars of Unhewn Stone: Science and the      earth</em> . (North Point Press, 1987).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Joel Bourne for Mother:</strong>On the road to      Salina I saw a sign that read, "One Kansas farmer feeds 101      people and YOU!" I suspect you feel this is not a source of      pride.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wes Jackson:</strong>That's a sign of failure. You      have to ask, so now what is everybody else doing that's so      important? What is it that is more important than taking      care of the land that sustains us? The Buddhists believe      that the purpose of work is to come together with others in      a common task in order to overcome our egocentricity. They      don't see work as merely a utilitarian thing, rather it's      to help us toward a becoming existence.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong>    </p>    <p>      You and your friend Wendell Berry and other leaders in the      movement to reform agriculture have often been criticized      as merely being nostalgic for pastoral America. How do you      answer that charge?<br />      <strong>T00 PRODUCTIVE FOR OUR OWN GOOD?</strong><br />      <br />      "One Kansas farmer feeds 101 people and you."<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong>    </p>    <p>      What are we really talking about when we talk about people      being associated with farming? Aren't we talking about      being in an environment in which there is a combination of      biotic, abiotic and cultural diversity, and at the same      time understanding the nature of our source? The idea that      the majority of citizens don't need to know where their      food comes from, or to know it only at an intellectual      level without sensing it at what we might call an emotional      level, places our culture in spiritual danger.    </p>    <p>      Last night I was reading Liberty Hyde Bailey, the grand old      dean of the school of agriculture at Cornell University.      Here is a teacher's leaflet, dated June 1, 1897, in which      Bailey defined, "What is nature study": "It simply trains      the eye and the mind to see and to comprehend the common      things of life; and the result is not directly the      acquirement of science ...but the establishment of a living      sympathy with everything that is ...."    </p>    <p>      This is what we're talking about. It's not a matter of      whether there is some kind of utilitarian meeting of      physical needs. We're talking about a living sympathy with      everything that is. The leaflet asks, "Now why is the      College of Agriculture of Cornell University interesting      itself in this work? It is trying to help the farmer, and      it begins with the most teachable point-the child.      The district school cannot teach agriculture any more than      it can teach law or engineering or any other profession or      trade, but it can interest the child in nature and in rural      problems and thereby fasten its sympathies to the country."      You see, there's the word sympathy showing up twice. "The      child will teach the parent. The coming generation will see      the result. In the interest of humanity and country, we ask      for help."    </p>    <p>      We're not talking about a matter of mere nostalgia. We are      talking about a practical necessity. We are losing the      cultural seed stock. I think that was Wendell's phrase      originally. It's the beginning of a decline in the      civilization.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Here you have the dean of one of the      most prestigious agricultural schools in the country      talking in 1897 about the very things that concern you      today. How did we get so far away from this ideal?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I'll call it an operating hypothesis.      It may even be a law. High energy destroys information, of      both the cultural and biological varieties. In other words,      with the industrialization of society, including the      industrialization of agriculture, we have an eroding of      information. The war against cultural diversity, indigenous      cultures, subsistence farming-places where there is a      lot of cultural information-is the same war that is      being waged against tropical rain forests. Cultural      information, like biological information, is hard won      through disease, death, anguish-a consequence of hard      experience. But it is vulnerable during periods of      affluence. It just gets jettisoned. It wasn't until after      World War II that the benefits of the industrial revolution      visited an entire culture.    </p>        <p>      Look, here is the entire      collection of The <em>Land Quarterly</em> , a journal      published from 1941 to 1954 by Friends of the Land, "a      nonprofit, nonpartisan society for the conservation of      soil, rain, and man." In here it tells about two field days      in which people were looking at eight soil conservation      projects in Ohio. I believe Hugh Hammond Bennett, the      founding chief of the Soil Conservation Service, set a      stone. How many people do you think attended that field      day?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> When was this?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I think in 1946 or '47.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> I have no idea.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> Eighty thousand! Now if we had 8,000      show up at a rally, we would say we've got a movement. But      here is passion that affluence has effectively destroyed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> At the risk of reducing this to sound      bites, I wondered if you would give me a handful of reasons      for abandoning industrial agriculture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> Number one. It creates a brittle      agricultural economy. When fossil fuel is gone, it leaves      us vulnerable.    </p>    <p>      Number two. There is a dependency on the chemical industry      that leads to contamination of water and soil that      ultimately gets back to us. What we've tried to do through      chemistry is what we used to do by hand, that, 135 years      after Darwin, ignores the implications of a Darwinian world      view; i.e., don't put chemicals out there we haven't      evolved with without counting them guilty until proven      innocent.    </p>    <p>      Then there is the loss of cultural seed stock from the      countryside that makes us vulnerable. I have heard that one      of the things that made Americans so formidable during      World War II was that when the equipment broke down, there      were enough farm boys around who were able to get the      equipment up and running again. They knew about motors and      drive trains and so on. The Germans on the other hand, had      excellent engineering and specialization, but the      run-of-the-mill German did not know how to fix the      equipment. So that was that.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> While most of your colleagues in the      field of genetics have enthusiastically embraced the new      technology of gene splicing, you have called for a      five-year moratorium on biotechnology. Why?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> Let's say you have a knife, and the      knife is in the hands of a person who cuts and serves      homemade bread. Then the knife is in the hands of a mugger.      Could be the same knife. In a similar manner the plant      breeder may decide to put his or her talents to use for      Monsanto.    </p>    <p>      Biotechnology, like all technology, is ultimately at the      service of a dominating social organization. Now if the      biotechnologist could be subordinate to the ecological      paradigm only, I would not be so bothered. My worry is that      something that involves such speed is another example of      overrunning our headlights. So I'm cautious. And it is so      tempting to the one who comes in and wants to use it for      exploitative purposes rather than ecological requirements.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> But as a plant breeder aren't you      just as tempted by the power of genetic manipulation as      your colleagues? What if USDA offered you millions to use      biotechnology to establish perennial polycultures?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> There is a difference though. You can      be infatuated with what you are able to do and be caught up      in the elegance and power that goes with gene splicing, or      you can see it as simply a tool to transfer genes from one      organism to another. I would have to say I would stick to      the fiveyear moratorium for myself as well. We really      haven't had a discussion about this. What I think we can do      is raise the consciousness of the whole culture about the      nature of technology. You have to ask who is going to      control that technology? Can it be controlled exclusively      by the public? Or is it susceptible to being controlled by      interests that will exploit people, land, and community.      There is the social justice side of it. At the same time,      how long will it be before the biotechnologists come up      with the ozone hole equivalent? If you start with the idea      that we are fundamentally ignorant, it forces us to      remember things, hope for second chances, and keep the      scale small. All this is part of the discussion.    </p>    <p>      We have not had ecological interests in mind as we have      sought technological tools. Historically the interests we      have had in mind have been profits. That is where the knife      has wounded us, rather than cutting bread that will sustain      us.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> You recently began a new project at      the Land Institute called Sunshine Farm. It's not      permaculture,but it incorporates many techniques of the      sustainable agriculture movement, including natural      fertilizers, draft animal power, and tractors running on      "biodiesel." What is your goal there?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> Fifteen years ago when people asked      how are you going to feed the world with perennial      polycultures, I knew that we needed an even playing field      for discussion. If we have an agriculture that runs on      contemporary sunlight, and receives no subsidies from the      extractive economy, then let's talk. So here are the      conventional crops: sorghum, wheat, sunflowers, alfalfa,      and so on. Now we've got a standard against which we can      judge the merits of perennial polyculture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> So it's a control.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> In a way it's a control. We'll just      see what these yields are without subsidies and make this      as close to a sunpowered system as possible. We'll use the      draft animals, and we will use the tractor run on vegetable      oil. We will get the land to sponsor the energy. Now we've      got something to compare. My bet is perennial polyculture      will beat the pants off annual monocultures grown in a      sustainable way.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> In your new book, <em>Becoming Native      to This Place</em> , you speak of the marriage of ecology      and agriculture. The assumption that nature is something to      be conquered is deeply imbedded in the human psyche. How      does society go about changing that?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I don't know. In the book I give a      glib history lesson. When the church dominated our thinking      we built cathedrals, supposedly to the glory of God, but      mostly to the glory of those who built cathedrals. Then      comes Enlightenment and the nation-state as that which      organizes our lives. This time we built national capitals.      That peaks in World War II with Hitler. Then economics      comes on as that which organizes our thinking. We still go      to church. We still vote as the nationstate. But with NAFTA      and GATT, Boeing can go to China and GM can go to Mexico,      so the nation-state is not important anymore. Just as the      church built cathedrals and the nation-state built national      capitals, now economics builds the shopping mall to the      glory of the gods of secular materialism.    </p>    <p>      So what's next? I think it's ecology. But this time what      will our icon be? Not a cathedral, not a national capital,      not a shopping mall. It will be wilderness: alpine meadows,      prairies, things not made by human hands. Now that we've      recognized the nature of the extractive economy, we will      look to nature's economy that is fundamentally renewable.      Alpine meadows, tropical rain forests, prairies, coral      reefs-those are economies that run on sunlight and      feature material recycling.    </p>    <p>      This is the whole purpose of Matfield Green. We call the      project "setting up the books for ecological community      accounting." We want to get a sense of carrying capacity      and the ecological cost of our livelihood.    </p>          <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> As I understand it, you are      attempting to compare the economy of the tallgrass prairie      to the economy of a tiny prairie community. Isn't that like      comparing an apple to a Model A?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> An accountant is a student of      boundaries. As a student of boundaries one must decide what      is relevant that goes through any particular boundary.      That's what we are trying to do in Matfield Green with the      things we take for granted. Take a loaf of bread. Throw a      boundary around that loaf of bread and let's get some sense      of what the ecological cost of that bread is if it is made      in a Tuscan-style wood-fired oven. See? We call bread the      staff of life. We think bread is benign. But bread may come      at a great ecological cost, if you count in soil erosion,      chemical contamination, fossil fuel dependency, fossil      water. Then put a similar boundary around Matfield Green      and then measure what goes through that boundary. We've got      all the chattel mortgage books going back to 1867. I bought      them for three dollars apiece. In there you see the coming      of the European mind-the human economy-smack      dab into nature's grassland economy.    </p>    <p>      We have a chance to look at the superimposition of an      economy which is the product of the European mind being      imposed upon an economy that has been running on sunlight      and look at what kind of externalized cost we are willing      to pay to put that system in place in order to carry out      our vision. As Wendell says, we came with vision but not      with sight. That's the kind of thing I want to do down      there: to get some idea of the overlay of the European mind      on the great grassland community.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Once you throw this ring around      Matfield Green and study every in and out, what do you      think you will find?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> We won't, of course, measure every in      and out, but I hope we can reveal where we might take our      more important first steps. Will it mean that we remove      ourselves? Do we become more community oriented and engage      in more barter? Do we hold more community dances and get      our solace from one another? Do we sign a pact that says we      turn the TV off certain nights of the week and visit with      one another? Are we going to trade potatoes for tomatoes?      What kind of relationship are we going to have with one      another?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> It sounds like rural anthropology.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> In a way it is. But I want to see how      far we can stretch the ecological paradigm. The native      prairie there runs on sunlight and it features material      recycling.So if the natural ecosystem community is going to      run that way, why shouldn't the human community look to see      what principles are at work that have allowed those systems      to follow certain rules for millions of years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> was born on Earth      Day 1970 as an outgrowth of the back-to-the-land movement.      In <em>Becoming</em> Native you have called for a similar      movement but on a much larger scale. How many people would      you like to see back on the land?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I don't think the countryside can take      more than 80 million people. That is less than a third of      the current U.S. population. But 80 million people on the      land would change the nature of our political economy. It      would be a very different world.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> How do we teach young people to dig      in, as you suggest, to go some place and begin "the long      search to becoming native?"    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I'd like to get universities to      recognize their obligation. I'm amused to contemplate      university professors offering a major in homecoming.      That's going to expose this culture more than anything. How      do you prepare the young to live sustainable lives? We lack      the skills. All of our skills in teaching are primarily      oriented to a major in upward mobility. If it weren't so      tragic it would be uproariously funny to watch the      universities thrash around to make that happen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> What words of encouragement do you      have for MOTHER readers who are already back on the land?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> The people who read the <em>Whole      Earth Catalog, Coevolution Quarterly</em> , and MOTHER,      that fooled around with ram pumps and yurt houses and      communal living and all sorts of things, created cultural      information that is still around. I would say that they are      the examples. They are the prototypes. They are the people      who have been running the necessary experiments. Even      though they may have failed, at least they have the      ideology. They know the promises and pitfalls better than      anyone else in the culture. They are seed stock. Maybe      these are the saving remnant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> In the last 25 years we've seen the      rise of environmentalism as well as conservatism. Do you      see us moving closer together toward a sustainable future      or are we heading for the poles?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I don't know. I've tried to understand      how this culture has become in such a short period of time      the most fundamentalist that it has ever been. It is      serious because fundamentalism takes over where thought      leaves off. I'm worried about fundamentalism of any type,      including ecofundamentalism, or religious fundamentalism or      politically correct fundamentalism. Instead of thinking and      being informed by affection and passion for the creation we      seem to be shrinking from it and we worship the gods of      secular materialism I mentioned earlier. I think Ted Rozak      said many years ago that the deterioration of the      environment is an outward mirror of an inner condition.      Like inside like outside. On the other hand there are some      signs that we recognize this can't go on. Until we have the      physical manifestation of sustainable livelihoods      demonstrated in enough places, we are going to continue the      folly. So the good examples, whether they are the good      examples among organic farmers, or the good examples among      research efforts, or just the good examples of ordinary      right livelihood give us a standard. If we don't have those      examples I think we'll opt for nuclear power as a way of      preventing social upheaval. And we'll do that without      giving a thought to whether or not we can repeal "Murphy's      Law." How many Chernobyl-like accidents can the world      afford? Do we have to have one of the reactors in Chicago      go, and lose Chicago, in order to develop the information      that says "anything is better than this."    </p>        <p>      MEN:    </p>    <p>      Let's contemplate the future for    </p>    <p>      a moment. Your great-grandfather was one of the pioneers      who plowed the Kansas prairie. What kind of Kansas do you      think your great-grandson will see?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I have my first grandchild due in      February. In 2036-100 years after my birth-the      grandchild could be 41. Maybe there will be perennial      polycultures on the eroding lands which represent      seveneigths of the tilled land across our countryside.      Maybe farms will run on contemporary sunlight. Maybe it      will be a world in which cultures everywhere understand      that community is the locus for connecting. Perhaps a major      feature will be a sophisticated form of tribalism, so      culturally rich that flying an airplane or going to a      shopping mall will be boring. Maybe we will have a world      full of music and art and poetry and tinkering.    </p>    <p>      Another possibility is that what's happening now in the      cities-homelessness, drive-by shootings,      drugs-amounts to a faint foreshadowing of the norm.      No wilderness. No opportunity to sit on a grassy bank and      watch a bee at work. No community warmth. Little love,      little affection.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> It's within our reach-ecotopia      on one hand, urban hell on the other?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WJ:</strong> I think we have the potential for both      in us. We have a chance for the first time in human history      to put together an agriculture in which there is no soil      erosion, no chemical contamination of the countryside, no      fossil fuel dependency. A near totally non-extractive      economy is possible in agriculture. That puts us right up      against the buzz saw. Because here is the extractive      economy on one hand and the far, far less extractive      economy on the other.Who is going to support this work? Not      big industry. Who is left? Well, there is government. Even      though government is tied to the corporate sector, the      people still have a chance to say `this is what we want:    </p>    <p>      What is humbling to me, absolutely humbling, is to realize      the choice is in our hands. There will not be any one      individual that leads the pack into a safe and sustainable      future. It will be a <em>culture</em> that decides, and the      grace of God stands ready to assist, provided we honor      Darwin's great evolutionary ecological insight.    </p>
