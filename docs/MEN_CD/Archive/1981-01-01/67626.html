                <p>      From the Canadian magazine <em>Harrowsmith</em> comes this      helpful excerpt on how to sweep your own chimney.    </p>        <p>      Reprinted by permission from Harrowsmith Magazine,      copyrightÂ© 1980          </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Matthew Radz</h5>            <p>      Whether cleaning one's own chimney or relying on the      services of a sweep, the burner of wood should be aware of      what is being removed and why it cannot be allowed to      accumulate in a flue.    </p>    <p>      Creosote is the bane of many contemporary wood heating      systems, and it is produced in quantity by a slow-burning,      smoldering fire . . . the very sort that makes for those 6-      to 16-hour burns of which many stove owners are so proud.    </p>    <p>      Creosote is the name of a specific chemical compound (C 8 H      10 O 2 ), which, in its commercially available form, is      used to weatherproof railroad ties and other wood. It also      occurs in chimneys used to vent wood smoke, but creosote      from a sweep's viewpoint is a complex mixture of wood tar,      soot, and other by-products produced by the burning of      wood.    </p>    <p>      It appears in three primary forms: a thin, watery fluid      that consists of creosote and soot mixed with water which      has condensed in the chimney . . . a dry, black, gray, or      brownish brittle crust found clinging to the inside of the      flue . . . and a tarlike, sticky layer which can seriously      clog a chimney. The sooty fluids and the tarlike layer are      practically impossible to remove before they become      pyrolized. These forms of creosote ignite only at extremely      high temperatures. It is the brittle, pyrolized creosote      which is the potential fuel for a flue fire.    </p>    <p>      Although relatively little research has been done on      creosote formation, it is believed that three main factors      determine the amount that is deposited at a given time or      in a given chimney.    </p>    <p>      [1] Smoke Density. Creosote builds up when thick smoke,      sometimes known as <em>tar fog</em> , condenses on the      walls of a cool flue. Dense smoke occurs when a fire is      oxygen-starved or when green wood is burned.    </p>    <p>      Contrary to the popular notion that seasoned hardwood will      not yield creosote, there is ample evidence to show that      even the driest, hardest of woods can cause problems if      improperly burned. An airtight stove kept constantly in a      tightly dampered state burns wood very slowly, producing      heavy smoke and large amounts of incompletely burned wastes      . . . no matter what fuel is used.    </p>    <p>      [2] Stack Temperature. A cold chimney serves as a      distillation tube for warm tar fog, and a slow-burning fire      is accompanied by lower flue temperatures and a      correspondingly high rate of creosote formation. Other      factors that come into play are the type of chimney and its      location. The newer, insulated metal flues are reported by      many sweeps to be much less prone to creosoting problems,      while masonry chimneys that run up an outside wall are      among the worst. The ideal chimney, in most opinions, is      one which is contained within the house and therefore is      much easier to keep warm.    </p>    <p>      [3] Residence Time. This term refers to the period      necessary for smoke to exit from the stove and chimney. In      a slowburning fire, smoke rises sluggishly up the chimney,      providing increased exposure to the cooling effect of the      flue walls. Bends and elbows in the stovepipe and flue also      serve to increase the residence time by creating turbulence      and swirls of tar fog.    </p>    <p>      One environment in which creosote formation is kept to a      minimum is the typical open fireplace. With an unhampered      flow of air, the wood burns rapidly and completely, with      nearly complete combustion of flammable particles in the      smoke and wood gas. The chimney of such a fireplace should      be checked at least once each year, but cleaning may be      necessary only in alternating years.    </p>    <p>      At the other end of the spectrum we find the efficient      airtight stove, which, if kept in a perpetual slow burn,      may clog a flue with creosote in two weeks or less.    </p>    <h3>SWEEPING BASICS</h3>    <p>      Various folk methods of cleaning chimneys have evolved over      the years, and range from sending the Christmas goose up      the flue prior to beheading it, to pulling a small      evergreen through the pipes. Other techniques involve      drawing a burlap sack filled with sand up (or down) the      flue, or rattling lengths of chain in the chimney to      dislodge creosote and soot deposits (a tactic that may lead      to cracked masonry or flue tiles).    </p>    <p>      None of the above can compare with the      effectiveness-and ease-of using a modern steel      chimney brush. Several slow passes through the chimney with      one of these bristling devices is usually sufficient to      remove virtually all removable creosote.    </p>    <p>      Two types are commonly available, the first being a brush      with eyelets at the top and bottom, designed to be pulled      through the chimney on a rope or ropes. A one-man method      using this type of brush involves hanging a weight from the      lower eyelet and lowering the brush down through the      chimney. This method is occasionally used by professional      sweeps when faced with a restricted access chimney, in      which extension poles cannot be employed.    </p>    <p>      Most sweeps, however, prefer to work with a brush fitted to      the end of a rod. This system allows one to work either      from the rooftop or from inside the house, provided there      is adequate clearance for entry of the rod (the highly      flexible fiberglass lets the extension rod angle rather      sharply into and up a flue).    </p>    <p>      Assuming that the brush is of the correct size for the      chimney being cleaned (an eight-inch flue calls for an      eight-inch metal brush . . . but, if you're using a      flexible plastic brush, it might be wise to use a size      larger than your flue), it is merely worked slowly through      the chimney . . . either from the top down or the bottom      up. As the brush progresses, it should be worked in short,      up-and-down scrubbing strokes, with a pause at the end of      the downward stroke to allow time for loosened debris to      fall. Additional extension rods are screwed on as needed      until the brush emerges from the top of the chimney or      strikes the bottom.    </p>    <p>      The flex in the rods allows the brush to be worked around      most slight angles and jogs in the flue, but in especially      tortuous chimneys a plumber's snake may have to be      employed. Most sweeps recommend steel brushes over the      cheaper plastic versions and, although they generally work      with 0.48-inch-diameter fiberglass rods, the homeowner      should be wellserved with the less expensive 0.35-inch      rods.    </p>    <p>      Brushes-round, square, and rectangular-can be      ordered to fit most chimneys, but if the exact size needed      is not available, the next size larger should be chosen      (one-quarter to one-half inch of excess bristle length will      cause no major problems).    </p>    <p>      Steps should be taken to assure that dislodged creosote,      soot, ash, and dust are kept from entering the house. If an      open fireplace is being cleaned from the top, its damper      should be shut tightly, and if this seems insufficient, a      sheet or a piece of paper can be taped over the mouth of      the fireplace. A closed airtight stove will contain any      clouds of dust, but if the stove has been disconnected for      cleaning, the wall exit should be stuffed with paper to      seal the flue from the interior of the house. (It's also      advisable to wear a piece of cheesecloth-or other      material-over your nose and mouth while working to      reduce the chance of inhaling the carcinogenic dust.)    </p>    <p>      When one is cleaning from inside the house, it is important      that downdrafts be avoided, or loosened soot will be drawn      back into the house. Cleaning on a cool day usually assures      an upward flow of air, but it may be necessary to open a      first-floor window or two to create the proper flow of air.      (To determine the direction of flow, hold a smoking piece      of paper near the opening of the stove, fireplace, or      flue.)    </p>    <p>      Having cleaned out the chimney, one should next shovel up      the fallen creosote and soot, and bag it to go to the dump      (it serves no useful purpose around farm or garden). Using      a flashlight, inspect the chimney to assure that the walls      are now clean. They need not be shining bright or spotless,      but any obvious deposits of creosote should have been      removed. In an especially dirty chimney, the falling      creosote occasionally jams in the flue, creating a thick      block of fallen waste. If you are unable to visually check      the flue, insert a fire poker or other tool to assure      yourself that the chimney is open.    </p>    <p>      To clean the stovepipe connecting a stove to the chimney,      it is often best to take it down and move it outdoors to      avoid creating a mess inside. If the pipe is properly      screwed together at each joint, it may be possible to carry      it out in one piece and to clean it without totally      disassembling the sections. When taking apart any      stovepipe, it is wise to first make a small scratch at each      joint, so that the pieces can be rejoined easily (used      stovepipe sections can stubbornly refuse to be connected in      a new order or alignment). The pipes can be cleaned with a      sweep's brush or with a simple long-handled wire brush      available from hardware stores.    </p>    <p>      For the occasional cleaning of the stove or fireplace      itself, a drop-cloth should be spread to protect      surrounding floor space and any hint of a downdraft      avoided. If the chimney is drawing air briskly, the      inevitable dust that arises will be carried up and out the      flue. Professional chimney sweeps make use of an industrial      vacuum to clean stoves and fireplaces, as well as to filter      dust from the air during the indoor cleaning process. The      average home vacuum should not, however, be used for      cleaning up heavy amounts of ash, as the fine particles can      damage the motor bearings. A wire brush, scraper,      flashlight, ash shovel, and whisk broom make it possible to      do a completely acceptable job of cleaning any stove.      Occasionally a fireplace will have an almost inaccessible      smoke ledge or other space where creosote, ash, and soot      have accumulated, and an industrial vacuum (available at      rental outlets) may have to be employed to complete the      job.    </p>    <h3>HOW OFTEN?</h3>    <p>      The frequency of such cleanings, of course, depends on the      type of stove, the wood being burned, and the habits of      those who use the stove. It is generally recommended that      the chimney and stovepipes be checked after two weeks of      using a new stove. If no serious deposits are found, the      stove can be used for another two to four weeks, and      checked again . . . until the owner has a feeling for how      often a sweeping is necessary. The standard guideline      states that any deposit of creosote more than a quarterinch      thick should be cleaned.    </p>    <p>      The prime place to check is the point where the stovepipe      enters the chimney flue. If the deposits are sticky and      tarlike, the chimney cannot be cleaned without fouling      one's brush. A hot fire should be built to pyrolize the      creosote, turning it into dry flakes which are easily      swept. If a hard, slaglike deposit is found, it is usually      best left alone. It can be chiseled or hammered out, but      only at the risk of damaging the chimney.    </p>    <p>      In the wake of a chimney fire, the flue should be swept and      the entire system checked for the presence of leaks or      cracks. This can be done visually and with a smoke test, in      which a wet blanket or burlap sack is used to seal the top      of the chimney once a small but smoky fire has been built      (burning hay, green leaves, grass clippings, or wet      leaves). One person should be on the roof ready to apply      and remove the wet cloth, and another below to watch the      fire and check for smoke leaking out the chimney. While the      flue is well filled with smoke, someone should inspect its      entire length, looking for telltale wisps of escaping      smoke.    </p>    <p>      If all of this boggles the mind, calling a professional      sweep may be the answer (ignoring the chimney is not). A      good sweep will do more than clean the chimney. He should      be able to tell you whether a stove and chimney are safely      installed and should report on the condition of the      chimney. He should be willing to explain what he's doing      and may provide the would-be chimney sweep with the      confidence needed to do the job himself.    </p>    <p>      To hire a sweep, ask for estimates from several      professionals in the area . . . if they exist. Ask how much      experience the sweep has had, whether he carries insurance      (a good sweep does) and whether he guarantees that the job      will be done without mess. A trail of soot across a rug is      the footprint of a careless and/or incompetent sweep.    </p>    <h3>SWEEP LORE</h3>    <p>      Orrin C. Kerr-a professional parttime sweep-is      bearded, long-haired, and as tall and wide as a lot of      chimneys. "Traditionally the sweep is considered a creature      of good luck," said Kerr, as I watched him work inside a      very handsome Kingston home near Lake Ontario. "In Germany,      custom has it that if you touch the sweep's brushes, good      luck will rub off on you. In England and the Scandinavian      countries, the luck is picked up by shaking the sweep's      hand, or-in the case of ladies-by kissing him .      . . this is the part of the job I like best. Another Olde      English custom is to invite a chimney sweep to the wedding      to kiss the bride and to shake the groom's hand, insuring a      lucky marriage."    </p>    <p>      Not being superstitious, yet at the same time not wishing      to take any unnecessary chances, I held out my hand. We      shook. As I left, Kerr turned his back to return to his      task and there was my opportunity: On the way to the door      -I sneaked a quick feel of the steel bristles . . .      just in case.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Harrowsmith the fine magazine from which      this excerpt was reprinted, comes out eight times a year      and is available from Harrowsmith Magazine, Dept.
