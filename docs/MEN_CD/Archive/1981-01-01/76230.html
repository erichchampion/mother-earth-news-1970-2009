                    <p>      Regular readers of this column know that-every so      often-we "open up" the Economic Outlook space, and      use it to provide a forum from which to present the views      of various economic writers and thinkers. In the past      years, we've so featured the work of Walter Prescott Webb,      C. Vernon Myers, and others. Well, the following      assay-reprinted with permission from Mr. R.E.      McMaster's economic newsletter, The Reaper-struck us      as just the sort of commonsense analysis that MOTHER's      readers would appreciate and profit from. R.E. has, in      relatively few words, cut through much of the mumbo-jumbo      that characterizes the public statements of the economic      "establishment" . . . and revealed the simple, beautiful      truth that any nation's real wealth is based solely upon      the richness of its natural resources and the productivity      of its people.    </p>    <h3>BREAD IS BASIC</h3>    <p>      When we talk about economics these days, the words and      phrases which quickly fill the air are: "supply side      economics", "marginal utility", "Chicago vs Keynesian      economics", "monetary and fiscal policy", "inflation",      "petrodollar recycling", and so forth. All these buzz words      are evidence of the frame of reference from which they      spring, that of urban intellectuals. They are products of a      culturally sophisticated age, marked by mathematical      complexity and computer technology. Collectively,      economists focus on money as an absolute in the      financial/economic system. Money is king, and calls all the      shots. Money is the measure of wealth and worth, both net      and personal. We are dealing here with a mind set that      saturates our society.    </p>    <p>      In a few moments of fleeting fantasy, let's assume that we      are the remnant of a boatload of people. We are shipwrecked      and marooned upon an island in the Pacific. All we have are      the clothes on our backs and the resources of the island,      in terms of economic goods. With no hope of rescue, we      start to build an economy. We begin with the basis of      economic production . .. land and labor. These two must      work in harmony for there to be economic progress and      production. (Notice that there has to be production before      there can be consumption. Our economic order today often      gets the cart before the horse.)    </p>    <p>      Assuming that our island is located in a moderate climate,      receives ample rainfall and sunshine, is blessed with lush      vegetation, trees, fertile valleys, streams, and an      abundance of animals, we have the foundation necessary for      producing economic wealth. Certainly, we should be thankful      that we aren't marooned on a desert island. The resources      available on an arid island wasteland make the production      of economic wealth far more difficult, if not impossible.    </p>    <p>      Next, let us assume that the men and women who were      shipwrecked with us are of strong, hard-working stock. So,      our labor resource is the best possible, too. If we were      marooned with a group of elderly people, or young children,      or sick or lazy individuals, we would quickly learn that      our labor force was marginally productive. So, it becomes      readily apparent that high quality land and labor are the      raw materials of maximum economic productivity, and that      both somewhat depend upon the "luck of the draw". Climate,      natural flora and fauna, water, and minerals are real      environmental assets. Good physical condition, moderate      age, and a positive mental attitude toward work are also      the "luck of the draw" in the case of our shipwrecked      passengers: (This is also true when a new government comes      to power in a nation.)    </p>    <p>      With favorable land and labor, we begin to produce capital      . . . houses, fishing gear, canoes, bows and arrows,      cooking and eating utensils, etc. Notice that land and      labor are the raw materials for the production of capital,      and subsequently, goods and services. What goods will be      produced? The goods most desired. Only if a good or service      is desired, will it have value. It is questionable,      particularly initially, on the island, if gold will be      viewed as being very valuable. Fish, fruits, a horse, a      milk cow, shelter, boats, and bows and arrows will probably      be in the greatest demand initially. These items have      value. Only after our new culture is established will we      then view gold as having value. Then, and only then, will      gold serve, as it has always served, as a medium of      exchange, which holds its value as a store of wealth and is      easily divisible, recognized, and nondestructible. Gold      only become valuable after the basic biological needs of      our group are met.    </p>    <p>      We are lucky enough to establish a gold mine on our island      after the first three years of civilization. Some members      of our work force mine the yellow metal and produce gold      coins. The gold coins have value, because they represent      actual productivity... toil and sweat. Our rice farmer is      willing to trade "x" number of bushels of rice for "x"      number of gold coins, because he recognizes nizes that he      is receiving value for value. Both rice and gold are the      result of productivity. All productivity on our island, all      good and services, stem from the earth. They are made      possible by la. bor. THIS IS ALSO TRUE TODAY IN OUR      SOCIETY. WE JUST FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IT!    </p>    <p>      All goods and services, as well as real money, gold and      silver are the result of work, the expenditure of energy.      Recall the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Energy      is neither created nor destroyed. It is only transferred,      and something is alway lost in the transfer. Economics      operates in harmony with these laws. This is just plain,      good old country economics. It is a far cry from      city-centered, fictional, debt-created wealth.    </p>    <p>      On our island (in the rural country, too) goods, services,      and money are <em>produced into</em> being. The Federal      Reserve, on the other hand, simply creates money out of      thin air. The Fed spend money into circulation. This is      what inflation is all about, the creation of something      (money) out of nothing.    </p>    <p>      Why did we go to all the trouble of creating this fantasy?      Primarily, to reprogram our thinking. We no longer think in      terms of who and what creates true economic prosperity. The      land is the ultimate source of all wealth. The labor of men      produces the wealth which is latent in the land. From this      observation, we should see that when the land is      unfruitful, such as during times of drought, the net result      for the economy at large will be decreasing economic      prosperity, less wealth. This is why drought and      depressions go hand in hand. The land is less productive,      so less wealth is produced, and hard times hit.    </p>    <p>      Since all new wealth comes from the land, it is critical      that we note that farm income is approximately 70% of ail      new raw material income-new wealth. In a very real      sense, then, agricultural production is a governing factor      in our economy. The $20 billion agricultural loss in 1980,      due to drought, will be devastating for the economy,      long-term.    </p>    <p>      Carl H. Wilken, an American farm economist, proved that a      definite link exists between the value of farm products and      national income. Wilken's evidence suggested that the new      wealth created ad in the economy multiplied itself seven      times, as it worked its way through the economy. Put      simply, $1.00 of farm income generates $7.00 of other      income. Also, a 1% increase in unemployment results from a      1% drop in farm income, according to Wilken's studies.      Wilken stated that the only factor that remains consistent      with the earned profits and savings of a nation as a whole      is the total price paid for all our raw material production      Agriculture, while the largest source of new wealth, is      joined by oil production, ore recovery, timber harvested,      etc. These re sources, most of which are renewable, produce      new wealth.    </p>    <p>      It's also important to note that what we are dealing with      here is the multiplier effect. When the price of raw      materials drops, there is an exact ratio decline in terms      of national income. And an increase in debt expansion and      unemployment, according to Wilken. Economic good times are,      by contrast, multiplied by abundant production of new      wealth. Economic bad times are magnified by declining raw      material production. Again, Wilken purported that the total      national income is five to seven times the annual price      paid for all raw material production. This "parity", if you      will, ties real money !n directly with the production of      other goods and services.    </p>    <p>      Tractors have to be produced. Gold has to be produced.      Wheat has to be produced. Thus, equipment, money, and food      are all produced by the sweat of men's brows. Wheat and      tractors can not be created out of nothing. Neither should      money. When money is earned into circulation rather than      created out of thin air and spent into circulation, not      only does inflation not exist, but, with the concomitant      elimination of the fractional reserve banking system, the      boom/bust cycle is eliminated, too. Remember that a cycle      is, by its very nature, unstable. Men desire stability, for      with it comes a sense of security, well-being, and a      long-term view. Eliminating the interest earned by the      banks which own the Federal Reserve on money which is      created out of thin air, plus outlawing the fractional      reserve banking system, would go a long way toward      providing us with a sound, stable, and secure economy.      True, our economy would not grow as fast, but growth would      come in real terms, not in terms of illusionary,      debt-created wealth that is liquidated in the bust which      follows the inflationary boom.    </p>    <p>      With all this in mind, let's look at a study entitled, "The      Implications of an International Gold Based Economic System      to Raw Materials Prices", prepared by Peter L. Brandt and      Daniel Markey at the Chicago Board of Trade (9/7/79). They      looked at the relationship between gold and other raw      materials (commodities). (By the way, what we have been      discussing above in terms of real economic exchange is      nothing more or less than "barter".)    </p>    <p>      Brandt and Markey stated, "While all raw material prices      will continue to be traded in currency terms, the currency      expression of that raw material's value will be in      relationship to gold and silver over the long term." Brandt      and Markey were relating to economic reality (barter) in a      society that thinks in terms of computerized banking      illusion.    </p>    <p>      Based upon $350 gold, it was these gentlemen's conclusion      that the price of corn should be $4.65 a bushel, wheat      $7.00, soybeans $11.65, oats $2.48, cotton $1.03 per pound,      hogs $.65, pork bellies $.81, cattle $1.13, broilers $.67,      cocoa $1.94, sugar $.16, and copper $1.52, production      shortfalls aside.    </p>    <p>      Let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that Brandt      and Markey's analysis is roughly accurate. What conclusions      can we draw with relative confidence? First of all, with      gold having doubled their $350 price, other commodities      should be much higher priced, too. Yet, with gold now at      roughly twice the price discussed in this study, we still      find that these basic commodities, taken collectively, have      not moved up substantially, at all. In fact, these basic      commodities are, for the most part, still selling for less      than they should have when gold was at $350 an ounce!    </p>    <p>      What's wrong? . . . There is a political/fear/anxiety      factor built into the price of gold, which distorts its      relationship to other commodities. Gold is real money, and      the stampede to gold and the distortion of the ratios is,      in fact, evidence of an invisible depression. During a      depression, people seek money, real money, which is,      historically, gold. Commodities are cheap in a depression,      and we have been through an inflationary depression in      terms of gold versus commodities.    </p>    <p>      This warped gold/commodity relationship also suggests that      eventually the price of commodities may have, long-term, a      lot higher to go, particularly if the price of gold      maintains its present lofty levels.    </p>    <p>      But, there is yet another more insidious conclusion that we      can draw. In terms of real money, gold, the prices of raw      materials have deflated drastically. If they stay low in      terms of gold, or if the price of gold declines and these      raw material prices hold steady or decline further, the      implications should be obvious for the economy at large. We      will have a tremendous shakeout. Recall Wilken's      conclusions.    </p>    <p>      The wide difference now between the annual price paid for      raw material production and national income is due to the      use of credit/debt: $1.00 of farm income generates $7.00 of      national income. In terms of economic expansion and      contraction, this means that the economy at large has some      massive adjusting to do on the downside if commodity prices      stay put, or fall.    </p>    <p>      If commodity prices rise sharply, and realign with gold,      the cost of basics for the American consumer will send the      Misery Index through the roof. As we discussed in the      earlier paragraphs of this article, commodities are the      real anchor, the reality to which all economic activity      ultimately returns. Bread is basic.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The Reaper (a typical issue contains eight      full pages of detailed economic analysis and prediction) is      published 47 times each year.
