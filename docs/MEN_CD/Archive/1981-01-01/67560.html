            		<p>      Cut people's taxes . . . beautify the land . . . recycle .      . . and earn $500+ a week with . . .</p>         <h5 id="byline">       By Henry Bolduc    </h5>                    <p>      Six years ago-quite by accident-my lady and I      started a profitable home business in New England . . . an      enterprise we still enjoy today. At the time, we found the      beautiful barn-board interiors of some of our neighbors'      houses so attractive that-when it was time to remodel      our own kitchen's cracking plaster walls-we felt sure      the warm coziness of weathered planks would provide a      perfect background for our antiques and cast-iron pots and      pans.    </p>    <p>      We soon discovered, however, that real barn board was      impossible to buy at any price. (Some building supply      companies offered simulated barn board and plastic beams,      but such "forgeries" just weren't what we'd envisioned.)    </p>    <p>      So, fortunately (as it turned out), we were finally forced      to tear down an old barn ourselves. And ever since that      first experience, our company-Adventures in      Time-has located decrepit old barns and sheds, and      recycled their valuable aged boards and hand-hewn beams.      The task is not only our business ... it's one of the joys      in our lives!    </p>    <h3>FREE BARNS FOR THE FINDING</h3>    <p>      It's not as difficult as you might think to track down the      income-producing "derelict" buildings. First, <em>ask</em>      everyone you know for suggestions .. . and then drive      around rural areas and <em>look</em> for fallen or      abandoned structures. (Sheds are easier to dismantle than      barns but, obviously, yield less wood. And while barns      generally produce the <em>best</em> antique lumber, don't      overlook the weathered boards that can be found in old      tenant houses, corrals, cattle chutes, fences, and      windmills.)    </p>    <p>      Once you discover a structure that looks promising, locate      the owner and inquire whether he or she would like you to      tear down and haul away the hazard. (After all, you'll be      performing a public service .. . not only by promoting      recycling and beautifying the landscape, but also by      eliminating a potential fire or accident "trap".)    </p>    <p>      When you negotiate for the right to tear a building down,      remember to appear professional and not <em>too</em>      anxious. <em>Don't</em> drool over the 28-inch-wide floor      boards, or caress the open beams, or fondle the hand-forged      iron latch and hinges. Just remind the owners that (as is      the case in most states) they're probably paying taxes on      the pile of rubble . . . ask them to visualize how much      nicer their land will look when the eyesore is gone . . .      and spell out clearly that you'll do the job <em>free</em>      , in return for the wood.    </p>    <p>      By that time, most people will be begging you to "smash      down that mess and haul the junk away". And, even if a few      prospects refuse your services, be comforted by the      knowledge that the countryside is <em>filled with</em>      falling structures.    </p>    <p>      Also, don't forget to state <em>specifically</em> that      you'll clean up any debris afterward. This part of your job      should include raking the site clean and burning (check to      see whether a burning permit is required) or hauling away      all unsalvageable leftovers. Be sure to <em>keep</em> your      promise on such cleanup operations, too, because a good      word-of-mouth reputation will all but guarantee that you'll      be invited to salvage more barns and sheds later on . . .      and is a better and less expensive "business finder" than      are newspaper ads.    </p>                <p>      <em>Don't</em> underestimate, however, the pulling power of      low-cost classified blurbs in your local paper or      "shopper". Our first such solicitation found us one of the      free barns shown in the accompanying photos, and the      "extras" <em>that</em> job brought were amazing: We were      able to salvage kegs of cut nails and numerous pulleys,      windows, granite blocks, bricks, etc. In fact, surprise      bonuses-including fencing, wire, rare old bottles, and      other antiques- <em>often</em> turn up in your      "take"... as, of course, do ample supplies of free kindling      and firewood.    </p>    <p>      Before you do any work, though, <em>write out</em> two      copies of a contract (or informal agreement) giving you      possession of "the barn and everything in it", so no      misunderstandings occur later on. A country handshake may      be enough in many areas, but a signed note provides better      protection. (Most folks will also want to include in the      contract a statement that you won't hold them responsible      for any injuries that occur on their property.)    </p>    <p>      <em>After</em> the agreement is signed, you may go and      lavish all the affection you like on "your" barn or shed.    </p>    <h3>DO IT TO IT</h3>    <p>      In the good old days, country folks held barn-raising      parties. Now, entrepreneurs who deal in barn wood often get      groups of friends together and have <em>demolition par</em>      ties. Basically-once you've rounded up your      help-the work requires only hammers and wrecking      bars. (We've discovered that a "pinch bar"-along      wrecking bar with a U-shaped, claw-hammer end-is very      efficient.) A chain saw is optional: Don't subject a      valuable new saw to the abuse involved in tearing down      buildings . . . but if you have an old <em>used</em> one,      you'll find that you can slice right through ancient nails      and beams, making many jobs quicker and easier.    </p>    <p>      For safety's sake, it's wise to wear sturdy overalls . . .      heavy, steel-toed boots to protect your feet from nail      punctures (be sure your tetanus shot is valid) ... and good      work gloves to guard against splinters, cuts, and other      injuries. On some jobs a hard hat is advisable, too.      And-while working-you should <em>always</em> be      on the lookout for wasps and other vermin.    </p>    <p>      When demolition time comes, each person will probably      develop his or her own special approach. Often, a building      will be in such a state of disrepair that a "huff and puff"      will blow it down. For solidly standing structures,      however, you might want to use a "reverse carpentry"      technique, taking the edifice apart in an order opposite to      that in which it was put up.    </p>    <p>      In such a case, you'll probably begin by removing all loose      materials, taking out the windows, and dismantling floors      and moldings. Next, tackle any interior walls ... the roof      covering (which usually isn't worth saving) . .. and the      horizontal roof boards. Then remove the roof "skeleton",      piece by piece (leaving only the structural beams that hold      the building together), and pry off the exterior walls.      Once the ceiling headers are gone, the wall joists can be      pushed out, and-finally-the subfloor      demolished.    </p>    <p>      Frankly, we seldom go to that much trouble. We've found we      can salvage almost the same amount of wood if we simply cut      the main beams with a chain saw and push the structure over      or-in the case of a large barn or shed-      <em>pull</em> it down, using a cable or rope hooked to a      tractor. The "quick and dirty" method not only saves a      tremendous amount of time on the job, but also avoids the      necessity of working in high places and on possibly rotted      roofs. (It's better to suffer a few broken boards than a      broken bone!)    </p>    <p>      If you use a little common sense, you won't have to worry      about having the building collapse around you when the main      beams are cut. Most old structures are pretty solidly      built, and you'll find thateven with the main beams      removed-they're not likely to fall down without a      little "arguing". In fact, we think the cutand-collapse      approach is the safest way to deal with dangerously big      buildings.    </p>    <p>      With the whole structure down and its components all well      within reach, it's time to be gentle with the worn,      weathered wood. Lovingly extract each nail . . . reverently      unpeg every joint . . . delicately lower each beam ... and      stack everything neatly.    </p>    <p>      When you're finished-and the area is      clean-borrow or rent a van, pickup, or trailer      (assuming you don't have one of your own) to move the      precious woodpile. (Or you might be able to get permission      to sell the barn wood at the site, and let the buyers haul      it away.)    </p>    <h3>THE FINANCIAL REWARDS</h3>    <p>      Once you learn how to estimate the value of a salvage      operation, you'll begin to realize what a treasure each      structure can be . . . because the old, weathered wood      sells for <em>much</em> more than new lumber. Ours goes      (quickly!) for $2.00 to $4.00 per foot, with hand-hewn      beams selling at $10 per foot and more! (On one barn alone,      we made a profit of over $2,000, while <em>keeping</em>      enough wood to finish off two kitchens, four big rooms, and      a large hallway . . . and give us free fuel for two years!)    </p>    <p>      Generally speaking, the <em>smaller</em> the lot of wood      being sold, the <em>higher the</em> price you can charge      per foot . . . whereas on a big order you should offer a      "wholesale" deal. Yet because time (when you could be out      demolishing <em>another old</em> structure) is money,      you'll usually clear more cash-and avoid the nuisance      buyer who will search for hours for the "right" boards to      build a bookcase-if you sell your wood in one or two      big lots rather than in a dozen small ones.    </p>    <p>      In our experience, an average income (after all expenses)      of $500 per work week    </p>    <p>      Is about the least you should expect. The prices you charge      for your lumber (and the wages you pay your help) will, of      course, vary . . . but most hard-working barn-board      salvagers can make much more than that minimum amount.    </p>    <p>      When starting out, pay your workers (if they agree) in wood      rather than cash. Then-as we first did-market      your excess lumber <em>after</em> you've used the best for      your own home. A small ad that offers "authentic barn board      and hand-hewn beams" brings in all the customers we need.      Or, if you store your product in an area of fairly high      traffic, you won't even have to advertise . . . people will      constantly be stopping to ask if you'd like to sell "that      old lumber".    </p>    <h3>EXPAND THE BUSINESS</h3>    <p>      In addition to <em>peddling</em> the scavenged product, you      can-if you have at least modest woodworking      abilities-expand your business by installing the      boards. You need no special carpentry skills to create      beautiful rooms with this antique lumber, because the      beauty of such paneling is in its simplicity, and fancy      work isn't necessary.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, many professional carpenters don't      <em>like</em> to work with used lumber, as hidden nails can      damage their expensive equipment. We, on the other hand,      use old power tools or-more often, since the aged      wood is very easy to cut and work with-hand tools      that we've picked up at flea markets and yard sales . . .      and you can do the same! (Generally speaking, a hammer,      saw, marking gauge, and square are the only tools necessary      for installing barn wood.)    </p>    <p>      You'll find some folks who assume that a room paneled with      weathered boards will have-or will      attract-bugs. But we know of <em>many</em> such rooms      all around the country, and we've never heard of any      unusual insect problem. Of course, common sense, in the      form of giving your boards a careful inspection, should      prevail. We check out every building for possible problems      before we strike an agreement with the owner. Termites and      other wood borers will leave little piles of sawdust to      announce their presence (see "Where's Your Wood", on page      186 of MOTHER NO. 66, for information on how to spot such      pests), and we simply won't deal with any structure that      shows signs of insect infestation.    </p>    <p>      Usually, however, you'll find that the sun and wind have      taken care of bug problems for you. Dry timber is safe      against most forms of decay and deterioration, and even      woodworms and fungi will rarely attack wood with a moisture      content below 12%.    </p>    <p>      The main thing you have to watch out for is dry rot, a      fungous decay that causes seasoned timber to become brittle      and crumble to powder. This disease will usually be limited      to boards that have come in contact with ground moisture,      and such wood must be discarded. (A very conservative rule      states that you should cut away an affected board <em>at      least 18</em> <em>inches beyond</em> any signs of decay.)      Luckily, most old-time barn carpenters seem to have kept      the dry rot problem in mind when they constructed their      outbuildings.    </p>    <p>      We usually wire-brush our wood before using it . . . or      wash it down with a garden hose at full pressure and then      let it dry thoroughly in the sun. If your boards are      unusually dirty-or if you want immaculate      lumber-scrub with a wire brush as you wash.    </p>    <p>      And, though it's not really necessary, you can preserve and      bring out the luster of the beautiful old boards with a      half-and-half mixture of boiled linseed oil and turpentine.      It will sink right into the wood and-we      think-has a very pleasant smell. (Such a treatment is      particularly attractive when the lumber has remnants of an      old paint job still on it.)    </p>    <h3>EXPERIMENT AT HOME</h3>    <p>      The best way to acquire "decorating" skill is to practice      on your own abode. Each room is different, of course, and      every person will have his or her own preference . . . but      we usually nail our boards up vertically. Horizontal and      diagonal alignments can, however, also produce interesting      effects.    </p>    <p>      When doing a big room, we generally try to cover the entire      wall-and sometimes even the ceiling-with barn      wood. However, in smaller areas the paneling usually looks      better when it's run to only three or four feet above the      floor . . . and finished off, perhaps, with a matching      shelf. To make molding or edging from aged wood, rip the      boards into three-inch-wide strips. (If the original wall      should show through where two pieces don't quite butt up      snugly, solve the problem by spraying a strip of flat black      paint on the area where you'll join two sections of      molding.) "Antiques" nails-or the ones you've      salvaged-can be used to give a room a      <em>totally</em> rustic look.    </p>    <p>      To complete your masterpiece, build shelves and hang up old      baskets, tools, farm implements, Indian rugs, and dried      herbs. Be as imaginative or as conventional as you like . .      . you'll discover that practically any decorating scheme      you choose will look lovely with barn wood!    </p>    <p>      Then, once you've got some "homework" under your belt, you      can confidently set out to spruce up the interiors of      <em>other</em> folks' houses . . . or of such commercial      establishments as beauty salons, taverns, "western"      sections of department stores, and other places that want      an "antique" interior.    </p>    <p>      Since it's difficult to find carpenters willing to work      with this old wood, you should have no problem getting any      reasonable asking price for your labor. For example, a      friend-using all hand tools-recently spent four      days installing a barn-wood wainscot in a small kitchen.      Aside from the $400 received for the wood itself, he      charged $550 for his installation work . . . and the      customer was well-pleased with the job <em>and</em> the      price.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the aged lumber can be used for projects other      than interior decoration, too. We've made signs, fireplace      mantels, shelves, picture and mirror frames, and borders      for stained glass windows. One young couple-who      helped us salvage a collapsed shed-even produced an      elegant home-on-wheels . . . by paneling the entire inside      of a transcontinental bus.    </p>    <p>      And today (years after our first hesitant undertaking), our      own original barn-board rooms-which require      <em>no</em> maintenance-are doing fine . . . and we      have an established recycling business that keeps on      booming!    </p>
