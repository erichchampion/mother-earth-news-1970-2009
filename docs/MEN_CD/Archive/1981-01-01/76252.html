                <p>      <strong>Ecoscience</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Anne and Paul Ehrlich    </h5>        <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population", "resources"; and "environment" in      the late 1960's. (They also coined the term co-evolution,      and did a lot to make ecology the household word it is      today.) But while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs'      popular writing in the areas of ecology and overpopulation      (most of us for instancehave read Paul's book The      Population Bomb) . . . far too few people have any idea of      how, deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological      research (research of the type that tends to be published      only in technical journals and college textbooks). That's      why it pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.    </p>        <p>      If you accept the ecologists' view of the "energy      crisis"-that the heart of the problem, at least in      overdeveloped countries, is too <em>much use,</em> rather      than <em>too little</em> supply-the framework of the      debate concerning our possible future power sources changes      fundamentally. Its focus is no longer on how to get rapid      short-term increases in supply and long-term superabundance      . . . but, instead, on how to achieve rapid short-term      reductions in demand and a long-term sufficient sup      <em>ply, with</em> a minimum of destructive ecological and      social side effects.    </p>    <p>      Even those who take the "too little" view of the energy      situation are beginning to realize that conservation, which      dampens demand, is the only feasible solution in the      <em>very</em> short term. The fact is, you see, that even      the most dramatic possible commitments to more nuclear      power plants, synfuels (coal gasification and liquefaction,      fuels from oil shales and tar sands), solar power, or what      have you will produce little impact on energy supplies for      a decade or more.    </p>    <p>      The need to conserve in the near future is, then, more or      less agreed upon. But such necessity is seen as a      <em>permanent</em> feature of our energy economy by those      with the ecological view. The long-term commitment to      conservation is <em>not</em> espoused, of course, by the      "too little" crowd. For example, Roy Meader has written in      <em>Future Energy Alternatives</em> (Ann Arbor Science      Publishers, 1979): "When fusion energy becomes available,      as the experts confidently expect, it may come suddenly      like a blinding flash of light and inspire a worldwide      religious revival, singing in the streets, and a veritable      orgy of turning on all lights and air conditioners and      letting them run till dawn."    </p>    <p>      But divergent as the different points of view are, we      believe that both schools of thought would concur on      another point: <em>Whatever</em> energy is mobilized for      society-everything else being equal-it should      be mobilized in a manner that is least disruptive socially,      as well as environmentally.    </p>    <h3>SAFETY IN DECENTRALIZATION</h3>    <p>      From our previous column ("Energy: There Ain't No Free      Lunch", MOTHER NO. 66, page 142), you can see that the      renewables-which are primarily various forms of solar      energy-appear to be the most benign alternatives,      from the standpoint of the health of both human beings and      ecosystems. Fusion might be equally (or more) benign, but      this cannot be judged at the present time.    </p>    <p>      One significant advantage of a variety of renewable power      sources is that of decentralization. Today's major energy      technologies tend to be highly centralized, and thus      subject to control or disruption by actions taken at "key"      points . . . from nuclear power plants to the oil tanker      routes through the Straits of Hormuz. An accident or      terrorist action at any such central locale could result in      inconvenience, danger, or injury to many people over vast      areas.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, home solar water heaters and farm      biomass systems are so widely dispersed that no accident or      terrorist action is likely to inconvenience or threaten      great numbers of people. No special "solar police force" is      likely to be required to guard rooftop solar collectors,      or-for that matter-square miles of similar      units making up solar electric power plants. But Britain      already has an extraordinary Nuclear Police Force, and      such' a potentially freedom-threatening organization is      thought by many in the United States to be a necessary      price to pay for the "benefits" of nuclear power, (See "The      Threat of Nuclear Proliferation", MOTHER NO. 65, page 142.      )    </p>    <p>      Another enormous advantage in the use of decentralized      renewables comes in the area of risk/benefit analysis. As      should be evident from our previous columns on energy      matters, the costs of different energy technologies are      difficult to assess.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, such results are often hard to predict: Is,      for instance, a fossil-fuel-CO 2 /climate-induced famine      that kills a billion people more likely to hap pen than a      nuclear-power/terrorist-induced atomic war that kills the      same number?    </p>    <p>      For another thing, even where costs <em>can</em> be      predicted with certainty, it's often extremely difficult to      quantify or compare them. For example, while it's possible      to say that acid rains are a serious threat to ecosystems,      a <em>quantitative</em> assessment of their overall impact      is impossible today and may well remain so permanently, And      how is one to compare such ecosystem impact with, say, the      risk of deaths, cancers, and mutations in the human      population from a possible nuclear reactor meltdown? The      apples vs. oranges problem pervades the assessment of      costs-both realized and potential-of all energy      technologies.    </p>    <p>      Indeed, the complexities of risk analysis are such that,      even when it's done properly-which is certainly not      always the case (see our discussion of "The Inhaber Report"      in MOTHER NOS. 58 and 59)-the results will, at best,      merely provide rough guidelines rather than sharp      distinctions.    </p>    <h3>WHO PAYS?</h3>    <p>      A major complication, which physicist John Holdren has      often pointed out, is that very often the benefits of an      energy technology tend to be reaped by one group, while a      large fraction of the costs are borne by other people      distant in space or time.    </p>    <p>      Often, the rich power-users live in the clean air upwind      from the utility plant, while the poor-whose      per-capita energy use is lower-live in the smog      downwind. And, as is well known, the lives of native      Americans in the Southwest and ranchers in Montana are      disrupted by the mining of coal, which primarily benefits      people on the coasts . . . hardly an equitable arrangement.    </p>    <p>      Should a climate change be brought on by <em>C0 2</em> in      the atmosphere, generated primarily in the rich countries,      the worst of the ensuing famines would almost certainly      occur in poor nations. The mutations resulting from      exposure to radioactivity and mutagenic chemicals released      by power plants will cause health problems for centuries to      come... and a thousand generations of descendants of those      who use electricity generated in nuclear power plants may      have to be concerned about the plutoniumlaced waste that      has been produced by such installations.    </p>    <p>      Holdren, one of the top experts in the field of energy risk      analysis, has developed a twopronged approach for dealing      with these problems.    </p>    <p>      First, society should try to select energy options that      allow the most significant external costs (like pollution)      to be "internalized" by conventional means. For example; if      the principal social and environmental impacts of a certain      energy facility can be-and are-largely      ameliorated by an expenditure of money, the costs will be      "internal" to the bookkeeping of the utility company and      therefore paid by the users of the power.    </p>    <p>      The second approach is set forth in <em>Holdren's      Principle</em> : Energy options should be selected that      tend to deposit on the same people who reap the benefits      any costs that cannot be internalized monetarily. In other      words, those who choose and use a particular energy      technology should, as far as possible, pay the external as      well as internal costs.    </p>    <p>      This would, of course, help solve the problem of "how much      is enough". After all, if electricity is flowing to your      house and the smoke from the generating plant floats into      someone else's, you may demand more and more energy . . .      until the other person chokes or is buried in soot. But if      you receive both the electrici <em>ty and</em> the      pollution,, you're likely to become a conservationist at a      much earlier stage in the game . . . since you can then      subjectively measure the pleasures of high-energy living      against the physical discomfort of choking and dealing with      filth, as well as the mental anguish resulting from the      specter of future cancers.    </p>    <p>      It's clear, even with the imperfect sort of risk analysis      now possible, that decentralized renewable energy      technologies are the most desirable under Holdren's      Principle. More than any others, they place their      environmental and social burdens on those who benefit from      the energy produced.    </p>    <h3>ROOM FOR MISTAKES</h3>    <p>      Reasoning similar to that presented in this column (and in      our last one) has led energy expert Amory Lovins to urge      strongly that society choose what he has labeled a, "soft      energy path"-based primarily on decentralized      renewables-for future energy development... a path      that has room for many technologies. Lovins has concluded      that there's already a large enough highly centralized,      capital-intensive energymobilizing system in place, and      that attempting to meet society's future needs with more of      the same would be a serious error. The soft path, however,      departs from-and is rooted in-a <em>"hard</em>      base.    </p>    <p>      There's been a great deal of debate regarding the      feasibility of Lovins' path. "Hard technology buffs"      (especially nuclear power advocates) tend to claim that not      "enough" energy will become available from decentralized      renewables . . . whereas ample supplies <em>can</em> be      provided by the "proven" technology of nuclear fission.    </p>    <p>      We believe that there's a simple way to resolve this      argument. With reasonable conservation measures, more than      enough fossil fuels are available to maintain industrial      society for 50 years . . . although a great deal of money      will have to be spent on developing the most efficient ways      to use them so that environmental impacts are minimized.      Without conservation and care, dependence on fossil fuels      could be a recipe for disaster.    </p>    <p>      <em>With</em> conservation and care, though, the continued      use of fossil fuels can be a bridge to the future. At the      same time, we can give careful attention to the most      promising of the new technologies rather than engaging in      crash programs that may turn out badly.    </p>    <p>      In short, the next two decades can be spent following      Holdren's principle and exploring Lovins' path.    </p>    <p>      By the year 2000, the question of feasibility for many, if      not most, of these new technologies should be answered. If      <em>all</em> the decentralized renewables prove      impractical, there will still be time to deploy an      appropriate mix of hard technologies. And, by that time,      it's possible that many of the technical problems (if not      the social ones) associated with centralized solar power      generation, synfuels, and/or both fission and fusion will      have been solved.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if the hard path is taken now, there may      never be a return to a soft one: It's very possible that      the capital requirements of, say, going fully nuclear would      so tax the world economy that another full-scale      alternative <em>could</em> <em>not</em> be attempted if the      nuclear route were later perceived to be a disastrous      error. And some of the possible side effects of the hard      path-notably climate modification and world war-might be      irreversible.    </p>    <p>      The "soft path" strategy will-at the very least-leave      our options open, The "hard" route might well foreclose      them... and could be an extremely expensive road to a dead      end.    </p>    <p>      ,The key article by Lovins is "Energy Strategy: The Road      Not Taken" (Foreign Affairs, October 1976). Debates by      Lovins and those advocating the "hard path" can be found in      The Energy Controversy: Soft Path Questions and A nswers,      Hugh Nash, editor (Friends of the Earth, 1979). Holdren's      Principle was formally enunciated in his "Observations for      the California Energy Futures Conference" (Sacramento, May      20, 1978).    </p>    <p>      Back issues of MOTHER containing the articles mentioned      here are available-for $3.00 each plus $1.00 shipping      and handling per order from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted);      P.O. :Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791.    </p>
