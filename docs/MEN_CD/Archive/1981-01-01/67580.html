                <p>      Try your hand at making this truly natural, sugarless      treat!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Laurent E. Beaucage    </h5>            <p>      Ninety years ago, a person could walk into almost any      general store in America, plop down a penny or two, and      pick up a trim little package of spruce chewing gum. There      was even a choice of brands, such as Kennebec, Yankee,      200Lump, and American Flag . . . to name just a few. People      were accustomed to the spruce gum's unsweetened, woodsy      taste, and their demand for it supported a thriving      industry boasting nationwide distribution.    </p>    <p>      But then came the "modern" chews-which were softer,      sweeter, and less expensive to manufacture-and they      soon took over the market. By 1910 the spruce gum industry      had been reduced to little more than a few "kitchen stove"      operations with very small outputs and only scattered      distribution . . . and so it remains to this day.    </p>    <h3>FIND IT!</h3>    <p>      The limited availability of the prepared product need not      stand in the way, however, of your spruce gum enjoyment,      since it's actually quite easy to make your own! Moreover,      the black spruce tree <em>(Picea mariana),</em> the      <em>source</em> of raw spruce gum, has a large enough range      to make it available to most Americans . . . who'll either      <em>live</em> within the tree's native area or encounter      the evergreen while on their travels.    </p>    <p>      You'll find this conifer in Alaska, much of Canada, New      England, central Pennsylvania, western New York, the coast      of New Jersey, western Maryland, central Wisconsin,      northeast Minnesota, the south peninsula of Michigan,      and-sporadically-along the Appalachians as far      south as North Carolina.    </p>    <p>      For the details about more specific locations, write to the      Forestry Department's Information and Education Division in      the capital city of the state you're interested in. The      directions you'll receive in response to your query,      combined with a good field guide to trees, should be all      you'll need to put yourself right in the middle of a stand      of spruce!    </p>    <h3>HARVEST IT!</h3>    <p>      To collect the raw gum, examine the trunk of a black spruce      for breaks or scars in the bark. That's where the pitch      oozes out and-over a long period of      time-solidifies into the hard chunks of resin you're      after!    </p>    <p>      Natural causes for bark ruptures and scars include fire,      lightning, frost, wind, and wildlife damage. Man-made marks      can result from tree-harvesting activities, snowplow      injuries, and "recreational" damage caused by the traffic      around camping facilities and boat launching ramps.    </p>    <p>      Even though nineteenth-century lore insists that      amber-colored raw gum is the best, I make no such      distinction. Instead, I scrape off <em>all</em> the solid      resin (the soft kind is unacceptable) that I can reach with      my putty knife-whether it's yellow, brown, cream, or      pink-since it all looks the same after processing.    </p>    <p>      In the course of a typical two-hour outing, I can usually      collect over one pound of the raw gum. This yields enough      of the finished chewy treat to last me well over a year!    </p>    <h3>PROCESS IT!</h3>    <p>      The processing of your raw spruce product (which is done in      two stages) will accomplish only one thing: It cleans the      raw gum of bits of wood, bark, dirt, and other impurities.    </p>    <p>      First of all, dump your foraged forest product onto a large      square of cloth spread out on any hard, flat surface. Then,      using a mallet, smash the resin repeatedly until it's      reduced to a sandlike consistency. Hard raw gum will      pulverize easily . . . but bits of wood or bark won't, so      these impurities can be easily spotted and removed by hand.    </p>    <p>      During the second step, you'll melt and strain the      material, but-before doing so-you must prepare      a cooling pan for later use. I find that a 2"-deep, 5" X 7"      bread pan is ideal, although any shallow metal container      will do. I simply tape one end of a long, 7"-wide strip of      cheesecloth or cotton muslin to the pan's outside bottom      ... wrap the cloth up and around the container four or five      times, making sure most of the pan's opening is covered on      each pass . . . and then securely tape down the other end      of the strip. Later, when the melted gum is poured into the      container, the cloth acts as a strainer.    </p>    <p>      With the cooling pan ready, you can melt the gum. You'll      need a small pot . . . preferably one you can spare, since      it will be somewhat difficult to clean <em>after</em> the      operation. Put in an inch of the pulverized spruce      drippings . . . add enough fresh water to make a soupy mix      . . . then set the utensil on a slow fire. As the water      comes to a boil, the gum will begin to melt and float on      top. When continued heating has liquefied all the resin      particles, remove the pot and quickly pour its contents      into the cooling pan.    </p>    <p>      Melted spruce gum is a very sticky substance, so expect to      lose up to 25% of what you started out with. Some will      adhere to the cloth strainer, and-since it contains      impurities-must be thrown out with the cloth. Even      more will stick to the inside of the pot . . . but this can      be left, as it will remelt and become part of the      <em>next</em> batch you process.    </p>    <p>      After the spruce soup cools and solidifies (it'll take      about 30 minutes), remove the cloth and pour off the water.      You'll find a sheet of gum on the pan's bottom. A sharp rap      with any blunt instrument will crack this out. Then, to      finish the job, simply break up the resulting large chunks      into bite-sized pieces . . . dust them with cornstarch to      keep them from sticking together . . . and store the      natural confection in a cool, dry place.    </p>    <h3>CHEW IT!</h3>    <p>      If you've never chewed spruce gum before, be patient. It's      very brittle and-at the first bite-will      crumble. Therefore, you must hold it in your mouth for 30      seconds or so and keep masticating. Soon, it will soften      into a nice, pink gum that's as chewable as any on the      market today.    </p>    <p>      And the taste? Here again, the novice must be patient.      Remember, the resin is unsweetened and comes straight from      the tree, so it might seem a little harsh at first. If,      however, you think pleasant thoughts of forest sights,      sounds, and smells while you chew, you'll soon discover the      subtle charm of this natural treat. And once you become      accustomed to the "sprucy" taste, no store-bought gum will      do!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If you need a good guidebook to aid you in      your spruce-hunting endeavors, you'd be hard-pressed to      find a better volume than, The Audubon Society Field Guide      To North American Trees (Eastern Region). It's available at      most good bookstores and many libraries, or-for $9.95      plus 95 cents shipping and handling from-Mother's      Bookshelf, P. O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28791.    </p>
