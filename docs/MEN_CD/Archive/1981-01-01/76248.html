                    <p>      WIND FOR WATER? Wind energy could easily replace more than      half of the fossil fuels currently used to power irrigation      systems on the Great Plains. A USDA study estimates that      wind turbines would be capable of supplying between 60 and      70 percent of the energy used in the farmbelt for surface      irrigation purposes, and replacing 30 to 45 percent of the      nonrenewable resources used for sprinkler irrigation . . .      accounting, as it did so, for an annual energy saving of 18      billion kilowatt-hours.<br />      <br />      PEAT POWER PLANTS: Chicago's Institute of Gas Technology      has begun operating a plant that converts peat into methane      (which is the major component of natural gas). The U.S. has      the world's second largest reserve of the decomposed plant      product, a supply that's estimated to be equivalent to 240      billion barrels of oil or about 10 times the proven      American oil reserves.<br />      <br />      A TRAVELING 2 X 4? An Indiana firm has manufactured a kit      to convert 1/2-, 3/4-, and 1-ton Ford, Chevrolet, and Dodge      "full-time" four-wheel-drive pickups to optional two-wheel      drive. The kit is said to improve gas mileage by as much as      30%, extend tire life, and eliminate vibration at cruising      speed. The 12-pound package retails for $139.50, postpaid,      and can be ordered from All-Tran Transmission Parts, Dept.      TMEN, 206 South 9th, Terre Haute, Indiana 47807.<br />      <br />      BOWSERING FOR OIL: Dogs at Southwest Research Institute in      San Antonio, Texas are being trained to sniff out oil leaks      in the insulative jackets that surround underground power      cables. The shepherds and retrievers are taught to      discriminate between the oil's odor and other environmental      smells . . . and the animals communicate the location of a      potential leak by sitting down atop the spot.<br />      <br />      SUN SKIFFS: China has developed a five-passenger,      solar-powered boat-reported to make no more noise      than an electric mixer-that ferries tourists across      West Lake near Shanghai. The roofs of the conveyances      contain 3,100 silicon chips, which convert the sun's rays      into electricity and store it in a bank of 300-watt      batteries. The crafts are fumeless, and can be started by      flipping a switch . . . and they are capable of traveling      for up to three hours on accumulated energy, if the day      turns cloudy.<br />      <br />      THE FARMERS HOME ADMINISTRATION has approved plans for a      1,055-square-foot, passive solar home that can be financed      under fmHA, HUD, FHA, Cal Vet, and VA construction      programs. The three-bedroom house-which incorporates      a Trombe wall-can be erected for about $45,000 . . .      $4,000 of which goes into building its solar features.      Plans are available for $6.00, postpaid, from the Office of      Appropriate Technology, Dept. TMEN, 1530 Tenth Street,      Sacramento, California 95814.<br />      <br />      THE ALL-HYDROGEN HOME: Billings Energy Corporation is      seeking a $20 million federal grant, part of which will be      used to construct 25 hydrogen-fueled homes in Independence,      Missouri. The houses will use hydrogen-rather than      natural gas or propane-as their primary cooking and      heating fuel. If awarded, the government funds would also      be applied to hydrogen vehicle development and the building      of coal gasification plants.<br />      <br />      GRA SSOHOL? The U.S. Customs Service in Port Everglades has      agreed to turn over its 600 tons per year in marijuana      seizures to the Florida Power and Light Company . . . so      that the utility can use the confiscated plant-instead of      oil-to fuel electricity-generating facilities.      Disposal of marijuana often poses problems . . . since the      plant burns hot enough to char the interiors of most      commercial incinerators.<br />      <br />      WE'RE FLATTERED, WE THINK. Employees at Shoreham Nuclear      Power Plant in New York have constructed a solar heater,      based on MOTHER's Heat Grabber (featured in issues 47 and      54). The workers have installed it in a quality-control      trailer at the nuclear site . . . where the little      BTU-bagger is warming the office, even on bone-chilling 12      Â° F days.<br />      <br />      GO AT THE FIRST GOOD GUST: The California Department of      Transportation has installed the nation's first windpowered      traffic-sign lighting system . . . at a remote intersection      north of Bishop, California. The setup consists of a      12-volt generator and four 12-volt heavy-duty      batteries.<br />      <br />      A SETBACK IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES: The federal Department of      Energy-which has invested nearly $15 million in Gulf      and Western Industries Inc.'s zinc-chloride battery      program-says that the unit achieves less than 65% of      its expected power and is so difficult to service that it      can be recharged only by highly trained personnel.    </p>    <p>      HEAVY CONCENTRATIONS OF RADIOACTIVE TRITIUM have been      analyzed in soil samples obtained near the crippled Three      Mile Island Unit 2 reactor .... The Tennessee Valley      Authority is using WASTE HEAT GENERATED BY WATER discharged      from its nuclear plants to grow tomatoes in greenhouses in      Alabama, and to raise catfish at an aquaculture site in      Tennessee . . . . General Telephone of Florida is testing      25 MINI-ELECTRIC VANS which can travel 50 miles-at 50- to      60-MPH speeds-on a single charge .... A Reno, Nevada      high school student has developed a program to CONVERT      GUMWEED INTO OIL. The teenager estimates that five barrels      of highgrade oil can be extracted from an acre's growth of      the desert plant .... A group of Canadian scientists have      designed an organic solar cell that duplicates plant      photosynthesis and could MATCH THE EFFICIENCY of SILICON      CELLS AT LESS THAN ONE-TENTH THEIR COST.<br />    </p>
