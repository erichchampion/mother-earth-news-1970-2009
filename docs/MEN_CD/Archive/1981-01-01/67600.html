                <p>      MOTHER's veterinarian is back again, with tips that can      help <em>anyone</em> raise his or her own backyard flock of      hens and roosters by following the . . .    </p>				<h5 id="byline">      By Randy Kidd    </h5>                            <p>      Chickens are, in my opinion, <em>ideal</em> livestock      critters for the beginning homesteader or backyard farmer.      More and more folks are discovering that raising their own      poultry can provide them with all the fresh eggs they could      ever want <em>-and</em> lots of tasty fried, roasted,      or stewed chicken as well-frequently for a      <em>fraction</em> of the commercial variety's cost!    </p>    <p>      What's more, the <em>homegrown</em> cluckers won't reach      your dinner table filled with growth stimulators, hormones,      antibiotics, and whatever else goes into storebought      poultry these days. And their eggs will actually be      <em>fresh . . .</em> with rich yellow yolks that stand      right up in the frying pan.    </p>    <p>      In addition, a backyard flock can provide a good supply of      manure for the compost pile or garden, and you can even use      your friendly fowl for pest control <em>(especially</em> in      the fruit orchard).    </p>    <p>      And, perhaps most important of all, it's really pretty      <em>easy</em> to raise chickens. In order to establish your      own flock, you'll just have to set aside a bit of space,      build a small coop, obtain a few birds, and follow my ten      commandments of poultry care . . . five of which are given      in the following paragraphs, while the other five will      constitute a <em>second</em> article, in MOTHER NO. 68.    </p>    <h3>I. RECOGNIZE YOUR MARKET</h3>    <p>      The kind of chickens you select will depend upon your      purpose in raising them. Today-thanks to the      ingenuity and selective breeding efforts of scientists and      poultry fanciers-the birds are available in all      sizes, shapes, colors, and feather patterns (there's a      total of 350 different combinations). But generally      speaking, chickens can be divided into <em>four</em> main      classifications: the egg-layers, the meatmakers (broilers),      the dual-purpose birds (meat <em>and</em> egg producers),      and the exotic or exhibition breeds.    </p>    <p>      Each general <em>type</em> of fowl is represented by      various <em>breeds,</em> which in turn comprise several      <em>varieties</em> apiece. <em>Breed</em> is a term used to      categorize a group of individuals whose characteristics can      be passed on to future generations. A <em>va</em>      riety-on the other hand-is a class of birds,      <em>within one</em> breed, that differ from <em>other      varieties</em> of that breed . . . usually by only one      characteristic. For example, the Buff Orpington and the      Black Orpington are of the same <em>breed</em> (Orpington),      but are different <em>varieties</em> within that breed (the      differing characteristic in this case is <em>color:</em>      one variety is black, the other is buff).    </p>    <p>      <em>Egg-laying</em> breeds have been developed specifically      for that single purpose. A good Leghorn (the most common      "egger" breed) will lay 250 to 300 whiteshelled breakfast      treats a year . . . but <em>don't</em> expect to use such a      bird as a fat fryer or plump roasting hen. These barnyard      fowl will barely tip the scales at four pounds . . . no      matter <em>how</em> much you feed them!    </p>    <p>      <em>Broilers,</em> on the other hand, will often weigh in      excess of eight pounds . . . and-if you keep pouring      feed into them-the roosters may reach 17 to 18      pounds. Such tasty grain-peckers can be butchered when they      are anywhere from 5 to 24 weeks old, depending on how much      meat you want from each bird. (In fact, Cornish Game Hens      are nothing more than smallish, five-weekold hens of the      Cornish Rock "broiler" breed.)    </p>    <p>      The chickens most often found on supermarket fresh meat      counters are probably eight-week-old broiler-type birds,      either male <em>or</em> female. (The roasters that are      displayed in a grocery store's frozen food case are birds      that were allowed to reach 11 to 15 weeks of age before      being butchered.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Dual-Purpose</em> breeds fall somewhere between the two      aforementioned groups in size <em>and</em> characteristics.      They will not only lay a goodly number of eggs (about 200      to 250 per year), but will also grow into fairly hefty      birds . . . weighing five to six pounds when they reach      maturity (within six months).    </p>    <p>      <em>Exotic</em> or <em>exhibition</em> birds aren't bred      for egg <em>or</em> meat production specifically. These      fowl are most often unusually colored chickens, decked out      in brilliantly hued costumes of head-to-toe feathers.      They're primarily show birds and are exhibited in various      "poultry pulchritude" competitions.    </p>    <h3>II. BUILD A GOOD      CHICKENHOUSE</h3>    <p>      Like most living creatures, a chicken sometimes needs a      place to get in out of the rain, wind, and sunshine.      Besides four walls and a roof, your birds' coop should have      a roost for the sleepyheads to doze upon (most      <em>bantams</em> won't use a roost, though) and a secluded      place for the hens to sit while laying their eggs.    </p>    <p>      Day-old chicks will need about half a square foot of indoor      floor space per bird until they're about six weeks old.      (The young birds will also need a brooder-either the      hen that hatched them or a heated enclosure-to keep      them warm. Techniques for raising chicks will be discussed      in Part II of this article.) Adults require three square      feet apiece. (If you provide an <em>outdoor</em> run as      well, the "indoor" figure can be cut in half.)    </p>    <p>      Every bird should have ten inches of roosting space. A limb      that's about two inches in diameter works well as a perch,      or you can simply round the edges of a length of 2 X 2      board. Place the roosts 24 inches from the floor, spaced 13      to 15 inches apart.    </p>    <p>      Mama hens need nest boxes to hide in while they're laying      eggs, so make a number of the simple "open-faced"      shelters-each about 12"square, with a perch in      front-and situate them 24 inches off the floor. (Not      <em>every</em> hen will need a box . . . one for every four      biddies should be plenty.)    </p>    <p>      As you build your coop, keep in mind that ventilation and      sanitation are both <em>extremely</em> important. For that      reason, the easier the shelter is to clean, the better.      Always keep plenty of fresh, <em>dry</em> litter on the      floor (there are a number of good inexpensive materials      that can be used . . . including sawdust, wood chips,      straw, old hay, and leaves).    </p>    <p>      Several times each year-using a wire      brush-scrub <em>all</em> the roosts, nest boxes,      feeders, and waterers with a solution of one tablespoon      chlorine bleach per gallon of water. [EDITOR'S NOTE: There      are differing opinions as to how frequently a chickenhouse      ought to be cleaned. Some sources even suggest that a coop      should never be completely emptied of droppings, as the      biological activity generated in soiled litter is helpful      to the chickens, and may prevent cannibalism. Let your own      judgment be your guide . . . but never allow the coop to      become obviously dirty!] You'll find your cleaning chores      easier if you put a shallow wirecovered pit beneath the      roosts. (Use a scrap wood frame covered with 1/2" wire mesh      for the "lid".) The pit will act as an easily cleaned      collector for droppings . . . which can then go directly      into the compost pile.    </p>    <p>      A <em>portable coop</em> (that is, a shelter on wheels)      will enable your poultry to serve more than one function .      . . because, with a <em>movable</em> house, it'll be easy      to transport the chickens to a fresh "pasture" every week      or so. On each site, the birds will scratch and dig . . .      and eat many of the pests that are getting ready to attack      your garden. Then-after they feast on greens and      bugs-the hens will deposit a layer of fresh soil      fertilizer. So, in essence, the birds act as miniature farm      implements. They remove weeds, turn the earth, kill the      bugs . . . and fertilize the soil!    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you have the space, it's possible to let your      feathered friends "run the range". Free-roaming birds are      able-by choosing their fare everyday -to      balance their own diets. (And giving them the run of some      pastureland is certainly easier on your budget than having      to purchase all their food. However, most "range" chickens      need to have their diets supplemented with commercial feed      containing 5 to 15% protein.)    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, unconfined birds can take daily dust baths . .      . which will help keep the critters free of mites. One word      of caution, though: Roamers can be active and aggressive      garden destroyers. They'll <em>love</em> all your      succulent, newly emerged seedlings. So either fence your      chickens' pasture in, or fence the birds <em>out</em> of      your garden!    </p>    <p>      And while you're building enclosures, keep in mind that      you'll need to provide some kind of protection from      predators. Make your range fencing-and the      coop-ratproof, and strong enough to restrain roaming dogs,      raccoons, coyotes, and other possible predators. (A      two-foot-wide band of small-mesh welded wire, secured to      the lower portion of the chickenwire fence and extending a      good six inches <em>underground,</em> should do the job.)    </p>    <h3>III. KNOW WHAT NORMAL LOOKS AND      FEELS LIKE</h3>    <p>      A healthy, normal chicken is bright-eyed, alert, and      active. If you spend some time with healthy chickens,      you'll soon be convinced that they're smarter and cuter      than most humans!    </p>    <p>      In contrast, a sickly bird will have dull and      expressionless eyes, and will sit with head drooping and      feathers fluffed out. (A hen that's "broody"-that is,      one that either is trying to hatch eggs or <em>thinks</em>      she is-will often look about the same. It'll take a      little time to learn how to recognize which chicken      "symptom" is which.)    </p>    <h3>IV. BUY ONLY THE BEST!</h3>    <p>      There are several ways to purchase chickens. Your situation      will likely determine how you choose to start <em>your</em>      flock.    </p>    <p>      Most folks get started by buying dayold chicks and raising      them at home. The babies can be bought in batches of 25,      and you can purchase <em>sexed</em> chickens (all roosters      or all hens . . . depending on whether you want meat or      eggs) or-if you don't particularly care about the      gender of the birds-"straight runs". (These are sold      just as they come out of the eggs, at about a one-to-one      ratio of males and females.)    </p>    <p>      Sexed chicks will cost around twice as much as do straight      runs. Of course-as always-prices will vary from      area to area and from breed to breed. (I've seen sexed      chicks costing anywhere from 35 cents to 75 cents a bird.)      But young roosters of <em>egg</em> <em>laying</em> breeds      should cost next to nothing . . . five  cents each is more      than they are worth to most poultry raisers. [EDITOR'S      NOTE: In MOTHER NO. 55, Ron Spomer told how he obtains      castoff cockerels for free . . . from commercial      hatcheries! Back issues cost $3.00-plus $1.00 for      shipping and handling-from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted)      P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791. ]    </p>    <p>      If you'd prefer <em>not</em> to raise the chicks yourself,      it's possible to purchase older birds that'll be ready to      lay eggs a few weeks after you receive them. These      <em>pul</em> <em>lets</em> <em>,</em> as they're called,      are usually from 18 to 20 weeks old and will cost five or      six times as much as will straight-run chicks. (You can      probably figure on paying $2.00 to $3.00 per hen.)    </p>    <p>      It might also be worth your while to purchase mature hens      from other raisers. Older biddies won't cost much, because      they'll likely be past their egg-laying prime and therefore      aren't considered very valuable. In our area, such hens run      from 50 cents to $1.50 a head.    </p>    <h3>V. BE AWARE OF THE CHICKENS'      CYCLES</h3>    <p>      An egg-laying chicken has only one year of peak egg      production. After that 12-month period, she'll molt, (lose      her feathers) and stop producing. In about six to eight      weeks the hen will <em>regrow</em> her plumage and begin to      lay again, but the number of eggs will be at least 10%      lower than during her first year. Keeping in mind that a      nonproducing chicken will cost you almost as much time and      money as will a good layer . . . you'll probably want to      consider managing your flock in the following manner:    </p>    <p>      In the spring, purchase a batch of day-old, dual-purpose      chicks (straight run). When the young'uns reach 20 to 24      weeks of age, you can butcher the roosters and expect the      hens to begin laying.    </p>    <p>      Then, the <em>following</em> spring, buy a      <em>replacement</em> batch of day-old, dual-purpose babies      and begin again. (Because many commercial breeds are      hybrids, it's usually best not to attempt to hatch your own      stock's eggs. A further explanation of this will be given      in Part II of this article, in MOTHER NO. 68. )    </p>    <p>      During that second (and each succeeding) year, when the      time comes to kill your 20- to 24-week-old roosters, you      can butcher the <em>previous</em> season's hens (for      stewing purposes) as well! And by the time you've put the      roosters and old hens in your freezer, the remaining      <em>young</em> biddies will be about to begin      <em>their</em> laying duties.    </p>    <p>      A good hen, in peak egg production, will lay about once      every 30 hours. She'll produce <em>best,</em> however, when      she's exposed to 14 daily hours of daylight. So in the      fall-when the sunshine hours decrease and egg      production tapers off-you can keep that hen fruit      rolling in by setting up an inexpensive light timer, to      keep the coop bright for the recommended 14 hours per day.    </p>    <p>      All in all, keeping a backyard flock of rooster(s) and hens      can be a very rewarding experience. You'll be .treated to      fresh, wholesome food and the opportunity to watch the      often fascinating social interaction of your birds. And if      you keep a rooster around (it isn't necessary to do so to      get eggs, but having one of the old boys in the coop does      seem to lend an air of <em>completeness</em> to the flock),      you <em>-and</em> your (we hope) tolerant      neighbors-will be treated to the early morning      crowing chorus that has wakened humankind for centuries!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Randy Kidd will be back in issue 68, to tell      us the rest of his ten commandments for productive poultry.    </p>
