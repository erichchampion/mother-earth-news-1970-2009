    <p>
                <p>      Don't just stuff your sprouts in sandwiches and salads. Try      putting the tender, crispy greens in a whole range of      dishes and enjoy . . .    </p>            <p>      As many of you know, there's something almost addictive      about sprouting: Once most folks have grown <em>one</em>      jar of the nutritious little shoots <em>(and</em>      discovered how easy it is to produce salad greens for      merely pennies per day), they've become hooked on the      process. As a result, avid sprouters occasionally have      problems trying to use up the energy-packed morsels . . .      which frequently seem to continue to expand even when      safely stored in the refrigerator!    </p>    <p>      Well, if you've often thought there must be <em>something      to</em> do with all that nourishment besides simply piling      the sprouts in sandwiches, or sprinkling them on omelets,      salads, and soups... take heart! With a little imagination,      it's possible to incorporate the crunchy tidbits into      <em>every</em> course of a meal . . . from appetizer to      dessert! So, to inspire <em>your</em> culinary      inventiveness, we've put together a sample menu for a      hearty, nutritious supper . . . in which <em>each</em> dish      is built around a particular kind of sprouted seed or bean!    </p>    <p>      <em>WHEAT BALLS</em>    </p>    <p>      To kick off any dinner gathering, try these delicious,      natural <em>hors d'oeuvres</em> : Simply mix together 1/2      cup of cream cheese with 1 cup each of sprouted wheat,      chopped-up nuts, and raisins. Once the "dough" is soft and      well blended, shape it into bite-sized spheres . . . and      roll each one in toasted wheat germ or sesame seeds. (Wheat      balls are an excellent be fore-dinner snack, and are      especially appetizing when served with rice crackers or raw      vegetables and tofu dip.)    </p>    <p>      <em>CREAM OF SOY SOUP</em>    </p>    <p>      Nothing can warm your insides on a freezing winter evening      better than homemade soup ... and this recipe, which      depends on the nutritious zing of fresh sprouts, can be      whipped up in just a few minutes! First, put 3 cups of      soybean sprouts and 1/2 cup of water in a saucepan and cook      them over low heat for about 15 minutes . . . or until the      shoots are tender. Then force the cooked sprouts-with      their broth-through a sieve, or whirl them in a      blender until smooth. Next, warm 3 cups of milk-in      the pan used to simmer the sprouts-and stir in the      soybean puree. Add sea salt, to taste, and the herbs of      your choice. (You might want to try a little cayenne,      oregano, or celery salt.) Serve the creamy soup steaming      hot, topped with alfalfa sprouts.    </p>    <p>      <em>ALFALFA RAREBIT</em>    </p>    <p>      The main dish for your "sprouted" dinner combines the      crunchiness of fresh sprouts and raw nuts with the creamy      texture of tahini (a paste made from roasted and ground      sesame seeds). First, put 2 cups of water, 1/4 cup of      unroasted cashews, 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, 1      tablespoon of whole wheat flour, 1 tablespoon of fresh      minced onion, and 1 teaspoon of sea salt into a blender.      Process the mix ture for 30 seconds, pour it into a small      pan, and warm it over low heat until it thickens.    </p>    <p>      Then remove the sauce from the burner and add 3 tablespoons      of tahini (or any nut butter), 1 tablespoon of butter, 1      tablespoon of chopped chives, and-this is the      essential ingredient-1-1/2 cups of alfalfa sprouts.      Stir this combination well and reheat it . . . but      <em>don't</em> let it come to a boil. Finally, spoon the      rarebit over thick slices of your own homemade whole wheat      toast ( <em>or</em> a steamed green vegetable) and garnish      each serving with pimento strips and sliced olives. (You      won't even <em>miss</em> the cheese found in traditional      rarebit recipes . . . although you can add your favorite if      you so desire.)    </p>    <p>      <em>SPROUT MUFFINS</em>    </p>    <p>      To make these quick biscuits, sift together 2 cups of whole      wheat flour, 2-112 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/2      teaspoon of salt. Then melt 1/4 cup of butter, and-after      it's cooled slightly-combine it (in another bowl) with 1      egg, 1 cup of milk, and 2 tablespoons of honey. Add 1 cup      of alfalfa sprouts (chopped to about 1/8 inch long) to the      milk mixture, and pour the resulting liquid into the dry      ingredients. Stir the batter briefly-just long enough to      moisten all the flour particlesand spoon it into      well-greased muffin tins, filling each cup only about      two-thirds full. Bake the treats (this recipe makes a      dozen) in a400*Foven for 25 minutes.    </p>    <p>      <em>CARROT CAKE</em>    </p>    <p>      Even dessert can be a nutritious course when it contains      sprouts! For a wholesome <em>and tasty</em> carrot cake,      cream 3/4 cup of honey with 1/2 cup of butter, andwhen the      mixture is thoroughly blendedstir in 2 egg yolks, one at a      time. (Put the whites aside for later use.) Next, beat in      the grated rind of 1 orange, 3/4 cup of grated carrot, and      1/2 cup of roasted, finely chopped soy sprouts.    </p>    <p>      Then, in a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients:      1-1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 2 teaspoons of baking      powder, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 112 teaspoon of nutmeg, and      1/2 teaspoon of sea salt. Pour 1/2 cup of milk into the dry      mixture and stir the batter well. Finally, use a wire whisk      to beat the separated egg whites until they stiffen into      peaks (but aren't dry) . . . and fold <em>them</em> into      the batter. Pour the cake mix into a greased 9"-square pan      or a 5" X 8" loaf pan, and bake it in a moderate      (350°F) oven for 40 to 45 minutes . . . or until a      knife inserted in the center comes out clean. (If you'd      like to "dress up" the dessert a little, you can frost it      with an orangehoney glaze.)    </p>    <p>      <em>CHIA MARIA</em>    </p>    <p>      Believe it or not, you can even <em>drink</em> your      sprouts, as in this unusual version of a traditional      beverage. Two servings of Chia Maria require 2 cups of      tomato juice, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 chopped hot      green chili (which is optional), 1/2 cup of chia sprouts, a      touch of Tabasco, a pinch of salt, and a dash of      Worcestershire sauce (also optional). Simply mix the      ingredients together for 30 seconds in a blender, and serve      each drink with a sprig of parsley. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Chia      seeds aren't sprouted in the conventional manner. Read the      sidebar that accompanies this article for more      information.]    </p>    <p>      As <em>these recipes indicate, there are lots</em> of ways      to use sprouts other than the standard "throw a few in here      or there" kitchen strategy. So if your counters are      overflowing with jars and trays spilling out      <em>crunchy</em> green shoots, do <em>not</em> throw away      <em>the</em> surplus. <em>Use</em> <em>your      imagination</em> ... and have a sprout dinner!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The recipes in this ar ticle have been      adapted by permission from The Sprouter's Cookbook by      Marjorie Page Blanchard, copyright© 1975 by Garden Way      Publishing, Dept.

Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28791.    </p>    <h3>Grow Them Yourself</h3>        <p>      Just in case you've never tried rais ing sprouts, here's a      quick refresher course in the basic technique.    </p>    <p>      The most common method of germinating seeds for the table      requires a wide-mouthed quart jar. Measure about 1/2 cup of      dry beans, or 2 to 3 tablespoons of tiny seeds, into the      glass container, and then half-fill it with water. You'll      need to fit some kind of sieve over the jar to allow      water-but not seeds-to pass through. It's      possible to use a piece of cheesecloth or old nylon      stocking with a rubber band around the rim to hold it      securely . . . or to buy a screw-on ring with stainless or      plastic mesh already attached. (The screened      lids-such as the one shown in the photo-come      with various sizes of holes to accommodate many different      types of seeds. They're available in any health food      store.)    </p>    <p>      Let the seeds soak overnight, and then pour off the water .      . . which will probably have clouded up just a bit. (That      liquid, by the way, makes a wonderful fertilizer for your      houseplants, since it's loaded with minerals that were      leached away from the seeds.) Rinse the kernels with cool,      fresh water, and lay the jar on its side in a dark place to      drain.    </p>    <p>      Remember that germinating seeds need both air circulation      and moisture, so make sure your sprouts-to-be have plenty      of each. If you place the jar in a cabinet, leave the door      slightly open. Rinse the seeds two or three times daily . .      . making sure that you completely pour off all the water in      the jar each time, since the seeds will easily ferment if      they remain soaked.    </p>    <p>      The sprouting kernels are also sen sitive to heat (they're      quite difficult to grow in extremely hot and humid weather)      and cold: Some varieties may not even germinate when your      house gets overly chilly on winter nights. (If this becomes      a problem, you can wrap the sprouting jar in a towel or      flannel shirt and place it near a burning light bulb.)    </p>    <p>      If all goes well, you'll probably see the seed cases pop      open and send out tiny shoots within 48 hours . . . and      most types of sprouted seeds will be ready to eat in three      or four days. Once they're fully developed, you may want to      place the shoots in the sunlight for several hours so their      leaves can "green up" to a healthy color. Then remove the      sprouts from the jar and store them in the refrigerator in      a closed container or plastic bag, where the crisp young      delicacies will keep for as long as one week    </p>    <p>      Some seeds will also sprout when treated to the      paper-towel-and-drain ing-rack technique: Simply cover a      rack or tray with a double thickness of damp towels . . .      sprinkle the presoaked seeds out evenly over the paper . .      . and then cover them with a top layer of damp toweling.      Place the assembly in a dark cupboard and keep the seeds'      atmosphere moist by resoaking, and wringing out, the top      towels whenever necessary.    </p>    <p>      Small, gelatinous seeds-such as chia, cress, radish,      and buckwheat - <em>shouldn't</em> be soaked      overnight . . . since they might absorb too much liquid and      turn into a mucilaginous mass. Instead, such waterretaining      kernels may be kept barely moist in the saucer of an      unglazed clay flower pot. Wash and thoroughly soak the      porous dish (so that it won't steal moisture from the      thirsty kernels), and measure into it equal quantities of      seeds and water. Let everything stand undisturbed until all      the liquid is absorbed by the seeds, then set the saucer in      a larger dish with water in the bottom, and keep the      environment dark by placing a plate over the assembly. If      the water in the bowl is kept at a constant level, the      seeds will absorb whatever moisture they need through the      clay . . . and sprout within a few days.    </p>    <p>      Still <em>another</em> method is used to germinate      sunflower seeds. For the how-to on <em>that</em> technique,      read "Sunflower Sprouts" in MOTHER NO. 60, page 193. (Back      issues are available-for $3.00 each, plus $1.00      shipping and handling per order-from THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS(restricted), P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina      28791.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, it's very important to keep your sprouting      equipment clean, because bacteria may develop if the seeds      happen to ferment. So, after you harvest each crop of      sprouts, sterilize the glass jar-or wash and scrub      the clay saucer-you used.    </p>    <p>      By following the simple tips in this article, you ought to      be able to satisfy your "snowbound" green thumb and provide      healthful, delicious greens for your table at the same      time. So get out those jars, saucers, and paper towels . .      . and set out on a sprouting adventure!    </p>
