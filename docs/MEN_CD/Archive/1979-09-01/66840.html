                    <p>      Dinny Slaughter says you can take one more step toward      independence if you learn how to...    </p>        <p>      A lot of homesteading folks who have made the smart move of      raising their own beef steer turn right around when "      harvesting time" comes and send that ready-for-slaughtering      animal off to a professional butcher. The truth is, how      ever, that there's no <em>need</em> to pay someone else to      kill, skin, and quarter your animal. Because-although      the job, like most any move to greater self-sufficiency,      does involve a good bit of labor and no little      mess-you and a single helper can accomplish the same      task yourselves ... in just a few hours.    </p>    <h3>      HERE'S HOW    </h3>    <p>      Start by choosing a nice late fall A (Here in Virginia's      Shenandoah Valley, we do our butchering-"before the      flies arise"-on a November morning. If you plan to      cool the carcass yourself, though, you might prefer      starting the job in the early evening.) Gather your      equipment-you'll need some knives, saws, a hoist, a      support, and a spreader-and <strong>round</strong> up      a helper. Then confine your steer and shoot it.    </p>    <p>      Take your time with the killing and do it as cleanly as      possible. Fill a 12-gauge shotgun with high brass No. 4 or      5 shot, stand about 10 feet from the steer, and imagine two      lines drawn from the base of each ear to the opposite eye.      Then carefully aim for the spot where the lines cross ...      and fire. The shot will make a silverdollar- sized hole in      the animal's skull, and the beast will immediately drop to      the ground.    </p>    <p>      At that point you (or your assistant) should keeping your      back to the body and watching for thrashing      hooves-set one foot against the animal's forelegs and      force its head back as far as possible with your other      foot. Then, using a sharp knife, cut along the bottom of      the neck for about 10 to 15 inches-the breastbone      forward-and make the incision deep enough to expose      the wind-pipe without piercing it. Next, insert the knife      to one side of the windpipe (with the <em>back</em> of the      blade against the breastbone) and press the      point-toward the spine-to a depth of four      inches or so ... to cut the carotid arteries and jugular      veins.    </p>    <p>      After the carcass has bled as much as it will, drag it to a      clean area to be skinned. (For obvious health reasons,      cleanliness is essential during this entire operation.)      Prop the animal on its back, then start your skinning cuts      by slicing the hide around each foot and making a long slit      down the inside of each leg. Complete these incisions with      one long center cut-down the middle of the      body-from the beef's anus to its throat. Then use      your knife to slice through any membranes and peel the skin      back off the body. Let gravity help with as much of the      work as possible.    </p>        <p>      This is also the time-while you've got the carcass on      its back-to cut through the brisket. Use a hacksaw or      handsaw, and avoid slicing into the internal organs. The      same tool can then be employed to remove all four feet just      above the ankles.    </p>    <p>      Your next job will be to suspend the animal ... so you can      finish skinning the beef and clean out its internal organs.      Cut large slits in each of the steer's two rear legs,      between the Achilles tendon and the main bone ... but      <em>don't</em> cut the tendon! Insert a crosspiece of      strong wood or pipe through the two gashes (we we a solid      steel "spreader" with hooks on the ends). Then fasten is      beef "tree" to your hoisting line and run that cable over a      very sturdy tree limb (or through a metal ring suspended      from a large tripod).    </p>    <p>      Attach the free end of line to a winch and start winding.      Each crank of the come-along will raise the thousand-pound      carcass only a fraction of an inch ... but before long      you'll have hoistedeasilythe entire beef up in the air.    </p>    <p>      One worker should now skin the hide off the back side,      while the other makes the main body cut from the anus, down      the center of the belly, to the previously sawed brisket.      To begin this major incision, slice around the rear      opening-until that canal is free-and then seal      off the end with string. Remove the tail at its base and      start cutting the body wall membranes that hold the      intestines and other organs. The pull of gravity will help      clean those innards out. (Be sure to trim off the large      globs of fat positioned along the backbone.) Separate the      heart and liver from the other organs, slice open the heart      so that clotted blood can escape, and carefully cut the      bitter gallbladder sack from the liver. Immerse these two      major organs in a bucket of water to cool them    </p>    <p>      At this point, the skinner should have finished his or her      job. Roll the hide up carefully and save it (the leather      covering is worth about $8.00 to your local raw fur buyer).      Next, cut off the head, pry open the mouth, and slice      between the lower and upper jaws to remove the tongue. (Use      an old knife when working in the steer's mouth ... because      the necessary scraping against bones and teeth will surely      dull the blade.)    </p>    <p>      Now take a short breather and admire your handiwork. An      entire beef carcass is hanging right before your eyes. The      only major chore left is to separate the meat into two      parts by sawing straight down the backbone ... from the      tail to the neck. You can do this job with your hacksaw      <em>and</em> a whole lot of arm power. Or you might want to      take the easy way out (as we do) and use a chain saw.      That's right, an ordinary tree-felling <em>chain saw.</em>      (Be sure, of course, to first remove ALL the oil from the      machine's reservoir and blade.)    </p>    <p>      Here's the technique: The saw's operator works from the      backside of the carcass, while his partner stands on the      opposite side and guides the sawyer-using hand      signals-to ensure a straight cut. (A third person-if      the extra help is available- should steady the swinging      meat.) After that brief operation is over, hose-or      dousethe carcass with cold water, wipe it clean with a      cloth, and let it drain.    </p>    <p>      You're now ready to back your truck under the two beef      halves and load the meat. Make handsawed cuts-just      above the bottom ribs-and the two front quarters will      drop neatly &to the rear of your vehicle. Then simply      lower the winch and unhook the hindquarters.    </p>    <p>      You're done ... you've just killed and skinned your beef.      The meat will, of course, still have to be processed ...      and if you want to tackle that jobjointing and preserving      meal-sized pieces of beef-take a look at the      shorter sidebar that accompanies this article for several      good sources of information.    </p>    <h3>      EAT BEEF FOR JUST PENNIES A POUND!    </h3>    <p>      Because I kill and skin my own beef I've been able to      supply my family with meat at a cost of only <em>penni      es</em> per pound. Impossible, you say? Not it you do      things my way.    </p>    <p>      Here's Me scoop: In-late November, buy a good 500- to      600-pound steer at the market price. Pasture the animal      until the following October. On the first day of that      month, pen We beast up, and fatten it for 30 days on a diet      of grain ration plus good-quality hay. Then kill and skin      the steer and sell <em>one-half of</em> the carcass at      market price. Use the money received from that sale to      purchase <em>another</em> steer for next year ... and keep      the "leftover" side of beef for yourself!    </p>		    <p>      You've got an approximately 300- side of beef that cost you      only $40 ... or a piddling 13  cents <em>a pound!</em> Not      only that, you also have $338 in cash to invest in next      year's steer ... so no major investment comes out of your      pocket after the f irst year!    </p>    <p>      I know, I know ... you think this sounds too good to be      true, that I must be juggling figures or something.    </p>    <p>      But I'm not. It works.    </p>		<hr />    <h3>      READY FOR STORAGE    </h3>    <p>      More information about beef processing can be found in      Wilbur F. Eastman, Jr.'s The Canning, Freezing, Cur ing      Smoking of Meat, Fish Game ($5.95, Garden Way Publishing      Company) and <em>Butchering, Processing and      Preservation</em> of Meat by Frank G.
