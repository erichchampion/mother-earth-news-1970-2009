                <p>      When you learn the "craft of cuttings", you can grow      high-cost...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Richard Schmidt    </h5>    <p>      Richard Schmidt Many of the most popular decorative (and      practical) shrubs, trees, vines, or fruits can be      propagated by the simple technique of rooting a piece of a      "parent" plant. In fact-since one such "adult" can      produce hundreds of identical offspring-this is the      chief method used by professional nurseries to multiply      woody vegetation. The information that follows-along      with a little time and patience-can provide you with      all the landscape material you want for your yard or      homestead!    </p>        <h3>      LEAFY AND DORMANT    </h3>    <p>      There are two kinds of cuttings: "leafy" types that are      taken and rooted during the growing season, and "dormant"      twigs that are clipped in the winter months.    </p>    <p>      In addition, the leafy category can be divided into two      subgroups: [1] "softwood" cuttings-which come from      succulent new growth-and [2] "half-ripe" (or      "semi-hardwood") cuttings that are taken from partially      mature stems. Half-ripe wood is usually easier to work      with, because it's quite resistant to the plant      propagator's chief enemy: rot. You can test a      branch-to see if it's half-ripe-by bending the      twig. Semi-hardwood stems snap and break cleanly . . .      while wood that's too old-or too young-folds over onto      itself without breaking.    </p>    <p>      Dormant cuttings, on the other hand, are taken from fully      mature one-year-old wood while the plants are "asleep" . .      . from late fall through winter. Such cuttings remain      inactive until spring, when-miraculously-many      of them will send forth both roots and leaves to form new      plant life.    </p>    <p>      Now let's take a look at how to propagate both leafy and      dormant cuttings, using some familiar plants as examples.    </p>    <h3>      FROM LEAFY TO LUSH    </h3>    <p>      Pyracantha (or firethorn)-a shrub with bright autumn      berries-is easy to multiply from half-ripe leafy      cuttings.    </p>    <p>      First you'll need a "stock" pyracantha that's vigorous,      healthy, and free from pests. The bush must also possess      the genetic traits-such as berry color-that      you'll want to see in the "new" plants.    </p>    <p>      Take cuttings (from branches that pass the snap-when-bent      test) three to six inches long ... with two leaf buds,      stripped bare, at the base and three to six leaves on top.      Cut the bottoms-just below a bud-with clippers      that make a clean, sharp slice.    </p>    <p>      Next, insert each cutting-to about a third of its      length-in a soilless medium that retains moisture      without becoming waterlogged. Some good choices for this      purpose are vermiculite, perlite, or either of the two in a      50/50 mixture with damp peat moss. (Soil should be avoided      because it may contain rot-producing bacteria and fungi.)    </p>    <p>      Both the growth speed and chance of success will increase      if you dip the moistened lower quarter-inch of each stem in      a rooting hormone powder (available through most      nurseries), many of which also contain a fungicide to      retard stem rot.    </p>    <p>      Clay or plastic flowerpots-between four and six      inches in diameter-make good rooting containers. Fill      them with your "starting" medium, make a hole (use a pencil      for this) for each cutting, and insert the stems . . .      being careful not to knock off the rooting powder. (You can      put as many cuttings in a pot as the container will hold,      as long as the leaves of adjacent plants can't mat on top      of one another.) After planting, water the rooting medium      and allow the excess liquid to drain off.    </p>    <p>      Professional growers use shallow wood or plastic "flats"      for rooting containers. An 18-inch-square by two-inch-deep      container can accommodate 200 cuttings.    </p>    <h3>      INFANT PLANT CARE    </h3>    <p>      During the rooting period (anywhere from six weeks for      pyracantha to several months for slower species), the      cuttings must be kept moist and out of direct sunlight. A      closed plastic bag placed around both container and      cuttings-propped up so as not to rest on the      foliage-will create a miniature greenhouse with ideal      rooting conditions.    </p>    <p>      After six weeks, test for roots by giving one of your      mini-trees a gentle pull. If it rises up in the medium,      it's not ready yet.    </p>    <p>      Once the roots are sufficient, accustom the small plants to      the outdoor environment by first opening the plastic bag .      . . then removing it-bit by bit-over a two-week      period. Be cautious, because the leaves will have become      tender in their protected world. (From this point on you      must also begin to water the cuttings regularly.)    </p>    <p>      When the tiny shrubs have had time to become acclimated to      the outside world, they're ready to transplant. Just invert      the pot and tap its edge firmly on a wood surface: The      entire ball of plants and roots will fall into your hand.      Separate the plants carefully and quickly . . . working out      of the direct sun or wind to prevent drying, which would      injure the roots.    </p>    <p>      Whether you pot the plants individually or move them to a      nursery bed is a matter of personal preference. I pot mine      directly in one-gallon cans which I obtain free from      restaurants and institutional kitchens. (Wash the cans and      punch four holes in the bottom with a church-key opener.)    </p>    <p>      Regardless of where you plant, however, be sure to use a      good potting soil (equal parts soil, garden compost, and      coarse organic matter such as ground bark or chunk peat      moss), water the bushes frequently-but not so often      as to waterlog the soil-and protect the foliage from      bright sun until the plants are established. (An "umbrella"      of wood lath or window screening will provide shade when      placed above a sunny cold frame.)    </p>    <p>      After a year or so of active growth, the cuttings may be      planted in their permanent locations. Continue babying      them, though, against drought, excessive sun, and cold      until they're well settled.    </p>    <h3>      FROM DORMANT TO DELIGHTFUL    </h3>    <p>      Grapes-a prime example of plants that can be grown      from dormant cuttings-are best propagated from mature      wood . . . cut after the leaves have dropped in the fall.      As a matter of fact, grape cuttings can be made when the      vines receive their annual pruning.    </p>    <p>      A good grape cutting should be about the diameter of a      pencil and approximately 12 inches long. It must have four      leaf buds: two to be buried beneath the soil and two that      are left exposed. (You'll want to plant your grapevine      "right side up", so make a slanted cut at its base and a      straight slice at the top . . . to help you remember which      end is which.)    </p>    <p>      In climates where the soil freezes, cuttings are best made      in the fall ... then bundled and buried in loose,      welldrained soil until spring. Some propagators like to      bury their cuttings horizontally . . . while others put 'em      in the ground vertically but "upside down", on the theory      that spring warmth near the surface will stimulate root      development from basal buds before the cooler "tops" leaf      out.    </p>    <p>      In milder climates, cuttings may be taken anytime before      spring sap flows . and planted either in the ground where      the vines are to grow, or in a nursery bed. (Since some      grape loss is certain, always plant extra cuttings.)    </p>    <h3>      INDIVIDUAL NEEDS    </h3>    <p>      By now you're probably eager to know just which trees,      bushes, or vines can best be propagated using each of the      above methods, and I've prepared some charts (which      accompany this article) giving the preferred cutting      procedure for many popular landscape plants.    </p>    <p>      Finally, here's a footnote for those folks who live in cold      climates: It's easy to propagate exotic plants (citrus, for      example) for indoor, outdoor, or greenhouse use if you can      find a source for the cutting.    </p>    <p>      I have a lemon and a mandarin-both rooted from      half-ripe cuttings-which grow, bloom, and fruit in      seven-inch clay pots. Wood from young trees roots more      readily than does that from old, and lemons are easier to      propagate than most other citrus varieties.    </p>    <p>      Hibiscus and fuchsias are other warmzone plants that are      easy to multiply and well worth the effort. You'll also      find that many of the tropicals and semitropicals found in      conservatories are among the easiest plants to grow from      cuttings.    </p>    <p>      So the next time you want to beat the high cost of      nursery-grown foliage, try a little cutting instead!    </p>
