                <p>      All over the country, owners of MOTHER's Waste-Oil Heater      are-at this very moment-stocking up on free      heating fuel!    </p>        <p>      As the weather turns cold, it's a sure bet that the      "gasoline crisis" of this past summer will turn into a      national shortage of winter heating fuels. Worse yet, while      the gas pump problem has <em>inconvenienced</em> lots of      folks, a lack of home-heating energy could be      <em>dangerous.<br />      <br /></em> However, as MOTHER pointed out <em>last</em>      year (in Issue No. 53, page 104) there's a way to obtain      <em>free</em> fuel to heat your garage, workshop, or home .      . . and that source of energy-used motor      oil-can be burned in MOTHER's Waste-Oil Heat er,      which you can build for a total investment of about $36 and      no more than one day of your time!    </p>

It's an easy matter to strain the oil: All you have to do is follow the instructions in MOTHER's plans...
