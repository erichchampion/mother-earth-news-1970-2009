                        <h3>      You can bake flavorful loaves without using refined      commercial sweeteners!    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      by NANCY M. HOCH    </h5>    <p>      Although many North American cooks have never even      <em>heard</em> of diastatic malt ... this healthful      sweetener is one of the most important ingredients in just      about every loaf of bread baked in Europe. Despite its      imposing name, the substance is simply sprouted wheat or      barley ... and it would be hard to imagine a better      substitute for sugar or honey!    </p>    <p>      As you probably know, "sweets" do a lot more than just add      flavor to breads ... such ingredients provide a necessary      feeding medium for the yeast <em>and</em> act as browning      agents, as well.    </p>    <p>      Diastatic malt handles these chores efficiently and is      economical <em>(and</em> easy to make! ) in the bargain. In      fact, the flavorful grain even increases the nutritional      value of bread (by adding enzymes and vitamins) and helps      loaves retain their freshness. When malt is used i n proper      amounts, it improves both the taste and texture of "the      staff of life" . . . while providing another means of      cutting down on the use of heavily refined white sugar.    </p>    <h3>      MALT MIXIN'    </h3>    <p>      Non-pearled barley (the grain used in "traditional"      diastatic malt) is difficult-if not      impossible-for the home baker to obtain, so you'll      probably want to make your sprouted sweetener from wheat.    </p>    <p>      Simply place one cup of the grain In a sprouting jar (any      container with a capacity of five cups or more-topped      with nylon net-will do) and cover the kernels with      four cups of tepid water. After the wheat has soaked for 12      hours, drain It. (And as always, save this nutritious water      for use in soups <em>or</em> in your bread.)    </p>    <p>      The sprouting process will take a day and a half to two      days. During this time, make sure to rinse the tiny shoots      three times a day to prevent molding. (If you set the jar      by the kitchen sink, you won't forget to perform this chore      when preparing or cleaning up afteryour meals.)    </p>    <p>      When your sprouts reach the " rootlet" stage (they'll be      about as long as the wheat kernel itself), it's time to      dehydrate 'em. Just spread the little plants out on a      cookie sheet and put 'em in a 150 deg F oven for eight      hours ... or until they're <em>completely</em> dry. Then      grind the sweetener-to-be in a grain mill (or in a powerful      blender): The end result will be inexpensive diastatic      malt. (You can, of course, purchase ready-made malt      commercially ... but why pay someone else to perform such      an easy task?)    </p>    <p>      The prepared sweet grain should be stored in a      refrigerated, well-covered jar. One "sprouting's" worth      will last you a good long time ... because just <em>one      cup</em> of malt is enough to sweeten approximately 150      loaves of bread! The basic rule is to use a <em>single      teaspoon</em> of the dried sprouted wheat in place of all      the sugar or honey that's normally required    </p>    <p>      in any four-loaf batch of bread. (In fact, too much of the      potent sweet will overpower your mixture's yeast buds ...      and the dough will become sticky and unmanageable.)    </p>    <h3>      QUICK WHOLE WHEAT MALT      BREAD    </h3>    <p>      Measure 5-1/2 cups of lukewarm water into a large      (six-quart) container. Add 4 tablespoons of yeast and let      the mixture stand until the leavening begins to dissolve.      Then add 1/2 cup of oil, 1 teaspoon of malt, 1/2 cup of      gluten flour (optional), 2 tablespoons of salt, 1/4 cup of      lecithin (optional), 3/4 cup of whey powder or dried milk,      and 6 cups of unsifted whole wheat flour. Beat the      ingredients thoroughly-with a spoon or an electric      mixer-until a "spongy" consistency is reached, and      let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes before stirring in      7 or 8 additional cups of unsifted whole wheat flour. Knead      the mixture on a floured breadboard, and let it rest-      again- while you grease your loaf pans.    </p>    <p>      Divide the dough and form it into 4 or 5 loaves (smaller      pans will produce more "reliable" whole wheat bread). Cover      the containers with a towel and put them in a warm spot to      rise ... but <em>never</em> allow the loaves to reach more      than 3-1/2 inches in height. If time permits,      <em>remold</em> each loaf-allowing the dough to rise      again after each shaping-one or two additional times:      This process will produce a more finely textured bread.    </p>    <p>      Bake the delicious and healthful treats in a preheated      oven-350 to 375 Â°F - for 35 to 40 minutes.      Remove the finished loaves from their pans immediately . .      . and <em>try</em> to avoid eating the whole batch while      it's still warm and fragrant.    </p>
