                    <p>      <strong><em>Douglas and Sara Balcomb spend their winter      evenings barefoot, in an 80% solar-heated adobe      masterpiece</em></strong>    </p>                <p>        The city of Santa Fe, New Mexico-nestled against        the treeline in the cool, dry foothills of the Sangre de        Cristo Mountains-just has to be one of the best        places in this country to make use of solar energy.        Blessed with abundant sunshine-and a relatively low        latitude of 36 degrees-the capital of the "Land of        Enchantment" also has a real need for heating.      </p>      <p>        You see, although most people think of New Mexico as warm        desert country, Santa Fe-which is perched just at        the 7,000-foot line-is actually slightly cooler (on        an average) than Denver, Colorado! While Santa Feans        seldom have to suffer through more than a few consecutive        days of subfreezing daytime highs, the mercury does        plummet below zero on some winter evenings, and the        town's average annual snowfall is over three feet.      </p>      <p>        In fact, in heating energy terminology, Santa Fe has        almost 6,000 heating degree days. (This figure represents        the total number of degrees that the mean temperature        falls below 65°F during the year.) For comparison,        Denver averages about 5,700 heating degree days, and New        York nets approximately 5,250. And-just as an        extreme example-Edmonton, Alberta rings in at        almost 11,700 degree days.      </p>      <p>        It's not too surprising, then, that the hillsides above        the quaint old historical New Mexican community (it was        established around 1610) are dotted with adobe homes        equipped with a wide range of solar heating equipment.        And one of the most attractive (and successful) examples        of this combination of new-age technology and age-old        earthen home construction methods belongs to Douglas and        Sara Balcomb.      </p>      <p>        We are fortunate enough to have detailed records of the        performance of this solar-heated home, because both        Balcombs are intensely involved in solar energy. In fact,        Dr. Balcomb-who currently works in passive solar        energy research at Sandia Laboratories-has        published information on his family home in a Department        of Energy pamphlet entitled Passive Solar Buildings: A        Compilation of Data and Results (SAND 77-1204 [Revised]).        And Sara-who is vice-chairperson of the New Mexico        Solar Energy Association-takes part in the        preparation of a regular solar newsletter and various        sun-energy teaching aids (such as slide shows).      </p>      <p>        The Balcomb home is known as Unit One, because it was the        original dwelling in a planned environmental community        called First Village. Architect William        Lumpkins-with solar engineers/ designers/builders        Susan and Wayne Nichols-chose to blend a selection        of solar techniques (many of which were pioneered by        solar innovator Hal Miguel and used in his own Tusuque,        New Mexico residence) ... rather than invest all their        capital and energy in one system.      </p>      <p>        The resulting hybrid solar design consists of a        greenhouse, a thermal mass wall, and two rock heat        storage beds equipped with fans. This solar collecting        system is not only fully integrated into the building's        design (and thus made attractive)... it really works: In        the high-energydemand New Mexico highlands environment,        Unit One is 80% solar heated to a minimum temperature of        65°F. So, with 4/5 of the warmup" duties handled by        ol' Sol, the Balcombs' backup electric heaters consume an        average of only 850 KWH per year ... or roughly $48 (at        the current power rate in New Mexico). Many folks would        be overjoyed to spend that little on heat in one month!      </p>      <h3>        THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT      </h3>            <p>        Over 80% of Unit One's solar-collected warmth enters        passively through the 409 square feet of double-pane        thermal glass which forms the greenhouse. The L-shaped        house is entirely faced-along its southern        exposure-by this solarium. Twothirds of the glass        (that is, 16 of the standard patio-size 32" X 76" glass        panels) is angled at 60 degrees to throw sunlight on an        adobe wall which separates the greenhouse from the living        area. The other eight double-glazed panes stand        vertically-at ground level-and the center two        can be opened to provide ventilation.      </p>      <p>        The earthen wall-which tapers from a 14" thickness        at its base to 10" at its peak some 20 feet above the        floor level-is the primary storage and transfer        system for Unit One's solar heating. By noon on a chilly        winter day, the surface temperature of the wall will        climb to as high as 110°F. Then slowly-over the        course of the next 10 hours-that heat works its way        through the earth-brick barrier. By 10:00 p.m. the inside        of the wall reaches about 80°F ... and keeps the        living area warm through the remainder of the night. By        morning, however, most of the heat is dissipated ...        leaving the adobe ready to temper the living area through        the day (when-even in the winter-the home's        interior would otherwise warm rapidly). This slow        transfer of the heat of the sun is what solar engineers        call indirect gain.      </p>      <p>        But there is a direct gain element in the passive system,        too. The air in the greenhouse is-of        course-also sun-heated ... and this warm, moist        (and oxygenated by the plants) air can be introduced into        the upstairs and downstairs by simply opening doors into        those areas. Thus the Balcomb home is not only solar        heated, but also has its own air filtration and        humidification system. As Sara says, "It's a natural        warmth. Many of the standard discomforts usually        associated with winter are now things of the past: Cold        feet, static electricity, dry skin, morning sore throat        ... they've all disappeared."      </p>      <h3>        STORING THE EXCESS      </h3>      <p>        The majority of Unit One's solar-heating methods are        totally passive, requiring no controls, no fuel, and no        maintenance. But had the homes planners stopped at that        point, much of the incoming energy would have been        wasted. The fact is that-even on winter        days-the greenhouse frequently draws in more energy        than can be transmiffed through the wall ... and that's        where Unit One's active solar system comes into play.        Rather than just vent this excess heat to the outside,        the modem adobe's designers added a storage system.      </p>      <p>        Beneath the building's living room, dining room, and        kitchen lie two rock storage beds-one 2' X 10' X        19', and the other 2' X 10' X 15' - containing a        total of 50 tons of three- to five-inch-diameter        cobblestones. These heat storage areas are connected, by        ducts, to the greenhouse. Whenever the solarium's air        temperature rises more than five degrees above the        temperature of the stones, air is forced down from the        top of the greenhouse and into the rock beds ... by two        fans located in the backs of the bedroom closets. Thus        the Balcombs can enjoy 70°F floors-with the        heat being transmitted through the six-inch slab by means        of convection-as well as 80°F walls.      </p>      <p>        Unit One's primordial "batteries" also provide the        dwelling with a heat storage capacity which can see the        Balcombs through extended spells of inclement weather.        And-while the home's two- to three-day storage        capability doesn't match the staying power of a more        expensive, totally active collector setup-Dr.        Balcomb points out that a passive system is (in one way,        at least) more efficient: Even on the snowiest Santa Fe        day, Unit One's solar features are still absorbing same        energy ... because dispersed sunlight is better than none        at all. But the active collector unit that provides the        Balcombs' domestic hot water supply requires more intense        light to operate. (For example, there have been a number        of days since Unit One's completion-in August of        1976-when there was a passive solar homeheat gain,        while the water heater didn't receive enough sunlight to        operate at all.)      </p>      <h3>        HANG ON TO WHAT YOU'VE GOT ...      </h3>      <p>        It's impossible to build and maintain an energyefficient        house without proper insulation, and the Balcomb home is        no exception to this rule. The thermal mass wall -        which serves as the dwelling's nighttime heater -        is also (in effect) an insulator: The wall's heat        transfer function prevents it from having any significant        heat loss ... since the outer surface losses are turned        into inner surface gains. The building's east and west        walls, however-which are also constructed of adobe        - are more directly insulative. Though their mass        does tend to delay inside temperature changes -        just as does the greenhouse wall-they don't transfer any        significant amount of solar heat to the home's interior.      </p>      <p>        The north-facing wall is buried below ground level to a        depth of four and a half feet. This subterranean portion        is built of eight-inch concrete blocks (with the cells        filled for extra insulation) and is sealed with plastic        roofing cement and two inches of rigid polystyrene. Above        ground level, the northern wall consists of a        stucco-covered frame of 2" X 8" studs on 16" centers ...        and is insulated by a 1-1/2" layer of fiberglass batt, a        vapor space, and then six more inches of fiberglass batt.        Three inches of urethane foam in the roof complete Unit        One's insulation package.      </p>      <h3>        ..AND GET AMAZING THERMAL STABILITY      </h3>      <p>        There is a popular misconception that life in a passively        heated solar home involves some compromises ... such as        donning and shedding clothing as the weather changes,        lighting fires for extra warmth, etc.      </p>      <p>        Sara Balcomb, however, has a bone to pick with such        "myths": "I believed all that myself," she says, "until I        lived through a winter in my passive home." And Dr.        Balcomb's careful records of year-round temperatures in        Unit One certainly show that the supposed necessity for        compromise is indeed a myth ... at least in this        particular solar abode.      </p>      <p>        The dwelling's thermal mass wall and        insulation-combined with its 20% active storage        capability -conspire to keep Unit One's inside        temperature incredibly stable. During the month of        December 1977, for instance, the Balcombs' living area's        temperatures varied by a grand total of 40: from 67°F        to 71°F.      </p>      <p>        Sara claims that it takes about two days for the house to        react to a change in weather, and that there is never        more than a 50 swing in any 24-hour period. The actual        recorded extremes for the house are a low of 65°F in        February (limited by the electric baseboard units, which        are thermostatically controlled at 65°F) and a high        (A 76°F on a 97°F summer afternoon. And, as Sara        points out, "A variance of 21° is hard to achieve        even with conventional air conditioning ... but we did it        simply by natural means."      </p>      <p>        Temperatures do fluctuate in be gymhouse, naturally ...        on many days by as much as 35°F. This rise and fall        is merely evidence of solar heating at work. Still, the        coldest temperature the Balcomb Mans have ever had to        tolerate was 45°F (on a -17°F winter night),        while the hottest summertime high was 98°F Judging by        the health of the resident greenery, the solarium's        moderated outdoor environment is no hardship.      </p>      <p>        And, of course, the solar techniques that heat Unit One        also function to keep the Balcombs cool in the summer.        When the sun is at its higher "warm season" angle, a roof        overhang (and the balcony) shade the adobe wall from any        direct sunlight. The mass of the wall then serves as a        stabilizer ... and thoroughly negates the radical        temperature extremes of the desert day and night.      </p>      <p>        The storage system can also be used-by reversing        its thermostatic control-to cool the rock beds at        night and transfer the chill during the following day. To        prevent overheating of the greenhouse during hot spells,        the builders positioned vents at the base of the vertical        windows and at the top of the staircase. Natural        convection currents can thus introduce cool air at the        bottom and usher heat out the top.      </p>      <h3>        THE COSTS ... THE BENEFITS      </h3>      <p>        Unit One cost a total of $104,000, of which $24,000 went        for the lot. Approximately $12,000 was spent on the solar        heating system ... but $8,000 of that expense was granted        by the Department of Housing and Urban Development under        the 1974 Solar Demonstration Act. (Of course, any current        solar construction has a portion of its cost offset by        the federal 101% tax allowance and various state tax        breaks.)      </p>      <p>        Still, the per-foot price of about $42 (for the        1,900-square-foot home) may seem a bit steep to many        readers. If so, bear in mind that housing costs in the        Santa Fe area we higher than most regions by several        dollars a square foot. Then peer at the photos for a        moment to take h. the ab- sence of economy measures in        the dwelling's construction. To an adobe fancierand the        lure of an earthen home "growing" out of the land is very        real to many folksthe Balcomb house falls somewhere        between shelter and art.      </p>      <p>        Furthermore, Unit One is a thing of beauty that works ...        and works with the environment. It is built of earth and        draws most of its heat from the sun. Inside its walls and        windows the Balcombs enjoy a lifestyle which dispels most        of the myths about passive solar living ... in the kind        of comfort that none of their previous homes could offer.      </p>      <h3>        MORE ON ADOBE      </h3>      <p>        If you're interested in finding out more about adobe        construction-and how you can "do It yourself" for        next to nothing-you may want to consult the        following back issues of this magazine ... which can be        ordered (for $3.00 apiece plus $1.00 shipping and        handling per order) from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) ,        P.O.
