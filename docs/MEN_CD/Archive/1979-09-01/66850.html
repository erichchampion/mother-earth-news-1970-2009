                    <p>      <em>Halfway around the world and back again: MOTHER's      U.S.S.R. Tour Report.</em>    </p>        <p>      If you lived in the U.S.S.R. and developed -say -high blood      pressure, early signs of ulcers, a touch of arthritis, or a      persistent cough ... your doctor would probably give you a      prescription for a 28-day ''rest cure". Then, your      polyclinic or your employer would make arrangements for a      free-or extremely inexpensive-visit to a health      spa (one of that nation's hundreds) that specializes in      your particular ailment.    </p>    <p>      You might, for example, spend a month in the lovely old      town of Pyatigorsk (nestled in the foothills of the      Caucasus) where the Czars and their nobles "took the      waters" . . . or, perhaps, you'd end up in the Black Sea      resort of Sukhumi, with warm evenings spent sipping iced      coffee with ice cream on the crowded, friendly, palm-strewn      promenade ... or you could find yourself in one of the      palatial spas nestled among the magnolia, mimosa, and      cypress trees in popular, sophisticated Sochi.    </p>    <p>      According to your problem, you would be assigned a      combination of "natural" cures: These might include      exercise, dance, singing, breathing, walking, swimming,      inhalation, electr ic, light, and/or heat therapies ... mud      or mineral baths ... a special diet ... and, almost      inevitably, you'd be prescribed a precise number of cups of      a certain mineral water to consume each day.    </p>    <p>      Does it do any good? The patients think so, and as one      doctor expressed it: "We wouldn't spend all this time and      money if the system didn't work! "    </p>    <h3>      MOTHER'S READERS IN RUSSIA    </h3>    <p>      A marvelously diverse group of MOTHER's readers (alike only      in their independency, adventurousness, stamina, and good      cheer) recently returned home after spending over three      exciting weeks exploring some of these very health spas, as      well as the metropolises of Moscow and Leningrad ...      exotic, colorful Samarkand ... the Zone of Health in the      Caspian Sea town of Baku ... and the outrageously      hospitable village of Tbilisi in Soviet Georgia. (A couple      from California even cele brated their Georgian-style      wedding in nearby Talavi ... where the feasting, dancing,      and toasting lasted almost eight hours! )    </p>    <p>      And the herbalists who came along on the tour were so      impressed with some of the 4,500 species of plant life      found in the awesome, soaring Caucasian mountains (there      are over 550 wild medicinal plants native to this region!)      that "Herbs and Herbal Medicine" will be the theme of      MOTHER's next tour (in May of 1980) to the U.S.S.R....      which will, once again, be arranged in cooperation with the      Citizen Exchange Corps.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, our next spring's trip won't be      <em>confined</em> to the Caucasus! We'll also travel to      Alma-Ata (near the China border), which is one of the most      beautiful cities in the Soviet Union. Then we'll visit      nearby Issyk-kul, where-years ago-an earthquake      nearly emptied a gigantic lake and left rich soil ... in      which plants such as peonies and delphiniums grow three      times as big as they do <em>anywhere</em> else on Earth!    </p>    <p>      Next, we'll explore the Irkutsk area in Siberia, lands in      which a person could (in season) live (well!) off the wild      foods that grow in profusion in the beautiful forests      surrounding Lake Baikal ... the largest body of fresh water      in the world.    </p>    <p>      The trip will last 21 days and will cost approximately      $2,000 (subject to confirmation). If you'd like to add some      exotic plants to your herb collection or simply gain more      knowledge about the subject, a $100 deposit (which we'll      cheerfully refund up to six weeks before departure) will      hold you a place. Write for more information, or stay tuned      to upcoming issues for further details.    </p>    <h3>      AND THERE'S MORE!    </h3>    <p>      MOTHER has other travel plans for 1980, too. For example,      would you like to check out the "years-ahead-of-us-all"      solar energy developments in Israel? Or-come next      fall-find out about food and energy production in the      People's Republic of China? If so, let us hear from you!      Write to: Mother's Tours, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C.      28739.    </p>
