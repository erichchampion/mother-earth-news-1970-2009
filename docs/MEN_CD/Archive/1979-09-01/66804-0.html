        CLOCKWISE FROM BELOW: The Silver Volt, finely detailed from end to end... Sir Jon Samuel at the wheel of his brainchild... ""Fill 'er up"" with 120- or 240- volt power... Quick-charge batteries and an onboard generator for practicality. ... EAC's vehicle is streamlined, but large enough for passenger comfort... On the road: a 130-mile (maximum) range, a ""top end"" of 70 mph, and a ""Rolls Royce"" ride.
