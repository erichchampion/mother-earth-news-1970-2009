                  <p><strong> KITCHEN GARDEN</strong></p>     			<p>      The crunch that calms.</p>			<h5 id="byline">By Sara Pacher    </h5>    <p>      A few years back, a study of the effects of sounds on      stress revealed that the noises made when chewing crunchy      foods seemed to relieve tension. I can't vouch for that      report, but I know there is a special pleasure in the      crispy crunch of a carrot, and it's especially sweet when      the root is homegrown.    </p>        <p>      As I write this, carrots from the autumn garden stand      upright in a glass on my desk, waiting to be munched while      I contemplate the coming sentence. And even if my nibbling      fails to relieve the stress of an approaching deadline, I'm      still supplying my body with a high dose of vitamin A,      which increases disease-resistance in such moist body      membranes as eyes and throat and helps maintain vision in.      the face of computer-monitor eyestrain. (Vitamin A is also      essential for children's growth and important to the      production of sex hormones.) In addition to supplying more      than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin A,      each raw, low-calorie root provides me with vitamins B, C,      D, E and K, along with beta carotene, which may help ward      off cancer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What to Plant</strong>    </p>    <p>      Some think the carrot is a native of Afghanistan. We know      it's been cultivated in the Mediterranean region for over      2,000 years, and that Asians and Greeks have prized its      medicinal qualities for centuries. About 600 years ago,      <em>Daucus carota</em> spread east to China and north to      Europe. Flemish refugees brought the vegetable to England      during the reign of Elizabeth I, and it accompanied the      first settlers to this continent. But it wasn't until some      100 years ago that French horticulturist Vilmorin-Andrieux      turned the small, white root of this biennial, which      resembles Queen Anne's lace, into the plump, succulent,      brightly colored vegetable we enjoy today.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, about the only carrot varieties found in      seed catalogues were the good-eating Nantes; the short,      stout Chantenay; the hefty Imperator; and the long, slender      Danvers. Today, these have all been improved, and a host of      new hybrids, including carrots with white, yellow, crimson,      or purplish roots, have come on the scene. There are early      and late types, with the time from planting to harvest      ranging from 55 to 80 days. Carrots also come in all sizes      and shapes: fat, slender, medium-sized, round,      finger-length and bite-sized midgets.    </p>    <p>      The taste and texture of a carrot are more likely to depend      on proper cultivation in a good soil than on the choice of      a particular cultivar, but varieties can have special      qualities. For example, Tip Top (a large Nantes) is great      for juicing; Juwarot (a Danvers) has nearly double the      vitamin A content of most carrots; King Midas is disease-      and crack-resistant; thick-shouldered Goldinheart (a      Chantenay) does well in heavy soils and freezes nicely;      Belgium White is especially delicious in salads; Baby      Finger Nantes is excellent for cooking; and Golden Ball      (early, round, two-inch-diameter) is ideal for shallow      soil.    </p>    <p>      In choosing a carrot, it's a general rule to select one      with a short root if your dirt is heavy. These smaller      versions are also best suited for growing in containers.      Carrots, in fact, are among the easiest vegetables to grow,      and the success of your crop will rest almost entirely on      the quality of the soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Where to Plant</strong>    </p>    <p>      The best growing medium for carrots is sandy loam and the      worst is heavy clay, but any plot can be made suitable with      adequate manuring and composting-and carrots thrive      in raised beds. Try using two buckets of compost and two of      leaf mold to each square yard of heavy dirt. Add sand, if      necessary. Though leaf mold can be worked in at planting      time, beds should be composted and manured <em>at least six      months before sowing.</em> Otherwise, your carrots will be      tough, watery, knobby and forked, with many side rootlets.      Too much nitrogen also gives carrots a poor taste. A prime      location for a carrot patch is where a crop, especially of      such light feeders as peas, was heavily manured the year      before.    </p>    <p>      If the soil is acid, add lime to bring the pH to around      6.3. Adequate potash (in the form of greensand, crushed      granite or kelp meal) and phosphate (try soft phosphate,      bone meal or phosphate rock) will insure good flavor.      Incorporating peat into the soil is helpful, too, because,      while the carrot patch should be well drained, it shouldn't      be dry, and peat will both encourage drainage in a clay      soil and hold moisture in a sandy medium.    </p>    <p>      To avoid deformed carrots, dig or plow the patch deeply and      rake thoroughly. Lumps and stones should be removed, using      a garden sieve if necessary.    </p>    <p>      In selecting a plot for your carrot patch, keep the      following in mind: The plants like full sun, but will      tolerate partial shade. They also prefer ground      temperatures between 60°F and 70°F. If the earth is      too warm, roots may be stunted; if too cold, they become      pale and skinny. Heavy mulch will also keep ground      temperatures cool and help retain needed moisture.    </p>    		<p>      <strong>Carrot-Pineapple-Cream Cheese      Salad</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups finely grated carrots</em> <em>2 cups pineapple      chunks, fresh or canned</em> <em>1 or 2 packages cream      cheese</em> <em>1/2 onion, finely grated</em> <em>1      tablespoon lemon juice</em>    </p>    <p>      Mound grated carrots in the center of a dish. Place      pineapple chunks and squares of cheese around carrots.      Sprinkle onions and lemon juice on top of the carrots.      Serve with slices of slightly toasted and buttered whole      wheat or rye bread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Orange-Almond Carrots</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 pound carrots, scraped and cut into 1" pieces</em>      <em>1/2 cup orange juice</em> <em>2 tablespoons honey</em>      <em>1 tablespoon margarine</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon salt</em>      <em>1/4 teaspoon grated lemon rind</em> <em>1/3 cup      slivered almonds</em> <em>1 tablespoon chopped fresh      parsley</em>    </p>    <p>      Steam carrots for 15 to 20 minutes or until tender. Combine      orange juice, honey, margarine, salt and lemon rind in a      saucepan. Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered for 5      minutes. Add carrots, stir in almonds and cook just enough      to heat. Garnish with parsley. Serves 4 to 6.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How to Plant</strong>    </p>    <p>      Because carrots are usually planted as a cool-weather crop,      it's often recommended that they be sown in the very early      spring in temperature climates and in the fall or winter in      subtropical regions. In fact, you can plant your first crop      three weeks before the soil even warms up. To enjoy a long      harvest of fresh carrots. plant again every two to three      weeks. The last temperature-climate planting should be,      depending on the variety, two to three months before the      average date of the first fall frost. Sow enough at this      time to assure a supply of carrots throughout the winter      and into early spring.    </p>    <p>      Carrot seeds are very tiny. (One ounce will sow 100 feet or      more.) Some gardeners broadcast the seeds, but it's easier      to avoid accidentally weeding them out if they are planted      in rows. Put about six seeds to the inch, pinching them      between finger and thumb to control the amount planted.    </p>    <p>      Germination will be slow-usually occurring in 10 days      to three weeks. It helps, then, to mix in quick-sprouting      radish seeds to mark the rows. Harvesting the radishes or      lettuce will provide the carrots with some natural thinning      and keep the soil loose.    </p>    <p>      Cover the seeds with 1/4 to 1/2 inch of loose soil. (In      dryer, warmer places, you can plant a little deeper.)      Carrots need moisture to germinate, so water gently, being      careful not to wash the seeds away.    </p>    <p>      When the tops are about two inches high, start thinning. Be      ruthless, or you'll end up with small, deformed carrots      that often entwine around each other. Besides, you'll enjoy      eating these tender, sweet culls in salads. Continue      thinning until the vegetables are spaced three to four      inches apart.    </p>    <p>      Don't let the carrot bed dry out, and soak it thoroughly      when watering. As the crop matures, though, cut back on the      water to prevent the carrots from cracking. Keep weeds away      with shallow cultivation, and hand-pull any invaders in the      rows themselves, since bruised carrots attract carrot rust      flies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What to Watch For</strong>    </p>    <p>      Many garden books will tell you that carrots have no      significant pests or diseases. This is often true, but      there are some dangers you should know about, and the      carrot rust fly is one of them. Most prevalent in the      Northwest, it looks like a tiny housefly with a dark      green,1/4-inch-long body and yellow head with red eyes. Its      eggs, which it lays on the plants, hatch into whitish      larvae that burrow into the roots, turning them a dark red.      The first aboveground sign is carrot leaves turning a dark      black. Since infestations usually occur in the early      spring, delaying planting until early summer can avoid the      problem. Maggots from a second generation of adult flies      later in the summer seldom cause much damage.    </p>    <p>      The fly is attracted by the carrots' odor, so try      interplanting rows of carrots with rows of onions, which      could deter both the carrot and the onion fly, since the      scent of one crop will cover that of the other. Remember,      too, that thinning releases the aroma of the foliage. Since      the carrot fly is seldom around during the evening, cull at      that time or on a day with a light rain. Crop rotation also      helps to avoid this pest.    </p>    <p>      The carrot worm, the larva of the black swallowtail      butterfly, is a green caterpillar with black stripes and      white or yellow dots that sticks out little orange horns      when threatened. Handpick these in the morning, or use      <em>Bacillus</em> <em>thuringiensis</em> or rotenone.      Handpicking or rotenone will also take care of carrot      weevils, while infestations of aphids can be controlled      with ladybugs, hard hose-sprays, sticky traps, garlic      sprays, wood ashes or garden-quality diatomaceous earth.    </p>    <p>      Wireworms (hard-shelled, jointed, reddish brown and up to 1      1/2 inches long) can be controlled by strewing wood ashes      between the rows.    </p>    <p>      Sandy-soil gardeners may have trouble with nematodes:      microscopic roundworms that make little knots along      rootlets and stunt the carrots. If you have this problem,      dose the soil with healthy humus before your next sowing,      since compost is rich in predatory microorganisms.    </p>    <p>      Leaf blight is among the most common carrot diseases. It      produces white to yellowish spots on leaves (these      discolorations eventually turn brown). It can be remedied      by spraying the plants with a copper-lime mixture or      avoided altogether by preheating the seeds in 126°F      water for 10 minutes or by planting a blight-resistant      variety.    </p>    <p>      Mosaic, which is spread by aphids, mottles leaves with      light to dark shades of green. It can be prevented by      controlling the aphids.    </p>    <p>      Hot, humid weather sometimes brings on vegetable soft rot,      a bacterial disease that discolors the foliage and causes      the roots to become soft, slimy and foul-smelling. (It can      also strike stored carrots, so cull any bruised roots and      make sure the harvested crop is aerated.) Loose,      well-drained soil and crop rotation are the best      preventives.    </p>    <p>      However, the main danger to your carrot crop will not be      insects and diseases, but such larger pests as deer,      gophers, ground hogs and rabbits. A good fence or dog is      your best defense against these animals. Pouches of dog      hair or human hair, or bars of soap hung around the garden,      can also act as deterrents to deer. Rabbits are said to be      turned back by sprinkling wood ashes, garlic powder, chili      powder, ground red pepper or talcum powder about the bed.      (Replenish after rains.) Ground hogs usually have to be      shot or trapped, but you can also plant onions and garlic      around their burrows or lure them away from the garden with      plots of alfalfa or clover, their favorite foods. Plant      castor bean or mole plants to deter gophers-but not      if small children ate around, since these are poisonous.      You can also spray a mixture of one tablespoon of castor      oil and one tablespoon of liquid detergent to a gallon of      water on the ground and plants, use baited traps, or put      chili and garlic powder in the tunnels every week.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How to Harvest and Store</strong>    </p>    <p>      The younger the carrots, the tenderer they'll be. A small      head or crown of orange will appear at the soil line when      the carrots are maturing. If they poke their heads too far      out of the soil, mound dirt or mulch over them to prevent      greening of the shoulders. Pull only those carrots you'll      need, since the roots will stay fresh in the ground for      quite a while.    </p>    <p>      Gather your winter carrots before the first frost. Pick a      day when the soil is moist but the air is dry. You can lift      the carrots with a spading fork, but be careful not to      bruise them, since bruised roots can't be stored. It's      better to harvest by hand, using a trowel if necessary to      loosen the dirt.    </p>    <p>      Properly stored fresh carrots keep well, retain their      flavor and have a higher nutritional value than preserved      ones, so you can simply twist off the leaves and place the      unwashed roots-not touching-between layers of      sand or peat in boxes or plastic trash cans topped with      straw. The containers should be kept in a cool, frost-proof      place. If it's not feasible to keep them indoors, you can      bury your surplus in a straw-lined trench, covered with a      thin layer of dirt.    </p>    <p>      To can your harvest, top, clean, scrape, and cut the roots      into sections. Pack in jars with water and process in a      pressure canner at 10 pounds of pressure for 30 minutes for      quarts, 25 minutes for pints.    </p>    <p>      Freeze carrots as soon as possible after they're pulled.      Choose small specimens, cut off the tops, wipe with a damp      cloth, blanch for two minutes, cool, pat dry, pack, and      freeze. Mature carrots can be scraped, sliced, cut into      cubes and blanched for three minutes before freezing.      They'll add a bright touch to winter soups and stews. But      if you're stressed or up-tight, pull a raw root out of      storage and munch away. You've nothing to lose-and a      lot of nutrition to gain.    </p>
