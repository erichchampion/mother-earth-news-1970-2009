                    <p>      <em>. . . and take</em> full <em>advantage of the      possibilities of today's electronics.</em></p>      <h5 id="byline">by TJ Byers</h5><p>      Though electronics can seem pretty complex to the      uninitiated, learning to use simple circuits (or to copy      more complicated ones) really isn't difficult. Moreover,      that knowledge can help you save a tremendous amount of      time and money while allowing you to accomplish tasks that      might otherwise be impossible. That's why you'll find, in      nearly every issue of MOTHER, one or more useful projects      that require at least a rudimentary low voltage circuit . .      . and those devices are often mounted on what is called a      printed circuit (PC) board.</p>         <p> Furthermore, for over a year now, my electronics articles      have each been accompanied by access information, which has      given a source for reasonably priced, commercially produced      printed circuit boards . . . and I plan to continue that      practice in the future. Nevertheless, some readers may want      to learn how to <em>make</em> such boards, so that they can      complete projects that are shown in this magazine, as well      as start laying out their own electronic devices.      Fortunately, Radio Shack offers a kit that can turn just      about anyone into a designer of printed circuit      boards.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE FINE PRINT</strong><br />      <br />      A printed circuit is actually quite simple (but very      cleverly conceived) in both design and execution. Its basis      is a sheet of insulating material-usually either fiberglass      or phenolic plastic-over which a very thin layer of copper      is bonded. In order to turn the metal surface into a      circuit, a design is placed on the copper . . . and any      unwanted material is removed, using a chemical etching      process.<br />      <br />      To begin, the pattern that the electricity will eventually      follow is drawn on the metal with an ink that's resistant      to the etchant's action. And after the process is      completed, a copper network that duplicates the original      inked design will remain. These thin metal paths serve as      the connecting "wires" for the components that make up the      final product. Now printed circuits may <em>sound</em>      exotic, but the builder who isn't familiar with electronic      construction will find them perfectly suited to his or her      lack of expertise . . . because, once the board's been      properly laid out, there's little chance of making a wiring      error.<br />      <br />      Radio Shack's Printed Circuit Kit (ask for part number      276-1576) contains everything you'll need to make a pair of      PC boards: two 3" X 4-1/2" printed circuit boards, one      resist ink pen, one six-ounce bottle of etchant, a two      ounce bottle of resist ink solvent, a 1/16Â° drill bit,      and a plastic box to serve as the etchant tub. (The boards      come coated with a protective lacquer that must be removed      prior to use by scrubbing with water and an abrasive pad .      . . which is included in the kit.)<br />      <br />      <strong>LAYING OUT A CIRCUIT</strong><br />      <br />      Before you can begin constructing the board, you'll have to      lay out the design. If you're making up your own circuit,      first sketch out the pattern on a piece of paper. When      you're satisfied with your arrangement, simply redraw the      lines on the board with the resist ink pen.<br />      <br />      If you're working from an article, though, it will probably      feature a photograph or drawing of-the board that's needed      to assemble the project. (The picture should be the same      size<br />      <br />      as the board you're going to prepare.) In such a case,      transfer that design to your own board.<br />      <br />      If you have sharp eyes and a steady hand, you may be able      to freehand the circuit, using the photo or drawing as a      guide (personally, I'm not quite good enough to do it this      way). Actually, I find that the task is easier if I place a      sheet of clear plastic over the magazine pattern and trace      the design onto the transparent material. Then I use tape      to hinge the top edge of the plastic to my new copper-clad      board. By drawing on the metal and checking my progress and      accuracy frequently with my see-through overlay, I can      reproduce a pattern pretty faithfully. As an additional      guide, I often use a straight pin to poke a few strategic      holes through the plastic (and into the foil). If you try      this approach, be careful to make punctures only in areas      that will later be removed, to avoid damaging the      circuit.<br />      <br />      When drawing the circuit lines, make absolutely sure that      you lay down a <em>heavy mark</em> with the resist ink pen.      Any breaks or thin spots could permit the etchant to reach      the bare metal. I have the best luck by starting with      small, light strokes . . . then I build the line up,      allowing each layer to dry before adding the next.<br />      <br />      <strong>RUB-ON DECALS</strong><br />      <br />      Yet another way to place a circuit pattern onto a blank      board is with dry transfer decals.<br />      <br />      Radio Shack sells a package of four for under $3.00      (request part number 276-1577). Every sheet has an      assortment of integrated circuit patterns-each with the      proper hole spacings -as well as a selection of straight      lines and curves of different radii.<br />      <br />      To apply a decal, remove its backing and then position the      chosen pattern on the copper-clad board. Next, connect the      components, cut out the desired number of straight lines,      and lay them onto the board in the appropriate locations.      Now, using a ballpoint pen, trace over the circuit paths to      transfer them to the board. Press gently at first,      gradually increasing pressure, to prevent the decal from      distorting or cracking. Finally, burnish the transferred      pattern by laying the backing paper across the design and      rubbing it firmly with the tip of the pen.<br />      <br />      <strong>ETCHING</strong><br />      <br />      Your board is now ready for etching. Pour half the contents      of the etchant bottle into the bottom part of the plastic      box, saving the remainder of the liquid for your next      project. Then put the printed circuit into the tray, face      down, and gently agitate the mixture every so often.<br />      <br />      When you're working with the etchant, it's a good idea to      use tongs or wear gloves. The liquid isn't terribly      dangerous, but it is corrosive and can irritate sensitive      skin. (Besides, it <em>always</em> leaves a horrible      yellowish brown stain on your skin that takes days to wear      off)<br />      <br />      The exact length of time required to remove all the      unwanted copper will depend on the temperature, the amount      of metal to be removed, the frequency of agitation, etc.      But after 20 minutes, you can lift up the board for      inspection. If <em>any</em> exposed copper remains, return      the project to the solution.<br />      <br />      After the board is completely etched, rinse it thoroughly      under cold running water for at least two minutes. The used      liquid should be discarded, but I don't recommend flushing      it down the sink. Again, though the solution isn't very      dangerous, it's probably better left out of our sewage      systems. A decent burial would be a fitting end for      it.<br />      <br />      Now, all that remains is to strip off the resist ink (use      the solvent supplied with the kit), or to remove the      transfer decals. But <em>don't</em> put the solvent in the      etching tray: It'll melt the plastic!<br />      <br />      Mount parts to the finished board by drilling holes where      component leads must pass. Then solder the components in      place, using a <em>small</em> iron to prevent the foil from      lifting off the board. And what if you've made a mistake?      Easy. Open the circuits by scratching them with an      Xacto-type knife .. . and bridge gaps with a short piece of      wire.<br />      <br />      By now, you're probably itching to put your new knowledge      to work, so why not start by building the power-failure      system shown here?<br />      <br />      <strong>MOTHER'S POWER-FAILURE ALARM</strong>    </p>        <p>      Here's a chance to exercise your newly learned skill while      putting together a very use <em>ful</em> <em>device. This      alarm is a simple circuit that monitors your AC      (alternating current) power and alerts you if it's      interrupted. Not only could such a warning save a      freezer</em> <em>full</em> <em>of food from damage, it      might also help you rescue a brood of day-old chicks that      would otherwise freeze to death overnight.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Basically, the AC power (from a cord plugged into a      wall outlet) holds one of the alarm's relays engaged, which      prevents the buzzer from sounding. When the utility power      fails, however, the relay drops out, the contacts close,      and a 9-volt battery supplies power to a warning alarm.      When power is restored, the device automatically resets and      waits for the</em> next <em>power failure.</em>    </p>            <p>      <em>Construction begins (of course) with the production of      a printed circuit board. Using the photo of the pattern      shown here, fabricate a board according to the technique      described in the main article. (The original for this      project was built using only the contents of the Radio      Shack Printed Circuit Kit, so you should have little      trouble duplicating it.)</em><br />      <br />      <em>Once the board is finished, drill a hole through the      center of each of the circular pads with the 1/16" drill      bit. Now, mount and solder all the components to the board,      but watch their orientations carefully. . . a mix up here      could do irreversible damage.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Finally, test the unit by inserting the battery into      its clip and holder. The buzzer should sound, and-when you      plug the alarm into the wall-the noise should stop. If the      buzzer fails to sound, or if it doesn't switch</em>      <em>off</em> <em>when it should, recheck your work far      errors.</em><br />      <br />      <em>With the power-failure alarm plugged in (and a healthy      battery in place), you won't be caught unaware even by a      midnight black</em> <em>out. And, if you'd like to develop      a more ambitious power failure system, you'll find that the      relay is hefty enough to control an emergency lighting      setup, too!</em>    </p>        <p>      For those readers wishing to build the alarm without the      hassle of etching the PC board, Danocinths Inc., Dept.
