                    <p>      <strong>AS MUCH AS 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF WIND SYSTEM      GENERATING CAPACITY</strong> may be installed worldwide by      1990, according to Robin Sacks, an advisor to the United      States House Select Committee on Science and Technology.      Ms. Sacks says that industry sales totaled $39 million in      1980 and grew to $108 million in 1982, with more than 100      companies around the globe actively involved in designing      and/or manufacturing some 200 different wind system      products. She also pointed out, however, that the future      security of the industry depends largely upon whether or      not U.S. firms succeed in bringing the cost of installed      wind power-which now ranges from a scant 7d per kilowatt      hour to a high of 35d-down to consistently low levels that      will be competitive if state and federal tax credits      end.<br />      <br />      <strong>BUYING ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOUSING CAN GET YOU A      BETTER MORTGAGE</strong> in the Denver-Boulder area of      Colorado, thanks to a unique concept that's likely to      spread to other regions . . . called the Home Energy Loan      Program (HELP). For a $100 fee, a potential buyer can get a      complete HELP appraisal of an existing home's energy      consumption, and then use the study (if it's favorable) to      help parlay a larger-than-usual mortgage from any of      several participating lending institutions. Columbia      Savings and Loan Association, for example, normally does      not approve mortgages that would require payments amounting      to more than 26% of the applicant's gross monthly income .      . . but the firm will extend the limit to 30% on      HELP-approved homes. The logic behind the program, of      course, is that a homeowner who pays lower utility bills      can afford higher house payments.<br />      <br />      <strong>GO WITH THE FLOW:</strong> The California Energy      Commission has calculated that adjusting the timing of      traffic signals to eliminate delays or stops at some 20,000      intersections in the state-a project expected to cost about      $40 million-will ultimately save Golden State motorists      $550 million in vehicle operating costs annually . . . and      will conserve some 150 million gallons of gasoline each      year.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>DOES "OINK" MEAN "TURN THE      HEAT DOWN" IN PIG-ESE?</strong> When researchers at the      University of Illinois taught four-week-old piglets to      control the heat in their own pens (the animals were      trained to hit a special radiant-heater switch with their      snouts), the little porkers cut the facility's heating      costs by 53%, compared with a similar setup controlled by a      conventional thermostat. Although many swine breeders      commonly house mont hold piglets in enclosures where the      temperature is kept at 80째F all day-an expensive      practice, but one thought necessary to prevent illness-in a      series of experiments, the porcine subjects consistently      opted for cooler conditions, ranging from an average      nightly low of 60째F between 2:00 and 3:00 AM to an      average high of 80째F from two to three o'clock in the      afternoon.<br />      <br />      <strong>DOWN-TO-EARTH SOLAR HEAT STORAGE:</strong> The      folks in Hatfield, Massachusetts hated to see the summer's      energy absorbed by 60 solar collectors mounted atop their      high school's roof go to waste . . . so they devised a way      to "bury" the surplus calories in a huge (100' -long, 85'      -wide, and 8' -deep) insulated pit for use later in 'the      year. Sun-warmed water is continuously pumped through the      dirt "heat sponge", which was expected-as a result-to reach      and hold an optimum 180째F by the time school opened      this fall. Although not exactly dirt cheap (the project      cost $165,000 . . . nearly two-thirds of which was paid by      the state energy office and by a local utility company),      the unique storage and recovery system should supply as      much as 25% of the school's winter heating needs.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>THE WIND IS BLOWING LAND      PRICES SKY-HIGH</strong> in some regions of California,      where tax incentives and strong air currents-not to mention      federal regulations that require utilities to buy      electricity produced by alternative means-have fostered a      proliferation of "wind farms" (see Energy Flashes, MOTHER      NO. 80) on otherwise "worthless" acreage. Investors eager      to get in on the action are buying desert scrub land and      barren mountain passes-not for the property itself, but for      the wind blowing across it-at prices three or four times      what the turf would've sold for a year or two ago.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>IF YOU USE (OR ANTICIPATE      USING) A WOOD- OR COAL-BURNING APPLIANCE</strong> , you owe      it to yourself to read <strong>and heed</strong> reliable      instructions on the subject. We recommend Jay W. Shelton's      excellent book <strong>Wood Heat Safety</strong> ,      available for $9.95 at most bookstores or, for an      additional $2.00 to cover postage and handling, direct from      the publisher (Garden Way Publishing Company, Dept. TMEN,      Charlotte, Vermont 05445). Another good source of life- and      property-saving information is the government brochure      "Warm up to Wood Safely" (Stock Number 064-000-00016-1),      available for $2.00 postpaid from the U.S. Superintendent      of Documents, Government Printing Office, Dept. TMEN,      Washington, D.C. 20402.<br />      <br />      Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Nunzio Palladino      says that <strong>SABOTAGE AT NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IS      INCREASING</strong> <strong>,</strong> and cites 11      incidents-including such acts as cutting control wires and      dumping metal chips into the lubricating oil of cooling      pumps-that have occurred within the past three years ....      <strong>AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FOR BICYCLES</strong>      <strong>,</strong> designed to accommodate 16 different      gear ratios and to allow riders to change gears without      taking their hands off the handlebars, may be offered by      American bike makers soon .... THE <strong>SOVIET UNION HAS      AN ESTIMATED 5,000 WIND TURBINES IN OPERATION</strong> ,      and plans for additional small and large-scale systems are      under way .... Babcock and Wilcox, the firm that designed      the Unit Two reactor at Three Mile Island, has been granted      $50,000 from the Department of Energy to develop "      <strong>A NOVEL SOLAR THERMAL PROCESS THAT CAN BE USED TO      DESTROY HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL WASTES</strong> ".    </p>
