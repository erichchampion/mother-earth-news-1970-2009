        [1] Marshall Price provides some human scale to aid in gauging the height of his lakeside wind generator. The tower is a section of well casing, and the machinery pivots to face the breeze on a simple lolly axis that prevents 360? rotation. [2] The wind plant's alternator and step-up drive are salvaged automotive components, and the governing hub and blades are home built. The weathervane indicates that the prevailing winds are, in general, westerly.[3] As a means of over speed control in strong winds, Marshall designed his tail frame so it could be folded parallel with the blades if necessary. In this partially furled position, the tail vane directs the rotor into the wind at an angle, thus shunting off much of its force. (41 The storage bank is a combination of 2- and 6-volt batteries wired in a series-parallel circuit to achieve 12 volts overall. An inverter changes the direct current into AC for use in the house
