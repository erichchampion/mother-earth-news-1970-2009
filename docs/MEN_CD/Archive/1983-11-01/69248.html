                <p>      <em>With a little planning and preparation in the weeks to      come, you could be . . .</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Phebe Whitehead</h5>            <p>      Have you ever wondered where pet shops get all those      adorable little nose-twitching bundles of fur they sell for      inflated prices at Easter every year? Well, you can be sure      the critters aren't supplied by some giant "hareticultural"      corporation! Instead, they're bred by small-scale backyard      rabbit farmers . . . folks who are "in business" to produce      meat for family use or for sale, but who've also learned to      adjust their stock's winter breeding calendars to fill the      strong demand of the Peter Cottontail rush.<br />      <br />      The prime time for selling Easter bunnies is, of course,      during the weeks just before that springtime holiday. But      I've found that a lot of people will still be buying      longears up to a couple of weeks after the last dyed egg      has been eaten. (Usually, these late buyers are parents      responding to the pleas of their children who have seen the      small bundles of fluff in the homes of friends . . . and      have then waged a successful campaign to get one of their      own.)<br />      <br />      A backyard producer may easily sell a hundred young      carrot-munches during the Easter season at $5.00 to $10.00      or more each (that works out to a profit that ranges from      $3.00 to as much as $7.00 apiece). And if-like me-you're      already raising rabbits for meat and fur, this business is      a particularly cost- and labor-efficient endeavor . . .      because it takes little extra time, space, and feed to care      for the additional animals once you're set up and      accustomed to the chores.<br />      <br />      (Normally, I can provide routine care for 20 breeders and      their numerous offspring in a scant ten minutes a day, and      that includes all the feeding, watering, and cage cleaning      chores.) And if you're not already a bunny breeder, now's      as good a time as any-and better than most!-to get started.      So read on, and I'll tell you how I've turned enjoyable      "work" into a sizable increase in my yearly income.<br />      <br />      <strong>SMALL BREEDS = BIG SALES</strong><br />      <br />      Since the larger bunnies that are normally raised for their      meat and fur-such as Californian and New Zealand      rabbits-are not the most suitable for sale as cuddly      companions, you may want to add a new variety or two to      your hutches. Though it's true that some of the "meat"      animals do show up in pet stores in late March and early      April, buyers recently have become aware that there are      miniature breeds that make more appealing pets, eat less,      and require smaller cages than the usual sorts. As a      result, the "mini" rabbits bring a premium price when      wholesaled to pet outlets . . . while the larger hoppers      often have to be sold at a discount and are sometimes      rejected outright.<br />      <br />      The most popular of these smaller breeds is the Dutch,      which is a medium-sized animal weighing four to seven      pounds at maturity, and the Hobbit-sized Netherlands Dwarf      . . . a very little rabbit (two to four pounds when full      grown) with short ears and big, calf like eyes. (Beware of      the Polish Dwarf: It's a laboratory breed that has ears so      short that it looks more like a guinea pig than an Easter      bunny.)<br />      <br />      <strong>LEAPING INTO</strong> <strong>THE RABBIT      TRADE</strong><br />      <br />      And exactly where does one get starter stock for these      smaller, less common breeds? Well, it's no problem to      locate Dutch and Dwarf types at rabbit and livestock      auctions and shows. Check the ads in your local newspapers,      too . . . and look for signs when driving past nearby farms      and urban homesteads. Although auctions are often the least      expensive sources, you'll need to know which breed      characteristics to look for . . . and be willing to spend      several evenings searching for likely animals in this      way.<br />      <br />      Weaned bunnies-called "juniors" by professional rabbit      farmers-are often better bets than mature animals that      <em>might</em> be up for sale because they've been tried      and found lacking in breeding ability. If you do buy      juniors, make sure that they'll be at least six months old      by the middle of December and thus able to mate in time to      meet the Easter demand. It's always smart to purchase new      stock well in advance of any planned breeding season so      that the animals can be quarantined, checked for disease,      and-if necessary-treated to prevent infections from      spreading through your entire rabbitry.<br />      <br />      When planning the breeding schedule, keep in mind that      another major advantage of the smaller varieties over the      larger-in addition to their minimal demands for food and      space-is that they are marketable for a longer time. A      Netherlands Dwarf or Dutch will stay small and appealing      for weeks longer than will one of the rangy meat critters,      allowing more than one litter per doe to be sold at the      peak marketing time.<br />      <br />      And that brings us to the question of when your animals      should be sold. Standard rabbit farming know-how recommends      weaning kitlings at <em>eight</em> weeks, but Easter      bunnies are usually sold when they're only <em>four to      six</em> weeks old (and they seem to do just fine anyway).      You see, visual appeal is the biggest single selling point      in the rabbits-for-pets business, and (although none should      be sold before they're three weeks old) there's no doubt      that the younger a bunny is, the cuter-and therefore more      marketable-it will be.<br />      <br />      Of course, you should exercise restraint and good judgment      in deciding on selling age. I know of one pet store that      buys fast growing New Zealands from a meat-rabbit raiser      when the youngsters are only three weeks old. Then, when      the animals have grown too large to catch the fancy of      buyers, the shop owner exchanges them for <em>more</em>      little ones. In my opinion, however, weaning rabbits at      three weeks is unfair . . . to the customers and      (especially!) to the furry babies.<br />      <br />      <strong>BREEDING CALENDAR</strong><br />      <br />      Given three bits of information, you can compute an      accurate breeding calendar and be sure that those big-eared      fuzz balls will be ready for the pet market: [1] the date      on which Easter will fall '(for 1984, it's April 22), [2]      the gestation period for rabbits (one month), and [3] the      minimum age at which you're willing to wean and sell the      springtime litters (personally, 1 don't like to market the      kitlings when they're less than five weeks old).<br />      <br />      Since we're coming up on the time when you'd want to start      the breeding cycle for Easter 1984, let's take a look at      what you'll need to do (and when).<br />      <br />      <strong>December 15, 1983:</strong>Breed all your does so      they'll give birth (the word is "kindle" in rabbit raiser      jargon) around January 15, 1984. The litters from this      first breeding will be useful for early-season sales,      starting late in February. The females that bear from this      mating should be bred again on February 5 . . . the little      cottontails produced from this mating will be of optimum      age for Easter sales. (And yes, <em>I know</em> that gives      the mamas only three weeks from giving birth to rebreeding,      but I guess that's why we have the cliche "multiplying as      fast as rabbits"!)<br />      <br />      The females that failed to produce litters on January 15      (after the first mating) should be given another honeymoon      with the bucks on January 20 so that they'll kindle around      February 20. Then, on April 1, the resulting kits will be      six weeks old . . . a prime age for early Easter sales. And      you might breed these does a third time on February 5, just      in case the second mating didn't prove any more fruitful      than the first.<br />      <br />      s <strong>February 5, 1984:</strong> Breed the mothers that      produced litters on January 15 . . . and then rebreed them      a week later, in case of "misses". The bunnies born around      March 7 will be five weeks old on the weekend of Palm      Sunday (April 15, 1984). These will be your frontline      Easter babies for selling either to pet shops or directly      to the public.<br />      <br />      <strong>February 25:</strong> Once more, try the does that      didn't produce earlier. The little ones that will probably      result from this mating will be five weeks old by the first      and second weeks after Easter, which is about as late as      you can hope to sell to this market.<br />      <br />      <strong>MATCHMAKING</strong><br />      <br />      In order to produce two litters per doe for the Easter      market, I usually give some of my furry females      <em>several</em> trips to the bridal suite. Most lady      rabbits don't need that much of an opportunity to start      bearing, though, and the majority of mine have no trouble      producing two litters apiece in time for the holiday.<br />      <br />      Here's how I handle the matchmaking: I simply carry a      female to the cage of whichever buck best matches her color      and markings, and leave them alone together for about half      an hour. After doing this in the morning, I repeat the      procedure in the afternoon of the same day, and maybe      reintroduce them a third time the following morning . . .      to assure large litters.<br />      <br />      It's a good idea to try to get a variety of colors and      markings in both the Dutch and Dwarf breeds, because-like      all consumers-bunny buyers enjoy having choices. The Dutch      is most frequently black, but other typical shades include      gray, chocolate, and a beautiful golden blond. Netherlands      Dwarfs display several colors, but they're never marked      with the white shoulders that are rather common in the      Dutch.<br />      <br />      An especially interesting pattern appears on the Siamese      Dwarf, in which the "points" (nose, ears, and feet) have      darker markings than the rest of the body.<br />      <br />      It takes experience and experimentation to be able to      select parents that will produce offspring of a certain      shade or pattern. Some hues-such as black in the Dutch are      dominant, while others are genetically "delicate". Crossing      a pair with the latter coloration may take the babies      straight back to the ticked brown of wild hares. A few of      these will sell, but probably <em>only</em> a few. So, cull      a doe that produces too many wild-colored young . . . or at      least find a different mate for her, to improve the      appearance of her litters.<br />      <br />      Dutch/Dwarf mixes usually result in intermediate-sized      offspring with rather uninteresting markings. I seldom      attempt this cross, since the rabbits that will be produced      are less marketable than would be either of the parent      breeds.<br />      <br />      And, when you're using high-intensity production cycles      like the one outlined here, it's always wise to keep a      close watch when does are ready to kindle. Occasionally, a      kit is born on the wire instead of in the nest, or is      dangerously placed underneath the mother. If you're      Johnny-on-the-spot, such babies can be saved.<br />      <br />      Keep in mind, too, that-when you're caring for the females      that "catch" the initial time around and then again during      the second breeding cycle-it's best to remove the first      litter a few days before the next is born. This gives the      mother a bit of a rest and allows you to build a fresh      kindling nest in her cage.<br />      <br />      <strong>HEALTH THREATS</strong><br />      <br />      It's important to watch for disease during the heavy      production season. A rabbit with the "sniffles" may not      just have a cold: It could have a viral infection. And a      bunny that has diarrhea (especially if the animal makes a      sloshing sound when picked up and shaken gently) may not      merely have an "upset tummy". It could have      <em>enteritis,</em> which is serious and contagious, and      can cause the rabbit to lose weight suddenly, acquire rough      fur, and spend all its time before dying with its front      paws immersed in its water dish.<br />      <br />      My rule is that any animal that seems even a      <em>little</em> sick probably won't survive the stress of      adjusting to a new home, and therefore should <em>not be      sold!</em><br />      <br />      <strong>THIS LITTLE BUNNY</strong> <strong>WENT TO      MARKET</strong> . . .<br />      <br />      There are three ways to sell your Easter hoppers, but only      two of them are really profitable. The first financially      wise marketing scheme is to wholesale your young lettuce      lovers to pet shops. Or you can sell them directly to the      public. Then, although it has considerably less moneymaking      potential, the third possibility is to hawk your leftovers      at livestock auctions.<br />      <br />      Pet stores buy most of their bunnies during the two weeks      before Easter, so make a list of all the shops within a      comfortable traveling distance, and go visit them      <em>early.</em> Tell the owners what breeds, ages, colors,      and quantities you can provide. (I've found it a good      sales-clincher to bring along a few sample juniors in an      attractive carrier so that the storekeeper or manager can      inspect the animals in advance.) When you make your sales,      deliver only healthy rabbits that will please both the      owner of the store and his or her customers. That way,      you'll be assured of getting repeat business, come      <em>next</em> spring.<br />      <br />      To spread your own brand of Easter cheer by selling your      big-eared babies directly to the public, place an ad in the      local newspaper . . . preferably on the weekend before the      eggs-and bonnets holiday. This will likely bring customers      in droves, particularly if they've already checked the pet      stores and are aware that you're selling your animals for      about half the usual price. (In my part of Maryland, the      average retail outlet charges between $12 and $20 for      Dutches and Netherlands Dwarfs.)<br />      <br />      Be aware that when you sell direct, you'll have to take on      some of the chores that otherwise would be handled by the      pet shop. For one thing, people often want to know the      gender of their new pet ("Is it a Charlie or a Charlene?").      To sex a very young rabbit, hold the squirming youngster in      your right hand, perhaps by the loose skin of the back if      the bunny scratches vigorously, and feel around the      reproductive area with the thumb and forefinger of your      left hand. A female has a long, line like opening running      parallel to the length of her body, while a boy baby has an      opening that protrudes in the form of a small circle. (The      difference becomes much plainer as the animals      mature.)<br />      <br />      I try not to bore my customers with a lot of unwanted      advice on caring for rabbits, but I do make a practice of      recommending against buying two males and keeping them in      the same cage, since-by the time they're five months      of-they'll doubtless be slugging it out!<br />      <br />      Merchandising requires the seller to provide carry-home      packaging, as hardly any off-the street shoppers will bring      along boxes. So keep a good supply of supermarket cartons      on hand, and package up some pellet food in plastic      Ziploc-type bags (to sell at a reasonable profit). By doing      so, you'll increase your income a little, and your buyers      will be grateful for this "starter food" . . . particularly      because many sales are made on weekends and evenings, when      I feed stores are closed.<br />      <br />      Since Easter is an occasion for surprise gift giving in      some families, people may call on the phone and ask you to      "hold" little Mr. or Miss Cottontail until the holiday      rolls around. I don't provide that service unless I know      and trust the caller. However, I do let a customer pay in      advance and pick up the bunny the day before Easter. That      requires having a good system to prevent my selling the      same critter twice, though. (Tying color-coded ribbons      around their necks works well for me.)<br />      <br />      <strong>. . . AND THIS LITTLE</strong> <strong>BUNNY STAYED      HOME</strong><br />      <br />      After Easter you may watt to breed rcplacement animals for      your rabbitry . . . and, since you could have an      opportunity to sell a few fuzzy-tails throughout the year      to retail outlets that have a slow but steady demand for      pet hoppers, it doesn't hurt to have a few little ones on      hand at all times.<br />      <br />      If you've been feeding commercial pellets during the early      spring (to promote maximum growth in the baby bunnies), you      can now ease up, supplementing that feed with the garden      weeds that become so plentiful at this time of year. Later,      summer hay will lend more variety to your "herd's"      menu.<br />      <br />      When the brisk activity of the spring holiday season is      over, consider culling your breeding stock to assure better      production next year. Does should be replaced if they      didn't take proper care of their litters or if they didn't      produce enough kitlings. Poorly performing bucks should      also be removed from your breeding crew. At this stage of      the game, well-kept records come in handy . . . even if      they're as minimal as notebook listings of which does were      mated to which bucks when, how many babies each mother      kindled, and how many she raised successfully to weaning      age.<br />      <br />      I have a fairly large-scale rabbitry, and began raising      bunnies for the Easter market more than a half-dozen years      ago. I've found this an easy source of extra homestead      income, with little cost or labor required above what I      normally do to maintain my meat-and-fur animals. And what's      proven to be even more rewarding than the extra dollars I      bring in this way each spring is the excitement and joy I      see in the faces of my customers-young <em>and</em>      old-when they hold their new pets for the first time.<br />      <br />      In fact, beyond the profit motive, simply raising and      selling these gentle, lovable creatures is a great way to      experience-and share with others-the joys of spring.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For a brief but concise overview of      professional rabbit farming, see the article "Rabbits" on      page 18 of MOTHER NO. 15 (turn to page 48 for back issue      ordering information).
