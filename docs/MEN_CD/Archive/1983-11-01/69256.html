                <h5 id="byline">by James R. Hall</h5>		<p>      <em>You don't need a fine workshop to build these      problem-solving projects!</em><br />      <br />      You say you're up to your boot tops in cans, cartons,      bottles, and jars of food . . . because there's no place in      your kitchen to store them all? You tell me you need some      shelves . . . maybe an attractive, inexpensive wall rack to      take care of the clutter? You say <em>you'd like</em> to      build one yourself, but you have few tools, little      carpentry experience, and <em>no</em> workbench? Is that      what's bothering you, friend? Well, buck up, because we      recently faced that same situation at our house!<br />      <br />      With the pantry filled to bursting, we needed more kitchen      storage space. The wall rack that I found myself trying to      design had to meet the usual criteria of being reasonably      eye appealing and low in cost, and-in addition-it needed to      be: (1) I strong enough to support 60 or 70 pounds of food,      (2) built with a minimum of equipment (and skill), and (3)      constructed right on the kitchen table . . . because I had      no other indoor work area, and the temperature outside was      -15Â°F.<br />      <br />      However, I was able to overcome <em>all</em> of those      handicaps . . . by using a technique I call "kitchen-table      woodworking". It's simple, clean, and can save a lot of      work because it allows the would-be builder to take      advantage of two factors: (1) Preshaped molding is readily      available from virtually any lumber company, and [2]      millwork shops, and many lumberyards, will cut that wood to      size (and do so with great accuracy) for a small fee. The      design I worked out was successful, and-I was glad to find      proved easy to adapt to numerous <em>other</em> projects .      . . all of which required nothing more than molding (cut to      whatever length I needed), professional wood glue, and a      sturdy work surface.</p>         <p><strong>A WALL-HUNG CAN RACK</strong><br />      <br />      To begin making my shelf, I measured the available space in      my kitchen and worked up a basic design. The can holder      would be 3' vide, 4' tall, and approximately 3" deep, with      eight shelves. Because the rack's 3" depth would      accommodate regular cans but not the larger bottles and      boxes we also needed to store, I decided to extend the two      bottom shelves, making these 4" deep.<br />      <br />      Preshaped molding is straight and smooth, and can be      purchased in various sizes and configurations. For example,      three types that are generally available in my area are      <em>parting stop</em> (1/2" X 3I4"), <em>lattice (1/8"      X</em> 1-I/2"), and <em>banister</em> (3I4" X 3/4"), all of      which come in lengths of 14' or less. <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE:      Molding names and specifications often vary from one region      to another, so the amateur woodworker should learn what's      available locally, and plan accordingly.) To</em> build my      shelf, I ordered 72' of parting stop cut into 3' lengths      (three pieces per shelf for eight shelves), and 24' cut      into 4' lengths (three pieces per side for two sides). In      addition, I purchased two 3' lengths (for shelves) and a      pair of 10" strips (for side pieces) to construct the      extended bottom shelves. By having these trimmed to size at      the lumberyard, I was able to be sure that the lengths were      all exactly the same.<br />      <br />      Once I got the wood home, I cleared the kitchen table and      set it up for working by drawing a right-angle grid along      one side and across one end, and marking off lines in 2"      increments. Then, using these scribes as guides, I laid      down the first two 4' side pieces. Next, I positioned the      3' top and bottom shelf sections (see Fig. 1). When      everything was perfectly square, I lifted up one end of a      shelf piece and very carefully placed a fat drop of wood      glue underneath . . . to secure it to the side piece on      which it rested. I repeated this operation on all four      corners, readjusting the squareness as necessary, and      "clamped" the corners by the old-fashioned gravity method:      laying a second strip of wood next to the ones being glued      and placing a heavy book on top of the joints.<br />      <br />      After taking a 15-minute break to allow the adhesive to set      up, I marked the positions for the remaining shelves. To      accommodate larger boxes and cans, I measured 8-1/2 inches      up my side piece from the bottom shelf, Pod made a pencil      mark. A 3/4" space followed that, to allow for the second      shelf's molding. When I marked off another 8-1/2" space and      a second 3/4" one, I knew where to put the two shelves that      would hold the bigger items. And, since I wanted the      remaining racks to hold only regularsized cans, I made them      each 5" high, again leaving a 3/4" space between each one      for the molding strips.<br />      <br />      Next, I put a drop of glue in the middle of every 3/4"      space, and positioned the remaining shelves so that each      one was exactly centered inside the marks. To weight down      the shelf pieces while the glue set, I laid two 4' moldings      down the center of the rack, spaced 6 inches apart, and put      several heavy books on top (as shown in Fig. 2). 1 removed      the books and loose molding 15 minutes later, put a drop of      glue on each end of every shelf strip, and laid down the      second layer of side pieces. To do so, I simply eyeballed      where the glue should go, then made my final adjustments by      setting two soup cans against each first-layer shelf and      nudging the corresponding second-layer shelf up against      them, insuring that the two layers were perfectly aligned      (see Fig. 3). The third and (partial) fourth layers were      added in the same manner as was the second.<br />      <br />      When all the parts had been assembled and glued, I lightly      sanded the outside edges and rubbed the rack with a      penetrating oil stain. Finally, I mounted it on the wall by      attaching four angle irons to the wall studs and hanging      the rack on them.<br />      <br />      The can shelf served without mechanical fasteners of any      kind for two years, but when my little daughter grew large      enough to begin crawling, exploring, <em>and</em> grabbing      hold of things, I drilled small holes in each joint of the      rack and drove in nails for added security.    </p>        <p>      <strong>ONE FOR ALL</strong><br />      <br />      The kitchen-table woodworking method is easy and versatile,      and all my other projects have followed the same basic      system. Once I decided on the dimensions, I bought the      molding, had it cut to size (or cut it myself, if there      were only a few pieces involved), and glued it together.      And, although the can rack <em>was</em> moderately      expensive at $18.37, many of my smaller projects were real      bargains. For instance, I spent only $1.40 for a spice      rack, $1.15 for a knife rack, and-excluding the glass      top-$3.65 for an end table. All in all, I couldn't be      happier with my woodworking technique. I take a lot of      pride in having built things that we need . . . and in      having paid for the "expensive" can rack with the profits      from two others that I made and sold!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The author will mail interested readers      complete plans for all the projects mentioned: Send $3.00      to James R.
