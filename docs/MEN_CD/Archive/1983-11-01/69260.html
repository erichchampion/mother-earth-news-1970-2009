                <h5 id="byline">by Lawrence A. Jackson</h5><p>      Here's a worthwhile project for anyone whose world has      begun to look dull and "ordinary"!</p>        <p>      Ever since 1816, when Sir David Brewster invented the      kaleidoscope, this plaything has fascinated people of all      ages with its dazzling displays of color and light. Using      mirrors to reflect reflections (think about that!), the      optical curiosity creates a seemingly infinite variety of      symmetrical and geometrical patterns.<br />      <br />      But unfortunately, even though these instruments are      enjoying something of a resurgence in popularity these      days, it's difficult to find a really well-made      kaleidoscope at an affordable price. For the most part,      commercial models are either shabbily constructed (the      cheap, dime-store variety) or outrageously expensive (the      ultra deluxe, handmade, crafts-boutique types).<br />      <br />      To avoid having to make a choice between those two      unsatisfactory alternatives, I decided to make my own      kaleidoscope. A few hours later-after using only scrap (or      low-cost) materials and some ordinary hand tools I'd put      together a fine little mirrored viewer that performs just      as impressively as most of the better store-bought models.      In fact, my creation is <em>superior</em> to them in at      least one important way: It's a dual-optic device. That is,      you can use it with bits of colored glass or plastic to      create classic kaleidoscopic patterns . . or you can point      the tube at a 90° angle to any object-a bumblebee, a      street sign, or whatever-to produce unique designs from the      world around you.    </p>    <h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>        <p>      Four major components make up my kaleidoscope:<br />      <br />      <em>[1] A viewing tube:</em> For this, I used a 13" length      of 1-1/2" PVC pipe (which has an outer diameter of 1-5/8").      You could use cardboard tubing of the same diameter      instead, but I chose PVC because it's inexpensive, easy to      find, and very durable (cardboard kaleidoscopes tend to get      soggy in the rain!).<br />      <br />      [2] <em>Mirrors or other reflective material:</em> These,      of course, are at the heart of any kaleidoscope. To      reproduce my version, you'll need three 1" X 12" strips of      mirror and another piece (for the reflector component      described below) measuring 2" X 2-3/8". You can recycle an      old mirror for this purpose (use a good glass cutter-and      great care-when doing so). Or you can buy the material from      a glass or tile shop (chances are you'll have to purchase a      12" square-the minimum size many stores stock-and either      cut the pieces yourself or have the storekeeper do      it).<br />      <br />      Now, place the three I " strips together, long edge to long      edge, to form a triangular column (with the shiny surfaces      facing in <em>ward).</em> Wrap the joined mirrors firmly      with masking (or duct) tape, and slip the assembly into the      PVC pipe. If the mirrors slide easily in and out of the      tube, pad the outside of the wrapped glass with additional      tape until the fit is snug but not tight.<br />      <br />      When you look into your yet-to-be completed design-maker,      it'll seem as though you're peering through an almost      circular tunnel full of reflected triangles. And;      regardless of what you place in front of the viewer to      produce color or texture, this repeating pattern will      always be the core o1 your scope's displays. (Incidentally,      you can also make a model that casts <em>square</em>      facets, by taping four 7/8" X 12" mirror strips together at      right angles to produce a boxlike rather than      triangular-insert.)<br />      <br />      As you gaze through the scope, you may notice that it's      hard to focus your eyes simultaneously on both the object      and the reflections if the thing you're viewing is      relatively distant from the end of the pipe. To solve this      problem, you need to bring the object closer to the inner      mirrors . . . and that's the job of the next      component.<br />      <br />      [3] <em>The reflector:</em> This is the "extra" part that      gives this toy its ability to be used as a dualoptic      kaleidoscope. When I worked on this component (see Fig. 1)      for <em>my</em> viewer, I started by cutting a block      measuring 2" X 2-1/2" X 21/2" from an old chunk of 2" X 4"      lumber (those were the stock's <em>true</em> dimensions).      But the fact is, this is one of those cases where you can      likely make do with whatever wood you have on hand.<br />      <br />      (EDITOR'S NOTE: For example, MOTH ER's woodworkers-lacking      a piece of "honest" 2" X 4" lumber-improvised by cutting      two 21/2" lengths of commercial 2 X 4 (which actually      measures 1-1/2" X 3-1/2') to a uniform 2-1/4" width, and      then gluing the two back to back to produce a block that      was 2-1/4" X 2-1/2" X 3" (see Fig. 2) . . . a piece      somewhat larger than the one the author used, but      which-when fitted with a correspondingly bigger mirror-was      perfectly acceptable.<br />      <br />      Once you've cut the block to size, bore a 15/8"-diameter      hole at least 1/4" into the wood, as shown in Fig. 1. It's      best to use a drill with a plug-cutter bit for this job, so      chat you can use the resulting cut-out disk when making the      scope's eyepiece. (A spade bit will drill a fine cavity,      too, but won't give you a ready-made plug.)<br />      <br />      Now, saw a triangular section out of the block (see Fig.      1), first cutting straight down to intersect the      hole-opening the "inside" end of that bore-ending about      1/4" from the bottom of the block. Then make another cut to      form a 45 ° incline from the base of the perpendicular      "wall" to the top of the block.<br />      <br />      Next, glue the 2" X 2-3/8" mirror (or whatever size      reflector is appropriate to the dimensions of your base) to      the incline. Fit the completed component to one end of the      tube (you might have to file or sand the wood or the pipe      to make the parts compatible), and fashion an eyepiece for      the other end. If you used a hole cutter when you were      making the base, drill a 1/4" opening into the center of      the left over plug. If you didn't, bore a 1/4" cavity into      a 1-1/2"diameter PVC pipe cap. Then slip the plug into      place and fasten it with brads (in the case of a wooden      eyepiece) or glue (if you used a PVC cap).<br />      <br />      When you've done that, take another look through your      viewer. As you can see, you've created an instrument that      produces a dazzling multifaceted image of . . . well, of      whatever you choose to peek at. To give your kaleidoscope      its second dual-optic property the ability to create      kaleidoscopic designs from bits of colored glass and      such-you'll need to make another simple attachment.<br />      <br />      [4] <em>The object tray:</em> This is nothing more than a      block of wood, with a "window" in it, which rests atop the      reflector and holds items for viewing. If you're making      your scope to the same dimensions as mine, take a 2" X      2-I/2" piece of 1/4" plywood and using a coping or      jigsaw-cut a rectangular area out of the piece, as shown in      Fig. 1. Then glue or tape a 2" X 21/2" piece of stiff,      clear plastic (such as acetate film) over one side of the      opening, and-presto!--you'll have the final component for      your kaleidoscope.<br />      <br />      To hold the tray in place-but also make it easily      removable-all you have to do is tape it to the reflector,      or wrap a rubber band around the two parts . . . or, to      produce a more deluxe setup (as well as one that is more      attractive), work out some kind of arrangement that uses      strips of self adhering fabric fasteners. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: As the photos and Fig. 2 show, we made the window for      our object tray by drilling a 1-5/8"-diameter hole in the      area that would be directly over the mirror. We then glued      self-adhering fasteners to the underside of the tray and to      the top of the reflector, in order to "marry" the two      components.]</em><br />      <br />      Of course, the patterns your kaleidoscope produces will be      determined by the kinds of things you place in the tray . .      . so have fun experimenting with various objects. For      "classic" scope designs, use bits of colored glass,      plastic, or aquarium gravel. But don't let your imagination      stop there: Paper clips, flower petals, safety pins, dried      peas or beans, and "alphabet" macaroni are just a few      examples of ordinary household items that can be elevated      to the realm of the extraordinary when viewed through your      scope.<br />      <br />      Incidentally, you may want to affix a clear plastic flap      over the other side of the tray's window, to keep the      objects from falling out. And if you come up with a      particularly pleasing combination of items, you might elect      to attach the cover permanently . . . and then make a      <em>second</em> tray for temporary displays.<br />      <br />      I think you'll find, as you explore your viewer's      potential, that the instrument is capable of producing an      all but endless array of patterns and color schemes. That's      why, in fact, kaleidoscopes have been used for many years      as design tools in the carpet and textile industries. But      perhaps the <em>real</em> value of Sir David Brewster's      invention is its inherent ability simply to entertain      people, and to remind us that beauty can be found even in      many seemingly "commonplace" things . . . if only we take      the time to look for it.    </p>
