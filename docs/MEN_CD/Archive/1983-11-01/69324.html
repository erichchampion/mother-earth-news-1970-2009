                    <p>      <em>This cut-and-paste plaything might just be the best      Christmas bargain yet.</em><br />      <br />      Paperboard toys were around long before cereal boxes and      comic books made them popular. But the old "cut, fold, and      tuck flap A into slot B" routine needn't be limited to      tabletop trinkets that are likely to disintegrate at a      child's enthusiastic touch. In fact, at one time, real      rough-and-tumble playthings-such as the roadster you see      here-were commonly made from cardboard . . . and were quite      able to endure the punishment dished out by an earlier (and      maybe even rowdier!) generation.</p>        <p>      None of this was lost on research staffer Dennis      Burkholder, who's always been fascinated by paper art . . .      and by things costing very little (or no) money. So, armed      with a corrugated cardboard box (the sort used to ship      major appliances), some wood scraps, a small saw, four      half-liter plastic bottles, a utility knife, a pencil, a      yardstick, a staple gun, and some white glue (Elmer's      Glue-All works fine, but Franklin Titebond does seem to dry      more rapidly), our trusty craftsman set out to build a      next-to-no-cost working toy that anyone could      duplicate.<br />      <br />      If you could feel the sturdiness of the finished product      and heft its nine-pound weight, we think you'd agree that      Dennis achieved his goal . . . and, since he's already done      the difficult design work, all you have to do is scale up      the patterns in the accompanying diagram and transfer them      to your own salvaged sheets of cardboard. The rest will be,      like the cereal-box toys, mostly a cut, fold, and paste      proposition.    </p>                    <p>      OK, so you've laid out your two 48" X 60" corrugated      sheets, outlined the car's various parts on them as      indicated, and cut the pieces from the paper panels. Your      next task is to glue the wheel disks together-in sets of      four each-and put them aside to dry. Now, take your main      frame section and fold it along the dotted lines, thereby      forming a square tube. (Remember to cut out the openings      that will later accommodate the square axle      supports.)<br />      <br />      This central frame is bolstered-in the middle and at both      ends-with 3/4" X 5-3/8" X 6-1/2" wooden stiffeners, and      further braced with two (3/4" X 3/4" X 7" and 3/4" X 3/4" X      10") wooden stays at the seam. (The job will be easier if      you secure the cardboard joint with tape and then staple      the stays in place, with the central stiffener between.)      The end boards can also be fastened along the top and sides      of the frame, but do leave them unstapled until you're      ready to actually fit the body in place.<br />      <br />      Our little runabout's axle supports are, like the frame,      tubular members capped with wood. (Dennis used      2-5/8"-square pieces of 2 X 4, each with a 3/4" hole      drilled through its center.) Once the plugs are positioned      and stapled, you can slip the supports into the frame      openings and glue them in place.<br />      <br />      The next part to be installed is the body itself. But      before you fold it to shape, take the time to cut some 3/4"      X 3/4" wooden<br />      <br />      stays that are long enough to surround the axle support      openings, then do the same for the top and side edges of      the front and rear body panels. With that done, slip the      formed body over the completed chassis and glue the stays      to the axle housings, then cement and staple the grille and      tail panels into position. (Be sure to slide the tabs      attached to those two pieces between the bottom of the main      frame and the end stiffeners before you glue . . . and go      on to finish fastening the lower face of the frame.)<br />      <br />      The seat back is made simply by folding that component and      gluing its broad tab to the top of the frame. Next,      strengthen the sides of the cockpit by bending the lips      into the cab and cementing them to the inside of the body.      At this point, fold up the windshield . . . and glue, then      bolt, it to the top of the body at a point just forward of      the cockpit. (Here, 1/4" X 1/2" fasteners with flat washers      will do fine.) Now, the dashboard panel can be glued      between the forward edge of the cockpit and the top of the      frame below.<br />      <br />      Each of the four fenders is attached to the body with tabs      that are passed through slots and glued from behind. Once      those wheel guards are in place, you can cement the      overlaps at the fenders' bends to give them additional      strength. (On the other hand, the front and rear bumpers      are not tabbed: They're simply glued and stapled to the      grille and tail panels.)<br />      <br />      Dennis' tiny car actually rolls along . . . not on its      cardboard wheels, but on furniture swivel casters. To      attach these components, drill holes into the lower edges      of the wooden caps at the ends of the axle supports (making      sure the holes are of a diameter and depth compatible with      the casters you're planning to use), and push the rollers      into these sockets. The "show" wheels, meanwhile, get      center-bored . . . and lag screwed to 2" lengths of 3/4"      dowel. Each of these four assemblies can then be glued into      the holes you've already provided for them in the axle      housing plugs.<br />      <br />      Half-liter plastic soft drink bottles provide our      convertible with suitable head- and taillights. The main      beams are made by cutting the necks off two containers,      then slicing the midsections from each. The two remaining      parts of each bottle can now be forced together-base into      the top-and the resulting pods painted, drilled, and bolted      to the tops of the front fenders. At the rear, the bottoms      from two similar bottles can be given a coat of red paint      before being glued to the back panel.<br />      <br />      All that's left now is to give your jalopy a snappy enamel      paint job. Although you could have done this before you      assembled the pieces, it's a lot neater to do it afterward,      and to simply mask the already painted parts before you go      on to a different color. If you don't care to use Dennis'      scheme as a model, vary it to suit your taste.<br />      <br />      Mr. Burkholder advises that it'll take up to six hours to      bring the project to completion, considering that the      pieces must be cut and fit, and the glue given time to dry      between steps. But, for an overall investment of a buck or      two (and a couple of evenings), we really don't think you      could go wrong!    </p>
