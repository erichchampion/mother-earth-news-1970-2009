                        <p>      Marc Bristol-a homegrown musician who performs regularly      throughout the Pacific Northwest-began sharing his      knowledge of do-it-yourself entertainment with MOTHER      readers back in issue 50. Marc's columns have touched on      everything from access information for recorded music to      detailed instructions on how to make your own instruments.      Marc is interested in hearing any suggestions, comments, or      questions you may have about the subject of do-it-yourself      music, and he'll try to rite about requested topics in      future columns. Address your correspondence-for this column      and this column only-to Marc Bristol, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box      25, Duvall, Washington 98019.</p>      <h5 id="byline">by Marc Bristol</h5>			<p>      Irish music has played an important role in the American      folk scene over the past few years, so it's only natural      that the folk harp (a freestanding "bow" instrument,      usually about three feet tall) would come into its own on      this side of the Atlantic. Today, most folk harp activity      is taking place along the West Coast, the home of several      people who manufacture-and make music on-the Irish      instruments. I'd like to tell you about some of the      organizations and individuals behind this movement.<br />      <br />      A good place to start is Lark in the Morning (Dept. TMEN,      P.O. Box 1176, Mendocino, California 95460). This firm's      interesting catalog opens with a section devoted solely to      harps. Of course, the publication lists many other      music-makers as well-including such hard-to find      instruments as concertinas, button accordions, bagpipes,      hurdy-gurdies, and hammered dulcimers-in addition to      instruction books, records, accessories, and such.<br />      <br />      The good folks at Lark also sponsor a summer music camp      that might interest those of you who are-or could be-in      California. It offers personal workshop instruction on the      Irish harp . . . and just about any other instrument      typical of Irish music. Lark also conducts seminars on      specific instruments at various times of the year, and you      can ask for more information on these when you write for      the catalog.<br />      <br />      Next, although some of their products are sold through      Lark, I'd like to mention a husband-and-wife musical team      hailing from my neck of the woods: Philip and Pam Boulding,      who run an outfit called Magical Strings (Dept. TMEN, P.O.      Box 4086, Seattle, Washington 98104). The Bouldings      manufacture both Irish harps and hammered dulcimers      (they'll send you a free brochure and price list upon      request), and make mighty fine music on them, too. Check      out their "Spring Tide" album (from Flying Fish Records,      Dept. TMEN, 1304 West Schubert, Chicago, Illinois      60614).<br />      <br />      Before we go any further with the subject of Irish music,      though, I'd like to stop and pay tribute to the Irish      musician: Turlough O'Carolan, a blind minstrel who lived      from 1670 to 1738 and composed hundreds of songs for the      harp during his lifetime. Most of his lyrics have been      lost, but his melodies live on. So influential was      O'Carolan's work, in fact, that Ireland has bestowed on him      the title of National Composer.<br />      <br />      The earliest harps were strung with metal wire, and those      who played them-called "harpers"--were at one time highly      honored members of Irish and Scottish society. But as a      result of successive waves of foreign culture invasions,      the harpers gradually lost their social status and were      reduced to serving as court entertainers or becoming      wandering street musicians. As such, Turlough O'Carolan      roamed the country, composing songs often named for his      various benefactors. (This custom of "plugging the hand      that feeds thee" was widely practiced by the writers and      artists of yesteryear . . . including William      Shakespeare.)<br />      <br />      Of course, there are also many talented contemporary      writers and performers of Irish tunes. And one of the best      of the bunch is Sylvia Woods, the first American ever to      win the all-Ireland harp championships (in 1980). The      series of compositions in her album, "The Harp of      Brandiswhiere", are based on the legend of the harper      Brandiswhiere and his apprentice (and lover) Telena, who      live on a magic island. When an evil sorcerer conspires to      destroy the island's beauty and manages to capture Telena      in a "gypsy mirage", a battle ensues . . . but in the end,      the music of the harper prevails over the spell maker's      evil power. The compositions on this album feature      arrangements that call upon instruments as varied as the      harp, flute, cimbalom, bass, trumpet, celesta . . . and      even wind chimes. Overall, the music is serene, and the      story is certainly captivating. "The Harp of Brandiswhiere"      can be ordered from Tonmeister Records, Dept. TMEN, 6147'/2      Eleanor Avenue, Hollywood, California 90038 (or directly      from the artist, at the Sylvia Woods Harp Center, Dept.      TMEN, P.O. Box 29521, Los Angeles, California 90029).<br />      <br />      Then again, those of you who can't make it to California      next summer for that Lark in the Morning harp workshop      might be glad to know that Ms. Woods has written a book      that's packed full of information on learning how to play      the harp. It's called, appropriately enough, <em>Teach      Yourself How to Play the Folk Harp,</em> and opens with a      bit of history, followed by basic instruction on how to      hold the instrument. Next, the reader is guided through a      series of practice exercises and increasingly complex      tunes. The book also contains useful information about harp      tuning, replacing strings, and care of the instrument. The      songs Ms. Woods has selected to accompany the instructions      are mostly familiar ones that come to us from a variety of      sources . . . including popular, classic, and Irish folk.      (There are even a couple of O'Carolan com positions in this      fine self-instruction manual.)<br />      <br />      Yet another worthwhile collection of harp tunes is found on      Melissa Morgan's album, "Erin's Harp". Melissa plays Irish,      Celtic, and pedal harp, and is accompanied by Jonathan      Parker (on dulcimer) and Neal Hellman (on guitar). Many of      the compositions here are O'Carolan's, although the disk      includes traditional folk tunes by other writers, too. Ms.      Morgan's album is available from Kicking Mule Records      (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 158, Alder point, California      95411).<br />      <br />      Melissa also offers cassette tapes of her original      music-much of which shimmers with ethereal beauty-and      self-instruction materials for the harp. To learn more      about them, write Melissa Morgan at Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box      4024, San Diego, California 92104.<br />      <br />      The final album I'll mention here-which isn't strictly      confined to the harp, and draws upon the voices of other      instruments, as well as vocals-is Robin Williamson's "Songs      of Love and Parting". Each of the tunes in this enjoyable      collection is a Williamson original, and all are      traditional folk renditions. For me, the finest of the      batch is a piece entitled "For Mr. Thomas", inspired by the      works of Dylan Thomas, the famous Welsh poet. Williamson      first heard Thomas's <em>Under Milk</em> Wood at the age of      nine, and later remarked that the words held his attention      as if he'd been locked in the grip of a vise. Well, the      song-poems Mr. Williamson cut for this album had the same      effect on <em>me.</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>ROBIN WILLIAMSON</strong><br />      <br />      Robin may be familiar to some of you as a result of his      earlier work with The Incredible String Band (which he      helped found)... and/or through the Merry Band (in which      Sylvia Woods was also a player). Williamson's album is      available from Flying Fish Records . . . a good source for      Irish traditional music, as well as for folk music of      practically any persuasion.
