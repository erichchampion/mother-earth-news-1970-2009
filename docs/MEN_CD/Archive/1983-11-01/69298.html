                        <p><em>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us for      instance - have read Paul's book</em> The Population Bomb),      <em>few people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (the type that tends to be      published only in technical journals and college texts).      That's why we're pleased to present this regular semi      technical column by these well-known authors/      ecologists/educators.</em></p>      <h5 id="byline">by Anne and Paul Ehrlich</h5>			<p>      Recent studies indicate that our previous evaluation of the      ecological impact of nuclear war (in MOTHER NO. 71) was      probably <em>much</em> too optimistic! Put simply, the      potential effects of the production of huge amounts of      smoke and dust (resulting from a nuclear attack), upon      which we speculated in our earlier column, have now been      subjected to the scrutiny of atmospheric scientists. And      the results of that research are frightening.<br />      <br />      The most thorough of these studies owes its inspiration, in      part, to a catastrophe that occurred long before <em>Homo      sapiens</em> arrived on the scene. About 65 million years      ago, at the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary      geological periods (it's called the KT boundary), a number      of groups of unspectacular microscopic marine creatures      went extinct quite suddenly. Furthermore, the last of the      dinosaurs accompanied them into oblivion.<br />      <br />      The cause of the K-T extinctions-as well as the actual      speed with which they took place remains rather      controversial. One recent hypothesis suggests that they      were the consequence of a thick cloud of dust that was      thrown into the atmosphere by the impact of a gigantic      meteor. A good bit of interesting geological evidence      supports this theory, too, and it-in turn-has stimulated      scientific consideration of the potential climatic (and      other) effects of suddenly introducing massive amounts of      particulate matter into the atmosphere.<br />      <br />      <strong>A COMPLICATED SYSTEM</strong><br />      <br />      Of course, evaluating the effects of such a hypothetical      event is far from simple, partly because the workings of      the atmosphere are not yet completely understood. In      particular, predicting the results of relatively minor      atmospheric changes is often impossible. However, the      effects of <em>major</em> changes can sometimes be more      readily calculated (for example, the primary differences      between winter and summer are easily forecast).<br />      <br />      Today, projections produced by computers are made with      models that are very simplified, compared with actual      weather systems, and carry uncertainties about the effects      of even large-scale disturbances. Nonetheless, such      projections <em>can</em> provide valuable insights into the      climatic results of atmospheric changes.<br />      <br />      Once the investigation of massive particulate injections      into the atmosphere was stimulated by interest in the K-T      extinctions, it was a logical step to apply computer      analysis to the meteorological consequences of an atomic      war. This is precisely what a small group of physical      scientists did. A draft paper based on their work was      subjected to the scrutiny of a conference of leaders in      that field this past April, and the results were then      immediately presented to a group of distinguished      biologists. Both meetings were closed to the public in      order to prevent the premature release of tentative      conclusions.<br />      <br />      The authors of the paper on atmospheric effects-R.P. Turco,      O.B. Toon, T. Ackerman, J.B. Pollack, and the well-known      astronomer Carl Sagan-gave the document the lugubrious      (and, unfortunately, appropriate) acronym TTAPS. The TTAPS      conclusions can be summarized briefly: If a nuclear      exchange exploded as little as 100 megatons (about 1% of      the combined megatonnage contained in U.S. and Soviet      strategic arsenals), <em>it could produce sufficient dust      and smoke to prevent 99% or more of the sunlight from      reaching the Earth's surface for weeks!</em><br />      <br />      We do want to emphasize the word "could", because of the      many variables involved. While as little as 100 megatons      -if distributed over cities in a manner that would maximize      soot producing fires <em>might</em> produce such a      catastrophe, a larger war that expended 5,000 to 10,000      megatons would be far more likely to bring about a      worldwide "blackout". Yet even in a larger war, the size      and altitude of the explosions could produce a variety of      effects. High-yield ground bursts-used to dig out the      enemy's missile silos-would inject vast amounts of dust      into the <em>upper</em> atmosphere (the stratosphere), and      smaller air bursts used against cities and troops-would      ignite huge, widespread fires, injecting soot into the      <em>lower</em> layer of air (the troposphere).<br />      <br />      The characteristics of these two layers are very different.      The troposphere is relatively well mixed vertically, and      particles in it usually settle out rather rapidly. The      stratosphere, in contrast, is quite stable, and particles      tend to remain in it for a long time. But the presence of      huge quantities of dust and soot could change those      characteristics, possibly even destroying the division      between troposphere and stratosphere!<br />      <br />      The degree to which atmospheric effects would spread from      the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere would be determined      by the geographic placement of the nuclear bursts and by      what happened to the structure of the atmosphere. A final      uncertainty is that the simple TTAPS model doesn't include      the effects of atmospheric motions. Nevertheless, despite      its built-in uncertainties, the study's basic findings have      recently been supported by a more complex, dynamic model      run by Dr. Stephen H. Schneider's group at the National      Center for Atmospheric Research.<br />      <br />      <strong>A GAME WITH NO WINNERS</strong><br />      <br />      Basically, then, TTAPS and related studies can't tell us      precisely what will happen in an atomic war . . . but they      can tell us what consequences can't <em>be ruled</em> out.      Such "worst case scenarios" are vitally important to      decision makers (and to the rest of us!) . . . and the      TTAPS description of the possible effects of a war fought      largely in the Northern Hemisphere is enough to make any      sane strategist forget all about "winning" a nuclear      battle.<br />      <br />      The blocking of incoming solar radiation would produce      severe climatic disturbances, the most important of which      would be a pronounced surface cooling of the globe . . .      especially in the continental regions of the Northern      Hemisphere. In a matter of weeks, the average temperature      could drop to far below freezing and remain very low for      months. (The Schneider group's model also shows that in      three weeks much of this land area would be plunged into      below-freezing weather ... even in the month of July!) And      the TTAPS study predicts that, for as long as a year after      the war, temperatures might remain subnormal. At worst, the      planet's entire surface would be dusky or dark at noon . .      . and most land areas would be in the grip of temperatures      well below the freezing point.<br />      <br />      The biologists who were consulted were unanimous in their      opinion that any war that caused widespread cooling and      darkness would have no less than a catastrophic impact on      natural and agricultural ecosystems. (Again, however, the      precise nature of the consequences would depend on such      unknowns as the season in which the war broke out and the      degree to which atmospheric changes spread southward.) The      combination of freezing cold with light levels too low to      permit photosynthesis would destroy most of Earth's growing      vegetation . . . upon which all animals, including people,      are completely dependent. Much of the flora, especially in      temperate zones, would eventually regenerate from seeds and      roots, but by then most of the animals would be beyond      saving. Standing crops in the Northern Hemisphere that      survived fires would be destroyed by the freezing      temperatures and lack of sunlight.<br />      <br />      As all the streams, rivers, and lakes froze, water would      become scarce. Low light levels would reduce the      productivity of the ocean, too. And all of these disasters      would occur in combination with the presence of toxic smog      over the entire Northern Hemisphere . . . higher levels of      radiation than previously forecast . .. and a variety of      other assaults on both people and ecosystems (many of which      we discussed in our earlier column).<br />      <br />      <strong>DOWN THE PATH</strong> <strong>OF THE      DINOSAURS</strong><br />      <br />      If you put all this information together, just what have      you got? Well, you have a rather clear idea that-after a      nuclear warcivilization would have almost no chance of      surviving in the Northern Hemisphere. The vast majority of      its inhabitants would be dead . . . and those not killed      outright by blast, fire, and lethal radiation would quickly      succumb to exposure, thirst, starvation, disease, or      radiation sickness in the freezing, smoggy darkness.<br />      <br />      You can also see the likelihood of an epidemic of sudden      <em>extinctions</em> of nonhuman organisms even more      dramatic than the one that occurred at the K-T boundary.      Finally, you may now have the chilling suspicion that      humankind itself might be pushed rapidly down the path to      oblivion once trod by the dinosaurs.<br />      <br />      <em>The basic results of the TTAPS study and the      conclusions of the biologists are summarized in two      manuscripts recently submitted to</em> Science      <em>magazine.
