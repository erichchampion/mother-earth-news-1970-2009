                    <h5 id="byline">      by Phil Schappert    </h5>    <p>      Related Articles<br />      â€¢ Butterfly Families    </p>    <p>      <em>Follow these simple steps to attract more "flying      flowers" into your yard.</em>    </p>        <p>      Butterflies are one of Mother Nature's best head-turners      - as they flutter by, their colorful and delicate      beauty seldom fails to stop us in our tracks. But despite      our attraction to them, our activities frequently damage      their habitat. Some insects have large ranges and travel      long distances, but many butterflies spend their entire      short lives in areas not much larger than most back yards.      So whether we're manicuring our lawns with chemicals or      turning a wild meadow into a new strip mall, butterflies      are particularly sensitive to our actions.    </p>    <p>      Conversely, though, butterfly conservation can be quite      simple: If you create a butterfly garden, you can provide      an oasis of habitat that can sustain the entire life      history of some butterflies - even simple changes to      your back yard can yield large benefits. You'll have the      satisfaction of making an appreciable difference for these      beautiful creatures, which your family will be able to      enjoy up close and personal. And if you garden, you already      have a head start.    </p>    <p>      Follow the steps outlined below and think of your butterfly      garden as a miniature wildlife preserve - and a part      of a local network of similar backyard sanctuaries -      and you'll be well on your way to helping butterfly and      other insect populations persist and thrive, even in urban      environments.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fulfilling Butterflies" Needs</strong>    </p>        <p>      The shorter a butterfly's flight, the more likely it will      get what it needs without falling prey to predators. Look      at your neighborhood from a butterfly's perspective:      Consider how far butterflies fly to find all the resources      they need to live. How far will they have to travel if they      can't find what they need in your backyard garden? If your      neighbors also garden for wildlife, then your community can      create a network of habitat corridors along which      butterflies can move.    </p>    <p>      To turn your garden into a butterfly sanctuary you'll want      to provide the necessary resources for each life stage:      egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and adult. Here      are 10 steps you can take to help you create a      butterfly-friendly environment:    </p>    <p>      1. Choose caterpillar food plants and nectar plants. In      addition to nectar-rich flowers, be sure to include      caterpillar host plants, such as dill (Anethum graveolens),      milkweeds (Asclepias), pussy willow (Salix discolor) and      sulfur buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum). These will give      female butterflies places to lay their eggs and provide      food for their caterpillars. Host plants also help attract      males looking for females. For a list of the best butterfly      garden plants for your area, consult The Butterfly      Gardener's Guide, published by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden      [to order call (718) 623-7286 or visit www.bbg.org ].    </p>    <p>      It is unfortunate that many gardeners consider caterpillars      pests when they may be the most interesting stage of the      butterfly's life cycle. Many gardeners fail to realize that      where there are host plants and caterpillars, there      eventually will be butterflies.    </p>    <p>      2. Give preference to native plants and wildflowers. The      local butterflies that you are trying to attract have a      history with the local plants. Given a choice between      unknown, foreign plant species and native species, the      butterflies will most likely prefer natives. Also, native      plants give a sense of place to your yard and to the      community, making Tucson, Ariz., reflect the nearby desert      while draping Tampa, Fla., in tropical foliage.    </p>    <p>      3. Arrange plants thoughtfully. Most butterfly habitats      include several layers, with a variety of plants at      differing heights. To emulate nature's multilayered      approach, you should include plants that bloom at different      heights, as well as small flowering shrubs that offer twigs      for perching. Consider adding a few vines to your plant      choices since these often bloom at various heights. Masses      of blooms, or the close proximity of caterpillar host      plants, are more attractive to butterflies than widely      spaced plants, so consider extensive plantings of      particularly luring species like Mexican sunflowers      (Tithonia) or asters.    </p>    <p>      4. Pick plants for every season. Attract adult butterflies      with colorful flowers that offer nectar from spring through      fall, or choose a variety of plants that bloom at different      times of the season to achieve the same effect. It also is      good to provide a range of suitable host plants for      multi-brooded species. For example, provide monarchs with      early-blooming milkweeds that may die back halfway through      summer, as well as late-blooming species that provide      suitable egg-laying sites later in the season.    </p>    <p>      5. Create a sunny corner. Butterflies need some open, sunny      spaces out of the wind where they can bask. Their bodies      depend on the temperature of the air around them, and they      need sunshine to warm up to flight temperature. Do not      cover every square inch of your garden with plants -      instead leave a low, protected corner, or even a centrally      located spot, as a butterfly sunning area.    </p>        <p>      6. Provide shelter and perches. Butterflies also need      sheltered areas to escape strong winds and rain.      Unfortunately, so-called "butterfly houses" rarely achieve      their goal (although they do make good refuges for spiders      and wasps, predators that help control garden pests).      Instead, a border of shrubs and trees can provide host      plants for larvae as well as dry places where butterflies      can hide from their own predators or bad weather.    </p>    <p>      Unmowed edges of grasses, clovers and dandelions also      provide shelter and early nectar for certain species. Some      butterflies also require perches where they can watch for      mates, so tall herbs or small flowering shrubs can serve a      dual purpose.    </p>    <p>      7. Set up a puddling spot. In addition to the nectar they      sip from plants, most species need to acquire compounds      they cannot get from plants. Many of these are mineral      salts that are naturally available in garden soil. An empty      sandy space under a birdbath where the soil often is wet is      the perfect spot for butterflies to gather on the ground      and "puddle" to get these additional nutrients (see photo      above).    </p>    <p>      8. Relax your neat and tidy standards. A garden that looks      and acts more like nature is not only easier on the person      maintaining it, but also allows habitat to develop for all      four butterfly life stages. Leave a corner of your yard      untended, allowing native grasses to grow and feed larvae      of skippers and satyrs. Don't remove clovers; they provide      early nectar to a variety of insects and are larval host      plants for sulphurs, blues and skippers. In autumn, let      fallen leaves create a natural mulch - where moths      and skippers pupate - before the leaf litter      decomposes into nutrients for your garden.    </p>    <p>      9. Lose the lawn. Plan to reduce or eliminate your lawn,      which offers nothing to wildlife and uses precious water.    </p>    <p>      10. Hold the poisons. One caveat that should be readily      appreciated by anyone with a butterfly garden is that the      use of pesticides - even natural control agents such      as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), which kills all      caterpillars - should be strictly controlled or, even      better, avoided altogether. Stick with natural products      such as insecticidal soaps or plant-derived oils for those      rare occasions when pest control is needed. I rarely use      even natural pesticides in my garden, preferring to let      nature take its own course - which includes letting      lizards, spiders, wasps, ants and other insect predators do      the dirty work for me.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Look Beyond Your Butterfly Sanctuary</strong>    </p>    <p>      If butterflies are worth attracting to your garden, aren't      they also worth having in local parks, public gardens and      natural areas? And to ensure that there are butterflies      available to come to your garden, don't you also need to      help protect them everywhere? My best advice is to be      proactive rather than reactive. Don't wait for butterflies      to become endangered, but work now to help keep them safe.      For example, ask local or state agencies to cease, or at      least limit, roadside pesticide spraying. Ask them to      ensure that roadside mowing is rotated through the seasons      instead of always being done at the same time in the same      place each year, and to use native plants wherever      possible. Any of these initiatives will help ensure the      survival of these marvelous creatures.    </p>    <p>      Adapted from The Butterfly Gardener's Guide, edited by      Claire Hagen Dole and one of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's      All-Region Guides.
