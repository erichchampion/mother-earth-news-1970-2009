                    <p>      <strong>Technology languishes, but aesthetics are      hot.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Matt Scanlon    </h5>            <p>      "It was tough for some manufacturers to keep them in      stock," says Mike Van Buren, technical director of the      Hearth Products Association. "Though the efforts involved      in chopping, carrying and storing wood have lately made      wood heat a tough chore for some owners, millennium fears      definitely changed the landscape."    </p>        <p>      When our lights stayed on in the first days, then weeks, of      January, the lights went out on the woodstove craze. This      year, as with most years, gas and electric stoves regained      their 70% market footprint, with gas and pellet returning      to 25%. More interesting than simple figures is the fact      that three-quarters of gas and electric stoves are used for      "aesthetic" purposes only. In other words, they provide a      home with beautiful flames, but any heat generated is      basically an afterthought. As we walked through the      hundreds of stove models at this year's Hearth. Products      Expo in Baltimore, the concept of "flame as art" - evident      in models such as Heat & Glo's CFX Diamond (above) -      struck us as an increasingly important selling point for      stovemakers. One particularly striking addition to some gas      stoves this year has been the inclusion of a "heat dump" -      a system in which heat from a gas stove is actually vented      outside. "This system's designed for homeowners in warmer      climates," says Van Buren, "who want the beauty of a fire      but can't comfortably retain the heat." In truth, most      owners of gas stoves are grateful for the heat, but the      aesthetic burners are gaining ground every year.    </p>    <p>      It's hard not to feel despondent watching gas being      consumed for the sake of visual pleasure, and we had to      keep out tongues in check as we watched heat dumps busily      wasting fuel.    </p>        <p>      Blaming the manufacturer for a questionable market trend,      however, is like blaming Italy for a preponderance of      pizza: They build what we want.    </p>    <p>      On the traditional wood heat side of the $2.5 billion      hearth products industry which has doubled in the last ten      years), manufacturers breathed a sigh of relief when the      EPA chose not to modify its emissions standards in 2000. As      a result, design seemed to make a more determined stride      toward the more traditional. If wood heat is your      preference, Morso's Squirrel typifies this return to      old-time stoves. Waterford's entire line, from the smaller      Trinity up to the full-blown Stanley Cookstove are also      wood heat standouts. Thelin's Gnome and Martin's Vent-Free      Cast Iron, though gas burners, look too, as if they came      from Grandad's living room.    </p>        <p>      The last trends in true woodburners worth mentioning are      the masonry stove, exterior furnace and the fresh-air      vented model. The short, hot burns and lasting heat      produced through a heavy masonry stove, such as Tulkivi's      TU1000 and similar models by Temp-Cast, take some of the      chore out constant fire maintenance and wood hauling. Soon      after you light a fire in a masonry stove, the temperature      in the firebox rises to 1,200Â°F or more. The extreme      heat results in secondary combustion, which consumes most      of the gases produced by the burning wood. Thus, a      considerable amount of heat that would otherwise go up the      flue heats the masonry instead. Woodstock Soapstone also      uses soapstone as a heat sink, but on a smaller scale than      full masonry models.    </p>        <p>      Central Boiler's outdoor furnaces, such as the Classic CL      4436SB can make off-the-grid living a more practical      consideration by combining your air, hot water and even      radiant floor heating systems into one woodburning      appliance.    </p>        <p>      An efficient home in the winter is, of course, effectively      shut, caulked and sealed. This exclusion of outdoor air can      make for easier heating, but it can also radically      compromise indoor air quality. Travis Industries'      Xtrordinair woodburning fireplace draws outside air into      the firebox via an exterior electric fan, thus assuring a      continuous flow of clean air.    </p>
