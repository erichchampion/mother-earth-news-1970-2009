                    <p>      <strong>Keep your garden and yard<br />      safe from curious intruders.</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Suburban" While tailed Deer    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by John Vivian    </h5>            <p>      Kindhearted suburbanites set out high-frequency soundmakers      or sprinkle on proprietary deer-repellent concoctions from      the pet store. Some collect human waste or gather lion and      tiger droppings from zoos and scatter these around the      gardens. In our experience, only three methods work: rotten      eggs, a big dog with a loud bark and all his own teeth, and      a pair of electromechanical devices that are effective      against many garden interlopers.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the easiest defense is to mix eggs in water and      spray on your plants. The eggs will rot imperceptibly,      producing an offensive sulphur-dioxide odor. Deer will be      repelled by a spray too light for humans to sense. A ribbon      of heavy spray surrounding the garden is said to work, but      we find that you must spray (lightly) everything in the      orchard or garden for full effect. We mix two or three eggs      to a gallon of warm water, let it steep for a day, then      apply it with a backpack insecticide sprayer set on      medium-fine spray. Applications should be renewed weekly in      the spring; later, apply only to succulent new growth and      fruit every couple of weeks.    </p>    <p>      A male dog of any thick coated, naturally territorial breed      that is trained to patrol your growing areas night and day      in all weather will discourage most pests. We like German      shepherds, but any large, athletic breed will do, except      for golden retrievers, which have been bred to adore all      God's creatures.    </p>    <p>      For a few hundred dollars you can buy a training collar and      bury a radio signal generator and broadcast antenna wires      to create an "invisible fence" that will establish a      perimeter and contain the dog (see " Homestead Hound, Part      II "). This is best for densely pop ulated areas.<br />    </p>    <p>      Living in the distant and sparsely populated boondocks, I      find that taking a young dog on frequent leashed walks      around the gardens establishes his territory. When he      matures, he will patrol it by instinct. Scattering the      dog's collected droppings along the route strengthens in      his mind the identification of his turf and will further      encourage him to move his latrine area out of the yard and      along the perimeter of his territory. Keep your dog tied or      confined during hunting season, as he may get shot while      trying to woof off a party of hunters. Ditto any      free-ranging livestock.    </p>    <p>      Effective against deer, raccoons and black bears (who eat      more vegetation than animal matter and adore sweet peas) is      a battery-powered transistor radio set in the garden dusk      to dawn and tuned to a raucous, all-night rock station. If      close to house power, you can plug the radio into an      auto-timer and augment the sound with blinking lights;      strings of white outdoor Christmas minilights work well.      You can also waterproof an electronic project box with      electrician's tape and clear mastic and fit it with a      blinking red or green LED (light-emitting diode) with an      on/off switch and a dry-cell power supply. These are cheap,      portable and easy to use. Change the location of radio and      lights every few days.    </p>    <p>      If your garden is within reach of a hose, you can try a      motion-sensitive Scarecrowâ„¢. Encased in housing that      resembles the head of a big-eyed, big-beaked tropical macaw      (or enclosed in a less conspicuous, less-scary-to-songbirds      plastic rock), this critter repeller made by the Canadian      company Contech is a motion-activated water sprinkler that      can be staked in your garden or attached to a fence. Fed      from your garden hose and powered by a 9-volt transistor      radio battery, the Scarecrow comes alive with a chattering      oscillator-type water sprinkler whenever anything crosses      its 35-foot, arc-shaped field of view. One or two in the      corner(s) of your garden plot will send any animal-wild or      domestic (except perhaps a duck)-scurrying away unharmed. I      find the Scarecrow to be the only device effective against      groundhogs and woodchucks, other than a well-aimed load of      buckshot or a .22 high-powered .bullet. An owner survey      indicates that it's also effective at least 88% of the time      against cats and rabbits.    </p>    <p>      The Scarecrow costs about $70 from reliable mail-order      sources such as Real Goods or direct from the Web at      www.scatmat.com/scarecro2.htm . There, you will also find      an online direct-ordering form and a directory of retail      dealers.    </p>        <h3>      Major Carnivores    </h3>    <p>      Black bears and mountain lions (cougars) pose an increasing      threat as natural habitats are reduced by development. Many      new-to-the-country folks lack adequate means of      self-protection because they weren't raised with the      countryman's pioneer-heritage hunting and trapping      tradition, nor with his lifelong training in firearms.      Also, inappropriate (but well-meaning) no-hunting      legislation limits a person's willingness and ability to      use guns or traps, even if they know how.    </p>    <p>      Over the past decade, several people have been stalked and      killed by cougars in California. And bear attacks, once      rare, are now occurring more frequently nationwide. In      national parks, especially around the Boundry Waters      trails, camps and canoe routes along the U.S./Canadian      border in the upper Midwest, grizzly and black bear attacks      have been reported. Last spring, a female hiker was killed      and partially consumed by a black bear mother and a      yearling cub in Smoky Mountain National Park in the      Carolinas. And in early summer, Mary Beth Miller, a top      female biathlete, was killed by a black bear just outside      of Quebec City in Canada.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps because they are leaving their dens before natural      food is available (global warming has brought shorter      winters and earlier springs; see " Endless Summer " ) -      both cougars and bears are invading country-home barns and      backyards at dusk and early evening all around the      continent. Inexperienced yearlings and still-lactating      mothers with hungry young are the main culprits. Bears seem      to be attracted by the contents of birdfeeders and garbage      cans, while cougars are after unrestrained livestock,      including small dogs and cats. Both are lured by the meaty      smell of an outdoor barbecue.    </p>    <p>      So, don't attract them. Once weather begins to warm up and      sap begins to flow, quit feeding wild birds and bring      livestock inside a stout barn at dusk. Never leave garbage      out overnight. Don't unpack the barbecue till you see      squirrels in the trees and day temperatures are warm. Call      small children in well before sunset and keep them in. Get      floodlights for the yard and leave them on till the dog      wants in for the evening. Don't let the cat stay out at      night.    </p>        <h3>      Firearms    </h3>    <p>      There are legion country dwellers who very purposefully      reject the use of firearms of any kind - an opinion      certainly to be respected. Others consider one or two very,      very carefully stored and maintained guns helpful at least      and critically important at most.    </p>    <p>      I keep a ten-gauge double-barrel cap and ball      muzzle-loading shotgun over the back door, loaded with #10      buckshot, fresh percussion caps and a full, fresh charge of      XXX black powder. A piercing battery-powered spot-type      flashlight is taped to the stock and points to where the      barrels are aimed at 50 feet. When the kids were young, it      sported a combination trigger lock. Even if the buckshot      fails to connect, the flash, roar and cloud of white smoke      ought to scare off any threatening critter.    </p>    <p>      Even on a deep-woods hunting trip, I carry one of Cabela's      .44 caliber LeMat cap and ball, nine-shot revolvers      muzzle-loaded with a low charge of 25 grams of black powder      under round ball ammo. I also carry a 20-gauge shot barrel      loaded with No. 5 "blue meanie" miniballs (General George      Washington's favorite ammo) in a tie-down, cross-draw      holster.    </p>    <p>      Neither size shot should be lethal or cause serious injury      to a mature, thick-coated bear or cougar except at      point-blank range, but either would give any animal short      of a Cape buffalo serious pause - and give us time to      hightail it. If the animal persists, there's always the      other barrel of the blunderbuss or a full nine-shot      cylinder in the .44 and a spare loaded cylinder or two on      the holster belt.    </p>    <h3>      Brother Crow    </h3>    <p>      Crows and ravens are so ingeniously clever that many      traditional Amerindian cultures considered them kindred      spirits. They remain so for some of us today. In the      spring, crows delight in harvesting newly planted seed      succulents, especially your just-sprouted sweet corn.    </p>        <p>      They'll monitor newly plowed and planted fields and swoop      down at first light to pull seed corn when the first tips      of green sprouting leaves appear above ground. By the time      you are up to inspect the field, all you'll find of your      hoped-for corn crop are lines of little pits in the soil      with scatterings of nipped-off leaves and roots, along with      crow tracks and droppings.    </p>    <p>      Traditional scarecrows made from wooden crosses garbed in      loose garments and stuffed in straw are effective visual      deterrents. The most successful ones are made from a      lightweight material hung on fine thread close to the      ground. It will move when the air is disturbed by a large      bird flaring its wings to land. Sensing any unexpected      movement - especially of a shiny and unnatural polished      material - the crow will abort the landing and flap away,      cawing out its raspy warning. Scarecrows can be made from      strips of light-colored, lightweight cloth. More effective      - and waterproof, so they won't sag after a rain - are thin      strips of tin foil on thread attached to thin ends of      sapling whips poked into the ground every five or six feet      throughout the garden. You ran also hang foil from of      threads strung between stakes surrounding the plot.    </p>    <p>      Be sure the foil strips are free to move in the air;      snagged on soil or a plant, they are useless. If crows are      thick in your area, be sure to change the foil strip      locations every day till the seedlings are too large for      the crows to pull out. Eventually, the crows will accept      defeat and move along.    </p>    <p>      You can also purchase "big-eye balloons" that are inflated      and hung from whips around the garden. They are designed to      hang with their fearsome eyes looking down and out of sight      until disturbed, but with the slightest wind, the "eyes"      printed on the balloon whip up, looking for all the world      like a pouncing cat.    </p>    <p>      Lastly, the (arguably costly at $200) Vigilante Helikite      from Allsopp, an adjustable-height combination      balloon/kite, has the advantage of a disturbing and      constantly changing motion. Even if grounded by heavy rain,      the kite will relaunch itself in the next dry gust and      patrol the garden 24 hours a day.    </p>    <h3>      Brother Rat    </h3>    <p>      Another clever critter that's part of Amerindian lore is      the native rat - the several species of small,      brownish-colored, savagely wild wood rats that can (and      will) bite if cornered. Rats can find a way to get into      practically anything that contains food; they're voracious      for grain. They'll take whole or milled grain,      molasses-dosed stock grain, pig or rabbit pellets, or dog      food from your storage and haul it by the cheekful to      storage chambers in their complexes. What's left of your      stored grain will be destroyed by the droppings the rats      leave behind.    </p>    <p>      Rats will also harvest newly planted corn or other grain.      Don't slop seed on the soil surface as you plant; if you      do, rats will find it and then snoot around, detecting and      digging up much of what you've planted. Smaller rodents,      such as voles (seldom-seen, shrew-like, pointy-nosed, grey,      mouse-sized rodents) and field mice can do so as well, but      not as voraciously. When wood rat populations surge, losses      can be severe.    </p>    <p>      Store feed in varmint-proof, stout metal trash cans with      secure lids. To protect stored grain from larger (and      smarter) animals such as bears or raccoons, secure      tight-fitting lids with elastic bungees. Even better - as      they can't be gnawed through - are long metal springs with      hooks on the ends that snag over metal handles on each side      of the bin.    </p>    <p>      If birdseed-conditioned black bears can get into your barn,      mere trash cans will not hold up against the bears'      strength and intelligence. In these cases you can secure      grain storage containers inside bear-proof compartments      such as a whole-log cold storage dug into a hillside, a      barn room walled with flush doors and inch-or-thicker      oak-plank walls fitted tightly on the exposed surface, or      in a heavy steel Dempsy-Dumpster-type trash bin with a      deadbolt on the lid.    </p>    <p>      For larger-scale grain storage, rivet together corrugated      sheet steel or buy 12-foot-high commercial spout-fitted      steel grain hoppers or build a wooden corn crib with its      skirts sheathed in aluminum flashing. (visit      <em>www.motherearthnews.com/doityourself</em> )    </p>    <p>      As we learned during childhood from Christopher Robin, "A      bear loves honey; I wonder why he does ...buzz, buzz..."      Bears will attack your honeybee colonies, especially in      earliest spring. I've tried protecting beehives with      hotwire - regular, smooth fence wire on plastic insulators      charged with a conventional fence charger - but the brief,      weak zaps that turn away livestock and deer don't phase      hungry black bears. Surrounding hives with close spirals of      electrified barbed wire seems to work better, as the barbs      get through bear hide and hair.    </p>        <h3>      Small Carnivores    </h3>    <p>      Rats, weasels, skunks, foxes, raccoons and feral house cats      will raid the chicken coop - especially in spring when they      have young to feed. A Hav-a-Hart-type live trap set on      firm, level ground out side the henhouse and baited with      fresh liver will usually trap the interloper.    </p>    <p>      Once you've captured it, take the trap (covered with a      thick cloth to calm a skunk) a good five miles into the      woods, open the door and wait till the animal has left the      area to recover the trap.    </p>    <p>      To keep critters from digging under the shed or gnawing      their way in, dig a two-foot-wide strip of fine-mesh fence      wire six inches deep into the soil around the pen and      staple another strip along the base of the pen walls. Use      spool wire to weave together their adjoining borders. Fence      over any holes already gnawed in the walls or eaves. A      double line of conventional hot wire along the bottom of      pen walls will further discourage entrance.    </p>    <p>      Wild hares and rabbits, meadow mice and voles will girdle      the tender bark of young fruit trees, bush fruit and grape      vines in winter. Dig out sod and soil around the trunk to      several inches below ground. Encircle trunks with      spiral-cut plastic sheet or small-mesh metal hardware cloth      to a foot and a half above ground level (or to 18 inches      above expected snow depth). Be sure to remove in spring to      let trunk expand. Replace for the second winter if bark is      still thin.    </p>    <p>      Rodents will also eat root vegetables left in the garden      during the winter. Either plant enough extra for them or      pull and store roots in an indoor root cellar.    </p>    <h3>      Household Vermin    </h3>    <p>      Pests around the house can be more than a nuisance; they      can carry human diseases. Although cases are rare, bats can      carry rabies, and mice can host and pass on a potentially      fatal hantavirus. Pests belong outdoors. Discourage their      entrance by nailing flashing over entry holes in the house.      When removing rodent droppings, wear a dust mask or wet the      mess down well to avoid breathing in any infected dust.    </p>    <p>      Bats will spend the daylight hours in cracks in the house      cladding, but prefer to roost in groups high inside attic      ceilings. Fill cracks along eaves with steel wool, puttied      in so it won't rust and stain house paint. Inside, shine a      24-hour spotlight into the bats' roosting areas. A loud      radio in the space will further irritate them, and they      will soon roost elsewhere.    </p>        <p>      Small rodents are best controlled by house cats. The      stub-tailed Maine coon cat grows to be huge and is a prime      mouser. So are most nonpedigree strays. Purebred show cats      may be gorgeous and easy to handle, but they can be all      show and no go in the mousing business.    </p>    <p>      Neuter your cats to keep the unwanted pet supply down, keep      them indoors to protect baby cottontail bunnies and      songbirds, and feed them well to keep them hunting vermin.      Lavish them with praise when they present you with a      revolting little critter's carcass, and let them play with      a pitiful, injured-but-still-alive rodent till they get      bored and go looking for a fresh one. To make litterbox      cleaning chores for good mousers minimally ghastly, cover      insides of the litter box with foil or Kraft paper and dump      the lot at each litter change.    </p>    <p>      If you suspect a skunk or raccoon has taken up winter      residence under the porch, use the      strong-light-and-rock-music remedy that evicts bats and      keeps raccoons from harvesting the corn.    </p>    <p>      Finally, at the end of wood-heating weather in the spring,      wedge a piece of fine-mesh poultry wire or hardware cloth      into the top of your woodstove's flue. It will let creosote      evaporate and won't interfere with the occasional summer      hearth fire, will keep climbing raccoons and feral cats      from raising young in the flue bottom, and will discourage      chimney swifts from raising broods in stick-and-mud nests      glued to the flue liner. The fur-lined mammal nests and      tinder-dry stick nests of the birds can easily ignite and      cause a flue fire.    </p>    <p>      Pest control and HOMESTEADING in cyberspace.      www.motherearthnews.com    </p>
