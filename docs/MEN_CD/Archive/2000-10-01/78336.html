                    <p>      <strong>E</strong> ven if you take every precaution to      prevent your dog from injury or illness, there are times      when you might need to apply a little first aid. Most      serious illnesses should be treated by your veterinarian,      but if you're stuck out in the boonies, or if you're      waiting for your harried animal doctor to arrive, the      following guidelines may help during an emergency. Items      marked with an asterisk should always include veterinary      care as well as on-the-farm first aid.    </p>    <h3>      SUSPECTED POISONING    </h3>    <p>      Get your dog to vomit immediately by giving two to three      teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide. To avoid possible      esophageal damage, caustic substances and abrasive objects      should not be vomited back up.<br />      Call National Animal Poison Control at (800)548-2423.    </p>    <h3>      BLEEDING WOUNDS    </h3>    <p>      Clean out the wound as much as possible with warm water or      disinfectants such as diluted iodine (Betadine(restricted)).<br />      Larger wounds can be hosed off.<br />      Apply a clean pressure bandage and seek veterinary care.    </p>    <h3>      SUSPECTED FRACTURES    </h3>    <p>      Immobilize the limb as much as possible.<br />      Apply a padded, rigid splint to the affected limb (duct      tape holds a splint in place weld.    </p>    <h3>      *SEIZURES    </h3>    <p>      Keep your dog from further injuries by providing padding      around its head.<br />      Avoid getting bitten by keeping your hands out of your      dog's mouth.<br />      If the seizure is longer than one or two minutes, cool your      dog down to prevent overheating and brain damage.    </p>    <h3>      *PARALYSIS AND BACK INJURIES    </h3>    <p>      Immobilize your dog with duct tape and place him on a board      to prevent further injury.<br />      Assess the dog's response to pain by pinching its toes on      each foot.    </p>    <h3>      *HEAD TRAUMA    </h3>    <p>      Check pupil position and response to light.<br />      Keep your dog as quiet and still as possible.<br />      Provide supplemental heat if dog is cold.    </p>    <h3>      VOMITING AND DIARRHEA    </h3>    <p>      If neither illness is severe, oral fluids such as      Pedialyte(restricted) or Gatorade(restricted) may be helpful.<br />      Do not feed your dog for 12 hours after vomiting, then give      him or her ice cubes.<br />      Peptobismol(restricted) or Kaopectate(restricted) (dosed by weight) may      help.<br />      Severe or prolonged cases require intravenous fluids.    </p>    <h3>      CONSTIPATION    </h3>    <p>      Introduce dietary fiber such as Metamucil.<br />      Glycerin capsules and enemas may help.<br />      If this is a recurring problem, switch to a higher fiber      dog food.    </p>    <h3>      *COLLAPSE    </h3>    <p>      Your dog should be rushed to the nearest veterinarian,      regardless of the distance.<br />      Be prepared to perform CPR (see "Performing CPR").<br />      Oxygen and IV fluids may be required.    </p>    <h3>      BEE STING/INSECT BITES    </h3>    <p>      Bees and spiders seem to have an affinity for dogs'      mouths.<br />      Give antihistamines, such as Benadryl(restricted), at double the      human dose, every six to eight hours.    </p>    <h3>      PORCUPINE QUILLS    </h3>    <p>      Cut off ends of quills before pulling out.<br />      Sedation may be required (call your vet).    </p>    <h3>      *RATTLESNAKE BITE    </h3>    <p>      Antivenom is rarely needed.<br />      Bites on the head are most common.<br />      Serious bites should be treated with steroids, IV fluids      and antibiotics.    </p>    <h3>      *BLOATED STOMACH (GDV, OR GASTRIC DILATATION AND VOLVULUS)    </h3>    <p>      This condition usually occurs in deep-chested dogs and is      life-threatening.<br />      If your dog's stomach is bloated and he is having trouble      breathing, rush your dog to a veterinary hospital.<br />      If your dog has difficulty breathing, tap on its abdomen.      If you hear a pinging, tympanic sound, you should relieve      the pressure. Firmly insert an 18-gauge, 1 1/2" needle into      the stomach through the body wall. You should hear and      smell gas leaving the stomach. If not, remove the needle      immediately.    </p>    <h3>      EAR INFECTIONS    </h3>    <p>      Clean the ears with a dilute mixture of one part water, 2-3      parts vinegar.<br />      Use a bulb syringe or turkey baster to squirt the mixture      in and suck it out of the ears.<br />      Massage cartilage at base of ears.    </p>    <h3>      COUGHING    </h3>    <p>      May indicate underlying heart disease, respiratory      infection or other serious illness.<br />      Mild cases can be treated with over-the-counter medications      containing dextromorphan, such as Robitussin DM(restricted) dosed      carefully by weight according to label instructions.    </p>    <h3>      SKIN INFECTIONS/HOT SPOTS    </h3>    <p>      Clip the haircoat as short as possible.<br />      Scrub with alcohol or medicated acne pads twice a      day.<br />      Apply antibiotic ointment (such as Bacitracin(restricted)) and/or      cortisone creme (such as Cortaid(restricted)) twice a day.<br />      A veterinary visit, antibiotics and other - prescription      medications or shampoo may be required, particularly if      repeated scratching is causing appreciable wounds on the      skin.    </p>
