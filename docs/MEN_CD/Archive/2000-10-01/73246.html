                    <p>      If you have a splinter you can't get out, break open an egg      and retrieve the membrane that's around the inside of the      shell. Put a little bit of this membrane over the splinter,      and in six or seven hours the splinter will have come out      enough that you can pull it out the rest of the way.    </p>    <p>      <em>Buck Kubs<br /></em> <em>Gowanda, NY</em><br />    </p>    <p>      The biggest worry I have for my garden is that slugs are      going to eat my vegetables before I do. Since I do not like      to use chemicals in my garden, I crunch up empty eggshells      and sprinkle them around the edges of the garden. They are      much too pointy and pokey for the slugs to get over!    </p>    <p>      <em>Kathryn Carrier<br />      Portland, OR</em>    </p>
