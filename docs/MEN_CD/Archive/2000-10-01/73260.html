                            <p>      "We think that the chickens are a pretty good barometer,"      says Tom Skinner, spokesman for the Center for Disease      Control in Atlanta. "It's just a matter of making sure that      we have the resources to do what is necessary to prevent      West Nile from reemerging. Basically, there is no vaccine      to prevent the virus, and there is no drug you can use to      treat it."    </p>    <p>      The West Nile virus first appeared in the Western      hemisphere in 1999 in New York City, claiming seven lives      and afflicting over 60 people. As MOTHER goes to press,      three people have been infected this year, and the virus      has been detected in Rhode Island, Connecticut and      Massachusetts. How the virus migrated to the U.S. is open      to speculation, although some believe that a shipment of      tires from Asia may have transported nesting mosquitoes      into New York Harbor.    </p>    <p>      Beyond the Northeast, many states are casting a watchful      eye through the use of "sentinel" chickens. Scientists at      Florida University are even developing advanced satellite      technology to create a national "risk map" to predict where      another deadly outbreak may occur.    </p>    <p>      While the chances of contracting the disease are minimal,      it doesn't hurt to take precautions. Use insect repellent      containing DEET, get rid of standing water around the      house, and keep screen windows and doors in good condition.      After all, we have to let these insects know that they're      too far west of the Nile .    </p>    <p>      <em>-Devon Madison</em>    </p>
