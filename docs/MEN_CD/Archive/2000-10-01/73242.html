                    <p>      I wanted one of those nifty (and expensive) compost      tumblers, but the price of the product always stopped me in      my tracks. So my husband and I decided to build our own      compost tumbler using things we had around the house. We      found a plastic trash can and drilled holes all over the      can. We also drilled four holes in the rim of the lid and      secured it with four nuts and bolts.    </p>    <p>      I just add my compost ingredients to the can and mix them      by kicking the can over and turning it. Our tumbler was      cheap to make and is easy to use. Best of all, we have      finished, usable compost in several weeks.    </p>    <p>      <em>M.
