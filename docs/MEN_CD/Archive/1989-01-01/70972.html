                <p>      ALASKA'S DEPARTMENT OF NAT ural Resources is issuing      permits allowing businesses to harvest icebergs as a cash      crop. Tim Dimond, of Juneau, Alaska, pulls bergs from the      sea with a crane mounted on a barge, then breaks the ice      into chunks and ships it by freezer van to the AK-Pacific      Company in Seattle, Washington. AK-Pacific, in turn,      packages the ice in sacks and markets it in Japan as      gourmet ice cubes. Glacial ice has become a hot item in the      Land of the Rising Sun, not only because of its novelty but      because of its staying power: Iceberg ice takes twice as      long to melt as "ordinary" ice. A spokesman for the      Southeast Alaska Conservation Council calls the iceberg      harvesting "a new, incompatible, conflicting use of areas      set aside for their natural features, their solitude, their      pristine nature."    </p>    <h3>Big Birds on the Range</h3>    <p>      Texas's and Oklahoma's cattle and oil industries have had      better times, but at least one new enterprise in those      states is booming: ostrich ranching. There are now some      1,000 ostrich ranches in the two states, according to Tom      Mantzel, director of the American Ostrich Association. The      birds are raised primarily for their skin and feathers, but      the real future of the industry, says Mantzel, is in the      birds' meat, which tastes like veal and is low in      cholesterol. The sudden proliferation of American ostrich      ranches is due in large part to the 1986 Anti-Apartheid      Act, which banned the import of South African ostriches.      Arid western rangeland is ideal for the birds, which      require less land than cattle and produce more offspring.    </p>    <h3>Feelin' Fine in '89</h3>    <p>      Tips on home canning, companion planting, selecting      produce, substituting healthful recipe ingredients for the      not-so-healthful, and lots more-they're all in      "Horizons for Health '89," a whimsically illustrated      calendar from the American Institute for Cancer Research.      Single copies are free, though donations to help further      the institute's work are invited. To request a copy, write      to AICR, Dept. CM89, Washington, DC 20069.    </p>
