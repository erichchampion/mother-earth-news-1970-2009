                <p>      MOTHER'S HANDBOOK    </p>        <p>      Masters of the living yeast are the kitchen's true      magicians.</p><h5 id="byline">      By Carol Taylor    </h5>        <p>      A WOMAN WHO BAKES bread can comfort children with a glance,      converse with elms, invent new colors. A man who bakes      bread-why, he can gentle animals with a touch, talk to      teenagers, look good in his undershirt. Or so we are likely      to believe. Such is our reverence for this elemental food      that the people who create it seem to tap an ancient      communal memory, to possess powers that the rest of us can      only dimly imagine.    </p>    <h3>      Staff of Life    </h3>    <p>      Bread pervades our language and literature, a metaphor for      physical and spiritual sustenance.    </p>        <p>      We petition for our daily bread, live not by bread alone,      break bread together. (The word <em>companion</em> derives      from the Latin <em>companio,</em> "one who shares bread.")      The satirist Juvenal lamented that his fellow Romans cared      only for "bread and circuses," a concern we still share: A      modern man who is short of bread could use a little dough      to see him through.    </p>    <p>      And substance preceded the image. Ten thousand years ago,      the domestication of wild grasses made the domestication of      humanity possible. Freed from the necessity to roam      constantly in search of food, humans could settle down and      invent civilization. Heroic images of fur-clad,      spearwielding hunters notwithstanding, we soon fed      ourselves primarily on grains.    </p>    <p>      Before bread, grain was dried on hot rocks or boiled into a      paste or gruel. By the late Stone Age, flat breads were      common. (Remnants endure: Mexican tortillas, Chinese      pancakes, Indian chapaties.) The Egyptians began making      leavened bread about 4000 B.C., probably when a neglected      gruel, contaminated by wild airborne yeasts, fermented and      rose. With characteristic virtuosity, the Greeks became      master bakers who served up 62 varieties.    </p>    <p>      Both Greeks and Romans preferred white bread, the food of      the upper classes; slaves and servants ate the dark. Since      extra labor was required to refine dark flour into light,      it was more expensive and thus a mark of status. Europe      followed the classic tradition. For centuries, coarse, hard      rye bread was the daily fare of peasants-often secondhand,      at that. The masters ate their dinners served up on      rock-hard slabs of bread, called trenchers. When they'd      eaten their meat and gravy, they fed the sopping trenchers      to the servants and the dogs.    </p>    <p>      Dark bread continued to get bad press until the Reverend      Sylvester Graham, 19th-century reformer and grump, began a      campaign to popularize whole grains. They were healthy, he      nagged; they alleviated a wide range of digestive problems.      Besides, milling the bran and germ from the flour was      tantamount to "putting asunder what God has joined      together." (Whole-wheat flour is often called graham flour,      in the good reverend's honor; graham crackers are another      namesake.) With the publication in 1974-a mere      hundred years later-of an article in the <em>Journal      of the American Medical Association,</em> touting the      benefits of dietary fiber, the respectability of wholegrain      bread was assured.    </p>    <p>      During the Industrial Revolution, baking bread became less      of a private enterprise and more of a commercial one. Even      so, packaged bread was not plentiful in grocery stores      until 1930; and until the beginning of World War II, 50% of      the baked goods consumed were produced at home. Now 95% are      store-bought.    </p>    <p>      In the 1970s and 1980s homemade bread has enjoyed a minor      renaissance. Lured by an honest, unadulterated loaf, by the      fragrance and taste of perfectly fresh bread, by the      sensuous pleasure of working the dough, by the pride of      accomplishment, by the sense of participating in an art as      old as humanity itself-more and more of us are doing      it ourselves.    </p>                    <h3>      Basic Bread    </h3>    <p>      The simplest loaf contains just flour, water, yeast and      salt. Almost always, the flour is made from wheat (Fig. 1).      Alone among cereals, wheat contains substantial amounts of      gluten-long, sprawling molecules of protein that,      with the addition of water and handling, mesh into an      elastic network that can stretch and expand, permitting the      loaf to rise. Other grains-rye, oats, corn,      millet-may be added for flavor, texture and      nutrients. But if we are to have leavened bread, we must      have wheat. (Rye has only traces of gluten; used alone, it      will produce a loaf hard enough to break a peasant's tooth.      Other grains have none. Bioengineers hope to be able to      transfer gluten's genetic codes into corn, millet and      sorghum, a development that would revolutionize bread      making.)    </p>    <p>      Yeasts are fungi, one-celled plants-160 species of      them. The <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> are      particularly useful to brewers and bakers. In an anaerobic      environment, like bread dough, they metabolize starches and      sugars, giving off carbon dioxide and alcohol as      by-products. As the bubbles of C0 2 increase and expand,      they stretch the gluten, and the loaf rises.    </p>    <p>      Since the Pharaohs, bakers have transformed flour and yeast      into bread by the same ritual. 1) <em>Making the      dough.</em> All the ingredients (except part of the flour)      are combined and beaten, by hand or (these days) by      machine, to mix the dough and start developing the gluten.      2) <em>Kneading.</em> Pummeling the dough, stretching and      folding it, disperses the yeast, develops the gluten and      evaporates the alcohol. At this stage, the remaining flour      is worked into the dough. 3) <em>Rising.</em> While the      dough sits in a warm place, the yeast multiplies and      produces carbon dioxide, and the dough rises. Then it's      deflated and allowed to rise either once or twice more. 4)      <em>Baking.</em> In a hot oven, the yeast dies and the      elastic gluten solidifies, now able to support all other      ingredientsthe character of which will govern the taste and      texture of the bread.    </p>    <h3>      Ingredients    </h3>    <p>      Flour. Three principal types of wheat dominate the 600      million acres planted to the crop worldwide. <em>Hard</em>      wheat has a hard ker nel and ample protein, including      gluten. It is made into bread flour. <em>Soft</em> wheat,      with little gluten, is milled into pastry and cake flours      (pastries are toughened and ruined by gluten).      <em>Durum</em> wheat is so hard that it isn't even good for      bread, which must have some elasticity; it becomes pasta.    </p>    <p>      <em>Whole-wheat flour</em> contains the entire ground-up      kernel (Fig. 2): the germ, or embryo, rich in oil, vitamins      and minerals; the endosperm, or main body of the kernel,      filled with starch and protein (including the gluten); and      the bran, or hard seed coat. Compared to white flour, which      contains only the endosperm-the germ and bran are      milled out and sold separately-whole-wheat is rich in      flavor, fiber, nutrients and fat. Alas, fat turns rancid      quickly. While white flour is virtually imperishable,      whole-wheat keeps only about a month at room temperature,      or two under refrigeration, before it starts to become      bitter. It pays to check the expiration date on supermarket      packages, or to question the shopkeeper when buying from      bulk bins. The unused portion should be wrapped in an      airtight package and stored in the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Because whole-wheat contains heavy, solid particles of bran      and germ, it may produce a dense loaf. Thus, many recipes      for "whole-wheat" bread call for a portion of white flour,      additional yeast or an extra rising.    </p>    <p>      <em>Whole-wheat pastry flour is</em> milled from whole      kernels of soft wheat. With too little gluten for bread, it      makes crisp, light biscuits and pastries.    </p>    <p>      The market supports a greater variety of white flour, since      most bread, whether commercial or homemade, is light. By      law, white flour must be enriched with niacin, thiamine and      riboflavin (the B vitamins that got milled out with the      germ).    </p>    <p>      <em>Bread flour</em> is made from hard wheat, rich in      protein and gluten; it makes a high, light loaf. Some      brands are treated with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or      potassium bromate, to make the gluten more elastic and more      resistant to overworking by heavy commercial machinery.      Overkneading dough-which leads to the collapse of the      gluten and the failure of the loaf-is rarely a      problem for hand kneaders, who give out long before the      gluten does. Food processors, however, can overwork dough      in a heartbeat.    </p>    <p>      <em>All-purpose flour</em> is a blend of high-gluten hard      wheats and low-gluten soft ones, produced by large mills to      satisfy a wide range of baking needs, from pastries to      breads. Like most compromises, it does everything      adequately and nothing superbly. The <em>unbleached</em>      variety works well.    </p>    <p>      <em>Pastry flour</em> is too gluten-poor for bread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Yeast.</strong> The most common yeast on the      market-and the one used in all recipes here-is      active dry yeast, universally available in small foil      packets of one-fourth ounce each. Alive but dormant, it has      been dehydrated and becomes active when dissolved in warm      liquid. Freshness is vital; yeast that's past its pull date      is a license to fail.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fat.</strong> Butter, margarine, shortening, oil,      lard-in small amounts, all add volume (by lubricating      the gluten, making it more elastic), tenderness, flavor,      moistness and richness. Too little fat will produce a dry,      coarse loaf; too much, an oily, crumbly one.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Salt.</strong> Saltless bread tastes bland and      flat. Although too much damages the yeast and produces a      heavy loaf, a little improves the flavor, strengthens the      gluten and regulates fermentation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sugar.</strong> Sweetening in its various forms      (sugar, honey, molasses, maple syrup) contributes flavor,      tenderness, moisture and a rich, brown crust. It also      delays staling. In small amounts, sugar increases the      activity of yeast, so it's usually dissolved with the yeast      in warm water. But too much upsets the water balance in the      yeast cells, at which point fermentation declines sharply.      That's why recipes for sweet doughs often call for extra      yeast (and why it's a bad idea to add more sugar to the      dissolving yeast than the directions sug gest). Except in      very sweet doughs, the choice of sweetener doesn't affect      the flavor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Liquid.</strong> Although water is the most common      liquid, others can be substituted-everything from      fruit or vegetable juices to broth or beer. Obviously,      flavor varies. Milk makes the texture softer, delays      staling and creates a rich brown crust.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Et cetera.</strong> Fruits, nuts, seeds, cheese,      vegetables, cornmeal, oats, wheat germ-the list goes      on for flavor, character and fun.    </p>    <h3>      Equipment    </h3>    <p>      Assuming a kitchen stocked with the usual measuring cups      and mixing bowls, only a few extra tools are required.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Thermometer.</strong> Like other living organisms,      yeast cares about temperature: too cool, and it will remain      dormant; too hot, and it will die. The most useful      thermometer is an instant-response one with a metal spike      and a gauge that measures from freezing to boiling (Fig.      3). With it you can check the liquid you add to the yeast      and the place where the dough rises.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dough blade.</strong> Also called a dough scraper      or cutter, this handy tool is a rectangular piece of steel      (about 4" X 5") with a wooden handle (Fig. 4). It is useful      for kneading dough in the early, sticky stages, for      dividing it and for scraping of the kneading surface      afterward.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pans.</strong> Bread bakes well in a variety of      materials. Most widely recommended are dark metal loaf      pans, which absorb heat readily and produce a uniformly      brown crust. Shiny metal pans reflect heat and produce pale      sides and bottom. (If the baked loaf is removed from the      pan and returned to the oven for five or 10 minutes, the      crust will brown up nicely.) Glass baking pans also work      well; lower the heat by 25°F when using them. Recipes      are most apt to call for loaf pans that measure 8" X 4"      (medium) or 9" X 5" (large). You'll also need a baking      sheet for round peasant loaves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oven thermometer.</strong> Equally certain are      death, taxes and an inaccurate oven thermostat. Considering      the odds, an oven thermometer is a good investment, so that      you end up with neither a cinder nor a semibaked lump of      dough.    </p>    <h3>      Techniques    </h3>    <p>      Because of yeast's sensitivity to temperature, all      ingredients need to be at room temperature (except, of      course, the liquid for dissolving the yeast, which should      be warmer). If your whole-wheat flour is stored in the      refrigerator, take it out in time to warm up; if you've      melted butter, let it cool.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Making the dough.</strong> Although details vary,      there are three general methods of adding the yeast to the      other ingredients. Directions vary from cookbook to      cookbook and, frequently, from recipe to recipe.    </p>    <p>      <em>Method 1.</em> Dissolve the yeast in warm (105 ° to      115 °F) water with a small amount of sugar, then add      the other ingredients. Older recipes direct you to let the      dissolved yeast sit for five to 10 minutes, until it      becomes frothy-a means of "proofing" the yeast, or      making certain that it's still alive. These days, when      yeast is virtually always reliable, this delay is simply      unnecessary, unless the pull date has expired or you have      some other reason to question the yeast's viability.    </p>    <p>      <em>Method 2.</em> Mix the yeast with some of the flour and      the other dry ingredients; add hot (120° to 130°F)      liquid to form a batter, then add other ingredients.    </p>    <p>      <em>Method 3.</em> Make a sponge: Combine the yeast, half      the flour and other ingredients (except fat and eggs), and      let it all ferment for several hours or overnight. Then add      the rest of the flour and any other ingredients to form the      dough.    </p>    <p>      Regardless of the method, it is vital to check the      temperature of the liquid before you add it to the yeast.      Once yeast is heat-killed, nothing will resurrect it.    </p>    <h3>      Kneading    </h3>    <p>      Kneading is like dancing: As long as you've got the rhythm,      there's lots of room for individual moves. Do find a work      surface that's the right height. You should be able to      extend your arms downward with palms resting flat on the      surface. Unless you're tall, a kitchen counter is too high;      you won't get full power from your arms. Too low a      worktable will break your back. Sprinkle the surface      lightly with flour, and dump the dough onto it. Dust your      hands lightly with flour, and get it on.    </p>    <p>      Form the dough into a rough ball. Using the heels of your      hands, push into the dough, moving it down and away,      stretching and flattening it (Fig. 5). Then lift the back      end and bring it forward, folding the dough in half (Fig.      6). Give it a quarter turn, and push it out again. Push,      fold, turn-the elements of kneading.    </p>    <p>      As you knead, add sprinkles of flour as necessary, to make      the dough workable. Try not to overdo it; the dough will      become less sticky as you work it, and too much flour will      produce a dry, heavy loaf. It's impossible to specify how      much extra flour should be kneaded in, so recipes give a      range. Flours absorb varying amounts of water, depending on      what type they are, what crop they came from, how they've      been stored and whether the day is humid or dry.    </p>    <p>      At first, when the dough is especially sticky, try for a      fairly light touch, so your hand doesn't become stuck. In      these early stages, a dough blade is helpful; use it to      lift, fold and turn the dough. As it begins to firm up,      your strokes can become more aggressive.    </p>    <p>      Kneading isn't a delicate operation; put your whole body      into it. Some apparently rational experts even suggest that      you periodically lift up the ball of dough and slam it down      on the table, insisting that it will do the dough (and you)      a world of good.    </p>    <p>      When can you stop? The standard estimate is 10 minutes to      knead one loaf, but time varies with the flour, the weather      and the energy of the baker. Most cooks judge by look and      feel.    </p>    <p>      Well-kneaded dough loses its stickiness (whole-wheat stays      tackier) and becomes smooth and shiny. Small blisters      sometimes appear on the surface, especially on white dough.      Most important, the dough (like the gluten) becomes      elastic: It can be stretched into a thin sheet without      tearing (Fig. 7). As you knead, it begins to resist your      advances; when you push, it springs back.    </p>    <h3>      The Dough Also Rises    </h3>    <p>      During rising, the yeast does the work. All you have to do      .is provide the right environment for the yeast to multiply      and metabolize.    </p>    <p>      Lightly grease a large mixing bowl-large enough to allow      the dough to double in size. Round the dough into a ball;      place it in the bowl and turn it once (to grease the      surface lightly, so that it doesn't form a crust); cover      the bowl with plastic wrap, a platter or a damp towel; and      set it in a good rising place: free of drafts (which will      make the dough rise slowly and unevenly), with a      temperature of about 80°F. Slightly cooler will slow      the rising; slightly warmer will speed it up. Just try to      stay in the 80° range. (Whip out your trusty      thermometer.)    </p>    <p>      Good rising places range from the ordinary to the      whimsical. Some cooks put their dough in a gas oven; with      the door closed, the pilot light supplies just the right      warmth. (Make sure to test your oven; many are far too      hot.) Others turn their electric oven to 200°F for one      minute, turn it off, then insert the dough. A few place it      atop a refrigerator or water heater or on a washer or dryer      that's been used recently. Some set it on a heating pad; a      few lay it on a water bed. (Where does your cat nap? It's      probably a warm, draft-free place.)    </p>    <p>      Normally, dough rises until it doubles in bulk, which takes      about an hour. To test whether it's ready, poke two      half-inchdeep holes in it with your fingers (Fig. 8). If      the holes start to fill in, more time is needed. If the      indentations remain and the dough feels spongy, your time      is up.    </p>    <p>      Now punch the dough down (Fig. 9): Double up your fist and      push it into the center of the dough (gently or viciously,      as your conscience dictates). The dough will collapse as      the gas sighs out. Knead for a minute or two to force out      the rest.    </p>    <p>      Most recipes direct you to shape the dough into a loaf and      put it in the pan for the final rising (or "proof"). Some      call for a second rising in the bowl before the proof (a      total of three risings). Whatever the recipe says, you can      always opt for that additional rising. There's plenty of      life in the old fungus yet, and the texture will become      finer with each rising. Since there is more yeast to do the      work, second and third risings take half to two-thirds as      long.    </p>    <p>      Once you decide to let well enough alone, the dough needs      to rest for two or three minutes, so the gluten can relax.      Then shape the loaf-a process as individual as the      bakers who do it. You can simply pat the dough into a      roughly loaflike shape and place it in the pan. Or roll it      flat with a rolling pin and then roll it up like a      jellyroll. You might pat the dough into an oval, fold each      of the long edges into the middle, then fold up the ends      (Fig. 10). A simple method is to fold the oval in half      (Fig. 11), pinch the seam tightly to seal it, tuck the ends      under, and place it, seam side down, in the pan. For a      freeform peasant loaf, just shape the dough into a round,      flatten it slightly on top, and set it aside to proof (Fig.      12).    </p>    <p>      The dough is now ready for its final rising. Set it in the      same kind of place where it rose before, until it doubles      in bulk. (Try to select your pans so that the kneaded dough      doesn't fill them more than two-thirds full; otherwise,      it's likely to rise more than an inch above the      pans-the desirable height.) If your loaf has risen      particularly well, and looks as if it's bursting at the      seams, make a few slashes across the top with a very sharp      knife or razor blade (Fig. 13). If the loaf continues      rising in the oven-a phenomenon known as oven spring,      a baker's joy that occurs when everything has gone      absolutely right-the slashes will allow the loaf to      expand without tearing.    </p>    <h3>      Baking    </h3>    <p>      Try not to open the oven door for the first 15 or 20      minutes; you can instantly lose as much as 25% of the heat.      Second, rely on your own on-site evaluation of whether it's      actually done.    </p>    <p>      The top crust should be golden brown. Now check the bottom:      With oven mitts on, turn the loaf out into one of your      hands. When it slides out easily, that's a good sign; as      bread cooks, it shrinks away from the sides of the pan. Tap      the bottom crust with a fingernail; the loaf should sound      hollow. A dull, liquid thud says you're holding uncooked      dough. Squeeze the sides. If the bread bounces back, it's      probably done. If it retains the impressions of your      fingers, it's probably not. If your loaf fails these tests,      return it to the pan and the pan to the oven for five      minutes, then check again. Cool the finished loaf on a wire      rack; on a solid surface, escaping steam will condense and      produce a soggy bottom.    </p>    <p>      A really silly piece of advice: Don't slice the bread until      it's completely cool-that is, for two or three hours.      Sure, right. OK, at least wait 30 minutes, if you can, and      resign yourself to a soggy texture even then. (It will      improve in a couple of hours.) A still-warm loaf doesn't      cut so much as it tears-a minuscule consideration      when compared to the allure of fresh, warm bread. Whenever      you eat it, don't wrap the remainder in any airtight way      until it's completely cool; otherwise, the steam will      soften the loaf and encourage mold.    </p>    <h3>      Recipes    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Whole-Wheat Batter Bread</strong>    </p>    <p>      Batter breads involve no kneading; the gluten is activated      solely by beating. Thus, their texture is open and coarse.      Their flavor, however, can be exceptionally good.    </p>    <p>      1 package active dry yeast<br />      1'/4 cups warm water (105°-115°F)<br />      2 tablespoons honey<br />      2 tablespoons butter or mar garine, melted and cooled to      room temperature<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1 1/2 cups white flour<br />      1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour    </p>    <p>      In large mixing bowl, add yeast to water and stir to      dissolve. Add honey, and stir until dissolved. Add butter      or margarine, salt, white flour and 1/2 cup wholewheat      flour. With electric mixer, beat on low speed until      blended. Then beat at high speed 1 minute. Scrape bowl;      beat 1 minute more. Stir in remaining flour with wooden      spoon. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 45      minutes.    </p>    <p>      Grease an 8" X 4" loaf pan. Deflate batter by stirring 30      strokes with a wooden spoon. Spoon batter into pan. Cover      and let rise 30 to 40 minutes, or until batter rises just      to rim of pan (not above the rim, for batter breads). Bake      in preheated 375°F oven for 40 minutes, or until done.      Cool on wire rack. Makes 1 loaf.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Basic White Bread</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 package dry yeast<br />      1 teaspoon sugar<br />      1/4 cup warm water (105°-115°F)<br />      3 tablespoons sugar<br />      1 tablespoon salt<br />      1 3/4 cups milk, room tem perature<br />      3 tablespoons butter, melted<br />      6 to 6 1/2 cups unbleached or bread flour    </p>    <p>      In large mixing bowl, stir yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar into      water until dissolved. Add remaining sugar, salt, milk,      butter and 1 1/2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed with      electric mixer 2 minutes, or 200 strokes by hand. Stir in      enough remaining flour to make a workable dough, adding      flour by quarter cupfuls toward the end. Turn dough out      onto lightly floured surface, and knead 10 minutes, or      until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl, turning      once to coat. Cover and let rise in warm, draft-free place      until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down, knead 2 or      3 minutes, and divide in half. Let dough rest 2 or 3      minutes, then shape into loaves and place in 2 greased 8" X      4" loaf pans. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 45      minutes to an hour. Bake in preheated 375°F oven 35-40      minutes, or until done. Makes 2 loaves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Honey Grain Bread</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 packages dry yeast<br />      1/2 cup warm water<br />      (105°-115°F)<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      1/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed<br />      1 3/4 cups milk, room temperature<br />      1/4 cup butter, melted<br />      1 tablespoon salt<br />      1 1/2 cups rye flour<br />      2 1/2 cups unbleached or bread flour<br />      2 1/2 to 3 cups whole-wheat flour<br />      1/2 cup raisins    </p>    <p>      In large mixing bowl, stir yeast into water until      dissolved. Stir in honey, brown sugar, milk, butter, salt,      1 cup rye flour, 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wholewheat      flour. Beat at medium speed with electric mixer 2 minutes,      or 200 strokes by hand. Stir in raisins, remaining rye      flour, remaining white flour and enough whole-wheat flour      to make dough. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead      10-15 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place in      greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let rise in warm,      draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.      Punch down, and knead for 2 or 3 minutes. Divide in half,      and let rest for 2 or 3 minutes. Shape into round loaves,      and place on a large baking sheet that has been greased and      sprinkled with cornmeal. Let rise until doubled in bulk,      about 1 hour. Bake in preheated 375°F oven 35-40      minutes, or until done. Cool on racks. Makes 2 large      loaves.    </p>    <h3>      SPEEDING IT UP    </h3>    <p>      ALTHOUGH THE ACTUAL work of bread making is relative ly      brief, the risings and baking keep you in or around the      house for three hours or more. With occasional help from      modern technology, it doesn't have to take that long.    </p>    <p>      <strong>1. Food processor.</strong> A food processor      doesn't provide much in the way of sensuous pleasure, but      it's fast. Instead of a minimum of 10 minutes for hand      kneading, the machine takes about 45 to <em>60      seconds.</em>    </p>    <p>      While machines vary (consult the owner's manual), the      general pattern is this: Dissolve the yeast in warm water.      Place the dry ingredients in the work bowl, and pulse to      blend. Add dissolved yeast; then, with machine running, add      other liquid ingredients slowly until the dough forms a      solid mass. Process 45 to 60 seconds more.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2. Fast-acting yeast.</strong> Recently, genetic      engineers have developed new strains of yeast that cut the      rising time in half (Fleischmann's RapidRise and Red Star's      Quick-Rise). Since the risings are the most time-consuming      part of the process, the savings are significant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3. Microwave.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Few people would find bread baked in a microwave      acceptable; the dough forms no crust, and it comes out of      the oven the same color as when it went in. But some      longtime bakers use these ovens to raise their bread, thus      reducing rising time by twothirds. Consult your manual, but      here's how it generally works:    </p>    <p>      Microwave three cups of water in a one-quart measure until      it's steaming hot. Cover the bowl of dough with a towel,      and put it in the oven next to the water. Microwave at 10%      power (the lowest possible setting) for 18 to 20 minutes.      Check the risen dough in the usual way.    </p>    <p>      When this technique fails, it's usually because the oven      can't maintain a low enough power. If the microwave can't      be set at 10% if, for example, it registers only low,      medium and high-forget it. You'll end up with an      unrisen, semibaked blob.    </p>    <p>      Among both expert bakers and devoted eaters, evaluations of      these techniques vary widely. Some argue that all three      compromise flavor, texture and keeping quality; others      maintain that the final loaf is every bit as good as a      traditional one. Considering the time savings involved,      it's probably worth your while to find out what you think.    </p>
