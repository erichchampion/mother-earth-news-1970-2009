                    <p>      <em>Even the most well-bred person may be subject to a fit      of bad behavior at holiday parties.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>One may suffer from an overdose, not necessarily of      alcohol, but of frankness, cuddliness, reminiscences or      other enemies of the social structure."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>- Miss Manners</em>    </p>    <p>      ANY CELEBRATION OF NEW YEAR'S Day attracts a mixed crowd.    </p>        <p>      With another year irretrievably gone, some guests are sunk      in a wholly satisfying depression. They've just inventoried      the past 12 months and found opportunities lost, things      undone: roads untraveled, pounds unshed, books unwritten,      children unreformed. Ten minutes along these lines, and      they're ready for strong drink and chocolate.    </p>    <p>      A second faction is in the spine-stiffening grip of New      Year's resolutions. No more smoking, drinking, feasting,      debauching. This year they're going to get it right:      Spartan self-denial, meteoric accomplishment, impeccable      nutrition. And they're starting now.    </p>    <p>      A third group arrives mellow. They've come to rueful terms      with life-probably the night before-and they      expect this year to resemble the last: a mixture of success      and failure, gain and loss. Buoyant with good cheer and      fellow feeling, they're ready to celebrate a new beginning,      another chance.    </p>    <p>      Given such a diversity of guests, it's a challenge to see      to it that everyone has a good time. Happily, there are      precedents. Across the centuries, humanity has celebrated      this oldest and most universal of festivals-the      renewal of time-with the same three themes: loss,      resolution and joy.    </p>        <h3>      Happy Vernal Equinox    </h3>    <p>      Beginnings-whether of life, love or      disaster-are difficult to pinpoint. At various times      and places, the start of a new year has been assigned to      harvesttime, the winter solstice (December 21), the summer      solstice (June 21), the autumnal equinox (September 21) and      the vernal equinox (March 21).    </p>    <p>      The Romans were the first to designate January 1 as New      Year's Day. Traditionally, their year had begun with the      vernal equinox. But in 153 B.C., the newly elected consuls      decided that, since they would take office on January 1, a      new cycle actually began then. Thus did an agricultural and      seasonal festival become a civil celebration (an early      instance of the federal government rearranging holidays to      suit itself ). Europeans maintained their springtime      observances until 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII reinstituted      the first of January, despite its pre-Christian      connotations. Catholic Europe followed immediately;      Protestant countries took a few hundred years to come      around.    </p>    <h3>      Good-by and Good Luck    </h3>    <p>      There have always been New Year's demons to exorcise.      Ancient cultures were convinced that as the old year      weakened and died, evil spirits grew stronger and more      dangerous. For safety's sake, the old year had to be      hastened along and the demons driven off: Noise helped:      shouts, drums, cymbals, gongs, whistles and, later, church      bells, gunpowder and firecrackers. So did fire. On the last      day of the year, fires were extinguished and then rekindled      the next morning from a new, holy flame. The Creek Indians      simply burned everything-clothes, furniture, uneaten corn      from the previous year-and started over.    </p>    <p>      It's always seemed a perfect time to settle old scores. In      any number of cultures, all outstanding debts had to be      paid and all borrowed items returned on the last day of the      year. The Iroquois cleaned their slates more dramatically.      At year's end, men and women disguised themselves and      proceeded to run amok through the village, invading      wigwams, smashing whatever came to hand; throwing ice      water, dirt and hot ashes on anyone who had offended them      during the last 12 months. It was generally assumed that      people were out of their senses during this time and thus      not responsible for their actions. The general lunacy was      followed by a general confession of sins, no doubt      appropriate.    </p>    <p>      Sensible people have always resolved to make the next year      better. An old and tenacious belief is that the first day      sets the pattern for the next 364 and thus had better go      well. On this one day, the Romans suspended all litigation      and settled out of court. The Germans feasted as hugely,      and dressed as richly, as possible, in order to give the      appearance of people upon whom good fortune was about to      descend. Americans were careful. In prudent households, new      calendars were not hung until sunup on January 1. No      clothes were washed, lest a year of hard work follow.      Visitors were invited, for a great many brought great good      fortune-unless the first happened to be a woman, and then a      year of bad luck followed hard upon her heels. For some      reason, it was lucky to bor row salt. (Of course, a      considerate woman sent husband or son for it, especially      early in the day.)    </p>    <p>      Traditionally, joy in the year's rebirth has brought gifts,      visitors and food. The giftgiving tradition began with      exchanges of good luck tokens: boughs of sacred trees      (Romans and Druids); eggs, the symbols of fertility      (Persians); gloves or pins-or, in their stead, "glove      money" or "pin money" (British). In America, the English      colonists continued to exchange presents on New Year's Day      until, under Dutch and German influence, Christmas became      the great giftgiving occasion.    </p>    <p>      Paying visits is perhaps the oldest and best established      New Year's custom. Romans, Europeans, Americans-all have      celebrated the new year by renewing ties and settling      differences with family and friends. It seems appropriate.      When embarking upon an unpredictable and possibly dangerous      journey, one should gather one's fellow travelers about,      for a mutual "bon voyage."    </p>    <h3>      The Menu    </h3>    <p>      Of course, they all have to be fed. And if the feast is to      be consistent with 40 centuries of tradition, it will allow      the dejected to chase their demons, the newly perfect to      sustain their illusions and the jubilant to express their      joy. Quite a strain on hospitality.    </p>    <p>      Modern technology helps. In the great New Year's tradition      of bombast and fireworks, television offers 12 hours of      parades and football: the perfect staging for an open      house.    </p>    <p>      Drop by, one can say to a dozen or so friends and      relatives, anytime after 1:00.    </p>    <p>      We'll have a little desultory conversation about the      passage of time and the meaning of life. We'll watch some      television, compare the atrocities of parade commentators      and quarterbacks. We'll drink a little fresh orange      juice-either straight and pure, if that's the way      we're feeling, or mixed half-and-half with champagne, if we      need a little comfort. Later, we'll wander over to the      buffet table. Football, friends, food-sample at will.    </p>    <p>      The accompanying menu allows guests to forage according to      their moods. The seasonally depressed can head straight for      the glazed ham, potato salad and apple cake. The resolute      can dine lean and mean on salmon mousse, spinach salad and      fruit.    </p>    <p>      And those just happy to be alive? They'll take care of      themselves. They'll eat anything they like.    </p>    <h3>      Maple-Glazed Ham    </h3>    <p>      1 country-curedham<br />      3 1/4 cups apple cider, divided<br />      1/2 cup maple syrup<br />      Whole cloves    </p>    <p>      Soak ham overnight in cold water. The next day, scrub ham      with vegetable brush, and rinse.    </p>    <p>      Put ham and 3 cups cider in large pot, and add water to      cover. Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer, and cook 15      minutes per pound. After ham has cooled in its cooking      water, cut off heavy skin.    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 325°F. Place ham in roasting pan, and      baste with a mixture of 1/2 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup      cider. Bake 1 hour, brushing frequently with the syrup      mixture. Remove ham from oven, score it diagonally with a      knife in two directions, stud with cloves, brush again with      syrup, and return to the oven for another 20 minutes.    </p>    <h3>      Warm Potato Salad    </h3>    <p>      5 pounds potatoes<br />      4 hardcooked eggs, chopped<br />      1/2 cup finely chopped bacon<br />      1 large onion, finely chopped<br />      3 tablespoons flour<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br />      2 tablespoons sugar<br />      1/2 teaspoon fresh black pepper<br />      1 cup cider vinegar<br />      1/2 cup water<br />      1 teaspoon celery seed<br />      1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley    </p>    <p>      Cook potatoes in boiling water until tender but firm.      Drain, peel, and cut up into large bowl. Add eggs.    </p>    <p>      Saute bacon in a heavy skillet until crisp. Add onion;      saute 1 minute. Remove bacon and onions with slotted spoon,      and add to potatoes. Stir flour, salt, sugar and pepper      into bacon drippings; cook, stirring constantly, for a      minute or two. Add vinegar and water, and cook, stirring      frequently, 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Pour enough dressing over potatoes to moisten them      thoroughly; discard any excess. Sprinkle salad with celery      seed and parsley, and toss until well mixed. Keep salad      warm. Serves 10-12.    </p>    <h3>      Apple Cake    </h3>    <p>      4 cups peeled, finely diced apples<br />      1 cup granulated sugar<br />      1 cup brown sugar<br />      1 cup vegetable oil<br />      1 cup chopped nuts<br />      2 eggs, lightly beaten<br />      2 teaspoons vanilla<br />      2 cups whole-wheat flour<br />      2 teaspoons baking soda<br />      2 teaspoons cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt    </p>    <p>      Grease and flour a large tube pan, and preheat oven to      350°F. Stir together first 7 ingredients. Combine      flour, soda, cinnamon and salt, mix well, and add to apple      mixture. Pour batter into pan and bake 1 hour. Allow to      cool before serving.    </p>    <h3>      Light Salmon Mousse    </h3>    <p>      2 envelopes (2 tablespoons)unflavored gelatin<br />      1 1/4 cups cold water<br />      2 16-ounce cans salmon, drained, skin re moved, bones      crushed<br />      2 cups plain low-fat yogurt<br />      2 tablespoons mayonnaise (optional)<br />      2 tablespoons fresh snipped dill or 1 teaspoon dried      dillweed<br />      2 tablespoons grated onion<br />      2 tablespoons lemon juice<br />      2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley<br />      1 teaspoon snipped fresh chives (optional)<br />      Several dashes cayenne<br />      White or black pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      Sprinkle gelatin on cold water in small saucepan. Let stand      5 minutes to soften. Then heat water until gelatin melts.    </p>    <p>      While gelatin softens, puree 1 can salmon with 1 cup yogurt      and 1 tablespoon mayonnaise in blender. Transfer puree to      large bowl, and repeat the process with remaining salmon,      yogurt and mayonnaise. Combine two purees.    </p>    <p>      When gelatin has completely dissolved, pour it into the      salmon puree, add remaining ingredients, and combine      thoroughly. Place bowl in refrigerator until mousse is      partially set (mixture should form a heap when dropped from      a spoon). Lightly grease a 6-cup mold with vegetableoil      spray. Pour in the partly gelled mixture. Chill until firm,      about 3 hours.    </p>    <p>      At serving time, unmold mousse by inverting it onto a      platter. It should not be necessary to dip mold in hot      water, but if it does not unmold, hold in a bowl of      lukewarm water for 10 seconds.    </p>    <h3>      Citrus and Spinach Salad    </h3>    <p>      Since this recipe serves 4, you'll need to increase it to      accommodate the number of guests.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dressing:</em>    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup grapefruit juice<br />      2 tablespoons prepared mustard<br />      1/4 cup olive oil<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      2 tablespoons poppy seeds<br />      2 tablespoons grated onion<br />      1/4 teaspoon salt, if desired<br />      Freshly ground black pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      <em>Salad:</em>    </p>    <p>      4 cupspacked spinach leaves, well washed<br />      1 cup orange sections<br />      1 cup grapefruit sections<br />      1/2 cup red onion rings    </p>    <p>      In bowl, combine all dressing ingredients. Chill. At      serving time, place salad ingredients in salad bowl, and      toss with enough chilled dressing to moisten.    </p>    <h3>      Fruit With Grenadine    </h3>    <p>      10 cups prepared fruit-fresh, frozen or canned in its      own juice-cut into bite-size pieces<br />      1 12-ounce bottle grenadine*    </p>    <p>      Place fruit in serving bowl. Add enough grenadine to      moisten fruit thoroughly. Chill. Serves 10-15.    </p>    <p>      * Grenadine is usually found in the mixed-drink sections of      grocery stores.    </p>
