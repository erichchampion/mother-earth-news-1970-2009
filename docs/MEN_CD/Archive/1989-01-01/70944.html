                <p>      Mother's Children    </p>            <p>      This enterprising youngster is making money making      banks.</p>     <h5 id="byline"> By Jeffrey Hanning    </h5>    <p>      I'M 13 YEARS OLD AND ALREADY in the banking business. I      build and sell musical banks.    </p>    <p>      My business started by accident a year and a half ago. I      had just finished Cub Scout day camp, school was still      several weeks away, and I was bored, bored, bored. Then I      happened to remember a wood project my mom had bought for      me. I followed one of the patterns and built a house-shaped      savings bank.    </p>    <p>      My grandmother, Fern Henry, suggested I make 10 more. She      said she'd put them in the showcase in her art studio, and      maybe some art students would buy them. She also suggested      I charge $10 each. That sounded good to me!    </p>    <p>      I took my plans to my grandfather's workshop, and we found      enough scraps to make 10 banks. In the meantime, I had      found a catalogue that sold some musical-bank insets that      looked perfect-every time you dropped in a coin, they      played a tune. I ordered 10 "Old MacDonald Had a Farm"      insets. <em>[Editor's Note: Jeffrey gets his musical insets      and the plastic stoppers for the bank bottoms from National      Artcraft Co., 23456 Mercantile Rd., Beachwood, OH      44122.]</em> I also decided to add a porch, a green shrub      (cut from a piece of sponge) and a small wooden dog with a      string leash.    </p>    <p>      I was ready, but, boy, making 10 banks was a lot different      than building just one. I was too short to use the band saw      unless I stood on a box. When I tried to nail the sides      together, I needed six hands instead of two. I must have      used a box of nails -every other one would bend. I needed      <em>help.</em>    </p>    <p>      When I was all finished, I was so disgusted I thought, "No      more of this for me." But then all 10 banks sold before art      class even started. I was rich, I was rich!    </p>    <p>      That is how my business, "A WHALE OF A DEAL (for you to      start saving)," started.    </p>    <p>      My first production run after that was 20 banks. My next      was 40. My most recent run, I made 140 banks. I have seven      models now, based on different musical tunes:: "Old      MacDonald," "Send in the Clowns," "Rock A-Bye Baby," "Over      the Rainbow," "Teddy Bears' Picnic," "Twinkle, Twinkle,      Little Star" and "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."    </p>        <p>      To get the help I need, I trade out work with my      grandparents. My grandfather, Lawrence Henry, cuts out the      wood pieces on his table saw (he thinks I'm much too young      to use it myself). I nail them together-sometimes      with a little help. I also sand all the banks once after      assembly and then again after putting on the base coat of      paint. Sometimes Grandfather will do the first sanding on      the banks, if he's not too busy. My grandmother helps with      the detail painting.    </p>    <p>      In return, I help them. There's always work to be done      around their shop or studio. There's also yard work. If      grandfather needs some mowing or edging done, I'll do that      while he is working the big saw for me. (Of course, I also      help even when I am not trading out.)    </p>    <p>      My little sister, Laurie, helps some, too. She paints the      base coat on the chimneys. I pay her 5 cents per chimney,      then I sand it and paint the final details.    </p>    <p>      I have never advertised. I sell mostly by word of mouth and      through two stores, one here in McKinney, Texas, and      another in a nearby town. At present, I am saving up for a      computer, perhaps an IBM PC Model 25. I've just started      studying computer in school, and if my business keeps      growing, I'll certainly need a computer. I've already sold      210 banks, with another 100 currently in progress. Each one      costs me $3 in supplies, and I sell them now for $12 each.      So at this point, I figure I've made a net profit of      $1,890.    </p>    <p>      I've had many interesting experiences since I started this,      such as the time one kid asked <em>me</em> for a job. That      made me feel about 10 feet tall-he was about my age,      and here he was asking me for a job. I told him, maybe      later, but that my business wasn't quite that big yet.    </p>    <p>      Actually, I'd rather he go figure out a business of his      own. In fact, I hope my example will help lots of other      kids start their own businesses.    </p>    <p>      Maybe even you.    </p>    <p>      <em>MOTHER</em> <em>is glad to publish well-written      articles from young people concerning their original      projects or small businesses.
