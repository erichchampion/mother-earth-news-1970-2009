                <p>      Kitchen Garden    </p>		    <p>      Crispy and flavorful, andoffering choices galore.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Sara Pacher		</h5>    <p>      LETTUCE IS EASY TOGROW. THERE are dozens and dozens of      varieties to choose from, and, with proper planning, this      traditionally cool-weather crop can be cultivated almost      year-round in much of the country. When served straight      from the garden, lettuce, like freshly picked corn, has a      sweet flavor and crispy texture that can't be matched by      store-bought versions.    </p>    <p>      Considering all this, I'm always astounded at the prices      shoppers seem willing to pay for the very limited lettuce      choices offered by most supermarkets. With a little effort,      almost anyone-even city dwellers-can enjoy      homegrown salad, since this compact vegetable can be raised      in pots, window boxes, flower beds or tiny plots of earth.    </p>    <p>      The word <em>lettuce</em> (and the French for lettuce,      <em>laitue)</em> comes from the Old French      <em>laitues,</em> meaning "milky," which refers to the      white sap that is particularly evident as the plant passes      its prime. The generic name for lettuce, <em>Lactuca      sativa,</em> reflects this, too ( <em>lac</em> being the      Latin for "milk"). Lettuce is thought to have originated in      the Middle East, and it owes its ease of cultivation to an      Asian ancestor common to all <em>Lactucas,</em> the weed      known as prickly lettuce <em>(L. Serriola).</em> As early      as 550 B.C., this vegetable, then known as <em>kahn,</em>      adorned the tables of Persian monarchs, and King      Nebuchadnezzar grew it in his famous hanging gardens of      Babylon. The Chinese and the Greeks (including Aristotle)      lauded its virtues, and the Romans liked it served as the      first course of their sumptuous meals. (They considered it      both an aphrodisiac and a sedative.) Centuries later,      Columbus took lettuce seeds with him to the Bahamas, and      the plants were also grown at Henry VIII's Hampton Court,      though his sixth wife, Catherine Parr, had her lettuce      shipped in from Holland.    </p><h3>What toGrow</h3>    <p>      Over the hundreds of years that lettuce has been      cultivated, several distinct types have evolved. With the      exception of crisphead (often called iceberg) lettuce, this      favorite ingredient of many salads contains high amounts of      vitamin A, more B vitamins than most vegetables and a      little vitamin C.    </p>    <p>      Cabbagelike crisp-head lettuce is the kind most often found      in supermarkets. Though it's the least nutritious, the      ability of some cultivars to stand up to hot weather and to      keep and ship well has led to their being preferred by      commercial growers. Great Lakes (matures in 90 days), in      particular, is tolerant of hot weather, and Premier Great      Lakes is resistant to both heat and tip burn.    </p>    <p>      Romaine,or cos, lettuce-whose tall, crunchy,      spoon-shaped leaves allow in enough light to boost its      nutritional value-was developed in Italy and      introduced to France by Rabelais. Heat-tolerant and easy to      grow, the very big-leaved types produce crisp, white hearts      that can be substituted for celery. Paris White (80 days),      which has a flavor like Brussels chicory, is a favorite and      very reliable cos variety. Other popular romaines are Dark      Green Cos, Parris Island Cos and an early dwarf with a      sweet taste called Little Gem.    </p>    <p>      Butterhead, or Boston, lettuce has soft, tender, rich green      outer leaves and white to yellowish hearts. Aside from      being nutritious, it's considered by many people to be the      best lettuce in taste and texture. Small, fast-maturing      types (60 to 75 days)-such as Buttercrunch, Bibb and      Tom Thumb-need cool, springlike weather and excellent      soil to produce well, but Deer Tongue (also called      Matchless) is more heat-resistant. Other butterhead      favorites are Dark Green Boston, Fordhook (both take 80      days to mature) and Summer Bibb (62 days).    </p>    <p>      Loose-leaf lettuce can tolerate much warmer temperatures      than heading lettuce, and because it's also nutritious and      fast-growing, and comes in so many different varieties,      it's ideal for home gardens. Some types form fairly compact      heads, but most are characterized by loose, open growth      habits and colorful leaves that range from frilly to      smooth. For example, Salad Bowl (heat resistant, 45 days),      Black-Seeded Simpson (crispy, delicately flavored, 45 days)      and Grand Rapids (45 days) all have dense clumps of      crinkled, light green leaves, while the heat-resistant      Oakleaf (40 days) and Ruby (45 days) have bronze or reddish      foliage. There's another advantage to looseleaf types: You      can harvest the outer leaves, and the plants will keep      producing new leaves to be picked later.    </p>    <p>      There are also numerous dwarf varieties suitable for      containers, small gardens and one-or two-person households.    </p>    <p>      Stem lettuce, or celtuce (80 days), is cultivated like      other types, but while bolting (going to seed) makes other      lettuces bitter, it's encouraged with this variety. Though      the leaves of celtuce can be used in salads, it's grown      primarily for its stem; it has a crunchy taste similar to      hearts of palm and can act as a celery substitute.    </p>    <h3>How toGrow</h3>		 <p>      As mentioned before, lettuce prefers cool temperatures and      is considered to be a spring crop. However, unless your      summers are extremely hot or your winters incredibly cold,      there are fairly simple ways to extend the lettuce season.    </p>    <p>      For very early spring lettuce, sow heading types outdoors      in midautumn in cold frames or under hot caps. (Try cutting      out the bottoms of one-gallon plastic milk jugs, and set      these, with the caps removed, over the young plants.) In      mild climates, a very heavy mulch might be adequate to      protect the plants from the cold.    </p>    <p>      You can start head or cos lettuce indoors four to six weeks      before the last frost date; try three small sowings at      weekly intervals, and set out the seedling batches      successively as soon as the ground is workable. At that      time, sow some seeds of the same varieties directly in the      garden. The soil must be at least 35Â°F for germination,      which should occur in six to 12 days.    </p>    <p>      This is the time, too, to plant quick-growing leaf-lettuce      seeds-either repeating the procedure at 10-day to      two-week intervals, or sowing all your leaf lettuce at once      and harvesting the outside leaves as the plants grow.    </p>    <p>      As the weather warms up, make new lettuce plantings in      shadier locations (shade cloth can work wonders), and      utilize some of the newer heat-resistant summer varieties      that are less likely to bolt-particularly if given      plenty of water.    </p>    <p>      For an autumn harvest, switch, in midsummer, back to the      heading or cos types, making successive sowings. (Again,      shade cloth helps seeds germinate and keeps the soil      moist.) Harvest those that mature before the first frost,      and-in milder climates-protect immature lettuce      heads under glass or plastic for winter harvesting. In      colder areas, move immature plants to a greenhouse or to      sunny windows for winter and early spring eating, or sow      fresh seeds in indoor containers.    </p>    <p>      When garden space is limited, lettuce can be intercropped      with slower-growing vegetables, such as beets, carrots,      cabbage or, for shade, corn. Or use it as a "catch crop,"      planting in areas that are temporarily available before      sowing or after harvesting other vegetables.    </p>    <p>      Wherever lettuce is grown, it needs a humus-rich,      moisture-holding, but well-drained, soil abundant in      leaf-producing nitrogen. In the fall, many gardeners spade      in a pound of fresh manure per square foot, letting it age      over winter for spring planting. Some merely mix in aged      manure and compost just before sowing their seeds. (Blood      meal is another favorite fertilizer.) The pH content should      be 6.5 to 7.0, so work in lime if necessary.    </p>    <p>      Indoors or out, sow the tiny seeds only 1/4-inch deep and      as thinly as possible. Leave 18 inches between rows. Since      lettuce needs a little light to germinate, some gardeners      broadcast the seeds and rake over enough soil to barely      cover them.    </p>    <p>      A small seed packet generally plants a 100-foot row, which      will produce approximately 80 heads, or about 50 pounds of      leaf lettuce. Germination rate is more than 80%, and seeds      remain viable for five to six years. Lettuce, however,      needs cool temperatures to germinate. Therefore, if the      earth is very warm, presprout the seeds for five days in      the refrigerator on wet blotting paper, or mix them with a      little moist peat moss and perlite.    </p>    <p>      Transplant seedlings to the outdoors when they are no more      than two inches high. Handle them very carefully, since a      damaged seedling is vulnerable to the disease gray mold. Do      this in late afternoon (and water immediately), or else      provide these young, wilt-prone plants with some kind of      temporary shading.    </p>    <p>      In the garden, thin seedlings when they have four leaves.      Head or romaine lettuce should stand 12 to 16 inches apart      (nine inches for dwarf types). The same applies for leaf      lettuce if you intend to pick the outer leaves over a long      period, but if you'll be harvesting whole plants, four-inch      spacing is adequate. In fact, many leaf lettuces are      planted in thick rows or patches and not thinned at all.      Thin butterhead lettuce until the plants are three to five      inches apart.    </p>    <p>      Because lettuce has shallow roots, keep the surface soil      moist but not soggy. Lettuce is 90% water, however, so try      to give the plants three to four gallons of water per      square yard weekly in dry weather. To prevent diseases,      water in the mornings on sunny days, so that the leaves are      dry by evening. In hot weather, the best way to assure      surface moisture-and clean leaves-is with a      mulch of grass clippings, hay, straw or the      like-especially if applied just after a good rain.      Lettuce beds are great places to use soaker hoses or      watering wands. Lettuce doesn't compete well with weeds,      but its surface roots are easily damaged by hoeing; again,      weed-suffocating mulch is the answer.    </p><h3>What to Watch For</h3>    <p>      There are a number of insects and diseases that can attack      lettuce, but if you plant in a rich, well-drained soil and      keep your lettuce weed-free, you'll seldom encounter      serious problems in the lettuce patch. Among the most      common pests are cutworms, which chew through the stalks of      the main plants. To prevent them altogether, put paper,      plastic, cardboard or metal collars around the plants.      Lettuce-loving slugs, which nibble on leaf ribs during the      night, are best caught and disposed of at that time. If you      lay out boards, the slugs will hide under them during the      day and can be collected, or you can put out saucers of      beer to attract and drown them. Limestone or wood ashes      sprinkled over the soil around the plants will also      discourage slugs. If aphids become a problem, attack them      with hose or garlic sprays, diatomaceous earth, wood ashes      or ladybugs.    </p>    <p>      About the only disease you're likely to see is rot, which      turns a plant black and foul smelling. Soggy soil and      crowded plants are usually the culprits. Crop rotation is a      preventive measure. Gray mold turns areas on lower leaves      grayish green or dark brown and is usually caused by damp,      overcast weather. The only solution here is to pull up the      infected plants and dispose of them well outside of the      garden area.    </p><h3>How to Harvest and Use</h3>    <p>      The quality of mature plants deteriorates quickly if      lettuce is not used at its prime, so make extra plantings      rather than trying to extend a harvest. To test the      firmness of heading types, press down gently on the heart      of the lettuce with the back of your hand. Don't pinch it,      as this can bruise the heart. Picking lettuce in the early      morning preserves the crispness it acquires overnight. Use      a sharp knife to cut the heads just below the lowest      leaves, or pull the plants out by the roots. For the best      flavor and nutrition, use lettuce immediately. If that's      not possible, wash it thoroughly but briefly in cold water,      and drain it well. Refrigerated, most lettuce will keep for      up to two weeks.    </p>    <p>      As mentioned, loose-leaf lettuce can be harvested many      times if only the lower leaves are picked, and pinching off      the top center of the plant will discourage it from      bolting. There will be a subtle elongation of the plant      just as it begins to bolt. At that point, it will start to      form a bitter white sap. Should any plants start to go to      seed, pull up and discard them-unless, of course, you're a      seed saver. In that case, choose the last plants to bolt,      as quickness to bolt is a bad trait. Also remember that any      lettuce can cross with other varieties as well as with wild      lettuce.    </p>    <p>      And don't think of lettuce as just a salad ingredient. It      can be lightly steamed, and, as the accompanying recipes      demonstrate, you can bake it or use it in soups.    </p><h3>Lettuce and Peas French Style</h3>    <p>      1head Boston lettuce<br />      2 pounds unshelled peas<br />      4 scallions, chopped<br />      1 small bunch mint<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon pepper<br />      6 tablespoons water<br />    </p>    <p>      Wash lettuce, but don't drain. Strip off large outer      leaves, and put in saucepan. Shell peas, and mix with      scallions, 1 tablespoon chopped mint, salt and pepper. Put      on top of lettuce. Shred remaining lettuce, and put on top      of pea mixture. Add water, cover pan, bring slowly to a      boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently for 15 minutes or      until peas are tender. Transfer to serving bowl, and      garnish with mint sprigs. Serves 4.    </p><h3>Spiced LettuceSoup</h3>    <p>      1 large head lettuce, washed and shredded<br />      1 medium-sized onion, grated<br />      1/2 lemon<br />      1 teaspoon grated nutmeg<br />      2 1/2 cups chicken stock<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon pepper<br />      1 cup undiluted evaporated milk<br />      2 tablespoons margarine<br />      2 tablespoons flour<br />    </p>    <p>      Mix lettuce and onion together in saucepan. Grate in the      rind of 1/2 lemon, and squeeze in juice. Add nutmeg,      chicken stock, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover pan,      and simmer for 15 minutes. Sieve or blend soup, return to      pan, and stir in evaporated milk. Reheat to a simmer, and      thicken with blended margarine and flour. Serve garnished      with parsley, with hot homemade bread on the side. Serves      4.    </p><h3>Susan Says</h3>    <p>      MOTHER'S GARDENER,SUSAN Sides, tells why lettuce, these      days, need never be a humdrum crop:    </p>    <p>      This past year we grew some 18 varieties of lettuce at the      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> gardens, and found that this vegetable's      astounding array of shapes and colors makes it an excellent      edible ornamental. From seed to mature plant in an average      of two months, lettuce quickly creates borders and blocks      of color that used to be reserved for nonedible edging      plants.    </p>    <p>      Pandion (a mild, lime green butterhead from Johnny's) was      so beautiful that none of my lettuce-hungry friends (nor      myself could bear to harvest a head on the first planting.      Royal Oakleaf from The Cook's Garden stoi cally resisted      bolting and garnered oohs and ahs from each and every      visitor. Little Gem (also known as Sugar Cos) from      Bountiful Gardens is a mild-tasting mini-romaine that wowed      even those who were turned off by store-bought types.    </p>    <p>      Mesclun-growing (long-practiced in Europe where salad      greens are darker and much more diverse in texture and      taste) is an art being popularized in this country through      small seed houses with access to excellent European seed.      "Cutting mix" is another name for mesclun, which perhaps      gives you a clearer idea of the concept. A variety of      saladgreen seeds that may include lettuces, chervil or      other herbs, and chicories and arugula or other bitter      greens are mixed together and sown en masse. The resulting      blend of colors and textures creates a most interesting      pattern in the garden, as well as variety in the salad      bowl.    </p>
