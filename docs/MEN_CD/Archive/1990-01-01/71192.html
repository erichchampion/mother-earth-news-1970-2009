                <p><strong>KITCHEN GARDEN</strong></p>		    <h5 id="byline">      by Sara Pacher    </h5>		 <p><strong>      It could be the most important plant in the garden.</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>      <em>ALLIUM SATIVUM IS A CINCH</em></strong> to grow, it's      indispensable to a wide range of cuisines, and it's      incredibly good for you. Furthermore, whether planted among      other vegetables and flowers or ground up and used in a      spray, garlic can keep crops healthy by discouraging pests      and diseases. In short, no garden should be without this      versatile herb.</p>			<p>			 Â©AL CLAYTON FOOD STYLING BY MARY ANN CLAYTON			</p>        <p>Though the pungent plant probably originated in what is now the      Kirghiz region of central Asia (on the Soviet-China      border), garlic played a part in a wide variety of cultures      over many centuries. References to the herb have been found      in such ancient sources as 5,000-year-old Sanskrit, as well      as 4,500year-old Babylonian and 3,000-yearold Chinese      writings. The Old Testament, too, tells us that the Hebrews      wandering in the wilderness regretted not having the      onions, leeks, and garlic they had left behind in Egypt.</p><p>As      an illustration of its value to the Egyptians, 15 pounds of      garlic could buy a healthy male slave. A full 1.5 million      pounds (worth more than $2 million today) were consumed by      workers during the 20 years it took to build the great      pyramid at Giza (circa 2500 <em>BC),</em> and pyramid      builders actually w ent on strike when a drought caused      garlic and other food shortages (these were people without      much of a union, too!).</p><p>In the <em>Odyssey,</em> Ulysses      used an herb called moly (Allium moly is a species of wild      garlic) to ward off the black magic of the sorceress Circe,      and ancient Greeks often placed garlic on stones at      crossroads as offerings to Hecate, a goddess of the      underworld. Centuries later, garlic bulbs were thought to      keep vampires at bay and were used to ward off the evil      eye. (If no bulbs were at hand, one could simply shout,      "Garlic in your eyes!")    </p>        <p>      Because it was used so extensively in the medicine, magic,      and cuisine of the lower classes, garlic was often shunned      by the elite. Though six mummified cloves were discovered      in King Tut's tomb, garlic was forbid den to Egyptian      priests, and Rome's senate forbade the use of garlic by      those visiting the Temple of Cybele. Garlic is still taboo      for many Buddhist priests and Hindu Brahmans, who believe      this "hot" food distracts minds and souls from a spiritual      path. An Islamic story of creation holds that garlic grew      in the Garden of Eden wherever the Devil stepped with his      left foot, and onions sprang up where he placed his right.</p><p>      Even so, ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Babylonians, and      Greeks (as well as herbalists of later centuries, including      Native Americans) used garlic to fight-among other      things-intestinal disorders, respiratory infections,      scurvy, ulcers, insect and animal bites, blisters, and      aging. Phoenicians and Vikings carried it on their long sea      voyages. Romans (along with medieval peasants) considered      the pungent bulb to be an aphrodisiac, and they also fed      garlic to both their soldiers and gladiators to provide      courage and strength.</p><p>One interesting, if grisly, garlic      tale concerns some thieves who, as the Black Plague swept      through Marseilles in 1721, consumed copious amounts of      garlic mixed with wine and were able to rob plague victims      without contracting the disease. It's known that garlic      sprays were used in attempts to disinfect the burying      grounds of plague victims.</p><p> During World War I, medical      personnel soaked sterile bandages in diluted garlic juice      to combat wound infections. Around the same time, garlic      inhalants and compresses were somewhat successful in      treating tuberculosis. The curative element is allicin, a      garlic compound isolated in 1944, which gives the herb its      odor as well as its antimicrobial and, some claim,      antiviral properties. According to Russian scientists,      allicin differs from most antibiotics in that it kills      harmful bacteria without affecting beneficial ones, and      it's used in the USSR to fight flu epidemics. More      recently, the British medical journal <em>Lancet</em>      reported that garlic juice apparently reduced serum      cholesterol in volunteers eating high-cholesterol diets.      The Japanese recently discovered that the regular use of      garlic hastens the absorption of Vitamin B,; they use the      vitamin to relieve nervous inflammations, nausea resulting      from pregnancy, and mental depression. They also spray      patients with a solution of garlic and water for problems      as wide-</p><p><strong><em>The strongly scented bulbs are      rich in vitamins B and C as well as in phosphorus, calcium, and potassium,ranging as heart      disease and frostbite.</em></strong></p><p>Researchers are      currently looking into the possibility that daily garlic      consumption may help reduce high blood pressure and that it      may help cleanse the intestines of toxic substances-even      attracting and then expelling from the body such harmful      pollutants as heavy metals and carcinogenic additives.</p><p> In      addition to their purely medicinal properties, the strongly      scented bulbs are rich in vitamins B and C as well as in      phosphorus, calcium, and potassium (and one clove contains      only seven calories). Many people consume garlic to ward of      common colds and traveler's dysentery. Some also feed it to      their pets to control flea and worm infestations. And for      centuries it has been known that garlic mixed with fresh      meat can double or quadruple its shelf life.</p><p>Certainly, as      an organic pest repellent, garlic is nearly unbeatable. It      deters insects (particularly aphids) on such crops as      beets, carrots, parsnips, strawberries, and tomatoes. It      also acts as a protective shield when planted around fruit      trees. It can even discourage Japanese beetles from      attacking rosebushes. Garlic sprays, however, are a more      effective repellent than the plants alone, and they also      deter such diseases as downy mildew and early tomato      blight. (Just grind some cloves in a blender with a small      amount of water, strain this mushy liquid through      cheesecloth, dilute it with about one quart of water, add a      bit of biodegradable detergent to help the juice adhere to      the plants, and put it into a hand sprayer.) You will,      however, have to spray daily for heavy pest      infestations.</p><h3>What to Grow</h3><p>As an allium, garlic is      closely related to onions and other members of the lily      family. But instead of producing one underground bulb, this      perennial produces a cluster of 10 or more small bulbs      called cloves. Each one of these cloves, when set out in      the garden, will produce an eight- to 24-inch-tall stalk      with a lavender flower head and an underground cluster of      cloves. A new plant grows from one of these cloves, and you      can start your own using garlic right from a grocery      store's produce section.</p><p>Garden suppliers may give you a      choice between early-maturing (90 days) white or Mexican      varieties and late-maturing (110 days) pink or Italian      cultivars. The white types produce higher yields than the      pinks but don't store as well.</p><p>Elephant garlic (also known      as jumbo garlic) is actually a type of leek, A.      scorodoprasum, or sometimes A. ampeloprasum. It produces      huge, mild-tasting, easy-to-peel bulbs in around 100 days.      These less pungent bulbs can be eaten much more freely than      true garlicand can even be diced raw for use in salads.      They can be cooked whole with other vegetables or, perhaps,      with a roast and are also delicious when simply steamed and      served alone in a cream sauce as a side dish.</p><p>Hardy and      productive rocambole (Allium sativum var.      <em>ophioscorodon)--also called</em> serpent garlic, or      sand leek-has been described as looking like a cross      between a garlic and an Egyptian onion tied in a love knot.      A close kin to wild garlic, its underground bulbs are      sometimes smaller than regular garlic, and its      unusual-looking flower stalk coils, then straightens, and      later produces a cluster of bulblets at the top of the      stalk. Rocambole's advantage is that you can plant the      bulblets (they take two seasons to form mature cloves) and      keep all the cloves for eating. Somehow rocambole can      handle the job of producing bulblets at the same time that      it forms goodsized cloves, something regular garlic can't      do. (In fact, if your garlic does produce bulblets, you      should snap them off.)</p><h3>How to Grow</h3><p>A good soil-preferably a sandy      loam with plenty of organic matter-is more important for      garlic than for onions. At the very least, the planting      site should be fertile and well drained with a pH of 5.5 to      6.8. It must also be sunny. Garlic needs cool temperatures      during its early stages of growth and is not harmed by      frost or light freezing. Later, however, warm weather and      plenty of sun are required for good bulb development.</p><p>After      tilling and raking the soil, plant the cloves directly in      the garden four to six weeks before the last frost date.      Sow them one to two inches deep with the pointed end up,      spacing them four to six inches apart (10 inches for      elephant garlic, which must be planted in the fall) to      insure big bulbs. (A half pound of cloves will plant a      100-foot row.) Short-season gardeners may want to start the      bulbs indoors about six weeks before it's time to set the      seedlings out. You'll get bigger bulbs by planting two to      four weeks before the first autumn frosts, but in areas      with severe winters such fall plantings will have to be      mulched heavily. However, when mulched, fall-planted garlic      does well even in Canada.</p><p>Once planted, the crop requires      very little care except for weeding, which should be done      by hand to prevent damage to the roots. Again, a mulch will      reduce weed growth and will help conserve the moisture that      is essential in the early stages of growth. Water if dry      conditions prevail, and-except for rocambole--remove flower      heads to produce larger bulbs.</p><h3>What to Watch For</h3><p>      As you've probably surmised, garlic has few pest or disease      problems. The only exceptions might be onion thrips or root      maggots. Thrips puncture plant cells in order to feed,      marking the stems with small, whitish blotches that run      together to form silvery areas. Eventually, the tissue will      wither and collapse. Root maggots hatch from eggs laid at      the roots of plants and then feed on the stems. The best      control method for both these insects is to rotate your      allium crops so they are not grown in the same place more      than once every four to six years. Spacing garlic      throughout the garden will also keep any invading pests      from traveling from plant to plant. Adding sand or wood      ashes to the top layer of the planting rows is another      preventive measure. If thrips are common in your area,      eliminate their winter homes by destroying weeds around the      garden in the fall.</p><p>The only disease that occasionally      attacks garlic is downy mildew, which can be seen best in      the morning while dew is still on the leaves. Its first      symptoms take the form of yellow or grayish, sunken,      watersoaked spots, and it too can be prevented by crop      rotation.</p><h3>How to Harvest and Store</h3><p> Once the leaves      begin to yellow, discontinue watering. When the tops begin      to droop, knock down the aboveground growth to hasten      curing. A few days later, loosen the soil, and either pull      out the entire plant or lift it gently with a spading fork.      (The younger the bulb, the milder it will be.) Spread the      garlic in a cool, dry, shady location (humidity higher than      70% can cause the bulbs to mold), then cut off the tops and      store the bulbs in mesh bags or on trays. You can also      leave the tops on and, when dry, braid them to form      attractive garlic ropes. Cured bulbs will last for six to      12 months if hung in a dry place.</p><p><strong><em>Asians are      fond of pickling garlic in honey,soy sauce, or vinegar, and the resulting pickles are      surprisingly mild-tasting.</em></strong></p><p>Asians are fond of      pickling garlic in honey, soy sauce, or vinegar, and the      resulting pickles are surprisingly mild-tasting. In France,      a famous garlic mayonnaise, aioli (called <em>alt=</em> oli      in Spain), is made with olive oil, egg yolks, lemon juice      or vinegar, and, in some regions, bread crumbs. The Greeks      have a similar sauce called <em>skordalia</em> made with      bread crumbs, garlic, egg yolks, lemon juice, oil, and      mashed potatoes or almonds or walnuts. Such sauces can be      eaten with almost any meat, fish, vegetable, or bread.</p><p> The      following recipes are taken from <em>The Garlic Lovers'      Cookbook</em> ($9.45 paperback, $12.45 spiral-bound,      postpaid), published by The Gilroy Garlic Festival      Association, Inc. (P.O. Box 2311, Gilroy, CA 95020), which      holds a huge garlic fair each August in Gilroy, "the garlic      capital of the world."</p><h3>The Christophers' Garlic      Soup</h3><p> This Mexico-inspired soup by Gilroy garlic      grower and shipper Don Christopher is also delicious .when      reheated.</p><p>6 beef-flavored bouillon cubes<br /> 8 cups boiling      water 14 large cloves garlic<br /> 2 tablespoons butter<br /> 2      tablespoons minced parsley <br />tablespoon flour <br />1/4 teaspoon      freshly ground pepper 6 raw egg yolks, beaten<br /> 6 thin slices      Monterey Jack cheese<br />6 small slices French bread, toasted </p><p>      In a large bowl or saucepan, combine bouillon cubes and      water, stirring until cubes are dissolved. Peel garlic, and      mince (can be done quickly in a blender or food processor).      In a heavy saucepan, over low heat, brown garlic lightly in      butter with minced parsley, stirring constantly so as not      to burn. Add flour, and stir until slightly browned. Add      broth and pepper; simmer at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.      Just before serving, slowly add egg yolks, stirring      constantly. Place cheese on toasted bread, and place 1      slice in each of 6 heatproof serving bowls. Ladle soup into      bowls, and place bowls under broiler just long enough to      melt cheese. (This could also be done in microwave oven.)      Serve at once. Makes 6 generous servings.</p><h3>Tomatoes ala Clare</h3><p>      "Delicious and pretty," says Clara M. Lutz of Redondo      Beach, California, and we have to agree.<br /> 6 medium to large      tomatoes, sliced 3 cloves fresh garlic, minced<br /> 1 bunch      green onions, chopped fine (include some green tops)<br /> 1/2      cup finely chopped parsley<br /> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br /> Coarse black      pepper to taste<br />1/3 cup corn oil<br />1/4 cup brown cider      vinegar<br />1tablespoon Dijon mustard </p><p>      Arrange tomatoes on a shallow dish or platter. Mix garlic,      onions, parsley, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle over tomatoes.      Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3-4 hours.      Prepare dressing by combining oil, vinegar, and mustard. At      serving time, shake well and pour over tomatoes. Serves 6.</p><h3>Rosie's Broccoli Salad</h3><p> Carla Johnson of      Petaluma, California, came up with this tart and tangy      dish.</p><p>2 bunches broccoli <br />1/4 a cup olive oil<br />3-4 cloves      fresh garlic, pressed or minced '/z teaspoon salt<br /> 1/4      teaspoon oregano<br /> 1/4 cup wine vinegar<br /> Cut off tough ends of      broccoli, and discard. Slice remaining stems and flowers      into bitesized pieces. Steam or boil until just tender.      Drain and cool. Toss with olive oil, garlic, salt, and      oregano. Add vinegar, and toss again. Refrigerate at least      1 hour to marinate before serving. This can be prepared the      day prior to serving and can be served chilled or at room      temperature. Serves 10.</p><h3>Karen's Fresh Pears With Garlic Roquefort Dressing</h3><p>Gilroy's Karen      Christopher's classic combination makes a terrific      salad/dessert.</p><p> 1/2 cup mayonnaise <br />1 tablespoon cream 1      tablespoon lemon juice <br />2 cloves fresh garlic, pressed<br />1-1/2      ounces Roquefort or blue cheese,<br /> crumbled 8 fresh Cornice      pears Lemon juice 8 lettuce leaves</p><p>      Mix together mayonnaise, cream, 1 tablespoon lemon juice,      garlic, and cheese, and chill at least 2 hours. Cut pears      in half, and remove seeds and skins. Sprinkle pears with      additional lemon juice to prevent browning. Place on      lettuce leaves for individual servings, and top with      dressing. Serves 8. (This dressing is also delicious on      most greens or can be used as a dip for fresh raw      vegetables.)</p><h3>SUSAN SAYS</h3><p><strong>      MOTHER'S GARDENER, SUSAN SIDES,</strong> heartily endorses the      pungent herb:</p><p> A year without garlic? Never! My plot      increases each season, and still gift-giving, replanting,      and a houseful of hungry fans take their toll. With over      300 different kinds throughout the world (many of which are      available from lesser-known seed companies and from The      Seed Savers Exchange), who could become bored? Here in our      North Carolina test gardens, the ceremonial sowing comes      two to four weeks before the first frost in fall. This      increases our harvest by an average of 50070 and gives us      one last thing to poke into the ground.</p><p>Once the green      shoots are a few inches tall, we mulch to keep the cloves      from heaving in winter and to suppress weeds. Over the      years a one to two inch layer of small or shredded leaves      topped by a very light layer of clean straw has proved      best. As a bonus it conserves moisture, which is just what      these thirsty alliums require all season long.</p><p>That is,      they do until midsummer to late summer when the leaves just      begin to yellow -the signal to stop watering and let those      papery protective skins develop. I don't know about you,      but for this reason we've not had much success tucking      garlic (or onions and shallots, for that matter) in among      other vegetables. Instead, we give these three their own      bed so that their drying-of time doesn't conflict with the      water needs of everything else.    </p>
