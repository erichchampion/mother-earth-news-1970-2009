                		<p>      <em>What all those cans, jars, boxes and bottles tell      you-and what they don't.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Nikki and David Goldbeck    </h5>            <p>      WHEN YOU'RE KNOWN AS "THE Ralph Naders of the food      industry," people can get edgy about inviting you to      dinner. Not long ago, a favorite aunt had us over and      proudly especially for us. As it turned out, the loaf was      made from chemically bleached flour colored to look like a      dark whole grain, and included hydrogenated oil and      artificial preservatives.    </p>    <p>      However, her mistake is quite understandable. In an age      when dishwashing soap boasts real lemon juice and Jell-O      contains artificial lemon flavor, it's no wonder that words      like <em>fresh, light</em> and <em>natural</em> don't men      what our mothers always taught us.    </p>    <p>      Yet, a mass of information appears on the packages you buy,      some of it federally mandated, some voluntarily supplied.      One comic noted that food labels are getting so long he saw      one that said, "Continued on next package." Learning how to      translate that verbiage can help ensure that you're buying      what you really want.    </p>        <p>      <strong>A Label You Can Rely On</strong>    </p>    <p>      Unprocessed whole foods-apples, for      example-don't need labeling. But when foods are      fabricated, the government demands that the makers tell us      what they've done. (Foods sold across state lines adhere to      federal regulations; products manufactured and sold within      one state are subject only to state laws.) Specifically,      the following information must appear-in English,      even if the product is imported-on the <em>principal      display panel</em> (the part of the label most likely to be      displayed) or on the <em>information panel</em> directly to      its right:    </p>    <p>      1. The name of the product.<br />      2. The variety, style and packing medium in conjunction      with the name-for example, "sliced peaches in heavy      syrup." (If you're cutting back on sugar, you now know to      move on.)<br />      3. If a food resembles another but is not nutritionally      equivalent (as defined by the FDA), the word      <em>imitation</em> followed by the name of the food being      simulated. If the food is nutritionally comparable,      however, a fanciful name may be used-for example,      Salad Mate for a line of cellulose-based, vitamin-and      mineral-fortified, extruded "leafy greens."<br />      4. For some foods, the percentage of a characterizing      ingredient, or the announcement that a specific ingredient      is or isn't 'there, or the need to add ingredients.<br />      For example, if "Juicy Fruit Drink" in fact contains no      juice and no fruit, its label has to say so. If you are      expected to add meat to a boxed beef-stew mix, the      manufacturer must point that out.<br />      5. The total amount, liquid included, in the container,      expressed by weight, measure, numerical count or some      combination of these. (Looked closely at those "one-pound"      cans of coffee lately? Most now hold 13 ounces- for      the same price.)<br />      6. A list of ingredients (see below).<br />      7. The name and address of the manufacturer. If the street      address is listed in the phone directory, only the city,      state and zip code are required. This doesn't always make      communication easy. (Points to companies who voluntarily      list their complete addresses, double points for phone      numbers, triple points for an 800 number.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ingredients Labeling</strong>    </p>    <p>      To many health-conscious consumers, the list of ingredients      is the most important part of the label. And in fact,      ingredient labeling, which is federally mandated, is better      today than it's ever been.    </p>    <p>      One of the most useful rules is that <em>ingredients must      appear in descending order of predominance by weight</em>      -that is, what there is most of comes first, what      there is least of comes last. If your breakfast muffin      lists sugar as its first ingredient, then your morning meal      contains more sugar than anything else. If sugar is listed      fourth, there's proportionately less of it. Scanning the      order of ingredients is one of the best ways to comparison      shop. (Who'd have thought that the primary ingredient in      Lemon and Pepper Seasoning would turn out to be-are      you ready-salt?)    </p>    <p>      Still, there are some lamentable exceptions to the      what-you-see-is-what-you-get rule. Added fat. When fat is a      predominant ingredient, the specific type must be listed.      But when it is less than 10% of the product, the      manufacturer can list several fats that the package may (or      may not) contain. For example, the label may state "oil      (contains one or more of the following: soybean, partially      hydrogenated corn, palm or coconut)." This leaves the      consumer in the dark about whether the oil is highly      saturated (palm, coconut), technologically modified      (hydrogenated) or polyunsaturated (soy, etc.).    </p>    <p>      Manufacturers argue that, since the oil they select varies      with availability and market price, printing separate      labels would be too expensive. But considering the current      emphasis on reducing saturated fat in the American diet,      the defense seems inadequate. (We suggest that all the      choices be printed on the label and then punched like a      train ticket to indicate which type a particular batch      actually contains.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Flavorings.</strong> By a fairly complex formula,      the manufacturer must reveal the general source of the      product's flavor. If the flavor is imparted by a food, no      qualifiers are needed ("Blueberry Muffins"). If the flavor      is usually imparted by a food, but the manufacturer has      chosen to use a natural flavoring instead-for      example, a distillate or extract of blueberries-the      word <em>flavored</em> must be inserted in the name      ("Blueberry Flavored Muffins"). The word <em>natural</em>      may be included if the manufacturer desires. If any      artificial flavor is used, the name must be accompanied by      the word <em>artificial</em> or <em>artificially      flavored</em> ("Artificially Flavored Blue-berry Muffins").    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, the list of ingredients need only      mention "spices" or "flavorings" in general terms; what      they are doesn't have to be specified. For people sensitive      to specific seasonings, shopping can be extremely      frustrating.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Colorings.</strong> The label must state when      coloring is added, but only FD & C Yellow #5 must be      mentioned specifically, because of a high incidence of      allergic reactions. Other colorings don't have to be      specified (even though studies suggest their safety varies      widely).    </p>    <p>      Thanks to a powerful lobby, dairy products are exempt from      the regulation about colorings. Processors may add natural      or artificial coloring to cheese, ice cream and butter      without troubling the consumer with that information.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Incidental additives.</strong> "Ingredients within      ingredients" don't always have to be listed. For example, a      product that uses a sweetened fruit as one of its      ingredients may not list sugar on its label. Other      incidentals include fumigants applied during storage,      defoaming and clarifying agents used in production,      fluoride and chlorine in water, and much more. The theory      is that these additives need not be listed because they're      present in "insignificant" amounts or aren't "functional."      But many consumerists suspect that processors are sneaking      additives in through this loophole.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Nutrition Labeling</strong>    </p>    <p>      Nutrition labeling is mandatory when a processor makes a      nutritional or dietary claim on the label or in      advertising, when a food is fortified with a nutrient, or      when the food is intended for children under four (baby and      junior foods). Otherwise, nutrition information is      voluntary.    </p>    <p>      When a product is meant to be further prepared at home (for      example, a cake mix) or eaten in conjunction with another      food (ready-to-eat cereal), a second set of figures can be      presented to show the nutrient content after preparation.    </p>    <p>      For people interested in monitoring certain      nutrients-fat, protein, sodium, etc.- nutrition      labeling is invaluable. However, the system can be      misleading. The fact that only certain select nutrients are      included often gives the illusion that a processed product      is comparable (or even superior) to the real thing. The law      ignores the fact that a whole food may contain trace      minerals, fiber and as yet unknown components that don't      appear on a nutrition label. In fact, the current format      gives fabricated foods a competitive edge if they're highly      fortified or . enriched.    </p>    <p>      (A <em>fortified</em> food has been pumped full of      nutrients it doesn't possess in its natural state; adding      calcium to orange juice makes it a fortified drink.      <em>Enriched</em> foods have nutrients added to replace      losses during processing. For example, white flour may be      enriched with three B vitamins and iron to help compensate      for the 22 nutrients lost when the bran and germ are milled      off.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Learning the Language</strong>    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the trickiest pan of reading a food label is      deciphering the words it contains. Some have specific      definitions established by the FDA, but others derive their      meaning solely from the creative imaginations of      advertising copywriters. In several areas that consumers      care about, there is a mishmash of meaningful and      meaningless terminology. It pays to know the difference.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Calories.</strong> A number of terms provide      specific information for the calorie-conscious.    </p>    <p>      Foods labeled <em>low-calorie</em> contain no more than 40      calories per serving. <em>A reduced-calorie</em> product      must be at least one-third lower in calories than a similar      food in which the calories have not been reduced, and it      must not be nutritionally inferior to the unmodified      version. If the term <em>diet</em> appears with no further      explanation, it must meet one of the two previous criteria.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sugar.</strong> If a food is <em>sugar-free</em> ,      then it contains no added nutritive sweetener-no      sucrose (table sugar), malt sugar, fructose, corn syrup,      honey, molasses, maple syrup or concentrated fruit      sweetener. (If a food labeled sugar-free is neither low-      nor reduced-calorie, it's supposed to make that clear,      perhaps with "intended to reduce tooth decay" or "not a      reduced-calorie food.")    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, <em>no sugar added</em> is not a      federally regulated phrase and usually refers to sucrose      alone; you may be getting ample amounts of sugar in its      other forms. For example, one barbecue sauce that promises      "No sugar!" lists corn syrup as its second ingredient.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Salt.</strong> Any reference to salt or sodium on      the label mandates quantitative sodium labeling. In      addition, some terms are federally defined. A      <em>low-sodium</em> product has 140 milligrams or less per      serving; <em>very low-sodium</em> , 35 mg or less;      <em>sodium-</em> or <em>salt-free</em> , less than five.      For a product to claim <em>reduced sodium</em> , it must      contain 75% less than its regular version or than a      competitor's.    </p>    <p>      Watch out for <em>unsalted</em> and <em>no salt added</em>      ; they don't necessarily mean sodium-free. Why? Because      these terms don't encompass other sodium-based compounds      that may have been added-for example, monosodium      glutamate (MSG), sodium benzoate and sodium propionate.      (Watch for the word <em>sodium</em> .)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cholesterol and fat.</strong> We've all seen "No      cholesterol!" emblazoned across bottles of cooking oil, as      if this one manufacturer had finally succeeded in removing      it; technology marches on. While the claim is true, it's      not exactly news. No vegetable product contains      cholesterol, which is manufactured in the bodies of animals      (including ours).    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, what the "no cholesterol" claims don't point      out is that saturated fat is even more likely to raise your      blood cholesterol level than eating cholesterol itself. So      a product that promises no cholesterol but is full of      saturated fat is no nutritional bargain.    </p>    <p>      "All-vegetable shortening!" Good, you think. No      cholesterol, no saturated fat. Right the first time, maybe      not the second. Vegetable oils such as coconut and palm      kernel are highly saturated. And even if the manufacturer      started out with an unsaturated oil, if he "hydrogenated"      it-added hydrogen atoms so it would remain solid at      room temperature-then he turned it into a saturated      fat.    </p>    <p>      So much for language that's at least partially meaningful.      In the advertisers' lexicon there are other terms that have      no reliable meaning whatsoever. They suggest, entice and      sometimes mislead.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Light.</strong> Sara Lee, the dieter's nemesis, has      come out with Light Classics French Cheesecake. Before you      dig in, the bad news is that it has more calories than the      original version.    </p>        <p>      How can this happen? The words <em>light</em> and      <em>lite</em> are unregulated in all but meat and poultry      products, food companies can use them any way they want to.      Some "light" products are reduced in calories-which      is what we all expect-but they're just as likely to      be lighter in color (as in "light" oil) or taste, or lower      in other ingredients (salt, sugar, breading, alcohol). By      "light" cheesecake, Sara Lee was referring to texture.      Natural. Since the term has no official definition, almost      anything goes. At one time it was an indication of quality;      now it's a warning flag.<br />      "Natural" cheeses can contain artificial coloring and      preservatives; "natural" ice creams are not only loaded      with sugar but often include vegetable gums and mono- and      diglycerides; "natural" breads may be made of refined white      flour and fortified with synthetic nutrients; some      "natural" cereals are more highly sweetened than processed      ones; foods that are "naturally flavored" may also contain      artificial flavoring, preservatives, thickeners and      colorants. Even margarine, a totally fabricated product,      has been labeled "natural" by some manufacturers.    </p>    <p>      In fairness to the consumer, "natural" should be limited to      a product that could be duplicated in a typical      well-equipped home kitchen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Organic.</strong> The federal government places no      restrictions on this term when applied to produce. So      consumers who buy food labeled "organic" in the belief that      it has been raised without pesticides, synthetic      fertilizers or other related chemicals may or may not be      getting what they paid for. (Thirteen states do have legal      definitions of the term; see the accompanying map.)    </p>    <p>      The USDA does not permit the word on meat or poultry      labels. If the animals were raised on feed and water free      of pesticides and chemical contaminants and were treated      with drugs only for illness, the meat may be labeled      "naturally grown." But the USDA also allows "natural" to      describe meat and poultry products that contain no      artificial flavoring, coloring and preservatives and are      only minimally processed. Many consumers mistakenly      interpret this to mean no hormones, antibiotics or feed      additives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fresh.</strong> You may begin to wonder about the      term when it's applied to canned clam chowder,      vacuum-packed salad with a two-month shelf life and      aseptically boxed milk. The USDA ruled recently that      "fresh" can apply to refrigerated processed foods that      contain previously cured, canned or frozen components, and      can even be used in the names of cured, canned or frozen      products- "as long as it remains clear to the      purchaser that the product is not fresh."    </p>    <p>      <strong>The y words.</strong> Watch out for foods that are      "fruity," "chocolaty," "buttery" or anything else ending      my. According to the dictionary, the suffix means      "something like." A "fruity" drink need contain no fruit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Flavor.</strong> When the word follows a specific      source, it means the flavor, not the source, was added.      "Cherry flavor" tells you that the product has the flavor      of cherries (synthetic or real), not cherries in the flesh.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tastes like.</strong> When Brand X "tastes like"      real peanut butter, don't assume it has any.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Creme.</strong> The real stuff is spelled "cream."      Creme is usually made from corn syrup, gelatin,      hydrogenated shortening, milk derivatives, mono- and      diglycerides, artificial flavoring and more. And don't get      your hopes up; it's no lower in fat.    </p>    <p>      At our house, we maintain a museum of champion food labels.      Our favorite is Rod-denbery's Butter-Maple Syrup. Guess      what, folks? No butter. No maple syrup.    </p>    <p>      <em>Nikki and David Goldbeck are the authors of six books      on food, most recently</em> The Goldbecks' Guide to Good      Food <em>(New American Library, 1987).
