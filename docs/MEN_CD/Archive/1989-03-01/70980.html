                <p><strong>TO YOUR HEALTH</strong></p>        <p>      These "defeated' ills have lost a battle but not yet the      war.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      A new additive is said to prevent cholesterol's absorption      by the body.    </p>        <p>      <em>When it concerns the fitness of body, mind or spirit,      the editors of American Health are there, staying on top of      up-to-date medical research, separating fad from fact and      helping you preserve and improve life's most precious      gift-your good health. A major story in a recent      issue involves diseases once thought defeated in this      country that are rearing their ugly heads again.</em>    </p>    <h3>Comeback Diseases</h3>    <p>      Infectious diseases such as cholera, rheumatic fever and      plague-though quite rare-are still threats to      be reckoned with. For example, cholera, <em>Vibrio      comma</em> , is turning up in the shellfish population,      mainly on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It's usually transmitted to      humans when they eat shellfish that have been undercooked      or improperly stored. Likewise, outbreaks of such maladies      of yesteryear as measles, mumps, diphtheria, tuberculosis      and syphilis are on the rise. That's partly because      parents, doctors and public health authorities have failed      to mount the effort needed to make sure everyone      susceptible to preventable diseases, regardless of economic      status, is vaccinated. In fact, immunization levels for      preschoolers actually worsened or showed no improvement      between 1980 and 1985 (the latest years for which data are      available).    </p>    <p>      Even people who have been properly immunized are being      stricken. In the majority of recent cases of measles, the      administered vaccine apparently never took hold. However, a      rise in cases of whooping cough may not be the result of a      failure of a vaccine but, perhaps, failure of the immunity      to last as people grow older. This might not matter as much      if more infants were immunized and there wasn't so much      whooping cough around to pose a risk. Diphtheria, too, is      striking people who've been immunized but whose immunity      levels have fallen. Indeed, tomorrow's adults may find      themselves as vulnerable as yesterday's children to this      illness.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes a bygone infectious disease strikes again because      it suddenly becomes more virulent, as is probably the case      with the Group A streptococcus strains that can lead to      rheumatic fever. What's more, organisms that "learn"      certain adaptations (such as the ability to adhere more      tightly to a human cell or to resist an antibiotic) can      sometimes pass the traits to cousins through mobile pieces      of DNA, called transposons. For example, <em>Staphylococcus      aureus</em> , which causes toxic shock syndrome, appears to      have passed on its toxin-producing know-how to      streptococci. The result: "toxic strep syndrome."    </p>    <p>      Scientists are also speculating that the global warming      trend (a 50-year forecast predicts that temperatures may      rise by up to 9Â°F) may encourage a dramatic increase in      mosquito breeding, with far-ranging infectious      consequences, such as hemorrhagic dengue fever, which      strikes children. Symptoms usually range from fever and      headache to shock, prostration and internal bleeding.      Already, <em>Aedes albopictus</em> , the mosquito that      carries the dengue virus, has spread to many regions of the      U.S., including cities in Texas, Florida, Louisiana,      Missouri, Indiana and Tennessee.    </p>    <p>      Many other exotic infections-leprosy (caused by a      relative of the tuberculosis organism), glanders (caused by      a bacterium <em>Pseudomonas mallei</em> ) and      schistosomiasis (a parasitic illness)-have been      imported (and sometimes spread) by travelers and refugees.      There also has been a steady resurgence of bubonic plague      in the U.S., which has been linked to the increasing      numbers of people pursuing recreational activities in the      Southwest, where plague-carrying fleas infest rock      squirrels, other rodents and even cats and dogs.    </p>    <p>      But we are not helpless against comeback diseases. Here are      eight things you can do to combat them:    </p>    <p>      1. Ask your doctor whether your immunizations are      up-to-date. Check especially for measles, mumps, tetanus,      diphtheria, rubella, polio and hepatitis B. (If you're      exposed to a person with such an infection and don't know      whether you're adequately immunized, consult a physician.)    </p>    <p>      2. Make sure your children are immunized on schedule,      especially before they're placed in a day-care center or      reach school age. (If your child isn't fully immunized and      contacts someone with measles, whooping cough or chicken      pox, consult your pediatrician immediately.)    </p>    <p>      3. Before you travel abroad, discuss your itinerary with      your physician, and make sure you receive the proper      immunizations,<br />      immune globulin and preventive medications as indicated.      (When traveling to tick-infested areas, protect yourself      and your pets by using tick repellents and by making      frequent inspections.)    </p>    <p>      4. Never handle an animal not well known to you. Always      seek medical attention if bitten.    </p>    <p>      5. Always take a child's sore throat seriously; consult      your doctor about the possibility of strep.    </p>    <p>      6. Cook shellfish thoroughly. Before eating raw clams and      oysters, especially in the Gulf Coast region, inquire about      recent cases of cholera.    </p>    <p>      7. Care conscientiously for hot tubs, humidifiers, contact      lenses and all those other wonderful technological      conveniences. When not kept clean, they're boons to      microorganisms, too.    </p>    <p>      8. Keep abreast of community health issues. Tell your      elected representatives if you feel there are inadequate      public health services in your area.    </p>    <h3>The Laughter Defense</h3>    <p>      When laughter bursts forth, your metabolism picks up,      muscles are massaged, and neurochemicals stream into the      blood. You feel relaxed-and you raise your guard      against depression, heart disease and pain.<br />      <br />      Now researchers think laughter may empower the immune      system as well. New studies indicated that laughter can      increase concentrations of salivary immunoglobulin A      (IgA)-an antibody linked to lower rates of upper      respiratory illnesses. In fact, it's been found that IgA      levels are naturally high in people who regularly battle      adversity with humor. In addition, laughter decreases      cortisol, an immune suppressor, which has a tremendous      influence on the immune system. This decrease allows      interleukin-2 and other immune boosters to express      themselves.    </p>    <h3>Overseas Mail-Order Drugs</h3>    <p>      In a surprise move that has prompted both cheers and jeers,      the Food and Drug Administration has decided that Americans      may now mail-order foreign pharmaceuticals for personal use      even though the drugs are not approved in the U.S. This      means that AIDS patients can now get promising AIDS drugs,      such as Japan's dextran sulfate, from overseas, and that      mail-ordering of drugs for nearly everything from cancer to      arthritis is permitted. The only banned drugs are some 40      already proscribed by the FDA as fraudulent or dangerous.      Otherwise, almost anything goes-as long as drug      shipments are for personal use and are limited to a      three-month supply or less. In addition (the real trick),      you must specify that a licensed U.S. doctor will oversee      treatment. However, these new guidelines are "on a pilot      basis subject to change or cancellation."    </p>    <p>      Right now, the FDA is downplaying the news for anyone other      than AIDS patients and the desperately ill. The truth is      that all Americans now have a world of pharmaceuticals from      which to choose, albeit at their own risk. People with      intractable illnesses might consult <em>Orphan Drugs</em>      (The Body Press, $ 14.9 5) by Kenneth and Lois Ander-son, a      book that describes 192 generic and 1,545 brand-name drugs      available in other countries, gives the foreign trademarks      and addresses of distributors, and tells how to find a      doctor overseas if a prescription is needed.    </p>    <p>      It should be kept in mind, however, that even when the FDA      does approve a drug in the U.S., it may not be as safe as      you think. In 1986 (the latest year for which data are      available) there were more than 10,500 reports of new drugs      having unexpected side effects, ranging from untoward drug      interactions and nervous system or digestive problems to      fatal reactions. A whopping 24% of reports on new and      established drugs indicated a patient had died or was      hospitalized as a result of the drug.    </p>    <h3>Too Good for Your Own Good</h3>    <p>      Those spiffy ultrasonic humidifiers are too good at what      they do. According to the EPA, if you fill one up with tap      water, the ultra-fine mist may contain hazardous levels of      lead, aluminum, asbestos and dissolved organic gases. Even      some "deionized" water actually contains enough impurities      to cause air-quality problems. (Check nearby surfaces for a      fine white powder-evidence your humidifier is      emitting problem particles.)    </p>    <p>      The solution? Get out the old steam vaporizer. Even used      with tap water, it leaves minerals behind and-unlike      impeller-type (cool-mist) humidifiers-its heat kills      mold or bacteria in the tank.    </p>    <h3>The Smoking Gum</h3>    <p>      Nicotine-in cigarettes and smokeless      tobacco-actually alters the gum cells. In lab      studies, researchers found that nicotine prompts gum cells      to grow abnormally, thus encouraging gum disease.      Nicotine-exposed cells also fail to attach firmly to tooth      roots buried under the gum. That's especially bad news for      smokers going through periodontal surgery. If gum tissue is      slow to attach to the tooth after surgery ,therapy could      fail.    </p>    <h3>Coming Up Short</h3>    <p>      It's no secret that severe malnutrition stunts growth, but      recent evidence suggests that even marginal deficiencies      may also keep some children from reaching optimal heights.    </p>    <p>      In Ontario, when University of Guelph researcher Rosalind      Gibson gave 10 mg of extra zinc daily for a year to eight      boys marginally deficient in zinc, they grew faster than      eight similarly zinc-deficient boys who did not receive the      supplements.    </p>    <p>      Since zinc is essential for cell and bone growth, children      and teens-especially boys-need more during      growth spurts. If they don't get enough, the deficiency can      create a vicious cycle."    </p>    <p>      "One of the first symptoms is impaired appetite," says      Gibson. "So if a child is even moderately deficient in      zinc, his food intake decreases, and he becomes even more      deficient."<br />      In an unrelated study, Cornell researchers have shown that      iron supplementation significantly improves growth in      mildly anemic children.    </p>    <p>      Certainly not all short children are deficient in zinc or      iron, but it's something to be aware of. Fortunately, both      zinc and iron are found in red meat and poultry. Whole      grains, nuts and legumes are also good sources, though zinc      from vegetables is less readily absorbed than that from      animal sources. Iron supplements, on the other hand, can      inhibit the absorption of zinc, so make sure any zinc and      iron supplements are taken in roughly equal amounts.    </p>    <h3>Cholesterol-Proofing Food</h3>    <p>      Our nation's consciousness of the connection between low      cholesterol and a healthy heart has definitely been raised.      Now there may be a natural food additive that would make      cholesterol indigestible. Instead of being absorbed, the      fatty substance would pass right through the body.    </p>    <p>      According to Iowa State nutrition researcher Donald Beitz,      the magic ingredient is cholesterol reductase, an enzyme      that turns cholesterol into coprostanol, an indigestible      fat. However, it's not yet known if the coprostanol would      be completely excreted or if it can, indeed, pass      <em>safely</em> through your system. And, even if it does      work well, the anticholesterol additive would not be a      cure-all.    </p>    <p>      "Saturated fats are four times more likely to raise blood      cholesterol levels than dietary cholesterol itself,"      explains cardiologist John LaRosa of George Washington      University and chairman of the American Heart Association's      nutrition committee.    </p>    <p>      Translation: Watch out for saturated fat from the butter in      the pan-not just the cholesterol in the eggs. The      enzyme won't tame the butter. It's better to eat a      different breakfast altogether. Oatmeal with skim milk and      fresh fruit, for example, eschews fat, and the oatmeal      itself helps lower cholesterol.    </p>
