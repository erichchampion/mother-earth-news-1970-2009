                    <p>      <em>Solutions for the chemically sensitive.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By John Bower    </h5>    <p>      OUR HOUSE WAS DESIGNED TO minimize indoor air pollution.      While such a house is probably a good idea for most people,      it was an absolute necessity for my wife, Lynn, who is      extremely sensitive to the many pollutants that our society      takes for granted. She cannot tolerate such things as      exhaust fumes, household cleaning products, synthetic      fragrances and printing ink. Scientists are in agreement      that these substances are toxic in high doses, but the      growing segment of the population that exhibits symptoms at      low doses was largely unexpected.    </p>    <p>      In fact, a commission at the National Academy of Sciences      recently estimated that about 15% of the U.S. population      may have increased sensitivity to low doses of pollutants.      Symptoms vary tremendously depending on the individual and      the toxin. In Lynn's case, diesel exhaust fumes cause her      speech to become slurred, while gasoline exhaust results in      hyperactivity. Polyethylene sheeting, also a      petroleum-based product, can trigger instant depression.      Other exposures bring on other symptoms.    </p>    <p>      In 1976, Lynn and I bought and remodeled a multistory house      built in 1850. The building had asbestos-cement siding and      lead-based paint-typical pollutants in old houses. We      gutted the interior and brought it up to 20th-century      standards by adding such things as synthetic carpeting and      new cabinets containing particle board. By the time we were      finished remodeling, she was confined to bed. Her system      was overwhelmed, and practically every organ in her body      was affected. Today, though her health is much improved,      she remains sensitive to many things and, as a result, is      severely restricted in what she can do.    </p>    <p>      Getting rid of all the toxic cleaning products under the      kitchen sink was easy. Buying 100% cotton clothing without      any chemical treatments was more involved. Finding a      building site 500 feet away from traffic fumes and      agricultural chemicals took time. But the real difficulty      came in actually building a home she could tolerate.    </p>    <p>      Many building materials release a variety of chemicals into      the air as they age (this is called outgassing), and these      fumes bother many sensitive people. New-car smell is a      result of outgassing of upholstery and plastic.      Formaldehyde is one of the major gases given off by      carpeting, hardwood plywood, particle board and some      insulations. Lynn is even bothered by the natural aroma of      softwood framing lumber. Asphalt fumes from roof shingles      are also a problem, as are most paints.    </p>    <p>      Though many experts blame high levels of indoor pollution      on the trend to seal houses from air leakage, we decided to      build our house as tight as possible. Every house needs      fresh air. Some builders rely on random infiltration, but      we have the advantage of being able to control and filter      our air supply. Our house is well enough sealed that      practically all exchanging air passes through a charcoal      filter fitted to a heat-recovery ventilator capable of      changing indoor air once per hour. Stale air registers are      located in the kitchen, bathroom and all closets, and fresh      air enters through a grille in the central hallway. In this      way, good air circulation is assured, and all rooms are      vented to the outdoors.    </p>    <p>      We usually run the fan on high for six to eight hours per      day, and then shut it off in the evenings. But at times, as      when a neighbor is burning trash, the filter can become      overloaded. Then we simply turn the fan off until the      outdoor air has cleared. Of course, the outdoor supply      shouldn't be shut off for long periods, but we've had no      trouble with it turned off for a couple of days at a time.    </p>    <p>      The frame of the house is made entirely of steel. Steel      studs and joists are common in commercial construction, but      they've never caught on for residential use. They have the      general advantages of being lightweight, non-combustible      and nonwarping. But from our standpoint, they also have no      odor and eliminate the need to treat the house with toxic      termiticides.    </p>    <p>      Aluminum siding and steel roofing further minimize      outgassing. These products typically have baked-on finishes      that are odor-free. Our windows are aluminum-framed. In the      interest of energy efficiency, they are triple glazed, have      thermal breaks in the metal frames, and most of them face      south to take advantage of passive-solar heat. The entry      doors are insulated with potentially problematic foam      insulation, but their steel skins seem to seal very well.    </p>    <p>      We used ceramic tile throughout for the floor of the house.      It is inert (nonreactive) and has proved quite attractive.      I mixed the mortar and grout myself from cement, sand and      water, to avoid the synthetic additives common to most      premixed commercial products. The thinset did contain some      undesirable ingredients, but by the time it was covered      with tile and the joints were grouted, it proved tolerable.      Cotton and wool area rugs are used instead of synthetic      fibers.    </p>    <p>      There are no 100% nontoxic insulations available. In order      to avoid outgassing chemicals, we used foil-backed dry wall      over fiberglass insulation and took extra pains to seal      around doors, windows and electrical boxes. As a result,      the insulation is totally separated from the living space.      All exterior walls were insulated, dry walled and sealed      before interior walls were built, to make sure that the      barrier was complete. We used extruded polystyrene      insulation under the four-inch concrete slab, which      effectively seals the insulation from the indoors.    </p>    <p>      All the water supply lines are copper, but the drains are      PVC plastic, which does out-gas. Similarly, residential      electrical wire has plastic jacketing. These materials are      inside the uninsulated interior walls, and we were unsure      if they would present a problem. So, as a safety measure, I      wrapped all such plastic with aluminum foil to minimize      outgassing.    </p>    <p>      The paper facing on dry wall is made of recycled newspaper,      which presents a problem because of ink residues.      Fortunately, we were able to find a primer that effectively      sealed the dry wall. Most commercial dry-wall joint      compounds contain vinyl, fungicides and      antifreeze-all potential problems. We were able to      use a specially formulated nontoxic compound made in Texas.      The paint we selected was imported from West Germany. It is      made from "all natural" materials, but it outgassed for      three months after the house was complete. Eventually, the      house aired out and became tolerable. Because of the      problematic materials involved in dry walling, unpainted      plaster could be used instead. It is more inert, but it's      also more expensive.    </p>    <p>      Most kitchen cabinets are built with particle board or      hardwood plywood veneered with an attractive wood, such as      oak. These materials outgas formaldehyde. So, I built all      of our cabinets of solid wood. We chose tulip poplar      because of local availability, cost and appearance. The      counter tops are stainless steel, instead of the usual      plastic laminate over particle board. An extra-powerful      exhaust fan vents the electric range, and a sliding pocket      door can be closed to separate the kitchen from the rest of      the house should cooking odors become unusually strong.    </p>    <p>      We placed the washing machine and dryer in a closet in the      bathroom to keep the major moisture sources in one room.      Custom-made porcelainized steel panels around the bathtub      prevent the mold growth that is inevitable in the grout of      ceramic tile. The toilet tank is insulated to minimize      condensation, which could lead to mold growth.    </p>    <p>      Because the insulation values for the walls (R-40) and      ceiling (R-45) are so high and the house is so well sealed,      we have very little need for heat. Only 4,000 watts of      electric-powered hydronic heat is needed to keep us      comfortable.    </p>    <p>      We've lived in this house for nearly two years now, and      Lynn's health is slowly improving. There are still many      things that she is sensitive to, but our house certainly      isn't one of them.    </p>    <p>      <em>John Bower writes and lectures on safe housing and is      the owner of a residential design/construction company      called Ecologically Safe Homes, 7471 North Shiloh Rd.,      Unionville, IN 47468, 812/332-5073.</em>    </p>
