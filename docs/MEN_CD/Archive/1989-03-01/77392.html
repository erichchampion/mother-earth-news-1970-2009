    <p>
                    <p>      MOTHER'S gardeners spent last season putting a number of      fancy new vegetable varieties to the test.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Susan Sides    </h5>            <p>      I LOVE THE RITUAL OF ORDERING seed-it's probably the      most decadent part of my job. First, the citrus crate,      crammed to overflowing with catalogues, is hauled next to      my favorite chair. Then the fire is stoked, a red pen is      found in the desk clutter, and enough food is gathered to      last several hours. As I settle in and conform to the      well-worn contours of the antique wing chair's stuffing,      the normal restrictions of time, space and cost seem as far      away as next year's tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      This past gardening season, though, I had the extra job of      testing the new 1988 varieties (and a few of '89's), so      things weren't quite so simple. I had sent letters to just      over 100 seed companies, asking what they considered to be      their best introductions for the new year. The results were      overwhelming-a bushel basket of samples arrived by      spring. And they kept coming. Indeed, long after every last      inch of the garden had been planted, seeds were still      falling out of my mailbox-many with long personal      letters attached.    </p>    <p>      I couldn't grow them all (who could?). So I tried my best      to chose varieties that sounded like they had that      quintessential difference. Take beans, for instance. It      took more than a description like "Flat green pods, 6 to 7      inches long, good for freezing" to entice me to give up      precious garden space. But Dragon's Langerie, a wax bean      that promised the works-high yields, earliness and      tender, long pods, all wrapped in a colorful      "package"-was irresistible, and thus was included in      my trials.    </p>    <p>      So before you put your feet up and daydream through your      own stack of catalogues, you might like to see how some of      '88's newest performed in my garden-both the pick of      the crop and a few of the "pans." (Most are available from      seed companies other than the ones specifically mentioned      here.)    </p>    <h3>      Tomatoes    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Sweet Million FNTL Hybrid</strong> : This cherry      tomato started the season slowly, but eventually produced      "sweet hundreds" of one-and-a-quarter-inch fruits. Friends      who received the excesses praised the flavor of the little      tomatoes (many said they tasted even better when broiled).      My five-foot-tall bamboo cages could barely contain the      large, indeterminate and quite disease-resistant plants.      (Park)    </p>        <h3>      Early Pearl is an heirloom sweet corn and may be our      favorite.    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Gold Nugget:</strong> I like colorful salads, and      the rich golden hue of these cherry tomatoes stands out      like a spring flower. Gold Nugget was our first tomato of      the season and kept on producing, oblivious to disease. The      flavor is hearty without being overly sweet or tart, and      the plants stay a wonderfully manageable height of under      two and a half feet. (Johnny's)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sweet Corn</strong>    </p>    <p>      Breeder's Choice: This Sugar Extender hybrid (a corn bred      to last a long time before its sugars turn to starch)      produced an excellent first crop that held its sweet flavor      over about a two-week harvest period. Most stalks carried      two small (seven-inch) ears. Kernels are pale      yellow-almost white-and pleasantly sweet      without being candylike. (Burpee) Early Pearl: It took      years of seed-saving efforts by back-yard growers to make      this early, open-pollinated sweet corn once again available      to the public. The harvest season is extensive due to the      staggered maturation of the six-inch ears (usually two per      stalk). Our patch put out some of the most succulently      sweet corn we've ever tasted. (Good Seed)    </p>        <h3>      How about a foot tall cuke plant that yields in abundance?    </h3>    <h3>      Beans    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Dragon's Langerie:</strong> This unusually named      (and spelled) wax bean got my attention-in the      catalogue and in the garden. It came on with a furor and      kept on producing. The large, flat beans had an excellent      mild taste, even when up to eight inches long. They also      had color: The pale yellow beans sported purple stripes at      snap stage, which changed to cranberry at shell stage (the      stripes function as built-in ripening timers and disappear      during blanching). (Vermont Bean Seed)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Finaud filet bean</strong> : Here's what I      like-a vegetable that works hard so I don't have to.      The long, slender pods of traditional filets must be picked      daily to capture their delicate French taste. Finaud beans,      though, hold onto that intense young flavor and tender      texture as they mature, so the plants need picking only one      to three times. You'd be hard pressed to find a bean that      puts out more in a very small space. (Cook's)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mini Green:</strong> These baby beans stay short      and tender-they don't get big and tough like normal      snap beans. Since I break the calyx end off beans as I pick      them, I never had to do any further snapping of Mini Greens      in the kitchen. (Park)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Peppers</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Orobelle golden pepper:</strong> I can't praise      Orobelles enough. Friends, astounded at the baskets full of      sweet-tasting peppers that I gave away from only five      plants, asked over and over for their source. Each of these      hybrid peppers turns from green to a golden yellow and is      blocky, well formed and large. The plants were also very      disease-resistant. (Johnny's)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mini Green and Mini Yellow peppers:</strong> The      pepper versions of cherry tomatoes, Minis require too much      cleaning and cutting to be used for cooking or relish, but      they're just right for salads, hors d'oeuvres and      out-of-hand eating. The hearty plants looked like replicas      of Charlie Brown's Christmas tree, each drooping under an      excess of little orange lights. (Seeds Blum)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chile-Espanola Improved:</strong> Touted as "a      special short-season chile that will turn red even in cool      or northern climates," Espanola Improved was, indeed, the      first of our seven hot pepper varieties to ripen. Ten      neighbors with braver tongues than mine did all my chile      testing and proclaimed this version to be only mildly hot      and excellent for use as stuffed chiles rellenos. Hotness,      though, varies with climate and soil conditions-you      could get very different taste results. (Plants of the      Southwest)    </p>    <h3>      Eggplants    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Listada de Gandia:</strong> Only two of our many      garden visitors recognized this beautiful purple and white      tiger-striped fruit as being an eggplant. Each averages      five inches long, is roundishly plump and looks more like      an exotic table decoration than a practical vegetable. But      practical it is. Plants consistently outgrew four other      eggplant varieties and produced right up until frost. And      the skins are so delicate you can leave them on when      cooking. (Southern Exposure)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Extra Long eggplant:</strong> This Oriental      egg-plant is another that looks like the product of an      artist's imagination. Each fruit was eight inches long, a      mere inch-and-a-half wide and a deep, electric purple. Just      under the calyx, there are several color bands ranging from      light purple to white. The compact plants took longer to      bear than Listada, but eventually put out many fruits with      mild taste and delicate skins. (Sunrise Enterprises)      Chinese Long White: Of all the eggplants in our trials,      this long ornamental was the most severely set back by      pesky flea beetles. Late in the season, though, the plants      rallied to produce plump fruits. (Tsang and Ma)    </p>    <h3>      Kale    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Greenpeace:</strong> It's hard to imagine a more      decorative leaf vegetable than this rare Russian kale from      the Greenpeace Experimental Farm in British Columbia.      Magenta-colored stems, veining and edging accent the      frilly, oak leaf-shaped foliage. (Southern Exposure)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Red Russian:</strong> Here's another beautiful      version of this cold-weather staple. The foliage turns      completely red with the onset of cold weather. (Peace)    </p>    <h3>      Cauliflower    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Ravella Hybrid:</strong> Ravella, the only      cauliflower sent in for our trials, proved to be such a      vigorous and disease-resistant winner in spring that we      used it for our entire fall planting. We harvested nothing      but perfect white heads averaging from six to nine inches      across. (Park)    </p>        <h3>      Chard    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Italian Green and Red Chard Mix:</strong> This      lovely mix was praised so much by our neighbors that even      my chard-hating husband agreed it was worth planting. Sold      as a small-space container crop, the pretty ruby-and-<br />      white-stalked plants practically took care of themselves. I      cut them nearly to the ground in midsummer, after which      they came back to bear heavily again. (Shepherd's)    </p>    <h3>      Beets    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Replata:</strong> Shep Ogden, head of The Cook's      Garden seed company, told us he sowed these beets, one to      each cell of a plug tray, and set the starts out (under a      spunbond row cover) as soon as the soil could be worked.      "No need to thin," he said, "just harvest a bunch from each      spot." We tried his ideas (sans cover) and they worked. On      May 20 we had our first mouth-watering meal of these      tender, sweet little beets. (Cook's)    </p>    <p>      <strong>McGregor's Favorite Beet:</strong> This old      Scottish cultivar (newly imported from Holland) is highly      ornamental. The deep purple leaves make a good spring      substitute for radicchio in salads. Another      surprise-the roots are carrot-shaped. Though not as      sweet as many other beets, McGregor's lasted almost forever      without becoming woody. (Garden City Seeds)	     </p>    <h3>			      Mesclun    </h3>    <p>      <strong>The Mesclun Collection:</strong> Wave upon wave of      salad goodies awaits harvesting when you plant each of the      nine varieties of The Mesclun Collection in a separate row.      Lettuces, arugula, dandelion, chervil and      chicories-the only thing lacking is the dressing.      (Plant the arugula two weeks later than the rest or be      prepared to cut it back a few times.) There was enough seed      to plant two 4' X 20' beds-four rows per bed. That's      only eight varieties? Uh, well-I just couldn't bring      myself to use garden space for the domestic dandelion. (Le      Marché)    </p>    <h3>      Lettuce    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Thai 88:</strong> What does a lettuce from Thailand      look like? Well, this one was an oakleaf type with tightly      wound, light green leaves on eight-inch heads. The plant      stood up fairly well to hot weather, though not as      valiantly as the standbys Oakleaf or Salad Bowl. (Southern      Exposure)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rossa D'Amerique:</strong> Either a cutting or      loose-head lettuce, D'Amerique was an eyecatching success      when interplanted among the spring cabbages. We also used      it as a border plant (each head was 10 inches across) and      in a cutting mix of our own concoction. The soft,      mild-flavored leaves are wavy and puckered, with rosy tips.      (Cook's)    </p>    <p>      <strong>St. Blaise:</strong> What a great little      romaine-type lettuce this turned out to be. The small,      light green heads are very vigorous and have a nice, hearty      (neither sweet nor bitter) taste. St. Blaise stood strong      in both spring and summer weather. (Cook's)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cocarde Oak Leaf:</strong> I love oakleaf lettuces,      so I was naturally excited to grow my first red one. Spring      crops (and one planting started in July under shade cloth)      displayed more than 50% maroon coloring, while the fall      crop turned almost entirely crimson. Plants were six to      eight inches across and very vigorous and had a loose,      upright growing habit. (Le Marché)    </p>    <h3>      Spinach    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Sputnik F1 Hybrid:</strong> This so-called      three-season spinach did produce well throughout the year,      though the spring crop was the best by far. Leaves are      dark, semisavoyed and fairly large. As a rule, the      germination rate for spinach is nothing to be praised, but      Sputnik was a delightful exception. (Cook's)      <strong>Viroflay:</strong> The seed for Viroflay comes      treated-a negative mark in my book. The resulting      plant, however, is definitely a spinach success story. The      smooth, large leaves (up to four by six inches) are a      breeze to wash. The texture when raw isn't as succulent as      a savoy, but it's just as good when cooked. (R.H. Shumway)    </p>    <h3>      Zucchini    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Butterblossoms:</strong> If, like me, you want a      little bit of zucchini but not too much, Butter-blossoms      should fit the menu nicely. For months on end the compact,      bush-type plants put forth a primary crop of large, edible      male blossoms that were perfect for stuffing. Only a few      wayward female blossoms developed into real zucchini.      (Southern Exposure)    </p>    <h3>      Cucumbers    </h3>    <p>      Are you a small-space or container gardener? Here are two      cukes so compact that each could just about be grown in an      old shoe. We harvested our first <strong>Burpee's Pickalot      hybrid</strong> and <strong>Johnny's Northern      Pickling</strong> cukes on July 1 from vines just one foot      tall. The plants never got any larger, but the cukes (up to      five inches long) just kept coming. And both varieties had      excellent disease resistance (though squash bugs did ours      in late in the season).    </p>    <h3>      Carrots    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Napoli F1 Hybrid:</strong> Overall, Napoli seemed      more for market than home gardeners-it produced      excellent, uniform roots, but they had only average flavor.      The six-inch carrots have blunt ends and medium orange      flesh. (Johnny's)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mokum:</strong> Mokum is touted as an      excellent-tasting, early-maturing carrot. True, our May 11      sowing was ready for harvest a full month ahead of other      varieties, but, sadly, the taste was only average.      (Thompson & Morgan)<br />    </p>        <h3>      Flowers    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Primrose Gem chrysanthemum</strong> from Thompson      & Morgan has the notation WOW! in my notebook for June      8. On into early August, these compact 12-to 18-inch      globe-shaped plants were still producing masses of      feathery, straw-colored blooms with golden eyes. New for      1989, <strong>Pinata Hybrid Mixed gazania</strong> from      Burpee was one of my most exciting finds. The low, mounded,      silver-green plants began blooming on July 1. Way into      fall, the foliage still looked spring fresh and kept      putting out bold yellow, orange and red daisylike flowers.      <strong>Swiss Giants pansies</strong> from Seeds Blum had      lots of large, pretty faces to show off in spring.      Throughout the summer they continued blooming (where      planted under taller crops), and even in November      volunteers peeked out from among the cabbages and parsley.    </p>    <p>      However, <strong>Nolana Paradoxa-Blue Bird</strong> and      <strong>Lychnis X Haageana Mixed</strong> , both from      Thompson & Morgan, may be spectacular in other locales      but were failures in my trials. Nolana wasn't nearly as      lush and full as it looked in the catalogue picture, and my      Lychnis transplants withered away in the garden.    </p>        <h3>      Conclusion    </h3>    <p>      When I look back on last summer, I realize that a lot of      the new varieties performed quite well. But not so many      passed my personal acid test; i.e., earned a place in next      year's garden (when I don't have to grow them). Here's the      run-down of those new vegetables that I'll gladly be asking      for a return engagement. <strong>Sweet Million and Gold      Nugget cherry tomatoes. Dragon's Langerie wax bean,      Orobelle and Chile-Espanola peppers, Listada de Gandia      eggplant, Greenpeace kale, Ravella cauliflower and Italian      Green and Red Chard Mix.</strong>    </p>    <p>      But what about <em>1989's</em> irresistible-sounding      vegetables? Well, here are just a few that have me eager to      jump out of my wing chair: <strong>Tabasco pepper</strong>      from Shum-way's ( <em>the</em> scorching variety      responsible for that famous sauce). <strong>Elephant Head      amaranth</strong> from Peace Seeds (a thick-flowered      heirloom that "looks like purple elephants have taken root      in your garden"), <strong>Pod corn</strong> from Vermont      Bean Seed (kernels of this multicolored ornamental corn      each have primitive-looking little husks). <strong>County      Fair '87 cucumber</strong> from Park Seeds ("harvest with      <em>no</em> fear of disease"), <strong>Zucchetta Rampicante      summer squash</strong> from Shepherd's Seeds (an Italian      heirloom with a long, bulbing end that holds the seeds) and      <strong>Tomato St. Pierre</strong> from Redwood City Seeds      (reputed to produce an abundance of sweet, tender fruit      even under adverse conditions).    </p>    <p>      Sigh. I guess I'll be expanding the garden borders yet      again. That just goes to show what spending too much time      reading seed catalogues will do to you.    </p>
