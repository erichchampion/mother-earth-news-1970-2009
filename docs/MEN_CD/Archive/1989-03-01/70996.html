                    <p>      <em>This lighweight boat doubles as cartop storage and      suits the first-time boatbuilder.</em></p>			<h5 id="byline">       By Larry D. Warren and MOTHER'S staff			 </h5>      <p>      This job shouldn't be beyond the skills of a novice      carpenter.    </p>		    <p>      IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT YOU CAN have your cake and eat it too,      but if you find yourself whiling away your free hours      outdoors-camping, boating or just messing      around-and don't mind spending about $ 100 and a few      days of that leisure time puttering with a delightfully      simple wood project, that luxury can be yours any time you      please. This 8'-long craft isn't just a water-worthy      two-person row-boat, but at the flip of a latch becomes a      lock-able, weatherproof cartop carrier built to hold about      30 cubic feet of goods that might otherwise have been left      at home.    </p>    <p>      As a water lover-one who plans outings and vacations      around fishing, lakeside camping and searching out ponds      and rivers-I faced a choice: Hit the deep blue by      laying down some long green for the purchase of a proper      johnboat (and perhaps a trailer, registration and towing      package on top of that), or go on camping trips without.      Neither option appealed to me, so I took a third tack and,      although I'm no boatwright, chose to build a boat from      scratch, using basic techniques and materials simply      because that's all I had to work with.    </p>    <p>      All told, the project required three 4' X 8' sheets of      ¼” marine plywood. <em>[Editor's Note: Similar      boats have since been built using the less expensive B-C      exterior panels, but it's still anyone's guess as to how      well they'll hold up over time.]</em> In addition to the      plywood, I used 10 strips of ¾” X      1¼” blind stop (about 100 linear feet      altogether; they come in random lengths of 10' to 12' and      should bow without breaking), a 26” scrap of 1 X 4, a      1 ½” X 4' section of brass-plated continuous      hinge, two 1 ½” X 3 ½” galvanized      safety hasps, six reinforced staple plates to fit the      hasps, two 3 ½” eye-bolt snaps and a      1¼” X 3 ¾” locking draw pull      catch.    </p>    <p>      I salvaged the oars and pinned lock sets from another boat.      You'll need two pairs of oarlocks for this dinghy, since      they also serve to secure the oars when the vessel's      folded, creating a convenient set of carrying handles. Four      small eyebolt snaps hold the lock shafts in place.    </p>    <p>      For fasteners, I bought 800 No. 6 X ¾”      anodized drive screws, 18 in a No. 8 X 1½”      size and 16 more, 3” long. Eight No. 8-32 X 1”      flathead machine screws and 32 No. 8s, each ¾”      in length, were used to hold the metal hardware. The wood      joints and seams were glued and sealed with four 10-ounce      tubes of exterior construction adhesive. Finally, to button      up the box along the edges when it's used as a carrier, I      cut two 12” X 48” strips of colored vinyl      fabric and bought two dozen pairs of plated snap fasteners.    </p>    <p>      By this time, you're probably ready to get to work on your      <em>own</em> boat. Got two sawhorses and a sharp pencil?      Start by striking center lines (for reference) across two      pieces of plywood and marking the two lengthwise lines on      the third sheet at the points indicated in the      illustration. Then, on that same third sheet, go on to      measure and mark off the outlines of the center bulkheads,      the front and rear transoms and the two seats.    </p>    <p>      Now, on one of the center-marked panels, measure back      4” along each edge at all four comers, and, with the      help of a square, strike perpendicular lines from these      points to establish intersecting points near each corner.      Mark the plywood at the following distances in from each      long side: 19” at the corners and 15” at the      center line. This will be Sheet 1, as indicated in the plan      views.    </p>    <p>      Next, choose a clear-grained, straight piece of blind stop,      and mark its center on the widest face. Then clamp that      point to the edge of Sheet 1 at its center line. With a      buddy's help, urge the wooden strip into a bow, so its      outer edge meets the intersecting points at each end of the      panel. Clamp the wood in place, then scribe a line onto the      plywood, using the strip as a guide. Go on to repeat the      procedure with a second strip, this time using the center      line mark as a starting point and the 19" marks as a goal.      The process can be simplified if you use a pipe clamp to      hold the second strip in place while you bow the ends, and      cut some temporary spacers to fit between the strips in      order to keep them aligned.    </p>    <p>      When you've finished scribing the curves, strike a straight      line between the intersecting point and the 19" mark at      each end. If you cut out this one side with a jigsaw, you      can use it as a template to outline the other side on      what's left of the sheet, lining it up more or less with      the corner points you established earlier.    </p>    <p>      Now mark out the boat's bottom, which is the other      center-lined panel, on Sheet 2. This time, draw two      parallel lines across each end at points 2" and 4" from the      edge. Then use the square to strike lines perpendicular to      these, 6 ½” and 8" inward from each corner,      measured along the ends. Finally, on the center line,      indicate marks at points 1¼” and 2      ¾” inward from each side.    </p>    <p>      The bowing technique is the same. When you're finished,      you'll have traced four arcs onto the panel-two outer      ones, which you'll cut right away, and two inner ones      (marked as dotted lines in the illustration), which are      used for reference when assembling and trimming the hull      later on. Cut out the bottom panel, then halve it, as well      as the side sections, along the center line. Take care to      save the comers, because you'll need them next for making      the center gussets.    </p>    <p>      After removing the six main parts from Sheet 3, use the      detail provided to draw the outlines of the end and center      gussets on the scraps left over from the second and third      sheets. Trim out the eight gussets and set them aside for      later.    </p>    <h3>The Jig Is Up</h3>    <p>      The next few steps will require that you 1) make a small      bending jig out of 2 X 4s and 2) locate about 10 clamps to      temporarily secure the gunnel and bottom rails to the side      panels in preparation for fastening. The jig's a      snap-simply trim the lumber to the dimensions shown      in the illustration, cut out the reliefs in the long      members as indicated, and screw the frame together. Pay par      ticular attention to the placement of the center blocks,      since they dictate the degree of hull bow.    </p>    <p>      Once the jig's completed, you're ready to set up each of      the boat's side panels. Cut the upper and lower rails about      1' longer than necessary (that'll allow you a purchase when      bending them into position), and trim some small pads out      of scrap so the clamps don't damage the plywood. Lay a      uniform bead of adhesive along the back of the strips, then      clamp the square end of the panel and the rails to the jig.    </p>    <p>      Next, guide the panel down against the jig frame, and bow      the rails to meet their targets at the opposite end. Put      clamps at the center, the transom corners and the two areas      between, but don't secure them until you've set the rails      flush with the edges of the panel. That done, fasten them      permanently with a line of screws.    </p>    <p>      All four panels are formed in the same fashion, but you'll      have to let the adhesive on each one set before removing      the clamps for the next. In the meantime, if you have some      locking pliers, you can complete the framing on the two      transoms and center bulkheads.    </p>    <p>      These components aren't bowed, so assembling them requires      little more than cutting the strips to fit the panels (see      diagrams), laying a solid adhesive bead behind each piece      and locking the parts together before driving      screws-about 2" apart-from the plywood side. Be      aware that you'll have to plan for the 3" main screws that      will penetrate each corner, so leave room in those areas by      setting the end fasteners slightly lower than the others in      the row.    </p>    <h3>Bottoms Up</h3>    <p>      After about two days of curing time, it's safe to release      the assembled sections. In the next step, you'll be      squaring up the sides of one half of the boat in      preparation for fastening the corners. If you have a sheet      of rigid plywood, set it on a pair of sawhorses, and      measure off the location of the center line and the      corners-to-be, using the straight end of the plywood table      as a starting point.    </p>    <p>      Then clamp a center bulkhead, top rail down, to that edge,      and align the other three sections with the marks,      employing pipe clamps at the corners where needed.<br />      Next, by using a pair of compasses to scribe the correct      bevel onto the ends of the transom uprights (or by simply      marking a bevel angle of 105°), indicate the amount of      wood strip you'll have to remove to allow the side panels      to join flush with the ends of the transom, then unclamp      the sides.    </p>    <p>      You can use a circular saw, a jigsaw or even a belt sander      to trim the end bevels, as long as the finished surface is      fairly uniform. Once the corners are taken care of, use the      following procedure to level the bottom rails: First, lay      heavy glue beads along the edges of the transom and      bulkhead, and clamp the four sections together, squaring      them by the marks on the plywood table. Drive a row of      ¾” screws, 1½” apart, along the      edges of each side, then drill a 3/32” pilot hole and      sink a 3" main screw at each corner joint. Finally,      hand-plane the rail faces, taking care to maintain a      consistent angle as you work.    </p>    <p>      When the adhesive has cured, remove the clamps, and smooth      the beveled edges with a sanding block. Apply a heavy bead      of adhesive to the facing edge of the bottom rails, then      position and fasten the bottom panel in place, checking for      gaps as you work from the center to the ends and wiping      away excess glue with a rag. After an appropriate curing      time, use your jigsaw-set at the proper      angle-to cut the skirt and rail tips from around the      bottom panel.    </p>    <p>      Finally, cut a pair of strips 4' long, and center them      lengthwise on the outside of the bottom panel, 18" apart.      They act as stiffeners to flatten and support the plywood      and keep the hull square. Glue them in place, then fasten      one end of each piece from the outside. Draw the strips      down, and screw in the other ends; the centers are secured      from the inside with ¾” screws. Trim the ends      afterwards, being careful not to split the wood.    </p>    <p>      If you've come this far, you've completed half of the basic      boat. Start work on the other half, using the same plywood      table and measuring techniques to assure that both hulls      are symmetrical. While waiting for the glue to dry, you can      fill your time finishing the details described next, which      apply to both sections.    </p>    <h3>Gussets and Gunnels</h3>    <p>      Each corner is strengthened with the gussets cut earlier.      They're positioned about 1 1 / 2 " below the upper rails on      strips cut to fit the edges of each plate. Since the      transoms and sides are fixed at an angle, the supports have      to be beveled at the top; trial-fit the plates, and trace      their position on the hull. You can then determine the      necessary bevel by holding the strips to the line.    </p>    <p>      Once all the supports are trimmed, glue them in place and      fasten them from the outside with ¾” screws.      The gussets are secured from the top in the same way.    </p>    <p>      The seat supports are 9 ¾” strips attached to      the cross rails of the bulkheads and, 10 ½”      below the rails, to the transom backboards. Again, you'll      have to bevel the upper surfaces of the end strips so that      each seat lies flush. With the supports in place, check the      seat boards for fit, and trim length if needed. Then glue      and fasten the seat rails to the lower edges of the boards.      (You'll probably have to bevel the ends of the rails to      make them fit; the seats are meant to be removable and are      not screwed down.)    </p>    <p>      All that remains at this point is caulking, paintwork and      fastening the hardware. First, lay a solid bead of adhesive      onto the inside corner of each hull joint where the glue      hasn't already oozed out. Then seal the hull inside and out      with an exterior-grade sealer/primer or a water-sealing      primer. After it's dried, paint both sides of the hull with      an alkyd-based exterior or deck-and-floor paint, then go on      to decorate the trim in the complementary color of your      choice. Because the boat isn't meant to stay in the water,      a more costly marine finish isn't really necessary.    </p>    <p>      To fasten the hinge and draw pull catch, clamp both halves      of the boat squarely together in the folded position, and      center the hinge leaves at the bulkhead joint before      driving the screws. Secure the catch at the opposite end in      the same way.    </p>    <p>      Then open the craft, and position the hasp-and-staple      assemblies to bridge the center line, just above the floor.      Attach each component with ¾” machine screws      and nuts, using No. 8 flat washers or drilled sheet-metal      plates to protect the inner surface of the plywood. Two      more sets of staple plates-one pair used as front tie-down      eyes and the other to hold the hasp flaps when they're      idle-also get bolted on, the former to the lower bow      corners of the boat and the latter in the middle, next to      the hasps.    </p>    <p>      The oarlock mounts are bolted through the gunnel rails,      each pair 18" apart. The best way to position these is to      slip each oar through its two locks with the lock shafts      upside-down in the mounts. Then place the mounts against      the rails so the center ones are about 12" from the hinge.      Mark the holes, drill them, and use the 1" machine screws      as fasteners, countersinking the nuts slightly by boring a      larger opening at the bottom.    </p>    <p>      With the boat still unfolded, secure the lower edges of the      fabric strips, vinyl side out, to the inside edges of the      gunnels with some screw-point male snaps. Close the boat,      then pull the fabric around the oars, and place male snaps      at the corners and in the center of each oar shaft. Install      the female caps through the fabric to match the exposed      snaps.    </p>    <p>      This little clamshell of a boat has far surpassed my      original expectations. At 65 pounds unladen, it's light      enough for two people to lift on or off the roof racks      without much trouble. Our family has crisscrossed the East      Coast and the Midwest, toting it along without a hitch for      several years now, glad for the extra storage space. I've      even used it as an emergency lean-to on impromptu camping      trips. Am I pleased? You bet-and I'm also willing to      wager that a little folding boat will make you happy as a      clam, too!    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Admittedly, building a boat might be      somewhat intimidating to the workshop novice or to someone      who's not used to large wood projects.
