                    <h2 id="subtitle">      THE ORGANIC TREATMENT PLANT    </h2>    <p>      <em>Beneath your feet there's a society that runs on      oxygen.</em>    </p>    <p>      FAR FROM BEING MERELY A COLLECtion of minerals, healthy      soil is a working community whose business it is to recycle      most anything that passes by. Bacteria feed on pollutants      in the waste water. Viruses, in turn, seek out bacterial      hosts and live on their life fluids. Protozoa, the simplest      form of animal, prey on bacteria, and      nematodes-roundworms just visible to the      eye-consume organic matter of any kind.    </p>    <p>      Truly, there is no better cleanser and renovator than      living earth. A cleanser, because clay particles in the      soil act as electrostatic filters capable of adsorbing      virus pathogens before they can migrate; a renovator,      because microorganisms, as they work, transform harmful      microbes into carbon dioxide and soil nutrients, and      produce antibiotics in the bargain.    </p>    <p>      Oxygen is critical to the absorption field and the      creatures in it. Aerobic bacteria-those that thrive      in a well-aerated environment-are far better suited      to the chore of recycling effluent than are the anaerobic      varieties. Without sufficient oxygen, aerobic bacteria and      the protozoa that feed on them fall dormant or die. At this      point, anaerobic bacteria, fungi and yeasts will take over.    </p>    <p>      The anaerobic organisms work more slowly and give off less      heat. They also process waste material differently than the      aerobic variety, creating acids and methane rather than the      sugars and fixed nitrogen beneficial to the soil. Under      these conditions, ferrous sulfide forms and bonds with      algae and dead bacteria to make a layer of insoluble gum,      called the <em>organic mat</em> , that clogs soil pores and      restricts drainage. This clogging mat exists in limited      measure under aerobic conditions and is important to the      system as a natural filter. But when it spreads out of      control in unhealthy soil, the field will ultimately fail      to do its job.    </p>
