                    <p>      A mature plant can produce six pounds of stalk per year.    </p><hr />    <p>      The "tube technique" will help produce longer rhubarb      stalks.    </p>    <p>      The tart, tasty strawberry substitute.<br />    </p>    <h5 id="byline">       By Sara Pacher</h5>        <p>      YOU WON'T HAVE TO SPEND ALL winter and half the following      summer yearning for freshly picked, homegrown fruit once      you put in a rhubarb patch. Though this plant is actually a      perennial vegetable, its fruity-tasting stalks can be      transformed into delicious pies, sauces, jams, jellies and      conserves. They can also be baked or stewed and used as a      topping for hot cereal or to add a special zing when mixed      with other cooked fruit. The sweetened juice makes a      refreshing cold drink, and the pulverized stems, fermented      with sugar, will produce an interesting wine.    </p>    <p>      Curiously, despite its being delicious, low in calories and      fat and a good source of vitamin A, potassium and some      vitamin C, rhubarb was slow to reach the dinner table. The      type known as <em>Rheum officinale</em> has been cultivated      in China and Tibet for medicinal purposes for nearly 3,000      years, but <em>Rheum rhaponticum</em> , the parent plant of      most of the rhubarb we eat today, is thought to have      originated in the Volga River region of Siberia, and wasn't      introduced to Europe until the 17th century. From there, it      eventually made its way to this country, where it became      commonly known as "pie plant."    </p>    <h3>Types and Tastes</h3>    <p>      This hardy perennial grows two to four feet tall, sporting      enormous green leaves on strong red, green or reddish green      stalks. Both its leaves and roots contain oxalic acid,      which is poisonous, so only the stems (properly called      petioles) should be eaten.    </p>    <p>      Few people bother to grow rhubarb from seed, since doing so      would add yet another year to the three usually required to      produce the first good harvest. However, should you decide      to go this route, you'll probably be most successful with      an old-fashioned, very tart variety called Victoria, whose      green stalks are blushed with red. (When starting with      seeds, sow them one inch deep outdoors in April, thin the      seedlings to six inches apart, and then establish them in a      permanent bed in the fall.)    </p>    <p>      For a quicker, more reliable harvest, plant the fleshy root      divisions called crowns, or corms. You'll find them      available from many local and mail-order nurseries or from      a rhubarb-growing fellow gardener who is dividing old      plants. Just make sure each crown has two well-formed      "eyes" or buds.    </p>    <p>      Canada Red is one of the more popular varieties. Its heavy,      juicy stalks are tender and are bright red inside and out.      They keep their color when cooked, too, making them perfect      for canning or freezing. Furthermore, the plant is slow to      go to seed. Valentine is another sweet type that requires      very little sugar to make it delicious, but MacDonald is      sweeter still. Its big, bright red, flavorful stalks will      produce sauces and pies with a deep pink hue. It's also      unnecessary to scrape or peel MacDonald's tender      stalks-a definite advantage, since there are many      nutrients in the stalks' outer surfaces. Gardeners who      prefer a tarter variety should try Flare, whose stems may      be red or green.    </p>    <p>      When selecting a rhubarb, keep in mind that most varieties      like cool, moist summers and winters where temperatures are      cold enough to freeze the crowns and keep the plants      dormant. If the mean temperatures in your area are above 40      °F in winter and 75°F in summer, you should pick a      type, such as Cherry Red, that's more suited to mild      winters. (This particular cultivar has tart, juicy stalks      that are red on the outside and green inside.) In very warm      areas, where rhubarb is sometimes treated as an annual,      plants might remain dormant in the summer and leaf out in      the winter.    </p>            <h3>How to Plant</h3>    <p>      Since there's a long wait between planting and harvesting,      patience is required to grow rhubarb-but that      patience is well rewarded. Once established, you can reap      this attractive vegetable's succulent stalks for 10 to 15      years with a minimum of effort and with little worry about      pests or diseases, and it only takes some six to 10 plants      to provide    </p>    <p>      for an average family's needs. (A healthy, mature plant can      produce six or more pounds of edible rhubarb per year.)    </p>    <p>      True, rhubarb takes up quite a bit of space; three plants      require a 10-foot row. But rhubarb is too pretty to tuck      out of sight. People with small gardens might use it as      part of the front-yard landscape. Just remember, wherever      it's put, it will be there for years to come. And because      its home is relatively permanent, the initial preparation      of the rhubarb bed is very important.    </p>    <p>      In cool, temperate climates, choose a sunny, sheltered spot      to plant your crop, keeping in mind that rhubarb doesn't      compete well with tree or hedge roots or other cultivated      plants. In warmer climates, a semi-shaded area is probably      better, and in the Southwest, put the bed on the north side      of a fence or building to provide partial shade and      protection from drying winds.    </p>    <p>      While rhubarb does well in a variety of soils, it prefers a      sandy loam with a pH of 5.0 to 6.8 (5.8 is ideal). Whatever      the soil type, good drainage is essential, because soggy      earth will cause the roots to rot. Rhubarb is also a heavy      feeder, so-with plenty of well-rotted manure and      compost on hand-dig a bed, trench or individual holes      some two to three feet deep, setting aside the topsoil.      Fill the depression with compost and manure to within one      foot of the top. For each plant, mix in a shovelful of bone      meal or phosphate rock and two shovelfuls of granite dust      or greensand. The top layer should be a mixture of topsoil      and compost.    </p>    <p>      In the early spring (about four to six weeks before the      average date of the last frost), plant the crown divisions      (which should never be allowed to dry out) at three-foot      intervals in rows four feet apart. Place each corm two to      three inches deep-just enough to position the pink      growing tips an inch or two below the surface. Press the      earth down firmly, and water well.    </p>    <p>      Rhubarb likes even soil moisture and should never be      allowed to dry out completely, as this will cut both leaf      and stem production, so it's best to mulch with straw or      hay when the plants are about four inches tall. The mulch      will also help with the necessary task of keeping rhubarb      free from competing weeds. Whenever you <em>do</em> weed,      be careful not to injure the crowns.    </p>    <p>      Side-dress the plants with manure at least once during the      summer and again in the fall, and <em>always</em> remove      seed heads as soon as they appear. Though these flowering      stalks are quite attractive, seed production will sap the      energy necessary to produce leaves and stems. Once frost      has killed back the growth, cover the bed with a deep layer      of manure, leaf mold or compost to protect it from heavy      freezes.<br />      What to Watch For    </p>    <p>      If properly cultivated, you'll find rhubarb to be a      remarkably pest- and disease-free crop. Hand-pick      occasional leaf-eaters and destroy any wild dock growing      nearby to prevent infestations of rhubarb curculio, since i      dock is also a host to the larvae of these bee-I ties. The      tiny creatures punch holes in stalks ; and crowns for      feeding and for laying their eggs. Try, therefore, to pick      the adults be fore this happens. Failing that, spray with      rotenone.    </p>    <p>      As previously mentioned, soggy soil can cause root rot, or      phytophthora crown rot. (Roots that are past their prime      are particularly vulnerable.) The disease turns leaves a      dull gray-green and causes stems to be thin and limp,      except at their abnormally swollen bases. Infected plants      should be immediately lifted and destroyed before the      disease spreads. You should turn the earth to expose the      infected soil to the sun.    </p>    <h3>How to Harvest and Store</h3>    <p>      Don't harvest any of the rhubarb stalks the first year, as      all their strength needs to be put back into the roots. The      second year, you can cut a few stalks, but the first real      harvest will begin during spring of the third year. When      the stems are one to two feet tall and the leaves are      completely developed, grab a stalk near its base and      pull-don't cut-it cleanly from the crown with a      twisting motion. Remove any small pieces attached to the      crown, as these can deteriorate and encourage rot. You can      keep harvesting until July, but try not to take more than      one-third of the stalks from any one plant, in order to      guarantee a good harvest the next season.    </p>    <p>      Rhubarb will usually produce for many years, but once the      stems start to become slender and inferior, the roots need      to be dug up and divided. Do this when the plants are      dormant, either in the spring or fall. Use a sharp spade to      split the corms into four to six pieces, leaving two buds      and as much root as possible on each one, and replant them      in a well-prepared bed.<br />      Some gardeners routinely divide a few of their established      clumps in late October or early November in order to have a      constant supply of three-year-old roots for a winter      rhubarb harvest that's obtained by forcing. To do this, put      the root divisions in a box covered with moist soil, peat      or sand, and expose them to the cold for a couple of weeks.      Then move them indoors to a spot where the temperature is      above 47°F but below 60°F. (If the environment is      too cold, growth will be very slow; if too warm, the stalks      will be spindly and bland.) Lay the clumps close together      in a box, cover with sand or soil, water well, and cover      with another box and a sheet of black plastic to keep out      the light. Keep the soil moist, and in five to six weeks,      you can harvest a midwinter crop. (Expect tall and tasty      shoots, but very pale, small, folded-up leaves.) Once the      stems are pulled, you'll have to discard the worn-out      roots.    </p>    <p>      For a very early spring crop, you can also force rhubarb      outdoors, advancing the normal harvest by several weeks.      After the plants have been exposed to a few killing frosts,      just water them well, and cover a few with bottomless      boxes, barrels, buckets or oil drums, and devise some kind      of lid that will allow you to occasionally check on the      rhubarb's development. In very cold climates, you should      also heap leaves, compost or manure mixed with straw around      the outsides of these containers.    </p>    <p>      Rhubarb will keep well in the refrigerator for two to three      weeks. To can it, harvest about two pounds per quart.      Choose tender, nicely colored stalks, and (of course)      discard the leaves. Cut the rhubarb into one-inch pieces,      and put them in a large bowl. Cover them with one-half to      one cup of sugar, depending on the sweetness of the plant      and your own taste, and let this stand for three or four      hours until the rhubarb is floating in syrup. Heat the      rhubarb to boiling, and pack it into hot jars to within      one-half inch of the top. If you're short of syrup, bring      the liquid to that height with boiling water. Run a slim,      nonmetal tool around the inside of each jar to release air      bubbles, and add more syrup or boiling water if necessary.      Put on the lids according to the manufacturer's      instructions, and process the jars in a boiling water bath      for 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      To freeze rhubarb, wash tender young stalks, and cut them      into one- or two-inch pieces. Pack these unsweetened into      containers, then seal and freeze them-or sweeten and      boil the rhubarb before packaging, leaving one-half inch of      headspace in the containers. Frozen rhubarb will keep for      approximately one year.    </p>		<p>    <strong>Rhubarb Cake</strong><br />      1 / 2 cup unsalted butter<br />      1 1 / 4 cups light brown sugar 2 eggs<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      2 tablespoons cinnamon<br />      1 1 / 2 cups sifted cake flour<br />      1 teaspoon baking soda<br />      1/3 cup buttermilk, yogurt or sour cream<br />      1 1 / 2 cups rhubarb, cut into 1 / 2 " pieces<br />      1 / 1 cup granulated sugar<br />      <br />      Preheat oven to 375°F. Cream butter with brown sugar in      a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a      time, then beat in vanilla and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Sift      flour and baking soda, and beat this mixture into butter      mixture in three parts, alternating with buttermilk. Fold      in rhubarb. Pour batter into standard 8" X 8" X 2" glass      baking dish. Blend sugar and remaining cinnamon, and      sprinkle over top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the      cake comes out clean (about 45 minutes). If the top starts      to brown too quickly, lower the oven temperature to      350°F for the last 30 minutes. Top with whipped cream      or ice cream.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rhubarb Ice</strong><br />      1 cup water<br />      1 cup sugar<br />      1 1 / 2 pounds young rhubarb<br />      Juice of 1 lemon<br />      1 pint small strawberries<br />      <br />      Combine water and sugar in a saucepan, and bring to a boil      to form a syrup. Simmer for 5 minutes while stirring. Add      rhubarb, and cook until tender. Add lemon juice and      strawberries, and press through a sieve. Put in a covered      plastic container, and store in freezer until      <em>almost</em> frozen. Take out, scrape down, and      refreeze. This recipe will keep well in the freezer for      about three weeks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rhubarb Chutney</strong><br />      6 cups diced rhubarb<br />      2 cups sugar<br />      1 1 / 2 cups raisins<br />      1 / 2 cup chopped onion<br />      1 / 2 cup vinegar<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1 teaspoon ginger<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1 teaspoon allspice<br />      1 / 2 cup chopped walnuts    </p>    <p>      Put all ingredients except walnuts in a heavy-bottomed      saucepan, and heat to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, and      cook, stirring frequently, for about 30 minutes or until      thickened. Cool, then stir in walnuts. Store in a covered      container in the refrigerator, where it will keep for at      least a month.    </p><hr />    <h3>SUSAN SATS</h3>    <p>      <strong>RHUBARB RECIPES BY G. HAYES</strong>    </p>    <p>      MOTHER'S GARDENER, SUSAN SIDES, has some advice that's an      exception to a rule:<br />      Gardeners are nearly always admonished not to let plants of      any kind become leggy, yet with rhubarb that's just what      you want. Here's a trick for creating longer, more tender      rhubarb stalks.    </p>    <p>      Not to be confused with <em>forcing</em> , which is a means      of stimulating earlier than normal growth, the "tube      technique" simply elongates stalks by making plants "reach      for the skies."    </p>    <p>      In early spring, place a large clay pipe, a bottomless      bushel basket or a similar tube-shaped object over some of      your outdoor rhubarb plants. Be sure to gather up the      leaves so they're pointing upward inside the chamber.      Following their natural tendency to strain toward light,      the leaves will clamber to the top, supported by taller      than normal, succulent stalks-all the more for the      makings of that rhubarb cobbler.<br />    </p>
