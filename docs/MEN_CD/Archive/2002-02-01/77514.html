        <p id="byline">I have been gardening for many years, and as I've grown older, I've had to figure out new ways to do some things because of back trouble. I am a firm believer in composting, and as the years passed I got to the place where I couldn't turn over the pile. Since I'm an idea person, I came up with a solution that works well for me.</p><p>When I have vegetable peelings and other nonmeat scraps that I used to put in my compost pile, now I just run them through my blender. I use rainwater for the liquid, because I don't use chemicals of any kind on my garden. The peelings are coarse, but afterward everything is nicely pureed. This can be dumped right on your garden. I prefer to dig holes, put it in and cover it up. My son is obliging when he visits and digs me 25 to 30 holes, which last me quite a while. Using holes cuts down on the chance of encountering bad odors during warm weather. With this method anyone can do composting and get the wonderful benefits for their garden.</p><p>WINNIE SCHUETZ<br />Tilden, Illinois</p>
