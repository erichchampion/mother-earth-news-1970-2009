            		        <h5 id="byline">      by Brook Elliott    </h5>	  <p>			<strong>Â· Photography by David Cavagnaro</strong>		</p>            <p>      I hated them. The juice from the tomato and its thin walls      would turn everything into a mushy mess.    </p>    <p>      Things would have been different if Mom had known about      stuffing tomatoes: varieties developed specifically for      that pur pose. Resembling bell peppers, stuffing tomatoes      are thick-walled, hollow and relatively juice free. "When      you slice one open, the seed gel is in the middle and the      rest is hollow," says Marianne Jones, who stocks seed for      nine different stuffers at Marianna's Heirloom Seeds, in      Dickson, Tennessee. "Sales are not big," she says, "but      that's only because people don't know about them and how      much fun they are."    </p>    <p>      Stuffing tomatoes are more popular with chefs - when they      can get them - than with the gardening public. Chefs like      them because they make beautiful, decorative presentations      for both cold and hot dishes.    </p>    <p>      Even without widespread popularity, <strong>stuffing      tomatoes come in incredible ranges of size, shape and      color.</strong> On one end of the continuum are varieties      like `Coursen Roy's,' a large, reddish-orange tomato with a      fairly standard round shape, albeit slightly taller than it      is wide. On the other end is 'Zapotec Pink Pleated,' a      heavily ribbed, double-bowled tomato that's a true pink      color. 'Zapotec Pink' looks as if two smaller, fig-shaped      tomatoes were stuck together. 'Schimmeig Striped Hollow'      looks like a striated 'Delicious' apple - red with yellow      and orange markings.    </p>            <p>      Most of the stuffers, however, look like lobed bell peppers      and come in single colors, such as 'Yellow Stuffer' and      'Orange Stuffer,' which are the most commonly available      varieties. They are configured inside like bell peppers, as      well. When you cut the top off, you'll find the seed mass      forms a "strawberry" just under the stem. The rest is      hollow, except for a few ribs in some varieties. The flesh      is thick and moist, but not runny.    </p>    <p>      <strong>			Even without widespread popularity, stuffing tomatoes come      in incredible ranges of size, shape and color.			</strong>    </p>    <p>      Stuffers, according to Darrell "The Tomato Man" Merrell,      are among the earliest tomato cultivars. "They're almost      all from Mexico originally," the Tulsa, Oklahoma, resident      says. "Precontact Aztecs were great tomato cultivators,      much more so than South American tribes - even though      tomatoes originated there."    </p>    <p>      Lacking the broad appeal that attracts large-scale      commercial growers, stuffing tomatoes have been kept going      primarily by amateur growers, small market farmers and      specialty seed houses. They are showing up now in      mainstream seed catalogs. The chart, A Super Selection of      Stuffing Tomatoes , includes 11 varieties and four      mail-order sources.    </p>    <p>      Stuffers are said to score low on the flavor scale. Perhaps      so, but many do have a rich, tomato taste with little      acidity to overpower the flavors of the food put inside      them. Many people cut them up into salads instead of using      standard slicing tomatoes. The stutters provide a tomato      taste that complements the other salad ingredients without      dominating them.    </p>    <p>      You're not likely to find stuffers at the supermarket or      farm stand yet, which means you'll have to grow them      yourself. Seed is readily available, with many seed houses      stocking at least one type.    </p>    <p>      Stuffers are grown the same way as any other tomato.      However, because you'll be using them as edible bowls, it's      more important that you prevent blemishes from blight, bug      bites and cracking. While you could cut out such blemishes,      it detracts from the overall appearance of the dish,      especially when the tomato is used raw as a salad bowl. If      you grow for the market, bear in mind that chefs will not      accept blemished stuffers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The secret to blemish-free fruit is      airspace.</strong> Space plants at least 30 inches apart,      in rows at least 3 feet apart, and thin out any excess      growth. Consistent watering is particularly important, both      to fend off blossom-end rot and to prevent cracking. Most      stuffing tomatoes produce large, brushy, indeterminate      plants that need strong support. I recommend growing them      in wire-mesh towers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>One potential downside to growing stuffers is that      they are very prolific.</strong> 'Schimmeig Striped      Hollow,' for instance, seems to put out as many fruits as a      cherry tomato plant. And 'Coursen Roy's' definitely does.      Bobbi Cavanaugh, codirector of New Jersey's Garden State      Heirloom Seed Society, has found that stuffers can be      frozen and still serve for cooked dishes. "Top and core the      tomatoes and drain any liquid," she says. "Put in freezer      bags, squeezing out as much air as possible. Freeze."    </p>    <p>      When ready to use, remove as many as you need, she says.      "Put them in a barely warm oven - not more than 250      degrees. Drain the water as they defrost. When they are      thawed but not cooked - about 15 to 20 minutes - fill with      stuffing and bake as the recipe requires."    </p>    <p>      Now, see Tomato Bowls for some new dishes you can make with      your stuffers.    </p>
