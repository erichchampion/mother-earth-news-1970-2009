                    <h5 id="byline">      by CARMEL MOONEY    </h5>        <p>      One summer several years back, I had such an abundance of      homegrown tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and herbs in my      summer garden that I decided to make some salsa. I bought      some canning books and supplies and was so surprised how      easy and delicious it was that I began trying jams,      jellies, pickles and curds.    </p>    <p>      That fall my 4-year-old, Laura, and I spent hours picking      and squeezing lemons and oranges from all the neighbors'      trees to make curd. The curd was so good that Laura even      preferred a peanut butter-and-curd sandwich over anything      else for her lunches. The kids at school loved her curd      sandwiches so much their moms began asking for our recipe.      I knew I was on to something.    </p>    <p>      About five summers ago, not having any idea what I was in      for, I finally took the plunge and entered raspberry jam,      lemon curd, garden salsa, dill pickles and tomatoes in the      California State Fair. To my delight I won a blue ribbon      for my jam and curd, a red ribbon for my salsa and a white      ribbon for my pickles. I was hooked!    </p>    <p>      Now I've taken canning to a new level of experimentation.      After seeing some of the unusual creations entered each      year, I've enjoyed making up some of my own inventions that      have become quite successful. Two years ago I won a blue      ribbon for my raspberry mocha jelly, and the year before      that I even went to a pumpkin farm the day after Halloween      and brought home 50 pumpkins to make into pumpkin jelly. A      little dash of pumpkin pie spice in my pumpkin jelly and I      was on to another blue ribbon winner.    </p>    <p>      Every Christmas my friends and family now look forward to a      gift basket filled with my award-winning samples. One year      my husband even built special handcrafted redwood planter      boxes that I filled with my wares for holiday gifts. They      were a hit.    </p>    <p>      CARMEL MOONEY<br />      Auburn, California<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Carmel Mooney was one of three essay writers to be      selected as judges in</em> Grit <em>and</em> <em>MOTHER      EARTH NEWS'</em> <em>World Championship of Canning held      last September.</em> <em>-MOTHER</em>    </p>
