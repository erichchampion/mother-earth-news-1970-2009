            		        <h5 id="byline">      By James Duke, Ph.D.    </h5>            <p>      This practice, called urtication - from nettle's botanical      name, Urtica dioica - dates back at least 2,000 years.      Although it's an odd-sounding practice, there's no escaping      the fact that it's been around so long precisely because it      helps so many people.    </p>    <p>      Our banjo player kept a plant in his kitchen so he could      self-urticate when his arthritis flared up. The guitar      player's mother-in-law was unable to write because of      arthritis in her hands, but the sting of the nettle      improved that. The fiddle player's mother soon had stinging      nettle taking over her garden and said her arthritis was      much improved.    </p>    <p>      Just so you don't think that urtication is something only      crazy musicians indulge in, my former secretary at the U.S.      Department of Agriculture (USDA) kept a nettle plant in the      office. She would use the nettle to discreetly sting      herself when arthritis stiffened her fingers. On a      before-and-after photocopied image of her hand, you could      see how the swelling went down.    </p>    <p>      Urtication often provides considerable relief, sometimes      very quickly. I've seen arthritic swelling subside within      minutes after the stings were administered.    </p>    <h3>THE CASE FOR THE STING</h3>    <p>      I'm open to the notion that stinging nettle's      anti-arthritis action is based on distraction, meaning the      irritation of the sting simply takes people's minds off      their arthritis pain. That's an explanation you might hear      from medical doctors. But as a botanist, I think what's      going on is more chemical than psychological.    </p>    <p>      The tiny stingers of the nettle plant provide      microinjections of several chemicals responsible for the      stinging sensation the plant causes. One M.D. told me many      of these chemicals might also trigger anti-inflammation      action that would help relieve arthritis. The sting injects      a histaminic substance and the body mounts an      antihistaminic reaction, some of which goes to the sting,      some to the other inflammation.    </p>    <p>      On every continent where it grows, stinging nettle has      developed a reputation as a treatment for arthritis. I      don't think that's a coincidence. If you'd like to give      urtication a try, you shouldn't have much problem locating      a plant. It's a common weed throughout most of the United      States. If you're not sure how to identify it, someone who      works at a plant nursery or your local county agricultural      extension agent should be able to help.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation suggests that three      milligrams of boron, taken daily, may be helpful in      treating osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis</strong>    </p>    <h3>JOINTS IN TROUBLE</h3>    <p>      Arthritis literally means "joint inflammation." According      to the Arthritis Foundation, there are more that 100      different diseases that produce joint pain and inflammation      - everything from the flu to certain cancers. But when      people say "arthritis," they usually mean osteoarthritis.    </p>    <p>      Also known as degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis is      the most prevalent of more than a dozen different kinds of      arthritis. Some 16 million Americans have it. The hips,      knees, spine and tiny joints of the hands and feet are most      frequently affected. Osteoarthritis usually develops      gradually, beginning with minor aches that eventually lead      to extended pain, stiffness, swelling and limited range of      motion. Symptoms sometimes, but not always, subside with      gentle physical activity.    </p>    <p>      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), another form of arthritis, has a      nasty reputation because it can cause crippling joint      deformity. But many of the 2.1 million Americans with RA -      approximately 75 percent of whom are women - have milder,      noncrippling cases that flare up and subside mysteriously.    </p>    <p>      Frequently both hands are affected, but RA can strike other      joints, as well. In addition to joint pain, swelling and      warmth, possible symptoms include fatigue, fever, loss of      appetite, enlarged lymph nodes, lumps under the skin and      muscle stiffness after sleep or inactivity. Stiffness      usually subsides with moderate activity.    </p>    <h3>GREEN PHARMACY FOR ARTHRITIS</h3>    <p>      Along with stinging nettle, there are a number of other      herbs that can help.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ginger</strong> (Zingiber officinale), and      <strong>turmeric</strong> (Curcuma longo). I con sider      these the herbal alternative to the new drugs Celebrex and      Vioxx. In one study, Indian researchers gave three to seven      grams (1 1/2 to 3 1//2 teaspoons) of ginger a day to 18      people with osteoarthritis and 28 with rheumatoid      arthritis. More than 75 percent of those participating in      the study reported at least some relief from pain and      swelling. Even after more than two years of taking these      high doses of ginger, none of the people reported side      effects. Turmeric contains close chemical relatives of      compounds found in ginger, so I'm not surprised this herb      also has a major reputation as an arthritis treatment.    </p>    <p>      You can enjoy both herbs in a wide variety of spicy dishes,      as well as using them for teas.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Pineapple</strong> (Ananas Comosus). Some      intriguing research suggests bromelain, a chemical in      pineapple, helps prevent inflammation. For some time now,      athletic trainers have been recommending pineapple to      athletes to prevent and treat sports injuries. It's also a      good bet for people with arthritis. Bromelain can help the      body get rid immune antigen complex, compounds that are      implicated in some arthritis conditions. It also helps      digest fibrin, another compound suspected of being involved      in some types of arthritis. If you need an excuse to      indulge yourself with fresh, ripe pineapple, this is it.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Red Pepper</strong> (Capsicum, various species). Red pepper causes      some pain on the tongue but ironically interferes with pain      perception elsewhere around the body. The pain-relieving      chemical in red pepper, capsaicin, triggers the body to      release endorphins, nature's own opiates. Red pepper also      contains aspirin-like compounds known as salicylates.    </p>    <p>      You can make a tea by mixing red pepper into water, but it      would be a whole lot more pleasurable to have your red      pepper cooked in a variety of spicy dishes. For a quick      hit, try a splash of hot-pepper sauce in tomato juice. Just      biting into a hot pepper releases some of your own      painkillers into your body.    </p>    <p>      Compounds in red pepper can also help relieve arthritis      when you apply the herb to the skin. Researchers have      discovered you'll get significant pain relief if you apply      capsaicin cream directly to painful arthritic joints four      times daily. In one study of this treatment, the capsaicin      cream reduced RA pain by more than half. Osteoarthritis      pain was reduced by about one third.    </p>    <p>      Look for capsaicin in the ingredient list of      over-the-counter pain creams such as Zostrix and Capzasin-P      or ask your doctor for a prescription capsaicin product. If      you use capsaicin cream, be sure to wash your hands      thoroughly afterward: You don't want to get it in your eyes      or other tender places. Some people are quite sensitive to      this compound, so test it on a small area of skin to make      sure that it's OK for you to use. If it irritates your      skin, don't use it.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Stinging Nettle</strong> (Urtica dioica). Beyond      stinging painful joints, there's another method of using      this herb to treat arthritis: steaming the fresh leaves and      enjoying then as a vegetable. Although you have to wear      gloves to harvest the leaves, they lose their sting when      cooked.    </p>    <p>      The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation suggests that three      milligrams of boron daily may be helpful in treating both      os teo- and rheumatoid arthritis. An analysis of stinging      nettle provided by USDA scientists shows this herb contains      47 parts per million of the mineral boron, figured on a      dry-weight basis. That means a 100-gram serving of stinging      nettle - easily prepared by steaming several ounces of      young, tender leaves - could contain more than the      recommended amount of boron.    </p>    <p>      According to the Rheumatoid Disease Foundation, boron is      effective because it plays a role in helping bones retain      calcium. It also has a beneficial influence on the body's      hormonal system, and hor mones play a role in helping the      body maintain healthy bones and joints.    </p>    <h3>      Dr. Duke's Arthritis Broth    </h3>    <p>      To make this broth, begin with a couple of cups of water      and add red pepper, burdock, black pepper, celery seed,      dandelion, garlic, ginger, horseradish, juniper,      lemongrass, oregano, parsley, sarsaparilla, thyme,      turmeric, valerian, watercress, white mustard and willow      bark. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer      for a few minutes.    </p>    <p>      I confess I have never made this broth in its entirety. I      just opportunistically seize any of these ingredients that      are near at hand. If you press me for a recipe, I'd say use      four dashes each of burdock, dandelion, parsley, turmeric      and watercress; two dashes of celery seed, garlic, ginger      and oregano; and one dash each of the others, as available.      If this is too spicy for you, alter the recipe to suit your      taste.<br />      <br />      <strong>Multimint</strong> <strong>Antioxidant Arthritis      Tea</strong><br />      <br /> Rosemary and oregano are both antioxidant      mints. Add several more antioxidant herbs to these two, and      you get my Multimint Antioxidant Tea.The mints are basil,      bee balm, horehound, hyssop, lemon balm (also known as      melissa), marjoram, oregano, peppermint, rosemary, sage,      savory, spearmint and thyme. It makes sense to top it off      with a dash of ginger and turmeric. Many of these mints are      loaded with not one but several COX-2-inhibitors. Oregano      has more COX 2-inhibiting rosmarinic acid than rosemary      itself.    </p>    <p>      I checked my database to see if, in addition to their      antioxidant value, any of these herbs contain proven      anti-arthritis compounds. Sure enough, basil had five,      while marjoram, oregano and rosemary weighed in with a few      each. How much of each herb should you use to make this      tea? My teas are never the same; I use a little of this and      a little of that. To satisfy people who need recipes, I'll      say use two parts of the ingredients you like and one part      of those you find less appealing. Pour boiling water over      the herbs and let them steep for 10 to 20 minutes before      drinking.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oregano</strong> (Origanum vulgare). Studies are      accumulating that the pizza herb, oregano, is a powerful      antioxidant. Like other antioxidants contained in fruits      and vegetables, the compounds in oregano may help prevent      the cell damage caused by free radicals - highly unstable      oxygen molecules that steal elec trons from other molecules      they encounter. Free radical reactions are probably      involved in inflammation, degenerative arthritis and the      aging process in general. And evidence is accumulating that      an tioxidants may help relieve osteo- and rheumatoid      arthritis.    </p>    <p>      In a test of nearly 100 plants in the mint family, of which      oregano is a member, the pizza herb was the one that had      the greatest total antioxidant activity. Research has shown      the antioxidant activity of oregano and other medicinal      mints is due in large part to rosmarinic acid, a compound      with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and      antiviral properties. Considering how highly it ranks for      this kind of protection, oregano is definitely worth adding      to your pizza, or any other food, if you have arthritis.      You could also try my Multimint Antioxidant Arthritis Tea      (see recipe above ).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Willow</strong> (Salix, various species),      <strong>garlic</strong> (Album sativum) and      <strong>licorice</strong> (Glycyrrhiza glabra). Willow bark      was the original herbal aspirin. It contains a chemical      called salicin, which Bayer eventually transformed into      little white tablets of acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin.    </p>    <p>      Willow bark tea had pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory      effects similar to those of aspirin. But because the      irritation-causing ingredient in aspirin is diluted in tea,      you'll have less risk of stomach upset, ulcer and overdose      if you take the tea instead of the pills.    </p>    <p>      Still, because willow bark might upset your stomach, I've      included licorice in this formula. Not only does licorice      have antiinflammatory effects, it may also help treat any      gastrointestinal problems caused by the willow.    </p>    <p>      But the formula is not quite complete without garlic. While      long-term use or ingestion of large amounts of licorice can      raise some people's blood pressure and lead to other      problems (headache, lethargy, sodium and water retention,      excessive loss of potassium), garlic helps reduce blood      pressure. <strong>So here's the formula for a well-balanced      anti-arthritis tea: approximately three parts dried willow      bark, two parts dried licorice root and one part minced      garlic.</strong> Pour boiling water over the mixture and      steep for about 15 minutes. If you don't like the taste,      add lemon and/or honey, plus ginger and turmeric to taste.    </p>    <p>      <strong>When you're nibbling mixed ruts in company, don't apologize      for monopolizing the Brazil nuts.<br /></strong>    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Arthritis Soup    </h3>    <p>      Here's one for people who like quantitative recipes.    </p>    <p>      Start by combining the main ingredients, then season them      with dashes of any of the spices and flavors that appeal to      you. You don't need all of every one of these, and you can      play with the proportions and flavors, if you like. If an      ingredient doesn't appeal to you or is unavailable, simply      leave it out.    </p>    <p>      <br />      <em>3-4 quarts water<br /></em> <em>2 cups chopped      cabbage</em><br />      <em>1 cup sliced string beans (1-inch</em>      <em>pieces)</em><br />      <em>1 cup chopped celery<br />      1 cup stinging nettle leaves 1/2 cup diced carrot cup<br />      1/2 chopped asparagus<br />      1/2 cup dandelion leaves<br />      1/2 cup finely chopped dandelion root<br />      1/4 cup chopped spinach<br />      1/4 cup cubed eggplant<br />      1/4 cup chopped chicory<br />      2 tablespoons minced garlic<br />      2 tablespoons turmeric<br />      2 tablespoons licorice<br />      2 tablespoons evening primrose</em> <em>seeds<br /></em>      <em>ground black pepper<br />      ground red pepper<br />      white mustard<br />      flaxseed sarsaparilla<br />      fenugreek<br />      lemon juice</em>    </p>    <p>      Place the water in a large soup pot. Add the cabbage,      beans, celery, nettle, carrots, asparagus, dandelion      leaves, dandelion root, spinach, eggplant, chicory, garlic,      turmeric, licorice and evening primrose seeds. Season with      the black pepper, red pepper, mustard, flaxseed,      sarsaparilla, fenugreek and lemon juice. Bring to a boil      over high heat. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 20 to      30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.    </p>    <p>      Serves four.    </p>		</div>    <p>      <strong>Celery seed</strong> Since I wrote <em>The Green      Pharmacy</em> several years ago, I have not had a single      attack of gout, one especially painful type of arthritis. I      started taking celery seed when I read it helps lower      levels of uric acid - the gout culprit. In my database at      the USDA <em>( www.ars-grin.gov/duke ),</em> I found there      are nearly two dozen antiinflammatory compounds in celery,      including one very important "miracle aspirin" called      apigenin. I now enjoy curried celery when I'm not on the      road, celery seed extracts when I am. And celery or      serendipity has prevented my gout for more than six years      now. (Knock my wooden leg.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Brazil nut</strong> (Bertholettia excelsa) and      <strong>sunflower</strong> (Helianthus annus). SAM is      shorthand for S-adenosyl-methionine, a chemical shown to      have pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties      similar to those found in the over-the-counter medication      ibuprofen.    </p>    <p>      SAM can be found in high-methionine seeds and Brazil nuts.      It would take 250 grams of sunflower seeds (about 9 ounces)      of 500 grams of Brazil nuts (18 ounces) to provide a dose      of SAM that's more effective than a standard dose of      ibuprofen. It's not feasible to eat that many nuts and      seeds, but every little bit helps, especially if you use      the other natural approaches this article recommends.    </p>    <p>      Go ahead and sprinkle some sunflower seeds on your salad.      And when you're nibbling mixed nuts in company, don't      apologize for monopolizing the Brazil nuts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broccoli</strong> (Brassica oleracea) and other      herbs containing glutathione. Studies indicate people who      are low in the antioxidant compound glutathione are more      likely to have arthritis than those who have higher      amounts. Vegetables rich in glutathione include asparagus,      cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, tomatoes and purslane.      Fruits with healthy amounts include avocados, grapefruit,      oranges, peaches and watermelon.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rosemary</strong> (Rosmarinus officinalis).      Rosemary was known in antiquity as the herb of remembrance,      which is fitting, since rosemary has antioxidants that help      prevent aging in cells, and the aging process is certainly      associated with memory loss. One Greek American herb grower      tells how her fishing relatives set out to sea with fish      dishes heavily covered with rosemary. Even when it was      unrefrigerated, this food lasted for days, thanks in part      to the antioxidant activity <em>of</em> the rose mary.    </p>    <p>      Can an herb that keeps fish from spoiling help preserve      your youth? The jury is still out on that one, but rosemary      has preservative powers comparable to the commercial      preservatives BHA and BHT. And since we know that      antioxidants do help treat arthritis, it makes sense that      this antioxidant-rich herb would help thwart this disease.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vitamin C</strong> Vitamin C inhibits the      progression of osteoarthritis in guinea pigs. Does it work      in humans? There's no proof yet that it does. But it      certainly can't hurt to get more vitamin C. Red pepper and      many <em>of</em> the other herbs and vegetables mentioned      in this chapter contain good amounts.    </p>    <p>      Look for more excerpts from James Duke's <em>The Green      Pharmacy</em> in future issues of <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.
