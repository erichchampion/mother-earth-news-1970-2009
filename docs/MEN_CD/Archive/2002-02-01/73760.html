                				    <h5 id="byline">      Story and photos by<br /> Gary Voshell    </h5>         <p>      Through some strange quirk of physics, every year the rows      in my garden seem to get a little longer, the weeds' roots      get a little deeper and my hoe's handle gets a little      harder. Some would say this is from advancing age, but that      obviously isn't possible, since I'm as young as I was 15      years ago.    </p>    <p>      Besides these strange developments, I also find the demand      in my area for my good, fresh, organic produce grows every      year. Expanding my gardens seemed the wise choice, but it      was going to require more power than just one man could      produce. I needed a cultivator, but a store-bought one for      use in a small field or garden was out of my price range      (more than $1,000).    </p>    <p>      So I raided my ever-useful scrap wood pile and made a      cultivator to pull behind my trusty all terrain vehicle      (ATV). I think by reading my story you could do it, too. I      don't have a formula to follow: The beauty of my system is      it uses what's available.    </p>    <p>      I made the tongue from a 6-foot-long, red oak 4x4. Since      the width of my ATV is 42 inches, I made the cultivator 46      inches wide to wipe out tire tracks as I went. I made room      for diggers in the length, making the cultivator 42 inches      long. You can decide your own needs and design accordingly.    </p>        <p>      On the port and starboard sides, screw two 2x4s. (You      should now have a thing that looks like a horse-drawn drag      without teeth.) Drill appropriate holes for the draw pin to      fit in on the draw bar of your tractor or ATV. Get a couple      of pieces of flat iron about 12 inches long, 1/4 inch thick      and 1 1/2 inches wide. Attach these two pieces of iron to      the top and bottom of the tongue.    </p>    <p>      I used some scraps of 2x12 pine, just wide enough to make      circular cutouts for wheels that were 11 inches in      diameter. Cut them out with a jigsaw and mark the center      while you are there. I found an old piece of well pipe,      about 1 1/4x24 inches long, which made a great axle. Use a      hole saw and electric hand drill to make the holes in the      center of the wheels for the axle to run through. Use      cotter pins through the axle on both sides and washers on      either side of each wheel to keep the wheels from running      off when you turn corners.    </p>    <p>      I scavenged my digging tines from an old field cultivator      ("quack digger"). I put the tines on the machine, took a      piece of pretty sturdy 1/2-inch steel rod, ran it through      the hole mounts and secured them on both sides of the      machine.    </p>    <p>      The lifting of the tines could be done with an expensive      electromechanical device, but I found a simple piece of 4x4      red oak, spanning the width of the cultivator, does the      same thing. The closer you put the wood to the axle of the      tines, the higher the tines will raise for transporting      requirements.    </p>    <p>      As trial and effort showed, it takes three or four trips      over hard, overgrown ground to make the soil workable      enough to plant.    </p>    <p>      Early spring is the best time to put this cultivator to      work, before first growth starts.    </p>    <p>      That's it. Of course, these are the materials I had access      to. You can substitute materials lying around your yard. As      an Iowan, I deal mostly in facts, and the fact of the      matter is that you don't have to spend a lot to mechanize      your operation, too.    </p>    <p>      <br />      Fully detailed plans, parts list and instructions are      available by sending $10 to:<br />      <strong>AN Field Cultivator Plan P.O.
