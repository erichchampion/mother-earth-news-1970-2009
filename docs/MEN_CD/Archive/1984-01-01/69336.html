                <p>      <strong>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Ever since its inception, this magazine has preached      she importance of our 'Preserving the unique planet on      which we live and has stressed the inevitably dire results      of failing to do so. This month, rather than going into the      short-term economic consequences of our "over-consumption      folly"; we're going to look at the topic front another      perspective . . . namely, one 'hat looks back on our      current situation with the 20/20 hindsight of a person      living in the next century!</em><br />      <br />      <em>The following excerpted address, given by Colorado's      Governor Richard D. Lamm at the National Audubon convention      last summer, pretends to actually have been delivered by      ":Secretary of the Interior" Lamm to the 100th anniversary      celebration of that same conservation group in the year      2005. "Secretary" Lamm uses this future-view device in a      tongue-in-cheek manner, but we think you'll find some real      food for thought in the possibilities he presents. They      serve as a further reminder of how important it is that all      of its-individuals and nations alike-constantly      cherish our connection with the earth and use resources      that we can provide for ourselves on a sustainable basis      For this type of economic strength is truly the only secure      one . . . for us and for our planet.</em><br />      <br />      I appreciate your invitation to address your convention      and, as Secretary of the Interior, I am honored to be here      in this momentous year to celebrate the 100th anniversary      of the incorporation of the Audubon Society.<br />      <br />      The President has sent me here to defend the record of this      administration. We do not appreciate the strident and      coercive criticism we are receiving from conservation      groups in general or from this group specifically. The      President is doing the best she can, and has asked me to      come and respond to your criticisms. I sincerely believe      this President is a dedicated environmentalist, unlike some      predecessors in the Oval Office. Unfortunately, she does      not have the choices that were available in the late 20th      century. We do not believe you understand all the pressure      on this administration as we enter the 21st century. We do      not have the options they had back in the 1970s, the 1980s,      or even the 1990s. We live in a world that is crowded,      hungry, and in conflict. These matters demand your total      attention.<br />      <br />      Let me start by saying that I really do sympathize with      your viewpoints, but you must try to understand some of the      problems we have running a country of 430 million people,      and dealing with a world that has over 6 billion      people.<br />      <br />      You and others have objected to the President's statement      that "birds don't vote," comparing it to former President      Reagan's statement shat "if you've seen one redwood, you've      seen them all." That is a tragically mistaken analogy. The      President was acknowledging a political reality, not      expressing a philosophical preference. Truly, birds don't      vote-and in an overcrowded, chaotic world, if you      don't vote or have a sponsor who votes, your political      agendas are meaningless . . . . politics today is the      science of accommodating people, not peregrines; of humans,      not hummingbirds . . . .<br />      <br />      You all know of the many problems incurred in just trying      to feed America, the breadbasket of the world. But perhaps      you don't realize the current global farmland crisis. The      vast areas of prime farmland we once knew are now history.      Over 25 percent of the farmlands of 1980 are now devoid of      the topsoil essential for high-yield production, and we      have lost 5 billion acres to desertification. In addition,      the inexpert use of irrigation in the eighties and nineties      created salinity problems we still are unable to solve. Of      course, most farmland loss was incurred by simply trying to      house our exploding population. We as a planet wasted the      onetime inheritance of a foot of the best topsoil that God      ever gave anyone.<br />      <br />      Since 1980 we have added a population equivalent to 20      Bangladeshes to an already hungry world. We add 2.5 people      every second to a world already beyond its carrying      capacity. Eighty-eight percent of this growth occurred in      the Third World. When you sit down to dinner tonight, there      will be 50,000 more people to feed than when you got up      from breakfast. We cannot worry about quality of life when      we are worrying about quantity of existence . . . .<br />      <br />      Did [this administration] lose the People's Republic of      Mexico? I resent the insinuation. t agree we have an Iran      on our doorstep, but Mexico was lost long before we came      into office. Did you really think a democracy that had      corruption as a way of life, vast discrepancies between      rich and poor, and a birthrate that doubled the population      every 15 years would survive? It wasn't if the revolution      would take place-it was <em>when!</em> [This      administration] didn't loan them all that money. We learned      in the International Banking Crisis of 1986 that 300      million people in underdeveloped countries will not get up      and go to work each morning for the Chase Manhattan Bank.      The President consistently tried to stop those programs      when she was in the Senate. But we suffer the results . . .      .<br />      <br />      No one has forgotten the campaign of 1992-when the      "Forests or Families" debate was carried on. But try to      understand that my party neither had nor has anything      against national forests-we merely believe that      housing lot people is more important. We've had to build as      many housing units in the last 30 years as in the first 300      years of America's existence-and this required an      incredible amount of wood. The President, however, is      proposing an amendment to the recently passed Forest      Reduction Act. This bill is patterned after the old      Wilderness Act that was repealed in 1990-and will      exempt 5,000 acres in every state from harvesting. This      land will be administered by the Department of Leisure.      Your resolution criticizes me for requiring nature      enthusiasts to apply for permits to the remaining natural      forest areas . . . . I'd like to hear some praise for the      fact that we doubled the acres of urban parks in the nation      by taking down the headstones to cemeteries. We are      trying.<br />      <br />      Next, let me discuss the most controversial legislation now      pending before Congress-the compulsory birth control      amendment to the National Health Service Act.<br />      <br />      We can no longer tolerate the historic anachronism that the      number of children -a family has is strictly a private      decision carrying no social consequences. The individual      miracle of birth has become a collective tragedy . . .      .<br />      <br />      We think this law is clearly constitutional. If the law      says you can have only one wife, it can say you can have      only two children. This administration will give you the      maximum amount of human freedom we can-but our hands      are tied . . . . We must have more restriction . . .      .<br />      <br />      Speaking of rationing, another dark spot on the horizon is      the Water Rationing Act. We were hoping to increase your      allotment to two baths every week, but we have not had as      much success as we had hoped with our recycling programs.      Again, I resent being blamed for this conservation measure      . . . . Since the Great World Drought of 1992, brought      about by increasing global temperature, and since the      substantial contamination of so much of the remaining      water, our supply of fresh water has dropped dramatically      below the 1990 level while demand leas continued to      increase. We do what we have to do . . . .<br />      <br />      We do not have enough resources . . . for our own needs.      Tin and lead are virtually gone from the earth, and at      current rates of consumption-even under the National      Rationing Act-we only have enough sulfur to last nine      more years, copper to last 17 years, magnesium to last 44      years, and iron ore to last 70 years. We have picked the      earth bare in order to support our bloated world      population. The Ship of State is being dismantled to      support the crew. Wilderness, birds, and      single-family residences were fine in the 1960s when      we had only 200 million people, but today they are a luxury      we cannot afford . . . .<br />      <br />      The laissez-faire advocates heard, but did not heed,      prophets such as filbert Schweitzer, who said, "Man has      long lost his ability to foresee and forestall; he will end      by destroying the earth." Most unfortunately, the warnings      of these people were dismissed as groundless doom and gloom      . . . We didn't listen, and my hell-as Secretary of      the Interior-is seeing the truth too late. Don't      blame the President-blame our collective myopia.    </p>
