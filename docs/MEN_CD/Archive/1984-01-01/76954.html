        <p><em>In celebration of</em> <em>folks involved in MOTHER-type doings around the world.</em></p><p><strong>JIMMY LEE SUDDUTH:<br />PRIMITIVE ARTIST</strong></p><p>Since his childhood, Jimmy Lee Sudduth has had a love for art. But not until 12 years ago, when he retired from doing field work and odd jobs, was Jimmy able to devote his life to painting. Now, the 72-year-old Alabamian is praised as his state's most outstanding primitive artist.<br /><br />Sudduth looks to nature for the materials needed in his work. Clay mixed with water and sugar serves as his paint, and he uses more than 20 hues of the earthy substance . . . with shades ranging from rust and mustard to gray. Jimmy also derives needed colors from ivy, turnip greens, lilies, and walnut shells. Instead of the conventional paintbrush, he uses a stick or simply applies the paint with his fingers. And his "canvas" is far from ordinary: It might be a piece of plywood or tin, the back of a street sign, or an old door.<br /><br />By pursuing his lifelong dream, Sudduth has become the best-known citizen of Fayette County, Alabama. In 1976, he participated in the Festival of American Folklife, which was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution in commemoration of the nation's 200th birthday. Jimmy has also been the star of many art exhibits across the South, where he's repeatedly delighted observers with treasures created from the Alabama wild.- <em>Nancy Callahan</em>.<br /><br /><strong>SISTER JOAN CHITTISTER:</strong><br /><br />Joan Chittister is a Catholic nun and prioress of the Mt. St. Benedict complex in Erie, Pennsylvania. Members of the Benedictine order have traditionally been concerned with the preservation of the earth and the just distribution of resources, and Sister Joan believes that a good Benedictine should ask, "What does this planet need now?" Her <em>own</em> inquiry led to a decision to work toward energy conservation.<br /><br />Because of Sister Joan's efforts, a 2,700-foot gas well was drilled for Mt. St. Benedict in 1980, and natural gas now provides the priory with 55% to 60% of the fuel needed for heat, hot water, and cooking. But Chittister didn't stop there. In November of 1982, a three-bladed windplant was installed. The Benedictines' Director of Resource Development, Sister Pat Lupo, states that the unit-in its first winter of operation-supplied 80% of the electricity for the religious order's Glinodo Conference Center. Now, Sister Joan and her nuns are investigating solar energy.<br /><br />Since people are willing to go to war for oil, the sisters see the utilization of alternative energy sources as a contribution toward world peace. And the Erie Benedictines are happy to be "making good use of the things God has given us".- <em>DM.</em>.</p><p><strong>ROBERT OUTMAN:<br />BEAGLES AT WORK</strong></p><p>The beagle has traditionally been the hunter's helper . . . but Robert Outman is making use of the animal's acute senses to aid the homeowner. In 1979, the Belmont, California resident began training beagles to sniff out <em>termites</em>. Today he has 23 dogs working to detect the wood-chewing insects, which-according to a study conducted by Texas A & M University-do more than a billion dollars' worth of damage in the U.S. each year.<br /><br />The typical human termite inspector examines a building for evidence of damage, and listens for the insects while probing in sections of the structure that are suspected of being infested. But Robert's beagles, after a rigorous training program, are able to discover termites that would go unnoticed by the two-legged inspectors. The sensitive dogs can actually smell the insects and can also hear them munching away behind walls that appear to be sound. Because of the beagles' skill in pinpointing the pests, chemical fumigation of an entire home is often unnecessary . . . only the parts known to be affected need be treated.<br /><br />The beagle trainer believes that high technology is not necessarily synonymous with progress, and that overkill with chemicals is a step backward. As Outman puts it, "What better way to combat one of nature's most destructive elements than with a natural opponent?"- <em>Philip W.</em> <em>Leon</em>.</p><p><strong>IN BRIEF . . .</strong></p><p>Dr. ARNOLD BORER, visiting scientist at the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center in Lake Placid, New York, is doing research on the regenerative capacity of the earthworm. He'd like to integrate his findings into field studies that could be used to determine the toxicity, to earthworms and other soil organisms, of various agricultural chemicals (more than 8,000 of these substances are in use today). Dr. Borer-whose Ph.D. in General Physiology and Microbiology is complemented by many years of practical agricultural experience-hopes that his research will provide the knowledge people need in order to "keep our soil from becoming polluted to the degree our air and water are now".<br /><br />Dr. CHRISTOPHER HILLS, author and editor, is a leading proponent of the highly nutritious alga <em>Spirulina</em> (turn to page 180 of MOTHER NO. 68 for information on this remarkable food). In order to research, develop, and promote the healthful organism, Dr. Hills founded Microalgae International. Although the company is now the world's largest producer and distributor of <em>Spirulina</em>, Hills's prime objective is not personal financial gain. Rather, he is dedicated to creating global awareness of <em>Spirulina</em> as a means of fighting world hunger. Indeed, in one recent year, Christopher's company donated-through the Emergency Relief Fund International-$1.6 million worth of products to needy people in the U.S., India, Haiti, and El Salvador.<br /><br />The conservation society Friends of Nature presented its 1983 Conservation Award to DAN HEMENWAY of Orange, Massachusetts. Hemenway is a teacher and practitioner of permaculture-a productive, ecologically responsible system of food landscaping (see MOTHER NO. 77, page 82)-and is the editor of <em>The International Permaculture Seed Yearbook 1983.</em><br /><br />Last October, ZUBIN MEHTA conducted violinist ITZHAK PERLMAN and singers JESSYE NORMAN and KATHLEEN BATTLE in a classical concert sponsored by Musicians Against Nuclear Arms (MANA). More than 200 professional instrumentalists and vocalists-including members of the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera-participated in the program. Earl Kim, president of MANA, called the event "a musical statement of concern by musicians about the dangers of the nuclear arms race". Proceeds from the concert went to Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Nuclear Weapons Education Fund, both of which sponsor educational programs to increase awareness of nuclear weapons issues.- <em>DM</em>.</p>
