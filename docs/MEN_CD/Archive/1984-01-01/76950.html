                    <h3>      WATT WAS WRONG    </h3>    <p>      Secretary of the Interior James Watt, the Reagan      Administration's answer to comedian Don Rickles, finally      put his foot in his mouth once too often. As nearly      everyone knows, when Watt called his coal-leasing      commissioners "a black, a woman, two Jews, and a cripple",      Congress called for his resignation.<br />      <br />      Like an evil wind that leaves a trail of torn and troubled      landscape in its path, Hurricane Watt's legacy will be with      us for years to come. Long after his simplistic partisan      views and outrageous verbiage have faded from memory,      environmentalists-the people whom the Secretary      dubbed a "left-wing cult"-will still be working to      right Watt's wrongs.<br />      <br />      Under James Watt, federal lands were thrown open to      exploitation, auctioned off for development, or even      suggested as convenient dumping sites for toxic materials      and nuclear wastes. Some of the damage the man has wreaked      is irreversible . . . but other battles continue to      rage.<br />      <br />      Environmentalists' efforts to corral an oil and gas      drilling stampede in U.S. coastal waters is one struggle      that won't halt with Watt's departure. H.R. 3864 will, if      passed, protect the California and New England coasts from      drillers until the year 2000. And the continued wrestling      match over coal leasing-the issue that proved to be      the Secretary's undoing-has heightened public and      congressional interest in federal land-use practice.<br />      <br />      In April 1982, Watt tripped the alarms when he sold 1.6      <em>billion</em> tons of publicly owned coal in Montana and      Wyoming for only 3-1/2  cents per ton. At the time,      America's "real estate agent" bragged that he was about to      lease more coal in one year than had been let out in the      previous 62 years. This past September 20, however, the      Senate repudiated him by passing the Bumpers-Jackson      coal-leasing moratorium by a two-to-one margin. Typically,      the Secretary responded by accusing the Senate of lacking      the "resolve" to "defend freedom throughout the      world".<br />      <br />      No, James Watt will not be missed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WATT'S NEXT?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Columnist George Will offered what may prove to be the best      epitaph for the former Secretary of the Interior. "There      are only two things wrong with Jim Watt," Will cracked,      "his style and his substance." But while Watt is now out of      style in Washington, his substance remains.<br />      <br />      The successor to the Department of the Interior's top      chair, William Clark, originally promised "no change" in      the department's current policies. In addition, the      strongest qualification that Mr. Clark can claim is that      he's a rancher. (Need we mention that President Reagan owns      a ranch, too?) Still, lately he has been inviting critics      from environmental camps to drop by and talk things      over.<br />      <br />      Clearly, William Clark will bear close watching.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RUCKELSHAUS ARREST</strong>    </p>    <p>      A new face is certainly no guarantee of a new policy.      Remember when William Ruckleshaus was loudly applauded as      the white knight who would redeem the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) from the scandals of the Ann      Gorsuch-Burford/Rita Lavelle era? Following a cry of alarm      in July from the National Academy of Sciences that the acid      rain threat needed immediate attention, the new EPA      Director promised a plan of action by September. On October      24, Ruckleshaus made his announcement: The recommendations      were being put off "indefinitely". Whoops . . . the      administration that had promised the new director a "free      hand" in "cleaning up the EPA" had just decided to slap on      the handcuffs!    </p>    <p>      <strong>UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Taking a more active stance on the same issue, 50 people      from 40 U.S. and Canadian organizations met for four days      in Grand Portage, Minnesota in mid-September to form the      U.S. Acid Rain Network. Members include farmers, soil and      water conservationists, Native Americans,      environmentalists, and people from the fishing and tourism      industries. The network plans to issue Damage/Solution      Reports "adaptable to every region of the country" as well      as "a nice long list of jobs that individuals and      organizations can do to address the problem". For more      information, contact The North American Water Office,      1519-A East Franklin Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota      55404,612/872-1097.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIOXIN: A BURNING ISSUE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Though they may help rid city dumps of trash overloads,      municipal incinerators may also be filling city air with      deadly dioxins. This warning comes from EPA researcher Dr.      Michael Gross, who claims that urban trash burners may be      the second largest source of the deadly compound in the      nation. In one incinerator in Texas, for instance, Dr.      Gross found dioxin levels in fly ash that were 45 times      greater than the established EPA "safe" levels.<br />      <br />      Gross was forced to go public with his findings when the      information was censored from the EPA report he prepared.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NUKELY ERRORS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The year 1982 was a particularly busy one for paper pushers      in the nuclear power industry . . . because power plants      spent a lot of extra time reporting to the Nuclear      Regulatory Commission (NRC) on more than 4,500 safety      mishaps. Ten plants chalked up impressive scores of over      100 mishaps each. And 250 of the year's incidents were      called "particularly significant" events. (This description      refers to such "occurrences" as the near misses that could      have led to meltdowns at North Carolina's Brunswick 2 and      New York's Salem 2 power plants.) Half of the reported      problems were laid to equipment failure, 20% to design      flaws, and more than 25% to human error. Meanwhile, the      number of workers exposed to measurable amounts of      radiation in U.S. power plants jumped to 84,322 . . . a      113% increase over that for 1969. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: It      should be pointed out, however, that-according to the      DOE's Monthly Energy Review-electrical production      from nuclear power increased more than 200% during the same      period.]</em><br />      <br />      <strong>HOT COUTURE</strong><br />      <br />      With a short announcement in the <em>Federal Register,</em>      the NRC recently shut the lid on importation of      cloisonné jewelry. It seems the agency has found      that uranium salts traditionally used to color the enameled      adornments could expose wearers to as much as 4,000      millirems of radiation annually. The result, the NRC      calculated, could be two million cases of skin cancer each      year!<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, though, while uranium-enriched jewelry is      now unimportable, <em>tho</em> <em>rium</em> -bearing      cloisonné isn't affected by the ruling . . . nor are      the hot-uranium adornments already in use in this country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ORGANIC FARMING BLOCKED</strong>    </p>    <p>      The laudable Agricultural Productivity Act (H.R. 2714 and      S. 1128) that we've reported on in previous issues of      MOTHER has fallen on hard times. Secretary of Agriculture      Block's department continues to stonewall attempts to      encourage the pesticide-free farming the bill advocates.      The so-called "Organic Farming Act" would establish pilot      research programs on organic agricultural practices and has      received strong bipartisan backing in both houses of      Congress. (The bill currently has 65 sponsors in the House      and 16 Senate backers.) In fact, the <em>only</em>      opposition seems to come from the department Block      heads!<br />      <br />      Congressman James Weaver, angered by what he called      "zealous efforts to defeat" the bill, wrote Block a letter      complaining that "the USDA's determined opposition to the      Agricultural Productivity Act is both shocking and      confusing". An avalanche of letters to the President and      members of Congress could help break the Reagan      Administration's "Blockade".    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The worldwide organization called Friends of      the Earth is one of the most effective environmental groups      in existence today, and the activities of FOE-along      with a broad range of other news concerning ecological      developments-are described each month in its      publication titled Not Man Apart.
