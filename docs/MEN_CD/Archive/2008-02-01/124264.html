        <p>I live in Texas where most of our soil is a heavy black gumbo, but I’ve learned a way to raise potatoes so they don’t rot before harvest time.</p><p>I have a raised bed of black soil, compost, manure and autumn leaves, which decompose over the winter. I till the bed about 10 to 12 inches down and plant my seed potatoes on top of the ground. Then, I place a 2-foot high tomato cage over the potatoes and put hay in the cage until it reaches the top. I add a 1-pound coffee can of soil on top of the hay and water it thoroughly. This compresses the hay, so I add more to bring the hay level up to the top of the cage.</p><p>During the growing season the plants do need to be watered, but this system retains the water.</p><p>The potato plants eventually grow out of the top of the hay and trail over the side of the cage. At the end of the season, I get a good harvest of potatoes without fear of their having rotted.</p><h5>LaVonne Nowlin<br />Fort Worth, Texas</h5><p></p><hr />
