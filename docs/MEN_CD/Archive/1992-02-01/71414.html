                <p><strong>      MOTHER'S KITCHEN    </strong></p>        <p>      <strong>Stews and Chilies to Chase the Chills</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Mary Karenou    </h5>        <p>      Stews and chilies have always been a favorite in my family.      While none of the men have ever expended any real time or      energy in the kitchen (raiding the fridge at 3 a.m.      notwithstanding), all seem to have a good recipe up their      sleeves.    </p>    <p>      And with good reason. What better on a cold day that a      steaming pot of flavorful meat, fresh vegetables, and a      rich stock that melds like slow-simmered gravy. Ladled over      rice or noodles, stews and chilies are hearty fillers that      require minimal time and effort.    </p>    <p>      When my father and his wife came to visit recently, I threw      on a pot of my chili (I say "my" with some significance, as      every chili served in our family has many variations,      depending who stocked the pot) in the morning and left it      to simmer while we spent the afternoon skating on the pond.    </p>    <p>      Chilies and stews stand on their own, with such a      commanding presence that it takes only a hearty starch to      make a full meal. (I used to serve a green salad with my      stews and chilies for Sunday supper-only to realize,      four or five times into this routine, that my lovely greens      sat mostly untouched.)    </p>    <p>      So grab your biggest pot, dash to the root cellar, and      throw a loaf into the oven. Then head outside and sled down      the hill while dinner slow-cooks to simmered perfection.    </p>    <h3>      My Chili    </h3>    <p>      <em>4 cups water<br />      3 8-ounce cans tomato sauce<br />      2 5-ounce cans tomato paste<br />      2 cups chopped onions<br />      1 cup chopped celery<br />      2 tablespoons chili powder<br />      2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br />      1 tablespoon sugar<br />      2 bay leaves<br />      4 minced garlic cloves<br />      2 teaspoons cinnamon<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1 teaspoon black pepper<br />      1 teaspoon ground cumin<br />      1/2 teaspoon ground allspice<br />      1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br />      2 pounds ground beef<br />      4 cups kidney beans Toppings: grated cheddar cheese chopped      onion sour cream saltines</em>    </p>    <p>      In a stockpot, combine all of the ingredients except the      ground beef and the beans. Cover and bring to a boil. In a      frying pan, brown the beef and crumble with a spatula.    </p>    <p>      Drain off the fat and add the meat to the stockpot. Bring      to a boil again. Add the beans and bring to a boil once      more. Then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours. Discard      the bay leaves. Ladle into shallow soup bowls.    </p>    <p>      Pass the cheese, onions, sour cream, and saltines. (Proper      layering order of toppings in our family was always cheese,      onion, sour cream, with crumbled saltines over each      individual file or, as I used to do when I was a      kid-requiring more patience than it's      worth-piling a bite of chili onto each saltine).      Serves 8 generously.    </p>    <h3>      Grandfather's Beef and Vegetable Stew    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons olive oil<br />      6 thick slices of farmer's bacon<br />      2 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes<br />      Freshly ground black pepper<br />      10 small leeks (white half with a bit of green), well      rinsed<br />      6 carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch lengths<br />      2 cups green beans, ends trimmed and snapped in half<br />      6 parsnips, peeled and cut into 3-inch lengths<br />      2 tablespoons sugar<br />      11/2 cups beef stock, homemade or canned<br />      11/2 cups of table-quality Burgundy<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      2 tablespoons red currant jelly<br />      2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves, crumbled<br />      8 small red new potatoes, halved<br />      6 minced garlic cloves<br />      6 ripe plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped<br />      1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the olive oil in a      large skillet. Add the bacon, and cook over medium heat      until fat is rendered, 4-5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon,      transfer the bacon to a heavy flameproof casserole. Brown      the beef in the same skillet, in small batches, over      medium-high heat. Sprinkle the beef with pepper as it is      cooking. Transfer the beef to the casserole with the bacon.    </p>    <p>      Place the leeks, carrots, green beans, and parsnips in the      same skillet. Sprinkle with the sugar and sauté over      medium heat to caramelize them slightly, 6-8 minutes.      Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside.    </p>    <p>      Add the stock and wine to the skillet and bring to a boil,      scraping down any brown bits. Swirl in the butter, red      currant jelly, and thyme. Cook for 1 minute, then pour over      the meat in the casserole and bring the mixture to boil.      Cover, transfer to the oven, and bake for 45 minutes.<br />      Remove the casserole from the oven and add the reserved      vegetables. Add the tomatoes and all but one tablespoon of      the parsley. Stir gently, adjust the seasonings, and return      the casserole to the oven. Bake uncovered until the beef is      tender, 45 minutes. Garnish with the remaining 1 tablespoon      parsley, and serve. Makes 6 portions.    </p>    <h3>      Uncle Bill's Texas Chili    </h3>    <p>      <em>3 pounds ground beef<br />      3 pounds cubed round steak<br />      2 28-ounce cans stewed tomatoes<br />      1 large can V-8<br />      2 11/2-ounce boxes onion soup mix<br />      1 large Spanish onion, chopped<br />      3 stalks celery, chopped<br />      2 green peppers, chopped<br />      1/2 cup white vinegar<br />      2 cloves garlic, crushed<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      3 ounces chili powder<br />      1/4 cup barbecue sauce<br />      1/4 cup catsup<br />      4 tablespoon Tabasco sauce<br />      2 teaspoons cumin powder<br />      2 teaspoon instant bullion cubes<br />      2 teaspoon salt<br />      1 teaspoon oregano<br />      1/2 teaspoon paprika<br />      1/2 teaspoon black pepper<br />      1 cup red pepper, chopped<br />      1 cup beer<br />      1/2 cup medium-hot salsa</em>    </p>    <p>      Brown beef and sauté onions and peppers. Put in a      large, ovenproof cooking pot and place in a preheated      300°F oven. Heat for 3 or 4 hours and stir occasionally      until desired thickness is reached. Makes 6 quarts.    </p>    <h3>      Dad's Fast Chili    </h3>    <p>      <em>Canola oil<br />      3 onions, chopped<br />      3 green peppers, chopped<br />      3 cloves minced garlic<br />      1/2 pound hamburger<br />      2 1-pound cans stewed tomatoes, undrained<br />      1 6-ounce can tomato paste<br />      2 teaspoons chili powder<br />      2 bay leaves<br />      1 teaspoon cumin<br />      1 teaspoon basil pinch of cayenne kidney beans to      taste</em>    </p>    <p>      In 1/2" of canola oft, sauté onions, green peppers,      and garlic until soft and reserve. Brown the meat and      drain. In a stockpot, add all remaining ingredients and      stir. Add meat and vegetables. Simmer for 30 minutes, then      add kidney beans to taste. Cook long enough for beans to be      heated through, 20 minutes. Serve with raw onions and      saltines.    </p>    <h3>      Cousin Bruce's Gobbler's Chili    </h3>    <p>      <em>11/4 pound coarse ground chuck<br />      11/4 pound pork, cut into 1/4" cubes<br />      1/2 pound ground turkey<br />      1 15-ounce can tomato sauce<br />      1 15-ounce can heavy tomato paste<br />      2 large red onions, chopped<br />      5 cloves garlic, chopped<br />      1 green pepper, chopped<br />      1 4-ounce can of green chilies, diced<br />      1 can beer<br />      1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce<br />      1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br />      1 jigger tequila<br />      3 tablespoon chili powder<br />      1 tablespoon ground cumin<br />      1 teaspoon ground oregano<br />      1 tablespoon salt<br />      2 teaspoon paprika<br />      1 ounce of baking chocolate<br />      1 cup shredded jack cheese</em>    </p>    <p>      Brown beef, pork, and turkey in 1/4 cup of bacon grease or      oil. Add to a stockpot. Stir in the tomato sauce, stir, and      simmer on low heat. Sauté onions, red pepper, and      garlic until tender (do not brown), then add to the pot      along with diced green chilies. Place beer in a separate      bowl and add Tabasco, Worcestershire, tequila, chili      powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and paprika. Stir until      smooth and add to pot, mixing well. Add the baking      chocolate and stir in when melted. Simmer 2 to 3 hours.      Before serving, stir in the jack cheese.    </p>
