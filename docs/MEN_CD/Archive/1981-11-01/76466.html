            			<p>     <h1 id="title">Ecoscience</h1>		 </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne and Paul Ehrlich    </h5>    <h3>      Conservatives and Conservation    </h3>        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sri ences. Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population", "resources", and "environment" in      the late 1960's. (They also coined the term</em>      coevolution, <em>and did a lot to make</em> ecology <em>the      household word it is today.) But while most folks are aware      of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the areas of ecology      and overpopulation (most of us-for instancehave read Paul's      book</em> The Population Bomb) . . . far <em>too few people      have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in      ecological research (research of the type that tends to be      published only in technical journals and college      textbooks.) That's why it pleases us to be able to      present-on a regular basis-the following      semi-technical column by authors/ecologists/educators Anne      and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <p>      Conservationists across America were shocked, recently, to      learn that Secretary of the Interior James Watt sees little      reason to worry about preserving the land and resources of      the United States for our descendants. As he explained to      the Interior Committee of the House of Representatives, "I      do not know how many future generations we can count on      before the Lord returns."    </p>    <p>      James Watt is a brand-new kind of Interior Department      head . . . a man who seems to believe that God has given      him marching orders to turn over as much of our public land      as possible to private exploitation. This calling, however,      is not merely a result of his appointment. For four years      <em>before</em> taking office, Watt was president of a gang      of environmental rapists, centered in Denver, called the      Mountain States Legal Foundation. In that role, he crusaded      in favor of unregulated strip mining, and other policies      that would contribute to the spread of overgrazing and air      pollution.    </p>    <p>      Watt's viewpoint (one that's apparently shared by many      other wealthy and powerful westerners) appears to be that      God originally gave the lands of the United States to an      assortment of large corporations . . . the Indians then      stole that territory from big business . . . after which      the federal government stole it from the Indians. The goal      of Watt and other so-called "sagebrush rebels", then, is to      return the land to its "rightful" owners.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUREAUCRATIC EXPLOITATION</strong>    </p>        <p>      To anyone familiar with the present state of western lands,      Watt's crusade would be funny if it weren't so dangerous.      One must <em>search</em> in the mountain ranges of Nevada,      for instance, to discover public domain that hasn't already      been overgrazed. Worse yet, with the help of the antiquated      mining law of 1872, companies are literally chopping down      the mountains themselves. Everywhere the effects of the      Forest Service's "Land of Many Abuses" policies are marring      the environment.    </p>    <p>      When dedicated public servants have attempted to halt such      plundering of public property, pressure from powerful      economic interests has usually gotten those individuals      transferred. In fact, long before Watt took over, the      morale of the federal employees who would like to conserve      something for future generations had begun to deteriorate,      and more and more bureaucrats had started to cooperate with      the exploiters.    </p>    <p>      Thus, at a time when the country needs a      <em>conservative</em> Secretary of the Interior (an      individual who controls nearly a million square miles of      our country), it has, instead, an apparent <em>radical</em>      who seems bent on destroying his public trust for private      profit. Watt's push for more uncontrolled commercial      development of public lands has already angered true      conservatives throughout the West.    </p>    <p>      However, most <em>ecologists</em> are more than angry at      Watt . . . they are actively afraid of him. They know that      there is all too little time to reverse the tide of habitat      destruction and extinction that threaten the survival of      our society (see "The Snail Darter and Us" in MOTHER NO.      57, page 128, and "Extinction: It Should Concern Us All!"      in No. 68, page 154). They've seen Watt stop the      acquisition of new national parkland (when it's badly      needed) and concentrate on "improving" existing parks      (which seems to mean expanding their facilities for people,      thus degrading their capacity to support <em>other</em>      species). Ecologists have also watched him remove the      conservationists from the U.S. delegation to the latest      meeting of the Convention on International Trade in      Endangered Species, while supporting policies that could      force numerous species of parrots to extinction. In his      television appearances, Watt gibbers on about how he's      making all such changes "for the people". He's apparently      utterly oblivious to the fact that his actions could      threaten the lives of future generations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>REAGAN RADICALISM</strong>    </p>    <p>      Of course, one highly placed ecological ignoramus doesn't      make an administration. Could it be that Ronald Reagan just      listened to bad advice in appointing his Secretary of the      Interior? If the Sierra Club gets millions of signatures on      its "dump Watt" petition, is there any chance that the      President will remove him and find a true conservative as a      replacement?    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, that scenario seems unlikely. Radicalism has      been the theme of all of Reagan's environmental actions.      The Council of Environmental Quality, the ecological      conscience of the executive branch, has been gutted. Reagan      appointed another Colorado antienvironmentalist, Anne      Gorsuch, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. (John      B. Oakes, former senior editor of the <em>New York      Tines,</em> wrote that she has "no discernible      qualifications for her highly technical post".)    </p>    <p>      Reagan also made Colorado cattleman Robert T. Buford chief      of the Bureau of Land Management, which already permits      extensive overgrazing of federal rangeland. A foe of      stripmining regulations, Indianan James Harris, has become      head of the Office of Surface Mining. And a former attorney      for a timber company, John Crowell, got the nod as      Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in charge of national      forests!    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, both presidential counselor Edwin Meese (in      April) and Vice President Bush (in June) have stated      publicly that Watt is doing the President's bidding. And      Reagan's exploitative attitude toward our natural heritage,      which is that environmental quality is a luxury that must      not stand in the way of economic progress, is shared by all      too many politicians, business people, and plain citizens.      Environmental controls, such individuals claim, have been a      burden on business and must be relaxed so that a more      "balanced" approach can be taken.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Of course, there's no way that Reagan can truly claim to be      choosing economics over ecology, even though he clearly      doesn't know that. The world simply isn't made that way.      The immediate costs of America's limited environmental      regulations have been small . . . making a trivial      contribution to inflation, for example. And if the      accounting were done correctly-so that the      calculations included the economic options preserved, the      health costs avoided, and the lives saved-the      regulations would doubtless prove to have been extremely      profitable.    </p>    <p>      But the real costs of the Reagan-Watt radical      environmental policy will be paid largely in the future,      under different administrations. The basic question is      what, if anything, can be done to keep those costs from      becoming more than our descendants can pay.    </p>    <p>      The sad truth is that we have traded in a politically inept      President who understood many of the world's problems for      an extremely able politician who understands almost none of      them. But President Reagan is no fool . . . so perhaps he      can be educated. Under his charismatic leadership, this      administration could create an environmental record that      would bring the praises of future generations, rather than      their curses.    </p>    <p>      If Reagan shows no sign of learning, however,      environmentalists must organize against him politically . .      . and soon! The fate of our nation cannot then be left in      his hands, no matter how well-meaning he may be.    </p>    <p>      <em>The reasons that the initiation of ecologically sound      land stewardship policies is essential now are detailed      in</em> Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the      Disappearance of Species by <em>Paul and Anne Ehrlich      (Random House, 1981, $15.95).
