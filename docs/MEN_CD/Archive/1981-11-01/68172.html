        <p><strong>Over 250 of our local groups have already gotten off the ground!</strong></p><p>Over a year ago, we announced plans to set up a national network of chapters for MOTHER'S subscribers. As we saw it, the system of locally based groups would help people of similar tastes and interests share their dreams and ideas, exchange information, barter goods and services, and-in short-help one another live more self-reliant lifestyles.</p><p>We're now pleased to announce that-thanks to the fine efforts of our volunteer organizers-more than 250 "getting to know you" get-togethers have been held across the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii, and Canada. Most of these initial meetings had between 25 and 30 people in attendance . . . several drew over 50 . . . and one session-the current recordholder-counted 200-plus participants!</p><p>Many of our fledgling groups have discovered that the best first step in founding a chapter is to help members become acquainted. A successful introductory meeting, then, will break the ice by drawing out information about the occupations, skills, and talents that each individual brings to the group, and by stimulating discussion of the goals that members hope they-and the chapter-will accomplish. A good kickoff affair should be fun as well: Indeed, in many areas covered dish suppers and folk or country music shindigs have turned out to be especially good ways to start the ball rolling.</p><p>We're also beginning to get feedback n some chapters' <em>ongoing</em> activities.</p><p>One, for instance, has already held a workshop to teach its members how to build solar collectors . . . another showed its "spirit" by holding a session on how to brew homemade beer! Other initial projects have included building solar food dryers, greenhouses, water heaters, and collectors . . . working out barter exchanges . . . and gathering firewood.</p><p>A number of groups have set up "living libraries" to cross-reference the skills and talents of their members. That way, a "chapterite" who needs specific information or assistance can easily identify the fellow member with the most knowledge or experience in that particular field.</p><p>Several chapters are printing community barter information, and a few have actually started their own newsletters. (And we thought <em>The Community Spirit</em> was unique!) And that's still not all. Other groups are using their collective powers for co-op buying, staging exhibits at state and energy fairs, and sponsoring bake and rummage sales to raise money for operating costs or membership dues.</p><p><strong>LEARNING AS YOU GO</strong></p><p>Sometimes a worthwhile meeting has focused on an interesting lecture or tour. The Piedmont, Alabama chapter, for example, inspected the Rocky Hollow Energy System (see MOTHER NO. 64, page 100), which-for about $15 a month-supplies all Bill and Pat Megnin's electricity. Presentations have included a lec ture on fall and winter gardening by a local county extension agent and a neighboring chimney sweep's talk on woodstove installation and safety.</p><p>In the meantime, MOTHER herself has been busy preparing video how-to cassettes for the chapters' use. At the moment we have finished tapes about beekeeping and cordwood construction. We also have slide presentations in the works on alcohol fuel production and lowcost solar systems (they should be completed by the end of the year). And there's more to come!</p><p><strong>BUSINESS BITS</strong></p><p>Some readers have written to inquire what happens to the $15 that MOTHER assesses each person who becomes a member of our national chapters organization (local dues are established and handled by each local group). Well, for those of you who may be wondering, the national dues help to cover our chapter organizing expenses, as well as the cost of developing member-oriented instructional materials and tapes. The fees also pay for the publication of <em>The Community Spirit . . . the</em> bimonthly newsletter that goes out to all chapter members. bringing them the how-to of seasonal projects ... information about discounted books and plans . . low-cost classified ads . . . a free barter exchange column . . . nutritional news . . . reports on chapter activities nationwide . . . and a variety of articles on the same kind of down-to-earth topics that appear in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .</p><p>A few other folks have expressed some concern over coping with the <em>legalities</em> that go hand in hand with the development of any organization. Fortunately, we've drafted Articles of Association and Bylaws to help you get through the business of incorporating ... so you can move on to your group's intended activities. Such paperwork is all too necessary to protect individual members (as well as the good name of MOTHER herself) and to give the local organizations greater autonomy, but we've tried our best to keep the red tape to a minimum. So far, 25 groups have finished up their legal work and become bona fide Mother's Chapters . . . and most members of these said that the paperwork was certainly worthwhile and proved to be less bother than they'd expected.</p><p><strong>IT'S UP TO YOU!</strong></p><p>If you like what you've read about Mother's Chapters but live in an area that doesn't yet have one of its own, why not take the initiative to start a group yourself? After all, MOM'S chapters are meant for you . . . so they're only going to be what you-and folks like you-decide to make them!</p>
