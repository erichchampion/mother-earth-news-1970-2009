                <p>      In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of humankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced      our stillstanding offer: Anyone (and that means you!) who      sends us a short (about 300 words) account of an actual      barter that's good enough to print will receive-as      the folks on the following page have-a twelve-month      subscription (or extension of same) to THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS (restricted) .    </p>        <p>		<strong>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Inc., P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791</strong>    </p>    <p>      When travelers from the West visit Ahmednagar, India on      their way to Avatar Meher Baba's tomb, they frequently      bring along reading materials      and-inevitably-some such folks end up leaving      books behind. Rather than let the volumes simply collect      dust, or-worse yet-be lost or destroyed, a      group of us living in the area decided to gather the      discards . . . and we soon formed a small library.    </p>    <p>      However, it wasn't long before our athenaeum owned three      copies of Tolkien's Middle Earth trilogy and five volumes      of <em>Watership Down . . . as</em> well as surplus copies      of other popular books. The duplicates were of little use      to our library, and it was evident that-if they      <em>continued</em> to accumulate-there would soon be      no available shelf space for <em>new</em> titles.    </p>    <p>      Well, a bit of old-time bartering solved our literary      predicament. In the nearby village there's an English      bookstore that carries the latest best sellers. We arranged      to trade our duplicates (often in mint condition) for      credit toward new volumes of our choosing. The swap has now      been going strong for <em>three years,</em> and it's been      so successful that the shop has opened an entire used-book      section, so that <em>other</em> folks in the area can trade      in their reading materials, too!    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, since foreign <em>magazines</em> are very      expensive here, our newspaper deliverer has devised a      system by which, for a monthly fee of $1.20, he'll      circulate periodicals to his subscribers every day. I      contribute my old copies of such publications . . . and      receive a <em>fret,</em> daily newspaper in return. (My      back issues of MOTHER are <em>not</em> part of this      roundrobin arrangement, however . . . those I keep!)    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>D. F.<br />      Ahmednagar, India</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      A couple of years back, when we moved up here to the Badger      State, my husband and I were glad to discover that six      prolific apple trees and a stored-in-the-basement grape      press were part of our homestead purchase package.      And-as you can well imagine-when bushels of      tart red beauties started dotting the limbs of the trees in      our miniature orchard, we yearned for an apple press which      would allow us to produce some sweet cider. Our depleted      savings, however, couldn't quite cope with the cost of a      fruit squeezer.    </p>    <p>      This past autumn found us still pretty barren of surplus      cash, but we <em>had</em> located a reasonably priced cider      press <em>kit.</em> Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I      felt capable of handling the carpentry involved in      constructing the do-it-yourself apple crusher, but one of      our friends-an excellent carpenter by trade and an      avid winemaker in his spare time-came to our rescue      by proposing a deal: He'd share his woodworking      know-how in exchange for our inherited grape press.    </p>    <p>      The trading didn't end there, either. During the fail we      were given freezer space (for storing frozen apple cider      concentrate) in exchange for picking rights in our orchard      . . . and photographs of our children, jars of honey, and a      chicken dinner were ours in return for bottles of the sweet      homemade squeezings.    </p>    <p>      Now the apple season is coming to a close, but we'll long      treasure the goodies, and new friendships, that were      generated by our autumn cider-swapping deals.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>L.R.<br />      Wisconsin</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Last spring, after my family had spent the winter coaxing      our Jeep pickup up and down the glorified creekbed that      serves as our driveway, the runabout was in dire need of a      thorough tune-up. Fortunately, when the cold northern winds      were finally beginning to depart from our region, I met a      couple who'd recently Invested in an auto clinic franchise.      And during the course of my conversation with the      entrepreneurs, I discovered that they knew very little      about advertising . . . the profession that had been my      livelihood for many years.    </p>    <p>      Well, I've <em>always</em> had a bent toward barter, so I      immediately suggested an even swap: a tune-up of our      overworked vehicle in exchange for a promotional plan for      their fledgling business.    </p>    <p>      The trade has been even more of a success than we expected!      Our rejuvenated Jeep purred contentedly along the      stream-bottom road all summer long . . . and our new-found      friends' enterprise has prospered, with the help of a      sixmonth advertising campaign. But-best of all-the      deal hasn't ended. When the family pickup required another      engine adjustment in early autumn, the auto clinic was due      for its second advertising planning session . . . and we've      already arranged for a similar barter again next spring!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>C.S.<br />      Tennessee</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Firewood prices-in our suburban tocale-are soaring, but so      far I haven't had to buy a single log. By using a bit of      old-time bartering sense, I've been able to fill the      woodbox and keep my bank account out of the red.    </p>    <p>      While commuting to college classes throughout the summer,      you see, I kept a lookout-especially after windstormsfor      downed limbs and fallen trees. Upon spying a possible      bonanza, I'd leave a note in the door of the residence . .      . giving my name, my telephone number, and an offer to haul      away the woody nuisance. Then, on my way home from class,      I'd call on the "customer" and-usually-clinch      the deal. (If no one was home, I'd get the owner's name      from the mailbox or a neighbor, and telephone later. In      some cases the householder might even contact me.)    </p>    <p>      Most folks appreciate the prompt removal of unsightly brush      or trees . . . and-as a result of swapping my      serviceI'm stocked up on fuel for the winter months!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>S.I.<br />      Pennsylvania</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Barter is alive and well, I'm glad to report, even in the      heart of what some folks might consider the cash capital of      the world: New York City. As a matter of fact-despite      our hometown's moneyoriented atmosphere-our family of      three meets the basic needs of food and shelter by relying      almost entirely on swapping!    </p>    <p>      In exchange for "free" rent, for example, I spend a few      hours each week showing potential tenants the vacant suites      in our apartment building. My part of the deal also      includes keeping an eye on the brownstone's maintenance to      make sure all the services are running smoothly.    </p>    <p>      Our groceries are provided for by a similar setup. During      the week I volunteer a couple of my leisure hours at a      nearby natural foods restaurant, preparing meals as payment      for a daily "homecooked" dinner for my family. Moreover,      I'm able to use the eatery's kitchen facilities to bake      pies, cookies, and bread . . . which I then trade to a      store down the block for such staple items as rice, beans,      eggs, and tofu.    </p>    <p>      In fact, my goodies (many of the recipes for which came      straight out of MOTHER) have become so popular at that      shop's checkout counter that word of our swap has spread:      The local movie house now sells my delicacies at its      concession stand, while our family enjoys a cost-free film      each week . . . and a classical repertory theater waives      our admission fees in return for a steady supply of my      baked goods!    </p>    <p>      In short, I've found that food and labor are among the best      of trading items . . . and I feel I'm just beginning to      discover the possibilities!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>S.P.<br />      New York</strong></em>    </p>
