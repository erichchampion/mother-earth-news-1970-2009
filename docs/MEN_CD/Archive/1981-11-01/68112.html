                <p>      <strong>Here are 15 no-cost ways to find out more about the      foods you eat.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Jean Stangl</strong>    </p>    <p>      More and more folks are becoming concerned about the amount      of sugar, additives, and calories found in the foods they      commonly buy and eat. Such men and women are also      interested in learning about the vitamin content of natural      foods. Unfortunately, it's sometimes necessary to seek help      in deciphering the often complex nutritional labels used on      food packages today.    </p>    <p>      Well, what follows is a mere sampling of the numerous      publications that offer helpful information about      nutrition. What's more, the booklets listed below are all      free for the asking . . . subject, of course, to the      quantity available and the number of requests, so-if      any of them interest you-get your order in early.      Just drop a postcard to each firm or agency whose title(s)      you'd like to receive, stating your choice and giving your      name and address. It's that simple. (Be sure, however, to      allow two to four weeks for your information to arrive.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>NUTRITION: FOOD AT WORK</strong> <strong>FOR      YOU</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>A DAILY FOOD GUIDE</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Prudential Insurance Company<br />      of America Dept.
