                <p>      <strong>This ingenious solar adobe dwelling is "Home, Warm      Home" even in -15° weather!</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Bill and Wanda Colyer</strong>    </p>    <p>      My wife and I had several goals in mind when we set out to      design and build our own home. We hoped to create an      energy-conserving farmhouse that used both conventional      building supplies <em>and</em> readily available native      materials. Furthermore, we wanted our abode to employ only      the renewable energy sources of sunlight and firewood for      heating, yet at the same time-we planned to keep      temperature fluctuations to a minimum.    </p>    <p>      Well, after a lot of planning, replan ning <em>, and</em>      trial-and-error building, our "Sun Blest" home is complete      . . . and it's a grand success. The northern New Mexico      house (we live three miles west of Taos) has kept us warm      during the -15°F cold spells that annually hit our      farming area . . . and helps cool our family during the hot      days of summer as well!    </p>    <p>      <strong>BLEST BE THE SUN THAT SHINES</strong>    </p>        <p>      As you can see in the accompanying photo, the entire second      floor of our long and lean (69'7" X 23'3") dwelling is      covered by a huge south-facing window. In the center of the      house, any light passing through this double layered      Kalwall Sunlite reinforced polyester glazing goes directly      to the second-floor balcony and below-through a large open      space-to our living-room/greenhouse area. At both ends of      the building, however, admitted sunshine hits a series of      simple solar collectors (constructed of insulated sheet      steel that has been covered with 3-M's Nextel Velvet      Coating 101-C10), which are separated from the two upstairs      bedrooms by wooden inner walls (see Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      All the sun-warmed air-including that heated in the home's      center space and by our seven 4' X 8' collectors-rises, by      convection, to the home's attic. From there, it's pulled      down to the ground floor by a four-speed blower, and routed      through ductwork either to the rock heatstorage bin      constructed beneath the ground floor or-if we need      immediate warming-through an open subfloor to the      entire perimeter of the home (see Fig. 1). Either way, the      air eventually circulates back to the attic by way of the      inside walls of the house.    </p>        <p>      The blower can easily route the air in a complete circuit      several times in one hour, but-since the below-floor      passageways distribute the moving air all around the inside      borders of the house-we never notice the "spread thin"      breeze. In addition, as the rising currents pass along our      ground-floor adobe walls, the excellent thermal energy      storage material absorbs more of the circulating heat . . .      and gradually radiates the warmth into the living area. We      further improved the heat-storing capabilities of our      first-floor walls by putting inch-thick urethane slab      insulation between the inner and outer adobe brick layers.      (Incidentally, the walls were constructed by the CINVA Ram      process described in MOTHER NO. 39! )    </p>    <p>      Outside the front of the house, we erected a high      "slattice" of 2 X 6 lumber, as shown in the photo. The      cross sections of this wooden gridwork were angled so as to      block out summer sunlight while leaving openings for      snow-which otherwise might accumulate and eventually break      the overhang-to fall through. We also added some      short pieces of rightangled metal on the underside of the      slattice. These "drip lips" interrupt the flow of rain or      melted snow on the overhang and keep the runoff from      pouring onto the house.    </p>        <p>      Although our home's solar heating system can keep the main      building's 1,800 square feet warm during most cold weather      (especially since we cover the center windows with      reflective aluminized-mylar roll blinds at dusk), we do      need to supplement the sun-given heat with wood energy      whenever the nights drop below 0°F or following several      consecutive cloudy winter days. In anticipation of such      times, we built a 520-square-foot garage/workshop at the      back of the house . . . and equipped the room with a      Riteway 37 woodburning stove. We also placed black      sheetmetal plates 1-1/2 inches away from the sides of this      heat-Air warmed in the space between these convection      plates and the wood stove rises along the garage's slanted      roof and runs through an open damper into the second-floor      blower room. From there, It's circulated through the house.    </p>    <p>      The Sun Blest House incorporates some other energy-saving      features, as well. For example, we installed three fin      covered tubular heat exchangers (obtained as inexpensive      industrial surplus) in the attic. The cold water from our      well is routed through these heat absorbers for prewarming      before it goes to our standard electric water heater.    </p>    <p>      Finally, the blower and rock storage system can be used to      circulate and store cool air (admitted through a back north      vent) during summer nights . . . and thus helps "air      condition" our abode in the hot months.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KEEP ON THE SUNNY SIDE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Solar energy alone keeps the temperature in the Sun Blest      House from varying more than 15° (between 60° and      75°F) during most winter weather. And when a truly      severe cold spell hits-such as one entire week last year      when the days were cloudy and the nighttime temperature      plunged to -20°F-the backup woodburner keeps our living      quarters very comfortable. Our dwelling's heat is quite      inexpensive, too: We've calculated that the blower uses      about $8.00 of electricity a month during the cold season,      while the woodstove consumes some three cords of fuel a      year.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, while it's satisfying our heating needs, the      house-with its open, well-lighted living-room area,      circular stairway, and indoor greenhouse-meets our      aesthetic needs as well. The building did cost over $25 per      square foot in 1976 (including the garage/ workshop),      but-considering the fact that it's large, attractive,      comfortable, and <em>extremely</em> economical to      heat-we think we got ourselves areal "sun blest"      bargain!    </p>
