        <p>Using United States petroleum deliveries as a measure of oil demand, the <a title="American Petroleum Institute" href="http://www.api.org/" target="_blank">American Petroleum Institute</a> found that demand dropped by 1.2 million barrels per day to 19.4 million barrels per day in 2008, which is a 6 percent drop.</p><p>Oil demand fell because the demand for fuels dropped, with gasoline deliveries sliding by 3.3 percent, distillate fuel oil deliveries - which include diesel fuel - decreasing by 5.8 percent, jet fuel deliveries dropping by 6.1 percent, and residual fuel oil deliveries falling by 14 percent.</p><p>Coincidentally, United States crude oil production was also down, as lower oil production in Alaska and hurricane-related shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico pushed production below 5 million barrels per day for the first time since 1946.</p><p>Despite the drop in production, the imports of crude oil and petroleum products also decreased by more than 5 percent to 12.9 million barrels per day, the lowest level in five years.</p><p>Production of one petroleum product increased in the United States, however: The refinery output of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel increased by more than 10 percent to 3.1 million barrels per day.</p><p></p><hr /><h5>Reprinted from <a title="EERE Network News" href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm" target="_blank">EERE Network News</a>, a free newsletter of the U.S. Department of Energy.</h5>
