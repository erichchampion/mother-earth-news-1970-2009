        <p>Woohoo! MAX won Escape from Berkeley!</p><p><strong>What’s MAX?</strong> It’s a superefficient DIY car we’re developing for the $10 million Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize competition. (See <a title="Here Comes the 100-mpg Car" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/2008-08-01/MAX-100-MPG-Car.aspx" target="_blank">Here Comes the 100-mpg Car</a>.)</p><p><strong>What’s Escape from Berkeley?</strong> It was an alternative fuels rally that went from Berkeley, Calif., to Las Vegas. The theme was a half-in-jest look at a future without gas or money. The rules were you could start with 1 gallon of petroleum-based fuel; the rest of whatever propelled your passage could not be petroleum-based, and had to be acquired by bartering, begging or any other non-monetary means. The three-day route was planned for a 600-mile course that went over the Sierra Mountains at the 9,943-foot Tioga Pass, and then down across Death Valley to Sin City. It sounded like a good time to me and Sharon Westcott, one of my cohorts at Kinetic Vehicles.</p><p>For MAX’s fuel, we chose straight vegetable oil. We got a conversion kit from PlantDrive and installed it to work with MAX’s diesel engine. Thanks to MAX’s great fuel economy, we only needed a dozen 40-ounce bottles of cooking oil a day, which we begged from customers at grocery stores, showing our appreciation with commemorative T-shirts and copies of <em><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></em>.</p><p>Our main competition was the “Green Team,” which had a truck that runs on wood chips. They were the pre-race favorites, but they had to pull a trailer to carry their wood, and MAX is certainly faster than a truck pulling half a ton of lumber. When Tioga Pass was closed due to a snowstorm, we all had to backtrack and the 600-mile race became an 800-mile race. By the second night, MAX held a healthy lead. On day three, we reached the finish line, winning $5,000.</p><p>From home (Oregon) to Las Vegas and back, we put 2,400 miles on MAX and averaged 55 mpg, which is great considering the mpg-unfriendly conditions we encountered. Now we’re looking forward to MAX being the favorite in next year’s race!</p><p></p><hr /><h5>(To follow MAX’s progress, read <a title="MAX Updates" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/blogs/blog.aspx?blogid=1500&tag=MAX" target="_blank">MAX Updates</a>, in the <a title="Energy Matters" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/blogs/blog.aspx?blogid=1500" target="_blank">Energy Matters</a> blog.)</h5>
