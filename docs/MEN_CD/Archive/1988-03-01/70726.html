                <p><strong>      Kitchen Garden</strong></p>					 <p>     These garden pearls are the sweet gift of spring.</p>        <h5 id="byline">By Sara Pacher</h5>		 <p>      After a long winter without fresh homegrown produce,      peas-traditionally among the first crops to be      planted-reward a gardener's patience with a crisp,      sweet taste that embodies springtime. And, like homegrown      corn and tomatoes, peas straight from the garden are so      superior in both taste and texture to anything found in      stores that they're well worth the space a patch consumes      and the time it takes to produce a bountiful harvest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What to Grow</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pisum sativum</em> is one of the world's oldest      cultivated crops. Peas were foraged from the wild for      thousands of years before they were domesticated; however,      the large wildlings gathered by our cave-dwelling ancestors      were probably roasted and peeled like chestnuts. Greeks and      Romans thought green peas were poisonous unless they were      dried to cure their "noxious and stomach-destroying      canker."    </p>    <p>      It wasn't until the sixteenth century that a French      gardener developed a hybrid green pea that much later      became the rage in the court of Louis XIV. Madame de      Maintenon wrote, "There are ladies here who, having supped      with the King and supped well, retire to the privacy of      their chambers, there to feast in secret on dishes of      petits pois. This is both a fashion and a madness!"    </p>    <p>      Since those days of petit pois mania, many varieties of      peas have been developed. They now come in early types      (harvested in seven or eight weeks), midseason (ready in      eight or nine weeks) and late varieties (requiring 10 weeks      to maturity). Some peas produce tall vines that need      supports, while dwarf types often can stand alone. Among      English-or green-peas there are both      smooth-seeded and wrinkle-seeded types, which must be      removed from their fibrous shells. Snow or sugar peas are      eaten pods and all, and sugar snaps can be eaten as young      pods or allowed to mature into equally tasty shelled peas.    </p>    <p>      When selecting a variety, be aware that vining types      usually produce a heavier crop than do most dwarfs, and      wrinkle-seeded peas tend to be sweeter than the smooth      ones. (For autumn and winter plantings, choose a hardier      smooth variety.)    </p>    <p>      You can ensure a long harvest by sowing early, midseason      and late varieties at the same time, making successive      sowings about two weeks apart until the middle of May. As      the weather warms, however, the roots should be kept cool      with a heavy mulch; failure to do so could result in the      peas not setting fruit, and already-formed pods not filling      out. (Generally speaking, one pound of seeds will plant a      100-foot row, which should produce a bushel of green peas      or two bushels of edible-podded peas.) Various varieties      are known for their disease resistance (early, dwarf      Maestro, for example), wilt resistance (Compact Oregon      Sugar Pod), fresh-eating quality (midseason Lincoln) or      long productivity (late-season Parlay or Mighty Midget).    </p>    		<p>      <strong>How to Grow</strong>    </p>    <p>      Peas are a cool-weather crop that can survive frosts      (except when blossoming), but most varieties won't tolerate      temperatures over 75°F. In southern climates,      therefore, peas are often planted in the mid to late fall      for a very early harvest the following spring. Elsewhere in      the country, early, midseason and late varieties can all be      sown four to six weeks before the last frost date in an      open, sunny spot protected from high winds. The soil,      however, must have warmed up to at least 40°F.    </p>    <p>      Peas prefer a sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5 (the      ideal is 7.0), but they can even be raised in heavy clay if      enough organic matter is added to the soil to improve its      texture and drainage. Phosphorus and potash should be      worked into the plot in the autumn. Use phosphate rock,      bone meal, granite dust and/or wood ashes. Remember,      however, that peas make their own nitrogen and that too      much of that fertilizer will result in a lot of foliage but      few pods.    </p>    <p>      To insure a high germination rate, soak seeds for 24 hours      and dust them with a legume inoculant (available at most      garden supply stores) to help the young plants take      nitrogen from the air and fix it in their roots. Then space      the seeds of low-growing bush varieties at one-inch      intervals in rows two feet apart. Cover with about an inch      of heavy soil or two inches of light soil, and tamp down      lightly. (Later plantings should be twice as deep.) As they      grow, bush varieties will entwine and prop each other up.      Plant vining types in the same manner in double rows six to      eight inches apart on either side of five- or six-foot-tall      wire or string mesh or brush supports. Leave three feet      between each double row. Fill some of the space between      rows with radishes, spinach, lettuce or other early greens.      (Cucumbers and potatoes are good companion plants, but keep      garlic and onions at a distance, since peas don't thrive      when planted near alliums.)    </p>    <p>      Once the peas are in the ground, provide adequate moisture.      Though the soil should never be water-logged, don't allow      it to dry out when the peas are in bloom or when the pods      are swelling. On the other hand, adding too much water      before the plants flower will reduce the yields.    </p>    <p>      Since peas grown in good soil need no further fertilizer,      the only other task will be weeding. Gently hand-pull any      intruders growing near or between the vines to keep from      damaging the peas' roots. A good organic mulch, such as      straw or lawn clippings, placed around the base of the      plants will virtually eliminate this task and will also      help keep the soil moist.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What to Watch For</strong>    </p>    <p>      Crop rotation is one of the best ways to protect peas from      diseases. To avoid fungi which cause root rot, as well as      wilt, bacterial blight and anthracnose, don't grow peas in      the same spot more than once every five years. In the      Southeast, fight fusarium wilt (or pea yellows)-which      turns the plants yellow, then causes them to brown, shrivel      and die-by planting a wilt-resistant variety.    </p>    <p>      Powdery mildew is likely to attack in warm weather,      covering the plant with a downy white fungal coating that      sucks out its nutrients through tiny tubes. If applied ear      ly, sulfur dust will kill the fungi. Avoid it by planting      quick-maturing varieties.    </p>    <p>      The most common pests on developing vines are pea aphids,      which can be defeated with sprays from the garden hose,      garden-grade diatomaceous earth, wood ashes or sticky      traps. The small, brownish white pea weevil bores into      mature pods to lay its eggs. It can be discouraged by early      planting, or by heating possibly infested seed to 120°F      for five hours.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How to Harvest and Use</strong>    </p>    <p>      The pods are usually ready to pick about three weeks after      blossoming, but it's better to risk gathering too early      than too late. If the peas are allowed to become ripe and      hard, their sugar quickly turns to starch, and the      vegetable loses much of its flavor. For the same reason,      you'll enjoy the taste and texture of your peas much more      if you prepare them immediately after harvesting.    </p>    <p>      The shelled varieties should be picked when plump and      bright green. Edible pods should be flat-just barely      showing their developing peas. Pick daily, both to catch      the peas at their prime and to encourage the formation of      new pods. Use scissors to cut the pods from the vines;      otherwise, you may pull up the whole plant or shock it into      nonproduction.    </p>    <p>      Once a vine has quit producing, cut it off and toss it in      the compost pile. The nitrogen-rich root nodules remain in      the ground as an aid to a following crop of brassicas.      Carrots, beets or beans are also good follow-ups for peas.    </p>    <p>      Whether eaten or preserved, peas should be processed      immediately after picking to best retain their flavor. To      can peas, shell and pack them in boiling water and a half      teaspoon of salt to within one-half inch of the top of pint      jars, and then process them for 25 minutes at five pounds      of pressure.    </p>    <p>      Freezing is probably the best way to preserve peas'      fresh-from-the-garden flavor. Just shell and blanch for one      and a half minutes, then cool, drain, pack, and freeze.      Snow peas, which are frozen whole, are treated in the same      way. (Be sure to string the snow peas first.) Peas have a      freezer life of about 12 months.    </p>    <p>      If you've allowed the peas to become overripe, it's best to      shell them and spread them out on a flat surface to dry for      three weeks, or until all the moisture has evaporated.      Store in dry, airtight containers and use as you would any      dried beans.    </p>    <p>      Peas are most tasty, though, when eaten fresh,      and-like most vegetables-they are more      nutritious when raw. Even when blanched, three-quarters of      a cup of peas con tains around 84 calories, 316 milligrams      of potassium, 27 units of vitamin C and 640 units of      vitamin A. Snow peas are probably most commonly used as      ingredients in stir- fries, but can also add color and      crispness to numerous other dishes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fresh Pea Soup</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 pounds fresh, shelled peas<br />      Salt to taste<br />      1 scallion, finely chopped<br />      1 tablespoon chopped mint<br />      1 1/2 cups heavy cream    </p>    <p>      In a saucepan, cover peas with water (there should be 1 /2"      of liquid on top of the vegetables) and bring to a boil.      Add salt, scallion and mint. Cover and simmer for 10      minutes or until tender. Process in a blender until the      mixture is smooth. Add cream and blend again briefly.      Reheat, or serve chilled with a garnish of minced chives.      Serves 6.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Party Peas</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 pound cooked peas, either English or snow<br />      2 slices bacon, cut into 1/2" pieces<br />      1 stalk celery, diced<br />      1 medium onion, diced<br />      1 cup spinach, finely shredded<br />      1 teaspoon flour<br />      1/ 3 cup beef or chicken broth<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1/4 cup toasted slivered almonds    </p>    <p>      In a 9" skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until almost      crisp. Add celery and onion and continue cooking until      bacon is crisp. Add spinach, cover, and simmer for 5      minutes. Stir in flour, add broth, and stir constantly      until thick. Add peas, salt and almonds, and toss until      heated. Serves 6.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      SUSAN SAYS    </h2>    <p>      Here are some suggestions from MOTHER'S gardener, Susan      Sides:    </p>    <p>      If you're using wire fencing instead of string or brush to      stake climbing pea vines (and I've found that some bush      varieties need low supports, too), I recommend using      two-inch-by-four-inch or four-inch-by-four-inch fencing      rather than chicken wire. The large holes enable you to      reach through the wire mesh and pick from both sides, and      make the removal of spent or dry vines easier.    </p>    <p>      Make sure that the young shoots take hold on whatever      staking method you use, rather than grabbing on to each      other. If they get away from you and cavort into a tangled      mess, they're next to impossible to separate without a      great deal of damage to the vines.    </p>
