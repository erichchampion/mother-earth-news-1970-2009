                <p>      <strong>TO YOUR HEALTH</strong>    </p>          <p>The health risks of yo-yo diets.    </p>        <p>      When it concerns the fitness of body, mind or <em>spirit,      the editors at</em> American Health <em>are</em> <em>there,      staying on top of up-to-date research,</em> <em>separating      fads from facts, and helping you</em> <em>preserve and      improve life's most precious gift</em> <em>your good      health. Here are just a few items</em> <em>culled from      their current and upcoming issues,</em> <em>one of which      concerns the danger of gaining back</em> <em>lost      pounds.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Yo-Yo Dieting</strong>    </p>    <p>      We are a nation of "yo-yo" dieters with <em>31%</em> of      American women dieting at least once a month. Yet,      Northwestern University researchers report that men who      showed the greatest up-and-down weight swings also had the      highest risk of sudden death from coronary heart disease.      Gaining and relosing weight can also distort the      weight-regulation system. The more diets you go on, the      harder it is to lose weight, because-when you cut      calories-your basal metabolic rate, used for routine      maintenance functions like breathing and cell repair      <em>(65%</em> to <em>70%</em> of the body's total energy      use), drops measurably within <em>24</em> hours and can      decline a full <em>20%</em> within two weeks. This is one      reason dieters often reach a plateau some weeks into the      diet, finding the same caloric intake no longer produces      weight loss. Your body also adapts to dieting by making      your body more efficient at fat storage, and this change      can persist even if you regain your lost weight.    </p>    <p>      In addition, people on crash diets or ones low in protein      can lose a substantial amount of muscle. Then, if they gain      the weight back, they may regain less muscle and more fat.      Yo-yo dieting also appears to increase the desire for fatty      foods. (In animal experiments at Yale, when given a choice      of carbohydrate, protein or fat, rats, after dieting,      preferred fat for a period of time.) Weight cycling also      tends to shift fat from the thighs or hips to the abdomen,      and research has shown that fat above the waist raises the      risk of heart disease and diabetes more than fat below the      waist.    </p>    <p>      Which brings us to that age-old question: Is it better to      have lost and gained than never to have lost at all? The      best approach to this complex issue is to eat a low-fat,      highcomplex-carbohydrate diet and get regular aerobic      exercise. Permanent weight loss is the goal (who wants to      do this <em>again),</em> so select a program that will help      change your lifestyle. Even if you've been a yo-yo dieter      in the past, don't despair; you can still take control of      your weight. It may just require a little more patience and      effort this time around-and, most of all, a      determination to <em>maintain</em> that hard-earned loss.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How Far, Not How Fast</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Distance is more important than pace," say Dr. Terry      Kavanagh, a cardiologist at the Toronto Rehabilitation      Center, after comparing the cholesterol profiles of two      groups of runners averaging seven- and 10-minute miles and      walkers taking <em>16</em> minutes to cover a mile. All      exercisers lowered overall cholesterol levels equally and      improved the proportion of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs,      the "good" protective cholesterol), provided they covered      the same distance. The most significant changes occurred      beyond <em>12</em> miles a week, whether walking or      running.    </p>        <h3>      Togetherness    </h3>    <p>      A study of long-term relationships found that the longer a      couple had been together, the closer their scores of math      and vocabulary tests became. But, because of economic      factors, husbands influenced their wives' intelligence more      than wives influenced their husbands', since a smart wife      may not earn enough to improve her husband's lifestyle      (hence mind), while intelligent husbands, who are apt to be      well-off, often have extensive opportunities for      self-improvement. In yet another study of couples' recent      and long-ago photos, it was discovered that spouses even      grow to look like one another. What's more, the couples who      looked most alike were the happiest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A</strong> <strong>Bit of Yourself</strong>    </p>    <p>      According to a Gallup poll, only one of five Americans who      are aware of organ donation have signed an organ donor      card, but all you need are two witnesses and the      appropriate form. You can sign on the back of most driver's      licenses, or you can get a donor card free from your local      Eye Bank or Red Cross or the United Network for Organ      Sharing (3001 Hungary Spring Rd., Richmond, VA 23228). Even      with a signed card, hospitals will want to obtain family      consent before organs can be removed, so tell your loved      ones how you feel. For more information on organ donation,      or to locate a donor support group in your area, contact      the American Council on Transplantation, P.O. Box 1709,      Alexandria, VA 22313, 800/ACT-GIVE.    </p>        <h3>      Less Is Best    </h3>    <p>      Folks with sensitive skins complain of dryness, itching,      burning or eruptions-or all of the above. "The best      way to handle skin," says Albert Kligman, University of      Pennsylvania dermatology professor, "is to leave it alone.      He urges such people to list their skincare      products-cleansers, moisturizers and makeup-and      why they use each one. If a product or step can be      eliminated, Kligman advises to do so.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A</strong> <strong>Cirrhosis Cure?</strong>    </p>    <p>      In just-released results of a 14-year study, colchicine, a      widely available drug used to treat sufferers from gout,      actually doubled the survival rate of patients with      cirrhosis. What's more, two cirrhosis patients were found      to have normal livers after several years of colchicine      treatment. Hepatic scar tissue in seven others had reversed      to the point that drug therapy was no longer judged      necessary by medical experts.    </p>
