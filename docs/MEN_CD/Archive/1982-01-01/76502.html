            <p>      Issue # 73 - January/February 1982    </p>        <p>      <strong>For the past several years, the good folks at the      Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Washington, D.C. have      been working to help urban residents gain greater control      over their lives through the use of low-technology,      decentralist tools and concepts. We strongly believe that      more people (city dwellers and country folk alike) should      be exposed to the institute's admirable efforts... which is      why we've made this "what's happening where" report by the      ILSR staffers one of MOTHER's regular features.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most recycling takes place at the local level, with      material being salvaged in city dumps, on the curbsides of      neighborhood streets, and at drop-off recycling centers.      Therefore, the majority of the laws and regulations that      encourage or inhibit this type of conservation are enacted      by individual communities... and many recycling activists      are passing up Washington, D.C. in order to work with their      local city councils, county commissions, and state      agencies. The efforts of such concerned citizens have      produced a number of new laws that break down barriers to      recycling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LITTER TAXES</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Litter tax" laws and state resource recovery bonding      authorities are probably, at present, the most reliable      sources of funds for recyclers, but both of these      approaches have their drawbacks.    </p>    <p>      Litter and recycling taxes are paid by manufacturers,      distributors, or retailers of products. The collected funds      are then distributed, in the form of grants or loans, to      litter education groups or recycling activities. Such taxes      have brought in some $10 million, nationally, over the past      few years.    </p>    <p>      However, the programs do represent a compromise: They allow      the packaging industry to tax itself as an alternative to      accepting container legislation ("bottle bills")... and      encourage recyclers to forgo bottle-bill efforts in      exchange for needed capital. According to Armen Stepanian      of the Fremont Recycling Station in Seattle, litter taxes      that are used to set up comprehensive curbside recycling      operations will result in saving far more material than      that represented by the 6% to 8% of the waste stream      typically eliminated by a bottle bill.    </p>    <p>      Litter taxes have been opposed, however, by the National      Association of Recycling Industries (NARI), a trade      association of salvage dealers. NARI feels that the taxes      subsidize competitors to established salvage operations,      and its members are particularly disturbed because some      litter-tax grantees have used capital to handle commercial      and industrial waste streams rather than household waste      streams, as was intended.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, the grants have been consistently awarded to      groups planning to build collection systems. But such      centers deal with only half of the recycling process. If      there's no way to <em>use</em> the collected materials,      markets quickly become saturated... prices fall... and the      entire system is undermined. For the most part, market      development-which would encourage the processing of      collected material-has gone unfunded.    </p>    <p>      There are still other problems in the manner in which the      tax is commonly used. Recyclers in Colorado, for example,      found that $388,000 of the $486,000 so far collected by      that state's litter tax has gone to industry-sponsored      cleanup programs. Projects of this sort are extremely      unpopular among recyclers, who generally feel that litter      control is a minor problem when compared to the task of      adapting our current solid-waste management practices to a      system that's based on recycling.    </p>    <p>      And even though litter taxes provide a steady cash flow, as      container legislation doesn't, evidence from several states      that <em>have</em> bottle bills shows that such laws tend      to encourage other forms of recycling. In Oregon,      Connecticut, Ohio, and Michigan, bottle bills have      stimulated new private and community businesses that redeem      and process deposit glass, metal, and plastic containers.      In Charlotte, Michigan the Owens-Illinois glass plant now      recycles 300 tons per day, a dramatic increase. And in      Oregon, where virtually <em>no</em> glass was reprocessed      before that state's bottle bill was passed, a single plant      is recycling 40,000 tons per year.    </p>    <p>      "Deposit legislation," concludes a survey prepared by Tania      Lipshutz and Jerry Powell, "results in massive      multimaterial recycling and good opportunities for      community recyclers, while improving the professionalism of      municipal recycling." No wonder that, in at least two      litter-tax states (California and Colorado), there are      renewed efforts to pass container deposit legislation. For      too long, many activists believe, litter taxes have      actually helped to prolong the use of one-way beverage      containers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RESOURCE RECOVERY</strong>    </p>    <p>      In those states that have resource recovery agencies      (California, Ohio, Connecticut, Florida, New York, and      Wisconsin), recyclers generally aren't given a fair share      of the economic pie, even though they require much smaller      amounts of capital than do the waste-to-energy projects      that <em>do</em> receive bonds, loans, and grants. In      Wisconsin, recyclers and environmentalists have had to form      a low-technology advisory committee to press the state's      Resource Recovery Authority to take an even-handed view of      the alternative approach to using waste.    </p>    <p>      And in New York a lobbying coalition (led by county      environmental managers in Ulster and Westchester Counties)      convinced that state's legislature to direct-in      1978-$1 million of the $175 million reserved for      resource recovery bonds exclusively to recycling projects.      Unfortunately, because of excessive restrictions on how the      funds could be spent, little of the money was actually used      by recyclers... but the more recent 1980 New York Resource      Recovery Act, thanks to the continued efforts of lobbyists,      allots $5 million to recycling and reduces the requirements      for eligibility.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LANDFILL FEES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Landfill surcharges are the most recent approach to raising      capital for recycling projects. Two states have passed laws      requiring landfill users to pay such fees, and the      legislation is just now taking effect. The Colorado law      allows landfill charges to be used for solid-waste      management, regardless of where or how it is done. (Before,      all the fees had to figure in the operating budget of the      landfill.)    </p>    <p>      Tim McClure-of Summit Recycling in Breckenridge,      Colorado-is waiting to see how his state's approach      compares to a similar program in New Jersey. In Colorado      each county will control the transfer of landfill fees to      recycling projects. In New Jersey, on the other hand, a      state office will collect fees from 250 landfills and then      distribute the funds among local communities.    </p>    <p>      "Watching both states will give us a good opportunity to      determine which level of government is best able to conduct      this type of business," McClure said. He'll be reporting on      the comparative administrative costs in future issues of      <em>Renews</em> , which he edits for the Colorado Recycling      Cooperative Association (Dept. TMEN, Box 472, Breckenridge,      Colorado 80424).    </p>    <p>      The New Jersey Recycling Act has drawn national attention      because it's the first to involve community-based recyclers      and environmentalists as well as government officials and      industry representatives. Under the plan, municipal and      private-sector recyclers can count on an annual cash flow      for five years: Communities will receive funds based upon      the amount of solid waste that they recycle annually.    </p>    <p>      Plans like New Jersey's couldn't come at a better time for      recyclers. Waste-to-energy plants, which <em>burn</em>      solids and directly compete with recycling, have just lost      large portions of their federal subsidies (a $29 to $50      billion Department of Energy plan has just been scuttled by      President Reagan). At the same time, high interest rates      and weak tax-exempt-bond markets have cut back private      investment in waste-to-energy schemes. As a result, the      prospects for incorporating recycling into an overall      waste-management program have never looked better!    </p>    <p>      <em>The Institute for Local Self-Reliance is keeping track      of community and state laws that promote or discourage      recycling.
