            <p>      Issue # 73- January/February 1982    </p>    <p>      The natural cycle of rainfall and evaporation is our      earth's method of cleansing itself. However, the stability      of that fundamental cycle is currently in jeopardy because      of...    </p>            <p>      You can measure the acidity or alkalinity of<br /> your own      drinking<br /> water, pond, etc. with a litmus<br /> papaer kit      (available at most well<br />-equipped pharmacies). The<br /> package      you see in this<br /> photo cost less than $5.00 and can<br /> measure      pH's between 4.5 and<br /> 7.5. The litmus is used by dipping <br />it      into the solution to be tested,<br /> then shaking off excess      liquid.<br /> The paper quickly changes color, and<br /> the hue can be      matched to the<br /> key on the paper's package.<br /> The litmus in      this photograph indicates<br /> a pH level of between 4.5 and      5.0. <br />MOM's Eco-Village lake showed <br />similar readings . . .      definitely a<br />danger sign for the water's<br /> inhabitants. In      fact, we were<br /> surprised (and alarmed) to<br /> discover how low      the <br />pH is in many area lakes, in the<br /> Hendersonville city      water supply,<br /> and in staff members' private<br /> wells.    </p>        <p>      The largest contributors to acid<br /> precipitation are      coal<br />-fired power plants.    </p>    <p>      Next to air, without which we could survive for only a few      minutes, water is the compound most necessary to human      life. Not only do we drink it-to help our bodies      perform a number of vital functions-but we cleanse      ourselves with it, grow food with it, and harvest the      bounty of its lakes and streams. In fact, throughout      history the single most important reason for a human's      picking a spot to live has usually been the presence of an      adequate supply of clean water.    </p>    <p>      Of course, Western civilization's attitude toward the      precious liquid has changed somewhat in the last 100 years.      Water is now delivered to most people in developed      countries through mazes of pipes and faucets, rather than      directly from wells or streams. And it's entirely possible      that the attitudes engendered by take-it-for-granted tap      water have helped cause the pollution and shortage problems      we face today. In little more than a decade, the threat to      our drinking supplies has become a top-priority concern.    </p>    <p>      In fact, ten years ago few people even recognized the      danger in what was then a puzzling new phenomenon ... acid      precipitation. Acid rain, as it's often called, is a direct      result of the burning of fossil fuels, and it's the      <em>first</em> water-quality problem that's managing to      cross state and national boundaries on a daily basis.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Acidified precipitates (which can include rain, snow, other      forms of atmospheric moisture, and dry acidic particles)      are produced when sulfur oxides (SO 2 . and S0 3 ) or      nitrogen oxides (NOx)-or, to a minor extent, hydrogen      chloride (HCI)-react with air and water in the      presence of sunlight. Though the actual mechanisms that      produce acid precipitation are not thoroughly understood,      there's little question that they result in sulfuric,      nitric, and/or hydrochloric acid buildup that can render      rainwater as sour as vinegar!    </p>    <p>      The primary sources of sulfur emissions (which are      estimated to cause about two-thirds of all acid      precipitation today) are coal-fired power plants (Ohio's      electric utilities are the largest producers in the U.S.)      and smelters (International Nickel in Sudbury, Ontario      pumps out 1%-roughly 2,500 tons-of the world's daily      total). Nitrogen emissions, on the other hand, come largely      from transportation sources (about 40%), with effluents      from power plants and industry making up the rest.    </p>    <p>      Though such pollutants usually remain in the atmosphere for      no more than five days (NO hangs on longer than does SO 2      .), they've been known to show up as far as 700 miles      downwind of their sources, in the form of sulfates and      nitrates. These two substances are the major producers of      acid rain. And ironically enough, if it weren't for the      Clean Air Act of 1970, they probably wouldn't have gotten a      chance to travel so far and do so much harm.    </p>    <p>      In order to comply with the act's standards, many utilities      and industries-in the early 1970's-built tall      smokestacks to disperse emissions (which, for the purpose      of law enforcement, are measured at ground, or nose,      level). Though no one anticipated the problem at the time,      the superstacks (International Nickel's is 1,250 feet high)      help sulfur and nitrogen stay airborne long enough to cause      full-fledged acid precipitation.    </p>    <p>      Of course, coal-fired plants that have been built since the      passage of the Clean Air Act are equipped with sulfur      scrubbers and are relatively clean. The older      (uncontrolled) plants now spew out most of the sulfur oxide      emissions that enter the atmosphere. Consequently, it's of      vital concern that the oil-fired power plants currently      being converted to coal not be considered "old"-and      thus unconrollable-for regulatory purposes.    </p>    <p>      Nitrogen oxide, the other major cause of acid      precipitation, is much more difficult to deal with than is      sulfur oxide. Because there is no suitable control      technology yet, NO x production is likely to remain      essentially unchecked for as much as a decade. Rollbacks      and/or delays in clean air standards (both of which are      advocated by the Reagan administration) could further      postpone effective control of nitrogen oxide emissions.    </p>        <p>      JUST HOW ACID DOES IT RAIN?    </p>    <p>      The acidity or alkalinity of a solution-as many of      you already know-is measured numerically (the levels      range from 0 to 14) on what's called a pH scale. A pH of 7      is neutral, while smaller numbers are acid and larger ones      are basic (alkaline). The rating is actually a measure of      the concentration of hydrogen ions ... and it builds      logarithmically (that is, pH6 is 10 times more acidic than      pH7, pH5 100 times more than pH7, and pH4 1,000 times more      than pH7).    </p>    <p>      The pH of pure rainfall happens to be slightly lower than      neutral (about pH5.6), because the moisture reacts with      naturally occurring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to      produce dilute carbonic acid. Hence, precipitation that has      a pH of less than 5.6 is generally considered to have been      made acid by some human activity. Historic records,      obtained from core samples of polar ice, indicate that      world precipitation has been slowly growing more acid over      the last 100 years. (Episodes of acid rain have occurred      naturally for eons-caused by sulfur released from      volcanic eruptions, for example-but these sources      contribute a very small part of this century's growing      total.)    </p>    <p>      Though Swedish scientists were the first to pinpoint the      harmful effects of acid precipitation, U.S. researchers      have been keeping track of rainfall pH since the 1950's. As      far back as the middle of that decade, precipitation with a      pH of 4.5 was occasionally recorded in a few areas of the      Northeast. But by 1979 the <em>average</em> pH of rainfall      in the entire eastern U.S. had fallen to below 4.5 . . .      and many areas now regularly report pH readings as low as      3.4 (close to the acidity of vinegar). Nor is acid      precipitation limited to the eastern U.S. In the Los      Angeles basin, for example, typical pH levels have fallen      from around 7 in the 1950's to between 4.5 and 5 at      present.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT DOES IT DO?</strong>    </p>    <p>      The overall effect that acid precipitation has on a      particular ecosystem depends largely upon the soil and      water's ability to tolerate the incoming low pH liquid.      Areas rich in calcium or magnesium carbonates (limestone      and dolomite, respectively) and/or organic matter are, as      yet, able to buffer the acidity of the rain, in much the      same fashion that an antacid tablet relieves a sour      stomach. Ironically, the Midwest (where a large portion of      the sulfur oxide emissions are produced) has good buffering      capability overall. But down wind-in New York,      Pennsylvania, and West Virginia-the soils are formed      mostly from igneous rock that's low in buffering compounds.    </p>    <p>      In the Adirondack Mountain region of New York (which has      been the hardest-hit area of the U.S.), over 200 lakes are      now considered acidified, with an average pH of less than      4.5. (Remember, that's 500 times more acid than a normal      lake.) To the north-in Ontario,      Canada-400-lakes have been lost to acid      precipitation, and 48,000 more are threatened. (And despite      the prodigious emissions of the nickel plant in Sudbury,      it's estimated that two-thirds of Canada's acid      precipitation results from airborne contaminants produced      in the U.S.A.)    </p>    <p>      In order to appreciate the potential damage we're talking      about, it's important to understand what happens when a      body of water goes acid. More than 50% of the lakes with pH      readings of less than 5 have no fish at all. Even at pH6.5      the reproductive capacity of most trout species begins to      drop ... and the fry that do survive are increasingly prone      to genetic defects. Often, the first hint that a lake is      going acid comes from people who fish there, when they      report a limited catch of large fish (which grow rapidly as      a result of not having to compete with new generations for      food) and few, if any, smaller ones.    </p>    <p>      However, scientists believe that the eventual death of the      fish population in an acid lake isn't caused directly by      the low pH. Rather, it's thought that toxic metals which      are mobilized by the acid precipitation-aluminum and      mercury are the two most prominent offenders-do most      of the damage.    </p>    <p>      Other forms of aquatic life are also severely affected by      low pH. The bacteria that are normally present in      freshwater lakes tend to die back as pH drops, while fungi      are more likely to thrive. Consequently, organic matter      (such as falling leaves) accumulates on the lake's bottom      instead of being consumed. In fact, so many bacterial      organisms, which are normally suspended in the water, die      off that acid lakes are often very clear. (A sure sign of a      lake with low pH is the growth of sphagnum moss on the      bottom . . . since that plant can adapt to an aquatic life      only in acid water.)    </p>    <p>      Because it's been less than ten years since scientists      began to study the effects of acid rain, our understanding      of the problems it causes is by no means complete. While we      are beginning to catalog the effects of low pH on      freshwater lakes, research into the actions of acid      precipitation upon complex land-based ecosystems has barely      started.    </p>    <p>      Still, even the fragmentary available evidence points to a      number of dangerous terrestrial effects ... including      threats to human health. The presence of sulfate and      nitrate compounds in the air over the Northeast has been      shown to correlate with a pollution-related death rate      (resulting from lung disorders and cancer) that is roughly      twice that of areas with cleaner air.    </p>    <p>      Acid rain is also damaging the quality of domestic water      supplies, both private and public. Folks who depend on      cisterns for their potable water may have dangerous levels      of lead, zinc, and/or aluminum in their drinking supplies      ... resulting from deterioration of the catchments and from      suspended material. Throughout much of the East, collecting      rainwater for drinking is unsafe. Furthermore, some      reservoirs have become so acidic that they must be treated      (largely with lime) at tremendous expense. Low-pH water      also increases the corrosion rate of many types of plumbing      ... contaminating drinking supplies with copper, zinc, or      lead from pipes.    </p>    <p>      In many regions it's no longer healthful to eat fish caught      from local lakes, since the creatures are likely to contain      dangerous concentrations of aluminum and/or mercury that      have been liberated by acid precipitation. Officials in New      York advise that children and pregnant women not eat any      fish caught in the state's lakes.    </p>    <p>      Acid precipitation also degrades soil quality and can      result in stunted plant growth. Calcium and magnesium are      leached from the soil by low-pH rain, and such elementary      processes as reproduction, nitrogen fixation, and      photosynthesis may be slowed or interrupted. The protective      waxy coating on leaves is sometimes stripped away by acid      rain, and the presence of low-pH precipitation makes it      especially likely that greenery will draw toxins, such as      lead and cadmium, from the soil. Some crops are more      affected by these problems than others ... but we do know,      for example, that soybean yields in some areas are already      being reduced by acid precipitation.    </p>    <p>      Valuable inanimate materials are also feeling the bite of      contaminated rain, snow, etc. Buildings made from limestone      and marble-substances that are especially      susceptible-are showing prominent pitting (the U.S.      Capitol is a case in point). Even relatively acid-resistant      granite structures are being damaged... since calcium-based      mortar is used to bond the blocks in such buildings.      Furthermore, metals are more prone to corrosion in an acid      environment. It's frightening to contemplate the dollar      value of damage to automobiles that are rapidly rusting      away because of acid rain.    </p>    <p>      If we continue to pour sulfur and nitrogen oxides into our      atmosphere at the present rate, we face an ecological      crisis, a significant risk to human health, and an economic      loss that could be staggering. Unfortunately, such      emissions are likely to increase through the year 2,000.      According to the Environmental Protection Agency, sulfur      emissions can be expected to rise by 10% to 20% in the next      20 years, and those of nitrogen oxides by at least 50%. The      steps taken by Congress to modify the Clean Air Act in late      1981 or early 1982 will be the single most important      influence on such developments.    </p>    <p>      Though there are no regulations today that deal directly      with acid precipitation, there are methods of control      available. By using stack scrubbers, low-sulfur coal,      washed coal, and new technologies such as fluidized bed      furnaces (see MOTHER N0.65, page 182, for an article on a      home scale version of such a device), sulfur emissions      could be cut by as much as 80%. The cost of doing so would      be substantial, but might not be as high as utilities and      our current government would have us think, and the expense      involved in <em>ignoring</em> acid rain could prove to be      much larger in the long run. However, the burning question      is ... <em>can</em> we put a price tag on protecting our      planet's ability to support life?    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you're concerned about acid rain,      write to your representatives and senators (care of The      Capitol, Washington, D.C. 20510).</em>    </p>
