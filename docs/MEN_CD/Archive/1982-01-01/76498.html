                <p>      The worldwide organization that's called Friends of the      Earth is one of the most effective environmental groups in      existence today. However, although FOE publishes its own      journal-the monthly tabloid titled <em>Not</em>      <em>Man Apart</em> <em>-</em> far too few      MOTHERreaders regularly get a chance to see that      publication . . . and that's why we've arranged to bring      you this bimonthly column, which is prepared by the staff      of FOE/NMA.    </p>        <p>      The Reagan administration is continuing to work overtime to      revive the ailing nuclear industry. For several months      after the attempt on the President's life back in April,      the administration seemed able to get whatever programs and      concessions it wanted from Congress. But by the time Mr.      Reagan returned from his four-week August vacation, the      tide showed signs of turning. Polls indicated that the      Chief Officer's popularity was slipping, and some members      of Congress gradually began to get the nerve to challenge a      few of the President's environmental and energy projects.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE NUCLEAR SUBSIDY</strong>    </p>    <p>      President Reagan firmly supports an expanded nuclear      program, so it was no surprise that his nuclear power      policy (issued in early October) was concerned mainly with      the alleged "morass of regulations" that has slowed the      licensing of nuclear power plants. It now takes from 10 to      14 years to get a reactor from planning stage to full-power      licensing ... the President proposes to shorten that to      from six to eight years, "as is typical in some countries".      (The lead time for nuclear reactors in France and Japan is      now about 12 to 14 years. The only country which might now      be able to equal the President's goal is the Soviet Union,      where-until the accident at Three Mile Island made      the potential for destruction evident-reactors were      built without containment domes.)    </p>    <p>      To help prop up the financially ailing industry, the      administration has agreed to pay "in excess of      $100,000,000" toward the costs of cleaning up Three Mile      Island, which are expected to exceed $1,000,000,000. An      electric utility fund will bear some of the cost, as will      the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The owner of the      plant, General Public Utilities, will shell out      $245,000,000, and insurance will pick up the rest of the      tab. Of course, one way or the other, it's the consumers      and taxpayers who will actually have to raise the money.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, despite President Reagan's efforts to push aside      the economic and regulatory barriers to nuclear      development, serious technical problems with pressurized      water reactors (two-thirds of the reactors in the U.S. are      of this type) are making the news. It seems that radiation      and water chemistry have combined to cause corrosion      problems at some plants. At best, the difficulties are      leading to costly (in some instances, well over      $100,000,000) repairs . . . at worst, coolant draining from      a reactor through corroded pipes could produce a serious      accident.    </p>    <p>      Reports released in October also show that reactor vessels      become brittle after prolonged exposure to radiation.      During unforeseen emergency situations, which would require      rapid cooling of the reactor, the possibility of an older      vessel's rupturing is much greater than was formerly      thought. One official from the Nuclear Regulatory      Commission said that such an accident would create a "50/50      chance of an uncontrolled nuclear meltdown".    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE "NEW" EPA</strong>    </p>    <p>      The new administration also promises to handle      <em>chemical</em> regulation a bit differently than has      been the case in recent years. Under the Toxic Substances      Control Act, if strong evidence indicates that a chemical      may cause cancer in humans and that significant numbers of      people are exposed to it, the EPA must limit public      exposure to the compound. Accordingly, EPA staff      recommended, last spring, that formaldehyde (a widely used      agent in manufacturing and consumer products) and DEHP (a      plasticizer used in toys and infants' waterproof pants) be      regulated. However, after months of delay and private      hearings between EPA officials and industry      representatives, the agency appeared to be moving away from      regulation of these chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Lester Brown infiltrated the last of those meetings, and he      reported on the proceedings to his boss, Representative      Toby Moffett, a Democrat from Connecticut. Moffett blasted      the EPA for excluding all but industry officials from the      decisionmaking process and held hearings to look further      into the situation. The episode generated a fair amount of      publicity and proved to be rather embarrassing to the      administration.    </p>    <p>      During mid-October EPA Director Anne Gorsuch appeared at      congressional hearings and skillfully dodged questions      about the agency's 1983 budget . . . claiming that      discussion was premature. Yet EPA memoranda indicate that      the agency may lose as much as 60% of its purchasing power      by 1983. Worse yet, such massive cuts would come at a time      when the agency's workload is expected to double because of      recently enacted legislation concerning toxic chemicals.    </p>    <p>      In fact, concern over those budget cuts has led both the      Senate and the House to hold hearings examining Ms.      Gorsuch's plans for the EPA, and Representative James      Florio of New Jersey has called for Ms. Gorsuch to resign.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: As this story goes to press, the      unofficial results of the New Jersey gubernatorial race      between Mr. Florio and Thomas Kean indicate that Kean has      won the office. According to the New Jersey Public      Relations Gubernatorial Office, out of 2.3 mil</em>      <em>lion votes cast, there is only a 1,600-vote difference      between the two candidates. Barring any court action, the      recount of the votes should be finished, and an official      announcement made of the winner, by December 1, 1981.]</em>      It's likely that members of Congress will be keeping a      close watch over any future EPA action, but the      effectiveness of their scrutiny will depend largely on      whether the legislators feel that their constituents want a      strong Environmental Protection Agency.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WATT IN THE WORLD</strong>    </p>    <p>      On October 19 the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth,      Greenpeace, and the Massachusetts Audubon Society dumped      petitions bearing 1,100,000 signatures on the Capitol steps      . . . calling for the removal of Interior Secretary James      Watt. At an on-the-spot press conference, leaders of the      various groups stressed that they would make sure the      environmental policies of the Reagan administration would      be major issues in the 1982 elections.    </p>    <p>      This threat <em>could</em> prove to be more than mere saber      rattling, since several polls have shown that the public      does support strong environmental protection . . . even at      the expense of economic growth. A recent Harris poll, for      example, found that 72% of the people who voted for Ronald      Reagan, and 76% of the people who consider themselves      political conservatives, oppose any relaxation of the Clean      Air Act (now up for renewal in Congress).    </p>    <p>      Despite the broad opposition to many specific environmental      policies maintained by the present administration, however,      a large percentage of the population, still believe that      President Reagan will make sound environmental decisions.      Consequently, the task at hand is still a large one. We      must show the public that the scandalously bad policies of      Anne Gorsuch, James Watt, and others in the current      administration can-until we see evidence that proves      otherwise-only be interpreted as those of Ronald      Reagan himself.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Letters to legislators can be a tremendous      help. Consequently, Friends of the Earth maintains fists of      people who want up-to-date information on specific issues .      . . and who will, when needed, write letters concerning      pesticides, nuclear power, the Clean Air Act, coastal      development, and mining policy.
