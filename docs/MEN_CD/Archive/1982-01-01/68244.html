            <p>      Issue # 73- January/February 1982    </p>    <p>      Folks who live in cloudy climes can pick up some pointers      from this successful sun-power pioneer.    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTOS    </p>        <p>      The backyard solar collector.    </p>    <p>      The small water-heating<br />      collector.    </p>    <p>      Henry Mathew and his first<br />      sun-powered house .    </p>        <p>      This win dow wall passively<br />      warms the garage/workwhop.    </p>    <p>      Warm air flows front a rent<br />      high in the wall.    </p>    <p>      The cold-air return is beneath<br />      the fireplace.    </p>        <p>      Henry's new solar borne in the<br />      fogbelt nears completion.    </p>    <p>      Back in 1967, when most of the world was still scoffing at      the notion that the sun could be a viable source of home      heat, a retired carpenter and construction millwright named      Henry Mathew built a six-room solar house on Oregon's cool      and very foggy coast. And over the course of the last 15      years, Henry's self-designed system-which consists of      725 square feet of water-type collectors and an      8,000-gallon storage tank-has furnished 75% of his      Coos Bay home's heat in bad years, and as much as 90% to      95% "most of the time"!    </p>    <p>      In fact, the monthly utility bill for his otherwise      all-electric, 1,444-square-foot dwelling rises from      approximately $18 in the summer to all of $22 in the      winter. And Henry's solar success story so impressed the      University of Oregon that its scientists have spent the      past few years monitoring the system with a battery of      instruments.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AHEAD OF HIS TIME</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you might suspect, Henry-a modest, soft-spoken      do-it-yourselfer-has had a long-time interest in      solar energy.    </p>    <p>      "When I was a boy," he recalls, "my father would tell me,      'Someday people are going to store up heat in the ground      ... <em>solar</em> heat.' Then, when I was 40 or 45 years      old, after my father (who was a law-yer) retired in San      Diego, he wrote to me, 'If we could buy some of this      inexpensive desert land down here and put in a solar pump      to irrigate it with, we could make some money.'    </p>    <p>      "Dad's idea sounded good, so we located a book called      <em>Direct Use of the Sun's Energy by Farrington Daniels      [1964, Yale University Press . . . Ballantine paperback,      $1.95]</em> . After he read that book, though, Dad decided      that the project would require too much work, and he backed      out... but I was still sure it was feasible. Then I learned      that Harry Thomason had designed a successful solar house      <em>[see the Plowboy interview with Dr. Thomason in MOTHER      NO . 60]</em> , and I knew right ther, that I could build      one, too ... and maybe even improve upon his design.    </p>    <p>      "The people who've found solar energy unsatisfactory," he      contends, "usually don't pay enough attention to heat stor      age. Now we have rainy periods here, with no direct      sunshine at all, that last three weeks at a time. So we      have to be able to pack away the heat when it <em>is</em>      available. I also believe that most collectors are far too      small. Many that I've seen are about a third as large as      they should be. Of course, you can't blame people for      wanting to economize when they're buying expensive      commercial collectors at $20 to $30 a square foot ... but      when I built mine, the materials cost only about $1.00 to      $1.50 per square foot, so I made sure the panels were big      enough to satisfy my needs."    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Mathew home's rooftop collector consists of a      south-facing, 5-foot-high, 80-foot-long array, installed      7° from vertical. The frame is made of wood backed with      plywood and a 1-1/2" thickness of fiber-glass (for      fireproofing). The heart of the unit is a corrugated sheet      of aluminum coated with flat-black paint. A horizontal,      galvanized iron, parallel-fed 1/2" pipe runs along each      corrugation, and these are tied snugly to the aluminum      sheet with wire. Three slightly overlapping glass panels      (they're 1/16" X 20" X 30"), placed 1-1/2 inches away from      the aluminum, are used to make up each individual panel.      Nearvertical headers are positioned at the ends of the      collector-one to bring water in and the other to let      it out-and arranged so that no liquid can leave until      the collector is entirely full.    </p>    <p>      Another collector of the same general design (it has 325      square feet of surface area) sits on the ground in back of      the house, and there's a small unit on the east side that      flows into Henry's electric water heater. "A pump forces      water to the little collector," Mathew explains. "From      there it runs to the east leg of the backyard unit, flows      through it, then goes to an overhead pipe, where it      connects with the collector on the roof of the house. When      the sun's shining and the collectors are stagnated, the      water temperature can rise to as high as 175°F."    </p>    <p>      <strong>DOUBLED EFFICIENCY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Normally, according to the University of Oregon's studies,      the water temperature would be raised only 5° if it      were to flow straight from one end of the rooftop collector      system to the other (of course, over a series of passes,      the temperature gain would be much higher). but this      ingenious gentleman has doubled that per-pass figure by      simply gluing a single layer of aluminum foil to the roof      with black plastic cement ... and anyone who's ever gotten      a sunburn while ocean fishing on an overcast day knows how      efficient a reflecting surface can be.    </p>    <p>      "I used plastic cement, because it sets up quicker than      does the asphalt type. Then I rolled out the foil and      smoothed it down with a household mop. I imagine that in      regions with acid rain problems, the aluminum foil might      have to be replaced every ten years or so, but mine's been      up a lot longer than that."    </p>    <p>      After the water is warmed by the collectors, it flows into      a 7' X 10', 8,000-gallon tank, which Mathew welded together      him-self right on the premises. This container is buried      beneath the house and is surrounded by a 6" to 18"      insulated airspace that accommodates a cold-air intake and      a hot-air outlet.    </p>    <p>      "The tank," Henry says proudly, "cost me $175 for all-new      steel, and since I've been careful to keep as much air out      of it as possible, it's developed only a few specks of      rust. It should last for another 60 years!    </p>    <p>      "I thought that the water held in the tank would get very      hot in the summertime, but it doesn't. In fact, it stays at      about 100°. Then along in September and      October-just when the heat begins to be      needed-the temperature reaches its peak. Following      that, we usually have rain for weeks, and the water will      start to cool down ... however, the tank's large storage      capacity still allows it to keep the house warm through      that period until-by the middle of December-we      start to get some sunshine again."    </p>    <p>      Whenever the thermostat shows unfavorable solar collection      conditions, the pump automatically stops, and all the water      returns to the tank. Then, when the rooms need heat, hot      air from the space around the tank flows-by      convection-out of a grill high in the living room...      while cold air returns to the tank through an intake      positioned below the fireplace.    </p>    <p>      "The system provides a nice, even, quiet heat," Mathew      points out. "During the coldest months it keeps the living      room at 75°F, while even the bedrooms and baths, which      have no heat vents, often reach 65 °."    </p>    <p>      There's also a large garage/workshop on the west end of the      house, but it's <em>passively</em> heated ... by an      attached greenhouse. The home displays a passive solar      component, too ... a seven-foot overhang along the south      side of the dwelling, which lets the sun stream across the      front living area in the winter but shades the same rooms      in the summer.    </p>    <p>      This innovative house, with Mathew doing all the work      himself, cost about $10,000 to build. Of that, the      materials for the roof collector ran to $1,000, and those      for the backyard unit totaled about $325. But as Henry      points out, material prices have more than doubled since      1967, so you can figure that it would probably cost at      least $20,000 (and likely a good bit more) to duplicate the      structure today.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DEALING WITH SUCCESS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Naturally, when the news that someone was successfully      using solar energy in the fogbelt began to filter out to a      wider world, Mathew was flooded with requests for      information. In order to keep up with the deluge of mail      and phone calls, he drew up some rough plans of his solar      home, which are still available, for $10 postpaid (write to      Henry Mathew, Dept. TMEN, 970 Woodruff, Coos Bay, Oregon      97420). Henry has updated the material from time to time,      but he warns that some of the information could probably      profit from more "modernization". "After all," he says,      "we've learned a lot about using solar power in the last 15      years."    </p>    <p>      In order to put some of that more recent knowledge to use,      Henry is now in the process of putting the finishing      touches on a second solar house, a scant mile east of his      present home. "Since the new location is a bit farther from      the ocean, it gets colder in the winter and hotter in the      summer. Also the site is partially shaded on winter      afternoons, and that forced me to face my collectors      18° toward the east ... so I've overbuilt the solar      heating system by 25% to 30%, using three rows of roof      collectors. However, they're so compact that, if you were      to just drive by, you'd never know the house is solar      heated.    </p>    <p>      "My new collectors are built to tolerate temperatures of      around 350°F. They're backed with metal instead of      plywood, and I used preformed aluminum flashing that      enabled me to snap the pipes in place, rather than tying      them on with wire. In addition, I installed corrugated      fiberglass, which costs only half as much as glass. These      panels are glued in place with transparent silicone and are      holding up well against our winter rain, hail, and 100-MPH      winds. The roof also has a tremendous 60-foot-wide      reflecting area ... which-again-is simply a      single layer of aluminum foil over bare plywood. I figure      that the barrel and a half of roofing cement cost about      $90, and the aluminum foil was about $60 ... which amounts      to a pretty inexpensive way to double a collector s      efficiency."    </p>    <p>      The storage tank for the new house is also larger (9,200      gallons) and is insulated with 3-1/2" of fiberglass all      around, so the stored heat isn't carried through to the      ground.    </p>    <p>      The nearly completed three-bedroom, two-bath, dwelling cost      Mathew $26,000 ($6,000 for the land and $20,000 for      materials)... $3,850 of which went into the solar system.      But again, he did all the labor himself, even bulldozing      his own road in and preparing the construction site.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER asked Henry whether, after all his years of      experience, he'd encountered any problems while      constructing the second building.    </p>    <p>      "With the single rooftop collector on my first house," he      replied, "all the water drains back into the storage tank      whenever the pump stops. But the new home's three      collectors don't all drain instantly or at the same time,      and this fact occasionally caused air to get into the line.      Then, if the pump happened to start up just as an air      pocket hit it, it would lose power. I solved the problem by      putting in about 3 feet of 6" pipe, to allow the bubbles to      rise out of the system."    </p>    <p>      Henry also found that his new storage tank, which was built      in four parts, was subjected to great changes in pressure      when the pump started up ... and eventually one whole      section caved in: "I had to weld a lot of heavy steel over      the top to reinforce it.    </p>    <p>      "I can't really say that I had any other problems.      However," he grinned, "I did make a lot of changes in the      piping system as I went along ... because I just seemed to      keep getting new ideas."    </p>    <p>      Well, that doesn't surprise us a bit. After all, how can a      person be a pioneer without new ideas?    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMING UP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Plans for a simple thermosiphon solar heating system will      appear in issue 74.    </p>
