        <p>A GRAPHIC LESSON: Pennsylvania Power & Light Co.-which serves about one million residents in the central and eastern parts of the Keystone State-has started issuing bills which each contain a bar graph profile of the individual household's electric use for the previous 13 months. PP & L officials believe that the month-by-month charts will promote conservation by encouraging consumers to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and electrical appliances.<br /><br />MOVE OVER LA CHOY: The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to build an "aquafarm" at its Browns Ferry nuclear site in Alabama. TVA intends to raise 80 hogs, whose manure will provide nutrients for algae to feed catfish grown in a pool warmed by the discharge water from the power plant. In turn, fertile pond water will irrigate beds of Chinese water chestnuts. Gross sales from the fish/chestnut enterprise could amount to as much as $5,000 per acre.<br /><br />SOLAR STEAM FINANCING: Luz International of Los Angeles has a unique plan to counter industrial reluctance to invest in solar equipment. The firm will supply steam to three sunbelt textile concerns at a cost that's less than that of the fuel needed to fire a conventional boiler . . . and private investors, who can take advantage of the resulting tax credits and depreciation allowances, will put up the funds to construct the sun-powered generators.<br /><br />WONDER CRYSTAL? Solar scientists are excited over a "wonder crystal" developed by researchers at Japan's Kyoto University. The crystalline synthetic substance reportedly can gather, store, and release substantial quantities of solar energy. It's claimed that a single kilogram of the material can absorb 92 kilocalories of energy, which is enough to heat a kilogram of water from 8°C to 100°C.<br /><br />ENERGY IN A BOX: In this column in issue 66, we mentioned that zeolite-a dense, buff-colored, crumbly mineral-might prove to be a valuable storage medium for solar energy. Well, here are two developments that zeolite watchers may be interested in: Wood's Solar Systems of Calgary, Canada, which funded the initial research into the substance's capabilities, is building seven solar homes with zeolite storage . . . and the firm is testing a portable system, also using the mineral, that could be employed to capture industrial waste heat. The "hot boxes" would then be carried to homes or greenhouses to discharge their warmth.<br /><br />A KITCHEN APPLIANCE FOR THE THIRD WORLD: The hit at a United Nations-sponsored energy exposition in Kenya was a fuel-stingy "jiko" . . . a clay cookstove, with a 29% heating efficiency, that can be fired with only a handful of wood chips or charcoal. Nearly half of the world's population depends on wood, charcoal, animal dung, and agricultural waste for cooking fuel . . . and open fires use up such materials faster than they can be supplied.<br /><br />CELLULOSE CONVERSION: University of Florida scientists have applied for a patent on a top-secret process reputed to convert cellulosic material into glucose, at a whopping 85% yield rate, from which methane gas or alcohol can be produced. Experts say the process-which involves treatments with a strong mineral acid, abrasion, and pressure-is probably similar to the one to be employed in a proposed $19 million plant in the Philippines . . . which, it's hoped, will convert large quantities of agricultural waste into fuel.<br /><br />A BUNNY WITH THE HICCUPS: The first completely alcohol-powered cars produced in America have rolled off the assembly line at the Volkswagen plant in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania. The 37 VW Rabbits and pickups, which were funded through a California Energy Commission Program, cost (for the present) about $3,000 apiece more than the gasfueled models . . . and the vehicles feature high compression (12.5 to 1) engine ratios, special wiring harnesses, Bosch fuel-injection systems, and electric air preheating systems.<br /><br />HYDRATED SALTS USED IN PHASE-CHANGE STORAGE SYSTEMS can now be stabilized through a new processinvolving the incorporation of a nucleating agent-that's been patented by researchers at Israel's Casali Institute of Applied Chemistry. The additive apparently inhibits the deterioration of salts that are subjected to the successive freezing/melting cycles characteristic of devices that depend on time-locked energy sources.<br /><br />Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have developed a new energy-efficient glass, with exceptional visual clarity, that INSULATES AS WELL AS STYRENE FOAM .... Atlantic City Electric Co., which serves southern New Jersey, is offering $500 REBATES TO THE FIRST 100 CUSTOMERS WHO BUILD WINDMILLS .... The Department of Energy's Argonne Laboratory has built a giant SUPERCONDUCTING DIPOLE MAGNET , which possesses a magnetic field 120,000 times more powerful than that of the earth. The unit will be tested in magnetohydrodynamic power generators at the Coal-Fired Flow Facility near Tullahoma, Tennessee .... United International Research says it has invented a COAL GASIFICATION PROCESS that will utilize the C02 produced by the manufacture of synthetic fuels rather than emitting dangerous quantities of the gas into the atmosphere .... The U.S. Geological Survey, in a report agreeing with CIA conclusions, has predicted that the U.S.S.R'S "SUPERGIANT" OIL FIELDS will maintain their current production levels until 1985, and then drop off sharply. Part of the expected decline is attributed to an unsuccessful water-flooding technique, which was intended to stabilize underground pressure and flush the oil to surface wells .... ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST SOLAR-HEATED SWIMMING POOLS will be installed at the new national complex of the Professional Golfers' Association. The 87,000-gallon PGA pool will be heated by 80 sealed-air collectors.</p>
