            <p>     <strong> Medical Self-Care</strong>    </p>            <p>      <em>Although the subject matter of this column (which was      guest-written, for Dr. Tom. Ferguson, by two</em> Medical      Self-Care <em>staffers) is outside the areas usually      covered in MOTHER, the disease discussed is so widespread      that we welcome the chance to pass on information      concerning its treatment and prevention.</em>    </p>    <p>      Sandra Ritz and Anne Simons    </p>    <p>      The disease goes by different names-bladder      infection, cystitis, urinary tract infection, or      UTI-but the symptoms are always the same . . . and      they're agonizing. Suddenly you feel an urgent need to      urinate. When you try to do so, however, you can produce      very little, and a dreadful burning sensation rewards your      efforts. The urge returns every few minutes,too . . .      sometimes accompanied by lower abdominal pain, a low-grade      fever, chills, or blood in the urine.    </p>    <p>      Although it's certainly not fatal, cystitis is a very      uncomfortable condition, and it strikes an amazingly large      segment of the population. In fact, many authorities agree      that it's women's most common bacterial infection . . .      <em>and</em> their second most common illness overall,      occurring more frequently than any disease except colds!    </p>    <p>      The bacteria usually responsible for UTI are      <em>Escherichia</em> <em>coli</em> (commonly known as      <em>E.</em> <em>coli</em> ) . . . organisms necessary to      proper digestion which live in the intestines and bowel. In      order to cause UTI, though, the bacteria must find their      way into the urethra and then up to the bladder . . . where      they feed on urine, multiply, and cause infection. As you'd      imagine, then, bladder aliments are of primary concern to      women, because of some basic anatomical differences between      the sexes . . . that is, women's urethral and anal openings      are closer together than are men's, and their urethras are      also considerably shorter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BASIC PREVENTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Because most UTI is caused by <em>E. coli</em>      micro-organisms that have crept from the anal area into the      vagina and urethra, proper hygiene is the best way to      prevent flare-ups. Here are four basic rules a woman should      follow if she wishes to avoid a painful bout of cystitis.    </p>    <p>      [1] After eliminating, be careful to wipe from front to      back (away from the urethra), to prevent the passage of      bacteria into the bladder.    </p>    <p>      [2] Keep the vaginal and anal areas clean, preferably with      a mild, nonperfumed soap such as Ivory.    </p>    <p>      [3] Drink plenty of fluids to dilute the urine (so it will      provide less nourishment for <em>E.</em> coli) and keep the      system flushed. We recommend eight tall glasses of water a      day.    </p>    <p>      [4] Urinate frequently, at least once every two or three      hours. This will expel bacteria and eliminate the urine      they feed on.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER FACTORS</strong>    </p>    <p>      As any woman who has suffered UTI will confirm, cystitis is      more than just a minor infection: It can become an      unwelcome part of one's life. If <em>you</em> get recurrent      UTI-as 10-15% of all women do-you should      probably take steps to determine what factors might be      contributing to the situation. Possible causes include (but      aren't limited to) the following:    </p>    <p>      <em>Stress.</em> Job or family problems . . . school      pressures . . . decreased resistance due to another illness      . . . and premenstrual tension have all been known to      contribute to the onset of cystitis. A personal stress      management program (many people use meditation, yoga, or      regular exercise) may help.    </p>    <p>      <em>Lovemaking. UTI</em> has long been associated with sex.      (In fact, it's still occasionally referred to by the now      rather archaic term "honeymoon cystitis".) If you suspect      this is the cause of frequent flare-ups, discuss the      problem with your partner . . . you may want to change      styles of lovemaking or methods of birth control.      (Urinating both before and after intercourse is also a good      idea.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Underwear.</em> Choose cotton undergarments, since that      natural fabric is less irritating than are synthetic      fibers. Cotton also allows the vaginal/anal area to      "breathe", and doesn't tend to trap bacteria-attracting      heat and moisture.    </p>    <p>      <em>Menstrual products.</em> Blood is an excellent culture      medium for bacteria, so avoid its buildup by changing      tampons or sanitary napkins frequently. Also, beware of      deodorant tampons (which can cause allergic reactions) and      superabsorbent types (which expand in the vagina and can      irritate the neighboring urethra).    </p>    <p>      <em>Estrogen. As</em> the level of estrogen in a woman's      blood rises, so does her susceptibility to cystitis . . .      because this hormone makes the urinary tract more      hospitable to bacteria. Therefore, pregnant women (whose      bodies release estrogen naturally) and those who use oral      contraceptives (the pills raise estrogen levels      artificially) are especially susceptible to UTI. If you      take birth control pills and have recurrent bladder      infections, you might consider switching to lower-estrogen      pills . . . or-as mentioned before-even      choosing an entirely different contraceptive method.    </p>    <p>      <em>Perfumed Products.</em> Scented toilet paper and soap,      feminine deodorant sprays, and even bubble baths can      contribute to cystitis. In fact, the FDA recently ordered      bubble-bath manufacturers to print a cautionary label on      their products warning of possible "irritation to the skin      and urinary tract".    </p>    <p>      <em>Laundry products.</em> Bleaches, detergents, and fabric      softeners can leave residues that may cause irritation and/      or allergic reactions.    </p>    <p>      <em>Food and drink.</em> Alcohol, spicy foods, coffee, tea,      and other foods that contain caffeine-even      chocolate!-can act as irritants to the urinary tract.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FIRST AID</strong>    </p>    <p>      The onset of a bladder infection is fairly easy to      recognize, as it'll be heralded by the symptoms mentioned      at the beginning of this article. If you feel UTI coming      on, there are several things you can do that might nip it      in the bud . . . or at least reduce your discomfort until      you can get to a doctor.    </p>    <p>      Drink lots of water immediately, and <em>keep on</em>      drinking it.    </p>    <p>      Some women get relief by drinking cranberry juice, since      the acidic beverage makes urine less hospitable to      infection-causing E. coli. Others, however, find that      the juice increases the burning sensation accompanying      urination . . . and prefer to stick to water.    </p>    <p>      Urinate as frequently as possible.    </p>    <p>      Try a tea of German (not Roman) chamomile, bearberry, and      flaxseed. These herbs‚Äùwhich have been used for      centuries to treat UTI-ease the pain by relaxing the      urinary tract. (Bearberry dyes urine green, so don't be      alarmed.)    </p>    <p>      Take Pyridium. This prescription drug is a urinary      analgesic (pain killer) that will dye your urine bright      orange and take the edge off that searing pain. However, it      shouldn't be used by pregnant women or anyone with kidney      problems. If you can't get to a doctor for a prescription,      you might want to try one of the (almost equally effective)      over-the-counter urinary analgesics . . . they're most      often sold under the names Baridium or Azo-Standard.    </p>    <p>      A heating pad on the lower abdomen or a hot bath often      helps, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROFESSIONAL CARE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Of course, sometimes first aid won't work, and a visit to      the doctor's office or emergency room is necessary.      Professional treatment of a bladder infection involves      three steps: determining that there are bacteria in the      urine . . . testing their sensitivity (that is, discovering      what will kill them) . . . and then attacking with an      appropriate medication. The typical prescription for UTI is      a sulfa drug, either Gantrisin or Azo-Gantrisin. Stubborn      infections are sometimes treated with Macrodantin, a more      expensive medicine.    </p>    <p>      Some women are allergic to sulfa drugs, and black females      may develop serious anemic reactions to such medications,      so be sure to discuss those possibilities with your doctor      . . . he or she may want to prescribe ampicillin instead.      Any of the drugs used to treat cystitis will relieve the      pain quickly, but it's important to take the entire course      of medication you receive, in order to completely destroy      the bacterial strain. Remember, too, that antibiotics will      kill not only the invaders in your bladder, but also other      beneficial micro-organisms in your intestines. For that      reason, it's a good idea to eat lots of yogurt (which      replenishes the supply) while taking sulfa medication.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROBLEMS WITH DOCTORS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, many women receive unsympathetic-or      even hostile-reactions when asking their physicians      for advice on how to treat urinary complaints, because some      medical "experts" assume incorrectly that all UTI is      sex-related . . . while others consider the patient's      problem psychogenic. This is complicated by the fact that,      in many cases, bacterial counts in the woman's urine      specimen aren't high enough to be considered-by some      standards-symptomatic of a bladder infection.    </p>    <p>      Then again, recent studies have indicated that recurrent      UTI is often caused <em>not</em> by <em>E. coli</em> , but      by <em>Chlamydia,</em> a micro-organism that doesn't even      grow in urine cultures (and therefore can't be detected by      standard UTI tests). Physicians who are unaware of the      <em>Chlamydia-</em> cystitis link-and surprisingly,      quite a few are-may believe the negative test instead      of the woman and give her tranquilizers for her "imagined"      symptoms. Therefore, if <em>you know</em> you have a      bladder infection, don't accept a prescription for Valium.      Instead, inquire whether your urine specimen contained      white blood cells (which, of course, would indicate an      infection) and suggest that <em>Chlamydia</em> might be the      cause. The proper medication for such cases would be      tetracycline or erythromycin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ANATOMY CONNECTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you experience recurring UTI despite your best      preventive efforts, you <em>may</em> have an anatomical      problem in your urinary tract. This could be either an      unusual stricture (or narrowing) of the urethra,      or-more commonly-a condition called      "vesico-ureteral reflux", in which the valves between the      bladder and ureters don't close completely after the      bladder contracts to release urine. As a result,      bacteria-contaminated urine returns to the ureters, and      drops back either into the bladder to cause another UTI      or-worse yet-into the kidneys to cause a kidney      infection. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Regular cystitis      symptoms-when accompanied by high      fever-usu</em> ally <em>indicate kidney injection. If      you develop this potentially serious condition, see a      doctor right away.]</em> Physicians use a special      X-ray-called an intravenous pyelogram, or      IVP-to investigate structural problems in the urinary      tract. If such irregularities are discovered, they can      often be corrected surgically.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: This issue's column was written by the MSC      Women's Health Editor and an MSC Advisory Editor.
