                <p>            THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville,      N.C. 28791    </p>    <p>      If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us (in about 500 words) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you      started your venture. Because if your story can be fitted      into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES,      you'll receive [1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that      you helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and      [2] a free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).    </p>    <p>      My husband Ralph and I decided we wanted to be more      self-sufficient than was possible while working 9-to-5 jobs      !n a California city. So-a year ago-we packed      up our baby boy and headed for rural Idaho. We'd been      reading THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) for several years, and      the article "How to Go to Work for Yourself" (No. 52, page      36) made self-employment seem a tantalizing (and feasible)      prospect.    </p>        <p>      Ralph had nine years of custom-painting motorcycles, cars,      and boats to his credit, and he has a natural artistic      talent .. . so we scouted the area in which we hoped to      settle and found that (though there were many paint and      body shops), no one was offering airbrush, pinstriping,      lettering, and gold leaf work. We decided that a custom      paint business would be just the thing for us.    </p>    <p>      With an airbrush and some tools in our possession already,      we sold our motorcycle and invested the $1,000 that the      sale brought us in business cards and flyers . . . and      purchased the air compressor, spray guns, and paint that we      needed to start our venture.    </p>    <p>      The first six (winter) months were lean. But determined as      we were not to be forced back into the old rut, we got      together $300 and relocated our business from our garage to      a building near the center of town. There we officially      opened the doors of our shop.    </p>    <p>      Our endeavor's new home happened to be right next door to      an established paint business with a spray booth . . . so      It seemed helpful to both concerns to swap our specialized      work for the use of our business neighbor's booth. This,      and other trades with paint and body shops in the area,      allowed us to expand our capabilities and take jobs that we      couldn't otherwise have tackled.    </p>    <p>      Though our business is seasonal and even varies from week      to week (from as little as $50 to well over $1,000), the      venture is now definitely off the ground.    </p>    <p>      Ralph loves incorporating his artwork into his livelihood,      and the paperwork I do for the shop doesn't force me to      labor full time, so I can spend my spare hours playing with      my child, gardening, and engaging in the hobbies I love but      have never had time for. <em>And</em> we're almost ready to      buy some beautiful land!    </p>    <p>      Thank you, MOM, for giving us the inspiration we needed to      get where we are today.    </p>    <p>      Ralph & Debbie Finley<br />      Eagle, Idaho    </p>    <p>      In the four years since my husband Terry and I first      borrowed three issues of MOTHER from a friend, we've      developed from city-dependent, bored, frustrated people      into increasingly self-sufficient country folks. And the      success of my bootstrap business has had a lot to do with      that change.    </p>    <p>      I'd seen articles on home typing businesses in MOTHER now      and again, and they helped to get me going . . . but my      typing service is something a little different from most      and was actually the offshoot of an earlier home business.    </p>    <p>      Back in 1979, you see-when we needed extra      cash-I'd started to teach crocheting in our home. The      venture was a success, too, but it got cut short when Terry      and I moved to the Ozarks In the summer of 1980. No one      would drive up our mountainous road just to attend a      crochet class, so I decided to try a business that would      combine my teaching ability and typing skill, and that I      could conduct by mail.    </p>    <p>      I began by sending a note to the (free) readers' letters      department of a crochet magazine, offering to break      difficult patterns down into step-by-step instructions. The      letter was published last April, and in the first month I      cleared $140 (over and above the $4.00 I spent for typing      paper and the $17.50 that went to repair my tired      typewriter). By mid-June I'd earned $60 more, so I placed      an ad in another crochet magazine (it cost me $18.60) to      generate increased business.    </p>    <p>      Today, besides the fact that the demand for my written      crochet instructions is stiff growing, I've started writing      crocheted doll clothes patterns to be sold commercially ...      I've been asked to design crocheted garments for dolls ...      and one of the crafts magazines has approached me about      proofing its patterns before they go to press.    </p>    <p>      Business is so good, in fact, that I want to share the      opportunity: I believe that the field has room for more      people who can handle Instructional language and a      typewriter, as well as a crochet needle. (There also seems      to be a real need for knitting experts who can perform a      similar service.)    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, any of MOTHER's readers who'd like my assistance      can just send me $3.00 (plus a long stamped envelope) to      rewrite a pattern in step-by-step form ... or $5.00 to work      out a problem pattern and explain how to correct the      problem and complete the pattern.    </p>    <p>      Rita Neve<br />      The Crochet Cabin<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      Rt.1, Box 139<br />      Tecumseh, Mo. 65760    </p>    <p>      Last January I found myself unemployed-along with a      lot of other folks in Spokane-and before long      pounding the pavement had me pretty discouraged. That's      when I turned to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) for ideas . . .      and "You Can 'Clean Up' as a Freelance Housecleaner" (No.      47, page 46) gave me the perfect answer to my problems. You      see, not only did I actually have experience working as a      maid, but the article was even set right In my own town . .      . a fact which gave my morale a little extra boost.    </p>    <p>      I hesitated at first, though, simply because (being new to      the area) I didn't have local references. However, a few      quick calls to friends in California took care of that      problem .. . and I found that prospective customers were      happy to phone out of state to get my references.    </p>    <p>      My initial outlay totaled just $15 . . . for a one-week ad      in the local newspaper. Though my first few accounts came      in immediately, the competition was quite heavy . . . so      for a while I supplemented my income by working through a      home health care service for the elderly. And when my      housemates noticed how much our own home brightened up, I      was able to swap an afternoon's cleaning each week for a      reduced share of the living expenses.    </p>    <p>      My new enterprise allowed me to be my own boss in a      profession I enjoyed. I set my own hours, wore the clothes      I was comfortable in, and enjoyed the opportunity of      visiting people in all walks of life . . . from doctors and      accountants in expensive homes to older folks in downtown      apartments. Bus fare turned out to be my only continuing      expense . . . and many of my clients even reimbursed me for      that small travel cost. Working only 20 hours a week, I      netted an average of $75.    </p>    <p>      Thank you, MOTHER, for showing me how to turn my      out-of-a-job blues into independence!    </p>    <p>      Crissy Carey<br />      Spokane, Washington    </p>        <p>      I've always been partial to crafts that utilize free or      nearly free materials. And, living in a suburban area (I'm      not on a homestead yet), I've often marveled at what my      friends and neighbors consider to be garbage. For example,      hardly anyone here saves comhusks, but I find them very      useful.    </p>    <p>      I first foamed to make traditional comhusk dolls from a      book I checked out at the public library, and it wasn't      long before I filled the house to overflowing with charming      little ladies, gents, and youngsters. The dolls all assume      different poses and have a variety of props. They're      constructed entirely of comhusks and cotton string, and the      tools, etc., that I make for them are crafted from wood      scraps, fabric, wire .. . and more husks ($10 to $15 will      cover any and all materials I use for 30 to 40 dolls).    </p>    <p>      At any rate, when I picked up a few back issues of MOTHER      at a used book sale, I was on my way! "Get Your Crafts Into      Stores" (issue 66, page 94) gave me just the advice I      needed . .. and soon I was in the happy position of having      more orders for my little people than I could fill. I      charge $3.50 to $5.50 for each doll, and-since I can      complete three to five of them in an evening-I'm able      to bring in as much as $135 a week.    </p>    <p>      However, l now have another business as well .. I teach my      craft to scout troops, garden clubs, church youth groups,      and classes at recreation centers. Every student goes away      from the classes with a cornhusk doll he or she has made      and a new skill . . . for less than the cost of one of my      creations. On the other hand, I earn $25 for each hour      spent teaching, and sharing my methods has <em>not</em>      reduced the demand for the dolls that I make. In fact, it      has served to advertise my product and <em>increase</em> my      sales.    </p>    <p>      To order a custom-designed cornhusk doll by mail ($5.50 and      up . . . prices are negotiable, and I'll barter for      cornhusks), write me at the following address.    </p>    <p>      Linda Palter<br />      Dept.
