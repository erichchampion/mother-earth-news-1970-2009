Try . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by BARBARA JOHNSON    </h5>        <p>      What nutritious raw food cereal can be eaten as a tasty      morning breakfast, an energizing on-trail snack,      or-with the addition of fruit and yogurt-a      complete supper or dessert?<br />      <br />      Why, <em>Birchermuesli</em> , of course! And I'm going to      tell you just how to fix the tastebud-pleasing cereal      . . . but first-if you're unfamiliar with the popular      "Swiss Breakfast"-you may be wondering just how to      pronounce it! So here's an instant enunciation lesson:      Simply say BIR-ker-MEW-slee. Try again: BIR-ker-MEW-slee.      That's right. (You're now ready to sit down in a fancy      restaurant and say, "I'll have Birchermuesli,      please.")<br />      <br />      You might also wonder how Birchermuesli happened to come by      its unusual name. Well, there's a simple answer to that      question, too. <em>Muesli</em> is the Swiss word for "mush"      (which is, perhaps, a poor choice of words ... since mush      is a term most often used to describe food that's been      cooked to death!), while Bir cher comes from the name of      the doctor who-recognizing the curative powers of raw      food-created the fruit/nut/grain mixture . . . a      fellow named Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner.<br />      <br />      The physician was head of the Life-Force Sanitorium (on the      slopes of the Zurichberg outside Zurich, Switzerland) in      the late nineteenth century, and is known for his      ground-breaking work with raw food nutritional therapy.      Since the good doctor's death, both his son (Dr. Ralph      Bircher) and his daughter (Ruth Bircher-Benner, author of      <em>Eating Your Way to Health</em> , Penguin, 1973) have      continued to spread knowledge about healthful eating in      general, and the benefits of raw foods in particular.<br />      <br />      Bircher-Benner repeatedly observed-in the course of      his practice-that a diet of wholesome, uncooked foods      improved the health of many of his patients . . . even some      who were on the verge of death. The Swiss physician      attributed the restorative effects to the fact that raw      plant foods are direct products of the sun.<br />      <br />      Ralph Bircher has since claimed that the success of his      father's diet was due to the "great variety of enzymes"      contained in the uncooked foods. (Most of Bircher-Benner's      medical contemporaries, by the way, flat out rejected the      entire concept of nutritional therapy.)<br />      <br />      But whatever healthful effects the Life-Force doctor's diet      plan may have, you can be darn sure of at least one benefit      to be derived from his cereal discovery: Birchermuesli      tastes greatl In fact, whether your usual breakfast is      home-roasted granola or comes from a box in the      supermarket, I guarantee that after one dish of the Swiss      treat you'll be tempted to switch for good!<br />      <br />      Don't take my word, though . . . mix up your own batch of      basic Birchermuesli, and find out for yourself. Simply      combine 1 cup of chopped filberts ... 1 cup of chopped      almonds ... 3/4 cup of sweetened wheat germ . . . 3 cups of      quick-cooking rolled oats . . . 1 cup of dried currants (or      raisins) .. . 2/3 cup of finely chopped dried apricots . .      . and 3/4 cup or less of brown sugar (use date sugar to      taste if you prefer a less-processed sweetener). Mix the      ingredients thoroughly and keep them in a tightly lidded      container.<br />      <br />      This "basic batch" can be stored for up to a month, is made      entirely from easily obtained ingredients, and      makes-without a doubt-the ultimate campsite      breakfast food, road traveler's snack, or backpacker's      midday pick-me-up.<br />      <br />      After your Birchermuesli appetite has been whetted by the      simple mix, however, you might want to fix Apple Muesli,      one of the Swiss Breakfast's many variations. To prepare      Ruth Bircher-Benner's recipe for one serving of the fresh      fruit treat, soak 1 tablespoon of rolled oats in 3      tablespoons of water for 12 hours. (Quick-cooking      oats-soaked for only one-half hour-can be      substituted here . . . but the pre-processed flakes will be      less nutritious than old-fashioned rolled      oats.)<br />      <br />      Then, in a separate bowl, combine one tablespoon of lemon      juice with one tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk (or      with three tablespoons of yogurt sweetened with one      tablespoon of honey). Stir the ingredients together until      the mixture has a smooth and creamy texture, and add your      pre-soaked oats. Next remove the core-and any      blemishes-from a large apple, and grate the unpeeled fruit      into your bowl (stir the apple shards often as you do this,      to prevent any discoloring). Finally, sprinkle one      tablespoon of grated almonds or hazelnuts on top . .. and      dig in!<br />      <br />      You can, of course, mix Apple Muesli in      larger-than-one-serving batches, but-because it uses      fresh ingredients-this form of Swiss Breakfast will      not store well.<br />      <br />      Once you've mastered the art of fixing the basic mix and      the apple version, you'll be ready to invent your own      variations. You might try substituting wheat, rice, barley,      rye, soya, or millet flakes for the suggested oats, for      example. Or, consider replacing the dried currants and      apricots of the original recipe with dehydrated dates,      prunes, peaches, or crumbled mincemeat ... or making the      fresh fruit muesli with ripe segments of strawberries,      raspberries, cherries, peaches, apricots, or plums instead      of apples.<br />      <br />      Who knows? Perhaps you'll want to beat the Swiss at their      own game by preparing your own-inexpensive-versions      of <em>Familia or Swiss Gold</em> . (These two commercial      brands of Birchermuesli consist of combinations of oat,      apple, wheat, rye, and millet flakes . . . along with dried      raisins, wheat germ, and crushed almonds and      hazelnuts.)<br />      <br />      You can also liven up your Birchermuesli treats by serving      the food in different ways. Instead of using the standard      accompaniment of cold or hot milk (or hot water), you may      enjoy eating Swiss Breakfast with fruit juice ... yogurt      ... fresh fruit ... or whipped cream. Add bits of candied      lemon peel, or a dab of lemon juice. In fact, with just a      little ingredient imagination, you can serve Birchermuesli      as anything from a complete-and nourishing-main      course to a tasty "Swiss Sundae"!<br />      <br />      Dr. Bircher-Benner claimed that, for a person to maintain      good health, at least 50% of his or her diet should consist      of fresh raw food. And-after you discover      Birchermuesli-you may be unable to resist following      "doctor's orders"!    </p>
