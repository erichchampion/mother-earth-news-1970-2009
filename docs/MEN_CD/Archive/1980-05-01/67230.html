                <p>      The World's first solar-powered radio station is on the      air!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      EDWARD MORRIS    </h5>            <p>      Bryan, Ohio-located in the flat, northwestern corner      of the Buckeye State, 50 miles west of Toledo-is      nobody's idea of "Sun City". The area has rainy summers . .      . long, harsh winters . . . and cloud covers that manage to      look ominous even when they're <em>not</em> dropping rain      or snow.<br />      <br />      It was precisely this no-quarter-given climate, however,      that led to the decision to locate the world's first      solar-powered commercial radio station irk Bryan. The      concept's backers felt that, if the enterprise could      succeed in such an obviously "nonsolar" location, it would      be viable most anywhere. So, to prove the point, WBNO-AM (a      500-watt, dawn-to-dusk operation) transferred its      electrical allegiance from Toledo Edison to the sun on      August 29, 1979.<br />      <br />      <strong>BETTER THAN EXPECTED</strong><br />      <br />      The $300,000 experiment, which is expected to run for the      next 20 years, was designed and is being monitored by the      Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of      Technology . . . under a grant from the U.S. Department of      Energy.<br />      <br />      At the heart of WBNO's new power system is a one-third-acre      array of photovoltaic cells-33,600 of them in      all-that convert the sun's rays into direct-current      electricity. At noon on a clear day, the setup can produce      over 15,000 watts . . . far more power than the station      requires.<br />      <br />      In fact, Luke Thaman, WBNO's general manager, reports that      the early operating results have been much better than      expected. During the course of its first six days of solar      broadcasting, the station required 159 kilowatt hours. . .      while the sun-cells produced 170.<br />      <br />      In addition, significant quantities of power have been      generated, Luke says, even when the sky is partially      obscured by cloud cover and rain. Lincoln Lab's engineers      estimate that the system will furnish as much as 80% of the      station's electrical needs on a year-round basis . . .      although-at the time that this magazine went to      press-the actual amount of power provided by the      solar cells was already a full 86% of the radio station's      requirements!<br />      <br />      <strong>HOW THEY DID IT</strong><br />      <br />      The solar array beside the station is made up of seven rows      of south-facing galvanized steel racks. To minimize      shadowing, the rows are placed 12 feet apart, and the      racks-which are bolted to concrete blocks and      anchored to the ground with steel augers-can remain      stable in 100-MPH winds. The cells themselves are arranged      in modular panels of 42 each which are, in turn, bolted      onto the racks. If a single unit is damaged, the entire      module is replaced.<br />      <br />      To qualify for the project, WBNO had to install a new      solid-state transmitter, provide equipment for converting      DC electricity into AC, and build a storage room for the      monitoring machinery and the batteries that hold the      surplus power the solar cells often generate. The station      management also had to agree to make the site-and      their research findings-open to the public.<br />      <br />      Because the electrical flow from the cells varies in      strength, the system employs four large      batteries-similar to those used in diesel      locomotives-to store the excess electricity. In the      morning, before the sun is strong enough to activate the      cells, the station draws its energy from the storage units.      Fully charged, the batteries can keep WBNO broadcasting for      about a day and a half, and-when they're charged up to 90%      of their capacity-an automatic control adds on      newsroom, studio, and production room loads. If the added      drain doesn't deplete the surplus being produced, parts of      the panel array are automatically disconnected until      they're needed again.<br />      <br />      <strong>AUTOMATED PERFORMANCE</strong><br />      <br />      The system is so completely automated that it doesn't even      require on-site experts to keep it going. A 50-channel data      logger keeps track of all relevant weather and performance      information and records it on a small cassette, which is      mailed to the Lincoln Laboratory once a week for analysis.      If any part of the system malfunctions, an alarm alerts      station personnel to shut off the panels until the trouble      can be corrected. (Reverting to the station's normal source      of electricity-the local power company-is as      simple as turning a switch.)<br />      <br />      One of the big questions that still must be fully answered      is how well the solar array will function during a heavy      snow season. The designers say that the sun's relation to      the earth in winter will make the cells even more efficient      than in summer . . . and those same experts are counting on      the sun's rays (and the electrical activity within the      cells) to melt the snow before it can accumulate on the      tough polyvinyl shields that cover the modules. Although      this past winter was a mild one, WBNO's experience during      the few big snowfalls indicated that the MIT designers'      theories are correct: The snow melted away from the solar      cells-without assistance-within one to two      hours.<br />      <br />      Right now, the main drawback to the widespread use of      photovoltaic cells is their cost. Although the devices are      made primarily of silicon-an abundant element-the      cells can't be mass-produced inexpensively. <em>EDITOR'S      NOTE: That situation may be changing very soon, as revealed      by "Dollar-a-Watt Solar Electricity" in MOTHER NO. 62, page      44.1 Cell prices are quoted in terms of the watts they      produce, and the three-inch units used in the Bryan      project-priced at $14 per watt-are rated at      about one-half watt each, or $7.00 a cell.</em><br />      <br />      However, the costs are going down. The company that      supplied cells for the experimental station (Solarex, Inc.      of Rockville, Maryland) has since reduced the price to      $9.00 a watt.<br />      <br />      Finally, we're proud to say that-as befits such a      natural, sun-powered operation-WBNO is a country      music station . . . which also broadcasts MOTHER's radio      show.    </p>
