                <p>      <em>Veterinarian Randy Kidd gives you the lowdown on . .      .</em>    </p>                                <p>      If you'd like to enjoy pork that costs only pennies (not      dollars!) a pound -and tastes far better than the      plastic-wrapped meat you buy in a supermarket-you ought to      consider raising your own pigs. Just one of the chunky      critters can produce a great deal of premium, lowpriced      meat for a homesteading family . . . and the four-legged      garbage disposals can be fattened on a diet that consists      of little more than garden by-products and kitchen      leftovers!    </p>    <p>      What's more, if you begin-as many folks do-with      already weaned piglets, you'll bypass the somewhat      difficult task of hog breeding . . . and find that simply      rearing the animals is downright easy. In fact, in the      short space of the article you're reading right now, I'll      provide you with all the basic information you'll need to      produce healthy-and meaty-porkers from      purchased, pint-sized piglets.<br />      <br />      <strong>RECOGNIZE YOUR MARKET</strong><br />      <br />      You should be aware-right from the start-that      the best "marketplace" for your homegrown pork will be your      own dinner table. Of course, if you eventually "harvest"      more meat than you can use, many folks will be willing to      buy (or trade for) some of your fine-flavored victuals . .      . but there's a world of difference between bartering off a      little extra bacon and competing in the commercial      pig-raising business.<br />      <br />      A four- to eight-week-old piglet should weigh anywhere from      20 to 50 pounds and will probably cost you around $35.      (Note: This price is a very rough estimate.) If you      caretake the animal for about five months (until it weighs      200 to 220 pounds), the butchering-size critter will yield      approximately 135 pounds of "retail" meat products . . .      consisting of roughly 24 pounds of ham, 20 pounds of bacon,      17 pounds of pork roast, 18 pounds of picnic shoulder, 7      pounds of pork chops, 8 pounds of sausage, 7 pounds of      "miscellaneous" cuts, 6 pounds of salt pork, and 31 pounds      of lard. (You may also want to utilize some of the "extra"      pig parts in the form of scrapple, sweetbreads,      chitterlings, or "mountain oysters".)<br />      <br />      Be careful, though, not to raise your animal to      <em>beyond</em> that prime butchering weight of 200220      pounds. Why? Because such a "market size" hog has reached      the optimum stage of growth: Let the curly-tailed critter      get any bigger and the animal's further poundage gains will      be expensive (in terms of the feed required) and will      consist of little more than extra fat.<br />      <br />      By the way, each porker you raise to maturity will produce      a large supply of manure ( about 1.6 pounds per 100 pounds      of pig per day) for your garden, too. Of course, that kind      of productivity can be a drawback for a few wouldbe swine      raisers . . . because some communities have local      ordinances against the ever-present "essence" associated      with pig manure. (On the other hand, folks with their minds      on their gardens-and wallets-become almost      partial to piggly aromas.)<br />      <br />      <strong>BUILD YOUR ANIMAL HOUSE WELL</strong><br />      <br />      There's only one really difficult chore associated with      raising weaned piglets . . . keeping the mobile pork chops      at home. Restricting a small swine's whereabouts may sound      like a simple enough task, but Mother Nature provides each      pig with a snout that's perfectly designed for assaulting      barricades. Any fence you build will have to be strung      tighter than the fifth string on a banjo-especially      where the barrier is closest to the ground-if you      expect to keep your porkies from prying their way between      the stays.<br />      <br />      You can construct a taut welded-wire fence, a sturdy wooden      enclosure, or a two-stranded electric fence consisting of a      bottom cable six to eight inches above the turf with a      second line eight inches above that. (None of your      restrainers will need to be more than 32 inches tall,      though, because pigs can't jump very high.) You might also      want to dig a trench under your barricade and fill that      ditch with old logs or rocks . . . to discourage any      porcine tunneler's "Great Escape" plans.<br />      <br />      My own experience has convinced me that creating a truly      hog-tight fence is no easy endeavor. In fact, I spent one      entire summer chasing a batch of root-loving runaways out      of my vegetable garden. I finally gave up and bought      commercial hog panels to keep the piglets where I wanted      them. (The 16-foot, quarter-inch steel grid segments have      done the trick for me, but-at around a dollar per      running foot-such pig-stopping walls are pretty dang      expensive.)<br />      <br />      In addition to fencing, you'll need to construct a shelter      for the animals . . . and provide them with a way to cool      themselves off. Just about any three-sided, roofed house      (even an enclosure made from old hay bales, such as that      described in "Straw Barns and Other Sheds", MOTHER NO. 58,      page 42) will protect your livestock from storms and winter      winds. But since pigs don't pant very effectively-and      don't sweat at all-you'll need to be absolutely      certain each pork-producer has 15 to 20 square feet of      shade (with the shadow-making object located at least four      feet off the ground). It's also wise to provide a mud      wallow or a sprayer . . . so that any "roasting" pig can      cool off during especially sultry weather.<br />      <br />      <strong>BUY THE BEST ANIMALS</strong><br />      <br />      If you're not going to try to raise the finest quality pigs      available, you'd be better off-as far as both your      time and your wallet are concerned-not to rear any      swine at all. Of course, it may take a little practice      before you can recognize a premium porker when you see one,      but you can gain any needed instructional experience by      attending county fairs or local livestock shows, and      listening closely when the judges explain why they select      one hog specimen over another.<br />      <br />      And once you learn <em>how</em> to pick out the      best-looking pigs in a litter, do so! NEVER buy the runts      of a piglet crop-even if the offered purchase price sounds      like a bargain deal-because too many "tail enders" never      grow worth a hoot.<br />      <br />      You'll probably find that the best time to acquire a young      barrow or gilt is at the beginning of your garden's growing      season. You'll have plenty of leftover crop pickings for      the hog around then, and-in most cases-you'll be able      to expect to end up with a ready-to-eat adult pig by fall      or early winter (which, conveniently enough, is the time of      year that provides the best butchering weather).<br />      <br />      <strong>FEED YOUR CRITTERS WELL</strong><br />      <br />      Water is the most important food you can give to your      porkers ( or, for that matter, to any of your livestock). A      fattening pig guzzles as much as three gallons of liquid      per day. . . and the bacon bearers will consume a lot of      solid foods, as well. Fortunately, since the living garbage      recyclers will pack away almost anything (including      vegetables, fruits, milk, meat scraps, spoiled eggs, garden      clippings, weeds, and more), the critters can pretty well      balance their diets by themselves.<br />      <br />      Still, a 160-pound shoat can handle around 60 pounds of      such "garbage" a day, so you'll probably need to supplement      your swillswigger's diet with grain or a commercial ration      containing 20 to 25% protein (the grain also helps the pig      reduce paunchiness and produce firmer, leaner pork). In      addition, you may want to keep a steady supply of vitamin      and mineral supplements available.<br />      <br />      <strong>HELP YOUR ANIMALS PREVENT THEIR OWN      DISEASE</strong><br />      <br />      Pigs are extremely hardy beasts ( their ability to revert      rapidly to the feral state attests to this), but-like      all animals-they can get sick. A good vaccination      program will, however, prevent most illnesses: Check with      your local veterinarian so you can inoculate against the      diseases specific to your region.<br />      <br />      Since the snout-nosed beasts are continually rooting around      in their own manure, pigs have a never-ending opportunity      to acquire internal parasites. Your ground-grubbers will      need to be wormed every four to six weeks (with the      anthelmintic your vet recommends for your locale, of      course). <em>[</em> <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For more on this      subject, see Dr. Kidd 's two-part article, "How to Deal      With Internal Parasites" (MOTHER NO. 56, page 76 and NO.      57, page 56). Back issues of MOTHER are available-for      $3.00 each plus $1.00 shipping and handling per      order-from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791.]</em><br />      <br />      External parasites-like the anemia causing hog      louse-can also be debilitating, so periodically apply      a spray, a dust, or a pour-on insecticide to ward off the      blood-sucking pests (rotenone is a decent organic external      parasiticide). In our area, folks employ such treatments      every four to six weeks and then "bed down" any pigs that      will be kept over the winter with two      doses-administered three to four weeks apart after      the first killing frost-of the bug killer.<br />      <br />      <strong>AND NEXT TIME . . .</strong><br />      <br />      Well, that's that. We've covered all the basic rules for      converting healthy piglets into full-sized freezer fillers.      There are, though, a few <em>extra</em> tricks of the trade      you'll need to know if you want to rear pork from "scratch"      . . . so I'll provide information on breeding your      <em>own</em> pigs in MOTHER NO. 64.    </p>
