                <p>      <strong>Our planet's "ocean of air" just might be able to      provide all the energy your business needs.</strong>    </p>                        <p>      Four decades ago, windplants were a common sight on North      America's farms and homesteads. At present,      however-mainly because of the efforts of the Rural      Electrification Administration-the great majority of      yesterday's draft-driven pumps and generators have been      either disassembled or simply left to the mercy of the      elements.    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally, there was no real problem with the      wind-powered equipment . . . it's just that the      then-inexpensive (and freshly installed) "grid juice"      seemed to present a very attractive alternative at the      time. These days, though, the advantages of utility power      are becoming less obvious . . . and many folks, both rural      and urban (yes, breezes blow in the cities, too!), are      considering-or already have installed-their own      wind-driven power systems.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Not long ago, MOTHER sent one of her editors to      Hamburg, Pennsylvania to talk to Terry Mehrkam, founder of      the Mehrkam Energy Development Company. Terry's firm is a      small but growing operation that not only designs and      markets truly "state of the art" windpower systems, but has      actually been so successful at doing so that the demand for      MEDC-designed equipment is outstripping the present      supply.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Terry-who is best described as the firm's      designer, engineer, and part-time maintenance crew . . .      when he's not busy managing the business, that is-has      some definite opinions as to how a wind generator should be      built. The article that follows details both the Mehrkam      system and the reasons for its success.</em><br />      <br />      It should come as no surprise to anyone that countless      people are scrambling for ways around the high price of      energy . . . whether that power comes from oil, gasoline,      or public utility lines. But-in their search for a      "better way"-many folks are overlooking a      time-tested, practical alternative: the wind.<br />      <br />      One possible reason for the lack of interest in windplants      is that-in times past-the use of "air power" was limited to      areas of near-constant high winds, such as the Great Plains      or North America's coastal regions.<br />      <br />      These days, however, it's a different story. Even though      the weather hasn't changed much, the available hardware      has, and wind systems are coming into their own for several      reasons: [1] Equipment reliability has improved      substantially since the early days of windpower use. [2]      Wind-driven generation plants are becoming quite      cost-effective, and will prove to be even more so as public      power costs increase with each year. [3] Thanks to the      abovementioned advances in technology, many modern      windplants can now be utilized even during minimal wind      periods and are thus more practical than some of their fore      runners. [4] "Down time"-for regular equipment      maintenance and overhaul has been reduced to a bare-bones      minimum through sound engineering.<br />      <br />      <strong>A NEW TWIST TO AN OLD IDEA . . .</strong><br />      <br />      Since the "early" generators were, by and large, used only      in extremely windy areas, the manufacturers designed their      equipment to charge optimally at higher windspeeds (in the      neighborhood of 18 to 20 miles per hour or more) . . .      which meant that shaft RPM could range from 225 to over      900-depending on the unit-and blade tip speeds      would often approach 180 MPH!<br />      <br />      Now it doesn't take a degree in engineering to figure out      that a piece of machinery running at such speeds will      undergo severe stress . . . and that eventually the hub or      blades-or some other moving parts-may very well      fail.<br />      <br />      With this reliability problem in mind, Terry Mehrkam set      out-eight years ago-to develop a windplant that      did not incorporate a "built-in" failure potential.      Actually, the young designer had no intention of going into      the wind energy business at all. . . he was merely      searching for a way to reduce commercial power consumption      in his father's manufacturing enterprise. "We made a lot of      components for nickel plating," Terry explains,      "and-even back in 1972-were using three to four      thousand dollars' worth of electricity per year. So we were      curious about the potential of wind turbines. I      had-for years been-interested in aeronautical      theory, airplane flight dynamics, and what not . . . and I      was always a tinkerer by nature, so I designed and built my      own wind turbine: a 10-kilowatt, two-bladed      25-footer."<br />      <br />      Mehrkam's initial design attempt-though      successful-didn't quite meet his requirements,      because the machine just wasn't productive at low      windspeeds. So, soon thereafter, he built a larger      prototype, a 45-foot two-blader which would later serve as      a guinea pig for various blade designs.<br />      <br />      Not wanting to waste his time "reinventing the wheel", the      Keystone Stater researched countless technical studies . .      . in an attempt to hit upon the right type of airfoil and      blade twist for his windplant.      Unfortunately-primarily because his central      Pennsylvania location experienced only average winds most      of the time-none of Mehrkam's early blade designs      performed as well as he had expected them to. "So I decided      to try a four-blade model, and immediately found that the      additional 'arms' resulted in smoother operation . . . it      was a very passive machine when compared to the two-blader.      The idea was to have at least one blade going through one      quadrant at all times so that we wouldn't get into the      stress, flex, and dynamic frequency problems which occur in      units using fewer blades."<br />      <br />      Of course, what Mr. Mehrkam had done, in effect, was to      kill two birds with one stone: By incorporating two      additional blades into his design, he came up with a      smoother-running windplant and could shorten each blade      while still reaping the same amount of power as that      provided by the larger-span, two-bladed windplant .<br />      <br />      <strong>. . .</strong> <strong>WITH EXCELLENT      RESULTS</strong><br />      <br />      Spurred on by the obvious success of the four-blade design,      Terry took the next logical step: He added yet another pair      of airfoils to further reduce his machine's shaft speed and      to make it even more productive at low windspeeds.<br />      <br />      Again, his calculations proved correct . . . the new      six-blade model not only ran smoothly-with a minimum      of equipment stress and an easy-to-live-with 40decibel      noise level output, as measured directly below the      blades-but, even more important, charged in an unbelievably      slight breeze. (After an initial 7MPH gust-which is what's      required in order to get the machine rotating from a      standstill-the Mehrkam windplant will continue to spin in      air currents of as little as 2 MPH . . . with an effective      charge being delivered in a 5-MPH wind. An 8MPH zephyr will      produce as much as a kilowatt of power, and that figure is      increased to between three and four kilowatts as windspeeds      rise to 10-MPH.)<br />      <br />      Obviously enough, in areas where average windspeeds are not      great, an air-powered generator that can perform useful      work ail year round has something to say for itself. Terry      Mehrkam has since calculated that, under light breeze      conditions, his six-blade model is about 15% more      productive than was his own "fourfeather" design . . . and      a whole lot more efficient than conventional windplants      that might only begin to charge at 12 MPH or more!<br />      <br />      <strong>THE ECONOMIC FACTOR</strong><br />      <br />      Naturally, a breeze-powered backyard plant isn't everyone's      cup of tea (because of space limitations, nearby neighbors,      and initial costs) . . . nonetheless, anyone considering an      alternative source of power for individual (or group)      residential-or small-scale      commercial-applications should consider using the      wind.<br />      <br />      Besides the fact that MEDC's equipment can produce usable      power from very little wind independent of the public      utility grid if desired the costperkilo-watt of such a      system, installed, currently averages about $650 . . . with      some installations ( those that are used exclusively to      provide resistance heating and thus don't require      inverters, batteries, or other power-conditioning      equipment) running as low as $550 per kilowatt, all told.      When you compare such figures with the $1,000 (and greater)      cost per kilowatt of the average utility, wind-powered      electricity looks pretty good . . . not to mention the fact      that such a generating setup can earn federal tax credits,      increase the value of the property it's on, be a worthwhile      investment in itself, and sometimes enable its owner to      sell excess power back to the local utility!<br />      <br />      <strong>DESIGNED WITH</strong> <strong>DEPENDABILITY IN      MIND</strong><br />      <br />      Since Terry Mehrkam's original windplants were used to      provide complete independence from the power company      (though, to date, the majority of MEDC's customers are      hooked into the utility lines . . . for reasons of backup      convenience and/or economics), they were designed to be      low-maintenance, high-reliability pieces of      equipment.<br />      <br />      A typical MEDC turbine assembly alone comprising blades,      hub, driveshafts, transmission, generator, and exterior      nacelle-weighs in at about 4,000 pounds . . . and is, to      say the least, built to heavy-duty specifications.<br />      <br />      Besides employing an oversized, helical-geared, fully      sealed transmission-to absorb shocks better and guarantee      reliability-Mr. Mehrkam uses roller bearings      throughout each powerplant, and ties the hub to his      120-volt DC generator (or single or three-phase alternator,      depending on the buyer's requirements) with oversize      shafts, which incorporate two electrically operated disk      brakes.<br />      <br />      The blades themselves are of an extremely high-strength,      low-flex extruded aluminum design, and are either coated      with polyurethane or anodized to guarantee weather-ability.      But better yet from a standpoint of practicality-the      airfoils are mounted to the hub with special failsafe      locks, which also allow blade pitch adjustment to be made.      What this all boils down to is that each windplant can be      "custom tuned" to its own particular site . . . to provide      a high degree of efficiency throughout a wide range of      local wind velocities.<br />      <br />      The company's 7,000-pound tubular tower which will measure      anywhere from 40 to 65 feet in length on the 40-KW      windplants that MEDC markets-is constructed of 3/8"      steel and has a diameter of 30 inches. Because the design      is relatively "clean" and narrow when compared with open      frame towers, the "wake effect" of air flowing around it is      reduced drastically . . . and this, of course, adds to the      overall effectiveness of the turbine, which is positioned      downwind of the tower.<br />      <br />      High-wind flex protection is provided by internal stringers      which crisscross within the tube to a height of 20 feet      from the base . . . while the bottom of the tower is set      solidly into 20 cubic yards of buried concrete.<br />      <br />      Since the needs of Terry Mehrkam's customers vary widely,      his systems can differ with each installation. For example,      at MEDC's Hamburg, Pennsylvania test site, a DC generator      provides power-through a voltage regulator-to a series of      ten 12-volt mining car batteries. These, in turn, feed a      rotary inverter which provides 120-volt AC power to the      Mehrkam household. In many applications, the use of a      solid-state synchronous inverter has been found to be more      practical (especially in installations with a utility      company buy-back arrangement) . . . or-as in the case of      most of MEDC's clients-the generator can be replaced with      an alternator which naturally produces 120-volt AC service      and is controlled through a solid-state panel.<br />      <br />      The fact that the Mehrkam wind tur bine is essentially a      one-speed machine makes power control much easier, too.      Unlike many smaller, two-bladed windplants that work on a      proportional basis (that is, an increased speed results in      more power throughout the entire operational range), the      MEDC generator is either coming up to speed or losing speed      under normal wind conditions . . , and the optimum kilowatt      capacity of any one of the company's windplants can be set      for airspeeds of 25 to 35 MPH by adjusting the blade pitch      and the shaft speed (which can be controlled via excitation      of the generator).<br />      <br />      Once the generator is excited to the voltage output at a      given speed, it "locks onto" that RPM and shouldn't vary      more than 10% overall. Of course, if a really severe blow      should happen along, the rotor will automatically shut down      at its "redline" of 60 RPM (the result of an approximately      40-MPH windspeed), though all the turbines are designed to      withstand gusts of up to 120 MPH. Hence, in Mehrkam's      designs, greater output is obtained by increasing the      size-rather than the speed-of the blades.<br />      <br />      <strong>THERE'S A FUTURE IN WIND</strong><br />      <br />      Even though wind power isn't practical for all of us, it's      surprising just how many people could take advantage of      this inexhaustible source of energy but don't realize it.      Terry Mehrkam's rule of thumb states that a potential buyer      who is consuming at least 20,000 kilowatt hours of power      per year (and lives in a locale with an average annual      windspeed of at least 9 MPH) might well consider a      wind-driven powerplant.<br />      <br />      Terry's experience also contradicts the idea that      windplants are suitable only for rural areas. The Mehrkam      Energy Development Company has sold a good number of      machines in the past several years, and they're by no means      all set up in the boondocks. One 225-KW      installation-in fact-is located at an      Allentown, Pennsylvania amusement park, and a smaller      (40-KW) plant provides power for The Bronx Frontier . . . a      community development group located in New York City. To      date, Mehrkam has completed (or has contracted to build)      installations in other parts of New York and Pennsylvania      (where construction of a 2-megawatt unit is now in      progress), plus New Jersey, Colorado, California, and as      far away as Hawaii . . . where five plants are      scheduled.<br />      <br />      In all, the prospects of Mehrkam Energy Development      Company-and windpower in general-look great ...      and as the cost of conventional (and often      nuclear-generated) power continues to rise, their future      should become that much brighter.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If the prospect of reaping electrical power      from the wind piques your interest, Terry Mehrkam does have      available an owner's manual and information      pamphlet-complete with specifications and a price      list for all his models-for $8.00, postpaid.
