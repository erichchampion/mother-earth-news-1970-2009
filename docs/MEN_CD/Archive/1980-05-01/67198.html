        <p>The butler's tray table was designed hundreds of years ago . . . no doubt to make it easy for "the help" to deliver milord and milady's teatime victuals. It was, after all, a simple matter to load the removable tray with goodies in the kitchen, and then deposit it-atop its waiting legs-before a hungry group of nobles.</p><p>Even today, in our self-serve society, antique reproduction butler's tables are often found in American households. And, when you think about it, the convertible furnishings actually have dozens of potential uses . . . from serving breakfast in bed to transporting bowls of midnight popcorn. What's more, we believe you'll find that MOTHER's mini-mobile groaning board is an uncomplicated but satisfying shop project . . . as well as a treat for the eyes!<br /><br /><strong>KEEP THE COST DOWN</strong><br /><br />Money-wise woodworkers buy large boards and divide them . . . instead of paying the added board-footage charge for cut-to-size lumber. For example, if you're willing to rip two eight-foot 1 X 8's as shown in the cutting diagram, you can avoid the additional expense of having to buy <em>two</em> (closer-to-size) 1 X 4's plus one 1X8.<br /><br /><strong>TAKE IT FROM THE BOTTOM</strong><br /><br />The table's legs and braces are held together by 5/16" X 1-1/2" fluted dowels. (NOTE: Since the wooden pegs enter the corner posts from two different directions, the 3/4"-deep holes must be "stag gered" or the pairs of plugs will run into each other.) The dowels should be glued into the holes, and the contact surfaces <em>between</em> the boards must also be bonded. Once all the pieces are glued and slipped together, apply pressure to the assembly with either four bar clamps or a strap clamp. (A tip: If you have trouble keeping the legs square, just tack thin strips of wood-such as split lath or 1/4" dowel - between the feet to hold them in position until the adhesive has set.)<br /><br /><strong>AND CONTINUE ON TOP</strong><br /><br />The holes for the 1/4" X 1-1/4" fluted doweling-which holds the various parts of the table's <em>top</em> together-must be very carefully aligned, or the ends of the boards won't square up. So, before you do any drilling, lay out the various sections and mark them . . . allowing for two dowels in each long dimension and one in each of the shorter sides.<br /><br />Start assembling the tray section by joining two 6-1/4" X 10-1/4" boards with a 2" X 10-1/4" section between them. Now secure a 2" X 14-1/2" segment to each side of the three-piece unit. Then construct another three-board assembly, attach it to the already assembled five-piece por. tion, and affix the last 2" X 14-1/2" plank to your platform's "unoccupied" edge. Complete the tabletop by adding the 2" X 26-1/2" side boards, and clamp the assembly securely while the glue dries.<br /><br />Once the bonder has set sufficiently, remove the clamps and lay the joined boards upside down on your workbench.<br /><br />Position the base unit, legs up, on the top (leaving about 1/4" space all around) and scribe a line-on the underside of the platformaround the inside of the base's boards. Then, using leftover scraps of wood, make 3/4" X 1" X 2" cleats and fasten them along the pencil line with wood screws . . . two to each corner. (These pieces will prevent the top from sliding on the base, while still allowing for its easy removal.<br /><br /><strong>HANDLES</strong><br /><br />One simple way to form an accurate curve for the foldup handles is to make a template from a piece of cardboard. Cut out one 3-1/2" X 18-1/2" chunk of the paper product and another that's 3-1/2" X 26-1/2" . . . and fold each one in half end to end. Once you slice out a suitable curve on both templates, the unfolded cardboard pieces will provide symmetrical arcs.<br /><br />To make the hand grips just locate the center of each board's long dimension, move in 1-1/4" from the curved side, and bore a 1" hole. Drill another 1Â° opening on each side of the centered one, then file out the rest of the finger slot with a rasp.<br /><br /><strong>FINISHING</strong><br /><br />Attach the handles to the tabletop with four pairs of brass hinges (the locking type is best), sand the wood to an even surface, apply a coat of polyurethane varnish, and rub the whole thing out with 0000 steel wool. Now you're ready for some high-class serving . . . don't forget the white towel and ice bucket!</p>
