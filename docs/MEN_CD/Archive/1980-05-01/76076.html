SNYDER, <em>International Money line</em> , 25      Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, 24 issues a      year/$213: "If there is anything certain about the 80's, it      is that the outlook is extremely uncertain. The German      Chancellor Helmut Schmidt put this into the most succinct      (and safest) forecast when he said, 'Nothing will be the      same in the 80's as it was in the 70's . . .      nothing."'<br />      <br />      ALEX HERBAGE, <em>IMAC Economic Newsletter</em> , CAPRIMEX      SERVICES, CAPRISERV SA, 100 rue du Rhone, Case Postale 235,      1211 Geneva 3, Switzerland (subscription rates on request),      on the Russian invasion of Afghanistan: "Now we shall pay      the price for our continued weakness and lack of vigilance      that has resulted from the shameful sale of advanced      Western technology to the Soviet nation and its satellites.      Truly we have been handing over the rope from which the      noose will be fashioned with which Moscow hopes to hang the      West. To boot, and to add a dreadful irony to this tragic      scenario, we have willingly lent the Communist East the      money and the credits with which to purchase our      technology, thus helping to undermine our own financial and      economic stability."<br />      <br />      IDA COX, 30's blues singer: "When you lose your money,      don't you lose your mind."<br />      <br />      ALEX HERBAGE, <em>IMAC Economic Newsletter</em> .      "Confrontation will be the key word of the 80's. Nation      against nation, devel oped world against the emerging      nations. Worker against boss,. politician against      politician. The world is stirring whether we like it or      not. The established order is being challenged by a spirit      of revolution and unrest that is rife in the world today.      On a global scale, we are now experiencing the fears that      must have been felt by the aristocrats and landed gentry      when they heard the swish of Madame Guillotine for the      first time during the French Revolution. We could all learn      more by studying history, and the events of those momentous      years at the end of the 18th Century are in many ways      parallel to those we are experiencing today. Then-as is      happening now-the established order was challenged and a      new epoch entered."<br />      <br />      RICHARD RUSSELL, <em>Dow Theory Letters, Inc.</em> , P.O.      Box 1759, La Jolla, California 92038, 26 or more letters a      yearly/$150: "My feeling is that the 1980's are going to be      the years in which Americans finally have to face      realities. What are these realities? [1] Russia, with the      sacrifice of her economy, is now military leader of the      world. [2] The U.S., over its head in debt, is going to      have to sacrifice a good chunk of its domestic economy if      it wants to remain a free power. [3] The current U.S.      concepts of government spending, transfer payments,      consumerism, [and] deficit spending are going to be revised      drastically. They're going to HAVE to be revised. [4] For      25 years U.S. Presidents have been blathering about      "sacrifices" the American people will be called upon to      make. So far, the so-called sacrifices (whatever they are)      have been minimal to non-existent. In the 80's real      sacrifices will have to be made."<br />      <br />      TIMES OF LONDON, December 12, 1979 editorial: "The forces      which have knocked the dollar down against gold are far      stronger at the beginning of the 1980's than they were at      the beginning of the 1970's. The world shortage of oil, the      competition faced by American industry, the rate of      inflation in the United States, all undermine the dollar      now in a way they did not ten years ago. It would be      difficult to find any plausible argument for supposing that      gold will weaken in dollar terms in the 1980's."<br />      <br />      RICHARD RUSSELL, <em>Dow Theory Letters</em> , Inc.: "In      1960 the U.S. Federal budget was just under $100 billion.      By 1970 the Federal budget was just over $200 billion. Here      in 1980 the budget will be over $600 billion! But this is      the true horror: I estimate that the interest, THE      INTEREST, on the Federal budget this year will be around      $80 billion ... [and that) the U.S. will be paying about      $100 billion next year [just] to carry its debt! That      amounts to $2 billion a week. Ever hear of a nation being      eaten up alive by debt and deficits? You're looking at      it.<br />      <br />      "This whole process is the road to economic disaster. An      accelerating debt and accelerating interest on the debt      allow of only two choices: [1] rocketing inflation in which      the debt is 'reduced' by destroying the currency in which      the debt is denominated, or [2] deflation, depression, and      potential bankruptcy."<br />      <br />      R.E. McMASTER, JR., <em>The Reaper</em> , P.O. Box 39026,      Phoenix, Arizona 85069, 47 issues a year/$225: "Interest on      the Federal debt is now $85,000 per minute. Such debts have      never been paid off in the history of world governments . .      . [also] the interest [alone] on the Federal debt is      expected to reach $100 billion between 1982 and 1983. One      hundred billion dollars is the net capital generating      ability of the U.S. economy. In other words, between 1982      and '83, all capital generated will go to pay just the      interest on the Federal debt."<br />      <br />      RICHARD RUSSELL, <em>Dow Theory Letters, Inc.</em> : "The      U.S. Government is the biggest . . . borrower . . . in      world history . . . [and sells] ... $14 billion . .. in      15-year bonds annually. These bonds are sold at auction      against all bidders. Whatever interest .. . it takes to      sell these bonds . . . that's what they go for!<br />      <br />      "Yields on U.S. Government long-term bonds are moving to      the 13% rate now (February 27, 1980). At 13%, money      QUADRUPLES in a little over 11 years! Do you understand      what this means? Suppose institutions put their assets into      bonds yielding 13%. That means they will be guaranteed to      quadruple their assets by 1991. Where would the money come      from to provide this kind of return? You say from      inflation? Great, but inflation demands even higher      interest rates, and higher interest rates produce an even      greater rate of return, and even more money is needed to      service the debts. And so on . . . until      destruction."<br />      <br />      JULIAN M. SNYDER, <em>International Moneyline</em> :      "'Americans are just beginning to realize that the fight      against inflation is a hopeless cause,' Hans Bar, Chairman      of Bank Julius Bar, told us. 'You can't have thirty-year      bonds anymore. Long-term money is on the way out.'<br />      <br />      "As Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers points out, the end      of long-term financing will reduce the final liquidity of      the banking system, since a great deal of it depends on      corporations' being able to borrow long in the bond markets      to pay off bank debt. This could hamper the next period of      expansion in the economy, since one prerequisite for      expansion is an improved liquidity base (improved balance      sheets). Public utilities will be particularly hard hit,      since their long-term borrowing requirements are      astronomical. Insurance companies and pension funds would      also be seriously hit and their long-term capacity to pay      benefits severely impaired.<br />      <br />      "Inflation is the kind of reduction gear that systemically      destroys long-term credit and contracts of all      kinds."<br />      <br />      RICHARD L. LESHER, President of the U.S. Chamber of      Commerce: "Even as government's deficit spending fuels the      inflation that destroys the fixed values of private      pensions, government officials are protecting themselves at      your expense. They are committing your tax dollars to index      their own pensions to the rate of inflation. And since      Federal workers can retire earlier, inflation and time      could compound those benefits beyond belief. Twenty years      from now, retired Federal clerks could be receiving annual      incomes of $100,000."<br />      <br />      JIM McKEEVER, <em>McKeever's Individual Survival Strategy      Letter</em> , P.O. Box 4130, Medford, Oregon 97501, 20      issues a year/ $165: "People have no concept of the      incredible implications of a 20-25% inflation rate . . .      [but] if the inflation rate averaged 25% per year between      now and the year 2000, for every $1,000 per month in      expenses that you have today, the same amount of      expenditures would cost you $86,735 each month in the year      2000. It a loaf of bread costs 70 cents today, It would      cost $63.00 then. A suit of clothes that costs $200 today      would cost $18,000 .... Similarly, if today you are making      $50,000 per year you would have to be earning $4,500,000      annually in the year 2000 just to break even!"<br />      <br />      GARY NORTH, <em>Remnant Review</em> , P.O. Box 35547,      Phoenix, Arizona 85069, 22 issues a year/$60: "Consider the      30 pieces of silver Judas received. Assume that they were      the size of dimes. If he had invested his $3.00 (pre-1965      price of silver, of course) at 3% interest in the first      week of A.D. 30, and his heirs went down to the bank to      pull out the money at the end of 1979 (a total of 1,950      years invested), the account would now total . . . 31      septillion, 400 sextillion dollars.<br />      <br />      If everyone on earth (4 billion people) got an equal share,      each person would inherit seven quadrillion, eight hundred      fifty trillion dollars. "Here's another one. If the present      world population of 4 billion people were to continue to      grow at 1 % per annum-far lower than world population is      presently growing-in 1,000 years the total would be 83.8      trillion people.<br />      <br />      "What we have to face is simple enough: The present growth      rates that the West's economies sustain today, or have      sustained over the past two centuries, simply will not      continue over an indefinite period of time .... It is      categorically, mathematically, impossible to maintain      economic growth at 6% or 5% or even 3% for centuries on      end.<br />      <br />      "Politically, no government economist can admit this. The      politics of the 20th Century are committed to compound      economic growth, or as Robert Nisbet [says], `liberalism      plus 6%'. Of course, no serious economist would maintain      that such growth can go on indefinitely. But the      overwhelming majority insist that it can go on for another      few decades, or a decade, or at least until they      retire.<br />      <br />      "The leaders of the world are committed to the pursuit of a      demon. The corporate executives, if they are to stay in      power inside their firms, are also committed to pursuing      this same . . . demon. They will beg, borrow, and steal      money-taxpayers' money-to stay in business and keep the      compound growth demon going. In the final analysis, it is      the public at large-the voting public, the stock-buying      public, the pressuregroup publicthat has adopted the      ideology of endless compound growth .... This ideology has      doomed the dollar. It has doomed the international monetary      system. The numbers don't lie. Economists do."<br />      <br />      SOMERSET MAUGHAM: "If a nation values anything more than      freedom, it will lose its freedom. And the irony of it is      that if it is comfort or money that it values more, it will      lose that too."<br />      <br />      RICHARD RUSSELL, <em>Dow Theory Letters, Inc.</em> : "The      U.S. wasn't satisfied with just a free lunch. We've lived      on a free sevencourse dinner which lasted from 1945 to the      present. But the markets know that there are no free      lunches and damn sure no free seven-course perpetual      dinners. So we wrecked the great "good as gold" dollar to      pull off the magic, and now we're being exposed for the      dollar creditors of the world to see.<br />      <br />      "From this point on, it's going to get harder. We're losing      out on the economic front, the geo-political front, and the      military front. We're spent up and pooped out, and suddenly      the crises are beginning to hit. And that's what the gold      and silver move is all about."<br />      <br />      GARY NORTH, <em>Remnant Review</em> : "My conclusion [about      gold and silver] in 1965 .. . [was] simple: Buy and hold      ... I never tried to beat the market. I simply bet against      Western Civilization, year in and year out. I shorted the      20th Century. So far, I'm ahead."<br />      <br />      GARY NORTH, <em>Remnant Review</em> : " <em>The issue is      personal freedom, not the price of gold</em> . The price of      gold is a very good indicator of the market for freedom-the      higher the price, the less the domain of freedom-but the      really important issues are political, not economic. If you      allow yourself to become hypnotized by rapidly rising or      falling dollar-denominated prices for pieces of metal, then      you will probably make some disastrous decisions, such as      selling off your gold in order to buy back in later at a      really good price. Gold should not be regarded as a means      of increasing your holdings of paper money. <em>Gold should      be</em> <em>regarded as an admission ticket to the free      market during a future period of bureaucratic      tyranny."</em><br />      <br />      R.E. McMASTER, JR., <em>The Reaper</em> : "A free man must      reconcile himself to the fact that he will eventually      involuntarily break establishment law. He must resign      himself to the validity of a higher law (God's law), and      that of the U.S. Constitution. Even now, nearly all of us      are in violation of some law. We could hardly be otherwise.      Fifty thousand pages a year are added to the Federal      Register, the law of the land. Then there are all the      `alphabet agency' Rules and Regulations. The number of laws      created in the last two and a half years (approximately) is      greater than the number of laws created from the beginning      of the country up until the past few years."<br />      <br />      JULIAN M. SNYDER, <em>International Moneyline</em> : "Big      Brother knocked on the door the other day. Five weeks after      our `Smoking Gun' issue about David Rockefeller's role in      influencing the Carter Administration relative to the      Iranian crisis and 23 days after David Rockefeller's      resignation as Chief Executive Officer of the Chase      Manhattan Bank, two nice gentlemen from the Securities and      Exchange Commission dropped in on a `routine'      investigation.<br />      <br />      "Agents Jack Lustig and Don Jennings were quite friendly to      the staff, but when they sat down with the editor behind      closed doors, some of the friendliness evaporated. In the      outer office, an agent from the IRS was auditing our      books.<br />      <br />      'Where did you get the money to start this business?'      Jennings wanted to know among other things. Such a      question, in the opinion of our attorney, indicated that      the investigation was not just `routine'. Lustig handed us      a piece of paper that stated: 'It is mandatory that      accounts, correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, and      other documents and records of the above required to be      made and/or preserved must be made available for inspection      . . .'and that: "'The Commission's principal purpose in      soliciting the information is fact-gathering in order to      determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or      is about to violate any provision of the Federal securities      laws . . .'and that: "<br />      <br />      `A willful failure to permit inspection by authorized      Commission personnel of the documents specified above may      result in a conviction and a fine of not more than $10,000      or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, except      that when the person failing to permit inspection is a      national securities exchange, a fine not exceeding $500,000      may be imposed . . . .'<br />      <br />      "Maybe someone was sending us a valentine .... However, the      outrageous assault of the SEC on Colonel Edward C. Harwood      of American Counselers Institute (ACI) of Great Barrington,      Mass., the recent action of the New York Attorney General's      office against James Dines, and the jailing of Canadian      gold bug Vern Myers provide cause for a certain amount of      real concern. Certainly, such attacks are not the hallmarks      of a free and open society."<br />      <br />      GARY NORTH, <em>Remnant Review</em> : "By 1982, at the      latest, the U.S. will enter the most dangerous period in      its history."<br />      <br />      IRVING KRISTOL, in his November 26, 1979 <em>Wall Street      Journal</em> Editorial Page article entitled "The Worst Is      Yet To Come": "The 1980's have already begun. They began      with the takeover of the American embassy in Tehran earlier      this month and with the subsequent confrontation between      the United States and a virulently anti-Western Iranian      regime. This episode is . . . the shocking prologue to an      equally tense drama that stands poised to unfold in the      decade ahead. It promises to be an absolutely ghastly      period.<br />      <br />      "The 1980's will see a disintegrating international order      in which economic growth is going to be extraordinarily      difficult to achieve, and in which even economic stability      will be hard to maintain. It will therefore have to be an      overriding goal of American foreign policy to help shape      this world so that the growth of the world economy can      continue. This will require many sacrifices, but so long as      the goal is visibly there, the sacrifices are tolerable. If      the goal is not there, our situation will gradually      deteriorate until we end up divided among ourselves and      destroying our institutions in a frenzy of      recriminations.<br />      <br />      "Where will such a foreign policy come from? Who will      articulate it? Who will be able to sustain it? Those are      the questions that ought to be dominating the 1980      elections. But no one, so far as I can see, is asking      them."<br />      <br />      RICHARD RUSSELL, <em>Dow Theory Letters</em> , Inc.: "Many      people wonder why Europe is not jumping to aid the U.S. in      its belated `born-again' struggle against Russian      aggression .... If you wonder, then mull over these items:      West Europe received 7% of its natural gas in 1979 from      Russia (Austria received 50%). Russia supplies 35% of all      enriched uranium to Europe. About 40% of European coal      imports come from Russia and Poland. About 5% of European      oil comes from Russia (Italy gets 10% of its oil from      Russia). At least 60% of the hard currency debt owed by      Russia to Western banks is owed to European banks. Are you      beginning to get the idea?"<br />      <br />      DAVID WITTS, Dallas lawyer and former member of the Texas      Railroad Commission, in a confidential memo to Yiji Sawano,      president of the Naigai Trading Company in Tokyo and quoted      in the February 1, 1980 issue of To The Point: "The energy      era is what I call the decade ahead. Decisions will pivot      on energy . . . its availability and its cost. The      post-World War Two Period will fall apart, as its policies      become irrelevant. What is relevant will be energy . . .      and the power to seize it, develop it, and use it.<br />      <br />      "When the guard is changed in the Kremlin, they will not      have been brought up in an era of Western military      superiority. They will be confident, having authored the      power shift. They will be bold.<br />      <br />      "For 1,400 miles Russia borders Iran, openly coveted by      them since the reign of Peter the Great. The Tudeh      Communist Party dominates Iran's oil workers. Pipelines now      carry Iranian gas and oil to Russia. The Soviets will      require substantial oil imports by 1982. They outflank Iran      on all sides. They can send in the Afghans or Iraqis as      surrogate forces to take over, just as they used the Cubans      in Ethiopia, Angola, and South Yemen. Or they could use      their own troops now in Afghanistan.<br />      <br />      "This would give Russia control of the entire Persian Gulf.      They already dominate the Straits of Hormuz. When this      happens, the Russians will reverse the oil flow to the      Soviet bloc. This will occur whenever the Soviets feel the      current charade has gone on long enough. They don't want to      risk serious damage to the oil installations."<br />      <br />      R.E. McMASTER, JR., <em>The Reaper</em> . "Dr. Raymond H.      Wheeler . . . who created the Drought and Civil Warfare      Clock, stated, 'The present 500-year cycle is due to end      around 1980.' Wheeler felt that where we are presently in      the cycle is where governments break down and nations      collapse! Along with this breakdown there occurs a wave of      international wars, nation-felling wars, and these wars      give way to civil strife and revolution.<br />      <br />      "Fundamentals are confirming Wheeler's cyclic research.      Expect the next major economic downturn in the 1980's to      result in civil unrest and a resulting decline in      government power. The inevitable result will be war."<br />      <br />      R.E. McMASTER, JR., <em>The Reaper</em> . "Between now and      1985, we not only need to be concerned about the      destruction of our monetary system through runaway      inflation and a subsequent depression, but we need to focus      on the more serious threat of devastating earthquakes and      accompanying worldwide wars and revolutions."<br />      <br />      WILLIAM IRWIN THOMPSON, on page 125 of his book,      <em>Darkness and Scattered</em> <em>Light</em> : "The Maya      with their sacred calendar calculated the positions of the      stars back in time for millions of years .... They had      learned to live with such an extended sense of meaning that      time for them wasn't simply the next meal, but the next      concert of the stars and the planets .... For the Long      Count of the Maya, human time expresses itself in a      5,124-year cycle; there are 5,124 years of savagery, then      5,124 years of civilization. The period of civilization      began for them in 3113 B.C. and will end at midnight on      December 24. A.D. 2011.

McMASTER, JR., <em>The Reaper</em> : "What does one      do? Geographic separation from the cities is considerable      help. Absence makes the government's heart grow fonder for      someone else's pocketbook, assets, and freedom. Diversity      of assets internationally with holdings in Caribbean tax      havens, Switzerland, and London is recommended. Diversity      of assets domestically into gold, cash, income-producing      real estate, farms, commodities, homes, and important      retail businesses such as hardware stores is helpful. These      should be in different geographic locations, preferably out      of the major cities.<br />      <br />      "Gold and silver are survival money. They should be held      for such use. Home self-sufficiency, by way of solar or      wood heating, a garden, greenhouse, and food storage, also      makes sense. One must hedge one's bets. We live in the age      of uncertainty. There is no other way to survive      intact."<br />      <br />      GARY NORTH, <em>Remnant Review</em> : "Gold and silver got      away from you, right? Even if you had some, it wasn't      enough. You didn't have 75% of your investments in gold or      silver a year ago. You suspected something like this would      happen, but not this fast. You intended to get ready. You      really wanted to buy more coins. Next time, you say, next      time. You will be ready next time. NOW IS NEXT TIME.<br />      <br />      "You should now rethink your strategy of 'chasing metal'.      Yes, I think you should buy some [silver] dimes, some small      gold coins, and even some diamonds if your net worth is      high enough. (But) the ground floor (in those investments)      is long gone. Now you have to find other ground floors . .      . Used guns [for instance] are still cheap (in this      country). And when the evening news tells us that in Iran      and Afghanistan a bullet costs a dollar, we had better      understand why. If you are looking for a surefire      investment, buy .22 long rifle ... .45, .357, .38, .30.06      (rifle), and .308 (rifle) cartridges and weapons. I am      talking about investing. A .38 caliber pistol and 100      bullets for it will serve as major barter items by the late      1980's if there isn't a war, and by 1982 if there is      nuclear war."<br />      <br />      THE STRAIGHT SKINNY ON INVESTMENT DIAMONDS. At one time or      another we've all heard of how this or that family escaped      Nazi Germany or Communist Cuba or wherever by converting      its wealth into diamonds, sewing the stones into the      children's coats, and catching "the last boat out". It's      also common knowledge that, recently, diamonds have      skyrocketed in value right along with gold, silver, and      platinum. What most of us don't know, however-even if we      have the money to invest-is how to guarantee that any      diamonds we buy are indeed investment' grade gems and that      we've purchased them at the "right" price (no more than      wholesale plus a broker's commission of, say, 5% to      7%).<br />      <br />      How are diamonds graded anyway? And what is today's actual      wholesale price for a quality stone? The man with the      answers to these questions is Mr. Martin Rapaport, Rapaport      Diamond Corporation, 30 West 47th Street, New York, New      York 10036. Martin (Mike, to his friends) publishes a      concise one-page set of instructions that - almost      instantly-can teach you how to read a Gemological Institute      of America (GIA) diamond certificate with authority. He      also distributes other useful information, including an      interesting chart which graphs the "average" price of      investment-grade stones against the New York Comex      per-ounce value of gold.<br />      <br />      <em>But most important of all</em> , Mr. Rapaport prints      and mails a weekly summary of the current spot wholesale      prices for the top 120 grades of investment diamonds (Round      D/FL through K/VS2 1.00 to 1.40 carat, Round D/FL through      K/VS2 0.48 to 0.64 carat, and Round D/FL through K/VS2 0.70      through 0.79 carat) plus conversion factors for marquise,      heart, and other fancy cuts.<br />      <br />      Now this is the Genuine Article: a weekly update of actual      wholesale investment-grade diamond prices from around the      country and, most especially, from the New York City      diamond market (quite possibly the most important in the      world).<br />      <br />      The weekly Rapaport Diamond Report will cost you $100 a      year. But if you're a diamond dealer or a serious investor      in diamonds (the only folks eligible for subscriptions to      the service), you're certain to find that modest cost      returned many, many times over during the coming 12 months      . . . and probably during your very next gem transaction.      This is real "insider's" information that, at least to this      writer's knowledge, simply is not available anywhere else      at any price at all.<br />      <br />      GARY NORTH, <em>Remnant Review</em> : "Anyone who has read      The Gulag Archipelago knows how seemingly incoherent and      random the operations of tyrannical bureaucracies really      are. Those who escaped getting shoved into the labor camp      system were able to do so by acting fast, by staying out of      the way of the authorities, by offering bribes, and by      disappearing at critical moments .... Ultimately the      bureaucratic hierarchies . . . are not fully coordinated.      Understand this, and you can take effective steps to avoid      the consequences of unbridled bureaucratic expansion.<br />      <br />      "Invest in yourself, your family, and your tools. The best      investment will be mobile, liquid, immediately usable in      producing real (not monetary) income, and not worth      confiscating.<br />      <br />      "A rototiller (for example) is an immensely useful item for      home gardening. But what good is one for a multinational      agribusiness company? What value would it have on a      large-scale farm? A modern tractor is something else      again.<br />      <br />      "If you have 200 light bulbs in storage, what will it cost      the State to search them out and confiscate them? It is      quite easy to imagine a day when the State will simply      confiscate (by purchasing at controlled, below-market      rates) half the output of GE's light division. That gets      the State more bulbs for the buck. But how much will the      bureaucrats have to spend on locating and collecting your      hoard of bulbs? Too much, I suspect."<br />      <br />      L.T. PATTERSON, <em>The L.T. Patterson Strategy</em>      <em>Letter</em> , Patterson Publishing Company, P.O. Box      37432, Cincinnati, Ohio 45237, 12 issues a year/$149.95:      "Some will prefer to stock up on . . . goods in advance,      including such items as cigarettes, light bulbs, coffee,      sugar, liquor, and so on. My recommendation is that      [silver] coins will be more important since they are freely      exchangeable . . . and each [one of my readers] should      invest in a total of $1,000 face value pre-1965 coins (one      bag) at this time (as a minimum) ... 50% in nickels, 25% in      dimes, 15% in quarters, and 10% in halves .... I recommend      you deal with U.S. Paper Exchange [at] 1129 Washington      Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55415 ...

Those who have not yet purchased their dehydrated foods      should do so now."<br />      <br />      GARY NORTH, <em>Remnant Review</em> : "The government is      actively inflating. We must be actively evading .... If the      (rise in] price of [the goods we need] exceeds the return      on conventional investments, then why don't people just      sell their conventional investments and buy the      goods?<br />      <br />      "A person may have $50,000 investment capital. Why not take      $25,000 of it and buy those durable goods that he or she      expects to consume over the next five or ten years and      store them? Why not buy all the light bulbs, kitchen      utensils, consumable durables, paper products, frozen beef,      frozen food, dehydrated food, new clothes or fabrics,      sewing machine, thread, and so forth? Buy and store ....      Pay a year in advance (ask for a 10% discount, of course)      .... There is the theft problem [of course], but inflation      is a more certain form of theft.<br />      <br />      "If a person is going to speculate-that is, deal with the      uncertain future-it's a safer bet to speculate against      money and for goods."<br />      <br />      ALEX HERBAGE, <em>IMAC Economic Newsletter</em> . "The      general level of public interest in high flying forms of      speculation should be taken as a serious sign of warning on      the wall. Such abandonment by the general public of prudent      saving practices replaced with uninformed speculation has      always been an indicative sign of the last blowoff before a      major economic crash occurs."<br />      <br />      RICHARD RUSSELL, <em>Dow Theory Letters, Inc.</em> : "One      thing I have been wondering about is the general consensus      that 'there will be no recession, or perhaps a very mild      recession in 1980'. Frankly I wonder if (after being held      off for years) there won't be a stiff recession starting      this year. If so, we could see `the big fooler' . . . [a]      contrary opinion shocker [which] might be [11 a tumbling      stock market, (2] a collapse in gold, [3] a big rally in      bonds. And ultimately, a rush to CASH (for liquidity      purposes), since the banks, business, and the public are      all extremely illiquid at this time.<br />      <br />      "Remember, `everyone' is now borrowed up, loaded with      collectibles, very low on savings, and ready for more 'fun      and inflation'. What a perfect setting for the markets to      put on `the big squeeze'. And the big squeeze could be a      pressing need for CASH, the one thing that nobody has at      this time.<br />      <br />      "Up to now, cash and credit (borrowing power) have      practically become synonymous. But they are not synonymous.      Cash and credit may be 'about the same' when confidence is      riding high. When things get rough, however, the cash you      have is still cash. But the credit spigot can be turned      off. At that time, many will find that cash and credit are      most definitely NOT the same thing."<br />      <br />      TOM BURKE, Friends of the Earth, quoted by Jeremy Sea-brook      in his book, What Went Wrong? and requoted by Gary North's      Remnant Review: "The new wealth might count as affluent the      person who possesses the necessary equipment to make the      best use of natural energy flows to heat a home or warm      water . . . the uses which account for the bulk of an      individual's energy demand.<br />      <br />      "The symbols of this kind of wealth would not be new cars,      TV's or whatever, although they would be just as tangible      and just as visible. They would be solar panels, insulated      walls, or a heat pump. The poor would be those who remained      dependent on centralized energy-distribution services,      vulnerable to interruption by malfunction, sabotage, or      strike ... and even more vulnerable to interruption by      inaccessible technocrats, themselves the victims of market      forces beyond their control.<br />      <br />      "The new rich would boast, not of how new their television      was, but of how long it was expected to last and how easy      it would be to repair. Wealth might take the form of      ownership, or at least access to, enough land to grow a      proportion of one's food .... The role of the State would      change as it became less important as a provider of      services. The relationship between a person and his job      would change as the importance of non-financial      transactions grew."    </p>
