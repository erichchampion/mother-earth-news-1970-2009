                    <p>      <strong>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Inc., P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791</strong><br />      <br />      In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of mankind's better ideas-barter-and offered      up an interesting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing      feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said      Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for      contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied      ... and announced our still standing offer: Anyone (and      that means you!) who sends us a short (200 words or less)      account of an actual barter that's good enough to print      will receive-as the folks on the following page      have-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of      same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .<br />      <br />      "How soon can I run a chain saw?" I asked the surgeon as he      probed my hand for the ends of the cut thumb tendons.      And-in the next breath-added, "Would you consider barter?"      To my surprise, he replied affirmatively . . . while joking      that it was a good thing I hadn't used my sharp axe. Later,      as I was leaving (literally "in stitches"), we agreed on      several hardwood scoops, four deer-bone crocket hooks, and      a cord or two of firewood as "payment" for the doc's      medical skill.<br />      <br />      My new dentist was willing to do some trading, too. (At a      military base in Alaska, he'd swapped with the Eskimos . .      . fillings for fresh moose meat!) So, with gleaming teeth,      the whole family pitched in to deliver several loads of      cordwood and some houseplants to the specialist's home.      And-best of all-the arrangement was left open-ended, so we      can expect to repeat the exchange for future      services!<br />      <br />      Those stories are examples of two of my favorite swaps, but      I've bartered for more than medical expenses over the past      ten years. My other trades include homebaked bread for      mulch, ginseng for printing, corn on the cob for freshly      ground wheat flour, woodenware for pottery, venison for      pork, rawhide for tanned leather, maple syrup for vetch      seed . . . and the list goes on and on!<br />      <br />      We've found that the no-cash economy is thriving in these      parts. Neighbors, trades folk, and even complete strangers      are often willing to swap goods, services, or labor. Often      all it takes to make a deal is the gumption to ask!<br />      <br />      R.L.<br />      Minnesota<br />      <br />      Most of the swappin' tales in MOTHER involve individuals or      families who've made it back to the land. But barter can be      found between organizations as well . . . and can even      exist in the heart of New York City! Here's how our unusual      "corporate" trade came about:<br />      <br />      The city's Metro Chapter of the Registry for Interpreters      for the Deaf and (a separate organization) the Council for      Mental Health Services for the Hearing Impaired, Inc. were      both searching for office space to house their newly formed      chapters. Finally-after realizing that each group alone was      too poor to pay the rent on an adequate suite-they decided      to team up and share business quarters. In practically no      time at all, meeting schedules were juggled to guard      against time conflicts, and a joint furniture hunting      venture was begun.<br />      <br />      But the deal didn't end there! The Council needed sign      language interpreters at its meetings, but the budget      failed to include money for such an expense. With some      downhome barterin' in mind, they went to the Metro RID . .      . and proposed an exchange of services.<br />      <br />      Now the Council has a regular (rotating) "signer" for all      its gatherings . . . and the members of the RID can attend      -free of charge any of the workshops on mental health      services for the deaf.<br />      <br />      And with luck, the trading will continue . . . with both      organizations sharing their free copies of      <strong>MOTHER</strong> .<br />      <br />      T.F.<br />      New York<br />      <br />      For several years my husband and I hoarded a box of      pheasant feathers-relics of past hunting trips-in our      basement. We pondered (as the plumes collected dust) how to      best utilize the delicate and attractive agents of flight.      Then -in MOTHER NO. 60-we discovered the answer to our      dilemma!<br />      <br />      Guided by the article "Fine-Feathered Hatbands", we made      several samples of the headwear . . . and took the feathery      items to a new boutique in town. Luckily for us, western      hats-and other related items of apparel-were becoming      increasingly popular at that time, so the store manager was      eager to give the bands a chance.<br />      <br />      Now-one short month later-we can barely keep up with the      demands for the feathered millinery of our new "bootstrap      business". But the best part of the deal is that-rather      than receive money for the hat-bands-we trade with the      store! One of our favorite exchanges involved swapping our      feathered haberdashery for a fabulous leather hat for my      husband and a gorgeous suede coat for me . . . both of      which we'd never have been able to "buy" otherwise. Thank      you, MOTHER!<br />      <br />      R.L.<br />      California<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The following two submissions are not      only coincidental . . . but also show that the barter      system-when used well-makes both</em> <em>parties feel that      they got the best part of the bargain!</em><br />      <br />      When Karl, Rene, Larisa, and I settled here in the eastern      Pyrenees five years ago, we wondered vaguely if we'd be      able to find swappin' people like those we knew back in      Rochester, New York. Well . . . find 'em we did. Although      "to bargain" is pronounced troquer here, the practice seems      to bring the same satisfaction to people as it does back in      the U.S.A.<br />      <br />      Shortly after we bought our present home, some helpful      neighbors offered us a fine woodstove that had been      relegated to the shed when the folks remodeled their      kitchen.<br />      <br />      "How about taking one of our (future) goat kids in      exchange:"' we asked . . . they replied, "Fine," . . . and      voile, our first French swap was made.<br />      <br />      Later-when we no longer kept billies and nannies-some      goat-herding friends offered to trade their surplus milk      for some of our special whole wheat bread. We agreed to a      once-a-week swap, and that arrangement is now in its third      year! (Often one swap leads to another: Yesterday, for      instance, a woman with a honey business asked to trade the      sweetener for some of our bread . . . which she had tasted      at the goat people's home!)<br />      <br />      We've been given honey in exchange for replacing a damaged      auto taillight, too . . . plus some handwoven slippers for      wheat, a custom made wool vest for guitar lessons, knitting      wool for cheese, and wheat-grinding for homemade peanut      butter. I guess this proves that there are eager swappers      most anywhere . . . even in a mountainous rural area where      neighbors are few and far between. Under these conditions,      barter is a logical and enjoyable part of an all-too-rare      visit.<br />      <br />      J.N.<br />      Olette, France<br />      <br />      The barter system is alive and well in the south of France!      (At least here in the Pyrenees Orientales . . . I can't      speak for the more "fashionable" regions.) My husband and I      are English, and came to live in this beautiful-and      relatively unspoiled-part of France three years ago.      Through necessity at first (then more and more willingly)      we developed a relatively self-sufficient lifestyle. Our      one priceless asset is the old mill-now run by      electricity-which is part of the property. My husband      restored it to working order, and we are now able to      prepare and eat the most nutritious and tasty bread      imaginable!<br />      <br />      As word began to circulate that the mill was back in      operation, couples and small groups of people began to call      on us . . . dragging sacks of grain from their      often-beat-up old cars and asking hesitantly if it would be      possible to have it ground. We were delighted to discover      so many people living on the ragged edge of this      middle-class-oriented society . . . and even happier to      exchange milling for new laid eggs, grain, or fresh      produce.<br />      <br />      The first of our new-found friends were an American couple,      with whom we immediately entered into a system of barter.      We exchange everything from pumpkin pickles and marmalade      to-you've guessed it-our copies of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      (restricted) !<br />      <br />      P.A.<br />      Olette, France    </p>
