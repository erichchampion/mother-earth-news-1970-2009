               <p>      For the past several years, the good folks at the Institute      for Local Self-Reliance in Washington, D.C. have worked to      help urban residents gain greater control over their lives      through the use of low-technology, decentralist tools and      concepts. We strongly believe that more people (city      dwellers and country folk alike) should be exposed to the      Institute's admirable efforts . . . which is why we've made      this "what's happening where" report by ILSR staffers one      of MOTHER's regular features.    </p>        <p>      Suppose that-in some particular city-there's a      carpenter who dreams of learning to play the piano . . .      and, nearby, a music teacher who's looking for someone to      advise her on how much insulation her home should have.      Meanwhile, in the same metropolis, a community group that's      doing energy audits is looking for help in remodeling its      new offices.<br />      <br />      Such interlocking webs of talents and needs aren't all that      uncommon in large urban centers. In most cases, however,      the people involved never learn about their complementary      abilities and wants ... they become examples of the      thousands of "resource leaks" that occur in any city when      people and information aren't properly matched.<br />      <br />      Many community groups have set up organized exchanges to      help people contact others . . . to teach or learn skills,      acquire information, swap goods, or simply get aid in      planning a community project. The most successful of these      organizations-The Learning Exchange (TLE) in      Evanston, Illinois is now eight years old and has over      30,000 members.<br />      <br />      Despite the success of that operation, however, the      mortality rate for exchanges is extremely high. Most groups      follow one of two quick routes to oblivion: They either      think too big, or think too small.<br />      <br />      <strong>AVOIDING A BIG MISTAKE</strong><br />      <br />      Many exchanges die of overgrowth because-as they      acquire more and more members-they fail to adopt the      professional business techniques necessary to cover their      steadily increasing overhead costs. And those groups that      do take a businesslike stance often find themselves      squeezed between raising their fees to cover expenses      (while perhaps losing participants and failing to      accomplish some of their original social goals) and      spending excessive amounts of time searching for outside      subsidies.<br />      <br />      The Evanston group avoided such a dilemma by making two      decisions at the outset of its program. First, it wanted to      offer a variety of easy-to-manage services, and determined      that it would recruit the large membership needed to      support such services. Second, TLE wanted the bulk of its      working capital to come from its members, and so built the      cost of soliciting the needed funds, into its budget.<br />      <br />      The types of services that TLE offers (and doesn't offer)      are all related to its substantial growth. The operation      isn't technically an exchange, but instead functions as a      referral service. Barter is possible within the TLE system,      but only on a one-to-one basis. The Learning Exchange's top      administrators say that credit record systems-which      are essential for multi-party barter- are "too costly      and complicated to administer". The keeping of such records      makes running a large-membership swap system much more      difficult than operating a smaller organization.<br />      <br />      <strong>THERE ARE</strong> <strong>SMALL ROBLEMS,      TOO</strong><br />      <br />      Exchanges can most effectively offer the advantages of a      credit system by deliberately limiting their membership.      They can also, however, make the mistake of remaining too      small. An exchange needs a fair number of participants to      maintain member interest. After all, people won't receive      much in return for joining such a group if they have only a      few other members with whom to trade. Interest can also      wane when an exchange's information isn't up to date, when      participant satisfaction isn't monitored, and when renewal      memberships aren't followed up on. Unfortunately,      "maintenance" bookkeeping is usually at a minimum (or      nonexistent) in small exchanges.<br />      <br />      That doesn't have to be the case, however. A few people      with good management skills can help an exchange avoid the      common "too small" problems.<br />      <br />      David Tobin (of the Washington, D.C. Barter Project) points      out that some small groups can easily cut costs by      providing credits in return for labor and material      contributions toward organizational overhead costs: For      example, participants in a Eugene, Oregon exchange are able      to get credit-instead of being paid-for putting      in volunteer time in the group's office, while a print shop      earned barter points by producing promotional flyers for      the organization.<br />      <br />      Through the Barter Project, Tobin can provide a limited      amount of technical assistance and information to newly      formed exchanges. He eventually hopes to be able to raise      funds to provide seed grants to start new exchanges or      "beef up" struggling organizations. For further      information, write (sending a dollar to help cover the      group's costs) to the Barter Project, Dept. TMEN, 1214 16th      Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.    </p>
