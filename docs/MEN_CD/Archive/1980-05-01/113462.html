        <p>In 1976, I was working-as a custom furniture maker-in <span id="lw_1175472541_0">San Jose , California</span>. . .when I ran across an eight-inch plano convex lens in the wreckage of an old theater. The piece of salvage lay around collecting dust for several months before I realized its potential as a solar wood-burning tool.</p><p>Even then, I initially thought of the lens simply as a means of adding detail to some of the lamps, beds, doors, etc. that I constructed . . . but I soon discovered that I could make a better living by selling the sun <em>etchings</em> alone!<br /><br />ELABORATE PREPARATIONS<br /><br />During the course of the following year, I figured out how to make circular frames and developed a method of "double-lensing", where one lens acts as an amplifier for the focal point of a smaller lens, in order to produce tiny lines. And, of course,my woodworking skills were an asset . . . because the more solar etching I did, the more elaborate my formats became.<br /><br />Sometimes it takes five days of preparation before my wooden "canvases" ever reach the sunlight. I cut, laminate, and hand-plane the lumber, in addition to making the frame. Then-after the etching is done-I brush off the ash, sand the wood, clean it with an eraser, and put three coats of lacquer or Varathane on the surface.<br /><br />The composition which I call "Vision Through a Keyhole" (shown in one of the accompanying photos) incorporates, for instance, over 75 separate wood pieces, including a bentwood frame. And, in the summer of 1978, I started what may well be the world's largest solar wood-burning project. With the help of an assistant, Daniel Ondrasek, I collected scrap 2 X 4's from building sites and constructed an 18' X 7', 1,500-pound slab that had to be rolled out into the sunshine on a special platform. The etching, which took over a ,year to complete, depicts a 1920's view of the <span id="lw_1175472541_1">Santa Clara</span> Valley-then called "The Valley of Heart's Delight"-from Mt. Hamilton . (Today, the area is full of tract 'homes, the sites for some of which provided the scraps for our giant artwork.)<br /><br />COOPERATIVE NATURE<br /><br />My chief subjects are boats, plants, 'trees, and landscapes . . . and are usually burned into the redwood and pine commonly found in <span id="lw_1175472541_2">California</span>. Most of the time, I'll work along with the material's natural grain, but I also laminate wood on occasion. I prefer to use Brooks pine, which has a lot of blue (as well as other natural colors) running through it, while I mostly use redwood for frames and as a color accent in some of the laminates. (I have no problem burning an image into dense oak, maple, or walnut . . . but such hardwoods are quite expensive in the West.)<br /><br />I've found my salvaged lens to be so powerful that it can strike a flame the instant I bring it into focus, and the light is so bright that I've permanently installed a set of No. 5 welder's lenses into the back of my sunglasses, for safety's sake.<br /><br />Most people are quite astonished when they first see the lens turn sunshine into fire, but they also seem to be a bit disappointed that I sketch in my image first with a pencil . . . somehow, my "audience" considers that to be a form of cheating. However, I prefer to predraw my designs, so that I can erase anything I don't like before I burn the wood. (Erasing-or simply lightening the image-can also be accomplished by sanding the surface.)<br /><br />A WAY OF LIFE<br /><br />In 1977, I had to teach to supplement my "art" income, but a year later my solar etchings had made me totally independent . . . and my sales have doubled every year since I started.<br /><br />I used to sell the pieces (priced anywhere from $10 to $500-sometimes even more-depending on the materials and time involved) at art and craft fairs. Now, however, I'm concentrating on marketing my work exclusively in art galleries. That way, I can spend more time at home experimenting with the many forms that sun, trees, and imagination can create.</p>
