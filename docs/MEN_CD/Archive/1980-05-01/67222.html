                <h1 id=" title">      ECOSCIENCE: The Greeks and Romans Did It, Too!    </h1>    <h5 id="byline">      By ANNE AND PAUL EHRLICH    </h5>        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population", "resources", and "environment" in      the late 1960's. (They also coined the term coevolu</em>      <em>tion, and did a lot to make ecology the household word      it is today.) But while most folks are aware of the      Ehrlichs' popular writing in the areas of ecology and      overpopulation (most of us-for instance-have      read Paul's book The Population Bomb) . . . far too few      people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (research of the type that      tends to be published only in technical journals and      college textbooks). That's why it pleases us to be able to      present-on a regular basis-the following      semi-technical column by authors/ecologists/educators Anne      and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>         <p>      It's a common misconception that ecological problems first      began to plague our planet shortly after the Second World      War . . . or, at least, that such tragedies don't go back      any further than the Industrial Revolution. But, in fact,      our earth is strewn with evidence of past ecocatastrophes,      and nowhere is our history of environmental disasters      exhibited more dramatically than in the Mediterranean Basin      and the Near East.<br />      <br />      This once rich, bountiful, largely forested land includes      the "Fertile Crescent" . . . an area beginning on the      eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, curving north of      the Syrian desert and then south through the Tigris and      Euphrates Valleys of what is now Iraq. It was in this      crescent-10,000 years ago-that agriculture was      first practiced.<br />      <br />      We recently had an opportunity to visit the Mediterranean      region . . . and to see for ourselves the present state of      this former "Eden" which was the cradle of Western      civilization. Our overall impression was that the once rich      area is now a badly deteriorated land inhabited by      relatively impoverished peoples . . . who, today, are      partly dependent for their survival on the influx of      tourists coming to see the physical monuments of past      civilizations.<br />      <br />      The region's decline from ancient glory has been a complex      process, but a major element in the "fall" has been the      failure-on the part of the area's residents-to      maintain the ecological systems that supported their rich      cultures.<br />      <br />      The process began with the marvelous Mesopotamian      civilization, which produced the world's first cities in      the area watered by the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The      society depended utterly on a complex irrigation system      that-along with the invention of the      plow-allowed its farmers to extract more food from      the rich soil than was required for their own families. The      resultant surplus made the development of urban centers      possible.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, however, irrigation is a temporary game.      Sooner or later, silt accumulates in canals, and salts      accrue in the soil . . . processes that are difficult to      counter even with modern technology. Lacking the means to      solve such problems-and harassed by invaders as      well-the civilization of the Tigris and Euphrates      valleys collapsed in the first great ecocatastrophe.<br />      <br />      The ancient Egyptians were more fortunate than the      Mesopotamians. They, too, were dependent on river water for      survival, but the annual Nile flood was an enormous      blessing to them. The overflowing waters deposited yearly      loads of silt on the agricultural lands of the Nile Delta,      simultaneously fertilizing the soil and preventing      salinization. Egypt, therefore, maintained a high      civilization for several thousand years, and served as a      granary for Rome as late as the third century A.D.<br />      <br />      The Greeks inherited a land covered by rich stands of oaks,      pines, and other trees with thick, drought-resistant leaves      . . . called a "sclerophyllous forest", in the jargon of      plant ecologists. But, as the Greek population expanded, it      progressively destroyed the forests for firewood, charcoal      (needed in firing pottery and other industrial processes),      and lumber. The great trees were often burned by accident,      too . . . or as part of a military operation, or simply to      create more open pastureland.<br />      <br />      Soil erosion on the slopes of the rugged Greek hills helped      prevent reforestation . . . as did grazing and browsing      animals, which killed the seedlings before they could      establish themselves. Especially prominent in the latter      role were goats . . . the "horned locusts" that have      destroyed so much of the vegetation of the Mediterranean      region and other areas where they've been introduced. (In      fact it's not unfair, today, to describe much of that      territory as a "goatscape".<br />      <br />      ) The ancient Greeks took an essentially scientific view of      their environment, and some Grecian writers saw that their      land was deteriorating under human stewardship. Four      centuries before Christ, Plato described Attica (the region      around Athens), saying: "What now remains compared with      what then existed is like the skeleton of a sick man, all      the fat and soft earth having wasted away, and only the      bare framework of the land being left." The description is      even more apt today.<br />      <br />      The Romans, in contrast, took a strictly utilitarian view      of their environment: The land was there to be exploited by      <em>Homo Sapiens</em> . The trend toward deforestation      started in Greece and spread-during the Roman      Empire-from the hills of Galilee in Palestine and the      Taurus Mountains of Turkey in the east, to the mountains of      Spain in the west. Various features of the Roman      agricultural economy greatly encouraged this process . . .      and their society had no counterbalancing conservation      ethic.<br />      <br />      Both the Egyptians and Greeks were determined hunters. They      forced many larger animals (such as the lions in upper      Egypt and in Greece) to extinction. But the Roman Empire      had a far greater destructive impact on the fauna of the      ancient world than did its predecessors. Not only were      animals hunted for skins, feathers, and ivory . . . but      multitudes were captured for use in "games".<br />      <br />      Huge numbers of beasts were pitted against each other (and      against human beings) in lethal combats. Titus, for      example, had some 9,000 wild animals slaughtered during the      three months' dedication of the Colosseum, and Trajan's      conquest of Dacia (modern Romania) was celebrated by games      in which 11,000 beasts were killed. When one considers that      tens or even hundreds of lions, leopards, rhinos, buffalos,      and so on must have died-or been killed-in      transport or captivity for every one that lived to      entertain the citizens, the probable scale of the Roman      impact on wildlife staggers the imagination.<br />      <br />      The Romans hit hard at their environment . . . but it      struck back! Deforestation, the depletion of soils, and the      exhaustion of mines were all factors in the fall of Rome's      Empire. The Romans didn't finish the job, however. The last      great plundering of Mediterranean forest resources occurred      in the late Middle Ages, when the demand for timber for      fuel and shipbuilding was very great. As a result, there's      very little first-growth sclerophyllous forest left in the      Mediterranean basin today . . . the best examples being in      the Camargue of southern France and on the peninsula of Mt.      Athos in Greece (protected by the famous monastery      there).<br />      <br />      Attempts are being made at reforestation in various areas,      but-because the soil is so depleted-it's a      difficult business. Aleppo pine trees are being planted in      many parts of Greece, but Greek environmentalists told us      that arboreal survival on the slopes is often as low as ten      percent, unless tons of soil are imported with each tree .      . . an inordinately expensive process.<br />      <br />      In general, the areas of the Mediterranean basin that      aren't being intensively cultivated or grazed today are      covered with a community of drought-resistant shrubs called      <em>maquis</em> . (Maquis is French for bush, and was a      term used for the French resistance forces in World War II,      which hid out in the bush.) Similar plant communities in      the Mediterranean climate of California are known as      <em>chaparral</em> and in Chile as <em>matorral</em>      .<br />      <br />      When a piece of land is denuded, vegetation usually returns      in a sequence determined by the climate, soil, and      evolutionary history of the area. The process is called      "succession", and its final stage is the "climax". The      normal successional sequence in Mediterranean climates is      from bare soil to grassland to maquis to sclerophyllous      forest climax. But, in most places, the succession is      prevented from going to completion by such periodic      disturbances as fire, erosion, harvesting for firewood,      goat browsing, and so forth.<br />      <br />      Of course, the destruction of the forests of the      Mediterranean has meant more than the loss of an important      renewable resource and of the animals associated with the      forest. It has also triggered a shift toward a drier      climate, accompanied by the disappearance of many springs      and a general reduction in the availability of fresh water.      Much of what was once a "land of milk and honey" has been      converted into semiarid wasteland and desert.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, many forces seem to conspire to keep the      ecological situation in most of the Mediterranean region in      a state of constant deterioration. For example, the Aswan      High Dam in Egypt has put an end to the Nile's      soilenriching floods. As a result, farmers must purchase      expensive fertilizers they can ill afford, and serious      problems of salt buildup have been encountered. And the      increase in food production permitted by the irrigation      system drawing water from the reservoir is not enough to      feed the people added to Egypt's population during its ten      years of construction.<br />      <br />      On top of that, the erection of the dam has also increased      the threat of <em>bilharzia</em> , a serious disease caused      by parasites that have snails as intermediate hosts. The      snails, it seems, find the new irrigation conditions      especially congenial, but so far public health measures      have prevented a major increase in the percentage of people      infected.<br />      <br />      But, incredibly, some Egyptians still look to Aswan as a      "solution" to their population problems . . . though Egypt      is apparently doomed to double its population in the next      three decades or so. And, since virtually every available      inch of nondesert land is already intensively utilized, no      conceivable new schemes based on Aswan could expand      cultivated land fast enough and far enough . . . even if      the capital and organization to attempt such expansion      could be mobilized. We found the plight of Egypt's present      population as desperate as the monuments of past      civilizations are impressive.<br />      <br />      In Athens, the Greeks have adopted the automobile-and      other aspects of modern industry-in a big way, adding      heavy air pollution to the nation's other problems . . .      and that pollution attacks more than Greek lungs. It's also      rapidly eroding the stone treasures of the Acropolis, which      attract the millions of tourists that play a key role in      the nation's economy.<br />      <br />      Similar problems are reported in Italy, and our      introduction to Spain's famous Costa del Sol was a view of      many miles of shoreline crammed with hotels and apartment      buildings . . . with denuded hills as backdrop. The rapidly      growing resorts spew their untreated sewage into the sea      and provide a most unhealthful environment for anyone      foolhardy enough to take a swim.<br />      <br />      All of the nations of the Mediterranean area have growing      populations. Those of Spain, Greece, and Yugoslavia are      increasing at a comparatively rapid rate for European      countries. (Each will double in well under a century,      unless the demographic situation changes.) Worse yet, the      Arab nations of North Africa and the Middle East are mostly      growing at rates that will double their sizes in 20 to 30      years. These countries' consciousness of demographic and      ecological problems is, in most cases, depressingly low . .      . as is their awareness of the connection between      overpopulation and ecological catastrophe.<br />      <br />      Israel, however, has a sophisticated scientific community      and has proven itself to be a leader in restoring an      overtaxed environment to agricultural productivity. The      tiny nation might have the potential to lead the entire      basin toward ecological recovery, but the present political      situation makes it seem unlikely that Israel will be able      to play such a role in the foreseeable future.<br />      <br />      There is, however, some embryonic cooperation among 17 of      the Mediterranean states in a project called the <em>Blue      Plan</em> . . . the goal of which is to "save" the      Mediterranean Sea. It represents a halting first step in      the right direction.<br />      <br />      One can see in the Mediterranean basin what may be a      foretaste of the fate of Earth itself. A previously rich      and selfsustaining region has run steadily downhill, until      it can barely scrape by in increasing poverty and      ecological difficulties . . . even with outside aid such as      imports of food and energy. It's important that the world      as a whole learn from such past ecocatastrophes. If the      entire planet is allowed to deteriorate as far as has the      center of ancient civilization, humanity will have no place      to turn for aid.<br />      <br />      <em>Much of the information on the distant past is from J.      Donald Hughes's excellent book,</em> <em>Ecology for      Ancient Civilizations (University of New Mexico Press,      Albuquerque, 1975).
