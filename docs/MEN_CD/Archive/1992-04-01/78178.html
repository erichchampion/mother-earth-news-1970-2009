                <h5 id="byline">      By Gail Damerow    </h5>            <p>      Owners of high-tension fences love to trade stories about      line wires that spring back into place after being pinned      to the ground by a fallen tree, flattened by a runaway      bale, or challenged by a bull elk. Staples may pop loose      from posts, and posts may bend or break, but wires remain      taut and the fence stays fully functional.    </p>    <p>      Known as "New Zealand," "high tension," "HT," or "tension"      fence, this fence of posts and smooth wire costs -      strand for strand - about the same as a barbed-wire      fence, yet it is far more humane. It is also as effective      as woven wire, but much less costly. And best of all, a      properly constructed tension fence will outlast both barbed      wire and woven wire, with far less maintenance.    </p>    <p>      As complicated as the name may sound, constructing a high      tension fence isn't hard: Start with some anchor      assemblies, string the bottom wire as a guide for line post      alignment, set line posts, string remaining line wires,      tension the wires, fasten the wires to line posts, then add      spacers.    </p>    <h3>      High-Tensile Wire    </h3>    <p>      The key to an effective tension fence is high-tensile wire      that is able to withstand constant fence tension, as well      as tension increases due to animal impact or cold-weather      contraction. While all high-tension fences are constructed      of high-tensile wire, not all fences made of high-tensile      wire are high-tension fences.    </p>    <p>      "High-tensile" refers to the wire's strength. "High      tension" refers to its tautness - great enough so      that the wires can't be easily pried apart and will bounce      back on sudden impact. Instead of bouncing back,      low-tensile wire (called "soft" wire because it contains      less carbon and is therefore physically softer), stretches      and breaks in similar situations.    </p>    <p>      The most commonly used high-tensile wire is 12 1/2 gauge,      which is stronger and easier to see than wire of higher      gauge, yet not as stiff and difficult to work with as wire      of lower gauge. A coating of zinc, aluminum, or      aluminum-zinc alloy protects the wire from rust      (zinc-coated wire - galvanized - is the best      compromise between cost and durability).    </p>    <h3>      Anchor Assemblies    </h3>    <p>      The high-tensile wire is strung between key posts that form      the fence's foundation. Collectively called "anchor" posts,      they are located at each corner and end (which may or may      not be at a gate). Anchor posts must be braced in order to      withstand the intense pressure exerted by tensioned wire,      multiplied by the number of wires in the fence.    </p>    <p>      A horizontal brace, or H-brace, is the strongest of all      braces and therefore the best sort for a tension fence. The      assembly's great strength comes from a brace rail, riding      between the anchor post and the brace post. Fence wire      pulls against the anchor post from one direction while the      rail pushes against it from the other.    </p>    <p>      The anchor post is 6" in diameter, the brace post is 5".      Both posts should be pressure-treated and at least 8' long;      set them no less than 3' deep. Anything less would be      lifted right out of the ground by tensioned line wires. In      northern climates, all posts must go below the frost line      to avoid frost heave.    </p>    <p>      For the rail, you'll need a milled 4 x 4 or an 8' long,      5"-diameter wood pole. You'll also need a pair of steel or      fiberglass dowels or "brace pins," 3/8 to 1/2" in diameter      - one 5" long and one 10" long. (To save money, you      can cut your own brace pins from 3/8" rebar.)    </p>    <p>      Drill a hole in the anchor post - in the direction of      the fence line - 4" from the top, 2" deep, and the      same diameter as your brace pins. Then drill a hole of the      same diameter and height all the way through the post.    </p>    <p>      Bore holes of the same diameter 2" deep into the ends of      the brace. Drive the short pin into the anchor post, and      fit the brace into the protruding end. Lift the brace into      place and drive the long pin into it through the brace      post, leaving 2" of the pin sticking out the other side of      the post.    </p>    <p>      To keep the assembly rigid, add a diagonal stay wire. Wrap      a single strand of 12 1/2 gauge high-tensile wire around      the lower end of the anchor post, secure it with a Gripple      UItradenam (described below), and staple it into place. Run      the other end diagonally to the top of the brace post      (above the protruding pin), wrap it around the post, secure      it with a second Gripple, and pull the wire taut.    </p>    <p>      In moderately well-drained soil, a single H-brace assembly      will support up to 10 strands of wire as an end post, and      up to five strands as a corner post. Each corner, of      course, requires two assemblies which are perpendicular to      each other.    </p>    <p>      For a fence with more strands of wire or an especially long      run (a run being the distance between anchor posts), two or      three assemblies in a row offer greater holding power. To      keep a double or triple assembly from buckling, line up the      anchor post and brace posts in a straight line.    </p>    <h3>      Pull Posts    </h3>    <p>      To maintain proper tension in a long, straight run,      periodically brace a line post, which then is called a      "pull" post. Bracing consists of two H-assemblies, each      with a second diagonal stay wire forming an "X" with the      first, to compensate for the pull of wire from opposite      directions. The pull post should be at least 5" in diameter      and the two brace posts should be 4".    </p>    <p>      If your fence goes over hill and dale, place a post at the      bottom of every significant depression or dip to eliminate      gaps. Also place a post at the top of every significant      knoll or rise to maintain adequate fence height. Dip posts      must be well anchored to prevent pullout, rise posts to      prevent leaning.    </p>    <h3>      Line Posts    </h3>    <p>      Anchor posts form the fence's foundation and take up      line-wire tension. Spacing the line posts evenly between      them helps maintain line-wire spacing despite      back-scratching, pushing, and other typical livestock      activities. While line wires are firmly attached to an      anchor post, they're loosely affixed to line posts so they      can readily move as a result of animal pressure, or      expansion and contraction due to changing temperatures.    </p>    <p>      Since line posts incur less stress than anchor posts, they      needn't be as stout or set as deep. Set pressure-treated      wood posts at least 2 1/2' deep, steel T posts or      fiberglass posts 1 1/2' to 2' deep.    </p>    <p>      Lightweight spacers of wood or fiberglass, placed between      line posts, let you increase the distance between posts,      reducing the fence's cost. Because spacers are firmly      attached to the line wires and bounce whenever the wires      move, they are sometimes called "dancers."    </p>    <p>      Always measure the distance between line posts from the      center of one to the center of the next. The closer posts      are spaced, the greater the load imposed on them during      impact, and the greater the chance they will overturn,      bend, or break. In a tension fence, the wires - not      the posts - create the physical barrier that control      animals.    </p>    <p>      On open, level range, set posts 100 feet apart with spacers      every 33 feet between them. For a typical pasture on level      terrain, space posts 30 feet apart with spacers every 10      feet. If the pasture is heavily grazed, place spacers every      5 feet; if lightly grazed, every 15 feet.    </p>    <p>      Align posts on the side of the fence to which the wire will      be attached - the inside if your primary goal is to      keep livestock in a corral or pasture; the outside if your      goal is to keep wildlife out of your orchard or garden.      Careful alignment is especially important when you use wood      posts, since they vary in diameter.    </p>    <p>      Stretch the bottom wire between adjoining anchor posts and      use it as your guide for aligning line posts. Set the posts      a fraction of an inch from the wire so your fence doesn't      wander off into left field.    </p>    <h3>      Line Wires    </h3>    <p>      When all of your line posts are in, string the remaining      line wires between adjoining anchor posts. Attach the wires      to the line posts after the wires have been fully      tensioned. Make an exception for rise and dip posts, since      wire can't be easily pulled up or down (as the case may be)      after being tensioned.    </p>    <p>      Fasten wires to line posts with 1 3/4" galvanized fence      staples, set only so deep that the wire can slide freely      between staple and post. Attaching line wires with      electric-fence insulators instead of staples increases your      cost, but also increases the life of your fence by reducing      friction that wears away the wire's coating.    </p>    <p>      How many strands you string and how far apart you space      them depends on several things: what kinds of animals you      plan to confine, their size, how active they are, and how      crowded they are. To control a bunch of beasts, design your      fence for the smallest and/or most active.    </p>    <p>      Since the bottom one-third of any fence experiences the      most animal pressure, line wires are spaced closer together      at the bottom and progressively farther apart toward the      top. A typical tension fence has eight or 10 wires, spaced      as shown in the accompanying chart.    </p>        <h3>      Splicers    </h3>    <p>      You have several options for connecting the end of one roll      of wire to the beginning of another, or for splicing a      broken wire: Compression sleeves are little metal tubes      that you compress after threading wires through opposite      ends. Connector twists are stiff wire spirals that you wind      around butted wire ends. Wirelinks are spring-loaded metal      cartridges that work like Chinese handcuffs from a      carnival.    </p>    <p>      Gripples are rectangular devices with internal serrated      rollers that grasp wires. They are the easiest splicers to      use if you don't have someone to hold the wire ends while      you fasten them together.    </p>    <p>      Similar choices are available for tying off wire at anchor      posts. You can thread a compression sleeve onto the wire,      wrap the wire once around the post, tuck the end into the      sleeve, and crimp the sleeve shut. Alternatively, you can      bring the wire around the post and fasten it with a      connector twist. A Gripple or a Wirelink (the end-splice      version of a Wirevise) has the advantage of letting you      take up excess slack after tying off the wire.    </p>    <p>      Unless you use Wirelinks, which are affixed through bored      holes, staple line wires to anchor posts so they can't slip      up or down. Set staples snugly, but not so tightly that you      bury the staple into the post and damage the wire.    </p>        <h3>      In-Line Tensioners    </h3>    <p>      When all your line wires are strung and fastened, tighten      them with in-line tensioners. Like splicers, in-line      tensioners come in various styles. Be sure to select a      style designed specifically for tension fences.    </p>    <p>      Despite their varied appearances, in-line tensioners all      work essentially the same way. Attach one to the line wire      and turn it to wind up slack. You need one or more for each      wire in your fence. Exactly where along the wire you place      the tensioner depends on the length of the run, and on      whether your terrain is level or sloped.    </p>    <p>      If your fence goes up a hill, install tensioners near the      downslope anchor post. If the run is less than 600 feet,      put tensioners near an anchor post that allows easy access.      If the run is over 600 feet, install tensioners at midpoint      for even tensioning.    </p>    <p>      How much wire you can tighten with one tensioner varies      with the brand. A typical tensioner can handle a straight      run of up to 3,000 feet. If the distance between anchor      posts is greater, place two tensioners on each wire at      evenly spaced intervals. Dip posts increase friction,      decreasing the length of wire one tensioner can handle by      500 feet.    </p>    <p>      Install tensioners no closer to the nearest post than four      feet so that you have plenty of cranking room. Since a      tensioner creeps forward as it takes up slack, orient it to      move <em>away</em> from the post.    </p>    <p>      After all tensioners are installed, tighten line wires one      by one, starting at the top. Come back the next day and      retighten all tensioners a click or two.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        TRAINING LIVESTOCK AND<br />        WILDLIFE TO RESPECT YOUR<br />        ELECTRIC FENCE      </h3>      <p>        Animals - both domestic and wild - will go        under, over, or through an electric fence unless they are        taught to respect it. Training entails making sure the        animal gets its initial shock on a sensitive body        part-tongue, nose, or ear - which is likely if the        animal approaches the fence out of cautious curiosity.      </p>      <p>        A jolt about the face causes an animal to back off. If        the animal first encounters the fence at a dead run, it        may feel little or nothing through thick fur. Even if it        gets zapped part-way through, its natural tendency is to        move forward. An animal that gets through once may never        develop respect for an electric fence.      </p>      <p>        Training wildlife requires clearing the fence line so        creatures can see the wires from a distance. You might        also bait hot wires with favorite foods or shiny objects        to encourage curious individuals to investigate. Despite        your best efforts, wildlife may still get through if        chased by dogs.      </p>      <p>        Domestic animals that grow up with electric fences learn        to respect them from the start. Older animals, especially        inherently spooky or skittish ones, require a period of        training in a small electrified enclosure.      </p>      <p>        The best training occurs during times of minimum stress.        Leave animals alone to explore at their leisure, rather        than driving them into the fence. Average training time        ranges from 12 to 48 hours.      </p>      <p>        For the benefit of horses and humans, make your electric        fence readily visible by flagging it with colorful strips        of plastic ribbon, by making the top wire a band of        electroplastic ribbon or "hot tape," or by adding plastic        lighter wires.      </p>      <p>        Livestock and predators alike constantly test an electric        fence, reaffirming their fear with each new jolt.        Predators are especially quick to take advantage of a        breach, making it essential to maintain the pulse at        deterrent level. Well-trained livestock tend to be a bit        slower on the uptake, often taking days or even weeks        before discovering freedom.      </p>    </div>    <h3>      Tension    </h3>    <p>      Your fence will function properly only when the line wires      are kept under proper tension. If tension is too low,      livestock can push the wires apart and get through. If      tension is too high, anchor posts will pull out and brace      assemblies will buckle. Over-tensioned wire can also break      and recoil, causing serious injury. Wear gloves and safety      goggles when you work with high-tensile wire.    </p>    <p>      Even if the wire doesn't break, over-tensioning can stretch      it beyond its elastic limit. This will cause it to remain      permanently stretched. You should tension high-tensile wire      only to one-third its minimum breaking strength so that      additional stretching due to impact or high temperature      won't push it beyond its limit. General practice is to      tension 12 1/2 gauge wire to between 250 and 300 pounds.    </p>    <p>      Measure tension directly with a torque wrench if your      in-line tensioners are the kind that you can tighten with a      socket wrench. A torque of 12 foot-pounds is approximately      equal to 250 pounds.    </p>    <p>      A compression spring, installed next to an in-line      tensioner, offers another way to measure tension. When the      spring is shortened by 1 1/2 to 2 inches (depending on its      brand), the wire is tensioned to 250 pounds. Some brands      have tension indicator marks, each notch representing      approximately 100 pounds.    </p>    <p>      Save money by placing a spring on one wire only, tensioning      the rest by feel and sight. Pull each wire toward you the      same distance and then judge whether it offers the same      amount of resistance as the wire with the spring.    </p>    <p>      Once your fence is properly tensioned, it requires only      infrequent adjustment if you live in a temperate area. If,      however, your annual temperature range exceeds 100°F      (56°C), reduce the tension each fall and increase it      again each spring. For every 10°F (5°C) above or      below 60° F ( 15°C), subtract or add 10 pounds (50      N) of tension.    </p>    <h3>      Electric Tension Fence    </h3>    <p>      A tension fence can be designed as a physical barrier that      animals can't get through, or as a psychological barrier      that intimidates animals into not <em>wanting</em> to get      through. Sufficient intimidation, for most animals, is the      threat of an electric shock.    </p>    <p>      Like all fences, an electrified tension fence has built-in      disadvantages as well as advantages. Unless it also      functions as a physical barrier, it must be electrified at      all times to remain effective. In addition, you may have to      alter your management practices - no longer can you      crowd animals against a fence corner for routine handling.      In some areas, the law prohibits electric fences adjacent      to roadways or public lands. In other areas, you must post      warning signs at specified intervals.    </p>    <p>      So why, you might ask, would anyone electrify a tension      fence? For one thing, the electric version is cheaper      because it requires fewer wires. Also, since the wires      aren't strung at the same high tension and aren't subject      to the same amount of animal pressure, anchor assemblies      needn't be as strong.    </p>    <p>      An electric fence lasts longer, since animals won't rub      against it, climb on it, or push through it. Most      importantly, an electric tension fence gives you better      control of livestock and greater protection from predators.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        SELECTING AN ENERGIZER      </h3>      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/131-32-i3.jpg" alt="131-32-i3.jpg" width="227" height="211" />      </div>      <p class="caption">        <em>A solar-powered fence with fiberglass<br />        posts helps keep<br />        in livestock and keep out the predators</em>      </p>      <p>        Energizer, controller, fence charger, power unit -        all these terms refer to that little box responsible for        the big jolt you get when you touch an electric fence.        The right size energizer for you depends on the length of        your fence, how many pulsed wires it contains, what kind        of wire you use, what kinds of animals you want to        control, and how much weed encroachment is likely.      </p>      <p>        Look for a "high-energy, low-impedance" controller,        so-called because it generates a lot of energy without        restricting energy flow. These units are more powerful        than conventional controllers, yet remain extremely safe.        Despite their high voltage, pulses last as little as        0.0001 seconds and are spaced about one second apart.        Touch the fence and you'll get quite a shock, but the        ensuing off-time lets you pull back and recover.      </p>      <p>        Where electricity isn't available or power outages are        frequent, a battery-operated energizer may be the answer.        To prevent rapid draining of the battery, however, these        units pack less wallop than a plug-in (or mains) unit,        and they can't handle much weed load.      </p>      <p>        For either a plug-in or a battery-operated energizer,        except to pay between $100 and $350, depending on quality        and output.      </p>    </div>    <h3>      Deterrent Value    </h3>    <p>      Exactly how much deterrent value an electric fence has      depends on the effectiveness of its energizer (see      "Selecting an Energizer") and the conductivity of its      wires. Happily, the same 12 1/2 gauge, high-tensile wire      used for a standard tension fence is also perfect for      constructing an electric fence. This highly conductive      wire, coupled with a high-energy, low-impedance energizer,      makes an electric tension fence far more reliable than the      conventional electric fences that fell out of favor years      ago.    </p>    <p>      Constructing an electrified tension fence is not much      different from constructing a non-electrified one. The      chief difference is that an electric fence has fewer wires      under considerably less tension. Compared to between 250      and 300 pounds of tension for a barrier fence, an electric      fence needs only 150 to 200 pounds.    </p>    <p>      On level terrain, line posts needn't be as closely spaced      - as for a barrier fence - because an electric      fence doesn't incur as much animal pressure. Posts can be      as far apart as 100 feet, with spacers at midpoint. For a      fence with up to six line wires, single-span anchor      assemblies work tine. For seven or more wires, you'll need      double assemblies. For long, straight runs, include a      pull-post assembly at least every half-mile.    </p>    <p>      Insulators provide a way to fasten wires to posts while      keeping the two far enough apart to prevent jumping sparks      that cause energy leakage from the pulsed wires. (Note: Use      only those insulators designed for a tension fence.)    </p>    <p>      Fiberglass posts are self-insulating, saving the cost of      insulators and eliminating the chance of reduced shock      value due to dirty or defective insulators.    </p>    <h3>      Hot Wires    </h3>    <p>      For the animal to be controlled, the most important wire in      an electric fence is the one at normal nose height, or      snout two-thirds the animal's total height. If you keep      animals of varying ages, sizes, or temperaments, or if more      than one kind of muncher is pillaging your plants,      construct your fence for the most difficult to control      among them. (The chart offers a starting place for      designing your fence.)    </p>    <p>      In order for any electric fence to work, current must flow      from the energizer through a line wire and back to the      energizer. When this circuit is completed by an animal      standing on the ground, the system is called a      ground-return system.    </p>    <p>      If the ground is dry or covered with snow, or if the animal      hits the fence at a run, a ground-return system doesn't      work well. A wire-return system, involving the grounding of      some line wires, is more reliable, because it is not      dependent on soil conditions. An animal need only touch one      hot wire and one grounded wire to complete the circuit and      suffer the shocking consequences.    </p>    <h3>      Grounding    </h3>    <p>      Grounding quite literally means providing electrical pulses      a ready path through the soil. A good ground is essential      to the proper functioning of an electric fence and -      whether the fence is electrified or not - prevents      lightning damage to buildings, livestock, and humans.    </p>    <p>      Grounding is accomplished by means of one or more 5/8"      diameter steel rods, available at electrical- and      building-supply outlets. For a non-electrified fence,      you'll need rods long enough to extend six" above your line      posts and as deep into the soil as necessary to reach      moisture.    </p>    <p>      Drive each rod close to a post, on the same side as the      line wire. Secure the rod to the post, with the wire      sandwiched between them so the rod makes firm contact.    </p>    <p>      Use at least one grounding rod between each pair of anchor      assemblies. In dry soil, place the rods no less than 150      feet from each anchor post and no more than twice that      distance from the next nearest grounding rod. Where the      soil remains moist year round, you can double those      distances.    </p>    <p>      For an electric fence, allow at least three feet of rod per      joule of energizer output. Since one long rod is      impractical, use two or more of sufficient length to make      up the necessary total. You may find that you'll need as      many as seven rods just for the energizer alone.    </p>    <p>      Place the first rod as near as possible to the energizer,      outside any building to minimize the chance of lightning      causing a fire or electrocution. Drive the rod deep enough      to reach moist soil, leaving six inches above ground. Space      additional rods at least 10 feet apart and connect them      with copper ground wire secured with ground clamps.    </p>    <p>      To further reduce the potential for lightning damage, you      can install a lightning diverter and ground rod at least      every mile along your electric fence. In areas where severe      lightning is frequent, place diverters every half-mile. If      your fence measures one-half mile or less, put a diverter      at each corner.    </p>    <p>      In some areas, building codes dictate ground rod length and      diameter. Local codes also dictate how far the fence's      grounding rods must be from those of nearby utilities.    </p>    <p>      "Build all your fences horse high, pig tight, and bull      strong," the old saying goes. If you follow these      instructions and suggestions, not only can your well-built      tension fence be horse high, pig tight, and bull strong,      but it will look good, require little maintenance, and last      a lifetime.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note: Material in this article is adapted from      and appears in Gail</em> <em>Damerow's latest book,      <strong>Fences for Pasture and Garden,</strong> which is      packed with in-depth information on planning and</em>      <em>constructing fences of all kinds.
