        <h3>Protect Our Ancient Forests</h3><p>IF THE WEATHER IS GETTING COLDER, Congress must be back in session. One bill of interest to us Wilderness lovers is H.R. 842, the Ancient Forest Protection Act, which aims to safeguard the ancient forests of Washington, Oregon, and California from further logging and development. "The purpose [of the act] is to see that these forests are allowed to sustain themselves as unique and valuable ecosystems with benefits not just for our generation but for future generations as well," said Rep. Jim Jontz, (D-IN), the author of the bill.</p><p>Of the original 15 million acres of oldgrowth forest that once covered the Pacific Northwest, only one-fifth remains (and only a portion of the remaining growth is protected in Olympic, Mount Rainier, North Cascades, and Redwood national parks, where logging is prohibited). The rest lies on land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. A significant portion of this land has already been segmented by clearcuts, and the timber industry is determined to harvest as many of the remaining stands as possible.</p><p>If we are going to preserve this wondrous natural laboratory and irreplaceable ecosystem, it is up to concerned voters to do so by expressing their support of the Ancient Forest Protection Act. Citizen Action Kits, which include more information about ancient growths, several postcards addressed to key government individuals involved in the bill, and other details of forest protection are available from the Wilderness Society, P.O. Box 296, Federalsburg, MD 21632-0296; please add $2 per kit for shipping and handling. All Timberland store locations also stock the kits.</p><h3>A New Idea in Dog Collars</h3><p><em>Maggie models her new Christmas collar from EBU Designs.</em><br /><br /><br />We were looking for a good Christmas present for our office hound, Maggie (a 12-year-old golden retriever), and came across some nifty new collars completely different from the usual leather or chain variety. The band of the collar is made of a fleece material that rubs softly against the dog's neck and doesn't mat down its fur. And someone finally did the smart thing and added a Fastex clip so that the collar can be quickly taken on and off without removing the dog's ears in the process. Maggie hasn't commented yet but it seems really comfortable and is very rugged. And best of all, you can toss it in the washing machine when your dog is done running through a muddy field. The fleece band is accented with a vibrant contrasting collar (Maggie got the pine fleece/purple combo and a purple/gold as a backup when her favorite is in the wash), is completely adjustable, and has a spot for tags. The collars come in small (16"), medium (22"), large (28"), and a wide choice of colors and some prints. They're available from EBU Designs (191 Stillwater Ave., Orono, ME 04473; 207/866-2852) and cost $12.50 (includes shipping and handling), but mention MOTHER and get $3 off.</p><h3>Environmentally-Friendly Styrofoam?</h3><p>They look very appealing on Christmas morning, covering the floor around the tree in delicate drifts of white, amazingly like the snow outside. But their charm may wear off when it's time to clean up. Styrofoam packing pieces are light and very durable, perfect for the job for which they were designed, but environmentally dangerous: Polystyrene does not decompose for extended periods in landfills, and gives off harmful gases and toxins when it does. An alternative to this material, which threatens to snow us in and crowd us out, is being introduced by the American Excelsior Company.</p><h3>Once the ship is docked, the plastics are unloaded and turned into nifty, government-approved park benches.</h3><p>It's called Eco-Foam, and it looks and performs exactly like its Styrofoam counterpart but is made of 95% cornstarch. After use (or several uses), disposal of Eco-Foam is as easy as dropping it into a compost pile, where it will decompose within a few hours. An even quicker method is to add a bit of water and pour the packing down the sink. Once mixed with water, Eco-Foam dissolves in seconds and leaves no harmful residue. For the EcoFoam distributor nearest you, call 800/7777645. They'll be sure to rush the stuff so you can have a white Christmas after all.</p><h3>Shipboard Recycling</h3><p>The Navy wants you to know that not only did it fight to free Kuwait, it's now fighting to free our oceans from pollutants. With several new programs in the works, the Navy hopes to reduce the dumping of plastics at sea by 70%. Among the new measures is a plasticwaste processor that will turn used plastics into usable products such as park benches. According to a Navy spokesperson, the plastic materials are compacted and stored aboard ship. Once it docks, the plastics are unloaded and taken to a processing plant where they are turned into nifty, government-approved park benches. These benches have so far been distributed only to various Navy installations, but officials tell us they'll soon be appearing in public parks everywhere. Just another example of your tax dollars at work, folks.</p><h3>Take Two and Try the Next Lifetime</h3><p>Life is just one big headache for more than half of all American adults, according to the Excedrin Headache Report, a national study of 1,205 adults. More than half of those ages 20 to 49 say they are under more pressure than they were in the past and that nearly all aspects of life are headache-provoking. The top three causes of cranial pounders: "Not Getting Enough Sleep ... .. Too Much to Do in Too Little Time," and "Kids Are Getting on My Nerves." Well, we could have told them that. A few surprises: "Hectic Holidays" were the #15 cause of stress, and "Worries about Pollution" (#21) came in above both "International Conflicts" (#25) and "The Mother-in-Law" (#34), which can only lead us to believe that the environment is getting worse and mothers-in-law are getting better. Or maybe not.</p><h3>Just Say No to Solar Plant Turners</h3><p>One for the "pass it up" category: For the low, low price of $20.95, a New York company will send you a Solar Plant Turner. Promising an end to lopsided plants, the company claims the plant turner (which bears a suspicious resemblance to the lazy Susan plates of an earlier era with a bike reflector attached) will rotate up to 30 pounds of your precious flora, sucking juice only from the sun. For 20 bucks we'll stick to our own sun-powered plant turners-hands.</p><h3>"Survey Says" Number II</h3><p><em>Farm Futures,</em> in Minnetoka, Minnesota, recently surveyed a group of farmers and asked them what they'd do if they learned that their pesticide tank was spilling into a creek. Of all polled, a frightening 19% said they'd "wait and see if a problem developed" instead of taking action. Even more frightening: 9% said they'd just "do nothing."</p><h3>There's Something Fishy Going On</h3><p>No longer will fishing line be a cast-off among recyclable products. Berkley Inc., a fishing-gear manufacturer, lets consumers recycle their fishing line through 10,000 drop-off boxes nationally. The result, according to Berkley: 600,000 miles of fishing line have already been recycled-enough to circle the globe 24 times. Once deposited, the fishing line doesn't stray far from its original form-it's used for camping-lantern handles. boat-motor propellers, and yes, even handles for fishing reels.</p><p><em>Do you have any interesting, informative, or timely news from the field You'd like to share with other MOTHER readers ?
