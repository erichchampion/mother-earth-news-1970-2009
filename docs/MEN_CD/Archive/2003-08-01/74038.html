                    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne Vassal    </h5>    <p class="credit">      Photos by Claire Anderson    </p>        <p>      It would be nice if I could share with you the wondrous      aspects of my long time favorite skillet, but until      recently I didn't have one. Over the years, not a single      one ever stole my heart. Having a quality, 12-inch skillet      ought to be a necessity of life, though, along with shoes,      cell phones and brie (OK, maybe not brie), so finally, I      set out to find my "one and only."    </p>    <p>      As it turned out, I found several skillets that tickled my      fancy: Calphalon's Commercial and Kitchen Essentials lines,      All-Clad Metalcrafter's own brand (my favorite!) and      Emerilware, developed by All-Clad with celebrity chef      Emeril Lagasse. Here are the most important points to      consider when you're searching for skillet that will steal      your heart.    </p>    <h3>      SKILLET SHOP BUT NOT 'TILL YOU DROP    </h3>    <p>      Most all-purpose skillets have either flared or straight      sides. Those with flared sides are called <em>fry or      omelette pans</em> , and usually they come without lids;      food just slides right out of these pans and onto a plate.      Those with straight sides are called saute pans, and they      come with lids.    </p>    <p>      I decided to limit my spending to less than $150, although      it's possible to buy skillets that cost twice that price. I      tested numerous skillets for "release-ability" (whether the      food stuck to the pan), heat distribution and cooking time.      I cooked a variety of foods, including eggs, pancakes,      eggplant, plantains, tofu and chicken.    </p>    <p>      Appearance, durability, feel and whether the skillet was      oven- or broiler-safe also were evaluated.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Appearance.</strong> This may seem frivolous, but a      cookware's design is what initially will attract your      attention. Imagine how the pan will look in your kitchen,      on your stove. Evaluate its scratch-resistance. The best      skillets I tested were heavy-gauge metal pans with      stainless steel exteriors; they resisted scratches and      dents better than either black enamel or anodized aluminum      pans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Durability</strong> runs a close second to      appearance. All the skillets I liked were listed as      dish-washer safe, but company repre sentatives all      recommended hand-washing. Although better cookware will      come with a lifetime warranty, be sure to read the fine      print before you buy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Feel</strong> is an important consideration, too.      With the exception of cast iron pans, you shouldn't have to      pump iron to fry an egg. A skillet should be a comfortable      weight, but keep in mind that quality skillets are heavier      than bargain-basement pans. But don't confuse "heavy      weight" with "heavy gauge." "Gauge" is a measurement of the      thickness of the metal used in the cookware's construction,      not its weight.    </p>    <p>      Skillet handles will vary in feel, too, so test them out to      find which suits you best. Metal handles probably won't      feel quite as nice as wooden ones, but they will last      forever. For safety's sake, handles should have a "stay      cool" quality and be riveted through the pan rather than      screwed in place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Options</strong> such as oven-safe or broiler-safe      may be important to you, too. The skillets listed here are      oven-safe up to a certain temperature, but all are not      broiler-safe. If you love to brown your culinary creations      under the broiler, you'll want a broiler-safe skillet.    </p>    <p>      If you have an electric range, especially a smooth top,      you'll need a skillet that is ruler-flat on the bottom to      ensure uniform cooking. And, if you're buying an omelet or      fry pan, you also may want to find out whether a lid can be      purchased separately, even though most of the time you      won't need it.    </p>    <h3>      LET'S TALK METALS    </h3>        <p>      Priced at about $40, Calphalon's Kitchen<br />      Essentials skillet, above, was the least expensive<br />      of the finalists. All-Clad, the author's favorite      (see<br />      Page 98), was the most expensive at about $150.<br />    </p>    <p>      Most top-quality skillets today are made of aluminum,      anodized aluminum, stainless steel or, sometimes, copper,      or a combination of these. The material, and how the pan is      made, contribute to how well it conducts heat when you're      cooking with it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Anodized Aluminum.</strong> Anodizing is an      electrochemical process that makes aluminum nonporous,      nonreactive and 30 percent harder than stainless steel or      cast iron. The best heat conductors are aluminum and      copper, so the anodized pans have the same superior heat      conductivity as regular aluminum, but they do not react      with acid foods such as tomato sauce like an ordinary      aluminum pan will. Calphalon was the first company to      manufacture cookware with hard-anodized aluminum; such a      pan has a darkgray, matte finish. It is durable, but its      exterior can scratch and its cooking surface can discolor      because of high temperatures and baked-on food. Over time,      these pans can begin to look very dull; Calphalon advises      using Comet brand cleanser and a Scotch-brite scouring pad      to clean its hardanodized pans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stainless Steel.</strong> A few decades ago,      everything stuck to stainless skillets, but today, the      stick-resistant power of new, heavygauge stainless steel      pans is amazing. Stainless is one of the most durable      metals but not the best heat conductor, a critical factor      in cookware performance. Quality cookware combines      stainless steel with a better conductor, such as aluminum      or copper, which often is added to the bottom of the pan or      sandwiched between two layers of stainless and extended up      the sides. Stainless requires minimal care. It's easy to      clean as long as you don't bum food on the surface; avoid      high heat and let your food cook a little longer. To keep      your steel's reflective surface glowing, which nicely      compliments whatever is cooking, treat your stainless steel      with care - never clean your new stainless with steel      wool or an abrasive pad.    </p>    <h3>      LET'S TALK COOKING SURFACES    </h3>        <p>      Interior surface options of both anodized aluminum and      stainless steel skillets listed here are not nonstick, but      when small amounts of oil or fat are used, they're      stick-resistant. I expected the anodized aluminum to The      more stick-resistant than the stainless, but that wasn't      the case; food will stick to either surface. A Calphalon      representative explained that the anodized pan is great for      browning chicken and other meats because the best heat      conductor, aluminum, is in direct contact with the food.      With the stainless steel pan, the aluminum or copper is      underneath the stainless coating, producing a slightly      different result. But, will it cook the darned chicken?      Superbly, but differently.    </p>    <p>      Only a pan with an applied nonstick coating is truly      nonstick. When the nonstick coating Teflon was introduced      30 years ago, it was thin and easily scratched, but in      recent years, nonstick coating has improved so much it      accounted for 76 percent of cookware sales in 1999 in the      United States.    </p>    <p>      Nonstick pans are easy to clean, require little or no off      for cooking, and you'll never have to chisel your fish out      of one of these pan. But, if you're cooking without oil in      a nonstick pan for any reason, you'll find some foods burn      or dry out before they're fully cooked. Also, food takes      longer to cook in a nonstick pan because the coating      insulates the food from the heat.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes you'll want your food to stick - to brown      or caramelize, to do more than simply cook. If you've ever      picked only the crispy pieces out of a plate of fried      potatoes, you know what I mean Nonstick pans make mushy      fried potatoes because the added oil doesn't adhere to the      pans surface. It just forms fat puddles, and the food then      slurps up the Oil, defeating the pans low-fat purpose.    </p>    <p>      Today's quality nonstick skillets with heavy-gauge      exteriors are built to last, and often have lifetime      guarantees. To improve durability of the nonstick coating,      some companies have developed a thicker version by creating      a textured surface to which multiple layers of the coating      are applied. The idea is that the wear will occur on the      top of the bumps, preserving the nonstick surface      underneath.    </p>    <p>      Despite these improvements, nonstick, were not among my      favorites. Depending on the pan's exterior metal, nonsticks      don't heat up as quickly or brown foods as well as      stick-resistant pans. Nonsticks also require special      treatment: strictly forbidden are metal utensils, high      cooking temperatures, and the use of dishwashers or      abrasive cleaners.    </p>    <p>      According to a representative for one nonstick      manufacturer, All-Clad, nonstick skillets discolor because      of a buildup of food or of an oil residue both of which can      be cleaned away with a nylon pad and Bar Keepers Friend      cleanser. If the residue is burned on the surface, try      soaking the pan in denture cleaner and water!    </p>    <p>      If a nonstick pan is your choice, you'll need to decide      which exterior surface you prefer. I ruled out sorne      nonsticks with black anodized and brushed aluminum      exteriors because of concerns about scratch-resistance      based on the condition of store samples and reports from      owners.    </p>    <h3>      Cast Iron    </h3>    <p>      It's no wonder some folks swear by their trusty cast iron      skillets. Virtually indestructible, they cook fast once      they're heated and handle the highest temperatures with      ease. They're great for Cajun-style blackening; we use my      grandma's to blacken fish on the grill, and to make corn      bread in the oven. Iron skillets improve with age and can      last several lifetimes.    </p>    <p>      Secondhand 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillets can be better      than new ones. They're inexpensive, too, at $15 to $20 in      flea markets or antique shops, although the collectible      Wagner or Griswold brands usually will cost more.    </p>    <p>      The downside is these skillets are heavy, the handles get      hot and the food can stick if the cast iron isn't properly      seasoned or cleaned. There also can be problems with uneven      heating, and the reactive metal does absorb and release      food odors.    </p>    <p>      But on a Wisconsin winter's morning, I just love my      brother-in-law's fried potatoes, cooked in his favorite      16-inch iron skillet, on his wood-burning stove.    </p>    <h3>      The finalist    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Calphalon Kitchen Essentials about $40.</strong>      One of Calphalon's less expensive lines, it's sold      exclusively at Target. Various choices are available in      12-inch skillets, but the only one I'd buy is the hard      anodized with nonstick interior.

( www.Calphalon.com )    </p>    <p>      <strong>Calphalon, about $85.</strong> Calphalon has      created more lines than I could test, so I focused on the      company's best commercial skillets in hardanodized      aluminum.
