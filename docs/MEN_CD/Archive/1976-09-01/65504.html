                <p>      <em>Unless you know what you're doing, shopping for tools      can be a time- and money-consuming endeavor. To help you      with the task, here are a few words of wisdom from Doug      Richmond</em> <em>... a mechanic and tool buyer of many      years' experience.</em>    </p>        <p>      As anyone who's lived on a homestead or spent any time in      the back country knows all too well, today's "built to      last" mechanical contrivances break down with disconcerting      regularity. And when they do, someone (guess who?) must fix      them.    </p>        <p>      This holds for just about any contraption-with or      without moving parts-that you can think of Coleman      lanterns, corn-binder pickups, push cultivators,      rototillers ... you name it, and it's a leadpipe cinch that      throughout the item's useful life it'll have to be repaired      and/or adjusted over and over again. And of course, most of      that repairing and adjusting can only be done with the aid      of mechanics' hand tools.    </p>    <p>      I started my own collection of hand tools while living in a      cabin on Alaska's Gravina Island. We didn't have a whole      lot of mechanical devices to contend with up there in      America's "last frontier", but I was forced to tinker      almost daily with the weary old outboard that powered the      boat we used for running errands to Ketchikan. The      experience quickly taught me that quality hand tools were      (and are) embarrassingly expensive and I      resolved-then and there-never to buy one for      which I didn't have an immediate and specific need. Over      the years, as I've worked as a heavy-duty mechanic and      electrician, I've kept this vow religiously ... and never      regretted it. The problem most homesteaders run up against      is that it's often difficult to choose-from the      bewildering variety of tools on the market-exactly      the right implement for the task at hand (even if it is      obvious that 99.9% of those available are unsuitable for      the job to be done). Yet it is important to make the      correct choice, for mistakes in tool selection can be      expensive.    </p>        <p>      Of course, one way out of this quandary is to buy a      ready-made assortment of tools from a dealer. Anyone who      goes this route, however, soon begins to suspect that the      person who made up the selection got his master's degree in      fruit fly genetics and doesn't know the rust thing about      how to assemble a practical collection of tools.    </p>    <p>      How do you go about buying hand tools, then? This is a      tough question to answer, but-as a mechanic and      inveterate tool buyer with more than two decades'      experience-I feel qualified to offer some advice on      the subject. Here are a few suggestions:    </p>        <p>      Number one, when you first start purchasing tools study      every catalog in <em>the field</em> that you can put your      <em>hands on. (A</em> list of suppliers accompanies this      article.) Because thousands of different types of      mechanics' hand tools exist, it pays to have a good idea of      what's available before you go looking for a particular      item to do a given job. (ONE CAUTION: Read your catalogs      with a certain amount of skepticism. The folks who write      them sometimes dwell overlong on the good points of an item      while completely forgetting to mention its limitations.)    </p>    <p>      You'll find that the most economical way to buy tools is to      purchase them "pre-owned". Used tools depreciate about as      fast as used furniture, used spacecraft, etc.,      yet-unlike an old sofa or a Saturn rocket-a      quality wrench or screwdriver will last a lifetime if it's      not grossly abused. (Some of my tools were purchased      secondhand over 25 years ago and are still going strong.)      Flea markets are probably your best bet for used hand      tools. Beyond that, you might check auctions, swap meets,      or the classified section of your paper.    </p>    <p>      The next best way to obtain tools is buy them new from one      of the big mail-order houses, such as Sears, Roebuck and      Co. or Montgomery Ward. Not only are Sears's and Ward's      prices reasonable and their wares of good quality, but the      sales personnel are extremely accommodating when it Mines      to exchanging broken tools., (I've seen 1/2"-drive sockets      which had obviously been ruined by heating promptly and      courteously exchanged for new merchandise at a Sears      store.) An extra advantage of dealing with these leviathans      of the mailorder business is that you don't have to shop by      mail. If-as is often the case-you need a      certain tool right now, you can usually find a retail      outlet close by.    </p>        <p>      After the big catalog stores, your next choice when buying      new tools, I believe, should be an auto parts      establishment. The main disadvantage to doing business with      such firms is that many of them have very primitive      inventory control, which means that they're often "fresh      out" of an item when you need it the most. Also, the prices      at these stores are usually a little higher than at Sears      or Ward.    </p>    <p>      The absolute worst place to buy tools is from a peddler's      truck (you know, the kind that drives around and stops at      shops and factories). Not only are tools expensive when      purchased from a vendor, but too often the driver-salesman      objects loudly and strenuously to replacing a broken tool.      I've seen this happen even when the implement in question      was obviously defective in manufacture and-as a      result-failed within a week of purchase.    </p>    <p>      No matter where you shop for tools, you'll notice that no      one supplier will have all the pieces of equipment you need      or want. (One firm might sell everything except hacksaw      blades, while another might offer everything except socket      wrenches.) On this score, Snap-On Tools Corporation seems      to have the most complete line of products, with bears,      Ward, and Western Auto not far behind. Of course,      Snap-On-which is generally sold from a truck by a      traveling vendor-is also a good bit more expensive      than any of the latter three.    </p>    <p>      Which brings up another question: Does it pay to buy      premium tools ... tools made by firms-such as Snap-On-that      specialize in tool manufacture? The answer: in general, no.      The exception to this is the occasional instance in which a      certain premium tool is priced competitively with the      corresponding product from a lower-priced line, or when you      can't find a needed tool anywhere else but in a premium      tool manufacturer's catalog.    </p>        <p>      On the other hand, it's usually bad news to buy tools out      of the 98 cents jumble basket at the local lumberyard or      hardware. Usually these cheapies won't hold up well enough      to repair a wheelbarrow, which of course means that you      don't save any money in the long-or even the      short-run. (And just try asking about "replacement      warranties" after you've bent the blade on a putty-pointed      two-bit screwdriver!)    </p>    <p>      A final tip: Avoid special-purpose tools-the ones      made to do a specific job on a certain make and model of      machin-eexcept when the use of such a device is      absolutely unavoidable. In most cases, a standard tool can      do the job ... the special-purpose gadgets      <em>purportedly</em> do it better, that's all.    </p>    <p>      In closing, let me restate my belief that it takes a long      time-and a lot of capital-to build up a really      useful collection of tools for the homestead. So go slow,      buy only what you need when you need it, and insist on      quality whenever you do make a purchase. Before you know      it, you'll be equipped to handle any repair job on the      farm.    </p>    <h3>      ONE MAN'S TOOL KIT    </h3>    <p>      To give you an idea of the tools that a mechanic carries in      his own personal collection, here are the contents of my      field box. The following assortment of hand tools will cope      with almost all the mechanical repair work required to keep      the average home stead operative ... and that includes      everything from fixing leaky faucets to tearing down (and      putting back together) Poppin-Johnny tractors. Occasionally      I'll encounter a job for which I need an additional tool or      two, but that's the exception ... not the rule.    </p>     <h3>THE BOX</h3>     <p><strong>Snap-On brand heavy-duty field toolbox-9" X 9" X 21-1/4"-with tote tray.</strong></p>
