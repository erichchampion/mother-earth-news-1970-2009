                <p>      <strong>In MOTHER NO. 39, authors Shurtleff and Aoyagi      introduced us to the art of cooking with whole soybeans.      Below, we are taught how to prepare</strong> -      <strong>and serve</strong> - <strong>tofu</strong> .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by WILLIAM SHURTLEFF & AKIKO AOYAGI    </h5>    <p>      From <em>The</em> <em>Book of Tofu,</em> copyright 1975 by      William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi. Excerpts used by      permission of Autumn Press, Inc.    </p>    <h3>      MAKING TOFU AT HOME    </h3>        <p>      If you find that fresh tofu is not available at a nearby      store, try preparing your own at home using either whole      soybeans or powdered soymilk. It's as enjoyable as baking      bread ... and considerably faster.    </p>    <p>      We have found the following recipe, based on the      traditional Japanese farmhouse method, to be easy to follow      and virtually foolproof. The tofu will be ready 50 to 60      minutes after you start. One pound of soybeans yields about      3-1/2 to 4 pounds of tofu at a cost about one-third to      one-fourth that of commercial tofu and less than one-half      the cost (on a usable protein basis) of hamburger.      Solidified with <em>nigari</em> (the mineral-rich mother      liquor that remains after salt is extracted from seawater      ... also known as "bittern"), made from soymilk simmered      over an open fire (rather than steamed), and served at its      peak of freshness, homemade tofu contains a fullness of      flavor and subtle sweetness seldom found in even the finest      store-bought varieties.    </p>    <h3>      UTENSILS    </h3>    <p>      To make fine homemade tofu, you will need the following      common kitchen tools (see Fig. 1) and ingredients:    </p>    <p>      An electric blender, food or grain mill, or meat      grinder.<br />      A "pressing pot" with a capacity of 1-1/2 to 2 gallons, or      a basin of comparable size.<br />      A 2-quart saucepan.<br />      A wooden spatula, rice paddle, or wooden spoon with a long      handle.<br />      A shallow ladle or dipper about 1 inch deep and 3 or 4      inches in diameter, or a large spoon.<br />      A rubber spatula<br />      A sturdy 1 -quart jar or a potato masher<br />      A 1-cup measuring cup<br />      A set of measuring spoons.<br />      A large, round-bottomed colander (that will fit into the      "pressing pot").<br />      A flat-bottomed colander ("settling container") preferably      square or rectangular.<br />      A shallow fine-mesh strainer or bamboo colander.<br />      (zeru)<br />      A coarsely woven cotton dishcloth, 2 feet square, or a      "pressing sack".<br />      A 2-foot square of cheesecloth, or a light cotton dish      towel of comparable dimensions.    </p>        <p>      Two special pieces of equipment, both easy to assemble,      will make the work even easier:    </p>    <p>      [1] Make a "pressing sack" of the coarsely woven cotton      dish towel mentioned above, or use a piece of sturdy cotton      cloth with about the same coarseness of weave as      cheesecloth. Fold the towel or cloth end to end and sew up      the sides to form a sack about 15 inches wide and 15 inches      deep. Or use a small flour sack with a fairly coarse weave.    </p>    <p>      [2] The flat-bottomed colander listed above is for use as a      "settling container" which gives its shape to the finished      tofu. If a 1-quart strainer or small, round-bottomed      colander is used in its place, the tofu will naturally be      rounded.    </p>    <p>      The three settling containers shown in Fig. 2 can easily be      made at home. Container A is prepared from a 1-1/2-quart      wooden, Tupperware, or plastic box with an open top and      non-removable bottom. In containers B and C the bottom is      removable, allowing for easy removal of the tofu without      immersing the container in water. Good dimensions for the      container are 5-1/2 inches square by 3 inches deep, or 8 by      4 by 3 inches deep. Use a drill or heated ice pick to bore      3/8-inch-diameter holes about 1-1/2 inches apart in the      bottom and sides of the container. Fashion a flat wooden or      plastic pressing lid (with or without holes) to fit down      inside the rim of the box. Handmade wooden settling      containers in the above designs (kitchen or community size)      can be ordered from Ganesha, c/o Westbrae Natural Foods,      1336 Gilman St., Berkeley, Calif. 94706.    </p>    <h3>      SOYBEANS    </h3>    <p>      The soybeans now sold at almost all natural and health food      stores, most co-op stores, and many supermarkets will make      good tofu. However, to obtain the highest yield, try buying      soybeans directly from a tofu shop (if there's one in your      area), for they have been carefully chosen by the tofu      maker.    </p>    <h3>      SOLIDIFIER    </h3>    <p>      The solidifiers; most readily available in the West are      Epsom salts, lemon or lime juice, and vinegar. All make      delicious tofu, although they are not used in Japanese tofu      shops. Japanese-style solidifiers are available from many      natural food stores, local tofu shops, Japanese food      markets, chemical supply houses (check your phone      directory), or your local school chemistry lab. Usable      seawater can be retrieved from clean stretches of ocean.      Natural nigari is available at some salt refineries and can      be ordered from Japanese natural food distributors ... or      it can be prepared at home using natural salt. We recommend      the use of refined nigari unless the natural nigari is      certified to have come from a clean source of seawater.      While we believe the nigari-type solidifiers are the      easiest to use and result in the best tasting tofu, Epsom      salts and calcium sulfate seem to give somewhat higher bulk      yields and a softer end product by incorporating more water      into the tofu. The yield of tofu solids or nutrients is      about the same regardless of the type of solidifier used,      except that lemon juice and vinegar give rather small      yields. ( <strong>NOTE:</strong> Calcium sulfate, a fine      white powder, is sometimes mislabeled in the West and sold      as nigari. The latter usually has a coarse, granular, or      crystalline texture ... natural nigari is beige and refined      nigari is white.)    </p>    <p>      The recipe below calls only for solidifier Your choice of      solidifier depends upon the type of tofu you want.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOR SUBTLY SWEET, NIGARI TOFU</strong> USE: 1-1/4      teaspoons magnesium chloride or calcium chloride, or 1to      1-1 /2 teaspoons granular or powdered natural nigari, or 1      to 1-3/4 teaspoons homemade liquid nigari, or 1-1/4 to 3      teaspoons commercially prepared liquid nigari, or 1 cup      seawater (freshly collected).    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOR MILD, SOFT TOFU USE:</strong> 1-1/4 teaspoons      Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) or calcium sulfate.    </p>    <p>      FOR SUBTLY TART OR SLIGHTLY SOUR TOFU USE: 2-1/2      tablespoons lemon or lime juice (freshly squeezed), or 2      tablespoons (apple cider) vinegar.    </p>        <h3>      HOME MADE TOFU<br />      (MAKES 22 TO 26 OUNCES)    </h3>    <p>      1 cup soybeans, washed, soaked in 4 cups water for 10 hours      (see graph, MOTHER NO. 39, page 40), rinsed, and      drained<br />      11 cups water, approximately<br />      Solidifier    </p>    <p>      Prepare in advance:    </p>    <p>      Place pressing pot in sink and set colander into pot.      Moisten pressing sack lightly and line colander with sack,      fitting mouth of sack around rim of colander. Or line      colander with a moistened 2-foot-square dish towel (Fig.      3).    </p>    <p>      Moisten cheesecloth or thin cotton dish towel and use to      line bottom and sides of settling container. Place      container on rim of large bowl or pan placed in sink.    </p>    <p>      Fill a 2-quart saucepan with 2 cups water and warm over      very low heat on a side burner.    </p>    <p>      After making the above preparations, proceed as follows:    </p>    <p>      Heat 5 cups water over high heat in cooking pot. While      water is heating, combine beans and 2-2/3 cups water in a      blender and purée at high speed for about 3 minutes,      or until very smooth. (if using a grain mill, food mill, or      meat grinder, grind beans without adding water and add      2-2/3 cups more water to cooking pot.)    </p>    <p>      Add soybean purée (gô) to water heating (or      boiling) in cooking pot, rinsing out blender with a little      water to retrieve any puree that may cling to blender's      walls. Taking care that pot does not boil over, continue      heating on high heat, stirring bottom of pot frequently      with a wooden spatula or spoon to prevent sticking (Fig.      4). When foam suddenly rises in pot, quickly turn off heat      and pour contents of cooking pot into pressing sack (Fig.      5). Using a rubber spatula, retrieve any soybean      purée that may still cling to the sides of the      cooking pot and transfer to pressing sack. Quickly rinse      out cooking pot and replace on top of stove.    </p>    <p>      Twist hot pressing sack closed. Using a glass jar or potato      masher, press sack against colander, expressing as much      soymilk as possible (Fig. 6). Open sack, shake      <em>okara</em> (soybean pulp) it contains into one of its      corners, close and press again. Now empty <em>okara</em>      into the 2 cups warm water in saucepan on side of stove ...      stir well, then return moistened okara to pressing sack set      in the colander. Close sack and press well as before;      squeeze by hand to express the last of the soymilk (Fig.      7). Empty okara into the 2-quart pot and set aside.    </p>    <p>      Measure solidifier into dry 1-cup measuring cup and set      aside.    </p>    <p>      Pour soymilk into cooking pot and bring to a boil over high      heat, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Reduce heat      to medium and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Turn off heat.    </p>    <p>      Add 1 cup water to solidifier in measuring cup (unless      using seawater) and stir until dissolved. With a to-and-fro      movement, stir soymilk vigorously 5 or 6 times and, while      stirring, pour in 1/3 cup solidifier solution. Stir 5 or 6      times more, making sure to reach bottom and sides of pot.      Bring spoon to a halt upright in soymilk and wait until all      turbulence ceases. Lift out spoon (Fig. 8). Sprinkle 1/3      cup solidifier over surface of soymilk, cover pot, and wait      3 minutes while curds form. Using a measuring spoon, stir      remaining 1/3 cup solidifier solution, uncover pot, and      sprinkle solution over surface of soymilk.    </p>    <p>      Very slowly stir upper 1/2-inch-thick layer of curdling      soymilk for 15 to 20 seconds, then cover pot and wait 3      minutes. (Wait 6 minutes if using Epsom salts or calcium      sulfate). Uncover and stir surface layer again for 20 to 30      seconds, or until all milky liquid curdles.    </p>    <p>      (White "clouds" of delicate curds should now be floating in      a clear, pale-yellow liquid . . . the whey. If any milky,      uncurdled liquid remains suspended in whey, wait I minute,      then stir gently until curdled. If milky liquid persists,      dissolve a small amount of additional      solidifier-about 1/4 of the original amount-in      1/3 cup water and pour directly into uncurdled portions.      Stir gently until curdled.)    </p>    <p>      Place cooking pot next to settling container in sink.      Gently press fine-mesh strainer into pot and allow several      cups whey to collect in it. Ladle all of this whey into      settling container to re-moisten lining cloths (Fig. 9).      Set strainer aside.    </p>    <p>      Now ladle curds-and any remaining whey-into      settling container one layer at a time. Ladle gently so as      not to break curds' fragile structure (Fig. 10). Fold edges      of cloth neatly over curds (Fig. 11), place a lid on top of      cloth (a small board or flat plate will do), and set a 1/2-      to 1-1/2-pound weight on top of lid for 10 to 15 minutes,      or until whey no longer drips from settling container (Fig.      12).    </p>    <p>      Fill pressing pot, a large basin, or sink with cold water.      Remove weight and lid from atop tofu, then place container      holding tofu into basin of water (Fig. 13). Slowly invert      container, leaving cloth-wrapped tofu in water. Lift out      container. While it is still under water, carefully unwrap      and cut tofu crosswise into halves. Allow tofu to remain      under water for 3 to 5 minutes, until firm. To lift out,      slip a small plate under each piece of tofu. Drain briefly      (Fig. 14).    </p>    <p>      Store tofu in a cool place until ready to serve. (if not to      be served for 8 to 10 hours, store under cold water.) The      remaining 6 to 7 ounces (1 firmly packed cup) of okara can      be used in various other recipes, or refrigerated in an      airtight container. Use the 6 to 7 cups whey in stocks      and/or for washing your utensils.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: In next issue's installment of excerpts      from this great book, we'll present various recipes that'll      show you what to do with your tofu once its made.</em>    </p>    <h3>      ---more about tofu ---    </h3>    <p>      Just as the word "bread" is used in reference to a wide      variety of baked goods, the word "tofu" in its broad sense      refers to a number of different soybean foods.    </p>    <p>      "Tofu" is also used in a more limited sense to refer to      "regular tofu", the simplest, least expensive variety and      the one most widely known in the West. This tofu has no      exact equivalent in Western cuisine and does not quite fit      the English terms "soybean curd" and "soybean cheese" often      used to describe it Tofu is made <em>from</em> soybean      curds just as cheese is made <em>from</em> dairy curds:      after ladling off whey from the soymilk curds in his      curding barrel, the tofu maker scoops the curds into two      cloth-lined wooden settling boxes and tops them with a      pressing lid and heavy weight for about thirty minutes.      During this time the curds are firmed and made into tofu.      Similarly, although the finished tofu, stored under water      in deep sinks, has the color and shape of a light cheese,      it is not fermented, aged, or ripened ... hence the name      "soybean cheese" is also inappropriate.    </p>    <p>      According to ancient Chinese references, as well as to      popular tradition, the method for preparing both soymilk      and tofu was discovered by Lord Liu An of Huai-nan in about      164 B.C. A famous scholar and philosopher, ruler and      politician, Liu An is said to have been interested in      alchemy and Taoist meditation. A close friend of many      students, he may have undertaken his experiments 'With tofu      as a way of introducing nutritious variety into their      simple meatless diet. Historians believe that Liu An's tofu      was probably solidified with either nigari or seawater and      had a firm texture similar to most of the tofu made in      China today.    </p>    <p>      About 900 years passed from the time of the discovery of      tofu in China until its arrival in Japan. (As tofu became a      part of the language and culture in Japan it came to be      used in proverbs and sayings. When someone wants to tell a      person to "get lost", he may say "Go bump your head against      the corner of a cake of tofu and drop dead." Or when      speaking of something as being hopeless he might say "It's      as futile as trying to clamp two pieces of tofu together.")    </p>    <p>      Up until the start of World War II, virtually all Japanese      tofu was prepared in small household shops from gô      <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> see The Book of Tofu excerpts in      <em>MOTHER NO. 40.</em> cooked over a wood fire in an iron      cauldron and soymilk solidified with natural nigari. Only      after World War II did new solidifiers (such as calcium      sulfate) and ways of cooking (such as with pressurized      steam) come into vogue. In recent years, large shops and      factories have begun to mass-produce tofu: each 10-1/2      ounce cake is water-packed in a polyethylene container,      thermally sealed with a sheet of transparent film, and      pasteurized by immersion for one hour in hot water to give      a shelf life of up to 1 week. Distributed over an area of      several hundred miles in refrigerated trucks, this tofu is      sold in supermarkets and neighborhood grocery stores at a      price slightly below that of the tofu sold in most      neighborhood shops.    </p>    <p>      Another 1,200 years passed before tofu made the leap from      Japan to America ... where there are now more than 50 tofu      shops, the oldest of which has been in business since the      turn of the century. The history of tofu in the West,      therefore, has only just begun.    </p>    <h3>      news from bill shurtleff<br />      ---AND AKIKO AOYAGI---    </h3>    <p>      Bill Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi-talented authors of <em>The      Book of Tofu</em> -recently wrote to MOTHER and asked us if      we'd pass along the following two announcements.    </p>    <p>      First: In response to a gratifyingly large number of      invitations, Mr. Shurtleff and Ms. Aoyagi will tour the      U.S. this fall, giving special lecture presentations to      natural food centers, student body organizations, clubs,      etc.... and they'd like to hear from any such groups that      would be interested in having them come and talk. According      to Bill Shurtleff, "At a typical two-hour program, we      prepare a number of our favorite tofu and miso recipes for      people to sample, teach others how to make tofu at home for      13 cents per pound, talk about the highprotein nutritional      value of these fine foods, and discuss the important role      they can play in helping to solve the world food crisis."      All Bill and Akiko ask of sponsoring organizations is a      donation of one dollar per person-in-attendance, to cover      expenses. Interested parties are encouraged to write to the      address below.    </p>    <p>      Second: Authors Shurtleff and Aoyagi are putting together a      new <em>volume-The Book of Sea Vegetables</em> -      <em>and</em> would like very much to contact folks in this      country who've [A] developed good sea-vegetable recipes or      [B] gathered and/or cultivated edible seaweeds extensively.      If you've got such recipes, or info on foraging seaweed      (name of variety, habitat, season to harvest, flavor, use      in cookery, etc.), by all means send what you know to Bill      and Akiko. They'll acknowledge your help in the book, and      maybe list your name in the appendix under "People      Interested in Sea Vegetables in the West".    </p>    <p>      Write to Bill Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi at:    </p>    <p>      New Age Foods Study Center<br />      790 Los Palos Manor<br />      Lafayette, Calif. 94549    </p>    <p>      "We hope that <em>The</em> <em>Book</em> <em>of Sea      Vegetables</em> will long be the definitive work on the      subject," author Shurtleff tells MOTHER. All we can say is,      if the new volume is executed in anywhere near the      professional and thorough-going manner of <em>The</em>      <em>Book</em> <em>of Tofu,</em> it ought to be a classic.    </p>
