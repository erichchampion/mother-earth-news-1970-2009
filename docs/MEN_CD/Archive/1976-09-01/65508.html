                       <p>      In MOTHER NO. 35 (see "Cornhusk Dolls for Fun and Profit",      pages 38 <em>-</em> 43), Nancy Bubel told us how to      make and market two kinds of dolls <em>-</em>      traditional and contemporary <em>-</em> from nothing      but the paper <em>-</em> like shucks taken from ears      of corn. And they're dandy little dolls too. "But wait a      minute," says Charlene Berryman. "Down here in Texas, where      I live, my family makes another kind of doll ... from the      <em>whole</em> ear of corn. And here's how we do it."    </p>    <h3>HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED:</h3>    <p>      To make our country dolls you'll need <em>-</em>      first of all <em>-</em> some well-formed and filled      out ears of corn complete with shucks. The best time to      gather them from the field usually runs from late August,      through September and October, and into early November.      After that, the husks (on any corn that still hasn't been      picked) sometimes starts to get a little ragged looking. If      your ears have any evidence of weevils, wrap them in      plastic and store them in a freezer for two or three days.    </p>    <p>      In the meantime, you can round up the other materials and      tools you'll need: a paring knife, an old towel, scissors,      soft lead pencil, heavy twine, white thread, clear varnish,      tempera or acrylic paints, a small jar, large paper cup,      old toothbrush, and a pan (large enough to soak an ear of      corn in).    </p>        <h3>STEP ONE: SOAK THE CORN</h3>    <p>      When you're ready to begin the construction of a doll,      start by soaking an ear of corn in warm water for ten      minutes. Then <em>-</em> once they've softened      <em>-</em> gently pull its shucks back (one at a      time), and thoroughly clean them. Tear off and discard any      of the outer husks that are tattered or discolored and      scrub the kernels underneath with the old toothbrush. The      ear can then be laid aside (six hours outside or 24 hours      indoors) until it has completely dried.    </p>    <h3>STEP TWO:</h3>    <p>      Remove a band of kernels (approximately one inch wide) from      both the "neck" and "waist" of the ear of corn. (Use the      paring knife, if you have to, to pick the grains away from      the cob ... but be careful!) Then spray or brush clear      varnish over the remaining kernels to preserve them and      protect them from insects. Do <em>not paint the      shucks.</em> When you've finished, hang the ear up by its      husks and let it dry. (If possible, all of Step Two is best      done outside or in a workshop.)    </p>    <h3>STEP THREE:</h3>    <p>      Soak the shucks (and shucks only) of your ear of corn in      water until they become soft and pliable. Then spread an      old towel on a work surface and <em>-</em> keeping      everything over it <em>-</em> cut two pieces of twine      (each approximately nine inches long) and six lengths      (again, nine inches each) of thread.    </p>    <p>      While holding the ear of corn in one hand, use the other to      pull its shucks down <em>-</em> one at a time      <em>-</em> until the kernels of corn are covered all      the way around. <em>Don't pull all the sections of husk      down. Leave some loose for the braids and bangs you 'll      make later.</em>    </p>    <p>      Tie one piece of twine around the pulled-down shucks at      your ear's "neck". Then, leaving enough shucks on each side      of the developing doll to tie into "arms", smooth the rest      of the pulled-down husks past the doll's "waist" . . . and      tie them there with the second piece of twine.    </p>   <h3>STEP FOUR:</h3>    <p>      Tie the finished arms off at the elbows and wrists so that      they're each about four inches long (this will take a total      of four lengths of thread).    </p>    <h3>STEP FIVE:</h3>    <p>      Temporarily stand your doll in a small jar and      <em>-</em> using the smoothest side of the shuck      <em>-</em> covered ear for the face <em>-</em>      start to form the toy's bangs and braids. A single section      of shuck is usually just right for the bangs ... but you      can always split one if it's too wide, or combine two      narrow ones.    </p>    <p>      Pull another layer of the husk around to the back of the      doll's head for braids. Then gently tear off the remaining      shucks and lay them aside (you may want to use them later      for a broom). Split the shucks that you intend to braid      into 12 (six for each side) one-half-inch strips. Then      combine the 12 strips into six doubles and <em>-</em>      using three of the doubled strips for each one      <em>-</em> braid the two pigtails and tie them off      with your two remaining lengths of thread.    </p>    <p>      Turn the doll around at this point, trim its bangs (just      above where the eyes will be painted on the face) with      scissors and then fringe the bangs by cutting them      vertically at intervals of one-quarter inch. Finally, set      the doll outside about three hours or out of the way      indoors for 12 hours to allow the husk pigtails, face,      etc., to completely dry.    </p>    <h3>STEP SIX:</h3>    <p>      A simple mouth, nose, eyes, and lashes can be painted on      the dried doll with. either tempera or acrylics. Once the      paint has set, invert a large paper cup, cut an "X" across      its bottom, and push the doll down into the upside-down      container to within about one inch of "her" waist. The      finished toy or display should stand approximately 10      inches tall.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE. Once you've constructed Charlene's basic      doll, you can let your imagination run wild. Dress her up      as a little girl ... as a granny. . . even as a "doll". If      you have trouble getting started just send $2.00 to      Charlene Berryman, The Barnyard, Rt. 1, Box 41C Kingsbury,      Texas 78538 ... and she'll send you three big sheets of      dollmaking instructions and patterns for skirts,      petticoats, aprons, dresses, and bonnets ... just like the      ones you see here.</em>    </p>
