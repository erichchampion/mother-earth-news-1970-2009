                    <h5 id="byline">    by GORDON SOLBERG    </h5>        <p>      When we first moved to our ranch out here in Now Mexico, we      were so poor that we couldn't even afford a stove with an      oven. Oh, we had a stove all right ... a good old upright,      wood-burning model. And, with a roaring fire inside, its      top was fine for frying and great for boiling ... anything      that could be fried or boiled. But for baking breed, the      Ashley was zilch. And after more than a year of nothing but      skillet-broad, I finally got smart.    </p>    <p>      "After all," I asked myself one day, "what is an oven      anyway but an insulated container in which air can be      heated?"    </p>    <p>      "Why, nothing." I answered. "in fact, if you take away such      technological frills as automatic buzzers, built-in      thermometers, and self-cleaning cycles . . . that's      <em>all</em> that it is!"    </p>    <p>      Once I found that I agreed on the matter, the rest was      easy. So easy that, an hour later, I'd already built and      was ready to test our now oven. Not a very fancy one, to be      sure ... but an oven nevertheless. And what it lacks in      "pretty", it more than makes up in economy (since about the      only money I spent while fabricating our admittedly homely      "baking box" was for the few  cents' worth of gasoline I      used while scrounging up the little beauty's materials).    </p>    <p>      The oven's body is a five-gallon shortening can, which we      picked up free at a friendly hamburger stand. I sawed off      one end of the container with a hacksaw, then reattached it      with a couple of spring hinges and a few sheet metal      screws. Voila! The spring-loaded hinges always close the      door automatically ... thereby eliminating the need for      even the simplest latch.    </p>    <p>      I next drove over to the county dump and, after just a few      minutes of scrounging, found exactly what I needed to      insulate the bake box: a large sheet of one-inch-thick      fiberglass, complete with fail facing land absolutely free      for the taking).    </p>    <p>      Within minutes of my arrival back home, I had cut the      insulation to fit around the top and sides (but not the      bottom!) of the can (my only tool: scissors) and secured      the fiberglass in place (foil side in) with a few odd      pieces of wire that I had around the place. We were ready      for some homebaked bread!    </p>    <p>      The oven is "turned on" merely by setting it on top of our      old Ashley space heater at any time the stove contains a      live fire. And does that insulated box ever heat up! We      burned a lot of bread in it until we learned to keep the      blaze low in the Ashley <em>and</em> to slip large enough      metal supports in under the container to keep its bottom      raised about a half-inch above the stove's top. Now, with a      little careful watching (about the same amount that the      oven on any wood-burner requires), we can turn out perfect      baked goods nearly every time.    </p>    <p>      We use the little homemade oven the heaviest during the      winter . . when we have our strongest hankerin' for heavier      victuals, and when the ole Ashley is fired up anyway. (We      just lean back and warm our toes and bake biscuits at the      same time.)    </p>    <p>      Folks who drop by generally like the elegantly rustic      simplicity of our do-it- yourself bake box. And we like the      fact that, after a solid year of almost ai y use, we      haven't had the first piece of chrome fall off the      "appliance" . . . nor has a single thyristor circuit      shorted out in any of its temperature minder controls (us)!    </p>
