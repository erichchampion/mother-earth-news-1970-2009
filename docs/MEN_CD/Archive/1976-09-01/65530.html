                   <h5 id="byline">    by GARY C. BROWN    </h5>       <p>      Vern Cope's article, "Living on a Slope" (MOTHER NO. 29,      page 42), was a good one ... but it did set me to thinking      about the hazards of building on such a plot. Near where I      live in Denver, for instance, $75,000 houses are currently      sliding off mountains on their way to parts unknown. Before      you run off, buy a "bargain" piece of hillside, and start      constructing the home of your dreams on it, then, you      should know how to determine whether or not that slanted      acreage is <em>suitable</em> for the use to which you      intend to put it.    </p>    <h3>ALL SLOPES MOVE... AT LEAST A LITTLE</h3>      <p>      Any hillside suffers a form of erosion known as <em>mass      wasting</em> <em>. This</em> movement can take either the      form of a violent landslide (which, obviously, can be      catastrophic) or a slow creep (which, over a longer period      of time and <em>not so</em> obviously, can be just as      catastrophic). You should learn to recognize the evidence      left behind by both kinds of land movement and to predict      the probability of such movements in the future.    </p>   <h3>LANDSLIDES</h3>    <p>      Landslides that have already happened come in two      varieties: old and fresh. And you should run-not      walk-from any real estate agent who shows you either      type. Anyone who builds on a known landslide (old or new)      is asking for trouble. The added weight of a house and the      addition of water (on the lawn, on a garden, in a sewage      disposal system, etc.) can reactivate even a long-dormant      landslide with disastrous results. And there you'll go to      the bottom of the hill, with your new home in splinters      around you!    </p>    <p>      Fig.1 shows a typical landslide and its most recognizable      scars. Whether fresh or hundreds of years old, any slide      you inspect should exhibit some or all of these      characteristics:    </p>    <p>      [A] SCARP. This is a cut in a hillside where a mass of      earth once pulled out of the slope. On a fresh slide, the      scarp will have the appearance of a recent excavation. On      an older one, the cut may appear to be nothing but an      innocent, shallow, rounded depression on the side of the      hill. Beware. Such a depression is sometimes not as      innocent as it first looks.    </p>    <p>      [B] SAG PONDS. Water tends to accumulate in the depressions      formed on the surface of a landslide. This is most evident      where the slide meets the base of the scarp.    </p>    <p>      [C] FRACTURES. As a mass of earth slides down a slope, its      surface is often ruptured into numerous cracks and      fissures.    </p>    <p>      [D] HILLY SURFACE. When a landslide comes to rest, it      slumps and-to varying degrees-is compacted.      This creates a hilly area that is often in marked contrast      to the surrounding, undisturbed portions of the slope.    </p>    <p>      [E] VEGETATION. The surface of any landslide-new or      old-usually differs a great deal (especially around      the bottom of the shifted mass of earth) from the topsoil      of adjacent, undisturbed portions of the hillside. And this      "new" surface (formerly subsoil) frequently supports a      community of plants that is noticeably different from the      vegetation growing on the surrounding slope. In short, a      lobe-shaped area of low shrubs, brush, and smaller trees      amongst a hillside of older and taller trees might very      well be all the "sign" you need to tell you that a      landslide has taken place sometime in the past. Be alert      for such clues.    </p>    <h3>SLOW CREEP</h3>    <p>      Unlike landslides, which let you know in a most dramatic      way when they move, the downslope creep of the earth and      rocks on a hillside is just what the name implies . . .      slow, deceptive, and insidious. Once started, it's also      inexorable . . . and anyone who tries to pit the foundation      of a house against the gradual slide of thousands of tons      of soil is very foolish indeed.<br />      <br />      It's much more difficult to detect a creeping slope than it      is to spot an old or a new landslide . . . but it can be      done. Look for these signs:    </p>    <p>      [A] TREES WITH BENT TRUNKS. As soil inches down a hillside,      the top layers of the dirt will generally move faster than      lower layers of the shifting mass of earth. This can cause      trees growing in the creep to be deformed as shown in Fig.      2.    </p>    <p>      [B] TILTED POLES. The same action that bends tree trunks on      a creeping slope can also force telephone and other utility      poles to increasingly lean downhill (see Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      [C] DISPLACED FENCE LINES. Fig. 3 shows what happens when a      fence is run across a creep zone. The section of posts and      wire within the moving mass of earth will-over a      period of time-"walk" right down the hill with the      sliding soil. It's quite easy to see the resulting "sag" in      the fenceline.    </p>    <h3>SO . . .</h3>      <p>      Although the whole planet is plastic and its mass is      constantly changing, most of these changes take place so      slowly that-for all practical purposes-we can      ignore them. A great many hillsides and mountain slopes,      for example (although constantly and forever pulled      downward by gravity), erode at such an imperceptible pace      that their gradual wearing away need not concern us. We can      lay foundations on their slopes and construct buildings on      their faces with little more thought and skill than if we      were erecting the same structures on level land.    </p>    <p>      If, for some reason, you do want to put up a building or      establish a homestead on a mountainside or steep hill,      however, you're wise to positively acquaint yourself with      the signs of troublesome mass wasting <em>first</em> ...      before you make even the down payment on your 'dream" patch      of slanted soil. The shifting of millions of tons of      earth-in the form of either a sudden landslide or a slow      creep-is more than a match for anything you're liable      to build plus any effort that you, your family, your dog,      and your mule-all together-are likely to      muster. Ignore the early warnings of mass wasting and you      endanger yourself, your whole homestead, and even some of      your downslope neighbors.    </p>
