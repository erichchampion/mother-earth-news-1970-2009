                        <p>      <em>Michael Phillips has written the definitive book on      organic apple growing,</em> The Apple Grower. <em>He tends      Lost Nation Orchard</em> ( www.herbsandapples.com ) <em>in      the White Mountains of New Hampshire with his wife, Nancy,      and their daughter, Gracie. In the following piece,      Phillips answers the most common questions about backyard      apple growing.</em>    </p>    <p>      -MOTHER    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING STARTED</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Are homegrown apples really any      bet</em> <em>ter than what I get at the      supermarket?<br /></em> <strong>MP:</strong> Supermarkets      typically offer sweet, bland varieties imported from large      commercial orchards. No words to describe flavor come to      mind when you bite into a supermarket apple. Venture out to      a neighborhood orchard during the harvest season and you      should find regional favorites and heirloom varieties far      more intriguing.    </p>    <p>      Additionally, how apples are grown has a considerable      impact on both the flavor and the nutrient density of the      fruit. Trees planted in an herbicide strip braced with      soluble chemical fertilizers do not yield the same      delightful fare as trees sharing a well-composted soil in a      diversified ecosystem.    </p>    <p>      Now, imagine sitting under that tree, from which you just      picked that apple, sighing happily and biting into its      juicy, tangy perfection and realizing that you grew this      gift of nature your very own self. I don't see it getting      any better than that.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What are the top recommended      varieties for beginners? Any regional      differences?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Recall the greatest tasting locally      grown apples you've ever encountered, consult a nursery to      be sure the varieties you like will ripen in your climate      and then plant the varieties that suit on both counts.      Seriously, I think too much emphasis can be placed on the      disease resistance of more-recent cultivars, though apples      such as 'William's Pride' and 'Gold Rush' certainly are      worth that fanfare. A favorite of mine is 'Sweet      Sixteen'-delightfully crisp with a pleasing nutty      flavor, and yet here's a tree that tends toward an      undesirable vertical branch structure (although training in      its early years will produce a proper crotch angle).      Heirloom apples such as 'Roxbury Russet' and 'Baldwin' may      tend towards biennial bearing (every other year) but, oh,      are those "on" years worth the wait. Lastly, the shamrock      green fruits of Reinette Simirenko' are as tart as a good      'Granny Smith,' but juicier, and with a lovely citrus      twist.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> How big of a hole do I need to dig      for planting a tree?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The size of the tree hole needs to be      large enough to accommodate the roots without bending them.      A 3-foot diameter hole generally fits the bill. Aim to keep      the graft 2 inches above the soil line.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Should I add any amendments to the      soil at planting time?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Forget the advice about mixing compost      with the soil in the planting hole. I backfill the hole      with only its own soil, plus a dusting of 1 pound of rock      phosphate to assure early root development. The tree's      nutrition in the years ahead will come from above to feed      the top 6 inches of soil, where 90 percent of the feeder      roots live.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Do I need to prune the trees I just      planted?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Whips (single-stem saplings) are      headed back at planting time more severely than a feathered      tree that already has developed branches. A 1-year-old whip      is snipped off about 3 feet above the ground. This helps      compensate for lost roots as well as invigorating the      lateral buds. When newly planted trees are not cut back      severely enough, they often develop laterals well above the      desired heading height. On a feathered tree, the central      leader should be cut back 6 inches above the highest branch      being kept.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What rootstock do you recommend for      a backyard planting?</em><br />      <strong>MP</strong> : Nondwarfed or "standard" apple trees      can grow up to 30 feet high and 30 feet in diameter if not      pruned. As a consequence, most people prefer to plant apple      trees that have been grafted onto dwarfing rootstock. These      trees are easier to prune and pick, but need to be staked      because their roots tend to be brittle and grow shallowly.      They also should not be planted in wet locations, as they      are susceptible to collar rot. All dwarf trees can be kept      pruned to a manageable size, though the more vigorous the      rootstock, the more pruning you'll have to do. Dwarfing      rootstock "EMLA 26" produces a 10-foot to 12-foot tree that      is a little tall for easy harvest, but generally begins to      bear fruit in three years. "Malling 9" and "Geneva 16"      dwarf rootstocks make trees that grow 6 feet to 8 feet      tall, so all branches stay within easy reach for pruning,      spraying and harvesting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRUNING</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Pruning daunts me. What should I be      thinking about when I go to trim my trees?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> I have a pruning mantra that directs      my thoughts to the task at hand: "Framework first. Then the      thinning. Lastly see the fruit and where it grows."      Emphasize good form from the start and you'll avoid having      too many polelike limbs crowding each other down the road.      An artful pruner sees several years into the future in      developing bearing limbs to replace older wood. One old      farmer summed up the other tenet of good pruning quite      succinctly: "You know you did a good job if you can pick up      the family cow afterwards and throw her between the      branches." He was describing a big standard tree, but you      get the idea. Photosynthesis and good drying breezes      ideally will reach all the buds in the interior of a      well-pruned tree.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Q:</strong> <em>When should I prune?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Dormant season pruning is best done on      the tail end of winter. Folks in warmer growing zones can      start in January. Up here in northern New Hampshire, we get      out the pruning shears in the latter part of March.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What should be done with the branch      trimmings after pruning?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Chipping the branches to return them      to the soil right beneath the tree is ideal. This assumes      you've seen no sign of fire blight (a bacterial disease) in      the bark of the branches you've removed. Definitely don't      leave a pile of branches along the edge of your      yard-black rot can spread back to your fruit trees      from the decaying wood.    </p>        <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> A friend told me I should buy a      mycorrhizal product to boost the growth of my trees. Does      such a product have any worth?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Plants have developed an incredible      symbiotic relationship with certain fungi to help get      nutrients from the soil, as well as to ward off pathogenic      organisms. An apple tree has specific mycorrhizae that      interact with its roots in the humus layer in these ways.      You can inoculate your soil by finding a healthy wild tree      and then bringing a few scoops of the soil beneath its      branches back to your ground. Ecosystems adapt to the needs      at hand without our necessarily having to buy a packaged      product.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Why is thinning the fruitlets early      so important?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The cells that will become next year's      fruit buds are beginning to form when you can see this      year's fruitlets, which are baby apples just starting to      form. Properly thinning a tree within the first 30 days      after petal fall allows the tree to carry a good fruit crop      in the current year and still have enough nutrients to      develop next year's crop. Many wild apples tend towards      biennial bearing simply because this balance isn't achieved      without human intervention. Thinning by hand to leave a      single apple every 6 to 8 inches along the branch will      double the percentage of large fruit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PEST CONTROL</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What are these crusty scars on my      apples?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Apple scab. This fungal disease starts      on green tissue when buds start to unfurl. A spring rain      causes spores to be released by the tens of thousands from      overwintered scab lesions on leaf litter from the previous      season. That is why good sanitation begins with raking up      apple leaves in the fall to either compost or bury deep in      the woods. More-susceptible cultivars often need a few      weekly applications of sulfur during the primary infection      period, when fruit buds are just beginning to show pink      through the first rain following petal fall.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Do disease-resistant varieties      really make it easier to grow fruit?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Yes. Skipping those applications of      sulfur for apple scab and cedar apple rust can be a real      boon. Still, I grow the varieties I most like regardless of      disease resistance, knowing that the few disease control      efforts I employ can be combined with the sprays I'm using      to balance the insect pest dynamic.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> I've been using an all-purpose      spray on my trees for years, but I'd like to grow my fruit      organically. Where can I get an all-purpose organic      spray?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> That all-purpose spray from the garden      center was developed to sell along with the concept that      growers need not understand what's going on in the natural      world around them. It's an ecosystem tragedy when folks      apply pesticides and fungicides unnecessarily - the case      with any "fits all" strategy. A wise apple grower starts by      learning which pests and diseases are causes for local      concern, and then acts on each condition with targeted      understanding. The good news is that once you get attuned      to nature in this way, just a handful of well-timed actions      will bring you a reasonable harvest.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong></em> <em>What can I do about      caterpillars that strip the leaves</em> <em>off my      trees?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Smash the buggers! I've found that      tent caterpillars and army webworms come into orchards in      spotlike fashion. Keep an eye out for their web start-ups.      Then you can remove the larval colony by hand early on,      when the worms are small and haven't yet inflicted a great      amount of damage.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Some bug is tunneling into a lot of      my fruit</em> <em>when it's just the size of a nickel.      What's up?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> We deal with two "petal-fall pests" in      the eastern half of the United States that easily could be      your culprits. Plum curculio larvae get their start in a      crescentlike scar the female weevil makes to prevent the      growing fruitlet from crushing her egg; European apple      sawfly larvae first scratch the surface of a pea-sized      fruitlet, and then go on to eat the seeds in another three      or four fruitlets.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What's up with the new kaolin clay      spray?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Those petal-fall pests identified      above can be held effectively in check with a nontoxic      white clay covering applied over the entire surface of the      tree. The kaolin clay panicles confuse the insect adults      and prove incredibly irritating. Just imagine your own      eyes, ears and reproductive parts filled with micro-sized      dust; you'd opt to find a noncovered tree in which to feed      and lay eggs, too! "Surround" is the trade name of the      refined kaolin you need to apply this protective barrier.      Application begins as the blossoms start to fall and needs      to be thorough. It takes two or three initial sprays to      build up a thick enough base to repel these insects. Renew      the clay weekly for the next month.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Why did my grandparents hang open      jugs of vinegar and molasses out in the orchard?<br /></em>      <strong>MP:</strong> Such homegrown traps usually target      adult fruit moths such as the codling moth. Unfortunately,      all sons of bugs end up drowning in this brew, some of      which might have been beneficial allies. I prefer to      control codlings moths with well-timed sprays of      <em>Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt),</em> a biological      pesticide stomach-specific to caterpillars. Others have had      some success wrapping corrugated cardboard around the trunk      of the tree, where the larvae crawl to continue their      development. Then at the end of the summer, the cardboard      is removed and burned.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> When do I hang those red sticky      ball traps?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Apple maggot flies (AMF) are the      culprits drawn to these effective traps. The new generation      emerges from the soil beginning in late June, with females      seeking fruit in which to lay eggs throughout July and      August. The sticky balls mimic the best apple to be found      in the orchard. The female alights on the trap and stays      put because of a layer of sticky goo called "Tangletrap"      covering the red sphere. Some people report good luck using      red plastic cups for this same purpose. Two to four traps      per tree generally suffice to keep AMF larvae from ruining      a good harvest. I set out traps on early maturing varieties      by the first of July, then scrape off the dead flies and      renew the sticky material when moving the traps to      later-maturing varieties in early August.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What should I do with any fruit      that drops to the ground?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Quite a few insect pests pupate in the      soil beneath the tree. They get into fallen fruit, from      which the larvae crawl out and seek winter quarters.      Cleaning up drops each week cuts down on next year's pests.      We feed such drops to our sheep.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What's with this sooty blackness      that covers my fruit at harvest?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The so-called summer diseases show up      in late summer after enough wetting hours have occurred.      Both sooty blotch and flyspeck can be rubbed off the      surface of the fruit. A well-pruned tree is your best      defense-drying breezes help delay the onset of these      surface diseases.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> It seems everywhere that two apples      rub up against each other, the skin has been eaten away by      a worm. Is there anything I can do to prevent      this?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The larvae of many of the summer moths      will conceal themselves from the eyes of predators by going      between two apples in order to feed. A good job of thinning      earlier in the summer prevents this. Well-timed spray      applications of <em>Bt</em> can help keep burgeoning moth      populations in check.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> First, the blossoms on my Gala tree      turned brown. Then, the leaves yellowed and shoots curled      downward. By the next spring, the tree was completely dead.      What went wrong?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Quite a few of the newer (and often      sweeter) cultivars are susceptible to a bacterial disease      known as fire blight. Dwarfing rootstocks show similar      susceptibility. Infected branches must be pruned out early      and destroyed if the tree is to be saved.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      How does one rejuvenate an old tree?    </h3>    <p>      Going in with a pruning saw to undo a decade or more of      overgrowth in one shot can be disastrous to an old tree.      It's far better to approach this task over two or three      growing cycles.    </p>    <p>      The first year is the time to think big. All dead and      broken branches should be removed first to clarify what's      going on in that tumbled confusion of limbs. Seek out three      or four cuts either back at the trunk or on major scaffold      limbs.    </p>    <p>      Look for overly tall leaders, crossing branches and      narrow-angle crotches. Such heavy pruning usually results      in an abundance of water sprouts (vertical branches) that      could keep your tree in a non-fruiting mode for several      years to come. To prevent this, in early August, remove any      water sprouts that have appeared; this also stimulates the      tree to put more energy into its fruit buds.    </p>    <p>      The next winter, focus on excessive growth up high that      blocks sunlight to lower limbs.    </p>    <p>      During the third year and beyond is the lime for moderate      thinning cuts throughout the canopy; the days of large limb      removal should be behind you. Continue to prune water      sprouts throughout August to keep the tree's juices flowing      in a fruitful direction.    </p>    <p>      Fertilizing a tree during these years of invigorating      pruning cuts usually is not advised if terminal bud growth      is 8 inches or longer and the leaves are a dark-green hue.    </p>		</div>    <p>      <strong>GENERAL CARE</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What organic fertilizers can I use      on my apple trees?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Mature trees (those already bearing      fruit) generally don't need much nitrogen at all. Good      production depends more on adequate sources of potassium      and calcium. Rotting hay mulch provides the first, and      gypsum is a good source of calcium that won't affect pH. I      spread compost in late fall or early spring to build humus      and help in the decomposition of disease-carrying leaves.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> Why do some growers paint the      trunks of young trees white?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The dark trunk of a young fruit tree      warms up fast in the winter sunshine. Then, when the sun      goes down, the outer bark may freeze too quickly and split      on the side last facing the sun. A 50/50 mix of latex paint      and water applied in summer prevents this "southwest      injury."    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> How can I protect my trees from      deer?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The only permanent protection is a      tall fence. Most folks opt for less intrusive measures. A      repellent spray can be mixed from eggs, cayenne and fish      oil. This mixture needs to be applied monthly through the      winter if deer pressure is high. Deer love apple twigs, and      a hefty percentage of next season's fruit buds can be lost      overnight if you let your guard down.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> I've heard chickens take care of      orchard pests. Any truth to this?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> Scratching chickens can be counted on      to get some of those insects that fall to the ground to      pupate in the soil. Try spreading some corn meal to direct      their attention to the drip line of the tree. Use kaolin      clay spray to your advantage here: Spray all but your      "chicken tree," so that the curculios go to where the beaks      will snap them up.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What's the purpose of those plastic      spiral trunk guards?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> These protect the succulent bark of a      young tree from voles and rabbits. Spiral guards can be      wrapped around saplings in fall but then must be removed in      spring-the plastic holds in moisture and provides      cover for borers in the growing months. Wire mesh hardware      cloth can be used instead for year-round protection. Just      be sure to expand the mesh each season so it doesn't      constrict the trunk.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Apple Sources    </h3>    <p>      Michael Phillips' favorite mail-order nurseries are listed      below.

What can I do instead?</em><br />      <strong>M</strong> <strong>P:</strong> Hay mulch works      great to suppress grass growth, and as the mulch decays, it      provides potassium for the fruit trees. I've also planted      the herb comfrey under many of my freestanding trees as a      living mulch: The bumblebees love the blossoms, the leaves      of the comfrey smother the thick sod and the root      interaction favors apple trees.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> One of my 5-year-old trees broke      off right at the soil line. What caused this?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The round-headed apple tree borer lays      eggs in the bark right at the soil line. The grubs, in      turn, spend three years eating away at the cambium layer,      going down along major roots and back up again on the other      side of the trunk. Eventually, they bore their way right up      the center of the trunk to emerge as a new egg-laying adult      beetle in June, thus continuing the cycle of destruction.      The best protection is vigilance-poke a wire into      their entrance holes in September and spear the first-year      borers. A coating of thick, pottery-grade kaolin clay      applied to the trunks each summer seems to deter the female      beetle.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> What kind of sprayer do you      recommend for the backyard grower?</em><br />      <strong>MP:</strong> The value of a quality backpack      sprayer will show itself immediately. You won't have to set      the sprayer tank down to work the pump, and more spray can      be carried per tank-up to 5 gallons. Backpack sprayers come      with either a piston pump or a diaphragm pump. Both      compress air in a pressure chamber that allows irregular      pumping action to result in a steady stream. The piston      pump can generate a higher pressure than the diaphragm.      Greater pressure results in smaller-sized droplets of spray      and thus, more coverage. Abrasive materials like ground      botanicals and copper powders shorten the working life of a      piston but are easier on a diaphragm pump.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Q:</strong> How do I best store apples through      to spring?</em><br />      <strong>MP</strong> : Apples keep best if stored at or near      32 degrees with a relative humidity approaching 90 percent.      Our unheated farmhouse cellar works great: The drafty stone      foundation keeps things cool, and the dirt floor is damp.      Mesh wire cages protect six bushels of apples at a time      from nibbling mice. Garages, covered porches and woodsheds      do in a pinch for late fall storage; just cover the fruit      with old blankets on particularly crisp nights. When the      deep cold settles upon the land, you'll need to protect      your winter keepers from freezing. Sort through them one      last time. Put the best in perforated bags in the fridge,      and turn all the rest into that apple butter you never      quite got around to making over the holidays.    </p>    <p>      Michael Phillips is the author of <em>The Apple Grower</em>      , published by Chelsea Green Publishing and available on      MOTHERS Bookshelf, Page 127.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>

Head back a lanky leader on vigorous stock, but leave dwarf trees alone to encourage early bearing.
