                		<h5 id="byline">		By Louis Bromfield<br />    llustration by Wm. Keith Harrison</h5>        <p>      <em>Pulitzer prize-winning author Louis</em> <em>Bromfield      (1896-1956) wrote eloquently about the importance of rural      life and sustainable agriculture to our collective future.      This charming excerpt from his story, "My Ninety Acres," is      reprinted from</em> Return to Pleasant Valley <em>, a      collection of Bromfield's writings edited by MOTHER EARTH      NEWS contributing editor George DeVault.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-MOTHER</em>    </p>    <p>      In the first weeks after I came home I never thought about      my father's friend, old Walter Oakes. Indeed I had very      nearly forgotten his existence. And then one day I heard      Wayne, one of the boys on the farm, say something about My      Ninety Acres, and I remembered it all and asked, "is Walter      Oakes still alive?"    </p>    <p>      "Alive!" said Wayne, "I'll say he's alive. The liveliest      old man in the county. You ought to see that place.      Brother, that's the kind of farm I'd like to own. He raises      as much on it as most fellows raise on five times that much      land."    </p>    <p>      Wayne, of course, was only 20. He couldn't know how once      people had laughed when Walter Oakes spoke proudly of My      Ninety Acres. Clearly they didn't laugh any more. Clearly      Walter Oakes was the best farmer in all the county, very      likely the best farmer in all the rich Ohio country.    </p>    <p>      The next Sunday I walked over the hills to My Ninety Acres.      As I came down the long hill above the farm I saw it hadn't      changed much. The house still looked well painted and neat      with its white walls and green shutters, and the barn was a      bright, new, prosperous red.    </p>    <p>      As I walked down the hill I thought, "This is the most      beautiful farm in America-the most beautiful, rich      farm in the world-My Ninety Acres."    </p>    <p>      The corn stood waist high and vigorous and green, the oats      thick and strong, the wheat already turning a golden      yellow. In the meadow the bumblebees were working on clover      that rose almost as high as a man's thighs.    </p>    <p>      I pushed open the little gate and walked into the dooryard      with the neatly mown grass bordered by lilacs and peonies      and day lilies ... I remembered enough to know I should      find old Walter somewhere in the fields. Sunday afternoon      he always spent walking over the place. As a small boy I      had followed him and my father many times.    </p>    <p>      So I went down toward the creek, and as I turned the corner      by the barnyard I saw him down below, moving along a      fencerow. Two sheep dogs were with him, the      great-great-great-grandchildren of the pair I had known as      a boy. They were running in and out of the hedgerow yapping      joyously. I stood a moment, watching the scene.    </p>    <p>      It was Nellie that had that idea about lettin' fencerows      grow up. I always found out Nellie was pretty right about      farmin'. She was hardly ever wrong... I guess never.    </p>    <p>      The fencerow bordered a meadow of deep, thick hay, and      below, among feathery willows, wound the clear spring      stream where I had often gone swimming with Walter's boys:      John, who had been everything Walter had hoped for in a      son, the best loved, who was buried somewhere in the      Argonne; and Robert, who had gone away to become rich and      powerful. There was something lonely about the figure of      the old man wandering along the fencerow filled with      sassafras and elderberry. For no reason I could understand      I felt a lump come to my throat.    </p>    <p>      Then I noticed the old man's-erratic progress. He would      walk a little way and then stop and, parting the bushes,      peer into the tangled fencerow. Once he got down on his      knees and for a long time disappeared completely in the      thick clover.    </p>    <p>      Finally, as he started back along the far side of the      fields, I set off down the slope toward him. He seemed to      realize I must have seen him for a long time, ducking and      dodging in and out of the fencerow. A faint tinge of color      came into his face and he said, shyly, "I was just snoopin'      around my 90 acres, I like to see what goes on here and I      don't get time during the week."    </p>    <p>      He looked down at his big hands and noticed, as I did, that      some of the black, damp loam of the fencerow still clung to      them. He brushed them awkwardly together. "I was just      digging into the fencerow to see what was going on there      underground. A fellow can learn a lot by watching his own      land and what goes on in it and on it. My son John - you      remember the one that was killed in the war - he went to      agricultural school, but I don't think he learned more      there than I've learned just out of studying my own 90      acres. Nellie always said a farm could teach you more than      you could teach it, if you just kept your eyes open ...      Nellie ... that was my wife."    </p>    <p>      "Of course," I said. "I remember."    </p>    <p>      Then he said, "Come with me and I'll show you something."    </p>    <p>      I followed him along the fencerow, and presently he knelt      and parted the bushes and beckoned to me. I knelt beside      him and he pointed. "Look!" he said, and his voice grew      suddenly warm. "Look at the little devils."    </p>    <p>      I looked and could see nothing at all but dried, brown      leaves with a few delicate fern fronds thrusting through      them. Old Walter chuckled and said, "Can't see 'em, can      you? Look, over there, just by that hole in the stump." I      looked, and then slowly I saw what he was pointing at. They      sat in a little circle in a tiny nest, none of them much      bigger than the end of one of old Walter's big      thumbs-seven tiny quail. They sat very still not      moving a feather, lost among the dry, brown leaves. I might      not have seen them at all but for the brightness of their      little eyes.    </p>    <p>      "Smart!" he said, with the same note of tenderness in his      voice. "They know! They don't move!"    </p>    <p>      Then a cry of "Bob White!' came from the thick, fragrant      clover behind us and Walter said, "The old man's somewhere      around." The whistle was repeated, again and then again.      Old Walter stood up and said, "They used to laugh at me for      letting the bushes grow up in my fencerows, but they don't      any more. When the chinch bugs come along all ready to eat      up my corn, these little fellows will take care of 'em." He      chuckles, "There's nothing a quail likes as much as a      chinch bug.    </p>    <p>      "Last year Henry Talbot, down the road, lost 10 acres of      corn all taken by the bugs. Henry's a nut for clear      fencerows. He doesn't leave enough cover along 'em for a      grasshopper. He thinks that's good farming, the old fool!"      And the old man chuckled again.    </p>    <p>      We were walking now up the slope from the creek toward the      house, and he went on talking, "That fencerow beside you,"      he said, "is just full of birds-quail and song      sparrows and thrushes-the farmer's best protection.      It was Nellie that had that idea about lettin' fencerows      grow up. I didn't believe her at first. I was just as dumb      as most other farmers. But I always found out Nellie was      pretty right about farmin'. She was hardly ever wrong ... I      guess never."    </p>    <p>      It wasn't the last time I saw old Walter. There was enough      of my father in me to make the friendship between myself      and the old man before long very nearly as warm as their      friendship had been. And after all, between them, they had      taught me many of the things I had come with experience to      value most in life. The Sunday afternoon visits to My      Ninety Acres became nearly a habit, for I found gradually      that old Walter was in himself an education. He knew more      of the fundamentals of soil, of crops, of livestock than      any man I have ever known. Some of them he had read in      books and in farm papers but he didn't trust the things he      read until he tried them out, and many of them he didn't      even attempt to try since out of his own wisdom he      understood at once they were rubbish. Instinctively and out      of experience he rejected things that ran counter to the      laws of nature.    </p>    <p>      "Nellie," he would say, "always said that Nature and the      land itself was the best answer to all these questions. 'If      it wasn't natural it wasn't right,' Nellie would say, and      I've never found that she was wrong. She used to say that      there were two kinds of farms-the 'live' farms and      the 'dead' ones-and you could tell the difference by      looking at them. A 'live' farm was the most beautiful place      in the world and a 'dead' farm was the saddest. It depended      on the man who worked them, whether he loved the place and      saw what was going on or whether he just went on pushing      implements through the ground to make money. Nellie was      awful smart about a lot of things."    </p>    <p>      Copies of <em>Return to Pleasant Valley</em> , published by      the American Botanist, are Stock No. 1893 on MOTHER'S      Bookshelf; to order, call (866) 833-7096.
