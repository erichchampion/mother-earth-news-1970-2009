            				<p>      We cut our own lumber and built our off-the-grid home for      only $5,000.  </p>		<h5 id="byline">	      Story and photos by Les Oke    </h5>        <p>      During the days of skyrocketing interest rates in the late      1980s, my wife, Jane, and I realized that our dream of      owning a home was slipping away. For the first eight years      of our marriage, we lived in a rented house in Norwich,      Ontario, and we just couldn't save fast enough to buy our      own place.    </p>    <p>      Then, a friend gave us a box of 80 back issues of MOTHER      EARTH NEWS. That box opened up a whole new world for us.      Reading those magazines, we realized other people looked at      the world the same way we did.    </p>    <p>      In 1992, we purchased 20 acres of bush in Northbrook, a      hamlet in eastern Ontario about 150 miles from Norwich. The      property had a plowed back road with school bus service,      but it didn't have electric power. We were determined to      live without the "monthly mortgage," as my wife calls it,      to the electric company.    </p>    <p>      The same friend introduced me to <em>Living the Good      Life,</em> the classic homesteading book by Helen and Scott      Nearing, and I discovered self-sufficiency. I began      corresponding with Helen (Scott had died five years      earlier) about our move and our worries. In her motherly      way, she patiently guided us through our fears. I still      have those letters.    </p>    		<p>      On May 5, 1994, we moved to our property, determined to      build our house before the first snow. We had saved $5,000      for this purpose.    </p>    <p>      We lived in a tent trailer that I had bartered for when      working with a local carpenter. By June, we had the land      cleared and the concrete footings and block walls done. A      local contractor put in the septic system and well, and      cleared the land for $700.    </p>    <p>      Early June saw us agonizing over the high price of lumber.      The next week I was at our chain saw dealer to pick up oil      and a new chain when I casually mentioned the price of      lumber. He asked, "Have you seen these mill attachments      that fit on your chain saw? You make your own lumber if      you've got trees." Excited, I told him, "I've got 20 acres      of trees. Keep talking!"    </p>        <p>      He explained how it worked and I ordered one (see photo      above). When it arrived the next week, I set it up and went      to work. The mill attachment cost C$250, but it literally      paid for itself the first day.    </p>    <p>      Throughout June and July I cut lumber. I'm proud to say      that not one piece of store-bought lumber makes up our      house frame. We cut studs, 6-by-6-foot floor joists,      10-by-10-foot beams, 19-foot-long roof trusses and      12-inch-wide roof boards, all with the chain saw mill.      Granted it was smelly, hot and dirty work. But the chain      saw mill proved indispensable to this "cheap Scotsman," as      my wife calls me.    </p>    <p>      We only cut mature trees, and we used dead and damaged      trees whenever possible. Because we cut the lumber right      where the trees fell, all the waste was left to break down      and fertilize the forest. In a healthy forest, there is no      need to replant; simply let natural regeneration take      place.    </p>    <p>      Building the house turned out to be a slow process. Soon      October was closing in on us and we only had the second      floor done. A roof was two months' work away. What should      we do?    </p>    <p>      <em>Harborside, Maine<br /></em> <em>August 18, 1993</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear Friend</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You write and ask how one finds people of similar aims      and congeniality. Sometimes one never does. After decades      of expressing our opinions on our likes and dislikes there      are very few people who agree with us entirely.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>With the vegetarians, and hygienists and theosophists      we are too radical politically. With our political friends      we are too queer with our vegetarian and" "spiritual"      ideas. With conservative people we meet socially we're too      far to the left in everything. So we go our way alone and      maintain our own standards, let the clips fall where they      may. You may have to learn to stand alone.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Very best wishes,<br />      Helen Nearing</em>    </p>    <p>      Words of encouragement from the late legendary homesteader      Helen Nearing    </p>    <p>      After working for nearly five months without a day off, we      took a trip to my parents' home in southern Ontario. While      we were there, my dad mentioned a large greenhouse grower      who suffered hail damage to half his plastic greenhouses.      His insurance was replacing all his greenhouses and he had      lots of 200-by-400-foot rolls of used plastic to give away.    </p>    <p>      I loaded two rather unwieldy rolls of plastic into our      full-sized van. The children sat on the plastic for the      five-hour trip home. The next day we installed two layers      of plastic over the second floor to make a makeshift roof,      crossed our fingers and moved in. It was Sept 25, 1994.    </p>    <p>      Finally, we were warm and happy and we lived in the house      like that for three years. During those years we started a      market garden business and began selling organic produce      just like we had before we moved. That provided most of our      income, along with part-time jobs. We built a 60-foot      greenhouse with cedar (cut with the chain saw mill) and the      left-over plastic.    </p>    <p>      We spent the off-season cutting roof trusses and boards.      March 1997 was unseasonably warm and sunny, so we decided      to put the roof on. We worked 22 days straight, and at      10:30 Sunday morning of the next day we pounded down the      last shingle nail. Then it started to rain.    </p>    <p>      Jane and I stood on the hill overlooking the house, holding      hands and rejoicing as water dripped off the eaves. We were      done. Our completed house is 1,400 square feet with eight      rooms. It cost only $5,000 but took four years to build.    </p>    <p>      The children sometimes complain about the kerosene lamps,      or no electricity and video games like their friends, but      we know they're happy. We recently hooked up solar panels      to run a computer and lights. Nearly nine years without a      utility bill. Hallelujah!    </p>    <p>      During slow times, we work on other projects. In 1998, we      built a root cellar from field stone, a wonderful building      material. It's free for the taking and looks tremendous      when the project is done. It's also a great challenge to      master a new art. Believe me, it is an art putting      irregular stones together and imagining what they will look      like when you're finished. After the root cellar, we      tackled our fireplace. It looks beautiful and is the focal      point of our first floor. Everyone remarks on how well the      fireplace fits in with our timber design.    </p>        <p>      When we're asked why we live the way we do, one event      always springs to mind: the ice storm of 1998. Two full      days of freezing rain put most of eastern Ontario, southern      Quebec and the northeast United States in the dark from      downed power lines. It virtually paralyzed the area for      weeks. In contrast, our children were ready at the school      bus stop the day after the storm ended, but the school was      closed for two weeks. We were relatively unaffected.    </p>    <p>      The hubbub that followed the storm included a gigantic      cleanup effort in the affected areas. Our 90-year-old      neighbor flatly refused to be removed from her home and      placed in an emergency shelter, unequivocally telling her      would-be rescuers, "I've lived more years than I care to      remember with just my woodstove, my hand pump and a bucket.      it's you people who have the problem." She promptly went      back into her house, closed the door and proceeded to fire      the woodstove to make her supper.    </p>    <p>      Our neighbor really makes us laugh - our lifestyle is      similar to how she grew up more than 80 years ago. She      smiles when she talks to us because we can relate to each      other. Most people today just don't get it.    </p>    <p>      I know that anyone with a modest amount of energy and      perseverance could do what we've done. I owe a great deal      to the people who have gone before me and shed light on our      own journey to self-sufficiency. Special thanks go to Helen      and Scott Nearing. I hope they're smiling at our      accomplishments, wherever they may be. And thanks to MOTHER      EARTH NEWS most of all. There was a time when I read      readers' reports to learn. Now I hope that I can help      someone else in return.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
