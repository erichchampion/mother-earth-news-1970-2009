                        <p>      Snip fine-flavored, crispy green chive leaves over a salad      or a baked potato, or into a bowl of piping hot soup for a      colorful garnish that punches up the taste a delicious      notch, or maybe two.</p>    <p>      The most deli cately flavored member of the onion family,      chives have been hardy gar den plants and tasty kitchen      staples for more than 5,000 years. Regular (or "fine")      chives <em>(Allium</em> <em>schoenoprasum),</em> are native      to northern Europe, Asia and North America. The leaves are      shaped like tiny tubes that taper to a point. They grow in      clumps and emerge in early spring from winter dormancy,      followed quickly by the lilac-to-rosy pink, clover-like      blooms on 12- to 24-inch long stems.    </p>    <p>      Both leaves and flowers are edible; the fresh blooms may be      served whole or separated into petals; they can be added to      vinegar, to which they impart a lovely pink hue; and they      make nice cut flowers, too. When in full bloom, a mature      clump is so pretty that you may be reluctant to gather the      flowers, yet removing them often prolongs the bloom time      while encouraging the plant to expend more energy producing      new leaves.    </p>    <p>      Garlic chives ( <em>A. tuberosum</em> <em>)</em> are the      other common garden chives and are similar in height to      regular chives. Also known as Chinese chives or <em>gow      choy</em> <em>,</em> garlic chives are native to eastern      Asia and are as hardy and easy to grow as regular chives.      The plants have flat, strap-like leaves with a distinct      hint of garlic rather than onion, and the delicate, white      blooms grow in clusters that appear in late summer after      many other flowers have come and gone.    </p>    <p>      Both leaves and blooms of garlic chives are edible, too,      but do not be misled by the <em>tuberosum</em> species      name; the roots are knobby but hardly bulbous, and not at      all tasty. In this part of the world, garlic chive blossoms      are not nearly as popular for eating as those of regular      chives. But garlic chives are so pretty and long-lasting      that they're often grown as garden ornamentals or for cut      flowers rather than as a culinary ingredient. Many      beneficial insects also feed on nectar found in the      flowers. Garlic chives bloom all at once and seldom      complain, even if you gather almost every stem to enjoy      indoors.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sun-loving, extremely cold-hardy (Zone 3)      perennials, chives ask only for regular water and      reasonably fertile soil to be contented garden      residents.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>GROW YOUR OWN</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the garden, let chives help bring out your painterly      side. They're pretty enough to include among your flowers,      and they may be good companion plants in both the flower      and vegetable gardens, too. According to a 1999 report in      the <em>Journal of Chemical Ecology,</em> interplanting      garlic chives with tomatoes helps suppress bacterial wilt,      a real challenge for tomato growers in the Southeast.    </p>    <p>      Sun-loving, extremely cold-hardy (Zone 3) perennials,      chives ask only for regular water and reasonably fertile      soil to be contented garden residents. Early spring is the      best season to start a new planting of either regular or      garlic chives. Both are easy to grow from seed, but be sure      it's fresh because germination rates can fall below 50      percent after only one year. Also, be aware that seedlings      are apt to remain small through their first year, so if you      want good-sized clumps in short order, purchase the plants      or trade with a friend for some pass-alongs; chives      multiply by bunching as well as by seed, so digging and      dividing established clumps every few years is good for the      plants, too.    </p>    <p>      The grassy texture of chive leaves also makes them a      welcome addition to container plantings of herbs, where      they do exceedingly well. If you live far enough south to      leave a planted container outdoors all winter, try this:      Bring one inside in late winter, while the weather is still      cold and the plants are dormant. Within a few days, a tuft      of green chive shoots will spurt up, their growth triggered      by the warmer temperatures. Chives forced to grow early      indoors often do not bloom as enthusiastically after they      go back outside as those allowed to follow their natural      rhythms, but you need not worry about killing them. Whether      forced indoors or grown outside, clumps will continue to      produce nonstop all summer and into fall. As the growing      season progresses, a mulch of nitrogen-rich grass clippings      will help the plants continue to flourish, especially those      in containers.    </p>    <p>      In very hot weather, the leaves of regular chives may      wither, but after a short rest, heat-stressed plants that      are given regular water usually rebound and produce a new      crop of tender young leaves in the fall. Garlic chives hold      their strappy green leaves well through summer's heat,      though the leaves often become tough and fibrous. The      best-quality garlic chive leaves are gathered in late      spring; by the time they bloom in late summer, these plants      are best appreciated as a lovely perennial. Both species      die back to the ground when freezing weather comes but need      no special protection to insure their winter survival.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Mashed Potatoes and Parsnips with Chives    </h3>    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/202-122-01.jpg" alt="202-122-01.jpg" width="200" height="131" />    </div>    <p>      Here's a tasty and healthful side dish that combines an old      winter favorite, parsnips, with potatoes and chives. Any      leftovers can be used as a flavorful thickening for a      hearty winter soup.<br />      <br />      <em>2 cups potatoes, cubed and peeled (about 3 medium      potatoes)<br /></em> <em>1 cup parsnips, cubed and peeled      (about 2 medium parsnips)<br />      1 large clove garlic, quartered cup low fat milk<br />      1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced<br />      2 tablespoons fresh chives, finely chopped teaspoon salt      teaspoon pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Place potatoes, parsnips and garlic in a large saucepan and      add water to barely cover. Bring to a boil, then lower heat      to medium and cook until tender, about 14 minutes. Drain      off water. Add remaining ingredients and mash with a fork,      potato masher, or mixer to desired consistency. Serves 4.    </p>		</div>    <p>      <strong>C</strong><strong>OOKING WITH CHIVES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Snip chives into little pieces using scissors or mince them      on a cutting board with a sharp knife. Many people enjoy      loading up baked potatoes with fixin's that include mounds      of chive greens. The combination makes a delicious culinary      partnership, but it marks only the beginning of this herb's      tasty uses. The mild flavor of chives makes them acceptable      to most palates, even raw-a claim that cannot be made      for other onions. Both regular and garlic chives are rich      in vitamins A and C, calcium and phosphorous and, as      members of the Allium family, they may help prevent such      diseases as cancer, and lower blood pressure and control      bleeding, too.    </p>    <p>      You can add chives to such naturally mild-flavored cooked      dishes as omelets and cream sauces with good effect. For a      beautiful presentation of long, cylindrical vegetables such      as asparagus, carrots or green beans, tie the vegetables      into small bundles using chive leaves as strings. Then,      steam the tied bundles until the vegetables are tender. For      a tasty herbed spread, mix 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh      chives into half a cup of softened butter, reduced-fat      cream cheese or a mixture of both.    </p>    <p>      To make a delicately flavored and colored vinegar with      regular chive blossoms, begin with 2 cups of mild, white      vinegar such as white rice vinegar, and add 2 cups (packed)      fresh blossoms. Let stand at least a week; then strain,      discarding the faded blooms, and transfer the flavored      vinegar to storage bottles. Add a few fresh blossoms on      their stems for a decorative look.    </p>    <p>      To preserve your garden chives for winter cooking, chop and      freeze the leaves in ice cube trays. Home-dried chives      usually lack flavor; the commercial, freeze-dried product      is better tasting.    </p>    <p>      Adapted from Barbara Pleasant's forthcoming book, <em>The      Whole</em> <em>Herb</em> <em>, to</em> be published by      Square One Publishers.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
