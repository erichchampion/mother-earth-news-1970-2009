                    <h3>      Enjoy the experience of heart-healthy eating with these      delicious mediterranean dishes.			</h3>    <h5 id="byline">	      By Elaine Gavalas    </h5>        <p>      Greeks love to celebrate life with an abundance of food,      dance, music and song, and will seize any occasion to host      a feast. Fortunately, all this partying may be good for us.      Modern research champions traditional Greek cuisine as the      heart-healthiest food in the world. Landmark studies      indicate the rural people of Crete and Greece have some of      the world's lowest rates of diet-linked disease and      obesity, and are among ethnic groups with the longest life      expectancies.    </p>    <p>      I grew up in a household where my grandfather and father      were Greek Orthodox priests, and it seemed as if every      weekend was an occasion for a <em>glendi</em> (party). I      was constantly attending a birthday, wedding, bridal      shower, baptism or celebration for someone's name day      (their Saint's feast day). Then there were our yearly      celebrations, including the Greek parade, the annual      <em>glendi</em> of our <em>patriotis</em> (fellow      countrymen) from Arcadia and Laconia (my family's home      regions in Greece), and such religious holidays as      Christmas and Easter. With all our aunts, uncles, cousins,      nieces, nephews, <em>koumbados</em> (godparents),      <em>sembetheros</em> (relatives by marriage) and      <em>patriotis,</em> my family barely had time to digest      before the next gathering was upon us!    </p>    <p>      <strong>GREEK INGREDIENTS</strong>    </p>        <p>      As proudly explained by Gus, father of the bride in the hit      movie <em>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</em> <em>,</em> Greece      has given the world many gifts, from architecture to      philosophy. Certainly one of Greece's most valuable      contributions is its cuisine.    </p>    <p>      At the core of the traditional Greek diet are dark-green      leafy vegetables (often wild-gathered), including      dandelions, spinach, mustard, fennel, cumin and purslane;      fresh fruits such as figs, pears, plums, grapes, melons and      oranges; high-fiber whole grains, beans and lentils;      complex carbohydrate-rich pastas and breads; olive oil;      nuts; and such herbs and spices as garlic, oregano, bay      leaves, cinnamon and cloves.    </p>    <p>      Rich in immune-boosting antioxidants, the Greek diet      provides cancer-fighting compounds, healthful omega-3 fatty      acids and colon-cleansing fiber, which all help lower the      risks of diet linked diseases, including heart disease,      obesity and diabetes. A 2003 study conducted jointly by      researchers at the University of Athens in Greece and      Harvard University found that people who consumed a      traditional Greek diet experienced a 33 percent lower risk      of death from heart disease and a 24 percent lower risk of      death from cancer.    </p>    <p>      Many Greek dishes contain cheeses, such as feta made from      goat's or sheep's milk. These cheeses are lower in fat and      easier to digest than those from cow's milk. Greeks enjoy      thick, creamy goat-milk yogurt with fresh fruit and a      drizzle of honey.    </p>    <p>      Greek cuisine is noted for its lamb dishes, but lamb is      traditionally only eaten on special occasions. More often,      Greek meals include fish (anchovies, cod, flounder and      tuna, for example) in moderate portions throughout the      week. As shown in several studies, the omega-3 fatty acids      in fish oils help prevent heart attacks and high blood      pressure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OLIVE OIL POWER</strong>    </p>    <p>      The ancient Greeks regarded olive oil as a gift from the      gods-olive trees were valued as much as gold. Modern      nutrition also places high value on olive oil, finding that      it offers numerous health benefits. The traditional rural      Greek diet features olive oil as the principal fat, rather      than butter and margarine. Olive oil is high in      monounsaturated fat, and a 1989 study revealed that it      raises levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol while lowering      artery-clogging LDL ("bad") cholesterol.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Numerous studies, including one published by the      American Heart Association, have shown that people</strong>      <strong>who eat a high monounsaturated fat diet, such as      the traditional Greek diet, have a lower risk of heart      disease than people who eat more saturated fats, which      include butter and margarine.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Researchers also found that people who consume olive oil      have a lower risk for other diseases, too. Studies      conducted by Dr. Dimitrios Trichopoulos at the Harvard      School of Public Health indicate a link between olive oil      consumption and a lower incidence of breast cancer and      osteoporosis.    </p>    <p>      And a 1999 study conducted by Dr. Athena Linos and      colleagues at the University of Athens Medical School      showed that the Mediterranean diet may even help protect      against rheumatoid arthritis. People who consumed olive oil      and lots of cooked vegetables had a 39 percent lower risk      of developing this joint disease.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Mediterranean Diet Pyramid</strong>    </p>    <p>      Greek food may taste delicious, but the secret behind the      healthy Mediterranean diet lies not in consuming more      Kalamata olives and fish, but in adopting the entire Greek      style of eating.    </p>    <p>      For guidance, you can turn to the Mediterranean food      pyramid, created by experts at the Harvard School of Public      Health, and the Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust (a      nonprofit food issues think tank). These guidelines are      based on the dietary habits of rural Greeks before 1960,      when heart disease rates in Greece were 90 percent lower      than those in the United States.    </p>    <p>      The base of the pyramid is daily exercise, followed by the      traditional Greek foods we should all eat more of, notably      whole (rather than processed) grains, and generous servings      of fruits and vegetables, nuts and beans. Olive oil, cheese      and yogurt also make the list of daily foods, but need to      be eaten in exchange for-not in addition      to-other, less healthy fats.    </p>    <p>      Although meat is an important part of the pyramid, it isn't      eaten on a daily basis, and red meat is recommended only a      few times a month and in small portions. Unlike the U.S.      Department of Agriculture's Food Guide Pyramid, the      Mediterranean pyramid recognizes the health benefits of red      wine and suggests drinking a glass a day.    </p>        <p>      <strong>GREEK SPIRIT</strong>    </p>    <p>      According to Greek mythology, it was the god Dionysus, son      of Zeus, who gave humankind the vine and taught the Greeks      how to cultivate and ferment the sacred wine. The Greek      saying, "The gods are only a memory, but one can taste the      gods in the wine," corresponds with the ageless Greek      tradition of enjoying a glass of wine at almost every meal.    </p>        <p>      Research conducted by Dr. D.K. Das and colleagues at the      University of Connecticut School of Medicine suggests that      red wine contains flavonoid antioxidants and resveratrol,      an organic compound from grape skins that may lower the      risk of blood clots and heart attacks. In 2002, researchers      in France found that drinking red wine in moderation may      even increase HDL cholesterol levels.    </p>    <p>      The Mediterranean food pyramid recommends drinking about a      glass of wine a day to promote good health. (For some      people, though, drinking wine is not advisable. For      example, women who are pregnant or people who take      medications that might interact with alcohol should not      imbibe.)    </p>    <p>      Greek food is a wise choice, whether you're at risk for      high cholesterol, suffering from high blood pressure,      trying to stave off obesity or just looking for      mouth-watering dishes to satisfy your appetite.
