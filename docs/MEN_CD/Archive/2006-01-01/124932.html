        Lawn mowers, tillers and other power equipment all need oil changesas a part of their routine maintenance. This task usually involvesremoving drain plugs, which can lead to messy spills, and many ofus tend to skip the task just to avoid the hassle. But, failure tochange the oil will reduce the life of your engine.<br /><br />Now there's a product that makes it easy to change your oil. NorthCarolina-based Pela Products has released an oil extractor designedspecifically for small jobs.<br /><br />It's affordable ($29.99), and we found it quick and easy to use ?drop the long tube down the engine's dipstick pipe, pump five to 10times in a row to create a vacuum and watch the oil drain into thecontainer. The PELA 2000 oil change pump has a capacity of 2.5liters (1 liter equals about 1 quart). In addition to garden andyard equipment, it is especially handy for draining boat engines.Be sure to properly dispose of used oil, which should never bepoured directly onto soil or down sewer drains. (Visit<a href="http://www.earth911.org" target="_blank">Earth 911</a> to find a localoil-recycling center.)<br /><br />The oil extractor comes in two other sizes: a 6-liter version($43.99) and a 6.5-liter size ($69.99).
