Tarn (reviewed back in issue 86) for $575 (west coast). Equipped with all the latest componentry (Deore SIS shifters and rear derailleurs, for starters), the Hoo-Koo-E-Koo is made in Taiwan according to Fisher design and specifications. That adds up to an expensive bicycle bargain. To get more information, write to Fisher Mountainbikes, 1421 E. Francisco Blvd., San Rafael, CA 94901,415/459-2247.</p><p><strong>This buck gives you the goods for the woods.</strong></p><h3>Backwoods High-Tech</h3><p>Buck Knives' new titanium lock-back knife epitomizes the current trend in outdoor equipment. Made of the stuff that saves pounds on F-16 fighters, the skeleton-framed model 18600 is no doubt grams lighter for its exotic-metal handle. Assembled with allen screws and equipped with the appropriate wrench, it can be quickly field-stripped for cleaning. The 3Â½" blade is Buck's usual fine high-carbon, high-chrome tempered steel. The titanium is corrosion resistant, and a belt clip is supplied, so you won't even need a sheath. Check with your Buck Knives dealer.</p>
