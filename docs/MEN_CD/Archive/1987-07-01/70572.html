           		<p>MOTHER'S HANDBOOK</p>        <p><em>      Very beginner-level building skills.</em>     </p>		 <h5 id="byline"><em>By Pat Stone</em></h5>        <p>      <strong>Carpentry is really more of a mental game than a      physical one: The pencil is more important than the      saw.</strong>    </p>    <p>      A couple of summers ago, I took a leave from my desk job to      work with the three-man carpentry crew that was building my      family's new house. I didn't know much of anything about      carpentry, but I wanted to learn and was eager to      participate.    </p>    <p>      One day during the initial framing, I <em>was</em> talking      with the utility company worker who was hooking up our      temporary power line. "How many people you got working on      your house?" he asked me. "Three," I said, referring to the      paid crew and shyly omitting myself. "That's good," he      said. "Three's the perfect number. If you have any more      than that, one of them's usually a lunt who does more harm      than good."    </p>    <p>      That was me, all right-I was pretty incompetent. But      I learned. And, as a result, I may not be a professional      carpenter, but I am past the initial mismeasure and misnail      stage. So (with the help of two contractor friends, Bill      McCurdy and Chris Crosson), I'd like to share some building      lore for other people who don't know a speed square from a      chalk line (and might feel a bit embarrassed about that      lack of knowledge). Anybody already competent with such      tools can stop reading now-you won't learn anything      new here. This article contains those basic tips that      <em>real</em> carpenters don't often deign to tell      beginning ones.<br />      It's just for us lunts.    </p>   <h3> Measuring</h3>    <p>      The real secret to carpentry, one friend told me, is to      <em>not</em> misplace your tools. That may sound so obvious      it's stupid, but it's not half as stupid as you'll feel the      first day you spend more time hunting tools than using      them. So, right off the bat, buy yourself a tool belt.      Stash your gear in those leather pouches, and you won't      have to retrace all your steps every time you need the tape      measure.    </p>    <p>      (By the way, you know what a carpenter's most important      tool is? I was shocked to realize this: a <em>pencil</em> .      Carpentry involves constant figuring and measuring. So if      you ain't got a pencil, you cain't build.)    </p>    <p>      Let's talk about that tape measure. A locking, retractable      tape-that's the thing you need, ¾ or 1" wide,      so it's stiff enough for long, one-person measurements, and      16' to 25' long. Notice how the metal tab on the end of      that thing's kinda loose? It's not busted (my first      suspicion). Rather, that tab (Fig. 1) pushes in when you      measure from the inside of a board and pulls out when you      measure from the outside-so it self-corrects for its      own width. Never give that looseness another thought; just      measure away, you'll be OK. (Do use the same tape for the      whole job, though, in case one tape's tab moves more than      another's.)    </p>    		    <p>      <strong>"Level twice, build once." Constantly      checking-and rechecking-is a key to good      building.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Measure twice, cut once:</em> Even professional      carpenters try to follow that axiom to avoid sawing boards      the wrong length. That makes repeating a measurement before      you cut mandatory for us beginners (I've measured three      times when I was nervous). Take care to read the tape      accurately, noting the right number of inches and fractions      thereof. When you read a tape upside down, don't mistake      26" for 29"-and don't accidentally think you're      reading 7' 10" when you're really reading 6' 10". (These      are really very easy mistakes to make, because we normally      read left to right, but you have to read an upside-down      tape <em>right</em> to <em>left</em> .)    </p>    <p>      How do you measure higher than you can reach? Let a lot of      tape out so you can run it past the end point you're      measuring. It'll curve back toward your hand, but as long      as the tape's straight to the end point, your measurement      will be straight, as well (Fig. 2). Use the same      tape-bending trick when you're measuring against an inside      wall and can't run the measure past your end point. (Or if      the tape measure case is an exact width, like 2" or 3", you      can just run it into the wall and add its width-don't      forget to do this-to the tape length you see.)    </p>   <h3> Marking</h3>    <p>      OK, you've measured (twice). You're sure you need to cut a      board 68¾ long. Now grab that board, hook your tape      over one end, run it down 683/4", and mark the cutting      point with a big V whose two legs diverge from the exact      point. That V, or "crow's-foot," is a more accurate way to      mark an exact spot than a penciled line. You might get      thrown off by the width of a line or the fact that it may      not be perpendicular to the board, but a V points to      precisely the right spot. It also makes a big mark that is      easy to spot (that's important).    </p>    <p>      Now you need to mark a right angle from that crow's-foot so      the whole board will be 68¾ long. You can use a      <em>combination square</em> or a big <em>framing      square</em> for that, but for my money the best tool for      the job is a <em>speed square</em> (a right triangle with      protruding rims on one of its sides). You can lay its      rimmed side against your board, line up the right-angled      side with your V mark and-zip-run your pencil      down that edge for a perfectly straight,      square-to-the-board line (Fig. 3).    </p>    <p>      You know what? I just left something out. You should first      use your right-angled tool to check the end of the board      that you won't be cutting. I know, you bought your wood      from the lumberyard, so it's supposed to have square ends.      Check it anyway-sometimes it won't. Once you've made      sure that end's square (cut it square if you have to),      measure those 68¾ " and mark your cut.    </p>       <h3>Driving a nail home in two or three hits comes with      practice-lots of practice</h3>    <p>      And anytime you goof and mark a line in the wrong place, be      <em>sure</em> to run a squiggly pencil line all the way      through the bad line when you draw the correct one.      Otherwise, you'll have two lines to choose from when you      cut, and-inevitably-you'll sometimes pick the      wrong one.    </p>    									    <p>      Now suppose you're ripping (cutting with the grain instead      of across it) down the length of a long board, or cutting      across a full-sized sheet of plywood. Sure, you can mark      the V on both ends of the board, so you'll know where to      start and end your cut, but your square won't reach all the      way across, so how can you mark a straight cutting line      between those points? Well, it's time to pull another handy      aid out of your well-supplied tool belt: the <em>chalk      line</em> . This is a string that's covered with colored      marking chalk. Pull the end out of its case, hook its tab      over the near V on your board, run out some string (keeping      it off the board), line it up on the far V and pull it      taut. Then lift the string ( <em>straight</em> up) in the      middle (keep it taut now) and let go (Fig. 4). It'll snap      down against the board. Lift the string off, winding as you      go, and the chalk it shed when snapped will leave a nice      straight line that marks the entire length of your cut.    </p>    <p>      A few chalk line pointers: Get a <em>blue</em> one; red      chalk lines are rainproof and practically indelible. Don't      use it on wet wood-damp chalk will gum up the inside      of the case. If you can't hang the string's tab over a      board end, drive a nail partway in at the starting point      and hook the tab over that. If you have to mark a long      line, have another person snap the middle of the string      while you hold the taut end. Need an <em>exceptionally</em>      long mark? Have that assistant pin the string down in the      middle and then snap the line on both sides.    </p>    <p>      One more thing to consider before you cut: You'll need to      support your board on sawhorses or a table. Don't brace      both ends and cut in the middle; the board will sag in and      trap your saw blade. Instead, support the long side of the      board, as close to the cutting line as possible, then saw      off the short side.    </p>    <p>      You'll have to vary that arrangement if both pieces are      going to be long. Otherwise, the free-falling piece will be      so heavy it'll break off before you finish cutting and      leave a splintery stub. In that case, ask a friend to hold      the free end. If no one's around, put a third sawhorse      under the falling piece, not at its far end (remember the      pinching problem), but near the middle of the falling      piece, just a little toward the cut (Fig. 5).    </p>    <p>      When cutting a big piece of plywood, you can set two boards      on two sawhorses, lay your plywood on top of them so the      cutting line runs between the sawhorses, and then cut as      little into the support boards as possible.    </p>  <h3> Cutting</h3>    <p>      Handsaw or circular saw? <em>Handsaws</em> are less      popular-they're slower and more tiring to      use-but they will get the job done. If you use one,      concentrate on keeping it Straight, and don't let its body      twist sideways into the wood. Hold it at a 45° angle,      start the notch with a few pulling strokes, then push and      pull with an even, steady motion that lets the saw do most      of the work. You can steady the board with your opposite      knee and reach over to grab the waste end with your free      hand right before it breaks off to keep the wood from      tearing.    </p>    <p>      Getting tired? The saw may well be dull. Have it sharpened,      and you'll be amazed how much stronger you suddenly become.      Also, be sure you're using a <em>crosscut saw</em> (the      ordinary one with lots of little teeth) for cutting across      boards and a <em>ripsaw</em> (fewer and larger teeth) for      cutting with the grain.    </p>    <p>      Having trouble following the line? Examine your mistake. If      you're cutting a straight line but it bears left or right,      the fault is yours. Practice holding the saw straight to      the line while you cut. If the top of the cut is on the      line but the bottom is beveled (slanted) in or out, you're      not holding the saw blade vertically square to the board.      Hold a square up against the blade as a guide while you cut      (Fig. 6) until you develop an eye for sawing correctly. If      your cuts all have curves, your saw blade is bent. Get      another saw.    </p>    <p>      <em>Circular saws</em> (Skilsaw is a popular trade model)      are definitely the most common cutting tool-but watch      out, they're dangerous! <em>Never</em> let that spinning      blade get near your hands, legs or any other part of your      body. <em>Never</em> let it cut its own power cord. Never      get the blade pinched in a cut-it can kick back into      you. Never put a blade on with its teeth going the wrong      way (the saw will jump out of the cut). <em>Don't</em> jam      its blade guard open to "make things easier."      <em>Always</em> cut with the saw on the supported side of      the board, not on the one that will fall off.      <em>Unplug</em> it when you want to adjust the blade or      leave the worksite. In other words, treat that tool with      lots of respect.    </p>  <h3> The real secret to carpentry? Don't lose your      tools.</h3>    <p>      But don't let me scare you off: A circular saw is immensely      useful. It can cut at angles. With special blades, it can      saw through a variety of materials (even concrete). And it      can make those standard straight cuts with ease.    </p>    <p>      For straight cuts, first make sure the blade is set just      1/8" deeper than your board (it works more efficiently and      tears the wood less). Then hold the saw so the power cord      and your body are out of the way, start the motor and let      it reach full speed before the blade enters the wood.      Unfortunately, the guide sights at the front of a circular      saw often don't work well as guides (don't ask me why), so      you have to look around the side and watch the blade itself      moving along your cutting line. That means you'll need to      wear safety goggles to keep flying sawdust out of your      eyes. (Earplugs are good, too, for muffling the noise.)    </p>    <p>      The first inch of a cut is all-important. Get that straight      and the saw'll pretty much steer itself. If it's off your      line, though, pull the saw out and start again. If      necessary, hold the blade guard handle back with one hand,      and evenly push the saw all the way through the wood with      the other, letting it rest flush on the supported board      (Fig. 7). Don't push it too hard-forcing the tool      increases the risk of accident and can damage the motor.      Don't try to back a circular saw out of a cut while it's      running-it may kick back instead. Turn the motor off      as soon as the cut is finished, but don't put the saw down      until the safety guard has snapped back into place and      completely covered the blade.    </p>    <p>      <em>Leave the line</em> . This carpenter's axiom means you      want to cut just along the waste side of your penciled      line, so you can still see the line on the wood piece you      use. Why? Because the width of a saw cut (the kerf) can be      substantial (1/8" or more), so if you cut <em>on</em> the      line, you'll remove wood from your measured side, as well.      (For the same reason, don't mark a series of cuts all at      once on a board: The kerf waste will throw them off. Mark      one, cut one. Then mark the next, cut the next.) So don't      forget: Cut so the line stays on the piece you want,      <em>not</em> on the waste piece.    </p>    <p>      Are you having trouble making the saw run straight across      the cut? Then once you've got it lined up to start your      cut, set a speed (or other) square flush against the saw's      other side, and hold it there while you cut. That'll help      keep your saw on course and give you a beautiful finished      cut. A speed square's 45°-angled side makes an      especially useful guide when you need to make 45° cuts.    </p>   <h3> Nailing</h3>    <p>      Finally, the soul (and sometimes frustration) of carpentry:      driving nails. Real carpenters can wham a nail home in two      or three hits, but that skill comes with practice,      <em>lots</em> of practice. (I still can't do it.) These      tricks will help, though.    </p>    <p>      First, pick a hammer that feels comfortable: properly      balanced and neither too heavy to use repeatedly nor too      light to have much impact (try one about 16 or 20 ounces).      That'll make a big difference.    </p>    <p>      Next, get the right size nail. The rule of thumb here is      that the nail should go twice as far into the second board      as it traveled through the first-i.e., its length      should be three times the thickness of the first board.      You'll want a <em>common</em> flatheaded nail for ordinary      jobs, a spiral (spiral-shanked) nail when you need extra      holding power and a <em>finishing</em> (no-headed) nail for      inside jobs where you don't want the head to show (Fig. 8).      If your work's going to be exposed to weather, use      <em>galvanized</em> nails. They resist rust.    </p>    <p>      Hold your nail in place, either with your thumb and      forefinger or-if you want to protect your      fingertips- between your palm-up fingers, like a      cigarette. If you're nailing a really tiny nail or you're      in an awkward position, you might use needle-nose pliers,      cardboard, putty or chewing gum to hold the nail in place.    </p>    <p>      Tap the nail to secure it, remove your hand, hit it a bit      harder once or twice (not full force, or you may send it      zinging off into space) and then pound it in. At first, you      may tend to use your wrist too much when driving nails      because that gives you finer control (fewer misses). Try      instead to get your entire arm into the act with a loose,      swinging motion. You'll hit with more power and tire less      quickly. Also, resist choking up on the hammer to increase      your accuracy. Make yourself learn from the get-go how to      do it right.    </p>    <p>      Is the nail going in crooked? Well, if it's a third or more      in, it's too late to reorient it. Pull it out and try      again. Happen again? You may be trying to nail through a      knot or curved grain. If so, you'll have to predrill your      hole (drill it slightly smaller and shorter than the nail)      to get <em>any</em> nail to go in straight.    </p>    <p>      Is the nail-curses!-bending over? That'll      happen a lot if the wood's too hard to nail easily. In that      case, make sure you're not using too puny a nail for the      job at hand, or try rubbing soap or wax on the nails to      help them slide in. Or simply eliminate the hassle by      predrilling your nail holes. Of course, the problem may be      that you're hammering the nailhead at an angle instead of      straight on. Only practice will solve <em>that</em>      problem.    </p>        <p>      In the meantime, you may be able to tap that bent nail in      by carefully banging straight on its head (if you're      lucky), or you could try to straighten it out with sideways      blows. If neither trick works, you've got to pull the nail      out. Grab the culprit with the claws on the back end of      your hammer, put the tool's head down on the board (you can      lay a putty knife or thin wood strip under the hammerhead      to keep it from marring the board) and pull. If you do put      a small block of wood under your hammerhead, you'll have      extra leverage and pulling power- that's a big help      once the nail's partway out (Fig. 9).    </p>    <h3>Wooden shims are the carpenter's way of      cheating.</h3>    <p>      What's that? The nail just won't come out? This time bend      the hammer down <em>sideways</em> instead of pulling it      back. This'll bring out almost any nail, but it'll be too      bent to reuse.    </p>    <p>      Suppose you drove the nail in just fine, but then you      realized that the boards were placed wrong, so now you need      to take it out. The hammer claws won't squeeze under the      nailhead, so try banging the top board from the back and      then the front to see if that makes the nailhead protrude      enough to grip. No luck? Use a flat-faced pry bar (a      wonderful tool that's often appropriately called a wonder      bar), and either wedge it under the nailhead or use it to      pry the two boards apart so you can pound the nail point.    </p>    <p>      Does the wood split when you drive a nail? If so, don't      position the nails too close to the end of a board. Try to      keep them at least as far away from the edge as the board      is thick. Also, make sure all your nails aren't going in      the same stretch of wood grain. Stagger them.      <em>Still</em> splitting? Blunt the tip of the nail with a      few hammer hits before you drive it. It'll then tear, not      pry, its way through the fibers and be less likely to split      the wood. Still splitting? Sorry. Guess it's time to      predrill your holes again.    </p>    <p>      When you're nailing one board onto the edge or end of      another ( <em>edge or end nailing</em> ), the union will be      stronger if you drive your nails in at slight alternating      angles rather than all straight down. The same holds true      for <em>face nailing</em> , nailing two boards back to      back. If the face-nailed boards are both the same width,      you can't use the 3X rule of thumb to determine nail      length. Instead, pick nails that would protrude slightly if      nailed straight down, then drive them in at angles.    </p>    <p>      Actually, if appearance isn't a factor, you can use longer      nails for face nailing and <em>clinch</em> them for a joint      that just plain won't come apart. Drive the nail all the      way through. Bend the nail tip over with your hammer claws.      Then hammer the nail over and flat. The bent tip will stick      back into the wood.    </p>    <p>      If you're doing finishing work, you don't want to have      nailheads or round hammerhead marks (carpenters call them      donkey tracks) in the wood, so use finishing nails with no      heads. Then when the nail gets close to the wood, grab a      <em>nail set</em> . (It looks somewhat like an iron pencil.      The "lead" fits into a dimple in the little finishing      nail's top and you hammer on the "eraser" end.) Drive the      nailhead a bit into the wood with the nail set (Fig. 10),      and fill the resulting hole with wood putty.    </p>    <p>      My least favorite kind of hammering is <em>toenailing</em>      , angle nailing through one board into another. The classic      toenail goes out the end of one board and into a second,      right-angled one (Fig. 11). It's hard to do. You can split      the board end off, drive too low or too high or push the      board out of position.    </p>    <p>      To avoid these mishaps, start your nail at a spot on the      board halfway up the nail's length. Drive it almost square      to the wood until you get it started, then turn it to a      45° angle and pound it on down. If the board end      splits, blunt the nail tip, start higher up on the board      and/or predrill the hole. To keep your hammering from      pushing the top board off line, start that board off the      line in the <em>other</em> direction to compensate ahead of      time for its tendency to slide. Or start a toenail on the      opposite side of the board, and alternate driving the two      nails to keep the board in place. Or simply hold the board      in place with your foot, a wood block or clamps.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the fact that a toenailed board tends to move      comes in handy when you do need to move a board over to a      chalked line or nail a bowed board to a straight one. Just      start a toenail in the direction you want the board to go      and pound away!    </p>    <p>      One last nail tip: <em>Never</em> leave a nail in a loose      piece of wood, most especially if its point is sticking      out. Otherwise, sooner or later, without fail, somebody      will injure either a tool or a foot on it. (One of my      contractor buddies stepped on five such nails in one day,      but luckily his extra-thick soles prevented real injury.)    </p>   <h3> Other Tools and Aids</h3>    <p>      Another surprisingly useful carpentry tool is      <em>string</em> . It seems like anytime you want to      establish a line to build to, you have to run out a taut      length of string. Nylon is best; it's strong. To draw and      tie it tight, use this trick: Drive a nail where the string      needs to end, loop it around the nail eight or more times,      then make another loop, draw the string through it, lay      that round the nail and tighten (Fig. 12). It's remarkably      easy to do and <em>undo</em> that knot.    </p>  <h3> PENNY (D) NAIL SIZE IN INCHES</h3>    <p>      Why are nails sized in "pennies"? In England, they used to      be sold by the hundred. One hundred 2" nails cost six      pennies, so they became known as sixpenny (6d) nails!<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Penny        Length        No.per Lb.</strong>    </p>    <p>      2d        1        847    </p>    <p>      4d        1½        296    </p>    <p>      6d        2        167    </p>    <p>      8d        2½        01    </p>    <p>      10d        3        66    </p>    <p>      12d        3¼        56    </p>    <p>      16d        3½        47    </p>    <p>      20d        4        30    </p>    <p>      String lines often help when you want to level      something-and you're leveling all the time in      building. A <em>spirit level</em>and a<em>plumb bob</em>are      pretty straightforward tools (Fig. 13). The former has a      bubble in a vial to help you check that things are level      horizontally (often called simply level), and often another      vial to check that something's level vertically (or plumb).      A plumb bob, a weight on a string, is good for leveling      vertically or checking that one object is centered over      another. Be sure to use these tools precisely (don't let      the bubble in a spirit level be just "slightly off      center"). Use a level in more than one direction (for      instance, make sure that post is plumb front to back as      well as left to right). Make sure you're holding a level      against a straight, smooth surface (a good reason to use it      in more than one spot). And <em>recheck</em> something for      level or plumb after you finish nailing or securing it.    </p>        <p>      <em>Shims</em> are little wedges of wood you use as spacers      when, for one reason or another, things don't quite meet as      they should. You just push the shim in the gap as far as      necessary (to fill the gap completely, drive one shim in      from one side and another from the other) and then nail.      They're the carpenter's way of cheating-and they're      so useful that lumberyards call them "cedar shakes" and      sell them by the bundle.    </p>    <p>      There are a few other tools that even the beginning      carpenter will probably need. You've just got to have a      <em>drill;</em> electric is best. <em>Screwdrivers</em>      come in handy all the time. You need several so you'll have      the right size for the screw you're driving. (Remember that      if wood is quite hard, you can predrill the screw holes.)      Three or four <em>nail sets</em> will take care of your      finish nailing needs. A <em>staple gun, pliers</em>      (particularly locking pliers) and a <em>utility knife</em>      (it holds razor edges for cutting) are ordinary tools with      lots of uses.    </p>    <p>      A set of three or four <em>wood chisels</em> will help you      in a multitude of ways. A <em>sliding T-bevel</em> (Fig.      14) is like a small square, but it has one free-moving,      adjustable side. You can use it to "capture" any nonsquare      angle and "transfer" it to a board you're cutting. (Always      double-check the transferred angle before you cut.) Some      kind of <em>plane</em> will help you smooth surfaces and      shave off that inconvenient extra width. (The easiest type      to use, in my opinion, is Surform. It has replaceable      cheese-grater-type blades.) And <em>safety goggles</em> can      save your eyes from flying chips of wood or metal. The ones      with real eyeglass frames are much better than the clear,      all-plastic type that scratch and fog up easily.    </p>    <h3>Miscellaneous Tips</h3>    <p>      Always make a complete drawing of everything you plan to      build. And be sure to include the <em>width</em> of the      material in your calculations. If you're making a simple      square box, for instance, with the two side walls inside      the two end ones, those side walls will have to be cut two      widths shorter than the end ones to keep the box square.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of widths, you probably already know that a 2 X 4      isn't really 2" by 4", just as a 1 X 6 isn't really 1" by      6". Boards get planed a bit from this <em>nominal</em> size      in their final milling. So a 2 X 4 is actually 1½ by      3½", and a 1 X 6 is ¾" by 5½”.    </p>    <p>      Put the information in the last two paragraphs together and      you can figure out why the most common 2X4 board, the      <em>stud</em> , used to frame all those 8'-tall walls, is      actually 3" shy of being 8' long. Have you got it? The stud      in a framed wall, like the inside walls of a box, sits on a      2 X 4 and is topped by a 2 X 4. The real width of those two      boards (1½ plus 1½") adds up to 3", so the      stud has to be 3" short for a wall exactly 8' tall.    </p>    <p>      Never leave the end of a board dangling between supports in      anything you build. Always nail it to something. (Add some      backing, called <em>blocking</em> , if need be.) If another      board's going to butt up against the first one, you'll want      to cut the first board so it ends halfway across that      nailing surface (Fig. 15). Then you'll have something left      to nail the other board to.    </p>    <p>      Want to be sure a large corner makes a true right angle?      Measure 3' out one side and 4' out the other. If the      distance between those points (the hypotenuese of a right      triangle) is 5', you're on the mark.    </p>    <p>      Do you want to know if any rectangular structure you've      laid out-from a box to a house site-is square?      Measure the diagonals. If they're equal (and, indeed, all      four corners are right angles and the opposite sides are      equal), you're in business.    </p>    <h3>Building Fever</h3>    <p>      Obviously, I can't tell you everything about carpentry in      one article-even if I knew it! In fact, I haven't      actually told you how to build <em>anything</em> ; I've      just tried to help you start using the tools. You'll have      to figure out your own projects. Better yet, get a      carpenter friend to make some drawings for you of that      first bookcase or woodshed. Getting that kind of design      help while you sit together over a cup of hot tea can be      indispensable.    </p>    <p>      But once your builder friend's finished those sketches and      you're out there alone with tape, hammer and a stack of      boards waiting like a disassembled jigsaw puzzle,      <em>then</em> some of my advice may well come in handy and      help you avoid some of the goofs I made while I was      learning these simple lessons.    </p>
