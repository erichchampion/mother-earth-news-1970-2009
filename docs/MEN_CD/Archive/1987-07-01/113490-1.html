        A more subdued tone marks this sprawling kingdom<br />of a ranch now that the boss is dead, killed a couple of years ago<br />when his car was demolished by a pickup in the hands of a<br />20-year-old who had put away way too much bourbon, or<br />something. But the barbecues the boss and Mary Sue held<br />after stock sales or to celebrate holidays with friends and<br />family have become legends in a state where legends don't<br />rise easily. His voice, unabashed and penetrating, can<br />still be heard in his neighbors' memories, booming across<br />the prairie.Â
