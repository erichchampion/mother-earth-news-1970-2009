        <p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p><p>I recently had to devise a method for heating my dog's water. I took an old steel tube, about 3 1/2" in diameter and capped on one end, dropped it into the water tub, attached it to the side, then dropped a few lit charcoal briquettes in. Voila-instant submersion heater!</p><p>I use plumber's strap to hold it ...loosely. That way I can slide it out to dump the ashes. Works like a champ-even better, in fact, now that I've put a baffle down the center of the tube and angled the tube for better drafting of the rising hot air.</p><p>Another option would be to recover an RV water heater burner tube. All you would need is a cutting torch, some plumber's strap, and a piece of tin or aluminum siding (to extend the internal baffle). Be sure to remember to empty tie ashes before the water refreezes. That way, your heater will be ready for tie next refill when you are.</p><p>Thought it might be a useful idea, since it worked so well for me.</p><p>Jeff Frusha<br />Commerce, Texas</p>
