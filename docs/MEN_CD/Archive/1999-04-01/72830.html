        <p><strong>BITS AND PIECES</strong></p><p>The wait's over for a fun, fast, and affordable e-bike.</p><p>The solar electric bike has sped merrily along since the fun, fast, and exorbitantly priced $1,100 experimental prototype we tested and wrote about a couple of years ago. Since then, we're happy to report, the design has been picked up and mass-manufactured: electric hikes are now available as either add-on power kits, for as low as $300 to $600, or as full-production electric models, which sell for anywhere between $325 and $1,500.</p><p>The design has remained essentially the same. The battery packs are mounted on the frame beneath the seat, and the bikes can be recharged from any 100-volt AC electric outlet or by solar photovoltaic panels.</p><p>Electric bikes can travel 15 to 20 miles-at speeds of 15 to 20 mph-without recharging. And not only can you now affordably get your hands on the handlebars, if you're really motivated, you can probably get an electric bike-commuter program started in your town, using a just-completed one-year project in Palm Springs as a model.</p><p>Zap Power Systems of Sebastopol, CA, offers a variety of E-powered options, including the popular EletriCruizer (left), the ZAP Patrol (bottom left)-an electric mountain bike used by police in Fresno, CA and elsewhere-and the Zappy (below), a 35-pound scooter that can travel up to 8 miles without recharging, at speeds of up to 13 mph.</p><p>Palm Springs' E-Bikes program used 30 electric bikes and 16 recharging stations set up at key city locations. Anyone interested could try out one of the E-bikes by leaving a $30 deposit. The program, funded by auto registration fees and state grant money, cost $70,000, which covered the bikes, the charging stations, and the cost of putting together a survey and report.</p><p>But Palm Springs Transportation Manager Robert Mohler says you don't have to spend that much to get a commuter program going. "You can start with as little as three or four bikes and one charging station," he suggests.</p><p>Who should you target? Palm Springs' extensive E-Bike survey found, says Mohler, "a customer that's not necessarily a jock." In other words, people who are commuting on electric hikes probably wouldn't ride a regular bike to work. "They are regular car drivers," says Mohler, "who are willing to do something for the environment"-like substituting short car trips for short electric bike trips.</p><p>Now that the project is finished, the bikes are being dispersed among Palm Springs' city departments, including law enforcement.</p><p>In fact, police departments are relying increasingly on electric bikes. According to Alex Campbell, spokesman for ZAP Power Systems-the nation's original ebike manufacturer-his company has delivered electric bikes to over 130 law enforcement agencies, including traditional police forces, campus security forces, and national park patrols.</p><p>ZAP has sold 20,000 electric bikes since 1994, and Campbell is very optimistic about the future. "We wanted to make a hike that anybody can afford, that's easy to use, and fun. Electric bikes are going to be the first electric vehicles to sell in the millions."</p><p>-Molly Miller</p><p>To learn more about starting an electric bike commuter program in your city, contact the city of Palm Springs Transportation Department at (760) 323-8179.
