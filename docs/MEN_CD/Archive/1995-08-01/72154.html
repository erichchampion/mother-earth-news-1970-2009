                <p>      <strong>SHUSWAP DIARY</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>The Adams River Run: A trip of a lifetime for      Sockeye Salmon.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Deaiina Kawatski    </h5>          <p>        -Deaiina Kawatski      </p>      <p>        Throughout my wandering years Shuswap Lake was the        geographical center around which my life orbited. With        stunning regularity I heard it call and with a deep        yearning I returned to touch down in the place where I        had been born. I returned home.      </p><p>In 1974, dressed in a massive muskrat coat, high red      boots, and a brimmed hat pinned up at the front with a      serpent brooch, I flew home from Paris. I was 22 years old.      I came home with the smell of roasted chestnuts and Vincent      Van Gogh's self-portrait still lingering in my mind. I came      home with a treasure chest of stories and an empty purse. I      intended to refill it once I got a job planting trees.</p>            <p>        On their way upstream, spawning male salmon experience        a<br />        color change to an aggressive scarlet and develop<br />        a territory-defending hook on their mouths.      </p>      <p>        Seeking solitude, I retreated to the beach where I        breathed in deeply the rich and healing air. Sitting on a        rock, I nestled up to the waves and let the swirl of        water wash my mind and restore my peace. This was the        same shore where as a toddler I had tripped, tasted        rocks, and experienced the ecstasy of the blue and green        embrace of the natural world.      </p>      <p>        Sitting still, I listened to the snow melt. Yet how well        I knew the perils of lingering too long. If spring began        to sway forth, as hypnotic as the flute to a cobra, I        knew that I would get stuck at Shuswap Lake. I wouldn't        be able to move again. But I was still infatuated with        the faraway and possessed by a restlessness that, if        harnessed, could have moved mountains. But once I set        foot on the shore of Shuswap Lake, I felt myself melt        into the land. I had been deprived of this place for much        of my childhood. After my father died, my mother had        found work in a nearby city and we moved. My sister and        brother had also suffered a lifelong denial of their        birthright-to live and grow beneath the Shuswap sun and        moon. We could only experience it in brief and dazzling        summer displays.      </p>      <p>        Neither brother nor sister fought the urge to settle        here. They each took a token trip abroad, then promptly        returned and began to build homes and raise families.      </p>      <p>        Our community recently celebrated a slightly more        significant homecoming-one which has been recurring        for thousands of years-ever since the glaciers of the Ice        Age carved out the land as we now know it. North        Shuswap's Adams River is home to the world's largest        return of sockeye salmon to a single river. As many as        300,000 people from dozens of countries come each season        to witness this ritual of return, which peaks every four        years.      </p>      <p>        On October 17, I caught a ride 18 miles to the Adams        River run. I had chosen what I thought would be a quiet        Monday. Emerging from my friend's car, I stood baffled by        what is normally a near-empty parking lot. Every inch of        the lot was crammed with cars, while the western edge was        lined with a total of 23 school buses. Before reaching        the river, I passed by a row of five food booths run by        local nonprofit groups; an audio-visual display tent; a        souvenir booth selling books, buttons, T-shirts, posters,        and postcards; and a long row of portable toilets.        Throngs of people milled about and filed down the        footpaths where it was nearly impossible to wander alone.      </p>      <p>        The sky was pewter and held the promise of later rain. My        first stop was a footbridge, which spanned a side        channel, but through the mesh of people it was a struggle        to even see the water. A parade of people in wheelchairs        filed across the bridge, while nearby mothers who had        volunteered their time fought to bring order to unruly        gangs of students. Choruses of, "Oh, look at the dead        ones!" resounded from the school children, while one boy        with purple braces and a too-loud voice proclaimed, "I        wanna see a fish die!"      </p>      <p>        Escaping upstream, I paused in front of a sturdy stone        bearing a plaque in honor of Roderick Haig-Brown        (1908-1978), for whom the park was named. Author,        magistrate, and conservationist, Haig-Brown fought long        and hard to preserve this vital birthplace of the sockeye        salmon. It wasn't until 1989 that the park was granted a        class A status, which gives it the highest level of        protection possible. His passionate poem, "Pacific        Salmon," is carved in its entirety beneath a relief        carving of Haig-Brown's shining profile. Somehow I could        sense his presence still, watching the return of the fish        that he loved.      </p>      <p>        There seemed to be more people than fish as I fought my        way to a quieter spot, passing a freckled boy who was        busy poking at a salmon carcass with a stick. Retreating        from the main route, I scrambled through a stand of        cedar, hemlock, and Douglas fir, and arrived in a        surprisingly secluded spot beside the river. Scores of        sockeye salmon flickered through the water, while on the        far shore throngs of fish watchers flowed through the        burnt orange foliage.      </p>      <p>        Vibrating vigorously, sockeye salmon fought their way        upstream. The miracle is that they make it back at all        from an ocean vast and wavering to the very place where        they emerged from the jewel eggs deposited by their        parents. Their sense of territory is made clear by the        spacing of pairs and the furious fights for river bottom.        Bursting through the antique luster of the autumn river,        crimson bodies followed bottle-green snouts. The will to        protect ricocheted through a sleek male, ending with a        saucy whip of the tail. Bloated and decaying bodies        blended with the bottom and washed up on shore. Most        pathetic were the ones still waiting to die, their sides        mottled a sick white, their fins ragged from the terrors        of distant battles for ground. The stench of rotting        flesh permeated the cool air.      </p>            <p>        My eyes latched on to a battle between two males, and I        realized how much damage their hooked jaws could do. They        dig their nests, engage in combat, mate, lay their eggs,        and die all in one remarkable rush of Chi. What appeared        to be merely a mass of struggling red muscle and fin, of        bulging eyes intent upon their mission, was really the        end of an epic journey.      </p>      <p>        After leaving the Pacific Ocean, the sockeye salmon had        braved      </p>      <p>        a trip of over 300 miles up the Fraser, Thompson, and        South Thompson rivers. The Adams River is but one small        branch of the Fraser River system. Some scientists        believe that it is their sense of smell that leads them        home to these very waters which serve not only as a        cradle but also as a grave. Dissolved soil and plant        material may give rivers different smells. Yet this        journey is minuscule compared to the one the salmon        engage in at sea, through a wavering wilderness of kelp.        Millions of salmon ancestors have traveled the 2,000-mile        migration route, but no path is ever left behind. Do they        navigate by the stars? By the sun? By the earth's        magnetic field? Theories abound, but the mystery remains        intact.      </p>      <p>        Once they have left the ocean, the salmon stop eating and        go through a dramatic physical transformation. The males        mutate into humpbacked monsters. Their teeth protrude and        their snouts become hooked so that it is no longer        possible for them to close their mouths. Devouring their        own stores of body fat, the skin of both sexes turn from        silver to the scarlet red of the carotenoids they fed on        at sea. Swimming an average of 18 miles a day, it takes        the fish about 18 days to swim from the mouth of the        Fraser to their spawning grounds.      </p>      <p>        When the adult sockeye at last reach home, every movement        is made in the spirit of procreation. Even as they use up        the last of their fat reserves, enzymes have already        begun to rot their flesh. As the females battle for        spawning space and the males fight to protect them, they        have already begun to die.      </p>                      <p>          I watched from the bank as a female searched for a          suitable site to lay her eggs. The site must be          silt-free coarse gravel in moving water so that the          eggs will receive necessary oxygen. Finally ready to          spawn, the female turned on her side, and violently          fanning her tail, she lifted gravel from the bottom,          creating a small depression called a "redd" As the          female settled to the bottom of the nest, her partner          moved in. Shivering, they simultaneously released their          offerings for procreation-a chain of orange pink eggs          from the female while the male released a shower of          milt. Promptly the female darted upstream and dug          another redd. The unearthed gravel drifted downstream          and covered the depression dug prior. Moving steadily          upstream this process was repeated until the female had          laid 3,000 to 4,000 eggs. The female may spawn with          other males as well, but once they have passed their          essence on, they die within days.        </p>        <p>          Throughout the entire cycle, the salmon are battling          against considerable odds. Even after the eggs are          deposited they run the risk of being disturbed by          another female digging her redd. They must also be          protected from light and predators. Throughout the          hushed winter months, the river mothers the eggs,          washing waste away from them and nourishing them with          oxygen. Finally, in February, the most curious          creatures emerge. With translucent bodies, the only          solid-looking parts of the alevin are the steel-gray          eye and the poppy-colored yolk-sac. In keeping with the          wisdom of nature, by the time the alevins have absorbed          the nutrients from the yolk-sac, the river has warmed,          luring the silvery fry from their gravel cradles.        </p>        <p>          Beneath the mantle of night to protect them from          predators, the fry slip downstream to Shuswap Lake.          There they spend one year feeding on plankton and          minute crustaceans. What is tragic is the progressive          toll taken on their numbers. Out of four thousand eggs          laid by each female, only 800 hatch and survive to fry          stage. After one year in the lake, at the mercy of          predatory jaws and other perils, only 200 fry remain.        </p>        <p>          The next spring, the surviving fish-now graduated          to the status of smolts-migrate to the Pacific          Ocean. Before entering the ocean, however, they linger          in estuaries or cling to the coast, adjusting to the          salinity. A mere seven to 10 survive the hazards at          sea, and once the fishermen and other predators have          struck, a stunning two sockeye salmon return home to          spawn.        </p>        <p>          Throughout the peak season, provincial papers and          radios buzzed with speculation about the "missing          salmon." Some termed them paper salmon and attributed          the low numbers to miscalculations. Others blamed          overfishing, warmer water temperatures, and a host of          other factors.        </p>        <p>          The decline in numbers contrasts sharply with early          accounts from the 1800s, which spoke of multiple runs          every year. The sockeye salmon would fill the rivers          from shore to shore, with the passing of thousands in          an hour accompanied by a fierce noise like the roar of          a storm, and succeeded by a series of vigorous waves.          According to Shuswap Indian lore, the arrival of the          sockeye run was heralded by the singing of crickets and          a west wind that began to blow steadily around the          first week of October. This wind was known by the          elders as "the breath of the salmon" and it helped to          dry the salmon on the racks.        </p>        <p>          Unfortunately, from 1908 until 1922 a logging company          tampered with nature in a way that caused permanent          damage to the sockeye runs. At the head of the Adams          River, at the outlet of Adams Lake, a splash dam was          built. With it the company created flash floods to move          the logs down to the Shuswap Lake market. Each time a          massive wall of wood and water hurled downstream, the          salmon in its path were either killed outright or swept          away. Even the eggs left by those that managed to spawn          were either scoured from the river bottom or were left          as exposed offerings to the elements and predators.        </p>        <p>          To complicate matters, in 1913 a landslide caused by          railroad construction at Hell's Gate constricted the          salmon's passage up the Fraser River. Finally, in 1922,          the brutal creation of the flash floods came to an end,          but for the Upper Adams River run it was too late.          Exhausted from battling the barrier, the salmon finally          succumbed and came no more. Historically, it was          thought to be a larger run than the lower Adams run,          which people flock to view today.        </p>        <p>          In our modern world, every inch of the way wild salmon          are under siege, be it by logging, pollution, urban          development, the controversial practice of aquaculture,          dams, water diversion and overfishing. All of these          threats are caused and can be controlled only by the          human race.        </p>        <p>          For many of the local people, the Adams River salmon          run means little besides traffic congestion and delays          crossing the Adams River bridge. I've heard it          described as "boring," "too commercial," and          "overblown:" Many don't even venture forth to view this          world-class attraction. Some of the old-timers simply          shake their heads and laugh at the fools that come to          gawk at a bunch of fish. The booths within the park are          nonprofit, a policy which prevents residents from          benefiting economically from the influx of tourists          into an area just regaining its peace after the summer          invasion, but I know of one enterprising young woman          who sold T-shirts in nearby Chase bearing the slogans          "Sex to Die For" and "Spawn 'til You're Gone."          Throughout the season the ceiling of my son Ben's grade          3-4 classroom was encircled by the life cycle of the          salmon. Besides a trip to the run, the students made          and painted the paper salmon dangling above them and          also wrote stories about them. What young Christopher          Adams found most interesting about the run was "I          couldn't believe how few fish there were. Four years          ago you couldn't even see the bottom." Words of a          future environmentalist, I hope.        </p>        <p>          Late in the afternoon before leaving the run, I saw an          elderly woman with pearl earrings viewing the fish with          a Kleenex held over her nose. Staring into the wrinkled          water, she read death in the hieroglyphics of salmon          bodies going through their final earth turnings. I          think we both felt fresh appreciation for the life          breath that flowed through us still. Returning home was          an end for me, but also a beginning.        </p>
