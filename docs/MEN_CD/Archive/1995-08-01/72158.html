                <p>      <strong>NATURAL KITCHEN</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Indulging in your fresh garden bounty.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      Oh happy day, it's harvest time again. For those of us who      planted a garden, we're up to our ears in root vegetables,      squash, leeks, tomatoes, greens, and whatever else decided      to pop up. If you don't have a garden, maybe your back      porch is full of bushel baskets from the nearest stand,      just waiting for your undivided attention. With all that      picking, canning, freezing, and eating on the agenda, no      one has time for fancy cooking. We've tried to help you      ease into the harvest season gracefully with some easy      favorites that you may not have tried before. And if you      still have some leftover produce, don't panic, just bless      the neighbors.    </p>    <h3>      Greens    </h3>    <p>      Greens have mainly been appreciated in Southern-style      cuisine, but are gaining popularity everywhere.. They're      rich in chlorophyll, which is what makes the leaves dark      green and full of vitamin A and C, especially when eaten      raw. If you're cutting back on dairy products and are      concerned about your calcium intake, then greens are the      solution without the cholesterol.    </p>    <h3>      Cooking Greens    </h3>    <p>      The Southern method is to boil them for about 30 minutes,      drain, and then saute in bacon fat. Since we want to      preserve nutrients and lower the fat, stir-frying is the      best way to cook them. Stir the chopped greens in a hot      skillet with olive oil, garlic, and hot pepper for a few      minutes until wilted. The greens should be bright green,      and a bit chewy.    </p>    <h3>      Kale Salad    </h3>        <p>      Kale salad has loads of flavor, and holds up better than      spinach<br />      when tossed with a hot dressing    </p>    <p>      Remember when we used to eat spinach salad with bacon      dressing? Delicious, but too high in fat by today's      standards and too soggy by the time the dressing soaked in.      Since kale is one of the most nutritious greens, I prefer      to make a kale salad, which has loads of flavor and holds      up better than spinach when tossed with a hot dressing.    </p><p><em>4 cups chopped kale leaves, packed down (chop</em>    <em>off the stems & cut across the leaf, cutting    one-hal-finch strips)</em><br />    <em>4 tablespoons lemon juice</em><br /><em>2 teaspoons Dijon    mustard</em><br />    <em>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</em><br />    <em>1/2 teaspoon sugar</em><br />    <em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em><br />    <em>1 small red pepper (or use 1 red & 1 yellow pepper)    cut into thin strips</em><br />    <em>1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced</em><br />    <em>3 large cloves garlic, minced</em><br />    <em>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar<br />    salt, pepper to taste</em></p>    <p>      Put the chopped kale in a large bowl. Whisk together the      lemon juice, mustard, sugar, and cayenne. Pour over the      kale. Saute the peppers in olive oil over medium-high heat      for a minute, then add the garlic. Saute until the      vegetables start to brown. Stir in the vinegar and remove      from heat. Toss into the salad with salt and pepper. Serve      immediately with crusty bread or homemade croutons.    </p>    <h3>      Sausage-Bean Soup with Greens    </h3>    <p>      Since greens are durable and will usually survive until the      first frost, this quick soup is perfect for a cool      September day.    </p>    <p>      You can use any combination of greens with the exception of      mustard greens, which tend to be too fragile for soup. Make      sure that you cut off the tough stems before chopping the      leaves. If you're going to be grilling, save some extra      sausage for the soup.    </p><p><em>1/2 lb. (or 2 pieces) cooked sausage such as chorizo,    turkey brats, kiebas, or linguica</em><br />    <em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em><br />    <em>3 large cloves garlic, minced 1 large onion, chopped one    15-ounce can chicken broth</em><br />    <em>5-6 cups water</em><br />    <em>1/2 teaspoon thyme</em><br />    <em>1/8 teaspoon cayenne</em><br />    <em>salt and pepper to taste</em><br />    <em>4 medium red or white new potatoes (about 1/4 Ibs),    halved and thinly sliced</em><br />    <em>2 medium carrots, thinly sliced diagonally into    circles</em><br />    <em>one 15 -19-ounce can cannellini (white kidney) or    northern beans, rinsed</em><br />    <em>6 cups loosely packed, coarsely chopped collard greens or    Swiss chard.</em></p>    <p>      Slice the sausage diagonally into 1/4-Inch circles. Set      aside. In a large soup pot, saute the garlic and onion in      the olive oil until translucent. Add the chicken broth,      five cups water, potatoes, carrots, and spices. Cover and      simmer for about 30 minutes. Add the sausages and beans,      and cook for five minutes. Stir in the greens and simmer      for another five minutes until the greens are limp. Add      extra water as needed. Adjust salt and pepper. Serve with      thick slices of bread.    </p>        <h3>      Pumpkin Bread    </h3>    <p>      Fortunately, the squash pumpkins will keep for a few months      in a cool place, so there's no rush on these. When you do      get to them, steam or bake four or five at once so you can      puree the pulp in the blender or food processor. Measure      out one cup of the puree into labeled freezer bags. For      pumpkin bread, I usually use pureed buttercup squash (a      turban-shaped, dark green squash) because of its rich      flavor.    </p>    <h3>      Squash or Pumpkin Puree    </h3>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350째-375째. Cut the squash in half      and scrape out the seeds.    </p>    <p>      Place cut-side down on a foil-lined cookie sheet and bake      for about half an hour until the squash can be pierced      easily with a knife.    </p>    <h3>      Pumpkin or Squash Bread    </h3><p><em>1 cup pumpkin or squash puree</em><br />    <em>I egg and1 egg white</em><br />    <em>1/4 cup brown sugar</em><br />    <em>1/4 cup real maple syrup<br />    1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</em><br />    <em>1/2 teaspoon ginger</em><br />    <em>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</em><br />    <em>1/4 teaspoon allspice</em><br />    <em>1 teaspoon vanilla</em><br />    <em>1/4 cup buttermilk</em><br />    <em>1/8 cup wheat germ</em><br />    <em>2 cups sifted whole wheat pastry flour (or unbleached    white flour)</em><br />    <em>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</em><br />    <em>1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</em><br />    <em>1/3 cup carob or mini-chocolate chips or chopped walnuts    (optional)</em></p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350째. Lightly grease the bottom of a      loaf pan (not glass). Try not to use a non-stick pan-the      bread may get too dark. Mix all the ingredients up to and      including the wheat germ with an electric mixer. Sift the      flour, baking soda, and baking powder into the measuring      cups. Slowly mix in the flour until just blended. Stir in      the carob chips, and pour into the pan.    </p>    <p>      Bake for 45-55 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes      out clean. If the top starts to get too brown, reduce the      oven temperature to 325째 for the last 10 minutes. Cool      on a rack before removing from the pan.    </p>    <h3>      Gardener's Stew    </h3>    <p>      You can use almost any vegetable in this vegetarian stew      and serve it one hour later over brown rice or couscous      with a dash of cinnamon. Leeks are milder than onions and      give the stew a nice flavor.    </p><p><em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em><br />    <em>2 leeks, washed well and thinly sliced just past where    the green tops begin</em><br />    <em>3 large cloves garlic, minced</em><br />    <em>1 small piece jalapeno pepper, seeded and    minced</em><br />    <em>2 small turnips, halved and thinly sliced</em><br />    <em>1 cup baby carrots, cut into one-inch chunks</em><br />    <em>4 small red potatoes, quartered</em><br />    <em>1 cup cauliflower chunks</em><br />    <em>one 15-ounce can garbanzo beans, rinsed</em><br />    <em>one 15-ounce can chicken broth (or vegetable    broth)</em><br />    <em>1 cup water</em><br />    <em>1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder</em><br />    <em>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</em><br />    <em>1/4 cup tomato paste</em><br />    <em>salt and pepper to taste</em><br />    <em>1 medium summer squash or yellow zucchini-cut into    one-inch pieces<br />    cilantro or parsley, chopped</em></p>    <p>      In a large pot, saute the leeks until light brown. Stir in      the garlic and hot pepper. Add the vegetables, beans,      broth, water and spices. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.      Add the summer squash and cook 15 more minutes until the      vegetables are tender. Serve over the rice or couscous and      top with chopped cilantro or parsley.    </p>    		<p><strong>Beet-Carrot Slaw</strong></p>    <p>      Most people cook beets, not realizing that they're      delicious grated raw, especially when you've just pulled      them out of the ground. They must be scrubbed well and only      peeled with a potato peeler if the skins are tough. If      you've stored some beets in the root cellar, this salad can      be made a month or so from now.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups each grated raw carrots grated raw      beets</em><br />      <em>1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon grated ginger root, peel before      grating</em><br />      <em>1 1/2 teaspoon sugar</em><br />      <em>1 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar</em><br />      <em>2 teaspoons sesame or canola oil</em><br />      <em>dash cayenne pepper and salt</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Grate the carrots and beets using a food processor or hand      grater. Whisk together the dressing. Toss with the carrots      and beets in a large bowl. Chill for at least two hours      before serving.    </p>    <p>      Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium-high      heat, shaking the pan every few seconds until the seeds are      lightly browned. Sprinkle on top of the salad.    </p>
