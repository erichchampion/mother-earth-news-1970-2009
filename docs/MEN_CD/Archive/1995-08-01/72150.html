                <p>      <strong>YOUR MONEY'S WORTH</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>How to save $5,000 per year on your transportation      expenses... and love doing it.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Roy Green    </h5>        <p>      Maya is the word for illusion in the Far East. In the West      it is called Consumerism. Back when my wife and I were      making decent salaries, it seemed like we were making more      than enough money on paper, but had little to show for it      at the end of the month. We simply spent too much, like the      good consumers we were. I felt as if I was the recipient of      a David Copperfield disappearing trick. "Where did it all      go?" I continually wondered. I never wanted something for      nothing, but was gradually becoming convinced that I was      getting nothing for something.    </p>    <p>      So I did some very thoughtful analysis of my financial      situation. I discovered that a major black hole in my      wallet was the money I poured into automobiles-money that I      would never recover.    </p>    <p>      I discovered, by default, that 90 percent of the money I      spent on cars evaporated in a haze of depreciation and      interest expenses. I paid about $250 per month for each of      our two cars, plus comprehensive insurance payments of      about $100 a month, costing a total of $7,200 per year. I      had to earn over $10,000 (before taxes) in salary to cover      those expenses. The AAA statistics indicate that the      average person pays $5,916 in car ownership cost per year,      so I was getting a good deal, comparatively. That cheered      me up about as much as when the doctor told me I didn't      have a fatal disease; I was just gradually wearing out.    </p>    <p>      Three years after my wife bought her car, we were tired of      it and ready to sell. The dealers and banker all let me      know that I could sell it for just about what we owed on      it. In other words, we were paying for merely the pleasure      of driving, not building any equity in the car at all. If I      could just manage to buy two $3,000 cars that would last      more than a year, I would begin to come out ahead. That is      what I was determined to do.    </p>    <p>      It's all too easy to suggest that buying used is always the      answer, and it was more than a little difficult for me for      three reasons: a) my ego, b) finding a good used car seemed      impossible, and c) I was afraid the repairs would offset      the monthly payments savings. So buying the right car was      essential to make the plan work. High maintenance costs      would eat up any savings in short order, so I did a good      deal of research. I read <em>Consumer Reports,</em> spoke      with mechanics, and read a lot of classified ads over the      course of a few years. I suggest you do the same to verify      my    </p><p>findings. Here is what I discovered:</p>    <h3>      Masda's 1987 626 Touring Sedan    </h3>           <h3>      1. What kind of used car to buy?    </h3>    <p>      a. Toyota, Honda, or Mazda.<br />      b. Dodge Minivan<br />      c. Ford, Chewy, or Dodge pickup<br />      d. Any sport utility vehicle (i.e.: Chewy Blazer, Isuzu      Trooper, Jeep Cherokee, etc.)    </p>    <p>      You probably could have guessed the first category. "Click"      and "Clack" worship at the used Toyota altar every weekend      on their National Public Radio call-in show, and I'm      surprised that everyone has not discovered this secret yet.      These cars are built to last at least 150,000 miles. I have      seen many of these with over 200,000 miles, running well      with the original engines and transmissions. They last if      the owners had followed the maintenance guidelines firmly,      especially in changing the oil religiously every 3,000      miles. The most common flaw in the cars that didn't make it      to 150,000 miles was that the radiator cooling fan switch      quit, causing the car to overheat, thereby blowing the head      gasket.    </p>    <p>      A Dodge Minivan is one of the best designed and engineered      vehicles in the history of the universe. It replaced the      legendary Plymouth Valiant as the Mona Lisa of vehicles      because it is so purely good in design. The best one comes      with a four-cylinder engine and manual transmission. Good      gas mileage, great space, impressive maintenance record,      and good resale value make it a winner.    </p>    <p>      In the pickup category, your best bets are the Ford F150      extended cab with a straight six and manual overdrive      transmission and the Dodge with the diesel engine. Any      Chevy will do well because they have such incredible resale      value.    </p>    <p>      If you are a typical North American consumer, you are      probably among the 47 percent of the car-buying public who      is considering a SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) for your next      purchase. They are very much in favor at the moment and as      a result resell at impressive prices. Since they are      relatively new on the market, the jury is still out on      their enduring value. I will venture to guess that just      about any of them will pass the 150,000 mile mark easily      because most of them have four-wheel drive. Any vehicle      built to withstand even occasional off-road use is way      overbuilt for the typical commuting regime.    </p>    <h3>      2. How old a car to buy?    </h3>    <p>      Five to seven years old. The depreciation curve flattens      after five to seven years. Let's use a 1995 Toyota Tercel      for an example.    </p>    <p>      The NADA blue book says this car will retail for: $8,375      after one year, $5,373 after two years, $4,375 after three      years, $3,450 after four years, $2,675 after five years,      $2,150 after six years, and $2,075 after seven years.      Verrry interesting, eh? (Car prices have increased each      year to keep up with inflation, so this is approximately      accurate.)    </p>    <h3>      3. Buy a car with how many miles?    </h3>    <p>      When a car goes over 100,000 miles, everyone assumes it's      roadkill; so the value plummets. This assumption was caused      by years of Detroit's planned-obsolescence      engineering-thankfully long since over-that caused      American cars to self-destruct at 70,000 miles. So snatch      them up when they hit the big one hundred.    </p>    <h3>      4. When should I sell the car?    </h3>    <p>      After years of learning the hard way, I arrived at the      150,000 mile mark as the safest time to sell. Of all the      vehicles I investigated, it seems Toyota four-wheel-drive      trucks are made to go the furthest. They are definitely      overbuilt. Their clutches, axles, brakes, transmissions,      wheel bearings, etc., are the same size as those of a      one-ton F-350 truck. The bad news is they cost more. The      other good news though is that they depreciate less:      250,000 miles is just middle age for a Toyota 4x4. This is      amazing to me, and to Milton. Milton is my favorite car      parts store worker. At age 75 he has seen lots of cars come      and go.    </p>    <h3>      5. How much should I pay for the car?    </h3>    <p>      Three thousand to four thousand dollars seems to be the      magic number for cars and small pickups. Add an extra grand      for minivans and two more on top of that for SUVs. Many      Toyotas, Hondas, and Mazdas fall into the $3,000 range when      they get five to seven years old. You need not limit      yourself exclusively to that price range, though, as almost      all cars seem to level out their depreciation decline at      five to seven years, and hold steady until 10 years or      150,000 miles.    </p>    <h3>      Cashing In    </h3>    <p>      In year one I bought a Toyota Corolla with about 75,000      miles on it and a Mazda 626 with 100,000 miles on it for      about $3,000 each, so my costs in year one were about the      same as if I had kept my new car payments. For the      following four years, the Toyota and Mazda cost me nothing,      not a single $250 per-month installment went down the      drain. Thus ...a savings of $24,000! At 155,000 miles, I      sold the Toyota for $1,650. When the 626 hit 170,000 miles      during the same year, I sold it for $1,850 to a mechanic      who's also a Mazda fan.    </p>    <p>      If I subtract the sale price from the purchase prices of      $3,000 each, the Mazda cost me $24 per month to own, the      Toyota a whopping $28. In addition, I saved significantly      on insurance because liability insurance costs half of what      the comprehensive coverage (which my former lender      required) removed from my pocket.    </p>    <p>      Since then I've done the same process over and over, with      two Accords, two Civics, four Toyota pickups, and a Toyota      Tercel. Some cost a little more, some a little less, but      the constant, interest burdened payments have ceased, never      to return.    </p><p>That started a whole new life adventure.</p>        <h3>      MY FAVORITE USED CAR LOT    </h3>    <p>      If you are anything like me, your head turns and your neck      cranes with every passing grand emporium of used wheels.      You scour used car ads and public auctions in search of the      hidden jewel. If all that fails, take a vacation to Paris      ...Arkansas. There, Shannon Wilkerson runs perhaps the best      lot in the country if some of your passions are used      Toyotas, Hondas, or Mazdas. I found him two years ago after      doing a national survey of who sells what, for how much,      and with what kind of profit margin.    </p>    <p>      I bought a 1987 Toyota 44 SR5 extended-cab pickup from him      for $4,400. It made my day because it was $1,500 under the      blue book wholesale price and $3,000 under the retail      price. My few hours on the phone and trip to Arkansas saved      me more than $2,000 in expenses before I even got out of      the lot.    </p>    <p>      Shannon is a big, good-natured guy, and with his brother      Gerald, owns a salvage yard and repair shop. He almost      never fails to have cars that perfectly fit my criteria,      and if he doesn't have them, he'll find them ...and sell      them below wholesale.    </p>    <p>      When I got to know Shannon, I told him about my vision of      getting out of debt-a vision that motivated me to do all      this research. I tried to impress him with my biblical      knowledge by quoting some scripture to back me up: "Where      there is no vision, the people perish." Proverbs 29:18, I      declared.<br />"Good try," he replied. "Around here, we      interpret that quote a little differently. Where there is      no fishin', the people perish."<br />I stand corrected.    </p>
