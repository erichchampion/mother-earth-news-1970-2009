                <p>      ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT    </p>    		    <hr />    <p>      <em>This and other solar system information is available      from Siemens Solar P. 0. Box 6932,<br />      Camarillo, CA 93011 ( http://www.siemenssolar.com ).</em>    </p>    <h3>      SOLAR AREA FACTOR MAP    </h3>        <p>      Please keep in mind that every solar installations is      unique and is affected by many factors, such as local      weather patterns, which vary greatly even within a small      geographical area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sizing Principles</strong>    </p>    <p>      In addition to the electricity used by appliances, the      system itself also consumes some power. For example: you do      not get back all the energy you put into a battery. Each      day a battery is left unused (and without any additional      charge), it can lose 1% to 2% of its charge, and even a      properly charged battery is still not 100% efficient. An      inverter also uses some energy to convert electricity from      DC to AC, and voltage is lost as electricity travels      through wires. To be on the safe side, system design should      assume 30% DC waste and 40% AC waste.    </p>    <p>      Solar modules should be installed at the correct      'tilt-angle' to achieve the best year-round performance.      Generally, this is an angle equal to the site's latitude      plus 20%, with modules facing south in the northern      latitudes and north in the southern latitudes.    </p>		    <h3>      BATTERIES    </h3>    <p>      Batteries are a major component in solar systems. A number      of different types and capacities are available. Many small      to medium sized systems can use photovoltaic or marine      grade batteries. These are designed to be deep-cycled      (discharged and recharged) many times and are generally      maintenance free. They are available in capacities of about      120 Amp-hrs.    </p>    <p>      Batteries must be able to store enough energy for daily      operations. A reserve should be considered so you will have      additional capacity to operate the loads during anticipated      periods of cloudy, sunless weather. This reserve capacity      is referred to as system 'autonomy' and is rated in clays.      The amount of autonomy needed varies. For critical loads      such as telecommunications, you may want 10 or more days of      autonomy, for a residence perhaps five days, and only a day      or two for a vacation cabin.    </p>
