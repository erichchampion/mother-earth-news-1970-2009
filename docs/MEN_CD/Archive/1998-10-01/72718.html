        	  		<p>COUNTRY VET</p>    		<p>		<strong>The truth about cats' and dogs' foods.</strong>		</p>		    <h5 id="byline">      By Andrew Martin, DVM    </h5>    <p>Like their owners, pets depend on a balanced diet for    their general health and well-being. But these days-with    store shelves brimming with dog and cat foods specially    formulated for every size, shape, and age, figuring out    what's best for your pet can be daunting. To help you sort    out what's healthful and what's hype, MOTHER turned for    advice to small animal veterinarian and emergency-clinic    owner Dr. Andrew Martin.</p><p>    <strong><strong>MOTHER:</strong></strong> <em>What is the    most common nutrition-related problem that you encounter in    your practice?</em></p>		<p><strong>Dr. Andrew Martin:</strong> Obesity. Most    household pets are, like most Americans, overweight. And the    things that contribute to added weight in people are usually    responsible for the same problem in their pets: snacking and    insufficient activity. Very rarely do we see a pet with a    gland problem causing increased weight.</p>		    		<p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Is there a good way to judge if    a pet is overweight?</em></p><p>    <strong><strong>A.M.:</strong></strong> In every household    pet, we should be able to easily feel the rib cage-not just    know that there are ribs there. In deep-chested breeds of    dogs, such as greyhounds, German shepherds, and setters, we    should also be able to see the individual ribs. In cats, the    main site of fat accumulation is the underbelly, which should    never get to the point where it sways as the cat walks. In    either case, the flatter the back of the animal gets, the    closer to true obesity the pet is approaching.</p><p>    <strong><strong>MOTHER:</strong></strong> <em>What health    risks are associated with obesity in pets?</em></p><p>    <strong>A.M.:</strong> The major health risks attributable to    excess weight in pets are the same as those seen in people:    heart disease and arthritis. The leading causes of death in    larger dogs are heart failure and euthanasia due to arthritic    pain. In overweight cats, there is also a very severe liver    disease that is quite common and often fatal.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER.:</strong> <em>What's the best way to keep a    pet from becoming obese?</em></p><p> <strong>A.M.:</strong> When    attempting to control or decrease the weight of your pet,    there is a lot to be gained from adjusting not only the type    of food it gets but also the amount. Diets that are marketed    for specific age or activity-level groups are generally    produced with either differences in vitamin and mineral    content designed to meet growth needs of young animals, or    altered caloric content designed to meet activity-level needs    of adult animals. If you cannot feel your dogs ribs, you need    to feed fewer calories-either by changing to a lower calorie    food or by feeding less in volume. And, of course, increased    activity can only help, if you have the resolve to do it.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>With so many foods on the    market, bow can a per owner choose the tight one?</em></p><p>    <strong>A.M.:</strong> The major pet food companies all have    veterinary nutritional experts on staff, who eliminate the    need for guesswork on the part of pet owners. The recent    explosion in the variety of pet foods unfortunately    complicates the decision making process. There are now    all-natural foods, foods with higher meat content than soy or    corn meal, lamb and rice varieties, high-protein foods, and    so on. Most of these foods are designed according to what the    marketing department folks think the public will be intrigued    into purchasing rather than any technical reason why they    would be better for your pet. And as for your local 'Super    Pet Store' that sells these products, it's most likely    staffed by part-time teenage help, rather than by anyone with    special training.</p><p> I would trust the expertise of the    professionals at Purina or Friskies over the advice of anyone    trying to sell me a product that I have never heard of. The    marketing personnel at some of the newer food manufacturing    companies have not been able to explain to me how a processed    poultry-based food can be more digestible than a processed    soybean or cornmeal product because it's not!</p><p> Let's face it,    the poultry or beef 'product' in a pet food is not any part    that a human would consume; it is simply processed to look    like liver, chicken breast, or chunks of beef to be more    marketable to you.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Of</em>    <em>the three main types of food-moist, semi-moist, and    dry-which do you recommend?</em></p><p> <strong>A.M.:</strong> I am    a strong proponent of feeding exclusively dry food to your    pet. The crunchiness is a major factor in warding off    gingivitis. Dry food is also healthier than moist or    semimoist because of the higher fat content of canned foods.</p><p>    However, animals, like people, find fattier foods tastier and    will generally prefer the canned foods. And as an extension    of this fact, most pets like human food even better.    Unfortunately, in addition to being higher in calories than    any pet food, most human diets are not anywhere near balanced    for your pet. Feeding anything more than the occasional treat    to your pet usually results in poor body condition as well    .as vitamin and mineral imbalances. This can lead to    irreversible growth abnormalities in rapidly growing puppies    (especially in large-breed dogs like rottweilers and Great    Danes) or to severe heart disease in cats.</p><p> But as a general    rule, as in human nutrition, just about anything is okay to    feed your pet in small amounts, provided a balanced food    composes the majority of the diet. This is assuming your pet    has no allergies or underlying medical conditions; in these    cases, consult your veterinarian. The professionals know how    to design the best diet, and pet owners should rely on them.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Is there truth to the rumored    connection between certain kinds of food and urinary disease    in cats?</em></p><p> <strong>A.M.:</strong> Many cats will form    crystals in their urine (similar to bladder stones in people)    if the magnesium content of their food is not limited.    Unfortunately, the production of these crystals is a    multifactorial process and the best advice that the experts    have for us so far is to use low-ash acidifying foods. Most    dry food varieties and all seafood varieties are very high in    ash and are to be avoided at all costs in cats with a    propensity to form crystals. While it might be considered    most cautious to avoid these foods in all cats right from the    start, there is far too much we do not know about the    formation of crystals to make such a general recommendation.</p><p>    <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Once we've figured out what to    feed our pets. the next question is when should we feed them?    Would you recommend free-feeding or set mealtimes?</em></p><p>    <strong>A.M.:</strong> Many pets will pace themselves and do    quite well if fed free-choice. However, creating distinct    mealtimes helps in housebreaking puppies, and it can be very    difficult to change to free choice with most young dogs, who    instinctively tend to gorge themselves-like many people I    know at a buffet! Most cats do well, but unfortunately many    owners will refill the bowl whenever it starts to get low,    rather than limiting the pet to a specific volume per day.    Fresh water should always be provided freechoice, the only    reasonable exception being the limiting of consumption near    bedtime while housebreaking puppies.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong>    <em>How can you tell if your dog or cat is not getting proper    nutrition, despite the fact that it may begetting enough    food?</em></p><p> <strong>A.M.:</strong> Any pet that is losing    weight while eating the same amount of food and maintaining a    steady activity level has a medical condition and should be    examined by a veterinarian as soon as the weight loss is    noticed. Parasitism, diabetes, kidney failure, and a variety    of intestinal maladies are all potential culprits. Likewise,    any dramatic increase in water consumption warrants a visit    to your vet.</p><p> <strong>MOTHER:</strong> <em>Finally, are food    allergies common among pets-and what are the telltale    signs to watch for?</em></p><p> <strong>A.M.:</strong> Food    allergies are almost always manifested by itchiness and are    always acquired rather than inherited. We do not see food    allergies that pets 'grow out of,' as may occur in people.    The best way to identify a food allergy is to avoid giving    your pet the potential offending substance to see if the    symptoms go away. This may take six to eight weeks on a    different diet, and many itchy pets will need medication in    the meantime to stay comfortable.</p><p> Unfortunately, most pets    with with an allergy to one substance invariably have    allergies to many others, and so these animals are quite    likely to eventually develop allergies to substances in the    new food. There does not appear to be any one pet food    ingredient that contains more potent allergenic substances    than any other.</p><p> I should also mention that there are many    more pets with inhalant allergies causing the same itchiness.    The current technology of using blood testing to    differentiate what a pet is allergic-to-food or    inhalant-seems to be only about 50% accurate.
