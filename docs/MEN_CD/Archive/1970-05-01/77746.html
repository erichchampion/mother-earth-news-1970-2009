        <p>Resort to ecological principles: MONEY DOES NOT EXIST. ONLY:<br /></p><p id="byline">Energy, perseverence and imagination are needed but these resources are limitless-unaffected by the laws of supply and demand.</p><p>So go ahead and DO IT.</p><p>Pay homage to the SUN-the original source of all your energy.</p><p>No one can tell you the WAY to build a dome or a zome or whatever.</p><p>CREATE.</p><p>You are your own architect. Work with what you have-ENERGY-and scrounge the rest.<br /><br />Play with models. Experiment. Use stiff cardboard cut into geometric shapes and taped.<br /><br />Get your energy going and the dome's SYNERGY will carry you.<br /><br />SCAVENGE AND SCROUNGE.<br /><br />As Amerika rots in its garbage, you can survive on the waste.<br /><br />Materials can be had from schools, construction projects, demolition sites, people, industry, lumber yards. Much is laying around dumped. Pig Amerika, in its greed, will give us our sustenance.<br /><br />From dead cars in junk yards you can get valuable metal tops, sometimes just for the effort.<br /><br />More information can be found in libraries and government documents. Check the Whole Earth Catalog.<br /><br />Ideas are free and the energy is there.<br /><br />Liberate YOUR ecosystem.<br /><br />Ecology begins with yourSELF.<br /><br /></p><p>We are at a college. A commune-Libre-visited here and turned us on. Now we have a 22 foot DOME added to our environment.</p><p>We got FREE: Tools, space, use of a station wagon, railroad ties, 2 by 4's, nails, fiber board, siding, paint, plastic skylight, money, and advice from a professor who built his own house.</p><p>We had no plans on how to build a dome in one hundred and seven easy steps-there are none. We did not know what we were doing when we started, but we learned a lot.<br /></p><p>It will all be useful again for our survival in the coming environmental crisis.</p><p>Return to your MOTHER EARTH and live in a dome. Get, for a dollar: DOME COOKBOOK.<br /><br />From: Lama Foundation<br />Box 422<br />Corrales<br />New Mexico 87048</p>
