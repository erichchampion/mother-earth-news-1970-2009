        Structural Insulated Panels, known as SIPs, are energy-efficientand easy to install for homebuilders working alone or in smallgroups. These factory-bonded sandwiches are made of foam insulationcovered by oriented strand board (OSB is made from thin wood chipsarranged in cross-oriented layers and glued into sheets. SIPs cando triple duty as the framing, insulation and sheathing of moststructures.<br /><br />There are three reasons SIPs are particularly good forbuilding:<br /><br /><ol><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><b>Simplicity:</b> SIPs eliminate the need for standardstick-frame construction. SIP wall sections can be raised andeasily nailed into place by one or two people. Panels are typically4 feet wide, and can be tipped into place one at a time onto asolid-wood bottom plate. On a calm day, 10-foot-tall panels can beraised by one person.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><b>Strength:</b> SIPs are three times stronger than similarstud-frame walls.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><b>Energy-efficiency:</b> SIPs can be 75 percent more energyefficient than typical walls in a stud-frame structure built tocode.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ol><br /><br />To learn more about using SIPs for your next building project,check out the Oct/Nov 2005 issue of <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i>.
