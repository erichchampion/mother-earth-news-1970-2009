        Today is Black Friday, the day when retailers can hope to get 'outof the red' and 'in the black,' as American consumers spend moremoney than on any other shopping day of the year.<br /><br />All this spending means Americans will end up with plenty of oldgadgets that need a new home. Today, one of the most importantenvironmental concerns is waste disposal. Because our electronictechnology is advancing at an extremely rapid pace, it is time toconsider what to do with our outmoded computers and otherelectronic devices.<br /><br />Some Alarming Numbers:<br /><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Every single year, Americans throw away 2 MILLION TONS ofelectronic products!</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Of the 2 million tons of e-waste, 50 MILLION computers and 130MILLION cell phones are tossed!</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>The federal government disposes of 10,000 computers everyweek!</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><br />Fortunately, effective solutions to the problem of e-waste arebeginning to emerge. Some states are hitting consumers where ithurts ? in the wallet ? to combat the problem. For example, inCalifornia it costs $6 to $10 to dispose of an e-waste item. Somecompanies, such as<a href="http://www.retrobox.com/rbwww/home/" target="_blank">Retrobox</a> aretaking advantage of the situation by selling discarded electronicmachinery, still in working condition, at bargain prices. You mayalso find a home for your functional electronic trash at<a href="http://www.freecycle.org" target="_blank">Freecycle</a> or<a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_blank">eBay</a>. Freecyclers trade usedgoods with one another in local communities, at no cost. Ebay usersoften auction their used electronics at great deals.
