                <p><strong>      HANDWORKS</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Ella Jean Earl    </h5>    <p><strong>      Learning a few of the basics can put you at peace with your      crowning glory. Plus, you'll be able to trim your family      budget.    </strong></p>        <p>      If you ever want to strike up a conversation, just mention      hairstyles and you're off to a long chat. After all, many      folks feel that hair is the very bane of their existence,      and yet few people are satisfied with their style. Those      with straight hair want curly and vice-versa; many will go      to extreme lengths to achieve what they "think" they want.      Almost everyone has an experience they can recall, often      interesting, sometimes incredulous.    </p>    <p>      For instance, I knew a girl in grade school who had long,      thick wavy hair which she absolutely hated. She wanted      silky straight hair, and she heard from someone that you      could iron the waves out. You can guess what she did next.      Yup, she took a regular flat iron to her hair and ended up      burning almost all of it. It was so bad that she had to cut      it above her ears and start growing it all over again.    </p>    <p>      I went about it in a completely different way. I rolled my      hair on soup cans to straighten it. I would cut the ends      out of used soup cans, wash them, and roll my waist length      mass of wavy, tight curls up in them. If you can picture      what I looked like you'll have yourself a good laugh, and      you can't imagine how difficult it was to fall asleep in      this state. Worst of all were rainy days. Whenever there      was a day with any rain or even humidity, my hair would      almost instantly frizz and my suffering would be all for      naught.    </p>    <p>      But it's years later now and I am more comfortable with my      hairstyle. I've learned which haircuts work best for me and      I've even learned how to cut my family's hair.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cutting and Styling Your Family's Hair</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cutting your children's hair is a great way to save money.      The cost of a child's haircut at a barbershop often costs      about the same as that of an adult. It can also be a real      nuisance to plan a trip to town for yourself or your child,      and many times you get to town and your child decides      he/she doesn't want a stranger to wield scissors around      his/her head. When you think about it, who can blame them?      Living out in the "sticks" as I do and having four kids, I      find that being the family barber is a great asset. Of      course I've made mistakes, but nothing that couldn't be      remedied.    </p>    <p>      With all the heads of hair I've encountered over the years,      it seems that regardless of the style, we're all looking      for the same thing-no-fuss hair. Keep in mind that      I'm talking about basic trims, nothing fancy. The most      important piece of advice I can give is this: Cut small      amounts at a time; remember, you can't put it back on your      head once it's been cut off. However, if you do cut too      much off the first few times, don't panic. It'll grow      out...and of course, there are always hats.    </p>    <h3>      Tools and Tricks of the Trade    </h3>    <p>      Things will go much more smoothly if you lay out everything      you need before you start. It's frustrating to have to go      looking for a comb when you're in the middle of cutting      hair-especially a child's. By the time you return,      the child will have either taken off for parts unknown or      given him or herself a new haircut.    </p>    <p>      Always start with damp or wet hair. This makes it easier to      handle, but keep in mind that hair becomes shorter after it      has dried. So be conscious of "the drying factor." As you      may know if you have curly or wavy hair, the drying factor      is even more extreme with curls, which become much shorter      when dry. So try to compensate for this before you start      snipping.    </p>    <p>      Invest in a pair of sharp scissors with rounded tips.      Trying to cut with dull shears is hopeless and results will      not be pleasant. Rounded tips are also safer when it comes      to cutting the hair of small chilren; too often they seem      to have ants in their pants, making it difficult for them      to sit still.    </p>    <p>      A good pair of hair clippers are a must for all types of      hair cutting and trimming. They are indispensable for      shaving the nape of the neck in order to give a short cut a      neatly finished look. They usually come with various      attachments or rakes for cutting hair to different lengths.      They also come in handy for shaving heads in the hot summer      months.    </p>    <h3>      Letâ€™s Get Cutting    </h3>    <p>      Place a towel or piece of sheeting around the neck of the      person's hair that you'll be cutting and secure it with a      pin. This will keep the clippings from getting down the      person's back, which can be extremely irritating.    </p>    <p>      <em>Short Hair</em><br />      Begin by wetting hair, keeping in mind the "drying factor."      Don't part the hair unless you want a bowl-type look. Take      small sections of hair at a time; work with strands of      about a half-inch wide and less than a quarter-inch thick.      If you try cutting large clumps of hair at a time, the cut      will looked unkempt, like you used a dull knife. Starting      at the front, use a comb to pull the first strand of hair      up and trim straight across. Take the next top section and      do the same; continue all the way past the crown of the      person's head, checking to make sure that the sections are      even with each other. To make the sides of your hair      "feather" (or layer), pull the hair up vertically with a      comb and cut. Continue doing this for each section on the      sides.    </p>    <p>      <em>Long Hair</em><br />      It has been said that if we could hang upside down and cut      our hair, it would be the perfect cut. Unfortunately this      is impossible and would result in uneven layers anyway. If      you have long hair and only need to trim the ends, wet your      hair and make an even, middle part starting at the top of      the head and going all the way back to the nape of the      neck. Bring the hair forward on each side, and comb out so      that it's perfectly smooth. Hold your head steady and cut      the shaggy ends off straight across. This will give you a      nicely curved look when your hair is combed back. If you      want it to be perfectly straight, you can line a ribbon up      against the bottom edges of hair trim straight across.    </p>    <p>      <em>Children's Hair</em><br />      Cutting a child's hair is often nerve-wracking. Most of the      time we treat children like adults and expect them to sit      quietly while we make them look tidy. Wake up and be      prepared for anything!    </p>    <p>      First, sit the child at a level where you can comfortably      reach his or her head;<br />      bending over to cut hair is a real pain in the back (and      neck). A high chair in front of a mirror works well. You're      probably best off letting the child watch what you're      doing. I've found that my children will look down while I'm      snipping-they seem to enjoy watching their hair fall.    </p>    <p>      Another good way set up a hair cutting session is to lay a      sheet on the floor and have the child sit in the middle of      it, admiring his or herself with a hand mirror while you      work around them. In any case, keep that child busy. Have      him or her collect the hair as it falls (later, they can      put it outside for birds, which use hair to build nests).      Don't hurry; be calm, patient, and choose a time when the      child is in a fairly cooperative mood.    </p>    <p>      One last important tip: If you're cutting bangs, be sure      the child isn't raising his or her eyebrows while you're      snipping-the bangs will be way too short and give the      child an unfortunate look of permanent surprise.    </p>    <p>      <em>Beards and Mustaches</em><br />      Anyone can achieve a nicely groomed beard and/or mustache,      as long as you take your time doing the trimming. Don't use      a sideburns trimmer, which will make your beard look (and      feel) bristled and prickly; use sharp scissors. Comb the      beard and sideburns down, and then, starting at the      sideburns, bring the hair out with a comb and trim off the      excess, making sure that the scissors fully close with each      cut. Continue; when you're done, the beard should feel      smooth and soft.    </p>    <p>      Be extra careful when trimming mustaches. I learned my      lesson the hard way. A friend arrived wanting me to trim      his mustache for him. As I was cutting, I accidentally      twisted the scissors in a way that a mustache hair got      caught. I didn't notice, and as I pulled the scissors away      from the mustache, I managed to pull the hair out by the      roots. Though there was no noticeable damage done, it hurt      my friend like heck. So hold the scissors properly, and cut      firmly and evenly.    </p>    <h3>      Take Care of Your Hair    </h3>    <p>      No matter how you wear your hair, it is important to keep      it shiny and manageable. Once you establish a hair-care      routine, your hair will be beautiful and you may even start      to feel at peace with it.    </p>    <p>      As for brushing, hair does not need the "100 strokes a day"      that our ancestors spoke of-25 to 30 strokes are      plenty to distribute the natural oils. Any more can damage      the roots.    </p>    <p>      There are three basic types of hair: normal, dry, and oily.      Each requires different care. You'll find shampoos and      conditioners available in the formula that is needed for      your hair type. Other than that, don't be fooled by all the      fancy advertisements promising you all sorts of      things-just use a good basic shampoo and conditioner      that is right for your hair.    </p>    <p>      <em>Shampoos & Conditioners</em><br />      The instructions on most shampoo bottles tell you to lather      and rinse your hair twice; this isn't necessary for regular      washings. One lathering should be plenty to clean your hair      without stripping your natural oils or drying out your      scalp. Do rinse your hair thoroughly with sparkling clear      water to be sure no soap residue left.    </p>    <p>      How often you shampoo depends on your hair type, how active      you are, and the environment in which you live. You should      always wash you hair after strenuous exercise or spending      time in the sun because of the increased amount of      perspiration. And shampoo your hair after exposing it to      chlorinated pool water or salt water, both of which can      damage hair.    </p>    <p>      As for conditioners, choose one for your specific type. If      you use the same conditioner for more than a month, your      hair can become immune to its formula and won't be as      effective as when you first started using it. You can avoid      this by choosing a different brand, because companies use      different formulas. The best way to do this is to purchase      three different brands that work well for you. Use one for      a month, then switch to a different one for the second      month, another for the third month, and then return to the      first brand.    </p>    <p>      <em>Normal Hair</em><br />      If your hair is "normal," you may choose to shampoo daily,      although this isn't necessary. Use a shampoo formulated for      normal hair, and use a separate conditioner about every      fourth shampooing.    </p>    <p>      <em>Oily Hair</em><br />      To keep oily hair looking great, shampoo every day. Avoid      shampoos that have any conditioner in them; they will leave      a greasy residue in oily hair.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dry Hair</em><br />      Choose a shampoo especially designed for dry hair,      preferably one with a conditioning agent in it. You'll      notice that many "dry" hair shampoos are also for damaged      hair. This is because dry hair tends to break and split      easily. Wash hair infrequently because soaps and detergents      strip hair of essential natural oils. Special conditioning      is vital to keep dry, flyaway hair under control and      manageable.    </p>    <p>      Here's a good once-a-month treatment: Put olive oil, baby      oil, or conditioner (start with the size of a quarter; add      more if necessary) into the palms of your hands. Run your      fingers down and through your hair, starting at the scalp.      Wrap your hair in a towel or plastic wrap and leave in for      about an hour or longer for extremely damaged hair. Rinse      thoroughly with warm water and lemon juice.    </p>    <h3>      Braids and French Braids    </h3>    <p>      Once the basics are mastered, most people find their own      way to braid comfortably. All braiding consists of is      crossing over hair, tightening, taking up the next section      of hair and continuing. (See bellow) Use coated rubber      bands, which are easier on your hair.    </p>    <p>      French braids are particularly elegant, and although the      process looks complicated, it's really quite simple. (See      bellow) As you braid, gather additional strands and add      them to the main braid-this results in graceful      draping on each side. The look of the drape will vary      considering how thin or thick the hair strands are.    </p>    <p>      Braids, plain or french, are the perfect hairstyle while      you're looking waiting for hair to grow out. It's also good      for young girl's hair because it will stay neat all day and      make the evening combing out process less painful.    </p>    <h3>      Hair Care Tips    </h3>    <p>      â€¢Mix vinegar and warm water to use as a rinse. This      gets rid of excess soap residue and keeps hair extra shiny.      Lemon juice adds golden highlights to hair.    </p>    <p>      â€¢Always treat wet hair gently. It is weak in this      state and can stretch and snap easily, which creates split      ends and fly-away hair. Use wide-toothed combs to minimize      breakage.    </p>    <p>      â€¢To untangle snarls, comb hair out starting at the      ends of the hair, working your way up. Knots at the nape of      the neck are particularly tough; be patient.<br />    </p>            <h3>      The French Braid    </h3>    <h3>      BONNIE GARDENER    </h3>    <p>      1. With your thumbs above and slightly behind your ears,      draw back and upward, gathering the hair that meets at the      crown into a ponytail. Do not bind with a rubber band.    </p>    <p>      2. Divide hair into three sections. Cross left strand over      the center strand so the two strands trade places, then the      right strand over the center so that those two strands      change places.    </p>    <p>      3. Hold the braid in your right hand, keeping the three      strands separated with your fingers. Place your left thumb      above and behind your left ear, and use it to draw a strand      of hair that is half as thick as one of the original      strands that's located in the braid.    </p>    <p>      4. Add newly gathered hair to the left strand and cross      this increased strand over the center strand, so that the      center strand is now to the left.    </p>    <p>      5. Hold the braid in your left hand, always keeping the      three strands separate. Place your right thumb above and      behind your right ear and use it to draw a strand half as      thick as one of the originals towards the ponytail.    </p>    <p>      6. Add the newly gathered hair to the right strand and      cross this increased strand over the center, so that the      center strand is to the right.    </p>    <p>      7. Continue to gather hair from the left and right, adding      it to the strands just before you cross them over the      center.    </p>    <p>      8. When there is no more loose hair to gather, switch to a      plain braid for the remaining hair and fasten with a coated      rubber band.<br />    </p>
