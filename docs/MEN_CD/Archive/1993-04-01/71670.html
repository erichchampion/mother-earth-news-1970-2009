                <p><strong>      GARDEN & YARD</strong>		</p>        <h3>      You can cultivate this beloved snack right in your      backyard.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      by Gail Damerow    </h5>        <p>      Sweet corn is terrific when eaten fresh, field corn is good      for feeding livestock, and Indian corn is great for      popping. Indian corn? That's right. Popcorn was one of      those fabulous foods that the Pilgrims learned about from      the Native Americans, who grew over 700 varieties with      kernels ranging in color from white to golden, red to      black, and all colors in between.    </p>    <p>      Archaeologists believe popcorn was the first corn ever      enjoyed by humans. Columbus "discovered" it when he landed      on the Caribbean island of San Salvador. Today, you can buy      gourmet popcorn left on the cob, packed in wine bottles, or      packaged for the microwave. As much fun as it is to eat,      popcorn is twice as much fun if you grow it yourself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Selecting Seed</strong>    </p>    <p>      Classified as <em>Zea mays,</em> corn is actually a grass.      Sweet corn is botanically known as <em>Zea mays</em>      rugosa. Popcorn is <em>Zea mays praecox</em> and comes in      over 100 different strains varying in flavor, tenderness,      presence, or absence of a hull, shape, and color. Despite      the wide selection and varied kernel colors, all corn is      white once it is popped. (Don't let the commercial cheese      fool you.)    </p>    <p>      The two most popular strains are "snowflake" and      "mushroom." Snowflake pops big and puffy and is the kind      you'll munch at the movies or pop at home; mushroom pops      small and round and is preferred by commercial makers of      caramel corn because it doesn't break as easily. You aren't      likely to find mushroom seeds for growing, but no matter.      Since you wouldn't process your homegrown corn by machine,      snowflake works fine. It's also the more tender of the two.    </p>    <p>      One of the first things that you'll have to decide when you      grow your own is whether to plant a hybrid or natural,      open-pollinated variety. If you plan to save your own seed      from year to year, choose one of the latter. Popular      open-pollinated varieties are Strawberry (which has small      ears with red kernels), Tom Thumb (a fast-growing dwarf      requiring little space), and Japanese Hulless (which has 4"      ears with kernels that pop quite tender). White Cloud, a      hybrid, produces fewer ears than open-pollinated varieties,      but many feel that it pops better.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Planting</strong>    </p>    <p>      Young corn shoots are highly susceptible to frost damage,      so plant seeds after all danger of frost has passed. Select      a sunny spot that's protected from the wind. Since corn      likes lots of nitrogen, it does well where a legume, such      as beans or peas, were grown the previous year. Seeds      germinate best after the soil has warmed to at least      60°F. Plant kernels ½" deep in spring; during      the heat of summer, plant seeds 2" deep. Germination occurs      in three to 12 days.    </p>    <p>      Plant rows 12" apart. Since good ear development depends on      good pollination, put in four or more adjacent rows. If you      don't have room for several rows, plant in hills.      Typically, only about 75% of the seeds germinate, so put      two kernels in each hole and space the holes 7" apart. Thin      later so that the best sprouts are 15" apart. For hills,      plant six kernels per hill, thinning to three after they      sprout. To avoid damaging roots of adjoining plants, thin      by cutting rather than pulling.    </p>    <p>      If you plan to save your own seed, isolate popcorn from      other kinds of corn (including other varieties of popcorn)      to avoid cross-pollination. You can isolate varieties by      planting them 500 feet apart or by staggering plantings so      stalks tassel at least two weeks apart. You should know,      too, that your popcorn patch can interfere with someone's      nearby sweet corn, so plant your corn where it won't start      neighborhood feuds.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Corn will only develop a full set of kernels if      pollination is complete. You can make sure this      happens.</em></strong>    </p>    		<h3>Cultivation</h3>    <p>      Since corn doesn't grow well in competition with weeds,      either keep weeds hoed back (taking care not to damage      tender corn roots) or mulch heavily. If rainfall doesn't      provide 1" of water per week, particularly when stalks      begin to tassel, water by flooding the ground rather than      by using overhead sprinklers; you don't want to wash away      the pollen. Apply compost or other nitrogen fertilizer when      sprouts are 6" high and again when they reach knee height.    </p>    <p>      Two enemy pests of corn are corn borers and earworms.      Borers attack stalks, kicking "sawdust" out through small      holes. If you find one at work, destroy it by squeezing the      stalk; otherwise, apply the biological pesticides rotenone      or <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> (BT). Earworms typically      attack ear tips when stalks begin to tassel. Deal with them      by sprinkling the tip of each ear with rotenone, BT, or      pyrethrin before silks wither and begin to brown. After      silks turn brown, apply a drop of mineral oil to the top of      each ear.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately there are two animals that love popcorn as      much as humans do: crows and raccoons. Crows go after young      sprouts-pulling them up as fast as they peep through      the soil to get at the sweet kernel below. One solution, of      course, is to put a scarecrow on the job. Another is to      mulch your corn patch so that, by the time sprouts poke      through the mulch, the seed kernels will have lost their      sweet appeal. If you plant in hills, a third crow deterrent      is to set up a tepee of three sticks at the center of each      hill.    </p>    <p>      Raccoons go after corn ears just as they're starting to      ripen. An electric fence will keep them out. Sprinkling a      little hot pepper on the silk of each ear will slow them      down. Turning a flood light on the corn patch, or piping      radio sounds to it, send the nocturnal raiders scurrying      for a more sensible garden. The Native American practice of      planting pumpkins among corn also discourages masked      bandits-some theorize that raccoons don't like the      prickly stems, others say the big pumpkin leaves prevent      them from looking around while they're busy munching fresh      ears. Who cares the reason, so long as it works.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pollination</strong>    </p>    <p>      Typically, one to two ears will grow on each corn stalk,      but they will develop a full set of kernels only if      pollination is complete. Every corn plant has both male and      female flowers. The male flowers are the tassels at the top      of the stalks. The female flowers are the ears. The silk on      the ears must be pollinated by the tassels in order for the      corn kernels to develop. Each pollinated strand of silk      represents one kernel on the cob.    </p>    <p>      To ensure good pollination, after tassels open to display      their yellow pollen, walk along on a calm morning and shake      stalks to make the tassels release their bounty. If you      prefer a more precise method, shake pollen from several      tassels into a bucket or large paper bag. Transfer the      pollen into an easier-to-handle smaller bag and sprinkle a      little onto each silky ear. Ensure complete pollination by      repeating the process on three different days.    </p>    <p>      If you plan to save seed to plant next year, but nearby      corn crops interfere with your own seed crop, protect ears      with waxed bags and hand-pollinate them. In his fine book      <em>Saving Seeds</em> (Storey Publishing; 1990), Marc      Rogers recommends this procedure for hand pollination: When      the tassels at the top of the plants develop pollen, cut      one off. Remove the bag from an ear and rub the tassel on      the silk. Continue on to other bagged ears until the tassel      runs low on pollen. Cut another tassel and continue until      all bagged ears have been pollinated.    </p>    <p>      After the silk turns brown, remove the bags and identify      the hand-pollinated ears by tying pieces of colorful yarn      around them so they won't accidentally get popped for      eating. Save at least a dozen ears in this manner, so      you'll have plenty of choice in selecting the best seed to      plant next year. Since corn kernels do not store well, grow      a fresh batch of seed each year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harvest</strong>    </p>    <p>      Leave corn drying on the stalks until the first hard frost      threatens. When frost approaches, or if the weather is too      damp, bring the ears of corn in and dry them under cover by      stripping back the husks and tying a few together in a      bunch. When the weather cooperates, dry ears right on the      stalks and pick them when the husks have partially dried      and turn brown. Kernels are ready for storage when they can      easily be twisted or rubbed from the cob.    </p>    <p>      Shelling popcorn can be hard on your hands. Most people      grasp a cob and twist the kernels loose. Those same people      complain about all of the blisters they got from doing      this. I find it easier to rub them off with my thumbs,      starting at the large end of the ear. Another trick is to      rub two ears against each other to break kernels loose from      the cobs. No matter which shelling method you prefer, toss      out immature kernels near the tip of the ear.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Popcorn Pow-Wow</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Native Americans developed many ingenious ways to pop      corn. One was to skewer an ear on a stick, roast it over an      open fire, and gather up kernels that flew away from the      flames. Another method was to clear away an area of soil      made hot by a fire, then toss on some kernels. A third      method was to heat a clay bowl lined with coarse sand, stir      kernels in when the sand got hot, and eat those that popped      to the surface.    </p>    <p>      Today corn is popped in an electric popper, in a heavy pan      on the stove, or in the microwave-with or without      oil. Dry-popped corn contains virtually no fat. Popped in      oil, each cup contains about one gram of fat. If you grew      up on corn popped in oil, as I did, dry-popped corn tastes      flat.    </p>    <p>      Despite all the corn popping appliances I've been given      over the years, I still prefer the stove-top method I      learned from my mother. I fondly remember how she used to      pop me a big bag of corn to enjoy at school. The popcorn      was great, but I soon grew tired of being mobbed by      classmates at recess. Mom also popped a batch every week      right before "Maverick" came on TV. One week she was busy      and forgot. When Maverick's theme song started, the whole      family turned in unison to ask, "Where's the popcorn?"    </p>    <p>      To pop corn on the stove, you need a heavy saucepan with a      loose fitting lid that lets steam escape. Heat the saucepan      on a burner and add ¼ cup of oil- preferably      one that's low in saturated fats, such as corn oil or      sunflower oil. (Don't add salt to the oil or your corn will      be tough.) Heat the oil to between 400°F and 460°F,      where corn pops best. Oil burns at 500°F. If it smokes,      it's too hot. Don't use butter-it will burn for sure.    </p>    <p>      Test the temperature of the oil by tossing in a few      kernels. The oil is ready when the kernels pop. Pour in      enough kernels to cover the bottom of the pan (if you add      more than one layer, the expanding corn will pop the lid      right off the pan). Two tablespoons of kernels make about      one quart of popcorn. Shake the pan to keep kernels from      burning and to coat each with oil. Your corn is done when      the explosive sounds peak.    </p>    <p>      Even though I love stove-top popcorn, I think the Native      Americans were onto something by popping it over an open      fire. Fireplace (or campfire) popping makes the tastiest      corn, although it also toasts you and wears out your      popping arm.    </p>    <p>      You'll need a long-handled metal basket, available at      old-fashioned hardware stores and modern fireplace      accessory boutiques. Put ¼ to 1/3 cup of kernels      into the basket. Hold the basket over the flame, high      enough so the kernels won't burn before they pop, and shake      the handle to keep the kernels moving inside the basket.      It's nice to have a partner who'll take turns while you      cool off and rest your arm.    </p>    <p>      If you can't find a long-handled popper, you can pop corn      over a campfire using heavy aluminum foil. Tear the foil      into 12" squares, one per serving. On each square, place      one teaspoon of oil and one tablespoon of kernels. Bring      the four corners of each square together at the center and      twist them to form a loosely sealed packet. Leave the      packets on a hot grill until the popping sound slows.    </p>    <p>      Corn can also be popped, Native American-style, right on      the cob-something like roasting a hot dog. Some      kernels will pop into the flames and be lost, some will pop      away from the fire, and some will stick to the cob. As      charming as it may be to pop corn this way, corn popped on      the cob is usually not as tender as corn popped off the      cob.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The Native Americans developed ingenious ways      to pop corn, such as roasting it over an open      fire.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Why It Pops</strong>    </p>    <p>      What makes corn pop? Popcorn kernels contain at least 14%      water. Under heat, the water expands into steam, causing      the starchy interior of the kernel to explode. When      moisture in the kernel falls below 12%, you get duds, old      maids, or spinsters-those unopened and partially      opened kernels that rattle your jawbone and crack your      teeth. Good popcorn should yield less than 2% spinsters.      Microwave popcorn is dryer than other corn and usually has      more spinsters than average. To avoid dried-out kernels,      store popcorn in an airtight jar or plastic bag in a cool      place. Avoid storing it in the refrigerator-the dry      air in a refrigerator causes kernels to dry out quickly.    </p>    <p>      If you get a batch of corn that's too dry to pop,      rejuvenate it by putting it into a jar and adding a little      water. Screw on the lid and shake the jar occasionally      until all of the water is absorbed. After two or three      days, pop a batch. If you still get too many duds, add a      little more water and try again.    </p>    <p>      As good as popcorn tastes, the surprising thing is that      it's also good for you. It consists chiefly of complex      carbohydrates. One cup contains only about 30 calories (add      another 100 if you drizzle butter on it). Among the      infamous food groups, popcorn qualifies as a cereal grain.      Thanks to its hulls, it contains about one gram of dietary      fiber. In fiber content, popcorn rivals bran flakes and      whole-wheat toast- but it's a whole lot more fun to      eat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pop-Happy</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since the proof of the popping is in the eating, it's no      wonder popcorn is so popular. Each of us pops down 60      quarts per year. Are you popping your fair share?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nacho-Cheese Popcorn</strong>    </p>    <p>      The American Popcorn Association (401 N. Michigan Avenue,      Chicago, IL 60611) distributes imaginative recipes from      Caramel Nut Crunch to Popcorn Peanut Soup. Here's one of my      favorites:    </p>    <p>      <em>1/3 cup cooking oil<br />      1/3 cup popping corn<br />      3 to 4 dried chilies<br />      3 tablespoons hot oil<br />      1 clove garlic, quartered<br />      1/3 cup Parmesan cheese<br />      1 teaspoon cumin seed<br />      1 teaspoon paprika<br />      ½ teaspoon salt</em>    </p>    <p>      In a small saucepan over low heat, warm oil, chilies,      garlic, and cumin seed for three minutes; strain. Pop corn      in three tablespoons of seasoned oil. Pour remaining oil      over popped corn and toss to season. Combine Parmesan,      paprika, and salt Toss with popped corn. Yield: 2½      quarts    </p>    <p>      <strong>Herbed Mustard Butter</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Popcorn Lover's Book</em> (Contemporary Books,      1983) by popcorn mavens Sue Spitler and Nao Hauser,      contains over unique 100 serving ideas. This 90-page book      includes seven different kinds of flavored butter recipes      such as this one:    </p>    <p>      <em>3 to 4 tablespoons butter<br />      1 teaspoon soy sauce<br />      1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br />      ¼ teaspoon lemon juice<br />      ¼ teaspoon dried rosemary leaves</em>    </p>    <p>      Melt butter in a small saucepan; stir in remaining      ingredients. Toss with popped corn. Yield: ¼ cup    </p>    <p>      <strong>Oriental Popcorn Mix</strong>    </p>    <p>      For this recipe, also from The Popcorn Lover's Book,      Spitler and Hauser recommend popping the corn in sesame oil      to give it a slightly nutty taste that goes well with soy      sauce and 5-spice powder.    </p>    <p>      <em>6 cups popped corn<br />      3 tablespoons butter/margarine<br />      5 ounces chow meim noodles<br />      1 tablespoon soy sauce<br />      1 cup cashews<br />      ½ teaspoon 5-spice powder</em>    </p>    <p>      In a large bowl, combine popped corn, chow mein noodles,      and cashews. In a small saucepan, melt butter and stir in      soy sauce and 5-spice powder. Toss with corn and noodles.
