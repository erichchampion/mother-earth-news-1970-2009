                <p><strong>      NATURAL HEALTH</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>      MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong>    </p>        <h3>      The "King of Health Foods" is alive...and making a      comeback.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>            <p>      <em><strong>Add a handful of sprouts to your favorite      vegetable dishes;<br />      they're a lot more healthful than using highfat      nuts-and<br />      tasty, too!</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Sprouts? Disgusting! You're turning the page at      record-breaking speed and who can blame you? An image of      tasteless vegetation emerging from your sandwich springs to      mind. Your favorite fast-food restaurant has probably      attempted to give your sandwich a "healthy" appearance,      forcing you to yell "Hold the sprouts!" before they throw      it on your tray. After all, only health-food fanatics can      faithfully consume this food with any enthusiasm, right?    </p>    <p>      Maybe not. In the health-conscious and low-fat nineties,      sprouts are making a subtle comeback-and with good      reason. They're rich in essential vitamins and minerals,      low in calories and fat, and high in dietary fiber. They      are also inexpensive, especially if you decide to grow your      own. Sprouts are a "live" food, and easy to grow indoors      during the winter months. Flavorful new varieties, such as      radish and onion sprouts, are now available (fresh or in      seed form) at your local grocery or health-food store,      causing the old alfalfa sprout to take a backseat.    </p>    <p>      So how did the sprout obtain its "King of Health Foods"      status? Every seed contains the embryo of a future plant      and the nutrients needed to nourish its growth. When the      seed (or bean) germinates, it releases these nutrients into      the resulting sprout. In the course of its sprouting, the      seed uses up some of its stored carbohydrates and fat, adds      water, and manufactures some vitamins and minerals. You      wind up with a reduced-calorie food that is still rich in      protein, containing more nutrients than the original seed.      For example, the vitamin C in both soybeans and gar-banzo      beans increases from a mere trace during sprouting, until      the soybean sprouts are as rich in vitamin C as tomatoes.      Wheat berries have three times more vitamin E and six times      more of some B vitamins after they've sprouted. They also      contain Super Oxide Dimutase, Dimutases are a class of      proteins having the common feature of being antioxidants,      which removepoisons from the body and aid the remission of      aging symptoms.    </p>    <h3>      Sprout Varieties    </h3>    <p>      <em>Beans (legumes)</em> : Mung, adzuki, lentil, soybeans,      garbanzo beans (chick peas), and Alaskan peas are the most      popular. It's sometimes a bit difficult to sprout the      larger beans such as pinto and kidney beans because the      larger the beans, the greater the chance of the beans      fermenting. They'll need to be rinsed often and stored in a      place not exceeding 80°F. Some sprouted legumes      (soybeans, chick peas, Alaskan peas) need to be blanched in      boiling water for a few minutes before eating in order to      destroy a protein-inhibiting enzyme called trypsin. Bean      sprouts can be cooked in your food, but add them towards      the end of the cooking.    </p>    <p>      <em>Grasses</em> : Alfalfa, radish, red clover, and onion      seed sprouts are a few favorites. These sprouts are better      eaten raw. Add spicy radish or onion sprouts to your      favorite coleslaw or potato salad recipe.    </p>    <p>      <em>Grains/Seeds</em> : Wheat berries, sunflower seeds,      millet, rye, barley, and sesame seeds are a few varieties.      Add wheat sprouts to your yeast breads to produce a      lighter, higher loaf. Try toasting wheat berries or      sunflower seeds for a nuttier taste. (Find toasting      directions on page 27.) Use them in or on top of muffins or      cookies instead of high-fat nut    </p>    <h3>      Buying Sprouts    </h3>    <p>      Your supermarket or health-food store may carry some      varieties of fresh sprouts plus seeds and beans for      sprouting. Since sprouts are highly perishable, market      sprouts are often past their peak. Don't purchase sprouts      in a produce section that's sprayed with water because wet      sprouts spoil easily. Ask the produce manager what the      delivery days are for sprouts. When you come to purchase      them on that day, you may have to ask someone to go in the      back to get them for you. (Don't expect them to love you      for this.) Sprouts should be dry, crisp, odor-free, and      without a "rusty" look.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Because sprouts are highly perishable, those found in      the market are<br />      often past their peak.</em>    </h3>    <p>      If you decide to grow your own sprouts, don't buy garden      seeds since these are usually treated with poisonous      fungicides. If seeds for sprouting aren't available, try      mail-order houses such as the following:    </p>    <p>      Walnut Acres<br />      Penns Creek, PA 17862<br />      (800)433-3998    </p>    <p>      Diamond K Enterprises<br />      RR # l, Box 30<br />      St. Charles, MN 55972    </p>    <h3>      Growing Your Own Sprouts    </h3>    <p>      As for equipment, you'll need a canning or large mayonnaise      jar, wide rubber band, and cheesecloth, or a sprouting kit      from the health food store.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step 1</em> : Rinse the measured amount of seeds or      beans through a strainer. Pour into a clean jar with four      times more lukewarm water than the amount of seeds. Store      upright in a dark warm place (but not over 85°F) such      as in a cupboard or under the kitchen sink. Remember to      place a "sprouts" sign on your refrigerator so you don't      forget they're there and wind up with rotten-smelling      sprouts a month from now.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step 2</em> : Drain the seeds thoroughly through the      screen by inverting the jar; when you're done, save the      water for soup or plants. Fill the jar with fresh lukewarm      water, swishing the seeds around the jar.    </p>    <p>      Repeat this process a few times, draining the water      completely. Seeds should be moist but not wet. Rotate the      jar so the seeds stick to the sides.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step 3</em> : Place the jar on its side and return it      to its dark, warm spot. Repeat the rinsing process,      preferably three to four times daily (a minimum of two      times). At least four times daily are recommended for      soybeans and chick peas. Within three to five days, the      seeds will grow sprouts. If any of the sprouts grow mold or      fuzz, discard them and save the rest.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step 4</em> : When sprouts are the desired length,      rinse and lay them on a dish towel in indirect sunlight for      a few hours in order to develop the green chlorophyll      (don't do this with beans and sunflower seeds).    </p>    <p>      <em>Step 5</em> : Store the sprouts in a covered plastic      container in the refrigerator for up to one week.    </p>		     <p><strong><em>Wheat berries have six times more of some B    vitamins after they've actually sprouted.</em></strong></p>    <p>      <strong>Adzuki Bean Nut Mix</strong><br />      I use this mix to sprinkle on top of salads or steamed      vegetables. It also makes a good snack food.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups toasted* adzuki bean sprouts<br />      1 cup toasted* sunflower sprouts<br />      ½ cup coarsely chopped peanuts<br />      1 clove garlic, minced or ½ teaspoon garlic      powder<br />      ½ teaspoon celery salt<br />      ½ teaspoon dried basil<br />      ½ teaspoon dried oregano<br />      1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan or<br />      Romano cheese<br />      dash cayenne pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      *To toast spouts:<br />      Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread sprouts on a large cookie      sheet and bake for approximately 15 minutes (five to eight      minutes for wheat sprouts). The sprouts should be slightly      crunchy but not dried out. Sprouts good for toasting      include: adzuki beans, mung beans, sunflower seeds, wheat      berries, and chick peas.    </p>        <p>      <strong><em>Sprinkle cumin or paprika on top of humus and      serve with pita spread.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sprouted Humus Spread</strong>    </p>    <p>      Humus is good for spreading on pita bread, crackers, or raw      vegetables.<br />      <em>1½ cups chick pea sprouts, blanched 2 medium      cloves garlic<br />      ½ cup parsley<br />      2 tablespoons olive oil<br />      2 tablespoons tahini (sesame paste)<br />      ¼ cup lemon juice<br />      ½ teaspoon tamari<br />      1 teaspoon honey or sugar<br />      ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper dash of paprika</em>    </p>    <p>      Fill a saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Pour in      chick pea sprouts and turn off stove. Let sit for five      minutes; drain. In a food processor or blender,      purée chick peas, garlic, and parsley. Add rest of      ingredients and blend. Serve sprinkled with paprika. This      will keep, if refrigerated in a plastic container, for      about four days.    </p>    <h3>      Quesadillas    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 large whole-wheat flour tortillas<br />      ½ teaspoon oil<br />      ¾ cup grated cheese (I use low-fat ched-dar)<br />      ½ roasted poblano or red pepper, sliced thin*<br />      ¼ cup wheat berry sprouts<br />      1 green onion, diced<br />      1 tomato, chopped chopped cilantro (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Place a non-stick 10-to-12 inch skillet containing a little      oil over medium high heat. Fry each tortilla a few seconds      on one side and remove. Place one tortilla back in the pan,      uncooked side down, and sprinkle cheese on cooked top.      Cover with other tortilla, uncooked side up. Fry 30 seconds      or so, flip over, and fry again. Remove top tortilla and      add peppers, sprouts, and green onion filling. Place second      tortilla on top again and slice quesadilla in quarters      (like a pie). Serve topped with tomatoes and cilantro, if      you have them.    </p>    <p>      *Roasted peppers: Cut peppers into quarters lengthwise and      remove seeds and stems. Arrange and flatten on a piece of      foil, with inside of pepper face down. Place in oven or      under broiler until blackened. Remove and fold foil over to      make a tight package; leave for at least 10 minutes. Peel      off blackened skin. Refrigerate in plastic container until      needed (will keep in refrigerator up to three days).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Crunchy Rice Salad</strong>    </p>    <p>      You might try using different varieties of rice. I use      1½ cups cooked brown rice and ½ cup wehani or      wild rice.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups cooked brown rice (works best if rice is cooked      at least one day before and refrigerated)<br />      1½ cups bean sprouts, or use a combination, such as      adzuki, mung, and lentil<br />      ½ cup water chestnuts, chopped or daikon      radish<br />      1 medium red or green pepper, chopped<br />      1½ cups broccoli, chopped<br />      1 cup green onion, finely chopped<br />      1 large stalk celery, finely chopped<br />      1 cup chopped parsley</em>    </p>    <p>      Dressing:<br />      <em>¼ cup sesame seeds<br />      2 medium cloves garlic, minced<br />      2 teaspoon ginger root, peeled and minced, or ½      teaspoon ground ginger 1/3 cup frozen orange juice      concentrate, thawed<br />      1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil<br />      1 tablespoon sesame or walnut oil<br />      2 tablespoons tamari (or soy sauce)<br />      1 tablespoon rice vinegar<br />      ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      ½ teaspoon sugar</em>    </p>    <p>      Toast sesame seeds in heated non-stick skillet for a minute      on medium-high heat. Stir frequently (don't let burn).      Whisk other ingredients together or place in blender to      mix. Toss together salad ingredients, dressing, and sesame      seeds. Chill and serve.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vegetable Stir-Fry</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you want to make this a meat dish, add one cup cooked      chicken breast after you sauté garlic.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons peanut or walnut oil<br />      3 garlic cloves, minced<br />      3 cups brown rice, cooked the day before<br />      1 tablespoon ginger root, peeled and minced<br />      2 tablespoons tamari (soy sauce)<br />      3 to 4 drops chili oil* or ½ teaspoon chili      sauce*<br />      2 cups broccoli or celery (steamed for five minutes),      chopped into small pieces<br />      l½ cups mung bean or adzuki bean sprouts (or a      combination of both)<br />      3 green onions, chopped</em>    </p>    <p>      In non-stick skillet, sauté garlic in oil over      medium-high heat. Stir in ginger; sauté for one      minute. Add rice, tamari, and chili oil. Cook for a few      minutes. Add broccoli and sprouts; cook two minutes,      stirring often. Broccoli should still be a bit crunchy and      bright green. Stir in green onions and cook for a few more      seconds.    </p>    <p>      *This is a very hot oil/sauce to be used sparingly. It can      be purchased in the oriental section of the grocery.    </p>
