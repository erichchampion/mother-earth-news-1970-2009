            		<p><strong>MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong></p>        <p>Rekindle one of the best meals of summer.</p>		<h5 id="byline">By Anne Vassal</h5>    		    <p>      <strong>O</strong> ver the years some of us have managed to      develop a fish phobia. Perhaps it's those childhood      memories of the lingering aroma of fish sticks that we were      forced to consume every Friday.<br />      Or what about the cooler full of huge, slimy, bulging eyed      fish that Uncle Fred used to bring back from his fishing      trips? And that smell-even the freshest fish leaves a      slight odor when prepared indoors.    </p>    <p>      Even if we cast our experiences aside, we might think that      fish is too time consuming in comparison to our usual      grilling fare of brats and burgers. We might also feel      compelled to comb cookbooks, searching for fancy sauces and      marinades to disguise the fishy flavor or dry texture. The      truth is, these are just fish stories. Fish actually      requires very little attention if you buy fresh steaks or      fillets and requires less grilling time than chicken or      burgers. As long as the fish isn't overcooked, it'll be      juicy and delicious with or without a marinade.    </p>    <p>      When it comes to nutritional benefits, fish has the brats      beat. Fish is far lower in fat than other meats, especially      the infamous saturated fat that is a major contributor to      heart disease. The fat that is present in the fish has the      famous omega-3 fatty acids which help to prevent blocked      arteries, and consequently heart disease. A study in the      Netherlands showed that eating fish only twice a week can      reduce the risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent. The      amount of omega-3 present in the fish depends on how fatty      the fish is (salmon is higher), and whether the fish was      farm raised, in which case the quality of the fish food      varies. The fattier fish (which are still at least 20      percent lower in fat than beef) also contain an antioxidant      called coenzyme Q, which is believed to be more effective      than vitamin E when it comes to lowering the bad guy LDL      cholesterol in your body.    </p>    <p>      Today folks must be casting aside those fish fears in favor      of the seafood because fish consumption is on the rise.      Still worried about that smell? For those of you men who      are the Macho King of the BBQ, fish may not have the same      prestige as a side of beef, but the neighbors will be      mighty impressed when you gracefully flip over a five-pound      lake trout. Think that you can't really sink your teeth      into a fish fillet? Try the meaty, steak like swordfish      shark or tuna steaks. Whatever your phobias, it's time to      fire up that grill for a delicious fish dinner. Here are      some tips to get you started.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fish and Vegetable Kabobs</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is a good family meal that goes well with corn on the      cob and a summer salad. Use a meaty fish that will stay on      the skewer. We've used mako shark, swordfish, monkfish, and      bass-depending on the sale of the week. Serves four.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 1/2 pounds firm-fleshed fish, skinned and cut into      1-1 1/4-inch chunks</em> <em><br />      2 medium summer sweet peppers (any color), seeded and cut      into chunks<br />      16 cherry tomatoes<br />      2 small medium summer squash (or yellow zucchini), sliced      in 1/3-1/2-inch circles</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marinade</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em> <em><br />      2 tablespoons dijon mustard<br />      1 tablespoon dry sherry<br />      1 tablespoon honey<br />      2 tablespoons lemon juice<br />      2 large garlic cloves, minced salt, pepper, dash cayenne      pepper<br />      4 skewers</em>    </p>    <p>      Whisk the marinade ingredients together. Put the fish and      vegetable chunks in a large bowl. Toss with the marinade.      Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes      to an hour. Prepare the charcoal grill. Skewer the fish and      vegetables. When the fire is ready, grill the kebabs about      three minutes per side, turning them so they don't burn in      one spot. Baste with a little of the remaining marinade.      Total cooking time will probably not exceed 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Whole Fennel Trout</strong>    </p>    <p>      You can also use whole (scaled) white fish. If a fresh      fennel bulb isn't available, stuff the cavities of the fish      with any garden herbs that you may have on hand. It's best      to use a fish rack when grilling a whole fish; an      inexpensive hamburger rack will work fine. Be sure rack is      clean and greased.    </p>    <p>      <em>4 whole trout (8-10 ounces each), cleaned<br />      4 tablespoons (or less) extra-virgin olive oil<br />      2 medium fennel bulbs with leaves</em><br />      6 large cloves garlic, peeled, sliced thin lengthwise<br />      2 lemons, cut into wedges<br />      salt, freshly ground pepper, cayenne pepper or paprika    </p>    <p>      Slice the stalks and leaves from the fennel, reserving the      leaves. Cut out the round core of the fennel bulb. Slice      1/4-inch slices across the bulb so it's cut into hollow      circles. Set aside. Simmer the garlic slices in the oil      until they're softened but not browned.    </p>    <p>      Pat the cleaned fish dry with paper towels inside and out.      Rub the cavities of the fish with lemon and place some of      the garlic slices inside. Rub the outside of the fish      thoroughly with oil, leaving some garlic and oil in the      skillet for the fennel slices. Finish stuffing the cavities      with chopped fennel leaves, saving some for garnishing the      finished dish. Place the fish on greased fish rack, side by      side. Top with whole fennel leaves.    </p>    <p>      While you're waiting for the coals, saute the fennel in the      skillet on medium-high heat until it's lightly browned and      tender. Place the fish rack on the grill. Grill four to      five minutes per side. Remove the fish and serve with      lemon, removing the crispy external fennel leaves. Sprinkle      the remainder of chopped leaves on fish and fennel.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ginger Salmon with Salad Greens</strong>    </p>    <p>      To save time, use some of the marinade for the dressing for      the salad greens. Serves two to three. <em>2 salmon steaks      or fillets (7-9 ounces each)<br /></em> <em>about 4 cups      mixed greens from the garden or a grocery mesclun mix (add      arugula or watercress for a more peppery taste)<br />      2 green onions, sliced diagonally, or 1 small red onion,      sliced into thin circles<br />      10 cherry tomatoes, halved, or homegrown tomatoes,      quartered</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marinade/Dressing</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 large garlic cloves, peeled and coarsely      chopped<br />      1</em> <em>tablespoon ginger root, peeled and grated<br />      1 teaspoon sugar<br />      2 tablespoons sesame oil (or canola oil)<br />      1 tablespoon tamari (soy sauce)<br />      2 tablespoons sherry vinegar (or white wine vinegar)<br />      2 tablespoons rice vinegar<br />      1 tablespoon lemon juice<br />      1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      freshly ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix all marinade ingredients well in a blender. Wash the      salmon in cold water and pat dry and place in a glass      casserole or pie plate. Pour only half the marinade over      the fish. Turn the fish so both sides are covered. Save the      rest of the marinade for the salad. Cover the fish with      plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.      Wash and dry the salad greens and prepare the salad without      the dressing. When the coals are medium hot, grill the      salmon for five minutes on each side (per inch of      thickness), basting with the marinade if necessary. Discard      any unused fish marinade. Toss the salad with the reserved      dressing and arrange on a large plate. Serve fish on top of      the salad.    </p>        <p>      Swordfish Stealcs With Herbs Any firm-fleshed fish steak      will work. Herb-pesto marinade will add flavor to      mild-flavored fish. <em>4 swordfish steaks, cut to about 1      inch thick for ease of grilling (about 1/2 pound</em>      <em>each. If they're large, you may want to cut them in      half)<br />      2 large cloves garlic, peeled<br />      1 cup fresh (curly) parsley<br />      1 teaspoon paprika<br />      1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      1 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander<br />      1 teaspoon ground cumin<br />      1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup lemon juice (or all lemon      juice)<br />      1/4 cup olive oil</em>    </p>    <p>      Rinse the fish in cold water and pat it dry. Place in a      large covered plastic bowl or dish. Chop the garlic,      cilantro, and parsley in a food processor (or mince by      hand). Blend in the rest of the ingredients so that the      marinade resembles a pesto. Smear the pesto on each side of      the fish and stack the steaks in the bowl. Cover and      refrigerate them for at least 30 minutes, but not more than      two hours. While you're waiting for medium-hot coals, place      the steaks on a platter. Spread the marinade on the steaks      and salt and pepper them. Grill four or five minutes per      side and transfer to a serving platter. Be sure not to      overcook them or they'll be dry. Serve with grilled      potatoes and a green salad.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fast Fish</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is for when you're in a "let's slap the fish on the      grill and throw on a few hot dogs for the kids" mood. This      works best with fish steaks that have a firm flesh.      <em>3-4 firm-fleshed fish steaks or fillets (tuna,      swordfish, shark, halibut, salmon, or even catfish)</em>      <em><br />      1 cup of your favorite bottled salsa (we use Arriba smoked      tomato salsa) or your homemade salsa<br />      2 tablespoons lime juice<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      chopped cilantro leaves (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Place the fish steaks in a shallow pan (like a glass pie      plate), patting them dry with a paper towel. Mix together      the salsa, lime juice, and ground pepper in a small bowl.      Spoon over the steaks, flip the steaks over, and spoon onto      the other side. Cover with plastic wrap and start the fire.      Grill the steaks when the fire is ready for about 10      minutes (5 minutes per side) an inch. Serve them      immediately, topped with cilantro.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grilling Tips</strong>    </p>    <p>      • A cold fish sticks to the grill, so remove the fish      from the refrigerator just before you start the fire.    </p>    <p>      • When you're preparing the coals, add some mesquite      or other wood chips to give the fish a distinct smoky      flavor. Soak the chips in water for at least 20 minutes      before using or add some at the start and again just before      removing the fish.    </p>    <p>      • Cook your fish on a medium fire, which means that      you can hold your hand six inches above the coals for three      or four seconds without screaming.    </p>    <p>      • To cover or not to cover? That depends. If you have      a Weber-style grill, you'll probably want to at least      partially cover anything that you grill so it will have a      smokier flavor. With fish it's best to only cover larger      fish steaks or a whole fish which takes longer to cook.    </p>    <p>      • Brush excess char off of the grill with a wire      brush, or clean a warm grill with wax paper. Let the grill      heat up, then brush it with olive oil, using a basting      brush or a new paint brush. The fish should sizzle when it      hits the grill.    </p>    <p>      • If you're grilling a whole fish, it's best to use a      rack so you can flip it over easily.    </p>    <p>      • If the fish are small, use a wire basket so they      don't fall into the inferno.    </p>    <p>      • Cook the fish approximately 10 minutes per inch at      the thickest part of the fish (5 minutes per side). Turn      the fish only once. Don't overcook, which will cause the      fish to be dry, but press the fish for frmness. Remove the      fish from the grill when it's slightly underdone, not      watery but still a bit translucent, because it will      continue to cook as it sits.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Selecting Fresh Fish</strong>    </p>    <p>      • A fish should smell like a fish without having a      strong, fishy odor. (Don't buy shark with an ammonia      smell.) Don't be afraid to ask the store clerk to let you      smell it.<br />      • If the fish is whole, look for clear, bright, intact      eyes; this alone isn't always a reliable sign.<br />      •If you're buying fillets, look for flesh that's shiny      and translucent instead of dull or dry.<br />      •Avoid buying fish early in the week. Ask the store      manager which days the fish is delivered.<br />      •Have the fish market scale, clean, or fllet the fish      for you.<br />      • Avoid buying fish packed in plastic. The fish should      be on ice since the colder temperature keeps it fresh      longer.<br />    </p>
