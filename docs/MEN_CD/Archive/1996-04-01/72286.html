            		<p><strong>SEASONS</strong></p>        <p><em>Brilliant Venus will actually cast shadows in May.</em>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Fred Schaaf</h5>        <p>      <strong>V</strong>enus is the brightest point of light in      the heavens. But this spectacular planet is fairly close to      the Sun in space and therefore always appears fairly close      to the Sun in our sky. We are lucky when Venus is visible      for more than an hour or two before sunrise or more than an      hour or two after sunset. And this spring we are luckiest      of all: in its eight-year cycle of recurring appearances,      this is the spring that Venus soars to its highest in the      evening sky. As April begins, the brilliant "evening star"      hangs halfway up the southwest sky at sunset and does not      itself sink below the horizon until about four hours later.    </p>    <p>      A bonus for Venus watchers occurs at the start of April. On      April 2 and 3, Venus is skimming right along the edge of      the loveliest of all star clusters, the Pleiades, or "Seven      Sisters," cluster. Although the cluster is usually easy to      see with the naked eye, the brilliance of Venus may so      overwhelm its stars that we'll need binoculars to spot them      plainly. The next few nights, no optical aid should be      required to view the wonderful little grouping of      sapphirelike stars being left behind by the peerless      diamond of Venus.    </p>    <p>      Venus is noticeably lower at sunset by early May, but to      make up for this, the planet gets even brighter. The      maximum brilliance of Venus is almost unbelievable,      especially as seen from a rural site, where Venus is even      capable of casting shadows in a very dark location. Try to      see how soon before sunset each day you can first glimpse      Venus. On days of deep-blue sky, the planet can even be      found in the middle of the day with the unaided eye!    </p>    <p>      The final weeks of May bring us the drama of Venus      appearing appreciably lower with each passing night. At the      start of May, Venus sets over three and a half hours after      the Sun, but by the end of the month, only about one hour      after. And if you have a small telescope or even a pair of      binoculars you can hold steady, there is another wonder of      Venus to behold: the changing phase of the planet. Venus is      a planet closer to the Sun than Earth is, and it displays      to us phases like the moon does (fully lit globe of Venus,      half-Venus, crescent Venus...). Of course, normally you      need a fairly good telescope to detect these phases. But in      May, Venus is approaching unusually close to Earth (not      dangerously close, don't worry!). So even binoculars may      show it as more of a long, skinny crescent than as the      simple point of light it looks like to the naked eye.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Total Lunar Eclipse for the Eastern U      .S.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Not since 1993 has the Earth experienced a total eclipse of      the Moon. On April 3, 1996, however, the Moon rises just in      time for the northeastern United States to see the start of      the total part of such an eclipse. In the southeastern      United States and across the Midwest, the Moon comes up      with the Earth's "umbra," or central shadow, already      completely covering the Moon. From the Rockies, viewers see      the umbra already moving off the Moon, and Pacific Coast      observers are left with only the slight stain of Earth's      outer shadow, the "penumbra," on the Moon when it rises.    </p>    <p>      The rising Moon often looks dimmer and more orange due to      haze down near the horizon. But as peo ple in the eastern      half of the country see this Full Moon of Wednesday April      3, get higher, they will know that the Moon is more      unusually darkened and colored. No one can predict exactly      how dark the Earth's shadow is in the different parts the      Moon goes through during an eclipse, or what colors are in      various parts of that shadow. But this eclipse will prob      ably be a moderately dark one, especially near the Moon's      northern edge around mid-eclipse-7:10 P.M. EST. The      sky won't be fully dark by then even in New England. But      the total portion of the eclipse doesn't end until 7:53      P.M. EST, and the last bit of umbra slides off the Moon at      8:59 P.M. EST.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, all of the United States will be suitably      positioned to see the entire total eclipse of the Moon we      will get on the evening of September 26, 1996. That eclipse      occurs at Harvest Moon and the planet Saturn will shine      beautifully at its brightest very near the dimmed and      reddened lunar disk.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Azaleas and Rhododendrons</strong>    </p>    <p>      While lunar eclipses bring added color to the night sky, we      don't have to look far to find hues of all kinds in the      birds and the flowers of April and May. Even regions whose      soil does not support many kinds of plant life still may      support a few unusual plants. For instance, if your soil is      naturally very acidic, perhaps because you live in or near      pine forests, then you should have little trouble growing      the fasci nating flow ering plants called azaleas and      rhododendrons.    </p>    <p>      The yellow blossomed for sythia also likes acidic soil, and      if you live in the northern United States you may see their      blooms linger through much of April. But May is the      greatest month of flowers in most of the United States and      it is then that many of the azaleas and rhododendrons reach      their peak.    </p>    <p>      The flowers on azalea bushes are trumpet-shaped and as such      a favorite feeding-place of hummingbirds. (Watch your      May-blooming azaleas for rubythroated hummingbirds hovering      and inserting their long tubelike beaks into the flowers      for nectar to help sustain them on their northward      migration.) The most common azalea colors are pink, purple,      and white, but further breeding has produced red, gold, and      orange. The blossom sizes range from small thimbles to      palm-filling bells.    </p>    <p>      The rhododendron is perhaps even more interesting, if no      more beautiful, than azaleas. Some "rhodies" blossom in      summer. Their most common colors are white and purple,      though again special breeding has produced other lovely      hues. The rhododendrons are clearly related to the      wild-growing mountain laurel, itself beautiful enough to be      honored as a state flower. But the most fascinating feature      of rhododendrons is the temperature behavior of their      leaves, which enables us to use them as natural      thermometers. The greater the angle of uplift in the      rhododendron leaves, the higher the temperature.    </p>    <p>      The leaves stay on the plant all year and it is quite      remarkable on the coldest winter days to see their long      forms closed up (looking almost like bean pods) and      pointing straight down. In winter, when you wake up in a      warm house, you can glance at the rhododendrons and      estimate whether the air outside is 30°F or 10°F.      In May and June, the lovely widespread flower clusters may      distract, but you can still notice just how chilly the dawn      is or see if the day is one of those throwbacks to early      spring which still creep in even when summer is at the      doorstep.    </p>    <p>      <strong>When Do We Hold Easter?</strong>    </p>    <p>      For the past 10 years, most Americans have made the clock      change from Standard to Daylight Saving Time on the first      Sunday in April-which this year happens to be Easter.    </p>    <p>      But what is the rule for when Easter occurs? Ideally, the      system for determining the date of Easter is as follows.      Take the date of the spring equinox (the start of spring).      Then find the first full moon either on or after that date.      Easter is the first Sunday after the day of that full moon.      (Easter can never occur on the day of a full moon.)    </p>    <p>      However, there can be departures from this ideal system.      For instance, church authorities decided to accept the date      of spring equinox as March 21. But, as astronomers tell us,      the equinox can actually fall on March 19, 20, or 21 in our      era of history, depending upon slight variations of Earth      in its orbit and upon leap years (for instance, this year      having a leap day at the end of February made the spring      equinox fall in the opening hours of March 20 for the      continental United States, and not on March 21 anywhere.).    </p>    <p>      In practice, therefore, the date of Easter is actually      determined by special formulas, such as the table of Golden      Numbers in the prayer book. When all is said and done, the      earliest that Easter can occur is March 22 (if the full      moon occurs on March 21 and March 21 is a Saturday) and the      latest Easter can occur is April 25 (if the full moon is on      March 20 and April 18 is a Sunday).    </p>    <p>      The last time Easter occurred on March 22 was in 1818; the      next time will not be until 2285! In the year 2009, Easter      will take place as early as March 23 for the first time      since 1913. The last time Easter occurred on April 25 was      1943, and the next time will be in 2038.    </p>
