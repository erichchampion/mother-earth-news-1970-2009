                    <p>      In the wake of the Great American Sugar Rip-off (or      shortage, if you will), I vowed-as many folks      probably did-that I'd never again support the      purveyors of granulated sucrose, but would instead try to      use natural sugar substitutes. Thus it was with a great      deal of interest that I read Mary Norwood's "Sweet      Sorghum!" in MOTHER NO. 35 (page 88), telling how to put up      homemade sorghum molasses.    </p>    <p>      By a happy coincidence, it was not long after I'd      discovered Mary's story in MOTHER that the National Park      Service-which manages the Natchez Trace Parkway in      this area-sponsored a demonstration of old-time      molasses-making at the Parkway headquarters here in Tupelo,      Mississippi.    </p>        <p>      For the demonstration, they used an authentic old sorghum      mill ... the genuine article, complete with a pair of mules      for power.    </p>    <p>      These ancient mills have become pretty scarce nowadays      (around here, anyway). I believe, however, that many of      MOTHER's readers could build a mill such as the one      demonstrated by the Park Service-or at least a      reasonable facsimile-if they set their minds to it.      The device seemed straightforward to me ... and I'm not      even mechanically inclined!    </p>    <p>      Although a housing blocked my view somewhat, the machine's      innards appeared to consist-basically-of two      metal wheels mounted horizontally in such a fashion that      they'd [1] turn against each other and [2] crush the cane      as it passed between them. One wheel was about eight inches      in diameter and the other approximately half that, though I      don't see how their relative sizes would make much      difference. (Any similar arrangement, I would think, ought      to work reasonably well.)    </p>    <p>      The evaporator pan the men were using was-like Mary      Norwood's-made of galvanized metal, but it was of the      multi-section variety (about seven feet long overall). The      section dividers consisted of narrow metal      plates-each a couple of inches wide-which had      been welded to the bottom of the pan. A two-inch gap      separated one end of each metal "fence" from the side of      the pan, and the dividers were staggered (so that the      two-inch gaps occurred at first one side, then the other,      of the tray), the net result being that the bubbling juice      could flow between compartments without any need for      ladling. Thus, two men were able to handle the entire      operation with relative ease and talk to onlookers at the      same time.    </p>        <p>      I was told that the yield was about one gallon of sorghum      molasses per each ten to fifteen gallons of juice-in      contrast to the 1:8 figure mentioned by Ms.      Norwood-but then, the Park Service people were making      a lot thicker product than Mary did. (The test for      "doneness" that the men used was to let a drop of syrup      fall an a board, and declare the batch ready only if the      drop formed a standing bead.)    </p>    <p>      One thing more: If you're planning to market your molasses,      you <em>might run</em> into a sticky situation where local      health authorities are concerned. Some inspectors are      really nit-picky ... particularly with regard to outdoor      food-making operations. (That's one of the reasons for the      recent decline in popularity of molasses-making in the      South.) Do your homework before you put your sweet sorghum      product on the market, and you'll avoid needless      disappointment.    </p>    <p>      Happy molasses-making!<br />    </p>
