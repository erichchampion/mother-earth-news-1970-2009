                    <h5 id="byline">   by BILL DURHAM    </h5>        <p>      Tired of that plastic-and-veneer imitation table in your      kitchen, den, dining room, or shop? Then replace it with      the real thing: a 100% natural, build-it-yourself "plain      pine table"!    </p>    <p>      It's sad, but true: a good "universal table" hasn't been      manufactured commercially for years. Today's furniture      market is glutted with drop-leaf, extension, Colonial,      Mediterranean, gateleg, and other credenzas, stands,      counters, desks, sideboards, etc. (which often feature      mortised joints and parts that've been machined from      expensive hardwoods) . . . when what the country really      <em>needs</em> is a low-cost, dependable Plain Pine Table.    </p>    <p>      There's little reason you can't make such tables yourself      and pocket a few bucks doing it. No matter where you live      in this country, you should be able to [1] build a PPT from      locally available discarded lumber, [2] sell the finished      product, and [3] realize at least a $25 profit per unit . .      . perhaps even $50 or more, if you exercise care both in      your selection of materials and in each table's final      assembly.    </p>        <p>      I started building PPT's because I had a surplus of three-      and four-foot lengths of lumber on hand (left over from      carpentry work and from salvaged packing crates). The      design I've come to use is simply something I picked up      through observation. (The <em>exact</em> design is      unimportant-any fairly adept third-grader can sketch      out plans for the kind of table we're talking      about--but you should strive to give your PPT's a      look of functional elegance by harmoniously proportioning      all the parts that go into each piece. Craftsmanship and      quality of materials are actually of secondary      significance, for if they're <em>too</em> high they tend to      conflict with the finished product's "plain jane" appeal.)    </p>    <p>      It's a good idea-if you want your tables to be      structurally sound-to use only seasoned wood in their      fabrication. This means that you should allow green or      found boards to dry indoors for six months. And don't be      afraid to feed any cupped or twisted planks to the shop      stove. (Out of all the pallet boards and packing-crate      planks I pick up, I expect to be able to use only about      one-tenth in my furniture projects.)    </p>    <p>      The only carpentry you'll need to know to build a PPT is      how to make right-angle saw cuts and do a little surface      planing. And the only fasteners you'll need are glue and      nails (you can forget about dovetailed joints). If a power      saw is available, the unit's legs can be given a most      pleasing taper. (All of the taper should be on the      inside-facing sides of the legs, however, to allow for the      tendency of softwood tables to go pigeon-toed.) The legs'      corners can then be chamfered with a pocketknife and plane.    </p>    <p>      Thanks to the availability of low-cost, reliable waterproof      glues, the wobbly legs and warped tops that once      characterized softwood tables can now be considered a thing      of the past. I find Water-mix Weldwood to be the best      all-around buy . . . but if you have a cheap source of      surplus epoxy, go ahead and use epoxy: it's a better      gapfiller than Weldwood.    </p>    <p>      Before I assemble a table, I pre-drill holes for my 8- or      10-penny finishing nails and clamp the pieces of the apron      to the legs while the glue between them sets.    </p>    <p>      A $75 table should have its top boards edge-fitted and      glued. If-on the other hand-you intend to ask      only $35 for your PPT, just make the unit strong and neat      and never mind the cracks.    </p>    <p>      Should you have an accumulation of boards which are too      short or too thin to use in a kitchen table, you might      consider the construction of typewriter tables.      Two-by-fours are not useful in kitchen-table construction      but <em>will</em> rip into perfectly proportioned      typing-table legs which taper from 1-5/8" on the top to      1-1/4" at the bottom. Make your stands 26" to 30" long by      18" to 20" wide, and 27" high for manual typewriters (an      inch or two shorter for electrics).    </p>    <p>      Do you have a supply of still shorter pieces of wood on      hand? Think about building Plain-Pine-Table television      stands which measure 18" in height, and 18" by 24" in width      and length.    </p>    <p>      You can upgrade your tables if you wish by giving them      drawers, puttied nail holes, and hand-rubbed finishes. I      build only plain carpentered tables-using a random      assortment of wood (soft pine, odorous pitchy pine,      off-color oak, unidentified packing lumber)-and      finish them with just some sealer and a little linseed oil.      Now and then, for variety's sake, I'll paint a few in      either medium blue, green, or brown.    </p>    <p>      A market exists for Plain Pine Tables of nearly any quality      of wood, craftsmanship, or finish. In fact, one of the      nicest things about making them is that a builder can find      his or her own level of competence or interest and price      his or her wares to suit.    </p>    <p>      Granted, the work at best only "pays wages" . . . but it      carries with it the feeling that one is meeting a genuine      need with a genuine product made of good, natural materials      which might otherwise go to waste.    </p>    <p>      The pine table is dead . . . long live the Plain Pine      Table!    </p>
