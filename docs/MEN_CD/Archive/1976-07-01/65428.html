                <p>      Looking for an exotic, flavorful, high-yield vegetable for      your late garden? John Krill has just what you want!    </p>            <p>      <em>Pe-tsai</em> (literally, "white vegetable") is nothing      new to the Chinese gardeners who've been growing the      delicious crop for close to 2,000 years. To American      gardeners, however, "Chinese cabbage" remains largely      unknown.    </p>    <p>      Which is a shame . . . because this heavy-yielding member      of the mustard family not only [A] grows rapidly in cool      fall weather and [B] shows remarkable pest resistance, but      [C] produces a head of distinctive, mild flavor . . . with      none of the stomach-upsetting qualities of the more      familiar European cabbage.    </p>    <p>      You'll recognize Chinese cabbage by its tall, columnar      head, which measures up to 20 inches long and 5 or more      inches in diameter. The tightly wrapped, albino leaves of      the head make a fine slaw and are excellent cooked or used      as a "surprise ingredient" in a tossed salad. In addition,      the long, thick-ribbed outer leaves of the head-which      resemble stalks of celery (hence the plant's alternate      name, "celery cabbage")-make tasty cottage cheese      boats and savory additions to soups and stews.    </p>    <p>      Chinese cabbage isn't at all hard to grow, provided you      satisfy the plant's few simple needs . . . the primary      requirement being cool <em>weather</em> for the greater      part of the vegetable's 70- to 80-day maturation period.      (It'll bolt and go to seed at the slightest hint of      summer-like weather.) Here in northeastern Ohio, we plant      our seeds in the first week of August . . . but then again,      in warmer regions-such as California-it might      be wise to hold off until September or October.    </p>    <p>      Seed houses offer two varieties of Chinese cabbage: Chihli      and Michihli. I plant only the Michihli variety,      because-in my experience-it heads more      dependably and more uniformly than the other type.    </p>    <p>      <em>Pe-tsai</em> seems to care little whether the earth it      grows in is clayey, silty, or sandy . . . so long as it's      rich in humus and/or manure. (As a general rule, if the      soil will support onions and tomatoes well, it'll do the      same for Chinese cabbage.) Before you sow your seeds, then,      spread manure or humus on the ground and till it in to a      depth of at least six inches. This procedure will not only      ensure that your plants have a rich supply of nutrients,      but will help the topsoil retain moisture (something your      cabbages need in great abundance if they're to enjoy rapid,      uninterrupted growth).    </p>    <p>      Once you've prepared the ground in this fashion, use the      corner of a hoe to make several inch-deep furrows spaced 20      inches apart . . . then water the furrows, sow the seed      sparsely in the wet trenches, and cover them with a half      inch of soil. In addition to showing where the seeds have      been planted, your furrows act to [A] keep water around the      seedlings' roots, and [B] concentrate the sun's warmth a      small amount. Both actions will help get the young plants      off to a faster start.    </p>    <p>      Let the seedlings come up four to five inches before you      thin them to stand a foot apart. If you intend to replant      the thinnings, don't just. pull them from dry soil (a      procedure which tends to damage tender root tissues).      Instead, soak the ground well first, <em>then</em> scoop      each young plant out of the ground in such a way as to keep      a good-sized ball of moist soil around its roots. Should      you choose not to save the uprooted plants, you      can-if you want-use their tender foliage in      salads or in cooking.    </p>    <p>      Once started, your cabbages <em>mustn't be allowed to      endure extended dry periods</em> . Drought conditions give      rise to short, loose heads with leaves that have a      decidedly strong taste and somewhat leathery texture. That      doesn't mean, however, that you should water the plants      constantly . . . just give them a good mulch (old manure is      particularly satisfactory) and see to it that the soil      never becomes parched.    </p>    <p>      Happily, few insects seem to relish the taste of a      vigorously growing Chinese cabbage. Bugs <em>do</em> chew      holes in the plant's outer leaves now and then, but these      leaves are destined to be torn off and discarded anyway.      All I can say is, <em>I've</em> never lost a crop of      Chinese cabbage to insects (and I <em>don't use</em>      insecticides, ever).    </p>    <p>      As your crop matures, pick the most mature heads first.      It's easy to identify fully ripened heads: simply reach      down and squeeze the plant in the center. If your fingers      meet with firm resistance consider the head "mature".    </p>    <p>      Don't panic if an unexpected frost should strike, for      Chinese cabbage can withstand a considerable amount of      cold. Even a plant that appears to be completely frozen      will be OK to use in salads and in cooking if you [1] strip      away all outer leaves, [2] place the bright, clean head in      a plastic bag, [3] put the bag in the refrigerator, and [4]      let the frozen foilage thaw overnight. The next day, your      cabbage will look-and taste-as though nothing      had happened to it.    </p>    <p>      Chinese cabbage can be stored in several ways. The easiest      way is just to pack the heads in the fridge's crisper . . .      however, if you wish to store cabbages for more than a      couple of weeks (or if you have a whole garden full of      heads that need to come indoors), you'd best stash the crop      in the cold cellar. Uproot each plant, discard the outer      leaves, arrange the cabbages in rows with dry straw laid in      between them . . . and your crop will keep for two months      or more.    </p>    <p>      You can also keep Chinese cabbages growing indoors until      you want them by placing the plants in tubs or deep      containers so that the roots'll stand in water. (Don't      shake off any soil that adheres to the roots.)    </p>    <p>      If you're looking for a rewarding (in more ways than one)      fall crop, consider pe-tsai. It's "the cabbage with a      difference".    </p>
