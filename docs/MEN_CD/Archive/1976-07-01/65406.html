                <p>      Determining how much water I had in my water tank used to      be a real chore (what with having to climb the tower in      order to peer through the tank's manhole) ... until I      devised a painless-yet accurate-way to check      the container's water level while I stood on the ground.    </p>    <p>      The answer? A simple sight gauge which uses the compression      of air in a length of clear plastic tubing as an indication      of water pressure ... which-in turn-is nothing but a ref      lection of the tank's water capacity.    </p>    <p>      The accompanying drawings will give you an idea of how the      system is set up. As you can see, there's nothing complex      about the gauge's construction (I built mine in two hours      at a total parts cost of less than ten dollars ... and I'm      sure you can do the same). About the only slightly thorny      part of the whole project is the calibration of the      sight-tube ... and even that's a snap when you know how.    </p>        <p>      [1] First of all-with the plug (Part 1) removed from      the top of the transparent plastic tube-open the      shut-off valve (Part 2) just a crack, until the water level      is visible near the bottom of the sight gauge. Close the      valve, replace the plug, and tighten the top hosing clamp      until air will no longer escape past the end plug. (Hint:      Some air loss is virtually inevitable, but you can cut that      loss to an absolute minimum by giving the tubing plug a      light coat of very thick grease prior to installing it for      the last time.)    </p>    <p>      [2] Drain the tank ... but not the service pipe. Now open      the shut-off valve and you'll see the water level rise in      the plastic tube as a result of the head pressure created      by the water remaining in the service pipe. Mark the      position of the meniscus, or water level, on the plywood      backboard and label this spot "TANK EMPTY". (Leave the      shut-off valve open from now on.)    </p>    <p>      [3] Next, fill the water tank brim full. Then mark the      position of the meniscus on the backboard and label the      spot "TANK FULL".    </p>    <p>      [4] Find the midpoint between the "TANK FULL" and "TANK      EMPTY" lines and mark this locus -1/2 FULL". Make as many      other subdivisions of the scale as you feel necessary.      That's all!    </p>    <p>      The usefulness of this gauge is not limited to water tank      systems alone. It can also be used to measure city water      pressure, and-by acting as a pressure-overload      damper-can even cure water hammer problems.    </p>    <p>      In addition, if you have your own water pump, the makeshift      pressure indicator can help you detect pump failures, line      breaks, or even a drop in the water table (should this      affect your pump's pressure output).    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by JIM AMDAL    </h5>        <p>      In MOTHER NO. 39, Richard Hilton told you how to erect your      own backyar water tower. Above, Jim Amdal explains a method      that will allow you to measure-easily and      accurately-the amount of water that your big elevated      storage tank contains. The project, says Jim, should cost      you no more than $10 and two hours.    </p>
