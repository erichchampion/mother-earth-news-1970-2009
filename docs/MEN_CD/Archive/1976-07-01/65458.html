                    <h5 id="byline">      by Gail E. Johnson    </h5>        <p>      Should you acquire an old dresser with ornate cast-iron      handles that beg not to be replaced, don't-whatever      you do-throw away the ancient pulls just because one      of their mates is broken or missing. Check around at      antique shops first, and if that doesn't turn up a suitable      replacement (it probably won't), consider casting your own.      It's not as hard to do as you might think.    </p>    <p>      First find a small, flat container that's just large enough      to hold one of your undamaged handles.    </p>    <p>      Second, buy some <em>water putty</em> at a hardware store      (just ask for it . . . they'll know what you want)      and-following the directions on the box-mix      enough putty to support (not immerse) one of the good pulls      in the little flat container.    </p>    <p>      Now apply a thin coat of oil to an undamaged pull (so that      it won't stick later on), place it face down in the putty,      and go away for a while.    </p>    <p>      After the putty has dried completely, very carefully remove      the pull (use a pointed instrument if you have to to help      you pry the handle from the mold). Try not to damage the      hardened putty.    </p>    <p>      Next-with the aid of a propane torch-heat a      small quantity of white metal (which you can get at any      auto-wrecking establishment) in a metal crucible spoon      (usually obtainable from a plumbing supply house). Once the      white metal has melted, <em>carefully</em> pour it into the      water-putty mold, and allow it to cool. Finally, break the      putty from the casting.    </p>    <p>      At this point, all you have to do is [1] file off any rough      edges which the new pull might have and [2] spray paint all      the handles to match each other . . . and you've got a      good-as-new set of drawer pulls!    </p>
