                    <p>      AERIAL SPRAYING OF THE PESTICIDE ENDRIN against cutworms in      south-central Kansas has resulted in illness among some      local residents, and the deaths of cattle, horses, dogs,      and more than two million fish in area lakes, ponds, and      streams. Failure to turn spray machines off at critical      times-and "drift" of the compound due to application      on windy days-were cited as "probable causes". One      dairy farmer in the region was forced to dump his herd's      milk production for five consecutive days due to      contamination, and others are now concerned that pasture      and forage may be tainted by the man-made poison,    </p>    <p>      DID YOU KNOW THAT A NATIONWIDE RETURNABLE-BOTTLE SYSTEM      would save 115,000 barrels of oil a day ... that 73% of the      people in this country favor such a plan ... and that as      much as 56% of what you pay when you buy a beer or soft      drink is for the container? These facts and more on energy,      solid waste, materials, litter, employment, and consumer      issues related to the throwaway-bottle controversy are      presented in <em>Bottles and Sense,</em> a 20-page      publication by the Environmental Action Foundation. Copies      are available from EAF (724 Dupont Circle Building,      Washington, D.C. 20036) for $1.00 each.    </p>    <p>      THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS HIDDEN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS in new      currency in a vault inside Pony Mountain near Culpeper,      Virginia, The seven-million-dollar facility-which is      also designed to accommodate 400 people, and costs      approximately $1.8 million a year to guard and      maintain-holds the "cache of cash" as a hedge against      any nuclear attack that might wipe out the nation's money      supply. But, as Senator William Proxmire has wryly pointed      out, a more probable end to the doomsday plan might be that      "we would have money and no people except for a few lonely      radioactive government officials".    </p>    <p>      FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE Lewis Parker      has ruled that Seattle-area manufacturers do not have to      label the "native" Alaskan curios they sell as "machine      made in Seattle". According to that city's      <em>Post-Intelligencer</em> , the judge commented that      "many products which the consumer purchases are not what      they appear to be" and that 'revealing the whole truth      would do away with unfounded assumptions which consumers      might have".    </p>    <p>      DUBIOUS HONOR OF BECOMING FIRST TWO INSECTS listed as      "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act has been      bestowed upon two varieties of butterflies: theSchaus      swallowtail and Bahama swallowtail. Keith M. Schreiner,      Associate Director of the Interior Department's U.S. Fish      and Wildlife Service says the event is "particularly      disturbing because the real name of the game in endangered      species is the conservation of ecosystems, and some of the      best indicators of the health of an ecosystem are insects".    </p>    <p>      $250 CASH REWARD GOES TO ANY GARDENER WHO can somehow      manage to top one of the following current world's records      for largest vegetables: tomato (4 lb., 4 oz.), watermelon      (197 lb.), squash (378 lb.), and sunflower (21', 5-1/2").      Prize money is offered by Grace's Gardens (Autumn Lane,      Hackettstown, N.J. 07840), which specializes in selling      seed for rare and gigantic garden crops, and calls its      catalog (available for 25 cents ) "the world's most      unusual". After reading the brochure's 16 pages full of      such items as yard-long beans, 12-foot-high corn, and      65-inch-long banana squash, we can only agree.    </p>    <p>      NATION'S CAPITAL FACING YET ANOTHER CRITICAL PROBLEM as      demand for fresh water-which was estimated at 381      million gallons a day in 1970-increases steadily, and      is expected to rise to 600 million gallons a day by 1980.      The city's only source of supply, the Potomac River,      sometimes flows at a rate of just 400 million gallons per      24 hours during annual dry spells ... and strip mining      operations are poisoning stretches of the river upstream      with acid wastes. Meanwhile, effluents from the metropolis      itself continue to cause severe pollution south of the      city, where the Potomac empties into Chesapeake Bay,    </p>    <p>      THIS YEAR, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II, more than      half of all U.S. households (as many as 100 million      people!) will tend some kind of vegetable plot. And an even      more encouraging indication of the country's burgeoning      grow-it-yourself movement is the dramatic increase in      community gardens. Two years ago, there were only 500 such      facilities ... and today, the number of large tracts of      land portioned off and shared by "backyard sodbusters" is      <em>conservatively</em> estimated at 5,000!    </p>    <p>      YOU CAN TURN YOUR BACKYARD INTO A MINIATURE WILDLIFE REFUGE      -and get public recognition for doing so by      participating in a program sponsored by the National      Wildlife Federation to encourage widespread conservation.      If you're 13 years of age or older-and live on      property (three acres or less) which meets the NWF's      requirements for animal habitat-the organization will      "certify" your land as a wildlife refuge and send a press      release to local newspapers announcing their official      appreciation of your ecological efforts. For more      information, write the Federation at 1412 16th St. N.W.,      Washington, D.C. 20036.    </p>    <p>      "WORK TECHNIQUE FOR THE OCCASIONAL CHAIN SAW USER" -a      sixteen-page color booklet described as a "mini-course in      woodcutting"-includes instructions for handling,      servicing, and using the machines to fell, limb, and buck      nearly any size tree. The publication is available for the      asking from Husqvarna, Inc., 151 New World Way, South      Plainfield, N.J. 07080.    </p>    <p>      THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES THAT 75% TO 85% OF      ALL CANCER in humans is caused by manmade substances      introduced into our environment ... and, according to Dr.      Sheldon Margen -professor of human nutrition at the      University of California at Berkeley-much of that      percentage can be attributed to food additives. The good      doctor says that more than 3,000 chemicals are now used in      this country as artificial flavorings, and of that number      "less than 1% have been examined for toxicity".    </p>
