        Many people have found that it is more difficult to peel farm-freshhard-boiled eggs than to peel hard-boiled eggs from the grocerystore. Don Schrider of the<a href="http://www.albc-usa.org" target="_blank">American Livestock BreedsConservancy</a> offers this helpful tip: Boil the egg, drain thewater from the pan, put the lid back on and give the pan a fewshakes as if you were making popcorn (forward and back, as well asa little up and down). Next, add cold water to cover the eggs, letsit for one or two minutes, drain and peel. At this point, theyshould peel easily. Also, eggs that are seven to 10 days old willpeel easier after boiling than very fresh eggs.
