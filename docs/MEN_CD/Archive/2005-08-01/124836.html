        <p><br /> For over 35 years, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> has been teachingreaders the basics of homesteading and how to be self-reliant.Whether you dream of creating an urban or suburban homestead, or arural farmstead, these practical skills, tools and home businessideas will help you move 'forward to the land.'</p><br /><p>Americans are the epitome of self-sufficiency and self-reliance.From the country's beginning in the 1600s, American settlers,pioneers, homesteaders, back-to-the-landers and farmers have reliedon their ingenuity and creativity to live well on less, engagingtheir rural communities in the process.</p><br /><p>Homesteading may be an old-fashioned word, but the concepts ofself-sufficient living; building a home (not just a house); anddeveloping a home business are as appealing today as they were inthe Homesteading days of the late 1800s. We, as a people, havealways been inspired by the Laura Ingalls Wilder family, DanielBoone, Henry David Thoreau, Joseph Smith, Helen and Scott Nearing,Carla Emery and Eliot Coleman. Through their writings onself-sufficiency and how to do things yourself, they have inspiredthousands of people to give the notion of homesteading, ruralliving or farm life a try. They have shared with us their successesand failures and the joys and sorrows of the adventure. Theirreports on building barns and outbuildings, tool usage and startinga home business are the modern homesteading Bibles. We admire andenvy their ability to be self-sufficient.</p><br /><br /><h3 align="center">INSPIRING HOMESTEADERS</h3><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>Mother Made Me Do It</i> by Jim Schley,<i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> October/November 2003</h4><br /><p>In the late 1960s and early 70s, countless Americans in searchof a hands-on, homemade life headed off the beaten track to findland of their own. In some areas these back-to-the-landersattempted to resuscitate rural communities and local economies withnew approaches to agriculture and the revival of artisan crafts andold-time skills.<br /><br /> In 1975, Jim Schley moved from Wisconsin to rural New England toattend college. In the long Connecticut River Valley that forms theborder between New Hampshire and Vermont, he found a place to sinkhis own roots: a gorgeous, water-lush land of conifer forests,dramatically distinct seasons, and strong traditions of subsistencefarming and logging.<br /><br /> During this time, Jim met scores of people who had built their ownhouses and who grew most of their own food. Some had dowsed andthen dug their own wells. Many had milled lumber for their homesfrom trees that were hauled out of the forests by horses. And someproduced their household electricity with small hydro-turbines,wind spinners or solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Even though manyof these folks were former suburbanites, their energetic creativitymeshed well with the longtime regional traditions of homesteading:seasonal cycles of work; hunting and foraging; cutting wood in thewinter; sugaring in the spring; and growing and preserving fruitand vegetables.</p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2003_October_November/Mother_Made_Me_Do_It">READ THE FULL STORY</a></div><br /><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>The New Pioneers</i> by David Gumpert,<i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> September/October 1971<br /><br /></h4><br /><p>When Sue and Eliot Coleman sit down to eat in their tinyone-room house, they use tree stumps instead of chairs. When theyneed drinking water, Sue walks a quarter of a mile through thewoods to a freshwater brook and hauls back two big containershanging from a yoke over her shoulders. And when the Colemans wantto read at night, they light kerosene lanterns.</p><br /><p>The young couple - Sue is 26, Eliot 31- aren't the forgottenvictims of rural poverty or some natural disaster. They live asthey do out of choice. They have deliberately given up suchluxuries as indoor plumbing, store-bought furniture and everythingthat electricity makes possible. They have no telephone, noautomatic mixer, no TV set.</p><br /><p>With their two-year-old daughter, Melissa, Sue and Eliot aretrying to escape America's consumer economy and live in thewilderness much as the country's pioneers did. They grow about 80%of their own food and spend only about $2,000 a year on things theycan't make themselves.</p><br /><p>The Colemans have been living this way two and a half years andthey're proud of their accomplishment. 'If you listen to MadisonAvenue, we don't exist,' says Eliot. 'They say it's impossible tolive on $2,000.'</p><br /><p>The Colemans are among a tiny but apparently growing number ofyoung couples, often from middle-class families, who are taking upthe pioneering life, or 'homesteading' as it's often called -though today's pioneers usually can't get free land from thegovernment as early homesteaders did. Favorite homesteading areasare New England, the Pacific Northwest, the Ozarks and Canada. Sueand Eliot have 40 acres of thick forest 30 miles south of a smalltown near the central Maine coast.</p><br /><p>The Colemans say they personally know about a dozen couples whoare taking up homesteading. A neighbor of the Colemans, HelenNearing, 67, who with her husband, Scott, now 87, retreated to ahomestead in Vermont in the early 1930s and later moved to Maine,says 'a lot of people, more than 100, are getting land and livingoff of it.'</p><br /><p align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/1971_September_October/The_New_Pioneers">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /><br /></p><br /><div align="center"><br /><h2><a name="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Planning" id="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Planning"></a>Homesteading andSelf-reliance: Planning Your Homestead</h2><br /><div align="left">The following are 'reports from the field' onplanning for homesteading and self-sufficiency, written by men andwomen who dreamed of being self-sufficient and living in harmonywith the natural world. These folks emulated the self-reliantpioneering spirit of our ancestors who homesteaded on the plains ofKansas, at the foothills of the Rockies and in the Californiamining camps. Whether you want to homestead on rural, urban orsuburban land, or just want to become more self-reliant in yourcurrent home, the examples of self-sufficiency and homesteadingefforts in the following stories will inspire you to begin planningnow.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h4>Adapted from <i>Finding Your Place</i> by the <i>Mother EarthNews</i> Editors, December/January 2003</h4><br /><p>Finding the right place to homestead, farm or develop aself-sustaining life usually begins with finding the rightproperty; only you know what is the best place for your family.Whether it's an acreage hidden in the hills or a townhouse in themiddle of a bustling city center, most of us are searching for aspecial place we can call home.</p><br /><p align="center"><i>The following advice is based on 24house-buying and property-purchasing escapades.</i></p><br /><p>We devote immeasurable hours imagining what we want, but may notknow exactly how to find it and buy it. When a perfect Craftsmanbungalow or spring-fed five acres finally does appear, we need allthe advice we can get about how to make the wisest possiblepurchase. After all, buying a house or land is certainly one of thebiggest single expenditures most of us will ever make. And onceyou've bought it, there are no refunds or exchanges. It only makessense to be cautious and know as much as possible before youbuy.</p><br /><p>First, forget the Joneses and hone in on what you want - andwhat you can afford. Be realistic and you won't be disappointed.Examine your budget and figure out exactly how much money you cancomfortably invest. Most people borrow money to buy a house, andmost loan agencies will require you to pay at least 5 percent downin cash. They usually will loan you an amount that results inmonthly payments between 27 percent and 33 percent of your netincome, depending on your debt-to-income ratio, which they willhelp you determine. If you expect to apply for a loan, now is thetime to amend a poor credit rating or establish your credithistory. These factors determine how much interest you'll pay andwhat kind of down payment the bank will require. And don't forgetto consider closing costs, inspections and miscellaneous expenses,which usually add at least a couple thousand dollars payable atclosing.</p><br /><p>If you're planning to buy undeveloped land, you should expect topay at least 20 percent to 50 percent down in cash. Interest ratesfor a loan on the remaining 50 percent to 80 percent probably willbe higher than for home loans.</p><br /><p>When you're ready to buy, shop around to get the best bank loanterms you can. Credit unions may offer competitive rates andusually are easy to join. Mortgage companies have becomeaggressive, creative marketers for loans.</p><br /><p>Check with your lending agency about obtaining pre-approval fora mortgage loan, so you're confident of what you can afford.</p><br /><h3><br /> HOW BIG THE MORTGAGE?</h3><br /><p>A lot of people fantasize about paying cash for a home. True,you can't beat the security of knowing that you own your place,free and clear. However, keep in mind that the interest you pay onyour home is fully tax-deductible. You may be better off,financially, investing your bankroll and mortgaging the house.</p><br /><p>Most of us buy as much house as we can afford. For that reason,we often end up with a 30-year mortgage on 95 percent of the home'svalue. But an unexpected change in your ability to make loanpayments could put you in dire straits if you've borrowed as muchas you can afford. Even in active markets, homes may take months -or even years - to sell. When you can't make the mortgage payment,those months move agonizingly slow.</p><br /><p>You may want to choose a less expensive home, and put down ahigher percentage of the home's value up front. This lets you avoidmortgage insurance, a big hidden expense that is often required onmortgages above a certain percentage of the home's value. And itoffers no benefits to the buyer - it only protects the bank! Ifyour credit is good, your banker may be willing to supplement yourmortgage with a home-equity loan (essentially a second mortgage),thereby avoiding the cost of mortgage insurance.</p><br /><h3><br /> REAL ESTATE TERMS</h3><br /><p><b>Deed:</b> A written instrument by which title to land isconveyed. If there is a mortgage on the house, the mortgage companyholds the deed until the final payment. Then the owner receives thedeed.</p><br /><p><b>Earnest money</b>: A deposit made by the buyer as evidence ofgood faith when offering to purchase real estate. Earnest money istypically held in an escrow account during the period betweenacceptance of the contract and the closing of the sale, at whichtime it is credited to the buyer.</p><br /><p><b>Easement</b>: A right to use another person's real estate fora specific purpose. The most common type of easement is the rightto travel over another person's land, known as a right-of-way. Inaddition, property owners commonly grant easements for theplacement of utility poles, utility trenches, water lines or sewerlines.</p><br /><p><b>Land contract</b>: A contract where the buyer makes paymentsdirectly to the seller, who is still financially responsible forthe property. Beware: If the seller defaults on his mortgage, youcould lose your property.</p><br /><p><b>Title insurance</b>: Protection for lenders or homeowners,provided by a title company, against financial loss resulting fromlegal defects in the title, which is a history of the ownership ofthe property.</p><br /><p>An added benefit to <b>home-equity loans:</b> If you're buyingan expensive home worth more than, say, $300,000, you may be stuckpaying higher 'jumbo' interest rates. A home-equity loan couldbring your mortgage balance below the limit, and secure a cheaperrate. And the interest you pay on home-equity loans is generallytax-deductible - just like your mortgage.</p><br /><p>If you expect your income to drop within the next 15 years, youmight prefer a higher monthly payment now and a paid-off home in 15years. If you think you will retire in that period, your income maydecrease to a level where the mortgage-tax deduction isn't thatbeneficial. Many banks offer 15-year mortgages at rates preferableto those on 30-year mortgages.</p><br /><p>Remember, though, if you are going to have debt of any kind -car loans, revolving credit, whatever - you probably want to secureit with your home. You'll generally pay less interest, and theinterest will be deductible.</p><br /><p>Or if you decide not to be tied to a loan, read Rob Roy's book,<i>Mortgage Free</i>, which offers sound steps to financialfreedom. To order, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.MotherEarthShopping.aspx">MOTHER'SBookshelf</a>.</p><br /><h3><br /> TO AGENT OR NOT TO AGENT</h3><br /><p>A lot of us idealize the 'handshake deal' between two trusting,like-minded individuals. Nothing can spoil that vision quicker thana property-boundary dispute or toxic runoff from the neighbor'smanure containment. Many real estate deals self-destruct before thepapers are signed, just because communication breaks down duringnegotiations.</p><br /><p>If you're a seller, you may want to hire a lawyer and puttogether your own transaction with a buyer. It can be a lotcheaper.</p><br /><p>But if you're a buyer, there's not much logic in avoiding thereal estate specialists. In fact, with the way the business worksthese days, you should probably start your search for a home with atrusted 'buyer's representative' who is a licensed real estateagent. Their fee will likely come from the commission paid by theseller.</p><br /><p>Here's what an agent can do for you:</p><br /><p>Access the multiple-listing service in your area to give you thewidest possible choice of properties. Share expertise regardingvaluations and locations, schools, amenities and other importantinformation. Share experience of other deals, and help you make theright moves in negotiations. Negotiate directly with other realestate agents, who probably have a lot more experience than youdo.</p><br /><p>One important no-no: If you find a house and don't already havean agent, do not let the seller's agent select a buyer'srepresentative for you. Interview some real estate agents andchoose your own, based on your personal rapport.</p><br /><h3>NINE STEPS TO SUCCESS</h3><br /><ol><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Know your <i>budget</i> and stick to it. Even if you'vepre-qualified for a certain amount, you don't have to shop for ahouse or property that meets the loan's maximum. It's better to beconservative.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>List your <i>'needs and wants,'</i> such as square-footagerequirements, lot size and proximity to work. Your budget largelywill determine your choices; prioritize your list and be preparedto make some concessions.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Check weekly for <i>new listings</i>. Most real estate firmshave Web sites and are multi-listed, enabling you to search allavailable home and land listings in a particular area. Read thelocal newspaper for new listings and open houses. The more youstudy the market, the better idea you'll have about what's a 'fairprice.' Don't depend solely on your agent.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Get the <i>listing sheets</i> for any houses you are interestedin, and check each listing against your 'needs and wants' list.Besides giving you the property's pertinent information, such aslot dimensions, room sizes and the age of the house, the listingsheet also may tell you how long the property has been on themarket, which may give you some bargaining leverage.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Get the <i>seller's disclosure sheet</i> for each property youvisit. In many localities, a seller must fill out a multi-pageddisclosure sheet, assessing the house from foundation to roof. If adisclosure sheet is not required by law, ask the sellers tocomplete one anyway. Although not as reliable as an independentinspection, seller's disclosure sheets are very useful tools fordetermining any current deficiencies known to the owners. If youpurchase the house and then discover a defect that the sellershould have acknowledged on the disclosure sheet, have your realestate agent address the issue.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Make an appointment to <i>view the property</i>. Take a friendalong to help you make an objective examination and spot anyexisting or potential problems.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><i>Take notes</i>. Viewing prospective properties is bothenergizing and exhausting. You may think you'll remember everyunique feature of each property, but after viewing even a few, mostpeople can't keep track of all the pros and cons unless they takenotes. Take the listing sheet and disclosure form with you to eachproperty and jot down your observations directly on the listingsheet.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Make sure to <i>view the properties during the day</i>, when youcan thoroughly inspect property boundaries, the house exterior,etc. When you're perusing a property, also request that the ownernot be present. It's much easier to poke in closets and cupboardsand ask questions of the real estate agent without the home owneron site. A house may look great with fresh paint and new carpet,but any potential long-term problems will be hard to detect. Checkout closets and cupboards, under the sink, behind the furnace, incrawl spaces and attics. Flush the toilets and run the faucets.Open the windows. Look for leaks and cracks.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Most importantly, <i>ask lots of questions</i>. You need tolearn as much as you can before you make an offer. For majorconcerns, <i>get the answers in writing</i>. If it's a property onwhich you want to make an offer, don't hesitate to visit it severaltimes. Besides inspecting and reinspecting the property, spend sometime <i>walking and driving around the neighborhood</i> andchatting with neighbors. Visit at various hours of the day andduring different days of the week. Investigate the zoning aroundthe property, especially if it sits near undeveloped land. Thatsweet wildflower meadow that lies behind your dream house may beslated to house an industrial hog farm.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ol><br /><h3><br /> WHEELING & DEALING</h3><br /><p>Buying a house involves more than just offering a certain priceand having it accepted. Only part of the offer is about the price.The rest of it relates to inspections, repairs, and what is or isnot included with the purchase of the house. When you're ready tomake an offer, you should have a real estate agent representingonly your interests (a 'buyer's representative'). If you'renegotiating a private transaction, consider retaining an attorney.Remember: Buying a house is the largest single investment most ofus ever make. Better safe than sorry.</p><br /><p>If you find what you think is your perfect property, beware ofbecoming too enamored with it. Be ready to walk away from a dealthat doesn't meet your needs. Remember that you're in control: Setthe terms the way you want them.</p><br /><p>Before your agent writes up your offer (your realtor willprovide the appropriate paperwork), ask for copies of any priorhouse-inspection reports that were done. If none have been done, westrongly recommend that you make your offer contingent on awhole-house inspection: At $150 to $500, it is well worth theinvestment. An independent contractor will inspect the house andprovide you with a written, detailed report on the house'sstructure, roof, wiring, plumbing, foundation and windows. Considerincluding a clause in your offer stipulating that the seller mustpay for any necessary repairs exceeding a certain amount. Even ifno major problems are discovered, you'll learn a great deal aboutthe home when you review the report with the inspector.</p><br /><p>Not everything is covered in most 'whole-house' inspections.Other specific inspections, such as termite, chimney, well orseptic, should be negotiated with the seller, and should bestipulated in your offer to purchase.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>BUYING IN THE COUNTRY</h3><br /><p>If you've decided that you want to plant your roots in a ruralarea, you'll need to consider these additional issues.</p><br /><p><b>Water.</b> How is the property supplied with water? Ifthere's a well, make your offer contingent on inspections toconfirm the well is in good condition. You may want to specify thatthe well provide a certain number of gallons per minute. Have thewater tested for nitrates, bacteria and any other possiblecontaminants that may endanger your health. (Ask the healthdepartment what problems may be present in the local watersupply.)</p><br /><p>If there is not a water source on the property, be sure to takethat into account when you decide how much you're willing to offer.If you plan to drill a well, realize there is always a chance thedriller will not be able to locate water on the property. You maybe able to get some idea in advance of the odds you'll find goodwater by checking with hydrologists at the agency that regulateswater use in your state.</p><br /><p><b>Sewage.</b> Most country properties use a septic system toprocess graywater and sewage from sinks, showers and toilets. Thehomeowner's disclosure may indicate the septic system has workedwell in the past, but you should still request an inspection aspart of the purchase offer agreement. If you're buying land, theseller should have conducted a preliminary 'perc' test to determineif the soil and site are suitable for a conventional septic system.Check local rules; be sure you know what will be required beforeyou make a purchase offer.</p><br /><p><b>Electricity.</b> Today, the utility grid supplies most ruralhomes with power. If there's currently no electric service to theproperty and you want to tap into grid power, you'll need theelectric company to give you a bid on bringing in lines. If a poleis already on the property, only a line has to be dropped to thebuildings and a meter installed, a relatively inexpensiveprocedure. If there's no pole adjacent to the property, the costeasily may run into thousands of dollars, depending on how far theline must be run from the nearest pole. Investigate installingunderground lines, which may be more attractive and dependable -and sometimes not much more costly.</p><br /><p>Producing your own energy using solar or wind generation may beyour best bet, but be sure to research any zoning regulations thatmight limit their use. (Putting in a photovoltaic system usually isnot limited by zoning rules, but putting up a 100-foot wind towermay be.)</p><br /><p><b>Water and mineral rights.</b> It's not uncommon for aproperty to have mineral or water rights attached to the deed. Thetitle should list these rights, and you should have the titlecompany or your attorney explain the ramifications and limitationsthese rights can impose on the property - before you make anoffer.</p><br /><p><b>Zoning.</b> Zoning ordinances and building permits vary fromstate to state, county to county and even between municipalities.If you have a certain project in mind for your property, check withthe local building inspector to see if it can be permitted. Zoningordinances designate land for certain functions, such as farming,industry or housing, and can limit how your land can be used. Localbuilding codes govern how you can build. Some locales may permitunique projects under an 'experimental' clause, but this can becostly, especially if an engineer is required to review your plans.If you intend to use green building techniques or want to have aDr. Doolittle farm with lots of animals, investigate potentialzoning or building permit limitations.</p><br /><p><b>Rights-of-way.</b> Roads, power lines and gas linesfrequently cross parcels of land and may interfere with your plansfor the property. If a neighboring property has no road frontage,it may have a permanent, deeded easement through the property youare considering. Or if you have to drive on a private road to reachthe property you are considering, make sure that you retain thispermanent easement on the title. If there is a road on the propertythat you can't account for and no mention of an easement on thedeed or title, ask the current owner if an easement agreementexists with any neighbors.</p><br /><p><b>Survey.</b> In most cases you should know the exactboundaries of the lot or acreage you are considering. If surveymarkers are not in place, request a survey be done.</p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green_Home_Building/2003_Febuary_March/Finding_Your_Place">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>Living the Good Life</i> by Helen and ScottNearing, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> March/April 1977</h4><br /><p><br /> There's an old Spanish proverb which holds that, 'The best revengeis to live well.' And if that's true, then Helen and Scott Nearing,(without ever having been vengeful at all) have had - and stillhave - the very best revenge of all.</p><br /><p>Because the Nearings have lived quite well indeed in all theways that really matter. And they have done it entirely on theirown terms and at their own pace. And they have done it far longer(Helen is 74 and Scott is 93) than most of their detractors everhave or ever will.</p><br /><p>Helen and Scott Nearing have been living today's counterculturefor better than a generation. Almost four decades ago (in 1932),the couple 'dropped out' to a rock-scrabble mountain farm inVermont's Green Mountains where they spent the next 20 yearsrebuilding the soil, constructing solid homestead buildings fromnative stone, growing their own food, heating with wood they cut byhand, and co-authoring numerous books and magazine articles. Tickoff any of the present's most 'in' passions - women's lib, equalrights, organic gardening, vegetarianism, radicalism, homesteading,subsistence farming, ecology - and you'll find that the Nearingshave been doing instead of talking for 40 years.</p><br /><p>In 1952, when 'developers' began despoiling the slopes aroundthem for a ski resort, the Nearings sold their Vermont farm, movedto a remote Maine cape and began all over again ... clearing brush,building honest stone structures, planting vigorous gardens, and -in general - making their place in the world on a soul-satisfying,sweat-of-the-brow basis.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/1977_March_April/Living_the_Good_Life_with_Helen_and_Scott_Nearing__excerpted_from_their_boo">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /></div><br /><p><br /></p><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>Back to the Land in Louisiana</i> by RobinWright, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> April/May 2004<br /><br /></h4><br /><p>For years I had talked with my parents and my sister about allof us buying land in the country, building houses, growing gardens,hunting and fishing, and being able to help each other.

Weall worked together in a building-supply business in Baton Rouge,Louisiana.</p><br /><p>'Put up or shut up,' they said. And, as both men grinned at me,it began to sink in that this was good news.'We've found theperfect piece of property, only 30 minutes from the office,' theytold me. 'Fifty acres of fenced pastures stocked ponds, a nicehouse, two barns and two beautiful homesites.'</p><br /><p>It was an easy decision. The property was so perfect that wecould hardly wait to move.

Myparents would move into the existing house, and my sister and Iwould each build a new house on the property.</p><br /><p>My husband, Ricky, and I sold our house quickly and bought atrailer to live in while building our new home. After settling intothe trailer, we began buying old building materials with the goalof building a new house that truly looked old.</p><br /><p>It took us two years to finally move into our new home, which isabout 2,800 square feet in size and constructed of many recycledmaterials. We used antique pine and cypress lumber, oak flooring,antique light fixtures and claw-foot tubs - anything we could getour hands on from old buildings that had been torn down. We lovebeing able to reuse things instead of throwing them away, but wealso just love old houses.

I just never realizedhow much pleasure one could get from something as simple as raisingchickens. I guess people could say, 'Simple joys for simple minds.'But people say a lot of things. In my homesteading adventure I'velearned simplicity is the seed of joy, and finding your ownlifestyle is the root of peace. .</p><br /><p>My husband and I have been homesteading for about 10 years invarious locations. We seem to be compelled by circumstances to moveevery two years or so. This has given me ample opportunity toperfect my carpentry skills: Just as I finish building rabbithutches, chicken coops and woodsheds, I have to start again at anew location. I've also established my share of vegetable andperennial flower gardens. At times, I feel like the JohnnyAppleseed of echinacea. Because of my parents' health, Bill and Irecently sold our homestead and are starting afresh near them inthe very northernmost of northern New York. I don't worry, though.We have establishing a homestead down pat.</p><br /><p>That's not to say that homesteading is easy, but things worthdoing rarely are. The work can indeed be never-ending, but so can'modern' work. I spent years caught in the monotony of office workand am certain I prefer the repetition of homestead chores to thedrudgery I experienced 'at work.' There, I brought home a paycheck.Here, the rewards are so much greater: feeling a wonderful sense ofaccomplishment, bringing my own food to my own table, being my ownboss and setting my own priorities and work schedule.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Livestock_and_Farming/2002_April_May/Small_Pleasures_Bring_Big_Joy">READ THE FULL STORY<br /></a><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><br /><h2><a name="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Skills" id="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Skills"></a>Homesteading andSelf-reliance: Essential Skills</h2><br /><br /><br /><div align="left">There are dozens of homesteading skills andcrafts that will allow you to be more self-reliant, such as makingyour own clothes, shoes and candles, knitting, weaving and tanning.For these articles and many more, read our Featured Article, 'Do ItYourself,' at <b>www.motherearth????.</b><br /><br /> To learn homesteading skills such as wood splitting, tractordriving, installing a fence or running a chain saw talk with yourlocal County Extension agent, go to farm fairs and festivals orhire yourself out for a few weeks on a working farm.

The urge to 'getthe wood in' runs deep. It's an itch that kicks up when the leavesbegin turning in mid-August and that won't stay scratched until thesnow season's fuel supply is split, stacked, and ready to hand.</p><br /><p>There is an art and a science to building a woodpile. Some saythere's a spiritual side to it as well, but I can't help you muchwith that. You'd have to come to meeting already knowing thatthere's something more to a tree than wood, bark and leaves as theIndians and the old-time French-Canadian axemen did, and the way afew modern woodsmen and women still do.</p><br /><p>Firewood just dumped in a heap won't dry and it won't burn well.Rain will run down and soak into cut ends while ground moisturewill migrate up and soak into spongy inner bark. But even thetoughest ash and beech fire logs will start quickly and burnefficiently (with little creosote-making smoke) if seasoned in thewoods for 6 months to a year, sectioned to stove length, the biglogs half-split, and all of it piled in the woodshed or barn forsome months more. The hardwood should be quartered; the pine shouldbe split to kindling and piled again to surface-dry in a warmcellar for a few weeks or months and finally brought upstairs toheat and dry crisp for a day or two near the stove. Henry Thoreauneglected the work of piling and repiling when he wrote, 'Woodwarms you twice ... once when you cut it and again when you burnit.' By my count it warms you six or seven times - most of that inbuilding and tearing down woodpiles.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><br /><h4><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/1994_October_November/The_Science_of_Wood_Stacking">READ THE FULL STORY</a></h4><br /><br /><br /><div align="left"><br /><h4>Adapted from <i>Woodstove Buyer's Guide</i> by John Gulland,<i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> December/January 2002</h4><br /><p>The golden glow and cozy warmth of a wood fire have drawn familyand friends to the hearth. A woodstove truly does help transform ahouse into a home. But here in the super-high-tech 21st century,does a return to our heritage heating fuel make sense for yourhousehold?<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>TOP 10 REASONS TO HEAT WITH WOOD</h3><br /><ol><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>It's a renewable energy resource.</b></p><br /><p>Wood is energy from the sun, stored by the tree as it grows.When you burn wood you are releasing this stored energy. In thedark of winter, it's like having a bit of summer sun on yourhearth.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>It's an Earth-friendly choice.</b></p><br /><p>When fuels burn they release carbon dioxide, one of thegreenhouse gases responsible for global warming. Trees absorbcarbon dioxide as they grow, so when you heat with wood, the carbondioxide is released, then absorbed again by young trees. Becausetrees recycle carbon dioxide, wood burning just warms you, not theglobe.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>You're in charge.</b></p><br /><p>Stop writing checks every month to the energy utilities. Do youreally want to leave something as important as staying warm in thehands of a faceless corporation?</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>No more freezing in the dark.</b></p><br /><p>When a storm interrupts the electrical supply, all theconventional heating systems are useless, but the woodstove keepsyou warm and cozy and safe. Now a power failure isn't so much of adrag: You get to use the candles.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>Wood warms you like no other.</b></p><br /><p>The radiant heat from a stove or fireplace is like the rays ofthe sun. It warms you through and through.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>The romance of the flame.</b></p><br /><p>The soft glow of firelight is the favorite setting for anintimate conversation. It's the place where friends and familygather to talk and laugh in comfort.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>Raise your energy I.Q.</b></p><br /><p>Each log you place on the fire is a visual reminder of theenvironmental impact of keeping your family warm. It's the <i>woodheat way of knowing</i>.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>Heat a space, save some energy.</b></p><br /><p>That stove or fireplace in the living room keeps you warm andcozy in the place you spend your time. The basement and bedroomsstay cool. Regardless of what you pay for energy, space heatingwith wood clips 25 percent right off the top.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>Invest in your community.</b></p><br /><p>Spend a buck on oil, natural gas or electricity and you feed acorporate giant. Spend a buck on firewood and you feed aneighbor.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p><b>It's cheaper!</b></p><br /><p>Wood is the cheapest heating fuel you can use if you don't livein a large city. Some people actually think the only reason we heatwith wood is to save money. Poor souls, they miss so much of whatis good in life.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ol><br /><p>Whether you decide to make wood your primary heating fuel orjust want to spend winter evenings around a warm, flickering fire,you'll need to choose from a bewildering array of options: elegantenameled woodstoves, high-efficiency fireplaces, furnaces or evencookstoves. Here's what you need to help you make the right choice,including a comprehensive list of stove models, sizes, prices andother details.</p><br /><p>The benefits of home heating with wood are numerous: comfort,beauty, independence, security and environmental responsibility.Surely the most discussed advantage is the promise of cost savingscompared with the mainstream alternatives. Although there are manyvariables involved, you can almost certainly save money by heatingwith wood if there are forests in your region and you don't live ina city. If the recent volatility of oil, gas and electricity pricesprovides a hint of the future, the savings could increase in theyears ahead.

And when we purchased our Woodstocker to cutoil costs, we never gave a thought to using it as a cookingstove.<br /><p>But one day, bolstered by the surprising amount of heatdispensed by our stove, we tentatively approached it with teakettle in hand. Once we were successful (with a little patience),we quickly graduated to soups and stews. Though ours doesn't havethe versatility of a wood cookstove designed for kitchen duty, itdoes have some workable similarities.</p><br /><p>The surface of our woodstove isn't usually hot enough for fryingfoods but it is perfect for simmering and slow cooking. We've evenmanaged to use our 'oven' (firebox) in much the same way as we useour charcoal grill in the summertime.</p><br /><h3>GRILLING</h3><br /><p>The hot coals will cook foil-wrapped vegetables or individualpackets of meat. For baked potatoes, wrap them in heavy duty foiland place in the hot ashes of the fire. These will take from 45minutes to one hour to cook.</p><br /><p>Corn can be cooked in foil, too. Strip husks down to the end ofthe ear but don't tear off. Remove silk, butter generously, andbring husks up around corn, making sure all the kernels arecovered. Wrap in double thickness of heavy-duty foil, twist ends,and nestle in hot ashes.</p><br /><p>Sliced zucchini can be seasoned with oregano and mixed withchopped tomato and butter. Double wrap and cook in ashes. Smallbeets can be cooked directly on the hot coals: Just sprinkle themwith water, dot with chunks of butter, and double wrap inheavy-duty foil.</p><br /><p>For grilled chicken, marinate 2-inch pieces of chicken breast insoy sauce, some powdered ginger, a little sugar and garlic powderto taste for two hours. Place a few pieces and some marinade in adouble wrapping of heavy-duty foil. Repeat until all the chicken iswrapped tightly, then place the packets on the coals untildone.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>ALL-IN-ONES<br /></h3><br /><p>Individual meals, such as the Hobo Dinner, can be cooked inpound-size coffee cans nestled in hot coals. Shape one-half poundof ground beef into a large patty the size of the bottom of thecoffee can. Top with sliced onions, a sliced potato, and one-halfear of corn; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover can tightly withdouble-wrapped aluminum foil. Nestle can among hot coals, but donot set directly on top of them. This will take at least an hour tocook.</p><br /><p>There is no way to gauge the heat of the fire, so you cannottime the cooking process. Use a two-pronged fork to check thetenderness of the vegetables (we like ours with just a littlecrunch left).<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>BAKING<br /></h3><br /><p>There are various woodstove baking ovens on the market forcooking small baked goods, but an inverted cast iron pot has workedwell for us. I place the cover of the pot upside down on the stove,put a bread pan or small muffin pan on top of that, and then topthe cover and pan with inverted cooking pot.</p><br /><p>Granted, this is a crude contraption and it does seem to takeforever sometimes for the baked goods to be done, but it works - itjust takes longer than a conventional oven.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>COOKWARE<br /></h3><br /><p>Traditional cast-iron cookware is by far the most effectiveutensil for woodstove use. Cast iron provides even heat and needslittle care. Each piece should be treated to stave off rust and toprevent foods from sticking. To accomplish this, coat the pan withvegetable oil and heat for two hours in a 300-degree oven. Checkperiodically to see if the oil has been absorbed and add more ifnecessary. Let cool and wipe off any excess. After you've finishedcooking, clean the pot with paper towels and scour stubborn spotswith salt (avoid cleaning with soap or detergents).</p><br /><br /><p>Cooking techniques vary little whether the fuel is wood or coal:The difference is in the higher intensity of heat from the burningof coal. With either fuel, the heat is often not evenly distributedon the stove's surface.</p><br /><p>The real trick is to move the pots around, depending upon yourneeds. If a pot is bubbling too hard, either move it to a coolerarea on the woodstove or set it on a metal trivet. If more heat isrequired, set the pan directly over the area where the coals areburning hottest, which is usually in the center of thestovetop.</p><br /><p>As confidence in your ability to cook on a woodstove grows, sowill your assurance that almost anything can be cooked on awoodstove. Your imagination is your greatest tool, and your cookingmethods are uniquely your own.</p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/1991_December_January/Tasty_Tips_for_Cooking_on_Your_Woodburning_Stoves">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /></div><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><h4 align="left">Excerpted from <i>The Many Methods of Mowing</i>by Jeff Cox, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> February/March 2002</h4><br /><div align="left">The beauty of a lawn or meadow, as well as thebenefit of usable outdoor space, makes mowing worth the work. Aswith any chore, however, the right tool makes the job go easier.Let's look at the tools available and consider their merits,starting with the nonpolluting, human-powered options.<br /><h3>Reel Mowers: $100 to $225</h3><br /><p>Hand-pushed reel mowers offer multiple advantages overgas-powered mowers: no noise, no noxious air pollution, no dangerof flying rocks, low maintenance and no worries about getting themstarted. Plus you get a great aerobic workout every time you usethem, burning about 300 calories an hour.</p><br /><p>The secret to easy cutting with these mowers is frequent mowing.If you let the grass get too long, the reel mower blades will tendto bind up or take an inordinate amount of pushing to get the mowerthrough long grass. Cut when the grass is no more than an inchlonger than you want it. A quarter acre (100 feet by 160 feet) oflawn can be cut in about an hour with a reel mower. For areaslarger than that, you may want to go to a walk-behind, gas-poweredcutter, either push or self-propelled.</p><br /><h5>Reel Mower Sources:</h5><br /><p>Lehman's Hardware<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lehmans.com">www.lehmans.com</a></p><br /><p>Sunlawn Imports<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sunlawn.com">www.sunlawn.com</a></p><br /><p>American Lawn Mower Co.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reelin.com">www.reelin.com<br /><br /></a></p><br /><h3>Electric Mowers: $400 to $670</h3><br /><p>You can buy corded electric mowers that run directly off of yourhome's electricity, but keeping the cord out of the way as you mowis a challenge on all but the smallest lawns. On the other hand,cordless electric mowers offer the same advantages of reel mowers:less noise, pollution and maintenance than gas-powered machines,easy starting, plus a good workout. They are an especially greenchoice if you live where electricity comes from hydroelectric dams- rather than coal or nuclear power plants - or if you enjoy freeelectricity from your own home solar-electric system or windgenerator.</p><br /><p>Cordless electric mowers include batteries that have to beplugged into an outlet after each use to recharge. They generallyare not self-propelled and tend to be heavy because of theirbatteries. If a small person will be using the mower, test drive itat the dealers.</p><br /><p>Even greener than a cordless electric mower is the new<a target="_blank" href="http://www.freepowersys.com">Sunwhisper</a> solar-chargedmower. The Sunwhisper features two Siemens photovoltaic (PV) solarpanels that charge a Black & Decker 24-volt, CMMI000 cordlesselectric mower. You can either mount the PV panels on your garageor shed roof, or mount them right on the handles of the mower. Aslong as the panels are facing south in full sun, they will keep themower's battery charged for about two hours of mowing per week. Ifyou need an overnight or cloudy-day charge, you still have theoption to recharge by plugging into a home outlet.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>Push-Type, Gas-Powered Lawn Mowers: $150 to $350</h3><br /><p>You might ask why you'd want an engine-powered mower you have topush rather than one that's self-propelled. There are threereasons. First, the push mowers cost less. Second, whileself-propelled mowers are fine on large lawns without manyobstacles, the mower you push can be more easily guided throughtight spaces, around trees and shrubs, and around island beds. Plusits forward or backward speed is your walking speed. Third, all butthe most serious full-time homesteaders will benefit from a weeklyaerobic workout behind a push mower.</p><br /><p>Most mowers of this type have four- to six-horsepower engines.Avoid any that are underpowered, as they can stall in high grassand won't make as clean a swath. Look for engines withclean-burning, overhead valves, rather than side-valve engines.Make sure the mowing platform can be adjusted up to 4 inches offthe ground. Weeds are suppressed and lawns are healthier when thegrass is longer. Short-cropped grass exposes roots, and low mowerscan hit rocks or scalp the soil over rough spots.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>Self-Propelled, Gas-Powered Lawn Mowers: $200 to $800</h3><br /><p>Self-propelled, gas-engine mowers reduce some of the physicalwork of mowing but cost somewhat more than push versions. If youdecide to buy a self-propelled model, be aware of several factorsthat can affect their performance.</p><br /><p>First, if you are planning to leave your clippings on the lawn,look for a mulching deck. This is simply a series of baffles andblades fixed to the underside of the housing that covers therotating blade. When grass is cut, the baffles recirculate thegrass clippings until they are reduced to fine mulch, whichdisappears quickly.</p><br /><p>Many self-propelled mowers have safety features, such as ablade-brake-clutch. For the blade to operate, you have to hold alever down as part of the handle. When you pause the unit orrelease the clutch lever, the blade stops automatically.</p><br /><p>Some mowers offer a drive system that adjusts to your walkingpace.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>Riding Mowers: $800 to $3,200</h3><br /><p>Big lawns require significant mowing time. Riding mowers havethe great advantage of giving you a place to sit down while youspend that time. They are lighter and smaller than heavy-duty lawnand garden tractors, without the latter's features, such as powertake-offs for snowblowing and tillage, and blades for grading. Ineffect, they are lawn mowers with seats.</p><br /><p>The White LT1650 is Consumer Reports' Best Buy riding mower.</p><br /><p>Features to look for include a short turning radius, which canrun from zero up to 26 inches. A turning radius is measured bysteering the mower into the tightest circle it can make. The radiusof that circle is the turning radius. A zero turning radius meansyou can stop the mower, turn the wheels and zip off in any newdirection you choose. A short turning radius is handy for lawnswith lots of obstacles, trees and flowerbeds.</p><br /><p>Many riding mowers come with mulching decks, a good idea if youwant to recycle your clippings back onto the lawn. The mulchingdeck will chop the clippings finely, so they disappear into thelawn. Make sure the riding mower has a powerful engine of at leasteight horsepower, so it can lug you around the yard as well as cutthe grass.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>Brush Cutters: $750 to $1,600</h3><br /><p>For rough work - such as giving a meadow, orchard or wet spot aonce-a-year mowing - there are plenty of brawny-bladed trimmers,high wheel mowers and brush cutters on the market.</p><br /><p>Bladed trimmers are handhelds similar to string trimmers, butare sturdier. They usually have two handlebars, gas rn with one ortwo horsepower and metal blades that hack through brushy stems.</p><br /><p>High wheel mowers and brush cutters come with plastic string orblades. String trimmers work well on light, juicy weeds and grass,but for getting through small shrubs and saplings, you'll probablywant a bladed mower.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>One Motor, Many Options: Starting from $1,100 to $1,600</h3><br /><p>Many homesteads need more power equipment than just a mower.Rather than buy a mower, tiller and snowblower, all with their ownmotors, gears and wheels, you might want to consider a machine thatcan run several attachments from the same engine. For example, theItalian BCS tiller is a quality machine offered by mail from<a target="_blank" href="http://www.groworganic.com">PeacefulValley Farm Supply</a> (888) 784-1722. You can remove the tillerand attach a mower, brush cutter or snowblower to this machine. TheDR Field and Brush Mower offers similar flexibility and efficiency.You can buy the brush mower, then add a lawn mower or snow thrower.The BCS tillers start at $1,100 and the DR starts at $1,600. If youhave a need for multiple power equipment functions, why not talk tosome of your neighbors and see if you can form a co-op to purchaseand share this kind of machinery?<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><br /><h4><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2002_Febuary_March/The_Many_Methods_of_Mowing">READ THE FULL STORY<br /><br /></a></h4><br /></div><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>The Scythe</i> by Elliot Fishbein, <i>MotherEarth News</i> February/March 2002<br /><br /></h4><br /><p>The scythe is simply the most efficient and graceful tool formowing. It cuts heavy weeds and tall grass with ease, and withpractice can be precise enough to cut and trim your lawn. It willsilently outcut your string trimmer and venture where a push or gaslawn mower becomes useless. The scythe does all this with littlephysical effort, noise or pollution.</p><br /><p>There are two styles of scythes, the European and the American.<b>The European scythe</b> blade is made light, thin and strongwithout excess material.Its strength comes from the curves andtension of the skinlike structure. This design has been refinedthrough the centuries to be efficient and minimal. The blade isfitted to a lightweight wooden handle called a snath. The grips arecomfortably positioned, permitting an upright, stress-free stance,and the blade is adjusted to skim parallel to the ground. Formaximum performance and enjoyment the snath should be customized tofit the user's body proportions.</p><br /><p>To mow, the blade is drawn from right to left in an arc. Onlythe leading third of the blade enters the uncut grass. Thisshearing action slices the grass like scissors. Falling grasscaught by the blade and snath is deposited in a tidy pile at theend of each stroke. A stroke takes about as much effort as paddlinga canoe.The mower can set a pace that is sustainable. The Europeanblade has a curved back that allows it to ride in close contactwith the ground.</p><br /><p>The blade remains in contact with the ground during both thecutting and return stroke: There is no reason to lift it.</p><br /><p>The stroke does not require great physical strength and does notrely on blade speed. It is not necessary to quickly rip the scythethrough the grass. The stroke is deliberate and accurate. Theshifting of your weight from side to side and the twisting of yourtorso power the blade. Occasionally you must stop to hone the bladeand look behind to admire the precision of the windrow that'sformed. In a good stand of grass even a child can cut a 7-foot-wideswath with each stroke. For full details on how to use and maintaina scythe, see the workshop pages of <a target="_blank" href="http://Scythesupply.com">Scythesupply.com</a>.</p><br /><p>Sharpening a European scythe is a combination of hammering(called peening) and honing with a whetstone. The cutting edge isoccasionally drawn out thin by using a hammer and a small anvil. Inthe field the blade is frequently and quickly honed with awater-soaked stone to maintain the sharp edge.</p><br /><p><b>The American scythe</b> is the type commonly found in toolsheds, antique shops and, unfortunately, in hardware stores. Thisscythe is harder to use and less efficient than the European style.This American pattern is mostly responsible for the scythe'sreputation as a backbreaking, difficult tool.</p><br /><p>The European scythe is an elegant combination of simplicity andcompetence. The rewards of using the tool are worth the effort inlearning.<br /><br /></p><br /><p><b>Sources for European Scythes:</b></p><br /><p>Scythe Supply<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scythesupply.com">www.scythesupply.com</a></p><br /><p>Johnny's Selected Seed Catalog<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com">www.johnnyseeds.com</a></p><br /><p>Lehman's Hardware and Appliances, Inc.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lehmans.com">www.lehmans.com</a></p><br /><p>Peaceful Valley Farm Supply<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.groworganic.com">www.groworganic.com</a><br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2002_Febuary_March/The_Scythe">READ THE FULL STORY<br /><br /><br /></a><br /><div align="left"><br /><h4>Adapted from <i>The Forge: Elementary Metalworking</i> by JohnVivian, <i>Mother Earth New</i> February/March 2000</h4><br /><p>Alas both the village smithy and the spreading chestnut tree aregone, done in by what passed for progress in its day but soundsdepressingly familiar in this one. Industrial mechanizationreplaced a thousand smithies' 'large and sinewy hands' with asingle water-powered trip hammer, while a blight, unwittinglyimported with expanded global trade, decimated the proud chestnutto a few stump sprouts. Along with these disappeared the tinsmiths,whitesmiths, cutlers, coopers and a dozen more metal trades of ourhandcrafted, preindustrial past. And, in this writer's view, alongwith the handworking trades went much of the attitude of sturdy,independent self-reliance that made America great.</p><br /><p>Two hundred years ago, nearly everything was handcrafted,custom-made, made-from-scratch - by tradesmen or by the farmer andhis wife. When junior was old enough to make a first proud steptoward manhood by donning long pants, mother hand-stitched thebritches from homespun cloth and father made the belt from harnessleather and hammered out a belt buckle on the small forge, an artthat was a feature of every farm. Not many of us will be making aniron belt buckle for our sons these days. For one thing, the otherstudents would laugh him out of school as decidedly uncool. And, inthis age of mass production, we could do better by selling thebuckle as a handcrafted, neoantique rarity at the Craft Shoppe intown and buying the kid a whole new wardrobe with the proceeds.</p><br /><p>But a working knowledge of the metal crafts has a too-oftenneglected place on the self-reliant family farmsteads of folks likeyou and me. Among our sacrifices, we've accepted responsibility formaintaining our own house and outbuildings, farm and gardenequipment, autos and trucks, plumbing and wiring. All of thesedepend on arcane metal parts that when they fail, cause the typicalin-town householder to call in a hideously expensive plumber, autotech or electrician to perform repairs for them. (Or else, theyrush out to buy an all-new appliance, part or gadget that is likelyeven shoddier - with more plastic than steel or brass - than thedecades-old original that just broke.)</p><br /><p>Easier, cheaper, quicker and vastly rewarding is to repair orreplace the metal part yourself.</p><br /><p>Yet, the very idea of working metal leaves most of us as cold asthe steel itself. Few of us are brought up anymore realizing thatwe have the aptitude to form metal; metal has become the exclusivemedium of the mass manufacturer. Odd, this, since any countryperson who maintains a house and barn learns basic woodworking.Granted, warm once-living wood is intuitively more inviting thancold, unyielding metal. But the fact is you work metal the same asyou work wood, only metals are harder.

Over the years, not a single one ever stole my heart. Having aquality, 12-inch skillet ought to be a necessity of life, though,along with shoes, cell phones and brie (OK, maybe not brie), sofinally, I set out to find my 'one and only.'</p><br /><p>As it turned out, I found several skillets that tickled myfancy: Calphalon's Commercial and Kitchen Essentials lines,All-Clad Metalcrafter's own brand (my favorite!) and Emerilware,developed by All-Clad with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. Here arethe most important points to consider when you're searching for askillet that will steal your heart.</p><br /><h3>SKILLET SHOP BUT NOT 'TILL YOU DROP</h3><br /><p>Most all-purpose skillets have either flared or straight sides.Those with flared sides are called fry or omelet pans, and usuallycome without lids; food just slides right out of these pans andonto a plate. Those with straight sides are called saute pans, andthey come with lids.</p><br /><p>I decided to limit my spending to less than $150, although it'spossible to buy skillets that cost twice that price. I testednumerous skillets for 'release-ability' (whether the food stuck tothe pan), heat distribution and cooking time. I cooked a variety offoods, including eggs, pancakes, eggplant, plantains, tofu andchicken.</p><br /><p>Appearance, durability, feel and whether the skillet was oven-or broiler-safe also were evaluated.</p><br /><p><b>Appearance.</b> This may seem frivolous, but a cookware'sdesign is what initially will attract your attention. Imagine howthe pan will look in your kitchen, on your stove. Evaluate itsscratch-resistance. The best skillets I tested were heavy-gaugemetal pans with stainless steel exteriors; they resisted scratchesand dents better than either black enamel or anodized aluminumpans.</p><br /><p><b>Durability</b> runs a close second to appearance. All theskillets I liked were listed as dishwasher-safe, but companyrepresentatives all recommended hand-washing. Although bettercookware will come with a lifetime warranty, be sure to read thefine print before you buy.</p><br /><p><b>Feel</b> is an important consideration, too. With theexception of cast iron pans, you shouldn't have to pump iron to fryan egg. A skillet should be a comfortable weight, but keep in mindthat quality skillets are heavier than bargain-basement pans. Butdon't confuse 'heavy weight' with 'heavy gauge.' 'Gauge' is ameasurement of the thickness of the metal used in the cookware'sconstruction, not its weight.</p><br /><p>Skillet handles will vary in feel, too, so test them out to findwhich suits you best. Metal handles probably won't feel quite asnice as wooden ones, but they will last forever. For safety's sake,handles should have a 'stay cool' quality and be riveted throughthe pan rather than screwed in place.</p><br /><p>Options such as <b>oven-safe</b> or <b>broiler-safe</b> may beimportant to you, too. The skillets listed here are oven-safe up toa certain temperature, but all are not broiler-safe. If you love tobrown your culinary creations under the broiler, you'll want abroiler-safe skillet.</p><br /><p>If you have an electric range, especially a smooth top, you'llneed a skillet that is ruler-flat on the bottom to ensure uniformcooking. And, if you're buying an omelet or fry pan, you also maywant to find out whether a lid can be purchased separately, eventhough most of the time you won't need it.</p><br /><h3>Cast Iron</h3><br /><p>It's no wonder some folks swear by their trusty cast ironskillets. Virtually indestructible, they cook fast once they'reheated and handle the highest temperatures with ease. They're greatfor Cajun-style blackening; we use my grandma's to blacken fish onthe grill, and to make corn bread in the oven. Iron skilletsimprove with age and can last several lifetimes.</p><br /><p>Secondhand 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillets can be better thannew ones. They're inexpensive, too, at $15 to $20 in flea marketsor antique shops, although the collectible Wagner or Griswoldbrands usually will cost more.</p><br /><p>The downside is these skillets are heavy, the handles get hotand the food can stick if the cast iron isn't properly seasoned orcleaned. There also can be problems with uneven heating, and thereactive metal does absorb and release food odors.</p><br /><p>But on a Wisconsin winter's morning, I just love mybrother-in-law's fried potatoes, cooked in his favorite 16-inchiron skillet, on his wood-burning stove.</p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2003_August_September/In_Search_of_the_Perfect_Skillet">READ THE FULL STOR</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2003_August_September/In_Search_of_the_Perfect_Skillet">Y</a><br /></div><br /><p><br /></p><br /><h4>Adapted from <i>Top 20 Homesteading Tools</i> by John Vivian,<i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> April/May 2001</h4><br /><p><br /> If you're serious about swapping the urban rat race for a life offrugal, back-to-the-land self-sufficiency, the right equipment willmake the difference between paradise and peril. The following listoutlines some of the essential homesteading tools.<br /><br /></p><br /><h3>Basic Hauling</h3><br /><h5 align="center">TRACTORS, CARTS AND WAGONS</h5><br /><p>You'll need a properly sized, wheeled, perhaps engine-poweredmachine to do the heavy hauling. The capacity you'll need and theamount you'll pay will be determined by the size and topography ofyour place, the nature of the work you intend to carry out, yourfinancial resources, maintenance skills, and available storagefacilities. Ideal, albeit impractical for most of us, would be ateam of horses, mules or oxen along with a hay wagon for fieldwork, a buckboard for trips to town, and a barn and paddock. If youobtain beasts of burden, you'll also need pasture, hay and grain tosustain them.<br /><u><b><br /> Commercial-grade Compact Diesel Tractors</b></u><br /><br /> The most universally capable modern homesteading machine we knowof is a commercial-grade compact diesel tractor. We like<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kubota.com">Kubota</a>tractors, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deere.com">JohnDeere's</a> 20- to 48hp 2000 class and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newholland.com">New Holland's</a> Boomer line.Even the smallest models - which look like sturdily built lawntractor mowers - are equipped with powerful diesel engines andindustrial-quality transmissions and running gear. They also sporta three-point rear hitch that will mount commercial farm landplows, harrows and rakes and provide attachment points for a hay orfield corn cutter bar or silage chopper, a sprayer or buzz saw.These tractors include a hydraulic system that will power remotemotors on the chopper's flails, the sprayer's pump or the saw'sblade. A modern, small diesel tractor is a major investment for aranch or truck-farming operation - but one that will expand yourhomesteading capabilities beyond muscle-power, and will pay offevery day for a lifetime or two of strenuous use.</p><br /><p><u><b>Antique Tractors</b></u><br /><br /> An alternative to a new and relatively expensive tractor is awell-running <a target="_blank" href="http://www.antiquetractors.com">antique tractor</a>. They'renot quite as capable or dependable as a contemporary tractor, butthey're considerably less expensive. A small, still-running,antique tractor such as a late 1940s or 50s Farmall Cub or alow-riding, auto-style Ford 9N currently sell for a fraction of theprice of a new one, a little more if they're outfitted with newrear tires or hydraulics. If at all possible, buy one with a newlyrebuilt engine, an onboard hydraulic system, a rear-mountthree-point hitch and one or two mechanical power takeoffs (PTOs)rather than a drawbar.</p><br /><p><u><b>Tractor Attachments</b></u><br /><br /> Invest in a modern under-frame (Woods), rotary brush hog or fieldmower and other post-1950s attachments. Look carefully, becausemuseum-quality antique tractors from the 1930s and earlier oftenlack hydraulics and PTOs. (Polk's, the Antique Tractor Magazine,published by Dennis Polk Equipment of New Paris Indiana and<a target="_blank" href="http://www.farmcollector.com">FarmCollector</a> from the folks at Odgen Publications in Topeka, KSare two great sources of info on older models better suited fordisplaying on the front yard than grinding in the cornrows).</p><br /><p><u><b>Full-size Industrial Tractors</b></u><br /></p><br /><p>If you intend to do any really heavy work such as logging,trenching for soil-drainage pipes, digging in a septic tank orcutting a logging road through heavy woods, consider a <b>full-sizeindustrial tractor</b> with a log grapple or excavating bucket onthe front and a backhoe on the stem. New, they cost five or sixfigures. Good used ones cost about $15,000.</p><br /><p><b>Deere Gator:</b> For moderately heavy hauling chores that donot demand a bulldozer or a two-ton hydraulically equipped tractor,use your local Yellow Pages to find a franchised John Deereservicing dealer for a two- or four-wheel drive Gator. Sized like acut-down jeep and powered and equipped for homestead-scale chores,it seats the driver and one or two passengers comfortably up front,but rides on farm tractor-style, forged-steel driveline components.It is lightweight enough to navigate marshes or hilly wooded tracksthat could bog down a heavy tractor or four-wheel drive truck. Itwill pull a water trailer and, in its rear box, will carry severalhay bales to livestock in a distant, dry pasture.</p><br /><p><b>DR Powerwagon:</b> Next size down in size and capacity arethe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drpower.com">DRPowerwagons</a>, a unique line of powered garden carts made by<a target="_blank" href="http://www.countryhomeproducts.com">Country HomeProducts</a>. All sizes are tank-tough and capable of hauling 800pounds of bricks, firewood, garden compost or rocks. They aremaneuvered by hand with stout handles and castoring wheels at theback, thus avoiding the steering mechanism that would boost theircost.</p><br /><p><u><b>Garden Way Carts</b></u><br /><br /> And finally, if a powered hauler is more than you can justify, getyourself a shiny, metal frame and brown stained, plywood box-bodiedGarden Way-style garden cart like you see in many rural andsuburban gardens. These carts were designed by Garden Way foundersEddie Robinson and Lyman Wood back in the 1940s; they took theirinspiration from the amazingly well-balanced, high-wheeled railwaystation baggage carts of the day. You may remember<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vermontcarts.com">GardenWay</a> carts from the magazine ads that compared theirlightweight, easy-dumping gardening convenience with a tippy,back-straining wheelbarrow. Perfectly balanced on easy-turning,rustproof, chrome-plated spoked wheels, a box cart will let youhaul bulky or heavy loads of all kinds over an acre or so offlatland. A word of caution: Don't overload them.</p><br /><h5 align="center">GARDENING TOOLS</h5><br /><p><b><u>A Heavy-duty Gardening Fork</u></b><br /><br /> Until you have been on your place long enough to improve thegarden soil with rich, crumbly compost and loose, friable sand,your best investment in a hand tool is a heavy, British-made,three- or four-tined garden fork or landscaper's fork. It shouldhave a stout, 40- to 44- inch ash or hickory handle shaft, asplit-shaft wooden 'D' grip and a green, flat-tined businesshand-forged from a single blank of carbon-manganese steel. Don'tconfuse this with the long-handled pitchfork designed forslip-pitching hay or straw. Granted, the garden fork is a bit of aninvestment, but it's well worth it - no other tool can do so much.The garden fork will dig through anything short of granite ledge;quarry well-striated, soft sandstone or limestone; lever up andremove field stones; turn and aerate wet compost and grub out themost stubborn tree roots. The multiple tines can penetrate soilthat would repel any full-bladed tool, from the toughest sod orpacked clay soil to (moistened) Southwestern hardpan, a good gardenfork will break it loose with a stern tug on the handle.</p><br /><p><u><b>A Heavy-duty Gardening Spade</b></u></p><br /><p>A companion to the fork is the spade. This thick, flat,rectangular-blade shovel was used in northern Europe to cut pearsfor fuel, and was later adopted by American frontiersmen forcutting prairie sods to build walls for homes and farm buildings. Asturdy spade will chop up the sod or clay dislodged by the fork.Together, spade and fork can be alternated to pry large rocks outof the soil and lever them up on a stoneboat or into loops oflogging chain to be skidded out by a tractor or team. Get a spadewith the top edge of one or both sides of the blade bent back at90° or fitted with a welded-on inch-wide strip of steel. This willsupport your boot when you step (or stomp) the blade into stubbornsoil.</p><br /><p>These traditional British gardener's tools may appear crudecompared with their more polished, mass-produced counterparts, butthey are beautiful in a rugged, utilitarian way. With respect anddutiful maintenance, they'll last a lifetime and be passed on to agrateful gardening son or daughter. The first of several lines tobe promoted in North America were Bulldog brand hand tools,developed 200 years ago by Cistercian monks and imported ageneration ago by the West Coast gardener's supply mail-ordercatalog, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smith-hawken.com">Smith and Hawken</a>. Smith andHawken's now has its own brand name on imported tools but theBulldog brand is still available from the heirloom seed company,<a target="_blank" href="http://www.seedsofchange.com">Seeds ofChange</a>.<br /><br /></p><br /><p><u><b>A Garden Rake</b></u></p><br /><p>Forget about the plastic or metal spring-tined leaf broom usedfor removing nature's autumnal debris; you'll need a wide,forged-steel, rigid-tined garden rake as described in<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lehmans.com">Lehman's</a>Non-Electric Catalog.</p><br /><p>This garden rake is heavy-headed and well-balanced, ensuringthat you needn't strain the small of your back or wrench themuscles in your arms and wrists bearing down on the handle to breakclods and rake rocks out of newly tilled garden soil to make asmooth and level planting bed.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>A Rear-tined Rotary Tiller</b></u></p><br /><p>Garden Way's big, red Troy-Bilt Horse tiller was the first bigseller; indeed Garden Way Manufacturing popularized the home gardenrear-tined tiller back in the 1960s and 70s. Though the old Horsehas been retired out to pasture, shaft-and-gear tillers are stillavailable in a whole stableful of equine-named models and powerranges. Country Home Products markets a similar design, while BCSAmerica sells a commercial-grade tiller built in Italy for localsmall-plot farmers and vintners. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcsamerica.com">BCS</a> walking tractors andtillers are equipped with commercial grade, American-built gasengines, so most common problems are readily fixed by any localsmall-engine mechanic.</p><br /><p>No other machine is as useful as a cast-iron, steel and bronze,rear-tined tiller when it comes to breaking up garden-size plots ofmeadow or backyard lawn sod. A good tiller will almost effortlesslyaccomplish spring and fall soil preparation, and is essential forthe organic gardener who wants to incorporate sand, manure,compost, leaves and other natural soil enhancers into theland.<br /><br /></p><br /><h5 align="center">CARPENTRY AND WOODWORKING<br /><br /></h5><br /><p><u><b>A Cordless Drill Driver</b></u></p><br /><p>Once limited to six or seven-and-a-half volts, these cordlessscrewdrivers now come in 22 volts or higher, relative to size andweight. We still relegate heavy rotary-tool jobs to power drills,but get as big and heavy a cordless drill as you can afford andphysically manage. You'll also want several Phillips-head orsquare-head drive bits and a variety of stainless and blue-steel,self-tapping deck screws. These deck screws, incidentally, arereplacing nails in all phases of wood construction - they go instraight, fast and effortlessly and hold forever, but are easy toextract if necessary.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>A Circular Utility Saw</b></u></p><br /><p>Get a conventional, 112-volt circular saw with a seven-inch orlarger blade for zipping through framing lumber. Skilsaw is thebrand name for this tool that is second only to a framing hammer intools most often used by house carpenters. Saws from any familiartool manufacturer, however, will cut just as well and for just aslong. For rough carpentry and demolition, get a supply of stampedblue-steel, non-resharpenable blades that will work for a longtime, then go to the recycling dump. These blades are cheap andwon't bankrupt you if they hit a nail. For precision cutting,invest in expensive, resharpenable carbide-tipped blades - and lookfor nails before you cut. For heavier jobs, you may want to investin a ball bearing-equipped, worm-drive circular saw. This piece ofequipment is heavy and awkward, and managing it requires bothhands. It's also rather slow, but with the proper blade andlubricant, this saw will cut through anything, including concreteand bar steel. Expect to pay in excess of $125.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>A Circular Detail Saw</b></u></p><br /><p>A lightweight, high-speed, cordless circular saw, such as<a target="_blank" href="http://www.makita.com">Makita's</a>sausage-shaped, three-inch blade model, is well-suited to a widevariety of household cutting jobs and is the power cutting tool youwill use most often. It's perfect for cutting through thin plywood,finish trim and soft metal or plastic sheeting. The circular detailsaw comes in a carrying case with a battery or two and plug-incharger that can draw energy from your house current or truck'sbattery. Get extra batteries if you plan to work for more than anhour at a time. Once your house is framed and roofed, you canfinish, wire and plumb most of it using this little dandy and aflat-jawed vise on a sawhorse to hold the work. If you're going tobe working with long boards, plumbing pipe or lengths of electricalconduit, fit a second sawhorse with a vise to hold the materials inplace.</p><br /><div align="center"><br /><h5>ELECTRICITY AND WIRING</h5><br /></div><br /><p><u><b>A Simple Volt/Am Meter</b></u></p><br /><p>This handheld meter features several ranges to measure thestrength (voltage) and current flow (amperage) of high and lowpower, AC and DC electricity. It also displays the resistance tocurrent flow (in ohms) of various electronic parts and materials.You can choose from two styles: a cheaper model with analog needleand dial, or a digital model. The analog model is easier tounderstand for those who are not products of the high-tech, digitalera. Either way, this gizmo can literally be a lifesaver by tellingyou how much current is on plus a great deal more. If you are newto do-it-yourself electrical work, make sure your volt/am metercomes with an instruction book. You can find this item at any RadioShack.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Fasteners and Wire</b></u></p><br /><p>If your home is a substantial distance from the nearest hardwarestore, you can easily lose the meat of a workday driving to town topurchase the little piece of wire or fastener necessary for a safe,secure connection. Stock up on a collection of wire and fastenersany way you see fit - We like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.harborfreight.com">Harbor Freight</a> and otherdiscount tool catalogs. You'll want to store an assortment oftwist-on electrical fasteners and reels, and spools or boxed coilsof wire from fine generator wrap up to three-conductor, insulated10-gauge household wiring. You'll find that you'll use it all intime - most popular sizes first. Just remember, if you lack thecorrect size, use the next-larger size for safety's sake.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Good Pliers</b></u></p><br /><p>Remember those rickety metal pliers that rattled loose on a bolthead? Scrap 'em. Get yourself two pairs of electrician's plierswith wire-stripper notches and plastic grip coverings. Made fromunplated, machine-tooled steel, these quality pliers have concealedhinges, and grasp with precision. Be sure to look out for theunderside of your middle finger; it can get badly squashed betweenthe handles.<br /><br /></p><br /><h5 align="center">AUTO AND MACHINE REPAIR</h5><br /><p><br /><u><b>Air Compressor</b></u></p><br /><p>A gasoline- or current-powered air compressor and a kit of themost commonly needed air tools (socket wrench, rotary impactwrench, screwdriver, die tool, spray gun, tire inflator, blower andothers) will keep you going strong. An air compressor will powerair tools and spray painting guns, and it's indispensable on thosesnowy mornings when you find a flat truck tire. As with any tool,get the most capable compressor you can afford. Look through thetool catalogs and check the operating pressure and airflowrequirements of the tools you think you'll need. A compressor thatcan deliver seven cubic feet of air at 90 pounds per square inchwill operate nearly any tool. It will even power up an air-hungryimpact wrench to deliver more than 1,300 pounds of pressure toremove rusted-on lugnuts from an old tractor (be sure to usespecial black steel, impact sockets and plenty of penetrating oilon rusted parts).</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Mechanic's Hand Tools</b></u></p><br /><p>However long it takes to acquire them, you should treat yourselfto complete sets of top-quality pliers and screwdrivers, open andbox wrenches, and ratchet handles and extensions (plus bothstandard and deep sockets) in SAE and metric sizes. You'll want arange from 1/64' to at least 1 1/2'. Get extras of themost-frequently used - thus, most frequently lost - socket sizes(1/4', 3/8', 1/2', and 5/8' and their metric equivalents). Buy agood rolling steel tool chest to hold them and the other tools youwill accumulate over time. Good tools (like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sears.com">Sears Craftsman</a> or the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.snapon.com">Snap-On</a> trucktools sold in any auto-parts store) are expensive, but it is falseeconomy to waste money on cheap tools. Their soft, impreciseworking surfaces will bruise corners of nuts, strip threads and getyour knuckles skinned. You can save some money by purchasing yourtools in sets and by holding out for special offers; check the backof Sears' sales flyers.<br /><br /></p><br /><h5 align="center">LIVESTOCK<br /><br /></h5><br /><p><b><u>The Merck Veterinary Manual</u></b></p><br /><p>This 2,305-page directory of symptoms, causes and treatments forall diseases of domestic livestock is a real bargain. Also, get theFarm and Ranch Supplies Catalog from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nascofa.com">NASCO</a>. This free catalog containsantibiotics, worming medication, syringes, bolus (huge pill)shooters, calf-pullers, simple surgical instruments, sutures,needles and any other veterinary devices the homesteader should trybefore calling a professional. Be sure to stock up on tins of BagBalm medicated petroleum ointment and dauber-topped jugs of gentianviolet antifungal wound dressing.</p><br /><p><br /></p><br /><h5 align="center">FENCES<br /><br /></h5><br /><p><u><b>Clamshell Post-hole Digger</b></u></p><br /><p>If you plan on sinking fence posts, you'll want one of these.Resembling a set of giant pliers, the clamshell post-hole digger isessential for sinking wooden fence posts deep enough to stay.Posthole diggers have four- or five-foot-long handles of wood orplastic and jaws shaped like opposing spoons. To dig a post-hole,you close the handles and use them to sink the closed jaws into theground. Then, open the handles out wide to make the jaws take abite of sod, soil or stone. Pick up the loaded tool (handles heldwide open so jaws remain closed - an awkward stance) and close thehandles. This will open the jaws to dump the bite of spoil intoyour garden cart.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Come-along and Wire Fence Mandrel</b></u></p><br /><p>The come-along is a hand-operated fence stretcher with aratchet/winch. The winch reels up a steel cable to pull on themandrel. (The mandrel fits over the loose end of a length of wirefence already attached to a well-set corner or line post.) You canbuy a wire fence mandrel or make your own to match the spacing ofyour fence wires by setting bolts through a length of steel or hardwood.</p><br /><p>A three- to five-ton come-along will also winch your truck outof the mud, hoist a steer for skinning, or persuade a felled treeto land correctly.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Fencing Pliers</b></u></p><br /><p>This may be the most vicious-looking tool in existence: a set oflong-handled pliers with a pickax on the working end and asharp-grooved hammer face for banging big fence staples into woodenposts. There is also a pointed pick opposite the hammer end forremoving the aforementioned staples.</p><br /><p>In addition, there are several holes, clamps and crimpers tocut, bend, splice and swage fence wire ranging from single-strandaluminum electric fence to 10-gauge, spring-crimped Cyclone bullfence. If you find this tool lacking, there is also a long-handledversion available. You can acquire fencing pliers from the farmsupply and homesteaders catalogs or from your local farmers'coop.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2001_April_May/Top_20_Homesteading_Tools">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /><br /><br /><h5 align="center">HEAVY-DUTY TOOLS</h5><br /></div><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>A Perfect Homestead Tractor</i> by GeorgeDeVault, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> April/May 2002<br /><br /></h4><br /><p>Inexpensive and reliable, these sturdy old gray tractors canstill get the job done.</p><br /><p>What kind of guarantee comes with this?'

Food production and distribution in theindustrialized world have become so dependent on petroleum use,it's hard to imagine how agriculture will function without thisfuel.</p><br /><p>The most promising option is solar-powered electric tractors,which offer several advantages over gas diesel-powered tractors.Electric motors can operate at more than 90 percent efficiency,while combustion engines are less than 15 percent efficient.Electric propulsion is ideally suited to high torque, slow-speedagricultural operations. Electric motors have only one moving partand require little maintenance. Internal combustion engines, on theother hand, have hundreds of moving parts and require a lot ofmaintenance.</p><br /><p>Electric motors don't idle, which saves energy. Plus, while thevehicle is going downhill or braking, an electric motor can becomea generator and return energy to the battery. This process, calledregenerative braking, further increases the efficiency of electricpropulsion and cannot be duplicated using other technologies.Electric-wheel motors eliminate the need for an internal combustionengine, transmission and differential, allowing new options in thedesign of tractors.

Thenew ones handle as well as a car, making them suited to anyoneregardless of physical abilities.'</p><br /><p>The ATV was orginally designed for transportation, and was firstintroduced in the early 1960s. Models had only three wheels, wereunstable on rough terrain and not suited to heavy work. But in1984, when the first four- and six-wheelers hit the ground, it wasobvious that the heavy work of farming, gardening and forestrycould be made a lot easier. Most of the new machines have enginedisplacements of 250 to 700 cubic centimeters (cc), can pull a loadof up to half a ton and reach speeds of up to 50 mph. In addition,the many attachments that can be added to the front and back of anATV allow it to be a multiuse utility vehicle. Prices range from$2,700 to $10,000, depending on engine size, number of wheels,four-wheel-drive capability and accessories.</p><br /><br /><p>The most valuable labor-saving ATV activity is hauling. Severalnew models, notably the John Deere Gator and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kawasaki.com">Kawasaki's</a> Mule have dump boxeslocated behind the driver's seat. They are both well suited to thehomestead, built for work and should last a long time.</p><br /><p>For ATVs without dump beds, trailers can be pulled behind themachine. Simply attach a trailer ball to the ATV's back hitch andyour powerful machine becomes a hauling wonder. Bulky itemsincluding lumber, compost, straw or soil can be carried with ease.It won't be long before your overworked wheelbarrow will begathering rust. The popular lawn trailer and garden-sized trailerswork well for backyard garden jobs, but a full-size ATV trailerallows you to handle bigger projects.</p><br /><p>'Special trailers are designed for ATVs that are similar inwidth to the ATV, making it easy to drive through tight places,'says Honda dealer Jeff Van der Veer of Napanee, Ontario. 'You canput the ATV on the trailer and tow it behind a truck to a rough orroadless work site, then attach the trailer to the ATV.'</p><br /><p>Collecting firewood is a whole lot easier with an ATV andtrailer. You can pile your chainsaw, gas and tools in the trailerand drive right to the dead wood that needs cutting. You can cutand split the wood on-site, load the trailer and then head to thewoodshed. Since ATVs are fun to drive, recruiting a teenager tohelp with woodcutting isn't difficult either. (As fun as they areto drive, ATVs are not toys. For safe operation, manufacturersrecommend an operator be at least 16 years old.)</p><br /><p>The other firewood option is to haul the logs to the woodshedand cut and split there. Several companies manufacture ATVattachments to aid in moving logs safely and with minimalenvironmental damage. The Novajack Company makes a hauling harnesscalled a logging arch that lifts up the front end of the log so youcan pull it behind the ATV. They also make logging trailers thatcan haul loads. A slightly different logging arch, manufactured by<a target="_blank" href="http://www.futureforestry.com">FutureForestry</a>, is a cross between the arch and a trailer. Its designallows more of the log to be lifted off the ground, reducing dragand embedded dirt on the logs to a minimum.</p><br /><p>ATVs make towing a wood splitter to the pile of logs you skiddedup to the woodshed easy. Logs that will be sawn into lumber can heset aside. Later, you can use your ATV to tow a portable sawmill tothe pile. When sawn, the lumber can be loaded onto the trailer andhauled anywhere you like.</p><br /><p>To make wood-chip mulch, tow a chipper to the brush pile youleft in the woods and blow the chips right into the trailer. We usea few boards standing upright in the back of the trailer for thechips to hit as they come out of the machine. They fall right intothe trailer. It's a simple matter to tow the load of mulch to thegardens.</p><br /><p>While we're still on the subject of firewood and logging, thereis another attachment that comes in very handy from time to time: apower winch. Smaller than the 5- to 10-ton capacity of trackwinches, most ATV winches are rated between 1,500 to 2,000 poundsand can be mounted on the front or rear of the machine.</p><br /><p>A downed tree, off the trail and inaccessible to the ATV, can hewinched, pulled to the trail and then hooked up to be towed.Inevitably the hardworking ATV will get stuck in the mud, and thewinch can be used to pull it out. Simply attach the winch cable tothe base of a tree, turn on the winch and out you'll come. Thewinch also can be used to pull cars stuck in the snow ormud.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2003_April_May/All_Terrain_Utility_Vehicles">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /></div><br /></div><br /><h3>ATV Sources:<br /></h3><br /><p>Arctic Cat<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.arcticcat.com">www.arcticcat.com</a></p><br /><p>Argo<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.argoatv.com">www.argoatv.com</a></p><br /><p>Bombardier<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bombardier-atv.com">www.bombardier-atv.com</a></p><br /><p>Gorilla Vehicles<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gorillavehicles.com">www.gorillavehicles.com</a></p><br /><p>Honda<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://Hondamotorcycles.com">Hondamotorcycles.com</a></p><br /><p>John Deere<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.johndeere.com">www.johndeere.com</a></p><br /><p>Kawasaki<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://kawasaki.com">kawasaki.com</a></p><br /><p>MAX All-Terrain Vehicles<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://maxatvs.com">maxatvs.com</a></p><br /><p>Polaris<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.Polarisindustries.com">www.Polarisindustries.com</a></p><br /><p>Suzuki<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://Suzukicycles.com">Suzukicycles.com</a></p><br /><p>Yamaha<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://Yamaha-motor.com">Yamaha-motor.com<br /></a></p><br /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://Yamaha-motor.com"><br /></a></p><br /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://Yamaha-motor.com"><br /></a></p><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>Choosing the Right Sawmill</i> by BrookElliot, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> December/January 2003 and Profitwith Portable Sawmills by ???, <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> December/January2003<br /></h4><br />Are you dreaming of a new home or barn you can't quite afford. Ifyou cut your own lumber using a portable sawmill, you could saveenough to bring the project within reach. And you can use the millto develop a business custom-cutting lumber or producing other woodproducts. Even if you don't have your own forest, you can salvagestorm-damaged trees or harvest trees being removed for constructionor farming.<br /><br /><p>Portable sawmills fall into three general categories: chainsawmills, circular sawmills and band sawmills. They are available in adiversity of styles and operating systems, and are priced to fitany budget. 'Which to pick,' says Will Johnson, president of<a target="_blank" href="http://www.timberking.com">TimberKing</a>,a portable sawmill manufacturing company, 'depends on what you aregoing to do with it.'</p><br /><p>The variables, he says, are how much lumber you plan to saw andhow quickly you need to cut it. A third variable is how finelyfinished you need the boards to he. Here are the pros and cons ofeach type of mill:</p><br /><h3>Chainsaw Mills</h3><br /><p>From a cost standpoint, chainsaw mills are inexpensive, and arethus appealing for homestead and farm use. Prices start under $100.But these mills are relatively slow, which means you can use themfor major projects only if you have lots of time. Even with thespecial chains used for lumbering, they still make rough cuts;further milling is required for finished surfaces.</p><br /><p>And they waste a lot of wood. 'Generally,' says Erin Domagalskiof <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hud-son.com">Hud-Son ForestEquipment</a>, 'a chainsaw mill has 20 percent more kerf (width ofthe blade cut) than a band sawmill.'</p><br /><p>Most chainsaw mills require heavy-duty power heads. Your currentchainsaw may not he powerful enough to run it, and a new chainsaw -which can double the cost - may be needed. Special-purpose chainsand bars are required as well.</p><br /><p>Most chainsaw mills are used with a framework you constructaround the log you are cutting, which can he a slow, awkwardprocess. Lining up the first cut is particularly important withthese mills, because that surface acts as a guide for the rest ofyour cuts. The Alaskan Mark III from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.granberg.com">Granberg International</a> is a goodexample of this type of chainsaw mill. Exceptions, such as theTotal J100 (available through Tilton Equipment Co.), consist of arail-and-stand system in which the log is held by base stands andthe saw rides upside down on the rails.</p><br /><h3>Circular Sawmills</h3><br /><p>At one time, all sawmills used circular blades. Most largercommercial operations still do. Their primary benefit is speed.Circular saws cut much faster than band saw's, but the downsidesare that they are expensive and they usually have a larger kerf, sothey waste more wood. The quality of the cut tends to be on therough side.</p><br /><p>Circular sawmills tend to be transportable, but not portable.They can take as much as a full day to erect once moved to the worksite. And most times a crew of three to five people is needed tooperate one efficiently and safely.</p><br /><p>Older circular sawmills work with a vertical blade mounted inthe bottom of the bed, similar to a workshop table saw. Modern onesposition the blade overhead, with safety guards, like a radial armsaw. A good representative is the Mighty Mite 'D' series sawmills,which are priced starting at $29,500.</p><br /><p>A novel approach is the Lucas Mill, an Australian designimported by Bailey's, which uses a special five-tooth, thin kerfblade mounted horizontally to cut logs that sit on the groundinstead of laying on a bed.</p><br /><h3>Band Sawmills</h3><br /><p>Today's portable sawmill industry is dominated by bandmills.Technology has made them available in such an array ofconfigurations and operating systems that they've almost displacedcircular sawmills.</p><br /><p>Although slower than circular sawmills, bandmills are trulyportable either with an integral trailer system, or inside a pickuptruck. They are simple and safe to operate; produce less wastebecause of a smaller kerf; create smoother surfaces, requiring lessmilling; and are flexible enough to cut specialty lumber, such asshakes, shingles and clapboards. And they are much more affordable,starting around $3,500.</p><br /><p>Depending on your needs, they come configured as small, manuallyoperated mills; as mid-sized units with power heads and basichydraulics; and as industrial strength mills, with power heads,built-in debarkers, hydraulic log-handling systems and computerizednetworks.</p><br /><p>When choosing a bandmill, the one thing you don't have to worryabout is its cutting quality. Virtually all modern bandmillsproduce the same high-quality surfaces, requiring little finalfinish work. Configuration and cutting speed are the two importantvariables within each class.</p><br /><p>However, don't pay much attention to manufacturers' claimedproduction speeds, says TimberKing's Will Johnson. 'Productivitynumbers are almost meaningless,' he says. 'There are just too manyvariables-including log size, lumber thickness and how fast theoperator can work-to provide realistic production figures.'</p><br /><p>Decide whether or not you really need the particular bells andwhistles on any given model. While full hydraulics are helpful, forinstance, they can push the price up to $30,000 very quickly.</p><br /><p>Manual bandmills come with either ground-level or elevated beds.Ground-level beds usually are found on mills that are transportedby truck. Log handling is a lot easier with them, but there may bemore operator fatigue from constant bending. Elevated-bed millsusually are transported by trailer, and are easier to operate. Butlog handling is more of a bother, requiring ramps, lifts oradditional equipment.</p><br /><p>Manual bandmills can be used for commercial cutting, but areconsidered best for personal use on farms and small acreage's.</p><br /><p>A step up from manual mills are those with automaticcarriage-feed systems and, in some cases, automatic setworks. Mostdo not include log-handling hydraulics. These mills are a lot lesslabor intensive, and are good for custom sawing. They also are agood option for those with physical limitations, or for jobsrequiring a lot of cutting in a short time period.</p><br /><p>Bandmills in the middle price range include hydraulic logloading, turning, clamping, and, in some cases, hydraulic toeboards. They are considered ideal for custom-cutting andproduction.</p><br /><p>At the top of the line are the high production bandmills. Thesecome with complete hydraulic and electronic operations for greaterproduction, custom sawing and commercial lumber manufacturing.</p><br /><p>When you're considering purchasing a sawmill, part of yourdecision should include what necessary accessories, such aslog-handling equipment, you might need. If you can do the job withcant hoops and peavey poles, then a manual mill might meet all yourrequirements. But if you want to cut bigger logs that require aseparate log lifter, then a hydraulic mill might make bettersense.</p><br /><p><b>Bandmill Sources:</b></p><br /><p>Baker Products<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.baker-online.com">www.baker-online.com</a></p><br /><p>Cook's Sawmill Manufacturing<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cookssaw.com">www.cookssaw.com</a></p><br /><p>Dave's Welding (Timber Grizz)</p><br /><p>Hud-Son Forest Equipment<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hudsonequipment.com">www.hudsonequipment.com</a></p><br /><p>Linn Lumber Mills<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://linnlumber.com">linnlumber.com</a></p><br /><p>Log-Master<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.logmaster.com">www.logmaster.com</a></p><br /><p>Mighty Mite<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mightymitesawmills.com">www.mightymitesawmills.com</a></p><br /><p>Norwood Ind.

We askedBrian Grodner, co-owner of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sawmillexchange.com">The Sawmill Exchange</a>, thelargest broker of used sawmills in the country, for his thoughts.Grodner has no dog in this fight, so his comments are worthlistening to. Among the things he says to consider:</p><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Ask the owners! Never buy a portable sawmill without firstconferring with sawmill owners. They are your absolute best sourcefor factual, honest information on how you can expect a brand andmodel to perform.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Consider income. Will you use the mill full time or part time?Will the mill provide all or part of your income?</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p><br /></p><br /><h3>Hybrid Sawmills</h3><br /><p>Not every portable sawmill readily fits into one category oranother. Hybrid sawmills combine parts and functions of severalcategories. There are two of particular note:</p><br /><p><b>Logosol's M7 Swedish Mill:</b> the chainmill that thinks it'sa bandmill. At first glance, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.logosol.com">Swedish Mill</a> looks like abandmill. It uses an adjustable log bed, power-head rail, logdogs(clamps that hold the logs in place) and an overhead support arm,like all bandmills. But the power head is a chainsaw.</p><br /><p>Not any chainsaw will work with it, however. Logosol recommendsthe Husqvarna 395XP, which generates 7.1 horsepower. Along with theheavy-duty power head, a special bar and low-profile chain producea 1/4-inch kerf, about the same as a band saw. The final finish issaid to be equal to a band blade as well. Bars are available in 16-,20- and 25-inch cutting lengths.</p><br /><p><b>Better-Built's Ripsaw:</b> the bandmill that thinks it's achainmill. Imagine lifting the entire power head and blade supportoff a bandmill, then building a cutting guide around a log (as youwould with a chainmill), and hand-feeding the band saw into thelog. In a nutshell, that's the RipSaw.</p><br /><p>The Ripsaw comes in two versions. One has its engine. The otheris a conversion kit that lets you turn your chainsaw into abandmill in about 10 minutes. According to the manufacturer, youcan use the chainsaw to fell trees, then install the conversion kitand turn those trees into finished lumber.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2002_December_January/Choosing_the_Right_Sawmill">READ THE FULL STORY<br /><br /></a></div><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>Electric Fencing</i> by George Devault,<i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> August/September 2003<br /><br /></h4><br /><p align="center"><i>The easy way to keep your livestock in andpredators out.</i></p><br /><p>In recent years, electric fencing innovations haverevolutionized some forms of livestock grazing and protection, andgarden crop protection, too.</p><br /><p>Now, effective and relatively inexpensive temporary electricfencing is available to protect everything from small animals suchas chickens in the barnyard or pasture to larger animals such asriding horses out for weekend trail rides or involved in stripgrazing.</p><br /><p>Although some electric fences are considered permanent, muchlike a traditionally built fence, other styles are intended forsemi-permanent or temporary applications, giving users moreflexibility and economy in meeting such fencing needs than they'veever had in the past. Modern temporary styles of electric fencinginclude the familiar rope line fence, some tape fence styles andvarious sizes of mesh netting; all can be set up or taken down in amatter of minutes.</p><br /><p>Pennsylvania farmer Brian Moyer pastures 1,400 broilersannually, using 42-inch-high electric netting with 31/2-inch-squareopenings and plastic posts. Moyer says he especially likes theheavy-plastic, step-in posts, which he just pushes into the groundwith his foot (or in dry times, hammers in with a rubbermallet.)</p><br /><p>The portability of temporary electric fencing means it can bemoved about according to pre-planned grazing patterns. The practiceallows more intensive use of pasturelands than is possible withpermanent fencing of larger areas. Aaron Silverman raises about15,000 broilers a year in a small valley in Oregon. 'Our fields arebordered by riparian zones - a river or a creek where there arenesting marsh hawks and red-tailed hawks, bobcat runs and coyotetrails.</p><br /><p>'When we started with traditional pastured poultry zones, weconfined the birds to the portable enclosures at all times andmoved the enclosures once, maybe twice a day. We noticed thatwhenever we were close to a riparian zone, we would lose birds toraccoons, 'possums and skunks, which were able to sneak under thefencing.'</p><br /><p>To establish secure outdoor pens for the birds, Silverman testedelectric sheep netting, with mesh small enough to stop coyotes, butnot weasels, 'so we were still losing birds.' Next, he triedelectric poultry netting with 2-by-3-inch openings and thin,rigid-plastic verticals that keep the fence upright without cornertension braces.</p><br /><p>'That pretty much took care of it,' he says. The netted fencekeeps out predators as small as rats - as long as it's movedregularly. When left in place for several weeks, such as around agreenhouse-turned-brooder house, rats eventually tunnel underneathto get at the chickens. 'In the field,' he says, 'where we aremoving the fence on a continual basis, they (the rats) respectit.'</p><br /><p>Permanent and semi-permanent electric fencing are most effectivein applications involving large livestock.

Finding your own home-business niche can make theprospect of homesteading more attractive and realistic.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Adapted from <i>Grow Trees for Pleasure and Profit</i>, by HansMorsbach, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> October/November 2004</h4><br /><p>In 1972, I knew nothing about farming; I was just a smallbusinessman from Chicago with no spare time. But, I ended up buyinga farm in Richland County, Wis., from a friend, and tried raisingcattle on the land, then bees. But these didn't suit me. So, whenthe county forester proposed that I start a tree farm, I wasecstatic. Over the next 20 years, I learned by experience the joys- and work - of creating a forest. My ideas of forest managementare based on using it as a long-term investment strategy and a wayto have fun.</p><br /><p>To reduce forest stewardship to its barest essentials, all youneed is a piece of land. Let's say you have a half-acre of land ina part of the country where trees grow. In a matter of a fewdecades, the land will revert to forest if you leave it alone. Butif you have an acre of land, or more, you can speed the forestationprocess along. And, not much is required: Gather seeds, disturb theearth - dig it, rototill it, plow it - and sow away. You needn'tfeel you don't have the time, the money or the know-how to create awoodland for your own enjoyment. It's an avocation that suits anyschedule, fortune or inclination.</p><br /><p>Before you start, think about these '10 Commandments,' thingsI've learned that have made owning a woodland a rewardingexperience:</p><br /><h3>1. ENJOY YOUR WOODLAND</h3><br /><p>Your woodland should be a source of pleasure and joy. Sounds,animal activity and interesting vegetation are everywhere. Letnothing interfere with the enjoyment of your forest.</p><br /><h3>2. BUY LOCAL LAND</h3><br /><p>One key to enjoying your woodland is buying land that is quickand easy to get to. Buying land nearer to 'civilization' also makesgood investment sense, because it is more likely to appreciate invalue than land located far away from populated areas.</p><br /><p>On the other hand, if you live in a sprawling metropolitan areaor a part of the country where the landscape is boring, you maydecide a longer drive is worth it. Regardless of location, realestate should appreciate roughly on par with alternativeinvestments.</p><br /><h3>3. DON'T EXPECT TO MAKE MONEY</h3><br /><p>At least not in the short term. It is unlikely that you'll seemuch profit from cultivating trees for hardwood veneers. Sure, atimber sale from sought-after trees, such as walnuts, can bring awindfall, but hardwood trees take about a century to reachmaturity. Considered over the long run, your rate of return is muchless than you would get from buying a certificate of deposit andthere won't be any regular cash flow. There may be money inpracticing short-rotation forestry, such as growing pines for pulp,but this sort of tree farming is not friendly to nature, not niceto look at and not any fun.</p><br /><p>If return on your investment is what you're after, place yourhopes in appreciating land values rather then profitable timbersales.</p><br /><h3>4. DON'T BUY MORE LAND THAN YOU CAN MANAGE</h3><br /><p>Your pleasure is more likely to come from observing and workingyour forest than from its size.</p><br /><h3>5. DON'T EXPEND TOO MUCH TIME, EFFORT OR MONEY ON YOURTREES</h3><br /><p>Small-scale forestry is a poor business, but personally veryenriching. Only do it to the extent that it gives you pleasurewhile you work the land and walk among your trees.</p><br /><h3>6. BE KIND TO THE ENVIRONMENT</h3><br /><p>Doing nothing is one way to be kind to your small woodland. Thismeans do not clear-cut, do not use chemicals and minimize the useof your lawn mower. (You will soon observe that in the country, atract of land in its natural state is much more interesting and alot less work than a manicured lawn.) If you want to activelybenefit the environment, eliminate nonnative species, encouragetrees that provide food and shelter for wildlife, and allow oldtrees to recycle themselves. (See 'The Life in Dead Trees,'<i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> August/September 2004.)</p><br /><h3>7. CONSULT FORESTRY EXPERTS - BUT REMEMBER WHO'S BOSS</h3><br /><p>No matter the size of your land, you can improve it withforestry. As a starting point, I suggest you contact a foresterthrough your state's Department of Natural Resources. Such aprofessional can provide useful literature, possibly prepare amanagement plan for your woodland and suggest certain managementpractices. He or she also can let you know whether your state hasany programs benefiting small woodland owners. If you participatein any government subsidies or other programs, you are bound tohonor your commitments. Follow foresters' advice, except when itconflicts with what you want to do, and follow your owninstincts.</p><br /><h3>8. FAVOR MARKETABLE TREES</h3><br /><p>You may not get rich growing trees for market, but you shouldstill favor trees that are most likely to have timber value in thefuture. You may either plant tree seeds directly in the soil, orplant seedlings and follow accepted forestry practices to make themmarketable. Follow the German Dauerwald philosophy that calls forgrowing timber in mixed forests of native species, unevenly aged,in a biodiverse environment with abundant wildlife.</p><br /><h3>9. REPRESS YOUR COMPULSIONS</h3><br /><p>Often, woodland owners apply their city values to their woodlanddealings. They think they have to mow, grind trimmed branches intotiny wood chips and eliminate natural ground vegetation. Rememberthat nature recycles more efficiently than you do and that the'waste' created by natural vegetation is essential to environmentalhealth.</p><br /><p>Another compulsion is to grow trees like row crops. Try to avoidthis; trees grow well in a natural environment together with allkinds of other vegetation. A plantation is boring, more work foryou and more prone to infestation and disease. If you do plantseedlings, mix the species up as much as you can. They will growbetter, foster more wildlife and be more enjoyable.</p><br /><h3>10. BE A GOOD CITIZEN AND ACTIVIST</h3><br /><p>Attend conferences of woodland owners' associations, which manystates host (visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.woodlandowners.org">www.woodlandowners.org</a>).They offer useful lectures and opportunities for vendors to selltheir wares. You will learn a great deal, and you will enjoymeeting others who share your interests. Contact the U.S. ForestService and your local Extension Service for information aboutsmall-woodland forestry. Make your land available as ademonstration site to help educate other, less-experienced woodlandowners.</p><br /><p>Become politically active. Encourage government to recognize theimportance of private woodland owners in preserving our naturalenvironment. Woodland owners play an important role in preservingpure water, preventing floods and maintaining the equilibrium ofour climate.

McGroarty, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i>October/November 2000</h4><br /><p>Growing plants for retail or wholesale is an interesting and funway to earn money involving the whole family. You don't need muchland (our backyard nursery is only 1/20 of an acre), you can growthousands of plants at a time, and you earn several thousanddollars a year ... working right at home.</p><br /><p>Starting a nursery in your back yard is probably easier than youthink. When most people think of a plant nursery,they visualizehuge greenhouses, tractors and other expensive equipment. The factis, as a backyard grower you don't need any of those things to getstarted. All you need is a small area to start growing some plantsand a little bit of information on landscape plant propagation.Thankfully, there are many simple and easy propagation techniquesthat are easy to learn and work really well.</p><br /><h3><br /> SELLING WHAT YOU GROW</h3><br /><p>Here in the far northeastern corner of Ohio we have more than100 nurseries, ranging in size from our 1/20 of an acre to muchlarger ones measuring 600 acres. Many of these nurseries werecalled 'lunchbox' nurseries, a term that dates from the early 1900swhen employees of one large wholesale nursery would smugglecuttings home in their lunch boxes to start their own backyardnurseries. Many of these startups grew into very productive andprofitable enterprises.</p><br /><p>When you're ready to sell the plants you grow, there are manydifferent ways to go about it. We grow most of our plants in smallcontainers and sell them for $4 each. It costs us about 23  cents toproduce one of these little plants, and most of that cost is theplastic container - the cost of the plant is next to nothing. Wespend $10 on sand, $20 on rooting compound, and can do 7,000cuttings or more with these materials, which brings the cost percutting to less than a penny. As close as I can figure, our costfor the potting soil is about 5  cents for a two-quart container.The cost of the plastic container is around 16  cents. A small ad inthe local paper brings in customers like crazy and, because we'relucky enough to live in a community that allows us to sell directlyfrom our home, we sell both wholesale and retail from our backyardnursery.</p><br /><p>If you can't do retail sales from home, you should still be ableto establish a wholesale business. Large nurseries spend thousandsof dollars each year buying plants they need. Some of them buyrooted cuttings while others buy landscape-size plants. Whateverthe case, they will buy from you if you offer good-quality plantsat fair prices.</p><br /><p>You could even have a backyard nursery specializing only inrooted cuttings. A four-inch cutting with roots has value on themarket, and there are wholesale buyers who purchase thousands ofthem at a time. Rooted cuttings sell for as little as 35  cents oras much as $1.25, depending on the variety. If you grow the plantsfor one year after they are rooted you can sell them wholesale asone-year transplants, which increases the price to $1.50 or more.There is a market for just about any size plant you choose to grow- and the market is larger than you could ever imagine.</p><br /><p>I have a friend who roots and sells grapevines as one- andtwo-year-old plants. At his 100-acre nursery they make over 500,000grapevine cuttings each winter, as well as tens of thousands offlowering shrub cuttings every summer. He grows about 100,000burning bush plants each year and sells them bare root, which ismuch easier and less expensive than wrapping up a root ball inburlap. After digging the plants up, they shake all the soil fromthe roots, tie them in bundles of ten, and stack them in aninsulated barn until it's time to load them on their customer'struck. The nursery's annual sales exceed 2 million dollars!</p><br /><p>That said, the backyard nursery business is not a get-rich-quickbusiness by any means. It takes many years to establish a largenursery. On the other hand, it's a project that you can start withvery little money and expand into a thriving home business. Infact, getting started is as easy as deciding what types of plantsyou would like to grow and acquiring a few that you can use asstock plants to get cuttings from. You'll also need a nursery stockproducer and/or vendor license from your state department ofagriculture. There is a small fee for the license, but you shouldcontact your county department of commerce for local regulationsand information.</p><br /><p>Also, you need to know that some plants are patented or are soldunder names that are registered trademarks. You cannot grow theseplants without entering into an agreement with the person orcompany that holds the right to them. Don't bother growing theseplants; there are plenty of others that you can grow without thehassles. When you go to buy them, just look for a patent number, or'patent pending' on the label or keep an eye out for the trademarksymbol (restricted). Lastly, make sure you know both the correct common nameand botanical name of the plants you intend to grow. You must havethem properly labeled in order to sell them. Good luck and havefun!</p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2000_October_November/Growing_Greenbacks">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /></div><br /><h4><br /></h4><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>A Minimum Investment, Maximum Profit HomeBusiness!</i> by Larry William Koontz, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i>July/August 1982</h4><br /><p>With vacationing pet owners searching for home-style animalcare, it's a good time to start your total-care dog and catbusiness.<br /></p><br /><p>A few years back I suddenly found myself without a job.

Small barns and outbuildings can be beautiful, elegant structures or simple,functional ones. They can house firewood, garden and yard tools,small animals, animal feed and other farm supplies. No matter whatyour specific needs are, your homestead will benefit from havingthese useful structures.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Excerpted from <i>Beautiful Barns</i> by Lynn Byczynski,<i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i> October/November 2004</h4><br /><p align="center"><i>Building a classic, functional barn can beeasier and more affordable than you think.</i></p><br /><p>Barns have long been a cherished part of the American landscapeas symbols of our agricultural heritage. Barns of the past spokevolumes about the farmers who built them: what types of crops andanimals they raised, which foreign land they once called home, andhow successful and prosperous they had been. But somewhere in thepast half-century, the art of the barn was lost. Instead ofbuilding barns that reflected regional and occupationaldifferences, many rural residents across America started erectingone-story, steel-clad buildings to house animals, crops, machinery,tools and vehicles. The era of beautiful barns seemed to have cometo an end.</p><br /><p>Today, though, there are signs of a barn-building renaissance.Several architects, designers and builders are selling plans andkits for traditional barns, and the Internet has made them widelyavailable. Proper use of scale, proportion and simple details canmimic the grace of old barns and make new barns more appealing. Ifa new barn is in your future, don't be afraid to expect more thanjust storage space. Building a barn that also looks great takeseffort, but the results will add to the value of your property andbe attractive, too.</p><br /><p>The best news is that many of these traditional-looking barnsare designed to be no more expensive, perhaps even less so, thanmetal buildings. 'A well-designed barn, using wood siding, can besurprisingly affordable. The price can be in the same range as anugly metal box if the owners are willing to get involved, even ifit only is to manage the building project, saving the cost of acontractor,' says Craig Wallin, author of <i>Small Barn Plans forOwner-Builders</i>.</p><br /><p>A few simple tricks can give new barns that classic feel.Z-braced barn doors and traditional window trim are the kinds offeatures that don't cost a lot but that can make a world ofdifference in the aesthetics of the building. Roofs are alsoimportant. 'Traditional barns were usually two or more floors, orat least a floor and a loft,' says small-barn designer Donald Berg,Rockville Centre, N.Y. 'It's the loft and the big roof that give abarn its character. Modern pole barns have shallow-truss roofs andno lofts. That gives them a flat, uninteresting look.'</p><br /><p>Wallin agrees the roof makes the barn: 'Features that make abarn attractive and traditional are a steeper pitched roof - atleast an 8:12 pitch (the roof inclines 8 inches for every 12 inchesof length), with generous overhangs.'</p><br /><p>Cupolas big enough to ventilate the barn are also classic barnfeatures. Farmers used to take pride in designing cupolas thatreflected their own individual style.</p><br /><p>Here are some suggestions for building a barn that istraditional in style and economical in price:<br /></p><br /><p><u><b>Size and Design</b></u></p><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Your first task is to decide how much square footage you reallyneed. Don't assume that bigger is better; small and efficient ismore economical to build, maintain and, possibly, heat. Also, asmaller barn might not interrupt a view and, if it is in scale withthe rest of your buildings, it probably will contribute to a morepleasing overall property design than a biggerstructure.<br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Measure everything you plan to keep in your new barn. If you'redesigning a workshop, for example, figure out how much space youneed for your tools and an efficient work space for yourself. Ifyour barn will house livestock, figure in adequate space for theanimals, too. A great advantage of building your own barn is thatyou can tailor it to fit your needs.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Next, start looking at barn designs. Your best resource is theInternet, where you will find many sites with plans or kits forsmall barns. Several books are also available with barn plans andinstructions.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>The type of construction you choose will depend on the barn'sstyle.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>The least expensive is the <b>pole barn</b>, now known as<b>post-frame construction</b>. Post-frame involves sinking postsinto the ground, then connecting them horizontally with lumber. Thepoles serve as foundation, bracing and framework, and no excavationis required other than digging holes for the poles. This is thetype of construction used for most metal buildings today. But itdoesn't have to be limited to shallow-pitched roofs and singlestories; two stories are possible, too.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Another type of construction is called <b>light-frame</b>. Itis is used in most residential construction. Frames of 'two-by'lumber (2-by-4, 2-by-6) are built and attached to a foundation.This type of construction costs more than post-frame because itrequires more lumber and a concrete foundation. Light-frame barnscan be any size.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>A third type of construction often used for barns is<b>post-and-beam</b>, also known as <b>timber frame</b> andrequiring long, strong timbers. Vertical posts and horizontal tiebeams are assembled into sections called bents, then raised andattached to a sill beam on a stone foundation. This is the sourceof the phrase 'barn raising.' Timber-frame barns are the mostexpensive type of construction because the timbers are hard to comeby, but several companies make kits you can assemble and raiseyourself, with the help of many friends or a crane. Timber-framebarns can be small or large.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /></li></ul><br /><br /><p><u><b><br /> Materials</b></u></p><br /><p>Choose your building materials with an eye towards aesthetics.Siding is the most obvious feature of the barn, and you can choosefrom wooden lap, wooden board and batten, composites such as T-111(a brand of plywood siding), fiber-cement lap or panels, steelpanels, or vinyl. 'I've used T-111, HardiPlank (a brand offiber-cement siding), rough sawn boards and even metal siding,'Berg says. 'Any and all can look good if they're on awell-proportioned barn.' The idea is to mimic the grace and styleof a classic barn as much as possible, without sacrificingfunctionality.</p><br /><p>Roofing materials need careful consideration, too. Metal roofsare common, but you also can use composite shingles to match yourhouse or wood shingles to mimic historic barn roofs.</p><br /><p>Doors and windows also will have significant impact on thecharacter of your barn. If you really want to stick with tradition,you can build your own barn doors, such as Z-braced Dutch doors orsliding doors, or you can purchase them from a horse-barn specialtymanufacturer. Specialized doors are more expensive thanmanufactured residential doors, though, so if you need to keep aneye on costs, stick with a door that's readily available.</p><br /><p>Historic barns usually have fixed or awning windows that eitherdon't open or that are hinged on the top or bottom and open onlyslightly. If you want to be able to open your new barn's windowsand keep the barn free of wasps, birds and other critters, you areprobably better off purchasing double-hung house windows withscreens.</p><br /><p><u><b><br /> Cupolas</b></u></p><br /><p>One of the most fetching features of an old barn is the cupola,often topped with a weather vane. Some companies that make metalbarns put small ornamental cupolas on the roofs, but a real cupolafunctions as a ventilator, drawing warm air upward and releasing itoutside.</p><br /><p>Functioning cupolas on historic barns were big because they hadto draw off the heat and moisture from a number of large animalsand hay. To keep that authentic look, be sure to get your cupola'sproportions correct. Berg, who has studied the proportions of oldbarns throughout the country, says a functioning cupola should bebuilt to a ratio of 1 1/4-to-1 1/2 inches for each foot of roofline; for example, a 24-foot barn needs a 36-inch-squarecupola.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Siting</b></u></p><br /><p>Site your barn carefully. A hallmark of many American farms isthat outbuildings are all placed exactly on the square, with wallsat right angles or parallel to each other, Berg says. That neatnessand symmetry is naturally appealing to the eye. If you want to varyfrom this, try not to put your barn too far away from your house orit won't be convenient, but don't upstage your house with the barn,either. Also, be sure to place your barn in convenient conjunctionwith drives, walkways and other outbuildings, and keep nature inmind by allowing for the growth of trees and the direction of waterrunoff on your property. Last but not least, don't forget toevaluate what you're doing to your view.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Build your Own</b></u><br /></p><br /><p>Experts say that you can save half the cost of a pole barn bydoing the work yourself. If you have some building skills, you'llfind a pole barn is a good place to hone them because you don'tneed every detail cosmetically perfect.</p><br /><p>Wallin says that, unless you have experience in construction,you will probably appreciate the help of a professional to buildthe foundation and shell of the barn, both of which are fairlymajor undertakings. Kits are available from several companies; youcan build one yourself or hire a local builder.</p><br /><p>Another option is to hire a builder who specializes in timberframing and who will be able to get trees milled locally intolumber for the project. That was the approach taken by Mark Cain ofHuntsville, Ark., who needed a barn for his flower and blueberryfarm. He hired a local timber framer and a neighbor with a sawmill,and they found enough big trees on his land to mill into the hugetimbers for the barn's frame, plus boards for the board-and-battensiding. Then, Mark staged an old-fashioned barn raising with 30people present to raise the first-floor timbers on his24-by-48-foot, two-story barn.</p><br /><p>Wind vents on the roof of this 1833 corn barn, built nearBernardston, Mass., were to prevent the roof from blowing off; theplan originated in England, where America's high winds were widelyreported.</p><br /><p><u><b><br /> Hiring a Builder</b></u><br /></p><br /><p>If you decide to use a builder, choose carefully. Getrecommendations from other people who have hired barn builders, andthen contact two or three, and ask them to bid on your project.Builders who specialize in truss-roof metal buildings are certainlycapable of building a custom barn. You may be surprised at the widerange of styles and custom design services available from nationalbarn companies that are best known for their metal pole barns.</p><br /><p>When you ask for bids on your building, be specific aboutmaterials and request that all siding, roofing, windows and doorsbe described. If possible, go to the building-supply yard yourselfto approve the materials the builder has quoted. Be sure thebuilder specifies how long it will take to build your barn,including a reasonable completion date. Be as specific as you canwhen going out to bid; you don't want to discover amiscommunication when the building is halfway built - that leads tocost overruns and bad feelings.</p><br /><p><br /><u><b>Prices</b></u></p><br /><p>That brings us to the question that is probably foremost in yourmind: How much will a new barn cost?</p><br /><p>That's a hard one to answer, because so many variables, fromlocation to materials, affect construction costs. If you want tobuild a barn at your rocky mountainside retreat in Colorado, youcould easily spend as much for site preparation as someone elsespends on an entire barn built on a rolling Iowa meadow. Still,most people find ballpark figures more helpful than no-parkfigures, so consider these barn-building examples:</p><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Wallin says one of his 1,872 square-foot barn designs was builtin 2003 for a materials cost of $18,000, or about $10 per squarefoot, which is a typical cost for other barns he's built. Doublethat if you hire a builder.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Berg says his barns cost on average $25 per square foot ofground-floor space (not including the loft) if built by acontractor.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>The barn we built last year cost $19,500 for a 768-square-footfootprint, or about $25 per square foot. Add in the storage spacein the loft, and the cost drops to about $16 per square foot.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><br /><p>Cain figures his barn, which is almost 2,300 square feet(including the second floor), cost about $20,000, or less than $9per square foot. He cut costs by using his own trees for timbersand siding; allowing timber framers to use his barn as ademonstration project, which reduced his labor costs; and havingfriends over for the barn raising.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p>Building a barn on your property doesn't have to be expensive ordifficult. And when you think of the benefits - beauty, increasedproperty value, functional work space and recreating a piece ofAmerican history - planning your barn can be a great investmentalong with just plain fun.</p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/2004_October_November/Beautiful_Barns">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /><br /><br /><div align="left"><br /><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div align="left">Excerpted from <i>Keep Backyard Chickens WithClass in MOTHER'S Mini-coop</i> by Steve Maxwell, <i>Mother EarthNews</i> February/March 2003<br /><br /><p>There are so many good reasons to keep chickens that even cityfolks really should have a few birds. But too many backyard chickenoperations look like something plucked out of a John Steinbecknovel, and that's a stumbling block for many. While thechicken-shack lifestyle is fine for some folks, the cause ofsustainable, small-scale food production will never make seriousheadway unless it is presented with a touch of class and style.That's the goal of MOTHER'S mini-coop, which makes it easy to keepa few hens even in the fanciest neighborhood or smallest backyard.</p><br /><p>Our design team sought the advice of several poultry experts inour quest to come up with a coop design that keeps the birds safeand productive, makes daily care as easy as possible, and looksgood enough to park on a front lawn in town. The mini-coop keepsthe birds safely fenced in, but can be easily moved around the yardand garden by just one person, so the birds can feed on fresh grassand bugs as much of the year as possible. The sheltered coop areais about 4x4-feet a perfect bedroom for three or four hens.

The family vacation is over-if notpaid for-the garden is tending itself, the fish have quit biting,and pro football hasn't yet kicked off. Weekends drag ... it's timeto find something to get you out of the house. What better projectthan building a shed to store your gear?</p><br /><p>In just such circumstances some years back, I responded to amagazine ad for a plan set that promised a pretty shed 'anyonecould build.' But the plan proved to be nothing but a single sheetof paper with a crude drawing, a materials list written inshorthand, and instructions that began 'Anchor sole plate ...'What's a sole plate? Don't ask me - the plan didn't say.</p><br /><br /><p>As luck would have it, our little country town took up recyclingthat year and I got to carry boards for a carpenter as he built usan open-fronted recycling shed. I still have a mind's-eye pictureof him with his deliberate but steady pace, measuring twice,cutting once, and then setting nails with a whack. Thus instructed,I built a scaled-down version of the recycling shed, closed in thefront, and made a woodplank door and sliding window. You can usethis shed to store garden tools or wood, to garage your lawntractor and attachments, to house a few goats, sheep, or chickens,or for a combination of uses. (Just be sure to put a dust-proofpartition between the laying hens and your work or storagearea.)</p><br /><p>The shed is a few inches short of 16' long, 8' high and deep.It's designed for mistake-proof construction, using economical,standard-size materials. But it is made to last, with ground-facingfloor beams of pressure-treated lumber to resist decay and insectdamage, and a frame more closely spaced than you'll find in manynew homes. The siding is T-1-11 plywood, which is weather-proofedand grooved on one side to simulate barn boards.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/1993_August_September/Backyard_Shed">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /><br /></div><br /><br /><br /> Excerpted from <i>A Timber-Frame Woodshed from Vermont HighCountry</i> by John Vivian, <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i>August/September 1995<br /><br /><p align="center"><i>Build a woodshed that will last 200years.</i></p><br /><p>The woodsheds that help make the evenings glow and crackle mustbe filled by local woodsmen as fast as they are emptied byvacationers, and they are marvelously designed for the use.

It even houses chickens and rabbits!</i></div><br /><p>Our new greenhouse does so many different things that it's beendifficult to figure out what to call it. Naming it by its separatefunctions could lead to a conglomeration such as this:compost-heat- and active-solar-heat-augmented, photovoltaic,earth-bermed, plant propagation and production rabbit hutch/chickencoop/terraced growing bed/runway greenhouse system. See what wemean? Let's compromise and use a term coined by the New AlchemyInstitute - <i>bioshelter</i>.</p><br /><p>The design of the structure was conceived in an attempt to getas many quality uses as possible out of one building by integratingit with its living occupants wherever possible. The goal, however,isn't so much to see how many interactions of plant, animal, andbuilding we can create as it is to develop the most effective ones.For example, in the back of the bioshelter is a small room wherechickens and rabbits can come in out of the weather. The solarinput helps keep the critters warm, while the animals themselvesadd their body heat to the building. More important, the structureof their home adds to the overall mass of the greenhouse. The fullybermed masonry walls help to stabilize interior temperature. Allthese factors (and more) work together to create a beneficialthermal environment.</p><br /><p>Despite the attention paid to creature comfort, the bioshelteris still primarily intended for plant production. And the key togetting the most from the greenhouse beds is to keep soiltemperature up - preferably in the 80°F range. (Up to a point,plants double their growth rate for each 10°F rise in soiltemperature.) Air temperature is less important as long as it'shigh enough to prevent leaves from freezing. Consequently, ourgrowing beds are heavily insulated on the sides, and the 10' ofmedium in each rests on a layer of rock through which warm air canbe circulated. The areas under the beds are sealed but areaccessible through hatches that allow us to experiment with severaldifferent supplemental heating methods, and we've borrowed ideasfrom a few other research organizations to pump warmth from thesechambers into the soil.</p><br /><p>First, we've taken a lesson from Rodale Press's <i>ResidentialPassive Solar Greenhouse</i> and are picking up hot air from theceiling and distributing it below the beds. A squirrel-cage blowerpowered by a Solarex photovoltaic panel hooked to a battery movesthe air around. The fan takes orders from a blower controlthermostat that switches it on when the temperature at the peakreaches 85° F and from a heating thermostat that turns it back offwhen the temperature drops to 75° F. There's also a manual overrideswitch we use to force air into the compost piles when necessaryfor maintaining decomposition.</p><br /><p>Rodale's greenhouse has rock under the beds to offer mass forheat storage; a system that seems to work quite well. However,we've followed the lead of the Biothermal Energy Center (P.O. Box3112, Portland, ME 04101) and the New Alchemy Institute and arecomposting various mixtures of organic matter in the bins beneathour beds. Though this technique is still in the experimental stage,it does have a number of both already-demonstrated and stilltheoretical benefits. The most obvious plus is that decomposingorganic matter produces a great deal of heat: Our compost pileshave reached 180° F and have maintained 160° F for more than a weekat a time. Furthermore, the same material also yields moisture,carbon dioxide, and nutrients, which rise through the rocks andinto the growing medium. These benefits are at least as effectiveas the heat input in increasing plant growth rate, but furtherexperimentation is needed to determine the optimum mix of organicmatter in the compost piles themselves.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Livestock_and_Farming/1986_July_August/Mother_s_Bioshelter_Greenhouse">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /></div><br /><br /><br /></div><br /></div><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div align="left"><br /><div align="center"><br /><h2><a name="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Food_" id="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Food_"></a>Homesteading andSelf-reliance: Food Production & Preservation<br /></h2><br /><div align="left"><br /><h3><br /> Producing Your Own Food</h3><br />One of the most essential steps in learning to rely on oneself islearning how to produce and preserve your own food.

I suspect that at the timesome of my colleagues thought I'd fall prey to the same oldnine-to-five routine that I'd been encouraging <i>Mother EarthNews</i> readers to leave - but happily, that hasn't proved to bethe case. Today, my husband, Jim, and I are living the kind ofsimple life that I had time only to write and dream about as a<i>Mother Earth Ne</i><i>ws</i> editor. And we're doing it in theunlikely setting of a city of 250,000 people on Florida's denselypopulated Gulf Coast.</p><br /><p>When I first arrived in the land of opulent condos andmushrooming mobile home parks, I was pretty wet behind the ears andloaded with the usual misconceptions about this much-malignedstate. Jim, patient fellow that he is, took me under his spousalwing and immediately began my education in urban homesteading,Florida-style. He had moved into his modest urban bungalow eightyears earlier and had single-handedly turned the rather plainlittle spread into a veritable oasis. The backyard, once a sandy,sun-scorched parking area (complete with broken concrete chips andlayers of coquina shells), had been transformed into two largeorganic gardens partially shaded by citrus trees. Jim had replacedthe crabgrass 'lawn' with heat-resistant St. Augustine turf andsoftened the stark outlines of the house by planting a colorfullandscape of native tropicals.</p><br /><p>Inside the bungalow, he had laid new kitchen linoleum ...installed ceiling fans ... sanded and polished the once-coveredwooden floors ... repaired or replaced aging windows, screens,ceilings, and doors ... and even put on a new roof - all of which,I like to think, kept him busy until I came along!</p><br /><p>Nowadays, here on our tiny urban homestead only a block fromTampa Bay, we come just about as close to self-reliance as ispossible in a city. The two original gardens have been joined by anherb plot, grapevines, two wildly productive fig trees, and threevarieties of Florida apple trees (which are actually imports fromIsrael). We have a small banana grove in the side yard . . . andmaverick papayas pop up from time to time all over theproperty.<br /></p><br /><div align="right"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/library/1985_March_April/Urban_Homesteading_in_Florida">READ THE FULL STORY</a><br /></div><br /><p><br /></p><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div align="center"><br /><h2><a name="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Helpful" id="Homesteading_and_Self-reliance:_Helpful"></a>Homesteading andSelf-reliance: Helpful Resources</h2><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><h3>Helpful Publications:</h3><br /><i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.MotherEarthNews.com">www.MotherEarthNews.com</a></i><i><br /></i><br /><i>Back Home</i><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.backhomemagazine.com"><i>www.backhomemagazine.com</i></a><br /><br /><i>Backwoods Home</i><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.backwoodshome.com"><i>www.backwoodshome.com</i></a><br /><br /><i>Countryside</i><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.countrysidemag.com"><i>www.countrysidemag.com</i></a><br /><br /><i>Small Farmer's Journal</i><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.smallfarmersjournal.com"><i>www.smallfarmersjournal.com</i></a><br /><br /><i>Rural Heritage</i><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ruralheritage.com"><i>www.ruralheritage.com</i></a><br /><br /><i>Harrowsmith Country Life</i><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.harrowsmithcountrylife.ca"><i>www.harrowsmithcountrylife.ca</i></a><br /><br /><br /><h3>Helpful Organizations:</h3><br />ALBC American Livestock Breeds Conservancy<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.albc-us.org"><i>www.albc-us.org</i></a><br /><br /> Intentional Communities<br /><i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ic.org">www.ic.org</a></i><br /></div><br /></div><br /></div><br /></div><br /><br /><br /></div><br /></div>
