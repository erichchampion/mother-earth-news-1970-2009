                        <p>      Call it technological overkill, or a kind of Rube Goldberg      like fixation, or whatever the fact is, a lot of engineers      and scientists involved in today's solar research are      coming up with devices so complicated and costly that most      folks will never have any use for them. George Donald      Graham, however, is one man who still sees the sun as a      "people's" power provider and his newly released, self      published book Capture the Sun: The Parabolic Curve and its      Applications may prove to be the opening of a new door for      those who simply want to make use of Ole Sol in the most      direct and economical manner possible.    </p>    <p>      Parabolic curves are nothing new nor are mirrors and      reflectors constructed in that shape but a detailed,      thoroughly outlined explanation of the basic mathematics      behind them is new and useful. If you have a working      knowledge of high school algebra and geometry, Mr. Graham's      book can show you how to design and construct economical,      sun tracking parabolic mirrors of infinitely variable size,      which are able to perform virtually any task requiring      heat.    </p>    <p>      Plans for a solar oven and water heater are included in      Capture the Sun, but the main idea is to provide you with a      "tool" an ability to gather and focus the sun's rays for      devising your own applications. The possibilities are      endless.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Graham writes, "It is vitally necessary that we, as      individuals, protect our heritage and compete with whatever      or whomever is striving to strangle our nation by      constructing our own devices, and thereby producing at      least a part of our energy needs. We can do it. YOU can do      it. You can change the world!"    </p>    <p>      Maybe with the help of men like George Donald Graham, we      can do just that. Copies of Capture the Sun: The Parabolic      Curve and its Applications are available for $2.50 from      Enterprises Unlimited, Star Route, Ferndale, Calif. 95536      or from MOTHER'S Bookshelf.    </p>
