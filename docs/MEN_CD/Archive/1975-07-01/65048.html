        <p id="byline">Before long i'll moving to my 40-acre homestead Idaho, where the trees tower around me and make me feel an ant in the grass. The place has no electricity probably won't have any for a few years until I devise sort of wind or water plant. The idea of doing without pm; doesn't bother me much, though except that I'd like refrigerator.</p><p>Now, here's what I've been thinking: There's plenty of water on my land, and I believe I can use that resource to my food cool in summer. First I'll build a wooden box waterproof all the edges with fiberglass, and cut a hole in send for the door. Then I'll construct a slightly larger contains (Box B), seal the edges, provide a door hole as before, and 6Â° drill one hole in the top for a water intake and another in bottom for a drain, Box A will stand inside Box B on four bricks.</p><p>My next step will be to build a doorframe between inner and outer walls, so that no water can escape when cooler is opened. I'll then install a door, preferably ca thickness to match the space between the two boxes. Final I'll let in the water. With luck nothing will leak, and circulating liquid will keep the contents of Box A nice cool.</p><p>I'd be glad to hear any opinions on the practicality of idea. Many of the thoughts shared through MOTHER had,been very useful to me, and I hope the notion I've described may be of help to someone else.</p>
