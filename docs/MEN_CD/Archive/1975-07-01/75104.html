        <p><strong>OUR HATS ARE OFF TO MAINE'S GOVERNOR LONGLEY</strong> and Office of Energy Resources, who've ignored the advances of would be oil refinery builders in lieu of a better plan: A crash program to supplement the Pine Tree state's fuel needs by converting surplus and waste wood into clean burning methanol for heating homes and powering automobiles. If the idea is successful and there's no reason why it shouldn't be Maine may well become the first (and only) place in the nation to wean itself and its citizens from total dependence on oil. What has your state been doing lately?<br /><strong><br />IF THEY'RE SO RICH, WHY AREN'T THEY DUMB?</strong> Saudi Arabia land of the largest oil reserves on Earth ain't about to follow in the western world's gas guzzling footsteps. Instead, the country plans to supply its own power needs with the sun (a much more abundant resource!) and save its "black gold" for high priced export and more productive domestic purposes: the manufacture of food, fertilizer, and medicine. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues its frantic search for more and more and more petroleum.<br /><strong><br />JIM BEENE'S WIND POWERED HOME HEATING SYSTEM</strong> works whether backyard breezes are blowing or not. The Pennsylvania physicist's "better idea" feeds generated electricity to immersion heaters placed in a large basement water tank the resulting hot liquid holds its temperature for days, and can be circulated from room to room for good ole toasty warmth whenever he wants it by way of a conventional, thermostatically controlled radiator system!<br /><strong><br />WE CAN ALL BREATHE A LITTLE EASIER</strong> now that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (which replaced the Atomic Energy: Commission in January) has announced that it has postponed for at least three years a final decision on whether plutonium should be used as fuel for America's nuclear power plants. The radioactive isotope called "the most dangerous substance known to man", capable of endangering life on this planet for hundreds of generations, but touted by the atomic industry as a necessary fuel for its Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactors has been the subject of controversy for over a decade. The NRC's move (its first major ruling) is encouraging, and gives environmental groups a bit more time to fight for a permanent ban on the incredibly dangerous substance.<br /><br /><strong>NEW YORK CITY INVENTOR WAYNE P. LE VAN</strong> sees "weight power" as an untapped source of energy, and has devised a system whereby cars, buses, and trucks passing over sub street "Generizers" much like the "hit plates" used to trigger traffic lights would activate generators to produce "free" electricity. Ridiculous? Well, let's see the gizmos would require no fuel would make additional use of the gas all those vehicles are guzzling anyway would pay for themselves hmmmm .<br /><br /><strong>AMERICA'S OIL PROBLEMS ARE GETTING WORSE</strong> instead of better, according to a study made for the Commerce Department by a select panel of experts. Their statistics show that U.S. petroleum production is currently five percent less than it was a year ago, and that the country relies more on foreign fuel now than before the 1973 74 Arab embargo. We wouldn't want to say "I told you so", but if folks look in MOTHER NO. 27's "Energy Flashes" .<br /><strong><br />"OK," SAID THE LITTLE RED HEN, "I'LL DO IT MYSELF"</strong> and so will the citizens of Springfield, Vermont and six other area towns who've recently voted for public takeover of their regional power company. Meanwhile, the residents of two additional villages in that state have cast their ballots to quash any further local development of nuclear generating plants. And if they can do it <strong><br /><br />AND IN SOMEWHAT MORE DRASTIC ACTION, 20,000</strong> local farmers and residents stormed the police occupied construction site of a nuclear power facility in Why, West Germany. The protesters made their way through ten rows of barbed wire fence, and after a lengthy battle forced 3,000 law enforcement officers to request safe conduct out of the area.<br /><br /><strong>THE SOLAR WIND COMPANY</strong> of East Holden, Maine has sold its inventory and marketing operations to Enertech Corporation (P.O. Box 420, Norwich, Vt. 05055). Enertech now sells Elektro, Dunlite, and Wincharger generators, related booklets; wind velocity measuring devices, and auxiliary equipment.<br /><strong><br />ENGINEERS AT DAIMLER BENZ IN WEST GERMANY</strong> have reported major Orogress in their efforts toward development of an economical, efficient, hydrogen powered car. According to the researchers, experiments with fuel tanks containing hydrides which absorb the gas for small space storage, and stabilize its volatile nature indicate that such a vehicle is entirely feasible for today's intracity traffic needs. Hydrogen, of course, is available in almost unlimited quantity (by way of electrolysis from water) and combines with oxygen into little more than harmless steam when burned.<br /><br /><strong>A STATE SPONSORED FEASIBILITY STUDY OF METHANE PRODUCTION</strong> in Vermont has dampened enthusiasm for developing the energy source in that area mainly because engineers placed an estimated cost of $180,000 or more on a proposed experimental digester: An interesting figure indeed, in light of the fact that a working, efficient, 280 cubic foot per day bio gas plant was constructed in the Green Mountain state in 1972 for under $800.<br /><strong><br />A UNIQUE NEW SOLAR HEAT PUMP</strong> now being developed by engineers at Battelle Columbus Labs in Ohio may prove to be so efficient that skeptical homeowners and builders will finally begin converting their energy intensive "whole house air, conditioning" to at least partial use of "free", abundant sun power. The low friction, long lasting device incorporated into a system including roof mounted collectors, a heat exchanger and storage tank, and conventional "home comfort" equipments said to be capable of operating on nothing but solar power 60 to 80%0 of the time (depending on climate). It should be on the market in about five years.<br /></p>
