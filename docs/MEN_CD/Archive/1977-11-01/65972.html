                    <p>      Naturally, after four years at the game, I found your      article "You Can Earn Extra Cash With a Lawn-Mowing      Business" in MOTHER NO. 46 (page 81) very interesting. I      originally started out (September 1973) doing odd jobs ...      in fact, that's still my official business title. I did      anything that would bring in the money      andgradually-discovered how nice it was to make that      money mowing lawns: You work outside, meet some fine      people, and perform a needed service.    </p>    <p>      So I enrolled in a landscaping course and began investing      in some good equipment. My inventory is now $4,000 (I plan      to stop at this point so I don't get too big to control      customer relations on a one-to-one basis) and my service      has broadened to include every facet of landscaping from      consultation (very lucrative in the spring) to design (lots      of fun if you can find enough to keep busy) to      installations (more fun) to maintenance (the bread and      butter of the operation). My first month in business I      grossed $153. Last year I reported $19,192.80 which has      made me justly proud (and not a little weary).    </p>    <p>      During the course of this growth and learning, I've      assembled some ground rules for myself that I'd like to      pass on to others.    </p>    <p>      [1] Know the capabilities of your machines, your worker(s),      and-most important-yourself.    </p>    <p>      [2] Get acquainted with others in your area who are doing      the same thing so you'll know the prevailing market price      for land scape/gardening work on an hourly basis ($12 per      man per hour in the Boston area). You'll also be better      able to give job quotes to customers who are leery of      hourly charges.    </p>    <p>      [3] Establish a minimum charge, and charge it. It costs to      gather together all your equipment and transport it to the      site, in addition to doing the actual job. Don't be afraid      of asking too much ... you'll quickly be told if you are,      but very few people will freely tell you you're charging      too little. 'Tis better to be high and in than low and      lose.    </p>    <p>      [4] If you say you'll do something at such and such a time,      do it. Everyone and his brother are out there making      agreements ... and often they show up two weeks late and do      half a job. If you establish yourself as a man of your      word, and charge a reasonable rate, you'll soon be overrun      with customers begging for your services.    </p>    <p>      [5] Advertise only in the area where you wish to do      business. 30 minutes travel time to a job costs you $12 (in      my area) round trip, and that doesn't include operational      expenses. Keep your business local.    </p>    <p>      [6] Get a trailer with a floor not more than eight inches      off the ground, large automobile or truck tires, a hinged      ramp, and sides at least two feet high. Smaller trailers      are not durable, are unsafe (they're too easily overloaded      and they don't track well), and are just downright      inconvenient. Take it from one who now owns an ex-U-Haul 5      X 9.    </p>    <p>      [7] Service your equipment religiously (at least every 25      working hours). Oil or grease everything that moves. Keep      it clean and tidy. Change that dirty engine oil (new      powerplants cost plenty). That may sound like a lot of      service (I figure at least three hours every Sunday) but      it'll put money in your pocket.    </p>    <p>      [8] Get a one-ton-rated pickup, dump truck, or platform      truck with a hoist under the body. It'll enable you to haul      either sod or loam, carry large amounts of new shrubs and      trees, and cart away all of a customer's debris (believe      me, there'll be plenty) ... and unload everything without      breaking your back, at a considerable savings in time      (which is money in the bank). Shop wisely (truck body and      equipment shops, other contractors, farmers, and-as a      last resort-used car lots) and you can get a good      buy.    </p>    <p>      [9] A leaf blower or lawn vacuum will pay for itself your      first season.    </p>    <p>      [10] Obtain a good tarpaulin (at least 8' X 8') for hauling      debris. It'll pay for itself on your first cleanup job.    </p>    <p>      [11] One pair of $8.00 pruning shears will outlast four      pairs of $3.00 ones. Moral: Buy the best. You'll I save in      the long run.    </p>    <p>      [12] Use chemicals very, very sparingly and with utmost      caution and concern for safety. They can be deadly to you      as well as to their intended victims. This warning applies      to chemical fertilizers, also, but fortunately many      manufacturers offer partly organic lawn fertilizers. Use      them.    </p>    <p>      [13) Never, never work any kind of lawn equipment without      heavy work shoes (preferably steel-toed ones) that cover at      least your ankles, and higher if you can tolerate them. A      whirling blade can sling pieces of steel, rocks, and wood      with fantastic force (I've seen mowers hurl pebbles over 20      feet to break windows). Believe me, I've got scars to prove      there's a danger.    </p>    <p>      [14] Be careful never to put your hand or any tool under a      lawn mower without first disconnecting the spark plug wire.      Better yet, remove the plug entirely... the machines      <em>have</em> been known to start up just because the blade      was moved.    </p>    <p>      [15] Don't-under any circumstances-ride a mower      up an incline while you're sitting on the machine's lower      side. (I learned this lesson the hard way when a riding      mower actually flipped over on me as I was going up a      grade.) If you think you'll have to lean into the job and      strain to move a push mower up a particular hill or bank,      always either back a riding mower up the slope or mow      across it sideways.    </p>    <p>      In closing, I'd like to make one specific recommendation      about equipment. I've had a Sensation 19" walk-behind lawn      mower for three years now and find it to be one of the most      pleasant of all the machines on the market to work with: It      will cut in either direction without your having to lift      and turn the mower (just reverse the handle and push) ...      it moves easily on roller bearings ... it's made of      durable, heavy, cast aluminummagnesium alloy ... and it's      easy to service.    </p>    <p>      Michael L.
