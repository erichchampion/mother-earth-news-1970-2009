             				    <p>      There's a young couple in New Hampshire who-in their      own small way-are devoting much more than lip service to      the future welfare of mankind. Naoto and Berri Inoue      (carpenter and craft kit designer, respectively) decided      early this year that the time had come for them to actively      involve themselves in working for a better world. Here, in      their own words (extracted from a letter they wrote to      MOTHER), is what they did.    </p>    <p>      "Our main objective for the past five years has been to      achieve self-sufficiency. We've been lucky to have had much      success with our projects, but we must admit that there are      no free lunches ... we've put a lot of sweat and love into      them. But the point of this letter is not to show off what      fortunate situations we've fallen into. It's to explain how      we felt that- in order to completely achieve our life      goals-we couldn't just look towards our land, our two      geodesic domes, our woodshop, and our reputations as      skilled workers,    </p>    <p>      "We realize that there are countless causes to be worked      on...and we also know that we can't get much done with all      our energy dipped into many pots. So the cause that we've      chosen is the elimination of nuclear pollution.    </p>    <p>      "We had lots of thoughts on how to bring forth action, or      at least education. But unfortunately all of them required      money (for stickers, literature, etc.). Need we say that      money for such projects is not easily come by?    </p>    <p>      "Still, Berri has studied art and had recently taken a      course in calligraphy, so she decided to try her hand at      designing some greeting cards. We chose quotations that      were not just sharp 'no nuke' slogans, since we know that      there are a lot of people out there who'd like to see the      end of nuclear power and war but who for various reasons      don't want to have bumper stickers or T-shirts that say so.    </p>    <p>      "Our cards-which are printed on recycled      paper-can be sent to anyone on any occasion. On the      back of each is a statement that the profits from their      sale are being used to educate against nuclear power. Each      package contains 12 cards (six different designs) and 12      envelopes, and we've prepared 1,000 such packages as a      'trial run'."    </p>    <p>      The Inoues have put $1,000 of their own hardearned money      and a lot of their time into this venture. And, as you can      see from the photo, their cards would be a perfect way to      send holiday greetings...and would make nice Christmas      gifts in themselves. So we're all for this young couple,      and we hope you will be too. If you'd like to help Naoto      and Berri make this project a success, send your name and      address and $2.00 for each package desired (plus 354V      postage and handling for one package, 55c for two, 75c for      three, and 95c for four or more) to:    </p>    <p>      Mellow Crafts<br />      RFD 2 off Grant Road<br />      Newmarket, N.H. 03857    </p>
