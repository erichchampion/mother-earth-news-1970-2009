        <p>Lightly coat three large (19-ounce) soup cans with vegetable oil. Then measure 1/2 cup white flour, 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup light molasses, 2 cups of buttermilk, 2 teaspoons of soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt into a large bowl. Mix all ingredients together thoroughly and then fill each can just two-thirds full. (Any more and you'll have to clean your oven later!)</p><p>Let the batter rise for a half hour ... then bake in a 350Â° oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool the "baking tins" until you can handle them easily, then slide a thinbladed knife around the loaves and shake them out.</p><p>This Boston Brown Bread, which is a favorite with Mrs. Stewart's family and friends, should be completely cooled and then wrapped in foil or plastic and stored in the refrigerator. If you like, you can freeze it too. Serve the bread plain or with any spread you like. It'll satisfy that sweet tooth without actually putting on (too many of) the pounds.</p>
