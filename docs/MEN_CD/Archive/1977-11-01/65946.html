    <p>
             		        <p>      Very few store-bought gifts carry the warmth, the      tenderness, the "I've been thinking about you" feeling that      just naturally goes with homemade goodies whipped up right      there in your own kitchen.    </p>    <p>      Do-it-yourself holiday gifts of food come in all sizes,      shapes, and colors . . . and all flavors! Some are for      serving on the very day you give them, and others are for      stashing away until Christmas or New Year's. (I've found      that cakes and breads are particularly welcome when      delivered to a special friend or neighbor for Christmas Eve      supper or a Christmas morning brunch. And more casual      friends, a child's favorite teacher, etc., always seem      pleased and flattered to receive home-brewed candies,      cheese spreads, and homemade jam ... especially when the      presents are packaged imaginatively in a reusable      container.)    </p>    <p>      And don't try to keep all this holiday fun to yourself! The      recipes listed here have been specially chosen because I've      found them so easy to prepare that the whole family can      take part in the festivities!    </p>    <h3>NIBBLES, AN APPETIZER, AND SEASONED SALT</h3>    <p>      <strong>EASY BEEF JERKY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Trim all the fat from as much beef flank steak as you care      to prepare (and start with lots, since the meat will shrink      a great deal as it dries). Cut the steak lengthwise (with      the grain) into long, thin strips that are no more than 1/8      inch thick. Toss with 1/2 cup soy sauce that contains 1/2      teaspoon each of garlic salt and lemon pepper. Then place      the strips close together-but not overlapping-in a single      layer on a rack over a baking sheet, and bake in a slow      oven (150 to 175°F) overnight or 10 to 12 hours. Store      the finished jerky at room temperature in an airtight      container. If all the fat was trimmed away from the meat in      the beginning, this jerky will keep indefinitely.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOLIDAY APPETIZER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Toast several strips of thoroughly dried jerky (see above)      in a hot oven (450°F) until the snack is hot and breaks      easily. Then crumble the dried and toasted meat into small      pieces and serve as tasty tidbits at parties, potlucks, and      on camping trips. Or package in small, decorated glass jars      (try designing your own label, or pasting a magazine's      holiday scenes on the containers) and give to your friends.      And, as a special added thought for the recipients who      cook, it's nice to include the recipe!    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPICY SEASONED SALT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine 1/4 teaspoon dill weed, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1      teaspoon dried thyme, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon      curry powder, 1-1/2 teaspoons dried oregano, 2 teaspoons      dry mustard, 2 teaspoons paprika, and I cup coarse salt and      mix well. Place in an airtight container, seal tightly,.      and store for three to six months in a cool place (so the      flavors can blend together). Use in your own holiday      recipes ... or pour into individual gift salt shakers,      attach "From the Kitchen of Your Name" labels, and give to      your friends.    </p>    <p>      SPECIAL NOTE: Many of the ingredients in this recipe can be      grown in your own garden for an added personal touch. And,      if you go that far into the herb business, why not go just      a little farther ... and start a few mini-herb gardens      early enough in the year so you'll have some to give as      Christmas presents? Place seeds or cuttings in all-purpose      soil in threeinch pots, set in a sunny window in a tray      that contains water and small rocks (the water's level      should be below-never touching-the bottoms of the pots),      and keep the soil moist. Chives-which can be used to flavor      all kinds of soups, salads, and other dishes-grow from      seeds very quickly and make especially nice gifts.    </p>    <h3>CHEESE SPREADS AND HEAD CHEESE</h3>    <p>      <strong>BRANDIED BUTTER-CHEESE SPREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Grate 1/2 pound sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 pound sharp      processed cheddar cheese food into a bowl. Blend in one      package (8 ounces) of cream cheese and 1/2 cup (1 stick) of      soft butter. Then work in 1/4 cup of brandy, 1 teaspoon of      curry powder, 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and 6      drops of hot pepper sauce and blend the mixture until it's      smooth. Spoon into brandy snifters, parfait glasses, or      other festive containers and refrigerate until "gifting"      time. Men, in particular, seem to go for the      curry-and-brandy flavor that makes this spread unique.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHEERY-BEERY CHEESE SPREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Open one can or bottle (12 ounces) of beer and let it stand      while you grate 1-1/2 pounds (6 cups) of sharp cheddar      cheese and crumble 1/4 pound of blue cheese. Mix the two      cheeses together with 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt and 1      teaspoon of dry mustard ... then blend in 1/4 cup (1/2      stick) of softened butter, 2 tablespoons of finely minced      green onions, 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, and 1/8      teaspoon of red pepper sauce. Add the beer gradually, while      you beat the whole creation with an electric mixer until      it's creamy. This spread is quite thin when first made, but      sets up as it chills. Keep it refrigerated.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHEESE'N'WINE SPREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Place 1/2 pound of blue cheese and one package (8 ounces)      of cream cheese in a bowl and mash them with a fork.      Gradually add I cup (1/2 pint) of dairy sour cream and      blend the resulting mixture until it's smooth. Then add 2      tablespoons of chopped parsley, 2 tablespoons of sherry      wine, a dash of cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon of very finely      minced green onion, 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, 1/4      teaspoon garlic salt, and 1/4 teaspoon seasoned pepper. Mix      well. This spread keeps well in the refrigerator and should      be made several hours before it's served, so that its      flavors will have time to blend.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HEAD CHEESE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Ask your butcher to trim a pig's head for you (he should      remove the eyes, the nose, the internal ear, the teeth, and      the hair), and to save you one set of pig's feet. Pull out      the sinews and sear the feet. Then scrape and clean both      the head and the feet, cover with water, add 3 or 4 onions      and spices to taste, and cook until the meat falls off the      bones (about two hours). Remove from heat, bone and dice      (or put the pork through a grinder). Strain broth, add meat      (and more seasonings, if desired), cool, and pour into      molds that have been rinsed in cold water. Keep      refrigerated.    </p>    <h3>KETCHUP, RELISH, AND MINCED PIE</h3>    <p>      <strong>TOMATO KETCHUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      This one is just a little different from the usual holiday      homemade gifts of food ... but delightful (partly because      you took the time to make it).    </p>    <p>      Cook 1/2 peck of tomatoes, 3 red peppers, and 2 minced      onions together (without adding water) until they're soft      and mushy. Then put the pulpy mass through a strainer or      sieve and, for every 4 quarts of the strained mixture, add      2 tablespoons of salt, 1/4 cup of honey, and (in a      cheesecloth bag) 2 teaspoons of dry mustard, 1-1/2      teaspoons of celery seed, 1 tablespoon of whole allspice, 1      tablespoon of cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of cloves, and 1      tablespoon of paprika. Cook rapidly for about one hour,      then add 2 cups of vinegar and continue cooking until the      mixture is thick. Remove the bag of spices, pour the      ketchup into hot, sterilized jars, seal the containers at      once, and process them for 10 minutes in a boiling      (212°F) water bath.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CORN RELISH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Slice the kernels from 6 ears of cooked, fresh corn (or use      medium can of well drained whole kernel corn). Add 1/2 of a      medium green pepper (chopped), 3 to 5 chopped celery      stalks, 1 chopped onion, 2-1/2 tablespoons of chopped      pimento, 2-1/2 tablespoons of white vinegar, 21/2 teaspoons      of salt, 1 teaspoon of dry mustard, 1 teaspoon of pepper,      and 2/3 cup of olive oil. Stir together and allow to stand      for 4 to 6 hours to mellow. Then cover and store in a      refrigerator. This relish keeps well for at least a month.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEEF SUET MINCED PIE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Line a pie plate with pastry and cover with 1 cup of      chopped beef suet spread out into an even layer. Spread 1      cup of brown or maple sugar or 3/4 cup of honey over the      suet and, if desired, add a layer of either 1 cup of      chopped tart apples or 1 cup of raisins. Then mix 3      tablespoons of vinegar with 3 tablespoons of water and pour      over all. Cover with pastry and bake in a hot oven.    </p>    <h3>APRICOT DELIGHTS</h3>    <p>      <strong>FRUIT-'COT CAKES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine 3 cups of unsifted all-purpose flour, 1 cup of      honey, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 2      teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/2      cup orange juice, 1/2 cup brandy (or water), 1 cup salad      oil, 1/4 cup light corn syrup, and 3 eggs in a large mixer      bowl. Blend for half a minute on low speed while you      occasionally scrape the bowl ... then beat at high speed      for three minutes (while, again, you scrape the bowl      occasionally).    </p>    <p>      Stir in 1 cup of dark seedless raisins, 2 cups of diced      dried California apricots, 1 pound (2 cups) of mixed      candied fruits, and 2 cups of pecan halves ... and spoon      the batter into three dozen 2-1/2-inch muffin pans (or      six-ounce custard cups) lined with paper baking cups. Bake      in 275'F oven for 65 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick      comes out clean when inserted into the center of one of the      cakes.    </p>    <p>      Allow the fruitcakes to cool in their pans for five      minutes, then remove them to a rack and let them cool      thoroughly. Finally, heat 1/3 cup of light corn syrup in a      small pan, brush it over the tops of the cakes, and store      them -covered with a brandy-soaked cheesecloth-in a cool      place in tightly closed containers for up to two weeks. If      you intend to keep the cakes longer, freeze them in tightly      covered containers.    </p>    <p>      VARIATIONS: The batter for this recipe may also be baked in      small (about 4 inches tall and 2-1/2 inches across) clean      food cans. Grease the containers generously, fill 2/3 full      with batter, and bake in a 275°F oven for I to 1-1/2      hours, or until the fruitcakes test done. If you like, you      can also bake Fruit'Cot batter for 2-1/2 to 3 hours in two      9" X 5" loaf pans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>APRICOT SNOWBALLS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Use a rolling pin to crush 2 cups of cornflakes, bran, or      wheat flakes between two sheets of wax paper. Then stir the      crushed flakes, 1/3 cup of diced pitted dates, 2/3 cup of      diced dried California apricots, and 1/2 cup of chopped      pecans together in a large bowl until they're well mixed.      Melt 1/4 cup of honey and 3 tablespoons of butter or      margarine together in a small pan, and blend in 1 teaspoon      of vanilla. Pour the blend over the cornflake mixture, mix      thoroughly, and chill 30 minutes. Use 1 tablespoon of the      chilled recipe to form each ball, roll the balls in      granulated sugar (if desired), and garnish each one      (there'll be about 30) with a strip of dried apricot, or a      red glace' cherry half. Serve immediately, cover and chill      until needed, or pack the Apricot Snowballs inside a candy      jar or decorative bowl and carry to your favorite neighbor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRANDIED'COTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Drain two Announce cans of whole apricots and reserve 2      cups of the syrup. Combine the syrup in a medium-sized      saucepan with 3/4 cup of brandy, 2 broken cinnamon sticks,      and 6 whole cloves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and      simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. Then pour the hot syrup      over the drained apricots in a bowl. Cover and chill about      3 or 4 hours or until serving time.    </p>    <h3>PEAR TREATS</h3>    <p>      <strong>ROSEY PEARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Drain two 29-ounce cans of Bartlett pear halves and reserve      the syrup. Bring the syrup to a boil with 1/2 cup of      cinnamon candies and 1/4 teaspoon of whole cloves. Simmer 5      minutes, then add the pear halves and 2 tablespoons of      lemon juice. Simmer 5 minutes more and chill. Rosey Pears      keep well for two weeks when refrigerated and they're good      with pork and lamb.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RELISH PEARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Drain two 29-ounce cans of Bartlett pear halves and reserve      one cup of the syrup. Combine the syrup with 3/4 cup of      salad oil, 1/3 cup of vinegar, 1-1/4 teaspoons of salt, 2      tablespoons of capers, 2 tablespoons of chopped pimento, 3      tablespoons of lemon juice, and I sliced small onion. Pour      the mixture over the pear halves and chill. If covered and      stored in the refrigerator, Relish Pears will keep for two      weeks. Serve as a meat accompaniment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPICY PICKLED PEARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Drain one 29-ounce can of Bartlett pear halves and reserve      1 cup of the syrup. Mix the reserved syrup with 3/4 cup of      honey, 1/4 cup of vinegar, 1 teaspoon of whole cloves, and      1 stick of cinnamon. Simmer 10 minutes, then add the pear      halves (cut into lengthwise slices), and heat thoroughly.      Refrigerate several hours and serve with meat or poultry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PIQUANT PEAR CHUTNEY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Drain and dice one 29-ounce can of Bartlett pears and      reserve 1/2 cup of the syrup. Then combine the diced pears,      the reserved Syrup, 1 cup of golden raisins, 3/4 cup of      honey, 1/2 cup of vinegar, the grated peel of 1 orange, 1      tablespoon of chopped crystallized ginger, 1 minced clove      of garlic, 1 tablespoon of grated onion, 1/2 teaspoon of      salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, and      1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Cook slowly until thick      (about 20 to 30 minutes) while you stir the mixture      frequently to prevent it from sticking. Pour the hot      chutney into heated jars (leave 1/4-inch head space),      tighten caps, and process 10 minutes in a boiling water      bath. The three 1/2-pint containers that this recipe yields      are delicious with chicken or lamb.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ORANGE-SCENTED PEARS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine one 29-ounce can of undrained Bartlett pear halves      with 1 unpeeled, sliced orange and 1/2 cup of      orangeflavored liqueur. Cover and refrigerate for several      hours, then serve as chilled dessert (with or without ice      cream) or heat and serve over crepes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PEAR HONEY BREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Drain a 29-ounce can of Bartlett pear halves, save one cup      of the syrup, and chop all but two of the halves into fine      pieces. Then combine the cup of syrup with 2/3 cup of brown      sugar, 3/4 cup of honey, 1/4 cup of salad oil, 2 eggs, and      2 teaspoons of grated lemon peel. Stir in the chopped pears      and 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. Then sift together 4 cups of      allpurpose flour, 3 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 teaspoon      of baking soda, and 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt. Add the flour      mixture to the pear mixture and stir just until they're      blended ... then pour into two greased 4-1/2" X 8-1/2" loaf      pans. Cut the two reserved pear halves into slices, arrange      them over the top of the batter, and bake the loaves of      bread at 350'F for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick      inserted into their centers comes out clean. Remove loaves      from pans and let them cool. For the best flavor, wrap this      bread in foil and let it stand overnight or longer before      serving. Pear Honey Bread will keep up to a week.    </p>    <h3>A JAM, A JELLY, AND CANDY CAKE</h3>    <p>      <strong>BANANA JAM</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is really one of my favorite holiday treats. Boil      2-1/4 cups of honey with 3 cups of water for 12 minutes.      Then add the juice of 3 lemons, the rind of the lemons (cut      into thin slices), 8 mashed ripe bananas, 1 piece of whole      dried green ginger, and 3 or 4 cloves. Cook slowly for 45      minutes as you stir the mixture to keep it from burning.      When the jam turns light yellow and becomes thick, remove      the ginger, pour the jam into glasses, and add paraffin      seals and lids. This recipe makes about seven 8-ounce      glasses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUICK HOLIDAY JELLY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine 2 cups of port wine, 1 cup of bottled grape juice,      1/4 cup of strained lemon juice, and one package (3 ounces)      of powdered pectin in a deep and large saucepan. Heat to      boiling, stir in 2-3/8 cups of honey, let the mixture come      to a full rolling boil, and boil it hard for two minutes.      Remove the jelly from the heat and allow it to stop boiling      ... then skim and ladle the jelly into sterilized glasses      (or decorative mugs, glasses, or jars if you're preparing      holiday gifts). Sea] with paraffin. Yield: 5 glasses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CANDY CAKE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cream 1 cup of butter or margarine and 1-1/2 cups of honey      until they're fluffy. Then beat in 5 eggs-one egg at a      time-and stir in 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 1/2 cup of      buttermilk, and 1/2 cup of cream sherry. Mix I cup of      cut-up dates, 1 pound of cut-up candy orange slices, 1 cup      of chopped nuts, 1cup (a 4-ounce can) of coconut, and 1/2      cup of sifted all. purpose flour together in another bowl.      In yet another bowl, sift together 3-1/2 cups of      all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1      teaspoon <em>of</em> salt. Add the flour-soda-salt mixture      to the creamed butter and honey and blend until smooth.      Then stir in the candy mixture, spoon into two wellgreased      9" X 5" X 2" loaf pans, and bake in a 325°F oven for      one hour.    </p>    <p>      This recipe is usually a big hit with folks who don't      ordinarily enjoy more traditional fruitcakes and men, in      particular, go for it whenever it's served. Wrap this Candy      Cake in foil or plastic wrap and tie it with a ribbon. It      keeps well and freezes well, so don't be afraid to make it      ahead. One tip, though: Warm orange slices tend to stick to      a knife ... so cut this cake only when it's cool.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHRISTMAS CANDIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most of these candy recipes are over 85 years old and were      handed down to me by a distant relative who used them for      more than 40 years on an eastern farm.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FIG CANDY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine 3/4 cup of honey with 1/3 cup of water and boil      until the mixture is an amber color (do not stir during      this boiling). Stir 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar into      the mixture just before taking it from the stove. Then      place enough washed and opened figs on a greased cookie      sheet to cover it, and pour the candy over them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOREHOUND CANDY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Boil 2 ounces of dried horehound in 1-1/2 pints of water      for a half hour. Then strain and add 3-1/2 pounds of brown      sugar. Boil to the hard ball stage (270°F) and pour      onto a well-greased cookie sheet. When the candy is cool      enough to hold its shape, mark it into squares.    </p>    <p>      <strong>VINEGAR CANDY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Combine 2-1/4 cups of honey, 1/2 cup of vinegar, and 1/2      <em>cup of</em> water. Stir together and put on stove (do      not stir after this). Cook rather quickly to just below the      firm ball stage (240°F), then drop in one teaspoon of      butter in small pieces. Continue cooking, rather slowly, to      the hard ball stage (270°F) and, just before removing      from stove, stir in 1/2 teaspoon of soda dissolved in a      couple of drops of water. When the taffy is cool enough to      handle, pull it by hand until it's white and use scissors      to cut it into bite-sized pieces.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAPLE SYRUP FUDGE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Measure 2 cups of maple syrup and 4 tablespoons <em>of</em>      butter into a large saucepan and boil to 23°F, or until      the solution just holds together when dropped into cold      (not iced) water. Remove from heat and let cool to lukewarm      ... then beat the mixture until it begins to lose its      gloss. Pour the fudge into a lightly buttered 8" X 4" loaf      pan immediately and cut it into squares before it has      completely hardened.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAPLE SUGAR FUDGE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Measure 2 cups of maple sugar and 1/2 pint (1 cup) of cream      into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and boil to 240°F, or      until the mixture forms a soft ball when dropped into cold      (not iced) water. Remove from heat and let cool to lukewarm      ... then beat the mixture until it begins to lose its      gloss. Pour the fudge into a lightly buttered 8" X 4" loaf      pan immediately and cut it into squares before it has      completely hardened.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HONEY SQUARES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Heat 1 cup honey and 1 cup peanut butter in a saucepan.      Stir until smooth and remove from heat, then stir in 1 cup      of carob powder. Mix. Then add 1 cup of shelled sunflower      seeds, 1/2 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup of chopped nuts, 1/2 cup      of coconut, and 1/2 cup of toasted sesame seeds. Press the      mixture into a buttered 8"-square pan. Chill      overnight and cut into squares. Yield: about two pounds.    </p>    <p>      Honey squares make nice gifts when either wrapped in      aluminum foil or plastic wrap and tied with brightly      colored yarn ... or tucked into decorated coffee cans or      colorful boxes or baskets. They're even appreciated when      stacked up on festively ornamented paper plates. Use your      imagination-the whole family's imagination!-when      packaging your "kitchen goodie" presents.    </p>
