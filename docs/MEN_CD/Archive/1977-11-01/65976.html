                 <h5 id="byline">by ALDEN STAHR</h5>    <p>      "Well sir, I'll tell you," said my neighbor, Wulf      Knausenberger, when I asked him about the luxurious thicket      of peppery edible leaves crowding the banks of his      homestead's everflowing spring.<br />    </p>    		<p>     "I was out walkin' one day when I noticed some wild    watercress in a stream, and I thought it'd be kinda nice if I    had a little growin' here on my place. So I pulled up a few    plants, brought 'em home, and planted 'em there in the    spring. That was years ago and, ever since then, I've always    had an abundance of watercress salad greens ... not just in    the fall and spring, but all winter too. Even when the    temperature plunges well below zero, I can still count on    that cress."<br />    <br />    "How is that possible?" I asked.<br />    <br />    "Oh, it's no problem at all. That spring water comes out of    the ground at a constant 550F . . . which keeps the plants    from freezin', no matter how cold the weather might get.    Sure, when the thermometer dips down to zero or lower, the    top leaves of the cress do turn a little dark ... but I've    never seen 'em frostbitten."<br />    <br />    And so began my love affair with watercress ... a plant that    sometimes seems absolutely anxious to put heaping platefuls    of smartly flavored, vitaminrich greens on the table at the    very time (winter) that most other salad plants have long    since given up the ghost.<br />    <br />    Watercress is probably the easiest "garden" plant you'll ever    attempt to grow ... especially if, like Wulf, you're lucky    enough to have an ever-flowing spring on your property. Once    you've planted a few sprigs of the cress in the bubbling    natural well, you'll find this member of the pepper family    quite capable of thriving and multiplying with great speed    entirely by itself. About all you should have to do after    that is harvest some of its foliage from time to time which,    interestingly enough, seems only to encourage the plant to    grow even faster.<br />    <br />    "I never have to weed or feed my watercress or worry about    insect control for the plants," says Wulf. "At least not here    in New Jersey, although I have heard that sow bugs sometimes    damage the cress down in Virginia. Up here, though,    watercress seems virtually immune to both disease and insect    damage. Maybe that's because its thick beds are such    naturally good homes for frogs, crayfish, and other aquatic    life that eat plant-damaging and disease-carrying insects of    all kinds."<br />    <br />    During the winter, the leaves of Wulf's watercress stay at or    near the surface of the water bubbling from the Knausenberger    spring ... and Wulf harvests them by snipping off the upper    part of the plants with a pair of scissors or a knife    (carefully, so their roots won't be dislodged).<br />    <br />    By late spring-just about the time the first lettuce is ready    in the garden and my friend is hankerin' for a switch to some    other salad makin's anyway-the cress grows as much as a foot    out of the water and becomes too coarse and too peppery for    most folks' taste. This is also the time of the year that it    produces hundreds of tiny white flowers ... which attract    bees ... that, in turn, busily begin to convert the    watercress's pollen into a particularly tasty honey.<br />    <br />    Once these blooms have passed their prime, Wulf pulls most of    the overgrown water plants from the spring (leaving just a    few to expand into next fall and winter's crop), and adds    them to his compost pile. And that once-a-year thinning is    all the attention (other than harvesting, of course) that    Knausenberger ever gives his cress. As I've already pointed    out, watercress is an awfully easy plant to raise when you    have a steadily flowing spring on your property.<br />    <br />    As a matter of fact, if that spring is big enough and wells    up out of a limestone base, you might even consider going    into the watercress business commercially. Local    supermarkets, hotels, and restaurants are-of course-your    logical markets ... and you must line those markets up before    you begin deliveries, since cress tends to be perishable once    it's cut. Farmer's Bulletin 2233 (available from your county    agricultural agent) contains more detailed information about    setting up and operating such a business.<br />    <br />    And if you have no spring of clear, pure water at all? No    problem. You probably won't be able to do it commercially,    but you can still raise enough watercress for your    family.<br />    <br />    Take a fair-sized fish tank, put a small amount of good    compost and soil in its bottom, and poke in a few slips of    watercress (Nasturtium officinale). The stems should quickly    root themselves and be off and running. Other than cutting    away a few plant tops from time to time for salads, you    should have to do little for the cress but siphon out the    tank's old water whenever it becomes cloudy and refill the    container with fresh.</p>
