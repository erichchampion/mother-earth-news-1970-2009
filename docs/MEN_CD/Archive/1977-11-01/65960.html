                    <h5 id="byline">      by JO FROHBIETER MUELLER    </h5>        <p>      Making stained, leaded glass items is a snap ... and      selling them is even easier. I know because, until six      months ago, my husband and I had never even touched a piece      of stained glass. And now ... now we have thirteen windows,      several lamps, an assortment of suncatchers, and many other      items to our credit. And, even when we quote "uptown"      prices for our "out in the sticks" work, Wayne and I are      amazed at the number of folks who seem eager to purchase      our stained glass handiwork.    </p>    <h3>WE GOT INTO THE CRAFT BY ACCIDENT</h3>    <p>      Actually, we never intended to make this a full or even a      part-time business (we still don't), since my husband and I      are both employed and we both already have far too many      homestead, gardening, writing, and other projects started      as it is. Like so many others (as we've since learned), all      we <em>really</em> wanted to do a half year ago was buy a      stained glass window for our home.    </p>    <p>      But that was easier said than done. No matter how hard we      looked, we couldn't seem to find a single available stained      glass window. "Aha! " we told each other, "We'll run an ad      in the newspaper. That'll turn up something." So we took      out the ad ... and drew a complete blank. Not a single soul      answered.    </p>    <p>      "Well, to heck with <em>buying</em> a window, then," we      said. "We'll just get a stained glass how-to book and      <em>make</em> our own."    </p>    <p>      And, as we soon proved to our own surprise, that was almost      easier done than said. The following brief rundown of what      we now know about making and selling stained glass work is      certainly not an exhaustive treatise on the subject. But it      is more than enough information to get you started in the      craft.    </p>   <h3>TYPES AND SOURCES OF GLASS</h3>    <p>      Some stained glass pieces are assembled from stock that is      cut to shape, while others are formed from unfaceted glass      nuggets formed somewhat like drop cookies (that is, with      rounded surfaces and flat bottoms). The slight curvature of      the glass in these globs causes light to reflect, making      the drops particularly useful in suncatchers (small,      decorative, multi-colored designs that are hung up in      windows). These large glass "beads" can be bought at craft      stores ... but I've found that their prices can range all      the way from lit for the 1/20 and 3/4" nuggets (50 for the      1-1/2" size) to 30c for a single globule. It pays to shop      around!    </p>    <p>      Although large sheets of colored glass cost a bundle,      smaller chunks-which work fine for most projects-can be      bought from stained glass companies or art glass studios      for a nominal sum. These sources usually sell broken glass      by the pound and allow you to dig through their scrap pile      to find the best pieces ... remember, though, to wear      leather gloves while you rummage in the heap so you won't      cut yourself.    </p>   <h3>BASIC TOOLS</h3>    <p>      Colored glass is scored with a Fletcher No. 6 or 7 glass      cutter, your basic working tool ... which costs only about      $1.10!    </p>    <p>      Besides the cutter, you'll need an inexpensive soldering      iron and one or two pairs of pliers. A 40- to 80-watt iron      works best. If you happen to have one with a higher      wattage, however, you can use it if you either unplug the      utensil when it gets too hot, or put a rheostat in the line      to control its temperature. As a last resort, you could      even get by with a woodburning iron, but this requires a      finer solder than is normally used.    </p>    <h3>SOLDER AND FLUX</h3>    <p>      When you go out to buy solder, pick up the 60/40 type ...      which means 60% tin and 40% lead. This combination of      metals melts quickly, yet produces a strong bond. (50/50      will be your second choice when the first is unavailable.)      A one-pound spool will get you started, and should cost      around $5.00.    </p>    <p>      While you're at the hardware store, purchase a four-ounce      bottle of liquid flux (about $1.50), too. <em>It is      absolutely essential that you brush this fluid onto the      lead that you'll be mounting your pieces of glass in just      before you solder each joint</em> (otherwise the solder      won't adhere properly). There are several kinds of flux,      but you should buy either oleic acid or zinc and ammonium      chloride.    </p>   <h3> LEAD</h3>    <p>      The only other supply you'll need is lead came, which comes      in various sizes and shapes and which is used to surround      the edges of each piece of glass-with the lead joints      soldered together-as the assembly grows.    </p>    <p>      Since your beginning stained glass pieces will probably be      rather small, the first came you buy should be no larger      than 1/8" . . . preferably 3/32" (which is easier to handle      and looks especially good on the smaller items).    </p>    <p>      Wherever you buy your supplies of glass, ask for a six-foot      length (about $1.00) each of 1/8- or 3/16-inch "H"- and      1/8- or 3/16-inch "U"-shape channeled lead came and the      dealer will know exactly what you mean. The "H"-shaped      strip is used as a common border whenever two pieces of      glass are butted together, and the "U" channel will be run      around the outer edges of the whole project (Fig. 1).    </p>    <h3>HOW TO CUT GLASS</h3>    <p>      There was a short but very complete article on cutting      glass in MOTHER NO. 38 (see pages 9495). Get the issue and      look it up. In the meantime, here are some additional tips.    </p>    <p>      Before you begin, lay a piece of heavy cloth (I use a hunk      of old velvet) on your worktable to cushion the glass and      catch any splinters that might scatter. Then hold the      cutter between your first and second fingers with your      thumb positioned along its back (Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      Now press down against the glass (not <em>too</em> hard)      and pull the tool toward your body without hesitation.      Don't hunch down over the table because this tends to      inhibit the natural flow of movement that you'll need when      you cut. As the little wheel rolls toward you, you'll hear      a crackle-like sound.    </p>    <p>      Never, never, <em>never,</em> go back over the cut line      since it will damage your tool and chip the glass. Instead,      <em>immediately</em> after the glass is scored, hold it on      either side of the cut line (use pliers to grip the glass      if it's too small to hold with your fingers) or position      the scored mark along the edge of the table ... and snap      the glass in two. You'd be wise to practice on an old      window pane or other expendable piece of glass, and      graduate to colored stock only after you learn to cut and      break with precision.    </p>  <h3>PUT IT ALL TOGETHER</h3>    <p>      Now you're ready to tackle a real project. Set up your      worktable (I usually put mine in front of the fireplace      where the stained glass picks up the dancing light of the      blaze) and sketch out a pattern (maybe something simple but      fun like the apple, bug, or pea pod suncatchers shown in      one of the accompanying photos).    </p>    <p>      Once it's drawn, transfer a carbon copy of the design onto      either poster board or heavy paper and cut out the      individual segments. Next, fill the sections of the outline      with cut glass or selected glass nuggets, and wrap each      piece in lead came. (The came can be snipped to size with      ordinary scissors ... and remember to use the "H" shape on      glass that abuts, and the "U" channel around the outer      edges of the design.)    </p>    <p>      Now brush flux onto the lead at each joint, and solder. A      little practice and patience will reveal how much solder to      use and how hot the iron should be. You'll find that      sometimes a third hand is just what you need to hold      several pieces of glass in position at once as you solder      ... and a little modeling clay- strategically placed-will      do that job just fine. Finally, if the object is a      suncatcher that will be suspended in a window, add a tiny      hanger wire through the lead.    </p>    <p>      Forget "cute" gimmicky designs if you're thinking of      marketing your work. They get "stale" and "wear out" too      fast. Instead, study the qualities of the glass you work      with before jumping into a project ... and then try to use      those qualities to project a timeless beauty. When you can      do <em>that, I</em> guarantee you'll have more buyers      clamoring for your work than you'll know what to do with!    </p>   <h3>SELL WHAT YOU MAKE!</h3>          <p>      You'll be surprised to learn how much money a stained glass      article can bring. For example, a cluster of grapes that      you've assembled for about 35c will easily bring $6.95 in a      craft shop!    </p>    <p>      But why split the profit? If you live anywhere near      civilization, put out a sign and sell right from your home.      Make the house feel warm and inviting by keeping something      "country" (maybe spiced applesauce or vegetable soup)      brewing on the stove ... and offer your potential customers      a cup of herb tea. Folks are always more inclined to make a      purchase after they've relaxed for a few minutes and      chatted with the "artist" (that's you! ).    </p>    <p>      And if you're off the beaten path? Try asking a grocer and      other business people in town if you can hang a sign with a      map to your place in their store windows. Offer the      shopkeepers a couple of free stained glass items to go over      the announcements (they'll love 'em ... and the suncatchers      will make your sign just that much more effective), and you      should have little trouble placing the notices.    </p>   <h3> AND DON'T SELL "CHEAP"!</h3>    <p>      By now you know that it takes fine taste and artistry to      produce attractive stained glass work ... so don't sell      your items "cheap"! There's definitely a lively demand for      this craft and you're entitled to both a designer's and a      manufacturer's profit (maybe even a retailer's one too!)      when you create attractive stained glass items.    </p>    <p>      So go after those profits! And then plow all the first ones      right back into more supplies and all the advertising      (which, of course, stresses the <em>handcrafted</em> nature      of your work) you can afford. It won't hurt, either, to      give your stained glass works a name that's so ab solutely      "catchy" - - . that city people (who love to make such      "discoveries") will just <em>have</em> to drive out and      browse around.    </p>   <h3>START SMALL, GROW BIG</h3>    <p>      Limit yourself, in the very beginning, to attractive      suncatchers and other small items that you can turn out on      a regular bread-and-butter basis while you sharpen your      stained glass skills. Then, as you develop more expertise,      you can experiment with windows, ornate lamps, and other      bigger projects. And beware: Once you've mastered the      latter, your customers will start asking for "made to      order" and "custom" objects of all kinds (which, if I have      to tell you, is where the <em>really</em> important money      is in most artistic fields),    </p>    <p>      A word of caution, however: Don't even pick up that first      piece of colored glass unless you have some extra time on      your hands. Because once you've tried this craft, the odds      are good that you're gonna be hooked for a long, long time      ... as my husband and I have found out. See, about six      months ago, we decided we'd like to have a stained glass      window, so ....    </p>   <h3>Further Information</h3>    <p>      If you'd like to learn more about working with stained      glass, check out these references:    </p>    <p>      <em>1.
