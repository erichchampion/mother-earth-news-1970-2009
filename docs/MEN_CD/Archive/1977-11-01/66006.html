                       <h5 id="byline">by HI SIBLEY</h5>        <p>      I step right out my back door into a fisherman's paradise.      It's a small, homebuilt water hole so overflowing with      mouthwatering bluegills that I can take out as many as 30      to 40 at a time.    </p>        <p>      A home fish pond is easy to build because it needn't be      fancy-fish aren't fussy. Soon you have hours of relaxing      fun as well as fresh, golden panfish such as you've never      tasted before.    </p>    <p>      My pond is simply a shallow, irregular saucer scooped out      by a tractor with a blade. No bulldozer is necessary. The      sides are lined with a 1-2-3 mix of concrete. A bed of sand      or gravel and steel reinforcing mesh is advisable in frost      areas. A drainpipe allows water to be drawn off and      replaced to keep the pond fresh. A tub of water lilies      provides cool shade for the fish on hot days.    </p>    <p>      To stock the pond, fingerlings can be obtained      inexpensively at any state hatchery. I bought bluegills      because they multiply like crazy. In a small pond, some      extra food is required to supplement the natural      supply-about a pound of chopped liver a week. The      fish love it. U.S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin No.      1983 gives valuable. information on raising fish in home      ponds.    </p>
