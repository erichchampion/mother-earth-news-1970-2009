        Log dogs can be made by the some welder. Use 314-inch-square steel about 36 inches long. Sharpen each end to a chisel point and bond about three Inches of each end down. These, when driven into the building at one end and Into the log on which you are working at the other end, will hold it firmly in place. A smaller and lighter pair of log dogs, about 12 or 14 inches long, is also very handy.
