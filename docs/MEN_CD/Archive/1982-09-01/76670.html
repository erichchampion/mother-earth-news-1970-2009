            		        <p>      The institute for Local Self-Reliance works to help urban      residents gain greater control over their lives through the      use of low-technology, decentralist tools and concepts.      Because we believe that city dwellers and country folks      alike can profit from the institute's admirable efforts,      we've made this "what's happening where" report by the ILSR      staffers one of MOTHER's regular features. If you would      like to know more, you can have a free catalog of ILSR's      selection of books and pamphlets by sending the institute a      self-addressed, stamped envelope . . . or become an      associate member for a tax-deductible $35 per year ($50 for      institutions) and receive both a periodic report on the      institute's work and a 20% discount on all the group's      publications. Write to ILSR, Dept. TMEN, 1717 18th Street      N. W., Washington, D. C. 20009.    </p>    <p>      Philadelphia, called the cradle of liberty for its role in      America's fight for independence, is today the scene of      another kind of revolution: In dozens of that city's chain      grocery stores, checkout clerks and other "ordinary"      employees are becoming owners. And ironically enough, the      parent of this experiment in worker ownership is none other      than A & P . . . the company that pioneered the concept      of the modern, corporation-controlled supermarket back in      1912.    </p>    <p>      The chain's halcyon days were limited, however. In 1969 A      & P was still number one in domestic sales among all      retail food outlets, but the firm - now an "old      timer" - had grown fat and sloppy with success. Soon,      hungry new competitors - such as Safeway and Kroger      - overtook the giant . . . and by 1975 A & P had      fallen to fourth place.    </p>    <p>      It wasn't long before large corporate losses began to pile      up, so - in an attempt to stop them - A & P      began to close many of its stores . . . and between 1974      and early 1982 it reduced the number of its locations from      3,468 to 1,055. However, each time the company shut down an      outlet, it was forced to lay off first those people who had      worked the shortest time, who - generally speaking      - were the younger and lowest-paid employees . . .      and to retain those with seniority and, usually, larger      paychecks.    </p>    <p>      As a result, the firm's actual per-worker labor costs      remained extraordinarily high (the industry norm for annual      wages is just under 10% of total revenue, while A & P      was paying 15%). Furthermore, the reduction in employees      led to poorer customer service . . ..and the corporation      found itself in a vicious downward spiral caused by low      sales and high overhead, which - today -      continues to seriously threaten the future of the      once-great chain. A ray of hope, however, has begun to      shine in the Philadelphia region.    </p>    <p>      In the spring of 1982, Philadelphia's United Food and      Commercial Workers union locals called laid-off A & P      personnel to a series of educational meetings on the      subject of employee ownership. The Philadelphia Association      of Cooperative Enterprise (PACE) acted as an advisor . . .      and nearly 200 people pledged $5,000 each for a share in      one of the reopened stores. With those funds as a basis,      the union submitted a bid to A & P of $4 million for a      block of 17 stores.    </p>    <p>      The chain's management responded with a counteroffer: A      & P agreed to transfer ownership of 20 of the ill-fated      supermarkets to a new subsidiary, Super Fresh Food Centers,      with provisions that would allow an employees' cooperative      organization at each of the locations to gradually buy the      store. Furthermore, A & P established "quality circles"      - committees of workers and supervisors - to      give participants a stronger voice in management and to      provide a forum for exchanging ideas.    </p>    <p>      The workers, in turn, agreed to reduce their vacations from      as much as four weeks to a maximum of just one week . . .      and took pay cuts of up to $2.00 an hour.    </p>    <p>      Under the arrangement, A & P will give each cooperative      a 1% share of that store's gross sales . . as long as the      members together hold labor costs at all 20 locations to a      level of 10% of operating revenue. If the payroll      percentage figure goes up, the workers' cut will be      decreased proportionately . . . while if salaries should      fall below 10%, the share to the cooperative will be      increased.    </p>    <p>      About half of the gross sales fund will be distributed as      employee bonuses, and the remainder will go into a master      account for buying additional stores. In the first year of      operation, this nest egg could yield as much as $1.5      million, which in turn could be used to borrow up to $9      million for new purchases.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, in direct contrast to the "old way" of doing      business at A & P, each store will operate      <em>independently</em> of the others. Employees who wish to      become members of a cooperative simply invest $5,000 apiece      (the union will continue to represent workers, but cannot,      itself, own any of the outlets) . . . and anyone who wants      to join but has trouble coming up with the fee can get help      through the company's credit union or through payroll      deduction financing. In the event that an individual leaves      the cooperative, he or she will receive the initial $5,000      plus a share of whatever profits have accumulated to that      point.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, other cities and corporations are watching the      endeavor with interest. Perhaps A & P - a company      once accused of driving "mom and pop" stores out of      existence - will become the progenitor of a new      generation of employee-managed enterprises. And these will      be <em>neighborhood-based</em> businesses . . . rooted in      and responsive to their communities, owned and operated by      the workers themselves, and keeping local dollars in the      local economy. This is the vision fostered by the      Philadelphia experiment.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For a superb account of today's urban      woes</em> - <em>and a comprehensive, innovative      proposal for remedying those problems</em> -      <em>you'll want to read Self-Reliant Cities by David      Morris, founder and president of ILSR.
