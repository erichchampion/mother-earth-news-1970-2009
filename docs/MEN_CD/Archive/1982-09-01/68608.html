                <p>      <em>Defeathering fowl is rarely considered a pleasant chore      . . . but the following tips should help you get the birds      from the game bag (or chopping block) to the oven with a      minimum of trouble.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by John Krill    </h5>         			<p>      I used to dread the moment after a bird hunt when -      back at home - I'd carry my bag of pheasants, grouse,      or waterfowl into the kitchen to ready them for the evening      meal. Plucking a stone-cold bird that had been stored all      day in the bottom of a canoe or (even worse) in the pocket      of my hunting coat was no easy task . . . and all too often      the <em>results</em> of my defeathering handiwork looked      mighty unappetizing. (In fact, I'm embarrassed to say that      some of those tablefare hopefuls never made it past the      kitchen!) However, I've since discovered a method of      plucking fowl - whether the bird is brought down in      the wild or culled from a homestead flock - that not      only is easy to do, but also turns out downright      eye-appealing roastables.    </p>    <p>      Once a bird is cold, you see, the roots of the feathers      become locked in the tightened flesh . . . so when the      critter is plucked, bits of skin come off, too, resulting      in a rather patchy pièce de résistance. In      order to reduce the tearing of the skin, veteran      feather-pullers use wet heat, most often in the form of a      quick scalding, to free the tenacious plumage. I do the      same . . . but mine is a two-step technique.    </p>    <p>      To get the defeathering operation underway, you'll first      need a pot that's big enough to allow you to submerge the      bird entirely. Fill the vat at least to the halfway point      with water and set it on the stove. (If you have only one      or two birds to pluck, you can probably work in the      kitchen. When there's a whole slew of feathered fowl to be      processed, though, you might want to build an outdoor      fire-and-pot apparatus . . . to make the cleanup chores      easier.) While the water is heating, add two tablespoons of      dishwashing detergent for each bucketful of liquid . . .      the cleaner decreases the surface tension of the water and      allows it to penetrate the feathers more thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      Now, let the water reach a temperature of 140° to      160°F. (Overscalding could cause the bird's skin to      tear . . . but remember that too <em>little</em> heat will      make the feathers difficult to pull free.) Then dunk the      carcass head first (hold the feet) into the hot bath for 60      to 90 seconds. If your pot is large enough, draw the bird      backwards through the water while it's submerged, in order      to force the heated liquid through the feathers and under      the wings for a more thorough soaking. Then let the scalded      clucker drain on sheets of clean newspaper.    </p>    <p>      At this point, most pluckers will begin the task of tugging      out the feathers . . . however, I've found that even after      dipping the bird in hot water, the skin may still tear. So      I take the wet-heat process one step further . . . and give      my dinner-to-be the "steam room" treatment.    </p>    <p>      To do so, simply soak two oblong sponges (or wads of clean      rags) in the hot water, and tuck one of the compresses      under each wing. Then place the drenched bird - with      the sponges still in place - on a large, thick      section of newsprint, wrap it up like a package, and pop      the whole works into a plastic bag to help retain the heat      and moisture.    </p>    <p>      Let the bird remain in this "hotbox" for about 20 minutes      before carefully unwrapping the bundle. While the fowl is      still warm, you can begin plucking the wing feathers (these      are the toughest to pull out, so you'll want to get them      first), and continue by picking the plumes from the tail,      legs, neck, back, and - last - the breast.      Always remove the feathers by pulling steadily on the      quills rather than jerking them out, and be sure to pluck      in the direction in which the feathers lie.    </p>    <p>      After the bird has been picked over once, you'll need to      pull off any remaining pinfeathers and - if the      specimen you're working on is a waterfowl - take care      of the down undercoat . . . which will usually come off      fairly easily if you simply scrape a thumb or bladed      implement against the carcass. The pinfeathers may prove to      be more of a problem. Try prying the stubborn bits of quill      out with a paring knife, or use a pair of tweezers.    </p>    <p>      With those tasks accomplished, you may notice a few hairs      still on the bird. It's easy to singe off these strands by      passing the carcass over an open flame . . . or - if      you'd rather - by using a propane torch. (Do it      rapidly so that you don't begin to <em>cook</em> the fowl      in the process.)    </p>    <p>      At this point the stripped clucker should be smooth and      featherless. Your prettily plucked fowl can now go on to      command a prominent place in the evening's repast . . . and      it'll look every bit as good as it tastes!    </p>
