                <p>      <em>Do you want to build some affordable luxuries for your      home and yard? You can do it by . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by      Jean and Michael Morford    </h5>    <p>      If your household budget has taken the kind of battering      that ours has over the past couple of years, you probably      aren't often able to come up with any extra money to spend      on such "frivolous" projects as building a picnic table for      the back yard or a bookcase for the family room. After all,      what with the price of' wood these days, it's hard enough      to find the wherewithal to purchase lumber for the jobs      that are <em>essential</em> to running a home or farm.    </p>    <p>      So what options does a frugal family have? Well, you could      do as we did and make use of an all but untapped source of      inexpensive boards: forklift skids, or pallets, the      cratelike platforms that are used in the loading ofheavy      freight.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FORAGED</strong> <strong>FACTORY      RESOURCE</strong>    </p>        <p>      Pallets can provide a fine source of lowcost lumber, and      they're often found - sometimes even discarded and      free for the hauling - around rural dumps, factory or      warehouse loading docks, newspaper offices, or anyplace      where heavy loads are stored or moved. (Don't forget,      though, to obtain permission before foraging your lumber.      There may be a charge . . . or that pile you're looking at      might still be in use!)    </p>    <p>      If we had to guess why pallets are thrown away, we'd      venture to say it's because they're pretty darn hard to      take apart for recycling. . . but <em>hard</em> - as      all of you make - doers know-ain't necessarily      impossible! And if you're a budget-conscious individual who      wants to be able to add some extras around the house,      you'll likely decide - as we did - that the      amount of muscle flexing and patience it takes to      <em>de</em> construct a skid is well worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UNCONSTRUCTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although pallets are built in various sizes (to suit the      load they're meant to carry), they all take basically the      same form. They start with thick (1-1/2" to 3-1/4") planks,      4 feet or so in length, called stringers . . . above and      below which are nailed four or more boards (anywhere from      1/4" to 1-1/2" thick and, again, about 4 feet long) called      decking (see Fig. 1). The single unusual construction      aspect of a typical skid - <em>and</em> the reason      most people don't go to the trouble of taking the platforms      apart - is the fact that it's fastened together with      machine-driven <em>grooved</em> nails . . . which are      designed to be pretty clanged difficult to pull out.    </p>        <p>      <strong>FIG. 1 A SKID</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>FIG. 2 TAKING IT APART</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANS OF ATTACK</strong>    </p>    <p>      Upon discovering our first batch of pallets, we decided      that there was so much good lumber in the critters that we      had to at least <em>try</em> to pull them apart. And      - as we quickly learned - the best way to      approach the task is to have a few battle plans up your      sleeve . . . if one method doesn't work, another might.    </p>    <p>      <em>Plan</em> <em>1:</em> Try <em>unscrewing</em> those      grooved nails. Who knows . . . you might just get lucky.      However, chances are you'll have to move on to      <em>Plan</em> <em>2:</em> Take a hammer and try to knock      the decking boards off the stringers by whacking them from      underneath. (This will require some muscle power, and      you'll have to be careful that you don't split the boards      - rendering them useless as lumber - in the      process.)    </p>    <p>      If neither of those techniques will work, you'll have to      proceed to the <em>Plan of Last Resort</em> . Get out your      power or chain saw and <em>cut</em> the decking just inside      the outer stringers . . . then - to remove the      shrunken planks from the middle support - seesaw them      back and forth (as shown in Fig. 2) until they finally pull      loose. (You might have to employ a crowbar to help with      this step.)    </p>    <p>      Sure, the boards that result will be short, but you'll      still have a fine reward for your efforts. The wood will be      usable as is for some purposes, or you can sand the rough      surfaces and patch the nail holes with wood filler for      finer work.    </p>    <p>      We've even found that the center stringers - when      stripped of nails - can be shaved down to produce      sturdy tool handles . . . and of course, <em>all</em> the      scraps can be stored for firewood.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, then - provided you find the idea of      a little labor "pallet-able" - it <em>is</em>      possible to acquire a supply of inexpensive lumber for      almost any project you might dream up!    </p>
