                        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us - for      instance - have read Paul's book</em> The Population      Bomb <em>) . . few people have any idea of how deeply the      Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research (the type that      tends to be published only in technical journals and      college texts). That's why we're pleased to present this      regular semitechnical column by these well-known      authors/ecologists/educators.</em>    </p>       <h5 id="byline">      by Paul and Anne Ehrlich    </h5>    <p>      As we've pointed out in our last few columns, most of this      planet's animals, plants, and micro-organisms can be      effectively saved from extinction only if they're allowed      to reproduce in their natural settings. Therefore, the      ability to conserve populations and species boils down      - for all intents and purposes - to the ability      to conserve habitat.    </p>    <p>      Now the broad outlines concerning just how this      <em>should</em> be accomplished are simple in principle.      First of all, <em>no</em> more virgin land should be      developed anywhere. There are already plenty of disturbed      areas available to fill the needs of people . . . if human      population growth is brought under control in as rapid and      humane a manner as possible.    </p>    <p>      It's true, of course, that there is currently a shortage of      decent housing in the United States, but that problem could      be remedied by the high-density redevelopment of such      places as the South Bronx, Spanish Harlem, and East Los      Angeles. In a similar vein, the additional food required by      poor countries could likely be obtained through the use of      an ecologically sound intensification of agriculture,      rather than by bringing more marginal land under      cultivation (and most of the acreage that is now      uncultivated <em>is</em> agriculturally marginal).    </p>    <p>      As a first step, the few remaining undisturbed lands of      Earth should be transformed into reserves, with human      access to them strictly controlled. Furthermore, such areas      would have to be protected not only from activities like      building, mining, logging, and off-road vehicle travel but      also from the more subtle threats of air pollution, acid      rain, and pesticide drift. (The atmosphere, you see,      doesn't respect human-made territorial boundaries.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>NOT GOOD ENOUGH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the creation of such a reserve system      wouldn't, by itself, be enough to guarantee the      preservation of Earth's biological riches . . . because      much of the diversity originally contained in reserves will      be lost, once such areas become "islands". In order to      understand <em>why</em> that would happen, we'll have to      make a short excursion into an area called "island      biogeography". Some 15 years ago, two leading ecologists      - the late Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson      (of "sociobiology" fame) - postulated that the number      of species on an island normally remains more or less      constant, and is determined primarily by two factors:      successful colonization by new species and extinction of      old ones.    </p>    <p>      The two scientists concluded that - everything else      being equal - the larger the number of species, the      higher would be the rate of extinction . . . since the      island would then be more crowded and the population size      of each species, on the average, would be smaller. On the      other hand, the fewer the residents, the easier it would be      for "colonist" species to find space to settle in.    </p>    <p>      Additionally, the rate of extinction would be influenced by      such factors as island size . . . that is, the smaller the      island, the higher the extinction rate would probably be.      The arrival rate of potential colonists also would vary      with the size of the island, since random wanderers would      be more likely to "hit" a large target than a small one.      And, of course, distance from the nearest mainland would      also be important in determining the flow of immigrants.    </p>    <p>      This "equilibrium theory" makes sense . . . and it's      supported by some actual data. For instance, the 1883      explosion of the volcano Krakatoa created a wasteland that      was slowly recolonized. The number of bird species there      gradually increased from zero to 27 . . . where it has      stayed, even though five of the first 27 species went      extinct (that is, the <em>island's</em> population died      out) and were replaced by five <em>other</em> varieties.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"ISLAND" SURVIVAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Any area of the planet's surface can be thought of as being      similar to an island . . . with the composition of its      flora and fauna determined by rates of colonization and      extinction of species. With that in mind, then, picture      what happens when a nature reserve is established and      becomes isolated from other similar areas by extensive      intervening terrain made up of, say, farmland.    </p>    <p>      Immediately, the extinction rate in the reserve will start      to rise, as the area will almost certainly be too small to      support as many populations as were once supported by the      larger habitat area that formerly surrounded it.      Individuals of species that were at first present -      because they were part of a larger population that occupied      an area bigger than the preserve - will start to      disappear.    </p>    <p>      At the same time, the inflow of potential colonist      varieties will dwindle, because the surrounding farmland      presents a barrier to the movement of individuals. Since      the extinction rate will be up, and the colonization rate      down, the number of species at equilibrium will be reduced.      This means that the flora and fauna will become less      diverse.    </p>    <p>      Ten thousand years ago - when the great glaciers of      the last ice age melted and the sea levels rose -      just such a relaxation, or reduction in diversity, occurred      among the mammal fauna found in certain Asian areas that      became islands. In fact, none of these "new" islands      - even the very large ones - were able to      retain the entire spectrum of fauna found on the Asian      mainland. Judging by what happened there, then, it's quite      possible to predict what would happen if all present      African game parks should become completely isolated      "islands". About <em>half</em> of the large mammal species      would be lost from the average reserve in some 500 years,      and there would be less predictable - but doubtless      substantial - losses among other groups of animals      and plants, as well.    </p>    <p>      It's plain, then, that the maintenance of only one or a few      small reserves in each land region would be a hopelessly      inadequate measure to protect the present diversity of life      for any length of time. Even under the most careful      protection, small, deeply isolated reserves would gradually      suffer enormous losses of species. And large ones, even if      they included connecting corridors to other reserves, could      be expected to have significant losses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOUGHTFUL DEVELOPMENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since our goal should be to preserve as much as possible of      the planet's biological diversity more or less permanently,      it would obviously be unwise to place all our eggs in the      admittedly fragile reserve basket. Developed and disturbed      areas must also be made more hospitable to organisms other      than humankind . . . in order to permit more and larger      populations to be maintained and to provide corridors for      migrants to travel when passing between the fully protected      reserve areas.    </p>    <p>      There are many ways that this could be accomplished.      Diversity could be introduced to tree farms, for instance.      Contrary to present practice, several species should be      planted together, and shrubs and herbs might be encouraged      to grow beneath the trees. In addition, the use of      hedgerows or windbreaks between farm fields should become      standard practice, as should the setting aside of woodlots      in agricultural areas.    </p>    <p>      Under such a redevelopment program, city parks, vacant      lots, and the "roughs" of golf courses would be planted      with native species, while exotic weeds would be suppressed      wherever possible. Lawns would be replaced with natural      landscaping. The herbiciding of roadsides and powerline      right-of-ways would have to stop, too, as would the lining      of streams with concrete.    </p>    <p>      Wherever possible, efforts would be made to restore      disturbed areas to nearly natural habitats. The ecosystem      that once occupied an overgrazed mountain range, strip      mine, parking lot, or building site can never be precisely      replaced, but - with effort - useful ecosystems      could be established in such places . . . ecosystems that      would contain a wide variety of native organisms.    </p>    <p>      Most important, though, <em>any</em> program to conserve      biological diversity must include a reduction in the      burning of fossil fuels (which is the root cause of acid      rain) and the institution of the strictest emission      controls when such fuels <em>are</em> used. Limitations in      the use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers must also      be incorporated in the plan . . . as well as provisions for      spreading the practice of soil conservation and for      bringing an end to overgrazing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONSERVATION'S "IRON LAWS"</strong>    </p>    <p>      All of these measures may be thought of as the necessary      <em>tactics</em> of conservation. However, their      implementation will require a <em>strategy</em> as well . .      . one that, we believe, should be based on five "Iron Laws      of Conservation".    </p>    <p>      [1] In conservation, there is only successful defense or      retreat . . . never a true advance. A species or an      ecosystem, once destroyed, cannot be restored.    </p>    <p>      [2] Conservation and continued growth of human population      are fundamentally incompatible.    </p>    <p>      [3] Conservation and a growthmanic economic system are also      fundamentally incompatible.    </p>    <p>      [4] The notion that only the short-term goals and immediate      happiness of <em>Homo sapiens</em> should be considered in      making moral decisions about the use of Earth is lethal . .      . not only to nonhuman organisms but to humanity as well.    </p>    <p>      [5] Arguments that support the right of nonhuman life-forms      to exist or that focus on their aesthetic value and      intrinsic interest - as well as appeals to compassion      for what may be our only living companions in the universe      - now mostly fall on deaf ears. Until our species'      ethical and aesthetic attitudes evolve further,      conservation must be promoted as an issue of <em>human</em>      well-being and, in the long run, human survival.    </p>    <p>      Thus, preserving the diversity of life will entail a      changed relationship not only between human beings and      their environment, but also among people. Our population      growth must be halted as soon as possible and a gradual      decline begun. The economic system must be reorganized . .      . so that it's oriented toward <em>sustaining</em> society      rather than toward maintaining perpetual growth. The gap      between rich and poor must be narrowed . . . not simply      because it's the moral thing to do, but because it's      essential that it be done if we're to avoid nuclear war and      preserve diversity. (Remember, the poor countries "own"      that most precious resource, our planet's species-rich      tropical forests.)    </p>    <p>      Most of all, time must be gained to complete the revolution      in ethics that will assure the right of all other organisms      to exist . . . and to insure that such a right is not      casually violated. For the last century, humanity has been      moving in the right direction . . . as demonstrated, for      example, by the increasing public concern for whales and      the institution of laws to protect animals against cruelty.      But we have a long way to go before such basic rights are      extended to <em>all</em> living things.    </p>    <p>      We believe that such an ethical revolution holds the      <em>only</em> real promise of conserving Earth's living      diversity in the long run. All people must become aware of      the needs and rights of other beings . . . and aware that      humanity is both morally and physically dependent on those      creatures.    </p>    <p>      The tactics and strategy outlined here may seem extremely      impractical in a society caught up in the silliness of      "supply-side economics". Yet such a program is crucial to      the persistence of <em>all</em> of this planet's economic      systems, dependent as they are on the continuance of      ecosystem services. We hope that what seems impractical      today will be recognized as imperative a decade from now.    </p>    <p>      Any less comprehensive change - or any great delay      - is likely to mean that the job won't get done. And      then our own species will pay the price along with the      others.    </p>    <p>      More information on the preservation of diversity can be      found in <em>Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the      Disappearance of Species</em> by Paul and Anne Ehrlich      (Random House, 1981, $15.95).
