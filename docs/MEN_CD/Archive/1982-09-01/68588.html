        <p><strong>POPEYE WAS RIGHT:</strong> Three Ohio State University scientists have developed a chemical solar battery that uses spinach chloroplasts - the substances that transform sunlight into electron - rich chemicals as part of the plant's foodmaking process-to generate electricity. The spinach cell's efficiency of 1.7% compares favorably with the 0.1% typical of other chemical solar batteries . . . and if the vegetable device's efficiency ever reaches 5%, it will actually be competitive with photovoltaics.</p><p><strong>CULTIVATED EELS:</strong> A Swedish sulfuric acid plant - whose <em>high</em> -grade waste heat is already being utilized by a municipality - will soon begin growing eels in water that's been warmed by the facility's <em>low</em> -grade discarded BTU. Preliminary tests show that the eels reach almost 1-1/2 pounds each during their first year when raised in the warmed-to-75°F ocean water.</p><p><strong>NUKE NOTES:</strong> In 1981 the U.S. ranked thirteenth among 19 nations in terms of nuclear-plant operating success, with 77 of the country's licensed reactors operating at an average of only 56.4% of capacity. When nuclear utilities are licensed, federal agencies assume that the plants will function at 70% of capacity . . . therefore, the government uses that level for making cost/benefit comparisons with other energy alternatives . . . . During February of 1982, though, 24 of the 72 "operating" nuclear power stations were out of commission because of functional problems.</p><p><strong>ZUCCHINI AS A REPLACEMENT FOR FIREWOOD?</strong> Don't get your hopes up, as did a number of readers who believed a facetious magazine account about two New York entrepreneurs who were selling split zucchini (or "Z-wood", as the men had dubbed it) for $20 a cord, including a bale of grated zucchini to be used as kindling. After being deluged with inquiries from readers, the publication 'fessed up to its joke . . . and, for the time being, the energy generated by the prolific squash is pretty much limited to that expended by gardeners trying to give away their surplus.</p><p><strong>SOLAR SENTRY:</strong> A south Florida apiarist has developed an ingenious method of thwarting the honey-loving black bears that sometimes savage remote hives: a solar-powered electric fence. The gentleman surrounds his bee colonies with electrified barbed wire connected to a solar panel/12-volt gel battery arrangement. Since the sun-powered barriers have been erected, bear depredation has occurred only when the fences have been out of commission because of equipment failure or battery theft.</p><p><strong>AGRICULTURAL ALTERNATIVES:</strong> A new 70-page federal report, <em>Energy Research for the Farm . . . An Overview</em>, examines the feasibility of developing alternative sources of agricultural power and of extending energy use in crop production. The document features more than 100 studies on wind turbines, methane digesters for livestock operations, farm-grown fuels, solar drying and heating, and more. Single copies are free, and may be obtained from the Office of Governmental and Public Affairs, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Dept. TMEN, Washington, D.C. 20250 (be sure to note that you want publication AIB 447).</p><p><strong>AN URBAN HEAT SOURCE?</strong> Geologists have discovered that the temperature of shallow ground water beneath Philadelphia may be as much as 34°F more than usual . . . and they attribute the warmth to man-made heat sources, such as the combustion of fossil fuels and heat loss from buried steam lines. Scientists estimate that some 570 trillion BTU (the equivalent of the energy that would be released by burning 98 million barrels of oil) is stored in the city's ground water and rock layers and could be recovered by heat pumps.</p><p><strong>TINY PELLETS OF STYRENE</strong>, the material of which insulated coffee cups are made, are being used for nighttime insulation in greenhouses at the Ohio Agricultural and Development Center. The system - which may be able to save 80% of the facility's heating costs - utilizes a blower that pushes millions of the minute pellets into an airtight, double-layered sheet-plastic roof every night . . . and sucks the beads out each morning.</p><p><strong>SOLAR ROTISSERIE</strong>: Hammacher Schlemmer, the New York specialty store, has introduced a novelty for the dedicated sunbather: a $4,500 solar-powered lounge chair, which rotates once every 15 minutes to promote uniform tanning.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority is conducting an air-quality study, at a plant near Oak Ridge, to develop more accurate methods of predicting how different types of terrain affect the <strong>BEHAVIOR OF EMISSIONS FROM TALL STACKS AT COAL-BURNING POWER PLANTS</strong>.... An Alamogordo, New Mexico inventor has devised a machine, dubbed the "Monster Molder", that can <strong>MASS-PRODUCE ADOBE BLOCKS</strong>. The age-old building material is experiencing an increase in popularity, but traditional hand-forming methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive .... The Solarex Corporation has completed the first of five <strong>SOLAR-POWERED MEDICAL CLINICS</strong> for a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The clinics are to be shipped to remote Third World villages where electric power isn't available .... The American Solar Energy Society has announced that it intends to <strong>PUBLISH GOVERNMENT ENERGY RESEARCH</strong> whose dissemination would otherwise be delayed as a result of curtailed government printing under reduced federal budgets. The reports will be offered for sale to the general public .... After enduring more than eight nuclear explosions over the past 25 years, the Frenchcontrolled Mururoa Atoll seems to be developing a fissure and <strong>SLOWLY SINKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC</strong> (see page 32 for related developments).</p>
