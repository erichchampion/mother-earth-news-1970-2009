                <p>      <em>Whether you live "uptown" or "down home", you can      profit from this part-time business:</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Ted Pyle    </h5>    <p>      With automobile and fuel prices climbing while the average      American's disposable income shrinks, the cars and pickup      trucks that we buy are, for the most part, getting smaller.      However, our carrying capacity requirements - whether      for work or recreation - remain as large as ever.      That being the case, it's no wonder that the market for      moderately priced, reconditioned utility trailers has never      been better.    </p>    <p>      If you're already a seasoned bargain hunter, scrounger, and      barterer (or are willing to learn how to become one), you      can get in on the trailer boom with a minimum investment      and expect returns of 25%, 50%, or even 100% on your      initial outlay. Simply use your skills to find a suitable      "reclamation project", and then to acquire building      materials . . . accumulate tires and other spare parts you      may find useful . . . and arrange for any services (such as      welding or metal cutting) that you can't perform yourself.      Reconditioning used trailers isn't especially difficult,      but it does require that you be organized - and      systematically opportunistic - in order to reap the      best returns for your time and money.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KNOW YOUR MARKET</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'm fortunate to live in a west central Oklahoma town that      boasts a four-year college and is surrounded by farm      country. The available mixture of urban, rural, and student      markets almost guarantees that I'll find a customer for any      reconditioned trailer I have to sell . . . <em>if</em> I      take the time to understand what each group of buyers will      be looking for.    </p>    <p>      Take the students, for instance. Just as the turkey      buzzards return to Hinckley, Ohio every spring, these      scholars arrive in late August and hustle home in mid-May.      So at summer's end I buy the trailers that the newly      resident undergraduates (who can always use extra cash) no      longer want . . . and in the spring I have little trouble      finding migrating collegians in desperate need of      conveyances to haul their possessions (which seem to      increase magically over the course of the school year). For      the most part, students favor two-wheelers that are      lightweight and inexpensive, with 1- to 4-foot sides and no      extras . . . something, in other words, to do little more      than get their goods and chattels home.    </p>    <p>      My other groups of customers are more choosy. Farmers and      stockbreeders, for example, tend to want sturdy, no-frills      carts capable of standing up to the punishment of carrying      agricultural equipment, feed, and fertilizer. In my      experience, such individuals are particularly eager to buy      low-profile flatbeds that measure 4 to 6 feet wide and 10      to 15 feet long. And most country buyers expect to see good      rubber on the ground and to have a spare tire thrown in      with the deal.    </p>    <p>      Townsfolk, on the other hand, seem to be more concerned      with the cosmetic aspect of a vehicle (although there are,      of course, exceptions to all of these general rules). City      and suburb dwellers are usually willing to pay top dollar      for trailers they can use to haul lawn clippings,      furniture, motorcycles, riding mowers, and such . . . but      will often ignore a bargain if it doesn't have an      attractive two-tone paint job. They also generally prefer      light- to medium-weight trailers that look sharp and have      fenders, taillights, easy-operating ball hitches, and      locking tailgates.    </p>    <p>      Finally, there's a category of customers that I call the      "hobby haulers". These people use trailers to transport      everything from artworks to motorized water skis, and are      often willing to pay premium prices to get exactly what      they want. They also tend to be very demanding. In fact,      such buyers are likely to request a custom paint scheme to      match an already owned car or truck, or any of a number of      other frills that can run into lots of time and money on      your part . . . especially if you don't have the skills and      shop equipment necessary to tackle tasks like welding and      automotive-type spray painting. Since I recondition      trailers primarily as a hobby, I pass up the hobby haulers      . . . but these individuals could represent a lucrative      market for anyone who can take the time to satisfy their      whims.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINDING AND BUYING USED TRAILERS</strong>    </p>        <p>      Once you know your market, you can go about finding the raw      material . . . that is, trailers that can be readily put      into shape. I locate most of my fixer-uppers by prowling      the streets and alleys around town, and by keeping my eyes      open when driving along country roads. If I happen to spot      a likely candidate, I simply stop and ask whether the owner      is interested in selling. (Auctions make good hunting      grounds, too, and are also economical sources of the      materials - such as paint and plywood - that      you'll need to prepare your wares for resale.)    </p>    <p>      When examining a prospect prior to making an offer on it,      be thorough. In order to be sure of a reasonable profit,      you must learn to shy away from old broken-down "dogs"      that'll require <em>too</em> much labor to be worth your      while. (Just how much repair work is too much will, of      course, depend upon your talents and upon just how the      hobby and business aspects of your enterprise balance out.)      I make sure that any trailer I purchase has a good solid      floor that isn't rusted or rotted through . . . sides that      can be easily strengthened if they aren't sound already . .      . and bearings and axles that are in good working order.    </p>    <p>      Try to avoid "boxes" built on the converted back axles of      rear-wheel-drive cars or trucks, since the      differential-equipped units are heavier than the front      shafts are, and more likely to have gear or seal problems      as well. Furthermore, if your prospective purchase has      metal sides, they should be in fairly good repair, because      body work can be both expensive and time-consuming.    </p>    <p>      Don't be ashamed to use a little "trader's psychology" when      you're negotiating a deal. Look skeptical, scratch your ear      dubiously, and mumble a bit under your breath. Maintain a      somber mien as you kick the tires, open and close the      tailgate, and pick up the tongue to evaluate the balance      and the hitch weight. Then, while you shake the trailer      from side to side to test it for spring strength and wheel      wobble (which could be a clue to bad bearings), it probably      won't do any harm to grimace a little.    </p>    <p>      In short, you should try to put the seller on the defensive      without being too obnoxious . . . a talent that's shared by      almost every trader worth his or her salt. When you've got      the owner almost to the point of apologizing for the      quality of the goods he or she is trying to fob off on you,      it's time to make your offer.    </p>    <p>      And just how much should that initial bid be? Well, I find      that a good rule of thumb is to visualize the trailer all      fixed up and ready to sell, estimate your asking price, and      then <em>deduct 75%</em> . If the owner looks thunderstruck      and threatens to run you off the place, up your offer to      50% of your estimated selling price. Generally, if this      tactic isn't successful, you'll be better off looking      somewhere else. Of course, there are exceptions. When you      run across a real find - a goods hauler that's slick      and clean and pretty nearly ready to sell as is - you      can settle for a smaller profit margin because you'll have      to invest less time and material than usual in readying the      trailer for sale.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RECONDITIONING YOUR WARES</strong>    </p>        <p>      I never (well, maybe once in a while, as a last resort) buy      anything <em>new</em> to use in remodeling a secondhand      hauler: After all, that'd cut into my profit. Instead, I      improvise. For instance, despite the present state of the      economy, there seems to be a construction boom in our area,      so I haunt building sites and scrounge lumber from their      trash piles. I also make regular checks of the local dump      to look for salvageable materials there. [EDITOR'S NOTE: In      many places it's against the law to take anything from a      public dump. Check your local ordinances before trying to      do so. It's also a good idea to ask before hauling anything      away from a construction site, regardless of how      "discarded" the material may appear to be.]    </p>    <p>      I dearly love to attend garage sales and auctions, and      they're prime places to stock up on reconditioning goods. I      shop for hubcaps, wheel covers, taillights, wood, tires,      rims, and paint . . . while always keeping one eye open for      likely trailers.    </p>    <p>      When it comes to maintaining a good supply of tires,      though, my best source is the owner of a local gasoline      station. Whenever he gets a decent 15" or 16" trade-in, he      puts it aside for me . . . and I pay him $2.00 to $5.00      apiece. The used rubber replaces the threadbare or      completely treadless tires that are generally to be found      on the vehicles I buy to recondition.    </p>    <p>      Once a to-be-refurbished trailer is in your shop, the      creative part of this business can begin. Always work with      the buyer in mind . . . letting your own critical eye      function as the customer's representative. Hauling capacity      and mechanical condition are important, but I find that      "eyewash" - or appearance - is the factor that      sells two-wheelers to most people. If your for-sale cargo      hauler <em>looks</em> good, the money is halfway into your      pocket. So keep asking yourself that all-important      question, "If I were shopping for a trailer, would I buy      this one?"    </p>    <p>      Start the spruce-up job with a general cleaning . . . to      remove old paint, grease, dirt, and trash. (I've found that      a small air compressor with a hose and nozzle is a great      labor-saver, since it allows me to blow-clean the vehicle      before washing it.)    </p>    <p>      Next, make any wood or metal repairs that are necessary,      then patch the floors and fix any deep flaws with a      commercial filler such as Durham's Rock Hard Water Putty.      (This product can be purchased at most lumberyards and      hardware stores. It's easy to work with, and as tough as      bullhide when it dries . . . but it <em>won't</em> flex, so      don't use it on areas that will have a lot of play.) If      you're handy at sheet metal work, you can now hammer out,      fill in, and otherwise fix up any damaged metal body parts.    </p>    <p>      Then comes the painting . . . which is perhaps the single      most important part of your effort. I coat the wheels,      hitches, tongue, and undercarriage with the least expensive      spray enamel I can find . . . but I always dress up the      body - whether it's wood or metal - with      exterior latex house paint. Two brushed-on coats of latex      covering will have most trailers looking sharp, and I make      it a point to paint the trim a second color . . . because      doing so adds eye appeal and increases the cart's value to      most customers. If the floor of the two-wheeler is beat up      or badly stained, I cover it with a dark shade, usually      brown or flat black.    </p>    <p>      After painting, I tackle the finishing touches that take      little time or money but dramatically boost a trailer's      appeal. Tail-lights (don't wire them up, because you don't      know what kind of wiring rig the buyer will have), chrome      wheel covers or hubcaps, and reflector lights on the      tailgate may enable you to tack an extra $10 to $25 onto      your selling price . . . and will do so at minimal cost if      you've had success as a salvager.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAKING THE SALE</strong>    </p>    <p>      It often pays to advertise, but I try to keep my publicity      costs to a minimum. In fact, I spread the word for free      whenever possible . . . by simply placing descriptive ads      on bulletin boards at the college and in laundromats, farm      and garden supply stores, and supermarkets . . . by using      the local radio station's "swap and shop" program . . . and      by putting my trailers on display at a busy corner service      station. Classified ads in local shopping guides and daily      newspapers can also provide good exposure for my      merchandise.    </p>    <p>      I don't usually have to wait very long to sell my finished      products, either . . . there seem to be plenty of people      around who can use a trailer, and seeing or reading about      one of my fixed-up cargo haulers is frequently enough to      make them pull out their wallets. In fact, the only thing I      really have to worry about, as I show each customer my      reconditioned wares, is trying to spot the particular brand      of trader's psychology that the buyer is using on      me!    </p>
