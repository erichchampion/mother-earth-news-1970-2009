        <p><em>Conventional publishing wisdom claims that it's a mistake to run poetry in a "consumer" magazine. Although that may often be true, we're convinced that MOTHER's readers are the kind of people who look for beauty in the practical and search out practicality in the beautiful. . . and who realize that good poetry can be useful as well as inspiring. In fact, the best of poems can help us recognize the wonderful-and often well-hidden-similarities that all humans share . . . and, by doing so, can make each of us feel a little bit less alone. The poetry included in this occasional feature-be it brand-new or previously published, written by a recognized poet or a first-timer-will be material that, in the eyes of MOTHER's editors, helps us see ourselves in the words of others. It's that quality, and the fact that the work presented here will reflect the range of subject areas usually presented in this magazine, that gave this feature its name.</em></p><h3>Intruder</h3><p>All winter<br />weather lived in the house<br />like a poor relative with<br />no other refuge.<br />Plastic on the windows sagged<br />or billowed in the wind like lungs.<br />Cold wedged in the corners<br />and complained of its short bed<br />or abused the simple food.<br />Dark supplied our speech.<br />Not even the hearth's constant fire<br />could warm the heavy step<br />of family obligation.<br />Snow came in at the creases.</p><p>With spring, we brought blossoms<br />with their fresh light into the house.<br />Plum flowers, limbs<br />of pear and forsythia<br />woke the unwanted guest,<br />drove him out with aroma.<br />We have folded the quilts<br />and opened the windows wide.<br />We have opened the door.<br />Any traveler that moves on the wind<br />now blows clean through,<br />moves the lace curtains<br />with a gentle wish<br />that summer be thicker than blood.</p><p>-R.T.
