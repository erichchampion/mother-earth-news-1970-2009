                    <p>      <em>Here's a beautiful, practical design to please the      neophyte knitter and the needlework veteran alike.</em>    </p>           <h5 id="byline">by Priscilla Homola and MOTHER'S staff</h5>   <p>      Many people learn the basic knitting stitch-called      the garter stitch-in school, or from friends or      relatives . . . but, once having mastered <em>that</em>      maneuver, never go on to further develop their skill.      Sometimes this happens for lack of a satisfying project,      one that's really good-looking as well as practical. Well,      if you can handle the basic knitting stitch and know how to      increase and decrease, I think you'll find that the      diagonal garter-stitch square is reason enough to get those      needles out of storage.    </p>    <p>      I was taught this easy, attractive design by my mother, who      learned it from friends . . . and right from the start I      was impressed by the speed with which it allows projects to      be made up. In an hour or so, my mother would have a      triangle six to eight inches across, on its way to becoming      an infant's afghan. The pattern looked delicate, even      elegant, yet it was astonishingly simple: [1] Cast on 2      stitches. [2] Row 1: Knit 2 stitches, increasing on the      <em>second</em> stitch to make a total of 3 stitches. [3]      Row 2 on: Repeat as for Row 1, but knit to the end of each      row. [4] When the afghan reaches half the desired size,      begin to decrease by knitting 2 stitches together on the      second stitch of each row. [5] Continue until there are no      more stitches, cast off, and tie in the ends.    </p>    <p>      As you work, you form a border with the first two stitches      of each row. This border can be made wider, if you prefer:      Simply make your increase and decrease stitches farther      into the row. I found that I could knit as many as seven      stitches into the row before increasing or decreasing, and      the border looked just great.    </p>    <p>      Because each half of the diagonal square is a mirror image      of the other, and because there's often quite a bit of      leeway possible in the final sizes of projects, it's easy      to figure the distribution of yarn so that you have no      leftovers to worry about: two skeins in, two skeins out, so      to speak. This knowledge can be useful if, for example, you      fall heir to several skeins of yarn and would like to make      a small afghan. Just knit and increase until you've used up      half your yarn; then knit and decrease until the square's      finished and you have no more yarn left.    </p>    <p>      Baby afghans, as you probably know, are popular birthday      and shower gifts. I made the one pictured here with two      four-ounce skeins of three-ply yarn and size 10 needles. My      favorite project-and the one that went the      quickest-was a warm poncho for my one-year-old      daughter. I made this garment in two evenings, and it      turned out so well that it has become a best-loved piece of      winter wear. With a double strand of four-ply yarn to      insure warmth, and size 13 needles, I knitted the first      half of the poncho using one other jackets to gauge the      proper length. At about the halfway point, I measured the      poncho directly on her. When it proved to be the correct      size, I bound off 15 stitches in the center of the next      row-the last increase row-to make a neck      opening. In the following row, which was the first decrease      row, I simply cast those 15 stitches on again.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: To cast on stitches in the middle of a      row, just throw a series of half-hitch loops onto the right      needle. Since these tend to be rather loose along the      bottom, MOTHER'S staffer made our test poncho-shown      here-with a crocheted edge on the neck opening, which      firmed it up nicely. Our poncho, incidentally, took seven      ounces of four-ply pink yarn plus a bit of white for the      borders.]</em>    </p>    <p>      There are various ways to finish off the completed diagonal      square. You can leave it just as it is, tie fringe all      around the edges, crochet a border, or even sew on an      edging. Any one of these looks good.    </p>    <p>      Much depends on the particular yarn and the size needles      you use, but in general, the diagonal garter-stitch square      is a stretchy pattern that lends itself well to soft,      cuddly wraparounds, lap robes, carriage blankets, ponchos,      and afghans. I've also made dishcloths, using one-strand      cotton yarn, and pot holders, using two-strand cotton yarn.    </p>    <p>      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Remember to make pot holders extra      thick, or of two squares with a good filling in between, as      the knitted fabric can iet heat through! By the way, we      found that half a diagonal square makes a lovely triangular      shawl. Ours-shown in one of the accompanying      photos-took a little over nine ounces of exquisitely      soft Phentex Chunky yarn, and was given a border of single      and double crochet with a shell-stitched outer edge. We      used size 13 knitting needles and a size J crochet hook.      Still another suggestion is to use the triangle pattern for      diaper-style baby soakers-see MOTHER NO. 41, page 71,      for a description-made of wool, if possible, and held      on with a large safety pin or sewn-on fasteners.]</em>    </p>    <p>      There are, of course, special rewards to be found in      tackling <em>challenging</em> knitted patterns, but as      these photographs should show you, it's possible to make      something truly attractive and useful with this quick, easy      design.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Instructions on basic knitting      techniques, including increasing and decreasing, can be      found in issue 85, page 41, and issue 89, page 54.</em>    </p>
