                        <h3>      Part I    </h3>    <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us-for      instance-have read Paul's book The Population Bomb),      few people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (the type that tends to be      published only in technical journals and college texts).      That's why we're pleased to present this regular      semitechnical column by these well-known      authors/ecologists/educators.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne and Paul Ehrlich    </h5>    <p>      An ecological system-or <em>ecosystem</em>      -consists of all of the plants, animals, and      microorganisms in a given area together with the      interactions of those organisms with their physical      environments and with each other. Rather than introduce you      to ecosystems through a general description of their      properties, we'd like to describe a real one that we think      is fascinating. It has been studied quite thoroughly and is      probably familiar to you from nature films: the Serengeti      ecosystem of northern Tanzania and southern Kenya in East      Africa.    </p>    <p>      That system is more or less self-contained on a plateau      encompassing some 10,000 square miles, which is about the      size of Maryland. It's bounded on the east by hills and      volcanic mountains (which include the famous Ngorongoro      Crater), on the south and southwest by rocky woodlands and      cultivated areas, on the west by Lake Victoria, and on the      northwest and north by cultivated land and an escarpment.      The plateau lies just south of the equator, reaches an      elevation of almost 6,000 feet in the east, and slopes      downward to about 4,000 feet at Lake Victoria's shore. Low      hills dotted with sparse Acacia woodland typify the western      region, and from there stretches eastward a vast expanse of      broad, grassy plains.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the ecosystem is best described not      geographically but as an area strongly influenced by      enormous migratory herds of one species of antelope: the      wildebeest, or white-bearded gnu. It's also characterized      by the presence of the last great assemblage of wild      ungulate (hoofed mammal) species anywhere on this planet.    </p>    <h3>      The Intertropical Convergence Zone    </h3>    <p>      As with other ecosystems, the broad constraints within      which the Serengeti system functions are set by its      physical environment. In this equatorial setting, the major      limiting factor on plant growth is not temperature but      moisture, which is provided by an uneven and seasonal      rainfall. The rain, in turn, is controlled by movements of      a meteorological phenomenon called the Intertropical      Convergence Zone, a semipermanent high-pressure belt around      which converge the northeast trade winds from the Northern      Hemisphere and the southeast trade winds from the Southern      Hemisphere. The zone travels seasonally back and forth      across the equator.    </p>    <p>      When it moves south, the convergence zone brings to the      Serengeti relatively dry winds from the northeast and a      small amount of rain-the "short rains"-starting      around November. These rains, which end the dry season,      sometimes last only until January and sometimes continue      into March. Then the northward movement of the zone brings      moisture-laden winds from the southeast. These, originating      over the Indian Ocean, produce heavier rains-the      "long rains"- from March to May. July through October      is the dry season: The grass produced during the wet one      can no longer grow.    </p>    <p>      Physical variations on a smaller scale, such as the      different water-holding capacities of various soils, also      come into play. The soils along the ridgetops can store      relatively little water, and nutrients leach out quickly,      washing downhill. The hillside soils are linked by a series      of intermediate steps that form a soil <em>catena</em>      leading down the slopes to nutrient-rich earth deposited by      flowing water in the valleys.    </p>    <p>      The term catena is also used to describe the broader soil      trends in the Serengeti. The plains were formed by airborne      deposits of volcanic material from eastern-range eruptions.      The fallout was coarsest in the plains near the base of the      volcanoes and formed porous, easily leached soils there.      Farther west in the plains and in the northwest, where the      finer materials were blown, a more closely packed soil that      holds water better was formed. So an animal can "move down      the catena" either by traveling from a ridgetop to a valley      or by migrating north and, west-in either case moving      toward increasingly moisture-retentive soils.    </p>    <h3>      Gnus on the Go    </h3>    <p>      Today, more than a million wildebeests graze the Serengeti,      moving from one area to another at various times of the      year in order to find the highest-quality forage. During      the dry season, they are concentrated in thorn woodland in      the relatively moist north-western section, which is      infested in the wet season with mosquitoes and tsetse      flies. Within that area, the animals may travel as much as      50 miles a day if food and water are widely separated, as      they will not go more than five days without drinking      water.    </p>    <p>      At the beginning of the wet season, the wildebeests move      toward thunderstorms (which they can detect from 15 miles      away by sound and 60 miles away by sight of the      anvil-topped storm clouds) to take advantage of the grass      that sprouts after the rains. The animals soon move      eastward into the plains, and from January to May they      travel in a generally clockwise direction through the      central and eastern plains of the Serengeti. At the end of      the wet season, as the grass on the plains dries up, the      wildebeests return to the moist northwest.    </p>    <p>      In their migrations, the wildebeests ordinarily are      accompanied by zebras and Thomson's gazelles. These three      species, however, do not all follow precisely the same      routes and timetables, and they do not use exactly the same      food plants. During the wet season, the animals are all      concentrated on the upper (southeastern) catena of the      plains, feasting on freshly sprouted grasses that have a      high protein content. When the wet season draws to a close,      the zebras are the first to move off down the catena. By      preference, they eat the relatively tough, protein-poor      flower stems of the drying grasses. (Grazing animals make      little use of the protein-rich seeds on the stems.)    </p>    <p>      After the zebras come the wildebeests, which feed primarily      on leaves and the sheaths at the bases of      leaver-plant parts that contain more protein than the      stems, and that are made more accessible by the zebras'      removal of the taller stems. Then it's the turn of the      Thomson's gazelles to occupy the now-short sward.    </p>    <p>      The "Tommies" feed heavily on protein-rich forbs (non-grass      herbs)-which the previous grazers have      exposed-in addition to the grass sheaths and leaves.      Their slender muzzles allow them to feed much more      selectively than either the zebras or wildebeests. Tommies      avoid areas of tall grass, perhaps because their small size      (they're around 26 inches high at the shoulder-about      half the height of wildebeests and zebras) makes it hard      for them to spot predators.    </p>    <p>      Thus, each migrant changes the structure of the Serengeti      vegetation in ways that benefit those that follow.    </p>    <p>      The total impact of the community of herbivores on the      Serengeti grassland has been a subject of intensive      research. Studies using fenced areas to exclude the large      herbivores have shown that grazing increases the diversity      of grasses while reducing the average height of the      foliage. Grazing also causes individual plants to produce      more shoots than roots, thus raising aboveground      productivity.    </p>    <p>      In addition, the pressure of the herbivores affects the      competitive relationships among the Serengeti's various      plants. For example, grasses are generally more resistant      to grazing than forbs are. The permanently embryonic tissue      responsible in herbs for the growth of shoots is at the      ends of the shoots, where they are vulnerable to removal by      grazers. But grasses have those tissues just above each      node of the stem, where they are much less likely to be      eaten and are protected and supported by sheaths at the      bases of the leaves. The blade of the leaf also has an      embryonic area at its base so that, unlike the leaves of      forbs, it can continue to grow if the end of the leaf is      eaten. Furthermore, branching in grasses occurs primarily      at ground level, and the resulting rosette is often      extended and reproduced by stems growing horizontally      underground or spreading along the surface of the ground.    </p>    <p>      If the grass plant is smashed flat, differential growth of      the embryonic tissue occurs and once again aims the shoot      upward. This, in combination with the ability of the chewed      leaves to continue to elongate and spread by horizontal      stems, makes grasses extremely resistant to trampling and      grazing by ungulates. The presence of these animals in      large numbers actually favors the continued dominance of      grasses and the perpetuation of grasslands.    </p>    <p>      In fact, plant populations exposed to grazing on the      Serengeti have proved to be genetically different from      those permanently protected in fenced-in areas. The grazed      plants are somewhat dwarfed and grow more closely to the      ground as a result of the selection pressures applied by      the grazers. Indeed, the Serengeti system appears to be one      of the few remaining great reservoirs of grazing-resistant      plant genotypes-a "genetic library" of potentially      incalculable value to humanity.    </p>    <p>      <em>For more information, see A.R.E.
