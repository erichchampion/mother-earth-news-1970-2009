                    <h2 id="subtitle">The Wonderful<br />      WOOD-BURNING COOKSTOVE    </h2>        <p>      While rummaging through MOTHER'S 13,000-volume in-house      research library not long ago, we uncovered (literally) an      age-yellowed little slip of a book called <em>The Secret of      Better Baking</em> . The period cover art showed a smiling      homemaker with bobbed hair, a bowl of bread dough in one      hand and a copy of <em>The Secret of Better Baking</em> in      the other. Turning to the title page, we read that the book      was "By Mary D. Chambers, B.S., A.M., Associate Editor of      <em>American Cookery</em> , Author of <em>Principles of      Food Preparation, One-Piece Dinners</em> , Etc., Etc., Etc.      Copyright, 1925, Portland Stove Foundry Co., Portland,      Maine."    </p>    <p>      This 59-year-old handbook turned out to be the most      concise, entertaining source of wood cookstove      selection/use/care/cooking knowledge we've seen-so,      naturally, we decided to share parts of it with you. We      think you'll agree with us that <em>The Secret of Better      Baking</em> does reveal some valuable secrets of operating      those somewhat finicky cooker-heaters and proves that some      of the better things in life-such as the joys of      preparing a delicious meal on a wood-burning      cookstove-never change.    </p>    <h3>      Mary D. Chambers    </h3>        <p>      In one of the comedies of a generation ago, there is a love      scene in which the hero picks up a leathery-looking object      and makes a show of trying to bend it over his knee.    </p>    <p>      "What is it?" he asks.    </p>    <p>      The maid hangs her head in embarrassment, but replies      courageously, "It's a pie. I made it."    </p>    <p>      "I'll eat it!" exclaims the delighted lover.    </p>    <p>      But the lady, with an eye to the future, recovers the pie      and persuades the youth to prove his valor in less      hazardous ways.    </p>    <p>      Baking a crisp, juicy pie or a deftly browned loaf of      bread, or managing a Thanksgiving dinner is a worthwhile      accomplishment. The kitchen range is close to the center of      the home. It provides not only the main sustenance of life,      but also needed warmth for winter's cold and plentiful hot      water to encourage the highly regarded virtue of      cleanliness.    </p>    <p>      Hundreds of cookbooks and collections of recipes by famous      chefs witness the desire for variety in palatable and      wholesome dishes. The implements of cooking have made      equally rapid strides until they approach perfection. But a      recipe book and the finest-equipped kitchen in the world do      not make a cook. A good cook has learned how to handle her      range so that it does her bidding without effort or "off      days." And the cookbooks do not tell her. There seems to be      very little help for those who are making their first      acquaintance with a modern range. This booklet is an      introduction to your stove-just a few hints to make      the acquaintance ripen more rapidly and to help you to a      fuller enjoyment of the hours spent in the kitchen.    </p>    <h3>      Building the Fire    </h3>    <p>      No other article in the home means so much to the entire      family as the kitchen range. Health and comfort are      dependent upon it. No wonder a good housekeeper takes pride      in the contentment of her family over the good things for      the table that she provides: the extra heat in cold      weather, the abundance of hot water on tap all the time,      and many other things for which the modern range is      equipped.    </p>    <p>      A good modern range is designed to get the greatest cooking      and heating value out of the fuel used. When the range and      chimney draft are right, a properly controlled fire will do      all the work required, without wasting fuel.    </p>    <p>      It is therefore necessary to bear in mind that the first      problem of better baking is an understanding of the fire.      If a match is lighted, the flame shoots upward. The hot      blaze causes a draft, drawing fresh air from below and      supplying the oxygen necessary for combustion. The range      simply makes use of this basic principle on a large scale.    </p>    <p>      To start the fire, then, have on hand plenty of      free-burning fuel-dry paper and wood-cut small. A      folded newspaper will not burn freely, but a few sheets,      lightly twisted, make a good first layer. Then add a      moderate supply of kindling wood, laid in loosely.    </p>    <p>      Before lighting, open the door or vent <em>under the      fire</em> , the direct draft to the chimney (over the      oven), the check slide at the base of the smoke pipe, and      the damper in the smoke pipe. The purpose is to promote a      free passage of air up through the firebox to the chimney      by the most direct route.    </p>    <p>      Remember that no stove has a draft of itself. The draft is      furnished by the chimney through the stovepipe, which      obviously must be tight in all its joints.    </p>    <p>      Light the fire from below and allow it to get a good start.      If it burns too slowly, it needs more oxygen, which can be      supplied by opening the door wide under the fire. If it      burns too fast, it will produce more smoke than the chimney      can draw off, and the excess will be thrown out into the      room. Partly closing the door under the fire will retard      it. (The first fire in a new range usually causes a little      surface smoke and oily odor. This is harmless and soon      passes off.)    </p>    <p>      Before applying larger pieces of wood or coal, add a little      more kindling. The grate should be well-covered with a      brisk fire, both to support and ignite the larger fuel      evenly and to prevent waste through the grate.    </p>    <p>      Never use kerosene to quicken a slow fire.    </p>    <p>      When the bigger fire has a good start, the oven damper may      be closed.    </p>    <p>      The process of keeping up a good fire is merely one of      adding more fuel, and occasionally "shaking down" to remove      the ashes under the fire.    </p>    <p>      Do not allow ashes to collect close up under the grate.      They will kill the fire and cause the hot coals above to      burn out the grate. In fact, this is about the only way a      grate is damaged in ordinary use.    </p>    <p>      Some housekeepers who depend upon the kitchen range for      heating adjoining rooms or for continuous hot water      maintain the same fire for months at a time. When not in      use for cooking, the oven door may be left open to help      heat the adjoining rooms.    </p>    <h3>      Checking the Fire    </h3>        <p>      If the draft of air through the firebox continues      unchecked, the fuel soon burns out, and the top of the      range gets red-hot-a bad thing for the stove.      Frequent overheating causes warping and expanding and      sometimes cracking of the cover. The fire needs to be      curbed. This may be accomplished in various ways: by      closing tight the door and slide under the fire, by      partially closing the damper in the stovepipe or pushing in      the slide near the stovepipe collar on top of the range, by      opening the slide in the broiler door at the end of the      range <em>over the fire</em> , or by tipping the lids or      covers over the fire. The chimney keeps pulling for air,      and the fire is checked by reducing the amount of chimney      suction or by allowing the air to rush in <em>over the      fire</em> , instead of through it. Closing the damper over      the oven also checks the fire, but the real purpose of this      damper is to send the heat around the oven on its way to      the chimney.    </p>    <h3>      Advantage of a Large Firebox    </h3>    <p>      The range should have a firebox large enough to keep a fire      overnight. Under proper damper control, it will smolder all      night and have sufficient life to rekindle quickly in the      morning. Then too, it requires far more fuel to start new      fires frequently than to keep an old fire. If it is found      that the fire does not keep overnight, the trouble is due      to one of two things: Either the draft is too strong,      causing the fire to burn out, or too weak, causing the fire      to die for lack of air.    </p>    <p>      No directions can be given in advance to cover every case,      because chimney drafts vary so much, but there is a happy      medium that can be determined by a little experimenting.    </p>    <p>      Generally speaking, the slide in the broiler door should be      open at night, and the slide under the smoke collar should      be pushed to the left to some extent.    </p>    <p>      In any case, it is essential in the morning to get rid of      quite a large body of ashes which has accumulated in the      firebox. At least half, and perhaps two-thirds, of the      contents of the firebox usually consists of ashes and      coals, which give no heat and must be removed every morning      to reestablish a good fire for baking. A half revolution of      the dock-ash grate will usually do this very nicely, and in      fact this grate is designed for this particular purpose. If      a stove is equipped with a plain grate, considerable      shaking is necessary. The triangular grate may be handled      similarly to the dock-ash grate, turning one-third or      two-thirds or sometimes even a full revolution.    </p>    <p>      The ashes should be removed from the ashpit or -pan, both      to improve the draft and to prevent injury to the grate.    </p>    <p>      It would be difficult to overemphasize the trouble that can      be avoided by a regular and systematic cleaning out of      ashes and dying embers under the fire. A fire may look      bright on top and yet be almost out. Its body of clinkers      and ashes has little heating value, and unless there are      enough live coals on top to rekindle easily, it is better      judgment to dump the fire and start anew.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, a deep fire will do more work than a shallow      fire. Once well built-up, a deep fire can be maintained      more easily and with less fuel than a fire that half fills      the firebox. However, the box should not be filled above      the top of the bricks, as there is danger of overheating      and warping the lids.    </p>    <h3>      Using the Range    </h3>    <p>      The first question that enters the mind in regard to any      range is "How well does it bake?" For that reason, this      book is called <em>The Secret of Better Baking.</em>    </p>    <p>      But the range does many equally important things ... all at      the same time. Broiling may be going on at the firebox end,      boiling or frying in the center, simmering along the      outskirts, baking in the oven, keeping dishes hot in the      warming oven, heating adjoining rooms, and supplying a      tankful of hot water. So long as there is a fire going, it      should be cooking something or keeping cooked food warm.      The old-fashioned siockpot is an example. It remained on      top of the stove all the time, taking anything that would      contribute to wholesome soups and stews. The stockpot can      be used to advantage where canned soups are not easily      obtained. Hot breakfast cereal, cooked the night before,      will be improved if kept warm on the back of the stove.    </p>    <h3>      Cooking on Top of the Stove    </h3>    <p>      Fill the teakettle before lighting the fire to get all the      advantage of the first flames. When a new fire is built,      the strong, direct draft up the chimney tends to draw the      hot flames close under the center of the stove. Over a      fresh wood fire the breakfast coffee sometimes boils      quicker in the center of the stove than on the less-heated      lids directly over the firebox. Perhaps the dish of water      for the four-minute egg refuses to come to a boil. Why?      Because the cook has not learned that water will boil      quicker if a cover is put on the dish. A cover on the      spider has the same effect and also keeps the stove      cleaner. A little later, when the fire is going well, the      whole top of the range is hot enough for boiling liquids in      large kettles or heating the flats for ironing when      electric ironing is not practicable.    </p>    <p>      Broiling should be prepared for in advance. The fire should      be built up high and show an even surface of clear, red-hot      coals. Good broiling requires intense heat for a short      time, over coals that are past the flaming and      gas-producing stage.    </p>    <p>      Open the oven damper so the smoke will go directly up the      chimney. Also give the fire some draft underneath. Take off      the two lids over the fire and sear over your sirloin,      chop, or fish as quickly as possible, with frequent      turning. This quick searing of the surface tends to prevent      the escape of the juices and rewards the cook with a      toothsome article of food impossible to produce in any      other way. (A little olive oil on the steak before or after      broiling gives a wonderful flavor.)    </p>    <p>      A coal or charcoal fire is the selection of the world's      finest chefs for broiling.    </p>    <p>      Anything broiled should be served as soon as it comes off      the fire. If that is impracticable, put it on a platter and      keep it hot in the oven.    </p>    <h3>      Use of the Oven    </h3>        <p>      The real test of the range is in the baking. Nothing but      individual experience is a safe guide in handling any      particular range, but the general principle is the same.    </p>    <p>      When the fire is first started, the flames rush over the      top of the oven and thence directly to the chimney. This      heats the top of the oven, while the bottom remains      comparatively cool. The entire oven must be healed and the      body of fire must be sufficient to maintain an even heat      for a considerable length of time. The oven becomes evenly      heated by closing the oven damper, forcing the flames and      smoke down one side and under the oven, entirely around and      up again to reach the chimney.    </p>    <p>      Foods prepared for baking or roasting differ widely in the      time and temperature required for cooking. A little      practice will determine the correct temperature and best      location in the oven for different bakes.    </p>    <p>      In a wood or coal range, baking is done directly on the      bottom of the oven or on the raised rack. Never attempt to      bake with the rack placed on the bottom of the oven.    </p>    <h3>      Use of the Warming Oven    </h3>        <p>      Plates may be kept warm in the warming oven, but this is      not all that may be done in it. Dried fruit, such as      prunes, figs, and raisins, may be put to soak in water in      the warming oven and left there for hours and hours,      developing a richness and sweetness that cannot be      otherwise produced.    </p>    <p>      One of the attributes of a good cook is a knack for serving      <em>hot</em> dishes hot. This is not always easy when there      is considerable variety in the menu. Here is where the      warming oven may play an important part and cause the      guests to wonder "how she does it."    </p>    <p>      For example, take a thick sirloin: If properly timed, it      may be broiled just short of completion. Then, while the      accompanying dishes are made ready to serve, put the steak      on a platter, with plenty of butter, and place it in the      warming oven. The heat contained in the meat combined with      the heat contributed by the warming oven completes the      cooking, and your steak is done to a turn, juicy and      delicious, on a platter that will keep it hot. This is one      of the secrets of the expert broiler of steaks.    </p>    <p>      Puddings, such as creamy rice pudding, Indian pudding,      apple tapioca, steamed fruit pudding, and others, may be      much improved by placing in the warming oven for an hour      after baking or steaming.    </p>    <p>      Stale bread may be dried out in the warming oven for      rolling and sifting, and if pulled bread and croutons for      soups are put into the warming oven, they will cook of      their own accord, without being looked after.    </p>    <p>      Jelly that has not jelled will sometimes jell after a day      or half a day in the warming oven, and even fruit that is      only half-ripe will ripen after a time in this convenient      place, if a dish of water is set beside the fruit to keep      it from drying out.    </p>    <h3>      Use of the Baking Oven    </h3>    <p>      We all know the New England boiled dinner. Not everyone      knows the "Atlantic" baked dinner. About an hour and a half      before dinnertime, put into the oven, heated as for bread      baking, a four-to five-pound chicken or a cut from a leg of      veal or lamb, and a dish of scalloped potatoes. Keep the      temperature even. Three-quarters of an hour later, add      three large carrots, scraped and cut in halves lengthwise,      placing them on the rack of the pan that holds the meat. In      another fifteen minutes, put in six tomatoes, in an earthen      baking dish. By the time the tomatoes are      done-fifteen or twenty minutes-a baked dinner      for six persons will be ready to serve. After removing the      meat and vegetables from the oven, if you place in it six      fruit patties, or six cup-custards in a pan with an inch or      more of water, these will be ready to serve for dessert.    </p>    <p>      Popovers, cream puffs and éclairs, angel cake and      sponge cakes are easier to bake successfully if put into a      cool oven and the temperature gradually increased.    </p>    <p>      Flour mixtures that are of a special shape which should be      preserved, like the fancy braided loaves and Parker House      rolls, ought to go into a very hot oven so that a crust      will immediately form to preserve the shape, and then the      baking may proceed at a low temperature.    </p>    <p>      All meats, fish, and poultry are also better cooked at a      high temperature to begin with to hold in the      juices-then a gradual reduction of heat. Baste      frequently.    </p>    <p>      Bread, cakes, pies, and vegetables may be baked at uniform      temperature, or with a slight gradual increase or decrease.    </p>    <p>      In many cases, cooking started at a low temperature,      gradually increasing, will develop a different taste from      the same food started at high heat. Boiled custards, if      made with cold milk, are more delicate than if the milk is      added very hot.    </p>    <p>      Scrambled eggs or omelets cooked on a fiercely hot pan from      the start take on a richer flavor than when started on a      rather cool pan. It is necessary to work fast, however, as      overcooking on a very hot pan produces a result that      resembles rubber in texture.    </p>    <p>      Those who enjoy a really good cup of coffee will agree that      there is a surprising difference in taste. A cup of real      coffee has much more to it than hot water and dark brown      color. It should be good if you start with a good blend      (ground at home just before using) and are not too      economical of the quantity used. For some reason, coffee      made in one-cup portions lacks the character of the larger      brew. Adding the shells of fresh eggs or a raw egg beaten      up with the coffee before boiling both enriches the flavor      and produces a much clearer beverage.    </p>    <p>      Coffee tastes quite different when started with cold or hot      water. It is the general opinion that a better result is      obtained by mixing with a little cold water and bringing to      a boil-then adding boiling water and setting back a      few minutes to settle.    </p>    <p>      Cereals take on a different flavor, depending on whether      they are started in cold or hot water. Which is the      <em>better</em> flavor is a matter of taste.    </p>    <p>      All good cooks know the most important secret of all: While      the bake is on, make a job of it.    </p>    <p>      No two conditions of range and draft are exactly      alike-in fact, they will differ in your own home,      depending on the weather or the direction of the wind. A      set of exact rules for one situation would not fit another.      In any case, there must be a good body of fire to hold the      oven at a cooking temperature. The articles that are being      baked or roasted may do better on the rack than on the      bottom of the oven, or vice versa.    </p>    <p>      But no definite rules made for one situation would be at      all valuable when compared with the stored-up knowledge      gained from your own <em>experience</em> -remembering      how the oven acted before under similar conditions, and      making it serve you better and better with every day's      acquaintance.    </p>    <p>      The foregoing hints are confined very largely to the      mechanical operation and care of the range. So much depends      upon the preparation of foods for cooking that the      temptation to add several pages of palatable recipes is      very strong. Recipes are easily obtained, however, and the      real purpose of this booklet is to suggest ways of getting      consistently better results with the range and draft as      they are. If the range works well all the time, both the      stove and the draft are all right. If the range has off      days, the chimney draft needs attention. A cleaning out may      help, or perhaps an extension of the chimney to a point      where the air currents will improve the draft.    </p>    <p>      If you are getting good results only part of the time, you      should get much <em>better</em> results the rest of the      time by making a study of the conditions of fire and draft      when the stove is at its best.    </p>    <p>      If the range fails to give satisfaction the greater part of      the time, look for serious defects in the range itself or      in the conditions of its installation or operation. If it      is cracked or broken, it is past its usefulness. Its      operation becomes rapidly more wasteful and irritating, and      the early installation of a new range will be good economy      and good sense.    </p>    <p>      The kitchen range usually does its work so well that its      virtues are taken for granted. When it breaks down from old      age, the whole family realizes what an advance has been      made since the days of kettles hung in fireplaces and cuts      of meat slowly roasted on wooden spits.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Although the Portland Stove      Foundry-the company that originally published</em>      The Secrets of Better Baking <em>-is no longer in      business, its descendant, the Portland Stove Company,      restores and sells the classic Atlantic cookstoves.
