                            <h3>      What's New for '85    </h3>    <p>      Now, as wild winter winds rattle windowpanes, it's time to      retreat to the garden of your mind. Pull out the pile of      glossy catalogs and lose yourself for hours on end in their      lush summertime of pictures and words.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Peter Hemingson    </h5>    <p>      The cornucopia I call my mailbox is overflowing-as      usual-with catalogs from seed houses large and small.      In this issue, I'll only be able to review some of the new      offerings . . . but the rest will appear in the next issue      of MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Among the introductions from Agway, the big northeastern      cooperative that sells mainly through its local stores, are      the high-yielding Bounty bush bean, an early (50-day)      variety with 6-inch pods that are slow to develop seeds . .      . Prominence broccoli, a strong-growing 75-day cultivar      that produces heavily . . . White Summer cauliflower, a      good fall cropper with self-wrapping characteristics and      excellent color and texture . . . Gold Dust corn, an early      (72-day) yellow with good cold tolerance and vigor . . .      and Fiesta Hybrid ornamental corn, which bears multicolored      7- to 10-inch ears that mature in a brief (for an      ornamental) 102 days on short, sturdy stalks. Other Agway      offerings include the very early (53-day) Red Ace beet, a      hybrid with extremely high sugar content and welcome bolt      and heat resistance, as well as tolerance of Cercospera      leaf spot disease . . . Chinook II, a 42-day hybrid      semi-savoyed spinach that combines the best of both worlds:      It overwinters well and is slow to bolt in hot weather . .      . and Castlette, a determinate hybrid cherry tomato that      bears abundant crops 75 days after being set out and is      resistant to verticillium and Race 1 (a prevalent type) of      fusarium.    </p>    <p>      The folks at Spring River Nurseries (Dept. N, Spring River      Rd., Hartford, MI 49057) have called my attention to a new      "day neutral" strawberry, Brighton, that's capable of      fruiting year-round! The result of research at the      University of California and the USDA's facilities in      Maryland, Brighton was developed from a plant that was      found growing in the mountains of Utah. Unlike standard and      everbearing varieties-both of which fruit in response      to specific patterns of daylight-this cultivar's      fruiting mechanism is unaffected by day length. In fact, if      you take some plants in to a sunny window in the fall, you      can have fresh berries for the holidays! The only thing      that stops Brighton from bearing is temperatures over      100°F. (I must admit that I slow up under such      conditions, too.) Since Brighton forms many runners that      are capable of fruiting without being anchored in the soil,      the plant makes a perfect indoor pot specimen. Send $1.00      to Spring River for two sample plants plus free      information.    </p>    <p>      Park Seeds (Greenwood, SC 29647; free catalog) has a number      of new offerings, including Red Sails lettuce, an      All-America selection for 1985. An open-head variety, the      red-leaf lettuce matures in 45 days and is more resistant      to bolting than most "greens" of similar color. With its      habit and hue, Red Sails would make a wonderful border      plant for the garden . . . interspersed, perhaps, with      another winner from Park: Spicy Globe basil. Its small      leaves combine the goodness of basil with a touch of the      tingle of cinnamon, while the plant's form is naturally      ball-shaped. Other goodies from Park include the Sugar      Daddy pea, the latest miracle from Dr. Calvin Lamborn's      breeding program. Resistant to powdery mildew, Sugar Daddy      also does away with what many felt was the single flaw of      the Sugar Snap pea: the string. This short (30-inch vines)      and early (72-day) snap pea is a genuine "gobble 'em in the      garden" delight. And for those fond of peas and carrots,      Park offers Lindoro, an early-but      large-Nantes-type root with a bright orange color,      crisp texture, and a fine sweet flavor. And though it's too      early by several months to plant it, Sweet Winter onion can      make a wonderful menu addition for 1986. You see, these      hardy globes are started in late summer and carry over      winters as cold as -20°F with perfect aplomb. The      sweet-flavored "tearjerkers" provide an extra-early crop      and also resist bolting.    </p>    <p>      One of our favorite seed houses, Pine Tree Garden Seeds (RR      1, Box 397, New Gloucester, ME 04260; free catalog), has a      double treat for gardeners in 1985: the Jenny Lind melon      and a wax bean named Dragon Langerie. The melon, unlike its      namesake, is of surpassing ugliness, sporting a coiffure      much like that of a turbaned squash. It's not very big,      either: about 12 ounces, on average. But the flavor ... ah,      the flavor! Dick Meiners, Pine Tree's owner and a      state-of-Mainer who does not exaggerate, modestly asserts      that "several experts have indicated that it is the      sweetest melon they've ever tasted." I believe him. The      vines run 4 to 5 feet, and the yield is excellent.    </p>    <p>      The bean with the fancy French moniker is an unusual      looker, too: long, flat, yellow, and covered with purple      stripes. The stripes disappear in cooking, leaving you with      a pot of luscious-looking legumes. Dick says that the fifth      picking produces about as much as the first (ayuh!), and      claims that the bean is good fresh, cooked, shelled, or      dried.    </p>    <p>      Folks who live in areas where warm early-autumn nights keep      their Delicious apples from coloring up might want to check      out StarkSpur UltraRed Delicious, a new introduction from      Stark Bros. (Louisiana, MO 63353; free catalog). And      organic growers will be especially pleased with the      performance of Stark's new disease-resistant seedless      grape, Mars. The high-yielding vines bear fruit that is      akin to Venus and Reliance, characterized by a strong      Concord-like flavor . . . and it shrugs off just about all      major grape diseases.    </p>
