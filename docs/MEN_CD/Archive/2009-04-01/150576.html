        <p>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is taking steps to become more sustainable. Nine Service facilities have been named Federal Energy Saver Showcases, an award given to government agencies that utilize the most energy-efficient technologies. In Vermont, the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge’s visitor center is the first Service building to receive the national Energy Star label from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The center boasts improved water efficiency, reduced light pollution, and the use of recycled materials such as carpet, ceiling tiles and gypsum wallboard. While this facility illustrates the Service’s growing environmental commitment, these steps are just a few of many to come.</p>
