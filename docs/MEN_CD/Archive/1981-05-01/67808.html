                <p>      Instead of "springing" for expensive garden and woodworking      implements, use...    </p>        <p>      Nowadays, it seems that there's power equipment available      for every imaginable task . . . and for a few that are      difficult to imagine. But it's still a real pleasure to      stroll through the aisles of your local hardware store and      catch sight of an honest-to-goodness <em>manual</em> tool.      All too often, though, the price tags on the quality      implements are enough to discourage many do-it-yourselfers.    </p>    <p>      Well, having found that their equipment needs and budget      just don't seem to want to get together, MOTHER's shop      folks hunkered down and came up with four basic hand tools      that're not only simplicity itself to construct, but can be      assembled for next to nothing. And the homemade implements      will perform every bit as well as their dearer storebought      cousins.    </p>    <p>      Three of the utensils-the bark spud, the froe, and      the drawknife-are designed to be used when working      with wood. The fourth-a mattockis a      general-purpose tool for loosening soil, cutting      roots, and digging. All were fash ioned from common      junkpile scrap, and-with the exception of the draw      "shaver"-use either hand-hewn logs or "reborn" wooden      shafts for handles.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by BARK SPUD</h5>		     <p>      All it takes to make this timber skinner is a 1/4" piece of      4" X 8" steel plate, a 5" length of 1-1/4" Schedule 40      pipe, and an old shovel handle that's long enough to reach      from the ground to your chin. First, carefully grind one      end of the metal slab into a single-sided cutting edge with      an angle of about 15° from level. Then weld your pipe      collar to the rectangular blade so its forward end is about      4-1/2 inches behind the cleaving lip (be sure that the      ground surface is toward the bottom), and the tubular shank      itself meets the tool's head at an angle of about 5°.      (Some folks may prefer to modify this union by increasing      the angle to 20° and filling the space with triangular      metal gussets . . . thus making it easier to use the spud      to strip the uppermost surfacerather than the side-of      the log.)    </p>    <p>      With this done, merely fit the handle securely into its      receptacle (using a small wedge, if necessary), and have at      your to-be-stripped timber in "shuffleboard" fashion. By      scraping horizontally at the surface of the offending log,      you can have it peeled in jig time . . . and you'll find      that your new "chisel" will make short work of stubborn      knots, too!    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROE<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      A froe is used to split logs into billets, or to cleave      blocks into thin sections (as when making shingles). The      heart of this device is an old automobile leaf spring . . .      which provides not only the sturdy steel necessary to      guarantee a durable tool, but also the shank to which a      handle can be fastened. Select a spring with a width of      about 2-1/2", and torch it to a 16" overall length,      including the suspension unit's shackle mounting hole in      your measurement. Now grind both sides of one long edge to      form a double-faced cutting surface with a 15° angle      (in relation to the blade's flat "loins") on each side.    </p>    <p>      Next, fashion a handle out of a 17" length of available      hardwood (we used a dogwood limb . . . but oak, hickory, or      ash would be fine, too), making certain that its diameter      fits snugly within the spring's shackle "eye". Insert the      wood from the side opposite the ground edge and lock it in      place with a hardwood wedge.    </p>    <p>      To use the tool, hold its handle vertically and place the      cleaving edge against the end of your billet, then beat on      the blade's uppermost (or striking) surface with a froe      club (you can make one from a piece of hardwood). By      levering the cutting bar back and forth after each blow,      you can separate the wood sections while still maintaining      some control over the direction of cut.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DRAWKNIFE<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      This straightforward device operates like a plane, except      for the fact that its depth of cut is controlled by the      user. . . who simply changes the blade's "angle of attack"      to slice more or less wood away. To make the tool, we      removed a straight 12" section from the same piece of      spring stock used in the froe, and ground an even,      one-sided bevel-at an angle of 33°-along      one edge of the steel. Then we took two pieces of 3/8"      round bar, each about 7" long . . . bent them (over heat)      to form equal-armed 45° angles . . . and welded one of      the handles to each end of the blade, so that the grip:      were behind the cutting surface and leve I with the bar.      Finally, we put a sham edge on the knife with a whetstone,      making sure to maintain a straight bevel.    </p>    <p>      Put the tool to work by holding it a arm's length in front      of your chest-wit the bevel facing downward-and      pulling it toward you along the wood's surface.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MATTOCK<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Again, this digging implement is mad, from a section of car      spring . . . preferably an arced piece about 26" long. Cut;      one end to form a point, with 30° angles on each side,      and file 40° bevels on the opposite end to produce a      two-faced blade. Then torch a 1" X 1-1/2" ellipse into the      center of the arc, and weld a 3" piece of 1-1/4" pipe      (after forming it into an oval shape in a vise) directly      over this hole. Finally, from a suitable length of      hardwood, make a handle that measures 1-1/2" X 2" X 36",      fit it to the pipe collar, and lock it in place with a      steel or hardwood wedge.    </p>    <p>      You'll probably find-as we did-that it's      actually sort of fun to work with shop scrap and come up      with something useful . . . but the real "return" on the      time you invest will occur after you've actually put these      low-tech tools to the test . . . and discovered that      "homemade" can be better than store-bought!    </p>
