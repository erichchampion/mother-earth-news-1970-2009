            				<p>      A new-from-the ground-up sun-heated dwelling could be      yours... for as little as $29,000.    </p>              <p>      It's not too often that we here at MOTHER get a chance to      <em>compliment</em> our federal government. So, when such      an opportunity does arise, you can bet that we'll play it      fair and square and let folks know where some of their tax      dollars are being put to good use.    </p>    <p>      Now since this article deals with passive solar housing,      you might expect that our kudos will be directed toward an      <em>energy</em> -related branch of our republic's      management. But, unusual as it may seem, in this case the      credit has to go to the Farmers Home Administration, a      division of the United States Department of Agriculture.    </p>       <h3>MOM, A HOME, AND A PIECE OF THE      SOLAR PIE</h3>        <p>      The FmHA is, you see, the "credit" arm of the USDA . . . it      provides low-interest housing loans-to qualified      people-for the construction of some 110,000 homes and      apartments annually in rural locales. (Such areas, for      eligibility purposes, are defined as either open country or      towns with populations of less than 20,000.)    </p>    <p>      As a decentralized agency with 1,884 county offices      throughout the nation, the FmHA is able to relate-at      a grassroots 'level-to people who need to borrow      affordable money . . . not only for shelter, but also to      provide new employment, start businesses, or help purchase      or operate farms. However, far from being yet another big      government "giveaway" plan, the Farmers Home program relies      in almost totally on insured loans. . . which are made and      serviced by federal per sonnel, but use private capital      obtained through the sale of notes. The 100% mortgage funds      are available-at interest rates as low as one      percent-to families with annual adjusted incomes of      no more than $15,600 . . . and the difference between the      borrower's and lender's premium is the "tab" that comes out      of the federal till.    </p>    <p>      Making home ownership possible for those who can't      <em>afford</em> high-interest housing, the FmHA people      believe, will bolster the rural economy by encouraging      responsible people to settle and work in such areas.      Furthermore, the resulting construction can provide jobs      for local builders, contractors, and tradespeople . . .      work which might otherwise be difficult to find.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the FmHA isn't just a money-lending agency. It      has, in fact, a comprehensive program that embraces      everything from actual structure design to public relations      . . . and is involved in bringing its services to the      attention of businesspeople, planning groups, and local and      state officials, as well as to possible recipients.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, Farmers Home Administration architects were      concerned with structural soundness, practicality, ease of      construction, and low cost, but not necessarily with energy      conservation. Now, however, thanks to the efforts of some      progressive folks at the state level, simple passive solar      techniques are being incorporated into the agency's basic      home designs, without spoiling the integrity of the      structures . . . thus making sun-powered dwellings      available at prices that have already proved to be equal      to-or at most only 5% more than-those of sim      ilar-sized conventionally-heated homes!    </p>    <p>      The man behind this "solarization" is Robert Andron, one of      the FmHA architects assigned to the North Carolina area.      Several years ago, as head of his own design firm, Bob      worked up a number of plans in which solar energy played a      major role. (He actually started using the sun in his      layouts long before the notion was popular, and attributes      some of his concepts-and a lot of his      inspiration-to the pages of MOTHER!) So when he      signed on with the federal team, Bob saw no reason to put a      good idea to rest.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Andron knew, in short, that he could take a typical      two- or three-bedroom suburban tract house, and-using      low-tech solar hardware-turn the structure into a      practical sun-heated dwelling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE "VOLKSWAGEN"</strong> <strong>OF SOLAR      HOMES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The houses being financed under the FmHA "small home"      program range in size from about 900 square feet of heated      area to slightly over 1,000 . . . although such additions      as carports, outside storage areas, and porches can add to      the structures' overall size. To hold building costs down,      great care is taken to keep the plans as conventional as      possible, so as not to confuse contractors and suppliers      with unfamiliar techniques or materials (which they might      construe as "custom"-that is, <em>expensive</em>      -work).    </p>    <p>      As a result, the bottom line for these      homes-excluding such things as land and septic      system, and depending upon locale-ranges from $29,000      to about $35,000 for a contractor-built package . . . a      price which can be reduced sub stantially should the owner      choose to construct his or her own home. (Fortunately, the      FmHA program allows applicants a great deal of flexibility      in the design, construction, and decoration of their      abodes, and will even provide contacts and professional      consultation for any program participants who wish to      become intimately involved in the creation of their"      castles".)    </p>		    <p>      The structures themselves depend on three standard      techniques to achieve at least partial energy independence:    </p>    <p>      [1] They're oriented ten degrees east of due south . . . to      reduce insolation from the west on sultry summer afternoons      while still taking full advantage of the light and heat      available in the winter. Protective roof overhangs are also      included in the designs, to prevent the rays of the high      "dog days" sun from directly entering the homes.    </p>    <p>      [2] The insulation goes beyond the requirements of normal      state and local codes, to hold both artificial and natural      heat in the dwelling. The walls of the homes are equipped      to an equivalent of R-19, and the ceilings protected to an      R-30 level (the foundation walls or slabs also have rigid      styrofoam lining). Equally important, all the south-facing      windows are furnished with thermal curtains: framefitted      roll-up quilts that prevent heat collected during the day      from escaping out the windows at night.    </p>    <p>      [3] Each house is equipped with low, broad "Trombette"      walls . . . which are actually brick thermal storage masses      placed four inches behind large, doubleglazed windows or      sliding glass doors on the south side of the structure.      Unlike "conventional" Trombe walls (which, because of their      size, are often both imposing and light-restrictive), the      pintsize partitions do a more-than-adequate job of storing      daytime warmth-and releasing it for up to six hours      in the evening-while still allowing natural light to      enter above the walls . . . and can even function as      attractive planters or shelf units. By the same token, if      for any reason a resident chooses to shut out daylight, the      thermal shades can be partially drawn-to the level of      the brick bulkheads' upper surfaces-without      sacrificing the heat storage capabilities of the system.    </p>    <p>      Beyond those basics, care was taken to make the home      designs both flexible and attractive. For example, the      North Carolina plans provide for main entry from the north,      south, or east (to allow construction in virtually any      subdivision) . . . and material, trim, and color options      are left completely to the builder or buyer. The backup      thermal system is currently zone-controlled electric      baseboard heat, but those homeowners with adequate supplies      of timber can use woodstoves, too, if they wish. Extra      summertime cooling is taken care of by a ceiling-mounted      "whole house" attic fan that "sweeps" the structure from      the floor upward.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ASK THE MAN OR WOMAN WHO OWNS ONE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Because the first FmHA passive solar houses were completed      only last year, comprehensive performance figures are not      yet available on a statewide level. But, if the experience      of the owners is any indication of the success of the      design, it looks as if the Farmers Home folks have a real      winner. MOTHER's editors spoke with several one-year      residents of the solar dwellings and heard nothing but good      from every one of them.    </p>    <p>      As an example, Al Marek-a cabinetmaker in Milton,      North Carolina-and his family didn't use even two      cords of wood to heat their home during this past cold      season, and two other families in the city of Wilson enjoy      noticeably lower utility bills than do their neighbors in      allelectric conventional houses. In fact, calculations      based on the original plans indicate that a full two-thirds      of the structures' energy needs can be provided by the sun      . . . and some North Carolina owners report even greater      savings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANS ARE AVAILABLE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Folks who are interested in the Farmers Home      Administration's loan program should get in touch with      their FmHA county supervisor for more information. (He or      she will usually be located in the federal office at the      county seat . . . the address and telephone number can be      found in your Yellow Pages under "Government      Offices-U.S." among the listings for "Agriculture,      Department of". If you can't find a representative in your      area, try the agency's state office in the capital city.)    </p>    <p>      Even people who aren't eligible for the program, and yet      are curious about the houses themselves, can      obtain-for $5.00-plans for the latest (FmHA-2)      passive solar home. Good news should be shared, and the      Farmers Home Administration is more than willing to do just      that.    </p>
