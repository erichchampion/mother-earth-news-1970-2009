                <p>      <strong>Here's a "shaggy dog story" that could have a happy      ending for livestock owners who are plagued with predator      problems.</strong>    </p>    		<h3>WATCHDOG EXTRAORDINAIRE</h3>    <h5 id="byline">by Catherine Allen</h5>       <p>      We've all heard the phrase "a wolf in sheep's clothing",      but-not long ago-I encountered a dog in sheep's      clothing! The first time I saw a Komondor, I could scarcely      believe my eyes: The canine-which was covered with      long, white, matted hair- <em>did</em> look      remarkably like an overgrown ewe. In fact, as I watched it,      the animal even acted like a sheep . . . since it moved      along quietly with the flock, keeping its head down in what      appeared to be a grazing position.    </p>    <p>      However, Komondors don't for a moment imagine that they're      sheep. Instead, as a result of centuries of breeding and      in-born instinct, the dogs guard "their" flocks      against predators. Since the breed's introduction to North      America from its native Hungary just a few years back,      Komondors have helped sheep ranchers in both Canada and the      United States to reduce-dramatically-losses to      marauding carnivores.    </p>     <h3>AN "OLD WORLD" SOLUTION</h3>       <p>      Predators probably pose the greatest single threat to a      sheep raiser's livelihood. Wolves, coyotes, coydogs,      roaming domestic canines, and-in remoter      areas-even bears have been known to take a      devastating toll in the course of just one night's attack      on a flock. Furthermore, if such slaughter continues      unchecked, predation can actually put a small-scale sheep      operation right out of business!    </p>    <p>      The traditional methods of dealing with the      problem-shooting, trapping, "denning" (killing newborn      coyote pups in the den), and using poisons or electric      fences-seem to be only marginally effective and have      received, in many cases deservedly, a lot of criticism.      Shooting and trapping are, at best, only temporary measures      because of the sheer impossibility of eliminating the bulk      of the predatory animals in a given area . . . while      environmentalists are concerned about the danger of poisons      to other forms of wildlife, and disapprove of the inhumane      practice of denning. Fencing can offer some protection      against predators, of course, but it's doubtful whether      there exists a barrier strong enough and high enough to      repel a really determined invader.    </p>    <p>      In the face of such a dilemma, many sheep raisers have      rediscovered the traditional Old World method of protecting      flocks: guard dogs. Unlike the more common sheep-herding      breeds, guard canines don't try to move their charges . . .      they simply live with the flock-24 hours a day-and      drive off any attackers that may approach. Middle European      shepherds have relied on the vigilant animals for centuries      . . . and some of the best breeds from Hungary, Yugoslavia,      Russia, Italy, and Turkey are now being imported for "trial      assignments" in this hemisphere. So far, one of the most      highly rated of the "immigrant" dogs is the      shaggy-coated Komondor.    </p>       <h3>A CASE HISTORY</h3>       <p>      Canadians Tom and Joan Red-path are representative of the      modern shepherds who have happily "employed" Komondors as      protection for their flocks. The couple's 300-acre farm,      located at the edge of the bush country about 50 miles      northwest of Ottawa, has been a full-time sheep-raising      concern for over three years. From their very first week of      operation, the Redpaths were faced with the problem of      stock being killed by packs of wild dogs and wolves.    </p>    <p>      Well, after hearing from other sheep farmers-folks who were      already satisfied guard dog owners-the Red-paths      acquired Pandy, a female Komondor. Once Pandy was put to      work, her owners were amazed-and delighted-to      find that the sheep slaughter immediately stopped . . . and      they haven't lost a single member of their flock to      predators since the dog's arrival.    </p>    <p>      How does the couple account for this "miraculous" turn of      events? It's quite simple, Joan Redpath explains: "A      Komondor has a very strong protective instinct. It'll      defend whatever livestock it's with, as long as the animals      are inside its territory. In fact, the guard dogs have been      known to look after goats, horses, and even chickens."    </p>      <h3>THE TRAINING PROGRAM</h3>     <p>      However, the dogs' instinct alone isn't enough to make them      good guardians . . . in fact, turning a puppy loose with      sheep and expecting it to guard them right away is inviting      disaster. An untrained (or improperly trained) Komondor      can-as a result of its size and speed-be a      danger to the flock, and even to its human masters. The      dogs have an acute sense of territory, you see, and a      strong urge to attack all intruders. If the puppy isn't      allowed to become accustom-edquite early-to      living with its charges, it could view the sheep as      invaders.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, a thorough training program is crucial to the      development of an efficient guard dog. When the Redpaths      received their three-month-old pup, they immediately took      her to the barn to "introduce" her to the sheep . . . and      she was left there to eat and sleep with the flock. (Since      this bond between dog and sheep is so critical, some      breeders even encourage young pups to suckle nursing ewes.)    </p>    <p>      The next stage in a Komondor's education is to develop and      refine the animal's inherent territorial instinct . . . and      this is done by familiarizing the dog with the pasture      where it will work. Twice daily, for a number of weeks,      Joan walked Pandy around the boundary of the field.      Occasionally, Pandy was instructed to remain out in the      pasture while Joan returned to the house . . . and, in that      way, the animal gradually learned that her task was to stay      in the field with the sheep.    </p>    <p>      Another important aspect of the Komondor's training is      socialization. When they're mature, the dogs tend to be      somewhat aloof and suspicious of strangers . . . so it's      important that a Komondor-from puppyhood-have      frequent contact with a variety of people. After all, you      don't want a dog that will attack anything or anyone      happening to stray into its territory . . . including your      neighbors and friends! Therefore, a canine sentinel has to      be taught-by the example of the trainer-to      distinguish between friend and foe.    </p>    <p>      Although the Komondor is an intelligent creature and eager      to please the people it loves, there'll be occasional      lapses or mistakes during the training process, and some      form of correction must be applied in such cases. Physical      punishment, however-hitting the dog on the muzzle,      for instance-is not recommended. Most Komondor owners      agree that this breed doesn't respond well to such      conditioning, and may even turn on the trainer.      Fortunately, the Komondor-like most domesticated      animals-does respond readily to more subtle forms of      discipline. When they need to rebuke Pandy, the Redpaths      grasp her head firmly-just under the ears-and      shake it back and forth several times, while repeating      "No!" in a stern tone of voice. Once it has learned its      mission, however, a Komondor will be just about unsurpassed      in its ability to protect a flock. The dog will not      hesitate to react swiftly if it thinks the sheep are being      threatened . . . and its impressive speed (a Komondor can      easily outrun a coyote or wolf) and courage insure that the      canine guardian will almost always emerge as the victor in      a conflict with a marauding predator. Therefore, intruders      soon learn to be wary of crossing the invisible line that      separates the watchdog and its charges from the rest of the      world.    </p>        <h3>A HUNGARIAN BEAUTY</h3>     <p>      An adult Komondor is a physically imposing dog: A      full-grown male will stand upward of 25-1/2 inches at the      shoulder, and can weigh as much as 120 pounds. However, in      my opinion, the Komondor's coat is its most striking      feature. This is no street-variety "shaggy dog"! What might      appear (to the untrained eye) as unkempt mats of hair are      actually called "cords" . . . and they have several      important functions. In addition to repelling rain and      snow, the dangling, furry "ropes" further protect the      animal by acting as a thick armor against the sharp teeth      of an attacker.    </p>    <p>      Maintaining that unusual coat is no easy matter, however.      The dogs are particularly difficult to bathe and dry, and      grooming, therefore, requires a lot of patience and      persistence on the part of the owner. Joan remembers one      especially arduous session with Pandy: Only after a      six-hour workover with a tangle splitter, brush, and comb      did the animal's coat finally assume its characteristic      appearance of controlled disarray!    </p>     <h3>SATISFACTION GUARANTEED</h3>      <p>      Despite the extra effort involved in training and caring      for a Komondor, the Redpaths pronounce themselves      completely satisfied after the first three years with their      guard dog. Even though Pandy still occasionally leaves her      post to return to the house, she is doing her job in her      own way: The Redpath flock has remained unharmed since      Pandy's arrival, while sheep farmers in the area who use      noncanine defense measures continue to suffer losses. "Many      a night," says Joan, "I've been awakened from a dead sleep      to hear Pandy bulleting down the field, barking and keeping      the predators back.    </p>    <p>      "She's worth the price of my entire flock," Pandy's owner      declares . . . and that's a mighty good endorsement for the      Komondor!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: While a Komondor can indeed be an amazingly      efficient "sheep patrol", the dogs aren't inexpensive:      Well-bred, registered Komondors start at $400. Nor are they      terribly easy to obtain, . . . only about 30 registered      litters are produced in the U.S. each year. However, if      you're interested in the breed, you can contact the      official Komondor organization for free information and a      list of breeders. (You may also want to subscribe to the      society's official bi-monthly newsletter, Komondor News . .      . which is available-for $12 annually in the U. S. or      $14 in Canada or Mexico-frorn the same address.)      Write to Middle Atlantic States Komondor Club, Dept. TMEN,      102 Russell Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 . . . and      please enclose a dollar or two to cover the expenses of the      information packet they'll send you.    </p>
