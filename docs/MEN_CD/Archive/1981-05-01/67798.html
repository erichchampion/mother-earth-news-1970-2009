                <p>      Got a pooch that loves to root in your petunias? This      "secret weapon" will solve the problem!    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">by Marion B. Williams			</h5>        <p>      I tried all sorts of expensive commercial concoctions in an      attempt to keep my pups from digging in my flowerbeds . . .      only to discover that most of the formulas wouldn't work      for more than a few days per application, if they did the      job at all! However, I don't have such problems anymore,      because I've discovered a miraculous-and absolutely      free-substance that keeps the hounds away from my delicate      blooms for months at a time . . . dog manurel    </p>    <p>      Most canines, you see, are relatively tidy by nature, and      no self-respecting mutt will knowingly lie down in its own      (or another dog's) waste.    </p>    <p>      Now you don't have to use great piles of the material (I'm      not that eager to protect my plants) . . . a little goes a      long way. Simply scatter small pieces of dog droppings      around the area you want to protect. Once you're done, it      will be all but impossible for another person even to know      that the flowerbeds (or whatever) have been treated . . .      but the pooches will figure it out right away, and they'll      steer clear.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Don't spread dog manure in any vegetable      gardens. You can, however, distribute some      droppings-thinly-around the borders of your cropping      ground. They'll not only keep canines out, but will tend to      deter rabbits and such, too.    </p>
