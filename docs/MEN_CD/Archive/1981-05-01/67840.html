            		<p>      You don't have to "grow your own" to make a tidy part-time      profit from fruits and vegetables.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Gail Palmer    </h5>      	    <p>      My friend Carol Lea and I didn't go near a garden all last      summer, yet we netted nearly $35 a day selling produce. Our      source of fresh fruits and vegetables was a farmers' market      in Knoxville, Tennessee. We'd simply make a 40-minute      "produce run" from our home base in Pigeon Forge each day .      . . carefully select our purchases . . . load up our      just-the-right-size mini-pickup . . . and head back to the      mountains.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN OCCASIONAL ENTERPRISE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      We operated our peddling venture in an on-again-off-again      manner for most of the summer, since heavy rains frequently      put a damper on our business for days at a time. However,      the fact that our enterprise allowed us to work at our own      convenience-and still do fairly wellfar overshadowed      the occasional uncertainty of the operation.    </p>    <p>      The longest period during which we were able to "run the      roads" on a daily basis was a 20day rainless stretch during      the month of July. In the course of that dry spell-while we      were peddling only one not-really-full truckload each      trip-our average net per day came to $34.31, adding up to a      total 20-day profit of $686.20. We actually brought in      $1,633.85, but spent $808.23 for merchandise to resell,      $66.80 for gasoline for the truck, and $72.62 for      miscellaneous expenses, including ice and paper bags.      Furthermore, our earnings would have been greater if we      hadn't taken a long weekend off over the 4th of July, which      would certainly have been the most productive four days of      the whole summer.    </p>    <p>      The amount of fresh food we procured varied: Our smallest      daily load cost $32, and the largest set us back $85.75. Of      course, some items didn't have to be sold on the      first-or even on the second-day. Jars of honey, for      instance, were slow movers but good keepers, since we      didn't have to worry about spoilage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A TYPICAL DAY'S PURCHASE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      On an average day, our shopping list might look something      like this:    </p>        <p>      Another day, of course, we might want to try plums instead      of peaches (on occasion we couldn't find any peaches, but      plums would be plentiful), or we might decide to buy white      seedless grapes or nectarines instead, especially if we had      some peaches or plums left over from the previous day's      sales. Whatever items we bought, though, we always tried to      keep an interesting variety on hand . . . and aimed to      stock only food that would make people want to yank the      yummies right off our truck and pop them into their mouths!    </p>    <p>      As you'd imagine, time often limited the quantity of goods      we could handle in a day. When the Pigeon Forge tourist      season was in full swing, we were simply unable to hit each      campground on a daily basis. In fact, during the height of      the season, when most of the 1,469 drive-in spaces in      the area were occupied, it would sometimes take us up to      two hours just to work our way through one campground . . .      since-in addition to actual selling time-we spent      many minutes talking, reloading, and so forth.    </p>    <p>      We discovered that late afternoonfrom 3:00 p.m. until      dark-was the best time to catch people at their      "homes away from home". We were sometimes able to cover      only two campgrounds within those hours, but the hungry      hordes in just one or two areas would often descend on our      offerings with a vengeance and leave our pockets full and      our truck all but empty (not that we minded, you      understand). In such cases we'd simply have to wait until      the next day to buy a fresh load.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Actually, our produce business was originally intended to      be nothing more than a means of letting travelers through      the foothills of the Great Smokies know about our shop,      Tennessee's Mountain Peddler . . . where we market      countrysmoked ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, and craft items      (and whose name we displayed prominently on the produce      truck).    </p>    <p>      Because we were already in business, we were a jump ahead      of most folks who might want to try a venture of this sort.      All the legalities and technicalities-such as securing city      and county licenses, and learning about liability insurance      and sales tax requirements in our state-had long ago been      dealt with.    </p>    <p>      Of course, there was still plenty of start-up work to be      done. We had to visit the campground owners and managers,      for instance . . . to tell them of our plans and obtain      permission to pass through their property in order to sell      to their customers.    </p>    <p>      Most of the business folks were delighted with our idea. In      fact, they looked on it as a service they could provide to      the campers, and none of "our" owners ever charged us a fee      or commission . . . although they certainly appreciated the      few tomatoes, plums, or whatever that we'd leave for their      use when we started our rounds. We found that dropping by      with such gifts was a good way to say "thank you", since      most of the campground managers were too busy to do much      personal shopping.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING OUTFITTED</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Besides obtaining permission from the owners to sell in      their campgrounds, we had to gather some equipment before      starting our business. Our first necessity was a set of      scales. Fortunately, my partner's dad had an extra, which      he let us borrow. Had we marketed only things we could sell      on a "per item" basis, we wouldn't have needed scales.      Since we were going to be "per-pounding" most of the      produce, however, we had to have some means of weighing it.    </p>    <p>      Our decision to sell by the pound also dictated a need for      paper bags. At first we simply bought lunch bags in sets of      100 at the local supermarket . . . but that source turned      out to be unnecessarily expensive. The sacks cost about      98 cents for 100, compared to the $4.00 for 500 of the same      size that we eventually learned could be purchased from a      paper manufacturing company located in the same part of      town as the farmers' market. We wound up using two sizes:      No. 6 (holding about six pounds) for most items and No. 16      (16-pound capacity) for the larger produce, such as      cantaloupes or ears of corn.    </p>    <p>      And, let's face it, whenever you're selling anything, you      have to be able to make change . . . but nobody wants to      lug around a cashbox or cash register on a truck (or shell      out the extra loot to buy one, either). We found that a      carpenter's cloth nail bag (it cost $1.55 at our hardware      store) worked just fine for us. The sack allowed us to keep      change at our fingertips by simply tying on the apron and      stashing our cash in the pouches. ( We usually started out      each day with enough paper money to change a $20 bill, plus      $10 worth of coins.)    </p>    <p>      On our first few produce-purchasing rounds, we had to buy      bushel containers-along with the fruits and      vegetables-usually for 55 cents per basket. After that, we      simply swapped the containers when we went for more goods.      However, we did buy four half-bushel-baskets at our local      grocery store, for 99 cents each . . . since the smaller      containers fit on the side shelves of the truck. Our      bushels were then used to store additional goodies, in the      truckbed, which were kept available to restock our      displays.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A COVER STORY</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Not long after we started our business, we found ourselves      forced to come up with a cover for the back of the pickup.      Originally, Carol Lea and I-since our cash was      limited, and since we lacked the time we thought would be      needed to search out someone able to do (inexpensively) the      carpentry the job would require-just loaded up the      vehicle and made do with the tops from cardboard cartons,      or whatever other temporary shelter we could fashion, to      help protect all our "tender vittles".    </p>    <p>      We soon found out that, even so, a hot summer sun would      speed our products' demise, and we decided a "cover-up" was      essential. Luckily for us, though, another of my partner's      relatives came to our rescue. Before we knew it, we had a      homemade $50 "truck shed" . . . with a roof (that gave our      produce protection from the elements) and outwardly tilted      shelves that provided a marvelous way to show off our goods      as we meandered along the campground roads.    </p>    <p>      But even though the campers could see our displayed      produce, we always made a point of "hawking our wares" to      anyone we saw as we drove through. . . calling out      something like, "Need any tomatoes, cantaloupe, corn, or      watermelon today?" (People are sometimes a little shy about      being the first ones in line, but we found that if just one      brave soul stopped us, we'd soon be surrounded by other      people . . . including some who'd already answered "no" to      our inquiry!)    </p>    <p>      <strong>IT'S ALL IN THE BUYING</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Experience, they say, is the best teacher, and our first      summer taught us the importance of buying the right things      at the right time at the right price. In order to do so, of      course, we first had to give thought to the campers who'd      be our customers.    </p>    <p>      Most of the summertime road people are unable or unwilling      to take much food with them . . . in fact, the majority of      the folks we encountered told us they'd set out with no      more than enough eatables to last a couple of days. The      average camper doesn't have much space for perishable      items, since traveling food storage is usually limited to      an apartment-sized refrigerator or frequently just a picnic      cooler. And even though most campgrounds do make some      "staples" available (milk, bread, etc.), not many sell      fresh produce.    </p>    <p>      What's more, vacation time is adventure time for many      people, and part of the excitement consists of the chance      to try regional foods, including homegrown fruit and      vegetables or items the visited area is well known for . .      . such as a local variety of honey.    </p>    <p>      For all these reasons, then, most of the camping public      welcomed us when we pulled up, our truck loaded with almost      anything we figured folks could eat with little or no      preparation: peaches, grapes, bananas, apples, plums,      nectarines, cantaloupes, watermelons, tomatoes, corn, and      onions. (In our experience, such comestibles as cucumbers,      green peppers, beans, and okra would sell . . . but we were      never able to move them quickly enough to prevent our      losing money through spoilage.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BIGGER, THE BETTER</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      In most cases, the larger our offerings were, the more cash      people were ready to hand over in order to sample the      goods. However, the rule didn't hold true for watermelons.      Oversized melons are impressive, all right, but smaller      ones sold much better: Again, most campers simply don't      have enough space to store or to cool even a medium-sized      melon. In addition, the fact that we could offer the      smaller beauties already chilled-in a      used-but-not-abused 52-gallon wooden whiskey barrel that we      cut in half and transformed into two of the dandiest melon      and ice toters you've ever seen-insured that the      little globes would be good sellers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BARGAIN AND BEWARE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Since one of the secrets of successful produce marketing is      careful buying, we made a point of being picky . . .      inspecting every potential purchase with an eagle eye. Did      the fruit-we would ask ourselves-have a good      color? Was it firm, yet ripe enough to be eaten on that day      or the next . . . or was it too ripe to permit much      handling? And, of course, we always had to determine if it      was the very best quality we could find . . . on that      particular day and for the money we could spend.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, we quickly learned the value of dickering on      price. The sellers could always say no, but bargaining      often left more money in our pockets.    </p>    <p>      It didn't take us long, either, to discover the need for      caution when dealing with folks we didn't know. We found      that most people we bought produce from were honest, but      there were a few tricks we had to learn to watch out for.      One favored technique is "topping" . . . and it's often      used when packing peaches, tomatoes, and apples that are to      be sold by the bushel. In this deceptive game, the bottom      of the basket is filled with some really pretty fruit, the      middle is loaded with poor specimens, and the best are      saved for last . . . to be placed right on top where the      buyer can't miss 'em.    </p>    <p>      Even when the potential purchase is poured from the      seller's basket into the buyer's right before his or her      eyes, topping will be hard to spot . . . as the carefully      selected bottom layer will then wind up on top. We learned      about such deception the hard way. Inno cents that we were,      we bought one lovely-looking bushel of peaches without      checking "beneath the surface", and-sure enoughthose      in the center were cut and bruised so badly that we ended      up giving most of them away.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT TO CHARGE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      During the first weeks of our venture, we'd check the      grocery store prices dai ly, and try to sell our produce      for a little less than such outfits charged. However, we      soon found that this was unnecessary, as our customers      would let us know if we were overpricing or underpricing      anything: They simply didn't buy at all, or they'd buy like      crazy! Whenever either happened, we knew that we had to      make some immediate adjustments (usually by 10 cents per      pound up or down).    </p>    <p>      In most cases, our policy was to double our money on those      items we sold by the pound and add a $1.00 markup on      perunit goods such as watermelon or honey. And even though      we paid maybe 350 cents each for cantaloupes, we were able      to sell them for two different prices . . . usually      75 cents for small ones, and $1.00 for bigger melons.    </p>    <p>      The largest profit percentage we ever earned on one      purchase was made during July at a time when most northern      Tennessee home gardens weren't yet producing. Vine-grown      tomatoes were very much in demand, and we were able to buy      one 60-pound bushel of trucked-in "culls" for $5.00. (A      canning company had rejected them as "imperfect" because of      their markings.) We sold the bushel at 60 cents a pound      (which was less than the going retail rate at the time) and      cleared $31 on that one basket!    </p>    <p>      Much of the time, however, our prices would be determined      by the condition of our merchandise. The riper the fruits      and vegetables became, the lower we'd mark them. But, even      when items had gone beyond the selling point, they were      usually plenty good enough to eat. If use couldn't use the      overripes, we always tried to find someone (family or      friends) who could. Actually, the fact that we were able to      enjoy "first pick" as well as "last call" on all our      produce proved to be a fine little side benefit . . .      especially since we'd purchased the goods at bulkbuying      prices!    </p>    <p>      <strong>AT SUMMER'S END</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      As we looked back over that summer, we found that our      peddling venture had accomplished even more than we'd      initially hoped for. We were able to give our shop some      much-needed publicity through very personal contact with      people who would otherwise have been difficult to reach and      impress. We know we made more shop sales as a direct result      of seeking out the campers, since such customers would      often tell us that they'd seen our truck or had bought a      watermelon (or what have you) from us.    </p>    <p>      Best of all, instead of paying out $600 or more for the      kind of advertising that would have brought us to the      attention of a like number of people, we were able to bring      in well over that amount of cash, and still get the job      done. (We loved having our cake and eating it too! )    </p>    <p>      Besides that, we know we've stumbled on a good way to bring      in a little extra cash during the summer, regardless of      whatever else we might do or wherever else we might be. The      long holiday weekends-those that include Memorial Day, July      4th, and Labor Day-could be ideal targets for even      part-time campground produce peddlers . . . and, if you      grow your o-um eatables, your profits could be even bigger      than ours were!    </p>
