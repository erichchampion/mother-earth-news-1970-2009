                <p>      This shop project is simplicity itself, and produces a      danged useful "sitter".    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Dan and Madelyn Walker</h5>        <p>      If you've ever been stuck without a sturdy support to sit      on, you'll appreciate this simple stool . . . based upon a      design that's been used, for ages, by the Zapotec Indians      of southern Mexico. To make one, round up a five-foot      length of 1 X 12 (old shelving is fine), 16 four-penny      finishing nails, some white or yellow carpenter's glue, a      ruler, a protractor, and a saw.    </p>    <p>      Start by cutting the board into two 14" and two 16"      lengths, then trim a V-shaped 135Â° notch in one end of      each 14" section as shown (you can also remove a decorative      3-1/4" X 3-1/4" X 5" wedge from the opposite end of the two      components, if you wish). Next, from each of your remaining      two pieces of lumber, cut two (lengthwise) parts: the first      6-1/2" wide . . . the other only 2" wide and lopped down to      14" in length. Now place one of the 6-1/2" X 16" seat      halves, temporarily, into position on one slope of the      V-notch, and mark the inside edge of the slanted board so      you'll be able to trim off an appropriate-sized sliver (in      order to allow the plank to meet its "mate" smoothly).      Repeat the process with the other seat portion to complete      the mitered V-joint ... then fashion two 3/4" X 2" notches      in each of the stool's leg planksmidway between top and      bottom-to accommodate the struts.    </p>        <p>      With all the pieces trimmed to size, assemble your project      by simply "whitegluing" the parts together and securing      them with finishing nails, as illustrated in the drawing.      (Yes, the seat is supposed to extend beyond the legs      slightly!) After giving it a light sanding, you'll find      that this very uncomfortable-looking stool is actually a      pleasure to sit on . . . because the handmade hassock was      designed with the behind in mind!    </p>
