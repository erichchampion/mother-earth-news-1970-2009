    <p>
                    <p>      In 1976 Tom Ferguson, then a fourth-year medical student at      Yale, launched a magazine called Medical Self-Care . . .      which-he hoped-would serve as "a Whole Earth      Catalog of the best medical books, tools, and resources".    </p>    <p>      Tom spoke of his plans for the publication and of his      conviction that self-care could raise the general level of      health in this country and lower our inflated levels of      medical spending-in the Plowboy Interview in MOTHER      NO. 51 . . . and left no doubt that he would work toward      making those "dreams" come true.    </p>    <p>      Well, Tom Ferguson is Doctor Ferguson now, and the medical      self-care "movement"-as well as Tom's      magazine-has flourished. People are beginning to      assume more responsibility for their own well-being and are      eager for information that will help them take better care      of their bodies.    </p>    <p>      So-in an effort to provide just such very necessary      data-THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> offers as a regular      feature a piece by Tom Ferguson, M.D., entitled (what      else?) "Medical SelfCare".    </p>       <p>      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: This issue's column is by Michael      Castleman, managing editor of Medical Self-Care.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Two years ago, investigators at the UCLA Pulmonary Research      Laboratory published the abstract of a study on the      respiratory effects of heavy marijuana smoking among 75      young men who consumed an average of five marijuana      cigarettes, or joints, a day for two months. Among other      less dramatic findings, this "Tashkin Report" suggested:      "Smoking four joints a week may cause more respiratory      impairment than smoking 16 cigarettes a day."    </p>    <p>      The wire service that picked up the story dropped the word      "may" . . . and the nation learned that the lung damage      caused by four joints equaled that caused by 112      cigarettes.    </p>    <p>      Later that year, Peter Bensinger (a director of the federal      Drug Enforcement Agency) told a graduating class at the FBI      Academy that smoking five joints a week introduced more      carcinogens into the lungs than smoking a pack of      unfiltered cigarettes a day. His remarks were also picked      up by the wire services.    </p>    <p>      Extrapolations like these occur with disturbing frequency.      Because marijuana is controversial-and      illegal-the atmosphere surrounding its health effects      is highly charged, and the available data conflict at      almost every turn. In fact, if all marijuana researchers      are correct in their methodological criticisms of each      other's work, none of the reported results can be trusted.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, no reputable au thorities argue that      "grass" is completely safe . . . not even the legalization      lobby, the National Organization for the Reform of      Marijuana Laws (NORML). Clearly, lung cells are extremely      delicate, and any long-term exposure to hot particulate      combustion products-which contain a large number of      carcinogens-can be assumed to cause some damage.    </p>    <p>      The question is, how much harm is caused by how much      smoking? The research, contradictory as it is, falls into      two general categories . . . indicating either that pot is      "not all that harmful" or that it's "very harmful".    </p>        <h3>"NOT ALL THAT HARMFUL"</h3>     <p>      The best collection of papers indicating that marijuana is      relatively benign-even when used to excess-is      "Chronic Cannabis Use", published by the New York Academy      of Sciences. The report chronicles studies in Costa Rica      and Jamaica dealing with a wide range of health variables      in heavy marijuana smokers,    </p>    <p>      as compared to non-pot-smoking controls. "Heavy" use in      Jamaica would be considered nonstop smoking by United      States standards, since the average user tested had      consumed seven high-potency joints a day for 17.5 years.    </p>    <p>      The studies compared smokers' and nonsmokers' physical      exams, electrocardiograms, blood, immunity to infection,      testosterone levels, chest X-rays, lung function, and      chromosome integrity . . . and showed "no significant      differences between the two groups in the wide range of      tests administered".    </p>       <h3>"VERY HARMFUL"</h3>   <p>      The leading researcher with a negative perspective is      Gabriel Nahas-an anesthesiologist at Columbia      University in New York-who summarized the case      against marijuana last year in the Journal of the American      Medical Association. He reported that cannabis use      interfered with cell division . . . harmed lung tissue      significantly, with the damage persisting long after      cessation of smoking . . . lowered the lungs' defenses      against bacteria "substantially more" than does tobacco . .      . reduced sperm counts and decreased testosterone levels      (although these effects were reversible after the users      stopped smoking marijuana) . . . caused birth defects . . .      hindered brain function . . . impaired judgment while      driving . . . and perhaps (this point was not considered      proven) triggered epileptic seizures.    </p>       <h3>TWO OFFICIAL PERSPECTIVES</h3>     <p>      Two organizations have attempted to make sense of the      conflicting data: NIDA (a division of the U.S. Department      of Health and Human Services) and its Canadian counterpart,      the Addiction Research Foundation (a branch of the Ontario      Ministry of Health). Neither of the organizations can be      considered a completely disinterested observer . . . since      their funding comes from legislative bodies which have kept      marijuana illegal. But despite possible bias, the reports      are fairly consistent with each other and provide      reasonable overviews of the current "official" consensus on      the adverse effects of this drug. Here are the agencies'      conclusions:    </p>    <p>      [1] Smoking pot irritates the throat and lungs and may      cause bronchitis in heavy users.    </p>    <p>      [2] Careful comparison of smoke condensates shows that one      joint deposits about 50% more "tar" in the lungs than does      one nonfiltered cigarette, largely because joints tend to      be smoked down to smaller butts, and pot smokers typically      hold the smoke in their lungs longer.    </p>    <p>      [3] Marijuana's smoke has as many carcinogenic polycylic      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) as tobacco smoke does,      although some PAH's-benzopyrene, for      example-are more abundant in pot smoke, while others      are less. Marijuana, however, contains neither      nicotine-which is a very potent poison-nor (in      most cases) the pesticide residues typically found in      tobacco smoke, which may accelerate the tumor-inducing      effects of PAH's.    </p>    <p>      [4] The use of marijuana increases the heart rate and may      prove hazardous to those with heart diseases. It also      reduces testosterone levels in men to the lower end of the      normal scale . . . though these levels do rise again after      the cessation of smoking. The drug also appears to reduce      both sperm count and sperm motility. The active ingredient      in marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),      apparently stimulates these changes, because it binds to      estrogen (the female hormone) receptors and exerts "a weak,      but significant" estrogenic effect. (This activity may be      the reason why there've been anecdotal reports of breast      development, gynecomastia, in men who were heavy users.)    </p>    <p>      [5] THC crosses the placenta and has been found in the milk      of lactating laboratory animals, and large doses of THC      have been shown to increase the fetal death rate in rhesus      monkeys.    </p>    <p>      [6] Marijuana may suppress certain immune responses in the      lungs, making users more susceptible to infection, but the      research is inconclusive, and this question hasn't been      fully investigated in humans.    </p>    <p>      [7] Users freely admit that the drug causes disorientation,      and school officials have expressed concern about what they      refer to as the "antimotivational syndrome" associated with      pot use.    </p>    <p>      [8] Marijuana impairs driving performance, and-when      pot is used with alcohol-the user's ability to      operate a vehicle deteriorates even further.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Dr. Tow Ferguson's quarterly journal,      Medical SelfCare, is available for $15 per year from      Medical Self-Care,, Dept.
