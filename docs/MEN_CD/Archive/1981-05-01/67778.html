                <p>      Add a little music to your porch, yard, or garden (where it      just might keep seed-stealing birds away) with ...<br />    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Christopher Nyerges</h5>         <p>      It's easy to make your own backyard "aeolian orchestra" out      of string . . . small nuts or washers . . . and tin can      tops. To begin, simply remove the lids from a number of      containers (different sizes will produce different tones),      and cut four thin "pie" sections from each one, using wire      cutters or tinsnips (see the illustration).    </p>    <p>      With that done, fold the disks into flat-sided shapes as      shown, and fit each one with a string-and-washer clapper.      The finished bells can be hung singly . . . one above the      other (from largest to smallest or vice versa) . . . or      even in a tinkling mobile of your own design.    </p>    <p>      And despite the fact that the chimes can be made from scrap      materials in a few minutes' time, it would be hard to put a      price on the soothing sound of their gentle singing on a      warm June night!    </p>
