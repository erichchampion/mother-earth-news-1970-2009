                <p>      MOTHER NO. 61 featured an article describing how to relieve      pain and promote healing by using six basic "acupressure"      points. Now, here's...    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">by Michael Blate </h5>		 <p>      There are four things that can turn a wonderful hike into      an absolutely miserable experience: sunburn, bug bites,      poison ivy, and twisted ankles. At home, such ills might      seem like small inconveniences, but when one is dealing      with backpacks, bedrolls, and the thought that there are      long miles to go before the itch or pain is relieved, even      minor troubles can become major psychophysical health      problems to all but the heartiest of trekkers.    </p>        <p>      Fortunately, there's a drugless, immediately effective      method of relieving those problems, as well as about 250      other ailments and injuries we're likely to encounter      during our lives. It's called G-Jo.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A BRIEF OVERVIEW</strong>    </p>    <p>      G-Jo (which means "first aid" in Chinese, but is actually      much more than just an interesting first aid method) has      two simple operating rules: Find the right acupressure      point to relieve your symptom(s), and stimulate that point      properly.    </p>    <p>      Of course, in order to find the correct spot, you'll first      need to know which of the 116 G-Jo points is best for your      problem, and then you'll have to determine its precise      location. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Each G-Jo point is detailed in      The Natural Healer's Acupressure Handbook: G-Jo Fingertip      Technique, available at many bookstores or libraries or      from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28791 for $9.95, plus 95d shipping and handling.]      Generally, there are several of the pinheadsized areas      that-when stimulated-will relieve a symptom,      and it's not unusual to have as many as 15 or 20 to choose      from ... one or two of which will be profoundly effective.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO HIT THE SPOT</strong>    </p>    <p>      In order to locate a specific pressure pointfor example,      G-Jo No. 2, an excellent choice for relieving the      discomforts of poison ivy, sunburn, and other minor burns      or skin irritations-you'll need to use the tip, not      the pad or fleshy part, of your thumb or finger. Begin by      probing as deeply as you can in the appropriate area . . .      in the case of G-Jo No. 2, on the outside of the arm at the      end of the crease found at the crook of the elbow. First,      though, straighten your arm and relax it, since it's much      more difficult to locate a point if the area's muscles are      tense. Now, with the tip of the thumb-using your left      digit if you're probing your right arm and vice      versa-poke around deeply until you discover a very      tender "ouch" spot.    </p>    <p>      A G-Jo point will, when pressed, produce a unique feeling      somewhat akin to the throb of a pinched nerve or toothache.      Probing an area even as little as 1/4 to 1/2 inch away will      cause a vastly different sensation. In addition, a good      point will often make you break out in an immediate flush      of perspiration-or create a sudden sense of      relaxation or feeling of warmth-when it's deeply      stimulated.    </p>    <p>      While each G-Jo spot is located in a different part of the      body, the rules for finding and using the points are      generally the same. First, locate the proper place with a      deep, probing pressure from the thumb tip . . . the bent      knuckle of the index finger . . . or even the end of a      pencil, pen, etc. (you can use anything that's not sharp      and that can safely generate up to the 20 pounds of      pressure needed to find some of the points). Then stimulate      it with a deep, digging or goading massage. Get in there      and really work the point around! Usually, just 15 or 20      seconds of this admittedly sometimes painful process will      be enough to bring profound relief.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that most G-Jo points are stimulated      bilaterally . . . that is, after you've found and goaded a      point on one side of your body, you should duplicate that      procedure on the opposite side.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A FEW RULES TO OBSERVE</strong>    </p>    <p>      If, then, you can tolerate the few seconds of      toothache-like throbbing-a pain that often      actually "hurts good"-you'll have a sure-fire      "anesthetic" that you can employ anytime relief from      discomfort is needed. However, there are a few people who      shouldn't use this technique: specifically pregnant women,      patients suffering from severe heart problems, and folks      who wear pacemakers. Such men and women should generally      avoid G-Jo, except in times of emergency.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, folks who do use acupressure should observe a      few precautions. Don't-for example-employ G-Jo      within several hours after taking drugs, medications,      alcohol, or other intoxicants. Don't use a point that lies      beneath a scar, mole, wart, or other blemish (try another      spot, instead). Wait for about half an hour before using      G-Jo if you've just taken a hot bath, eaten a heavy meal,      or done strenuous exercise. And, if you find you have to      restimulate a point more than four or five times a      day-or use G-Jo for a problem for more than four or      five days in a rowrecognize that either you're using the      wrong spot or your illness/injury is beyond the scope of      acupressure, and it's time to see your doctor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BANISH BUG-BITE BOTHER</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are two good pressure points for dealing with the      painful sting of, say, a bee or yellow jacket. The first      one (which I used successfully to help a young boy who'd      been attacked by a swarm of angry hornets) is G-Jo No. 20.    </p>    <p>      The spot is found along a diagonal line between the crown      of the inner ankle and the tip of the heel. Press deeply,      and you can't miss it. Stimulate this point immediately      after getting stung or bitten. Then-if the pain      returns later-simply repeat the procedure as soon as      you notice the discomfort returning!    </p>    <p>      Your goal, of course, will be to give yourself increasing      spans of relief between necessary restimulations. One or      two massages will often completely eliminate the pain of an      injury (that was the case with the boy's hornet stings) . .      . but, occasionally, it will take a few more applications      than that. You should get at least an hour's relief from      minor symptoms after the first stimulation, if you've used      the right points properly.    </p>    <p>      The second bug-bite relief spot-G-Jo No. 24-is also located      on the foot and is useful in relieving sunburn, too! You'll      find it on the outside edge of either foot, just in back of      the bulge that's directly behind the little toe. (Run the      tip of your thumb or finger back from the little toe . . .      around the bulge ... then dig in!) This spot will be      particularly tender if you're suffering from either sunburn      or bug-bite pain, and is, therefore, usually not hard to      locate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOOTHE A SPRAIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      G-Jo No. 72 is a good point to use for twisted or swollen      ankles. It's found about two inches-twice the width of your      thumb, actually-above the crown of the inner ankle bone, on      a vertical line slightly behind that bony bulge. If you      twist or sprain your ankle, immediately reach for that      point and goad it. And don't forget, if you notice any      discomfort returning, to be sure to restimulate the same      spot right away.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE "POINT" OF THE MATTER . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      Summer's warm weather provides many opportunities for most      of us to get out and about, and such outdoor activity,      coupled with the hazards that accompany the sunny season,      can sometimes result in problems. But you can handle      summer's itches and minor ills without resorting to      drugstore sprays or stomachharming medicine-chest tablets.      The key to quick and effective relief often lies in simply      helping your body ease its own aches and pains!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like a free chart of six other      basic G-Jo points (those covered in MOTHER NO. 61), send      along, self-addressed, stamped envelope to The G-Jo      Institute, Dept.
