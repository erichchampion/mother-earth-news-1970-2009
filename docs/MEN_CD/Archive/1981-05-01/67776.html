                <p>      Here's a valuable, easy, and inexpensive (under $5.00)      project for outdoor photographers.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Barbara Bresnahan    </h5>        <p>      When you're spending time in the great      outdoors-hiking, backpacking, skiing, or what have      you-it's often difficult to find a convenient way to      carry along a 35mm camera. Well, I've solved that problem      with a dandy harness that can be made, in about 30 minutes,      for around $4.00. . . and it's the equal of similar devices      sold in camera stores for $14 or more!    </p>    <h3>      READY IN A SECOND    </h3>    <p>      As an outdoor writer and photographer, I take my camera      almost everywhere I go, and I've found no better way to      keep it secure and accessible than this handy, homemade      harness. One day, for instance, when my husband and I were      backpacking on the Continental Divide, a coyote suddenly      appeared, moving at a comfortable lope, about 50 yards in      front of us. At that pace, the animal disappeared among the      trees in about 15 seconds, but-since my camera was      waiting, practically under my nose-I was able to get      a good photo of the beast.    </p>    <p>      The harness also comes in handy when I join a bunch of      friends to go downhill skiing. With my equipment snugly      secured and just a jacket zipped up over it, I can whip my      handy 35mm out . . . take several shots . . . stick it back      inside my coat . . . and be on my way. Furthermore, my      camera stays warm, so there's no danger of battery failure.      And now that I'm so quick on the draw, my friends' aversion      to my picturetaking has substantially lessened . . . since      they no longer have to ward off frostbite while I fumble      with my cumbersome gear.    </p>    <h3>      SHOP AROUND AND SAVE    </h3>    <p>      The materials you'll need can be found at several kinds of      stores, so look for bargains. Shoe repairshops, for      example, may have the least expensive price on elastic, but      generally stock it only in black and brown. (If you want a      white camera holder, you can simply buy your elastic in any      store that sells sewing notions.)    </p>    <p>      My shopping list for the project looked like this:    </p>        <p>      Try checking out a tent and awning or sailmaking      establishment to find the lowest price on nylon webbing.      Snaps and 'slides can be found in such places, too . . . or      in sporting goods shops that specialize in camping gear.      Hardware outlets may also have them, and will certainly      carry the needed split-or key-rings. (The      split-ring assemblies go between the camera and the harness      to prevent the snap buckles from scratching the camera's      finish. If you now use a regular neck strap, you may      already have these sections ... in which case you'll have      saved a step.)    </p>    <h3>PUT IT ALL TOGETHER</h3>        <p>      To assemble a split-ring adapter, position two rings about      3 inches apart. Connect the pair with a strip of material      (or sturdy seambinding tape), overlapped for strength, and      stitch a zig-zag pattern back and forth between the rings.      Make two of these units and attach one to each side of your      camera.    </p>    <p>      For step two, sear the ends of the webbing with a match or      candle to melt the strands together and prevent any      raveling. Next, thread a slider onto one end of the webbing      and move it up about 8 inches, then slip on a snap buckle      and thread the end-again-through the slider.      Now, fold the end back (toward the snap buckle) about 2 to      3 inches and sew it to the webbing. You should wind up with      a small loop around the middle bar of the slider. Then      repeat the entire process for the other end.    </p>    <p>      The final step is to sew the elastic to the middle of the      strap. Before you do so, however, wrap the expandable      material around your smallest diameter lens. Stretch it      enough to hold the lens tightly, and allow another 1-1/2"      for overlapping. (It's best to make a "test run" with pins      before you sew the circle closed.) Once you're satisfied      with the positioning, attach the elastic loop to the      webbing with two rows of stitching, about 1-1/2 inches      apart . . . and your project is complete.    </p>    <h3>      WEAR IT IN COMFORT    </h3>        <p>      To don the harness, place the middle of the strap over your      solar plexus . . . cross it in the back . . . bring one end      over each shoulder . . . snap on your camera . . . and      stick the lens through the elastic.    </p>    <p>      When you've tightened the carrier properly (it's best to      have someone help you with the final fit), the camera will      hug your body no matter how you move or bend, and its      weight will be supported primarily by your shoulders and      back ... not by your neck. Also, since the lens will point      downward, you'll be able to carry telephoto and zoom      attachments comfortably. What's more, the harness is fully      adjustable . . . it'll fit broadshouldered men, as well as      petite women. You can even throw it in the washing machine.      (If you'd like to use the same sort of device to hold      binoculars, simply make two separate elastic loops, one for      each lens.)    </p>    <p>      Since this camera-toter is less fatiguing to wear than is a      single neck strap, you'll find that you carry your      photography gear to more places,      and-consequently-will be sure to take some fine      photos that you'd have missed otherwise.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For information about how to earn cash with      some of your best photos, turn to the article on page 132.    </p>
