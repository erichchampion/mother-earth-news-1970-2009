                       <p>      SPECIAL NOTE: <em>GROW IT!</em> is a big book and even if a      chunk this size were to be run in issue after issue after      issue of MOTHER, it would take over two years to put the      complete volume in your hands. If you haven't got two years      to play around with, we recommend that you truck on down to      your nearest book store and shell out $8.95 for your very      own copy of GROW IT! That way, Richard Langer will be      happy, Saturday Review Press will be happy . . . and we're      betting that you'll be happy too. It's a darn good book.    </p>    <p>      EXTRA SPECIAL NOTE: All material here reprinted from GROW      IT! Copyright Â© <strong>1972</strong> by Richard W.      Langer.    </p>    <p>      At last! For the first time since the HAVE-MORE Plan was      published way back in 1940', a fellow named Richard W.      Langer has come up with a 365-page book that really      introduces a beginner to small-scale farming. Wanna raise      your own fruit, nus. berries, vegetables, grain, chickens.      pigs, like it, and here's another chapter from the book.    </p>    <p>      <em>Loveliest of trees, the cherry now<br />      Is hung with bloom along the bough,<br />      And stands about the woodland ride<br />      Wearing white for Eastertide.</em><br />      -A.E. HOUSMAN    </p>    <p>      <em>All worms have an apple,<br />      But not all apples have a worm<br /></em> -PETER      REEVES    </p>    <p>      There's no place on the farm quite like the orchard. For      dew-fresh fruit, but also for picnics in blossom time,      watching the bees gather nectar for your honey, and simply      enjoying life. Making a detour on your way to feed the      chickens in the morning and stopping by the orchard for a      night-chilled Transparent apple is a country experience      hard to pass up.    </p>    <p>      The only problem is, unless your land comes with an      established orchard, it's going to take a couple of years'      wait. That's why the orchard should be one of the first      things you set out. If, as is likely, you move to the      country in spring or summer, planning your grove of fruit      trees right away and getting the trees in time for fall      planting will give you a year's head start over putting it      off till you're settled in. Even if you don't have time to      get the trees, you can sow a green manure crop of rye to      help prepare the land for early spring planting the next      year. Fruit trees can be set in either season as long as      they are naturally dormant when transplanted.    </p>    <p>      To speed up your first yield even further, try a few dwarf      trees. You probably won't bother much with these once your      big ones start bearing, but they will give you an initial      crop to tide you over the second or third year of waiting.    </p>		<p><strong>ORCHARD LOCATION</strong></p>    <p>      The orchard is going to be around for some time. That's      your first consideration in deciding where to locate it.      You can put a vegetable garden on a slope that you expect      to be part of a pond in a few years. To do so with the      orchard would be a waste of either orchard or pond.    </p>    <p>      As a permanent addition to your homestead, the orchard      should have not only good soil, but good air and water      drainage as well. Thus a slope is the best location if you      have one. Avoid low-lying sites, since these harbor the      cold in winter, making any trees there more likely      candidates for winter-killing than others in the area. A      northern slope will delay blooming and subsequent fruit. A      southern slope will speed up both. The ideal spot is on the      small hills surrounding a valley or depression. Trees with      early frost-sensitive blossoms can be planted halfway up      the northern slope, the less sensitive trees halfway up the      southern slope. No trees should be exposed to the windy      hilltops and none to the frost-retentive bottom land. Rows      of trees planted on hills should, of course, follow the      contour system.    </p>    <p>      The soil in your orchard should be as good as you can make      it. If you want to plant fruit trees right away and your      soil is hard clay or sand, you'll have to build it up for      each individual tree. It will pay you to fill the      excavations in which the trees are to be set with improved      soil, compost, rotted manure, ground rock phosphate, and      rock potash to a depth of-hold onto the      book-about five feet.    </p>    <p>      If you've ever dug a five-foot hole, you'll have some idea      of what it's like to dig ten of them, or twenty, or however      many as the fruit trees you're going to plant. The minimum      would be two, since you should never plant just one tree of      a given fruit if you want a good crop. There are two      solutions to the labor problem. Either get someone with a      hack hoe - other mechanical excavator to come in and make      holes for you. Or plant just two or three trees the first      year, which will give you a good head start, and spend the      rest of the year building up the soil for the others with      cover crops of rye and clover alternated with liberal      manuring. Another possibility is to set out a couple of      dwarf fruit trees near the house, and leave the orchard be      entirely until you've built up the soil for it thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you may be lucky and have an orchard site with      soil of good enough quality to use just as it is. What you      want is a nice medium loam rich in organic material, but      also with some sand. If you have straight clay or heavy      sand, start digging.    </p>    <p><strong>PLANTING</strong></p>    <p>      Even if your soil is ideal, prepare to spend a bit of time      with a pickax and shovel. The minimum size for a tree hole      is three times the size of the root ball. In the case of      fruit trees, the bigger the better. Usually one no smaller      than three or four feet in diameter and two to three feet      deep is dug. Pile the topsoil separately, since this is      what should go back into the bottom of the hole along with      well-aged nitrogen-rich compost and ground rock phosphate      and rock potash. Don't use fresh manure. Spread most of the      extra subsurface soil elsewhere and grow a cover crop over      it.    </p>    <p>      If what you're removing is almost solid clay soil, and      you're replacing it with the ideal light, humus-filled one,      the improved area around the tree will act as a sponge.      Water retention will be too much. In this case, put a tile      drain at the bottom of the hole. This is simply a single      row, or a cross, of sections of drainage pipe, usually four      inches in diameter, spaced out on top of a layer of gravel      across the floor of the hole. It leads the water away from      the root area, culvert-fashion, to the surrounding subsoil.    </p>    <p>      The mechanics of planting fruit trees are important. All      injured and broken roots must be pruned back. The roots are      then spread out evenly on top of a layer of enriched soil      replaced in the hole to raise the tree to its proper level.      Make sure you keep the roots moist while you work. It's a      good idea to mix up a bucket of mud slurry from your      compost to pour over the roots when they are spread out.      The slurry will coat the finer roots, keeping them moist,      minimizing air pockets, and helping to settle them in. Fill      the rest of the hole, tamp down the soil and give it a      heavy dousing of water or light mud slurry. The tree should      sit in the center of a slight depression about a foot in      diameter. At the same distance out put up a two-foot-high      wire mesh "collar" to keep out field mice, rabbits, etc.      Outside of this mini-fence cover the ground with an inch of      rotted manure extended all the way to eight feet from the      tree. Cover the circle in turn with about a foot of hay      mulch.    </p>        <p>      A regular fruit tree should be planted at least twenty feet      from its nearest neighbor. Dwarf fruit trees can be spaced      as close as ten feet apart. Set the tree straight to ever      so slightly leaning in the direction of any prevailing      winds. The largest branch, like a weather vane, should      point into the prevailing wind. Prune back the branches of      a newly planted tree a little more, proportionately, than      the root loss. This will give it a chance to build a good      strong root system. Give the trunk a pole support to      prevent wind whipping from loosening the roots.    </p>        <p>      One final thought on planting. Science is discovering more      and more about the roles bacteria and fungi play in crop      growth. There are no doubt some of both interacting with      the orchard. An old farmer I know would never plant a new      fruit or nut tree without going around to an orchard he      particularly admired and, picking the best tree of the kind      he was planting, "borrowing" a shovelful of dirt as a      "starter" for his own tree. Now I'm not saying this is      necessary . . . the only reason I mention it is because his      new trees never failed, and they were always covered in      season with the most incredibly delicious fruit.    </p>    <p><strong>MAINTENANCE</strong></p>    <p>      Even organic gardeners spray their trees. Lest this make      you sit up and wonder what happened to the natural      approach, the spray referred to is not DDT or one of the      countless other chemicals used by many commercial orchards.      What the organic gardener uses is a miscible oil spray. It      is a dormant spray, one applied before a tree begins its      annual growth and which disappears before the leaves begin      to emerge. Instead of poisoning insects, and the tree with      them, a miscible oil spray simply puts your fruit tree in a      temporary Baggie, suffocating everything that moves inside      . . . except the tree, which is dormant. If it's not, well,      you take it from there. Even miscible oil sprays call for      caution and common sense in using, but, properly applied,      they will not harm your trees.    </p>    <p>      Miscible oil sprays for dormant spraying are available in      concentrated form through mail order and probably from      nurseries in your area. Dilute and use according to the      instructions. If you have an old established orchard on      your spread and are trying to rehabilitate it, miscible oil      sprays may not seem to be much protection at first because      of the sheer number of bugs around. But have patience and      eventually you will restore the natural balance. With new      orchards and healthy, well-fertilized stock, miscible oil      sprays should keep most of your problems in check from the      start.    </p>		<p><strong>FERTILIZING</strong></p>    <p>      Early in spring, a month or so before a tree blooms, work      into the soil around it some high-nitrogen fertilizer. A      quarter of a pound of blood meal or eight pounds of manure      for each year's growth is about right. Cover with a new      layer of straw or hay mulch, keeping the area immediately      around the base of the tree clear to discourage mice. For      the little ring around the trunk, work in a two- or      three-inch layer of well-aged compost instead. The compost      should not actually raise the soil level at the trunk      itself, or it may induce rot. A rule of thumb for young      trees is to build the fertilizer layer out in a circle      encompassing the widest branch of the tree.    </p>   <h3> apples</h3>    <p>      There are over a thousand apple varieties, which gives you      plenty to choose from. A few well-tested varieties, such as      Gravenstein, Golden Delicious, Grimes, Rome Beauty, and      Yellow Transparent, should be the basic stock of your      orchard, but try some of the lesser-known ones as well.      Apple trees tend to bring surprises, and a well-cared-for      minor variety may give you the most wonderful fruit.    </p>    <p>      Apples will grow almost anywhere in the United States      except in the hottest regions. They need the cool-to-cold      winters during dormancy. Your local nursery will no doubt      give you an indication of not only the feasibility of      growing apples, but the best varieties for that area as      well.    </p>		<p><strong>STOCK</strong></p>    <p>      Apple trees, except for the dwarfs, which bear small crops      in their second or third year, usually won't give you any      apples until their fifth to sixth year. But by the tenth      year they're at peak production, yielding five to ten      bushels per tree per year. And they will keep bearing for      thirty years or more. So order two varieties at the very      least. Not just because thirty or forty bushels of one kind      might become a bit boring, but because some are eating      apples and some for cooking. Also cross-fertilization will      increase your crop. Stock usually comes in one-, two-, or      three-year-olds. You'll find the older ones more expensive,      of course. On the other hand, being transplants, they are      usually sturdier trees. Bought from a good nursery, two- to      three-year-olds are your best bet.    </p>       <p><strong> PRUNING</strong></p>    <p>      If you buy two- or three-year-old transplants, they should      need no pruning the first two years besides the initial one      on planting to eliminate injured roots and take the wood      down a bit proportionately.    </p>    <p>      After the first two years, your primary pruning job will be      to make the tree easy to pick from and somewhat squat in      shape. The center of the tree must be kept open . . . don't      let the growth get too dense. Cut off branches that cross      and rub against each other in the wind. Any branch so large      it can't be pruned off with shears, should be cut in three      stages with a saw, as shown in the diagram.    </p>    <p>      As the tree grows older, you will notice small, short      cluster branches of buds developing along the real      branches. These must not be cut off . . . they're the      bearing spurs that will give you your fruit.    </p>    <p>      The spurs will bear lovely flowers . . . in fact, too many      of them. If you walk through your orchard one day during      blossom time and notice a host of pink and white petals      falling, don't faint. It's quite natural. The tree would      otherwise bear far too much fruit for it to carry and these      dropping flowers are its natural way of cutting back the      crop. Even so, once the fruit sets, you will probably have      to tree-cull some of it. Don't let the young apples crowd      each other. Not only can their weight break the branch, but      too many apples spoil the crop.    </p>    <p><strong>PROBLEMS</strong></p>    <p>      Preventative care and healthy, well-nourished trees will      minimize problems. However, there are some regions of the      country in which cedar rust, scab, or fire blight readily      attack apple trees. In these areas resistant varieties are      grown. By taking the simple precaution of finding out from      your county agent what the pests in your region are and      selecting the appropriate resistant species, a lot of      disappointment will be avoided.    </p>    <p>      The second problem-solving rule is, if it looks unhealthy,      get rid of it. Branches with mildew or an area of      prematurely yellow, withered leaves should be pruned out,      and fallen spoiled apples or infected fruit removed. Don't      leave sickly cuttings in the neighborhood of your trees.      All diseased branches should be burned in a hot fire a good      distance from your orchard.    </p>    <p>      The first week in June hang a trap on each of your trees      for bugs. Use a wide-mouthed jar covered with a coarse wire      mesh with holes just small enough not to admit bees. Fill      it half full with a solution of one part molasses to ten      parts water. A bit of yeast helps things along. Hang the      jar on the southern side of the trunk. This will attract      all sorts of nonsense. You'll even end up with a couple of      persistent young honeybees in the wrong pot. It will also,      however, eliminate most of the apple flies, whose maggots      have an annoying habit of tunneling into your apples. Keep      the traps up for the rest of the bearing season.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if the answer (Finding half a worm.) to      "What's worse than biting into an apple and finding a      worm?" doesn't bother you, the bug trap may not be      necessary at all. The easiest solution, of course, is to      share the apples with your livestock . . . they get the      culled wormy ones.    </p>    <p><strong>HARVESTING</strong></p>    <p>      Pick apples sun-ripe, naturally. Hold the apple in your      hand thumb against the stem, and with a light upward and      sideways motion, twist it off. Be careful not to injure the      spur on which the apple grew, since it will bear again next      year. Also, don't twist the stem out of an apple you want      to store . . . this would break open the skin to      decay-causing bacteria.    </p>    <p>      You can't store summer apples, only fall and winter ones.      However, there's no need to get a bellyache harvesting      them. The cooking varieties make great applesauce and apple      butter to raid the pantry shelves for later.    </p>    <h3>cherries</h3>    <p>      Cherries come in two types, sweet and sour. Sour cherries      aren't often seen in the city, but they can't be beat for      preserves, jam, pies, and the like. They are also hardier      than the sweet varieties.    </p>    <p>      In general, cherries will do well under the same climatic      conditions as apples. They are not as frost-fussy as      apricots or peaches . . . in fact, they are one of the      easiest stone fruits to grow, particularly the sour      cherries. The best way to find out how they will do in your      region is to check with the county agent and local      orchards. Sour cherries begin to bear in their fourth or      fifth year, sweet cherries two years later.    </p>    <p><strong>STOCK</strong></p>    <p>      Not only should you get both sweet and sour cherries, where      possible, but you will probably have to get several      varieties of the sweet. The really tasty ones like Bing and      Napoleon are self-sterile and inter-sterile as well. That      is, not only can't these trees fertilize their own flowers,      even a neighboring tree of the same variety can't do it.      They need Black Tartarians or other fertilizers around. To      boot, the two "mates" have to bloom at the same time.      Consult with a local nurseryman. This is nothing to try to      coordinate through a mail-order house. If there's no      nurseryman handy, make sure the trees you choose are      double-bearing. These bear two different kinds of cherries      at the same time. They have had a branch from a different      species grafted to their trunk as a pollinating pal while      still young stock.    </p>    <p>      A cherry tree, double-bearing or otherwise, will come      grafted to rootstock better adjusted to supporting a yield      than its original roots were. The two common rootstocks for      grafting are mazzard and mahaleb. They are both wild cherry      stocks, hardier than the superbred domestic ones. Mazzard      stock is particularly good if you can get it. It is also      more expensive, but in a long-range project like an orchard      a little more money is well invested. Mahaleb-grafted      cherries bear a year earlier, which often makes them the      more popular. But the overall yield will probably be less.    </p>    <p>      Two-year-old grafted trees-the age is measured from      the time of grafting-with the beginning of a      well-spaced lateral branch system are the ones to buy. Fall      planting is best for them. Mulch well for winter      protection.    </p>		<p><strong>PRUNING</strong></p>    <p>      Like all fruit trees, cherry trees are pruned with the      long-range intent of shaping them for easier picking and      bigger yields. This means a tree open enough to permit      light penetration. But sweet cherry trees naturally grow      tall and upright. And you're working with nature . . . you      can't change her too much and still expect cooperation.      Therefore your sweet cherries will have to be pruned into      taller trees than your sour ones.    </p>    <p>      Prune so that four or five branches off the main trunk      become the primary bearing limbs of a cherry tree. They      should leave the tree at a wide angle. The single top      growing straight up is your leader. Leave it alone. But      trim all other branches so they are shorter than the      leader.    </p>    <p>      In deciding which branches to prune off, look for ones that      point sharply upward. Also, you won't want the remaining      branches to be too close together or all on one side.      Mentally blow the tree up to climbing size. Could you climb      it comfortably? A tree pruned for good climbing is a tree      that will bear well. A good treehouse-tree, on the other      hand, one that has three or four branches all coming out at      the same spot up the trunk, is less apt to be a      high-yielding tree.    </p>    <p>      Major pruning for shape need be done only once. Usually      it's done when the tree is first planted, since this forces      good root development. Maintenance pruning after that      consists only of trimming out cross-branches that rub      together, dead or sickly branches, and those that make a      tree lopsided, filling out too much in one direction.      Overall, up to ten major branches may be allowed to develop      over the years.    </p>    <p><strong>PROBLEMS</strong></p>    <p>      Sour cherries are more disease-resistant than the sweet      type . . . which is why you'll rarely find a sweet wild      cherry. One pest to which they are both prey, however, is      the tent caterpillar. If tent caterpillars strike, you have      two alternatives. Let them be, and they'll eat every leaf      in sight, multiply happily, kill the tree, and after      several years decrease in numbers for lack of food. Or      harvest the caterpillars as soon as you spot them. If you      can manage to keep the population down, the cycle won't      have a chance to start spiraling, and eventually they will      disappear. If harvesting tent caterpillars is not your idea      of how to spend a sunny Sunday, get some praying mantises      to give you a hand.    </p>    <p>      You will occasionally find worms in your cherries. How you      feel about the changing times and the "new squeamishness"      will determine how you feel about the worms. My grandmother      used to deal with worms in preserving cherries simply by      going ahead and canning them. When you opened a jar of the      incredibly tasty compote, you simply skimmed the worms off      the top in the kitchen before ladling the plumblack      cherries into the Limoges dishes for presentation in the      dining room. The worms had been boiled out and were as      neatly preserved as the cherries. Now I'd have to admit      that finding worms in a can of commercial preserves these      days would upset me a little, but not nearly as much as the      DDT and additives in it that I don't see.    </p>    <p>      A final problem with cherry trees is birds. This one you're      not going to avoid "noways, nohow". You'll begin to think      you're running an aviary instead of an orchard. So you do      one of two things. Either you generously plant enough extra      trees to feed the birds too, including some mulberries,      which they like best of all, or you cover the trees with      bird netting. Myself, I prefer birds to ghostly draped      trees that vaguely hint of nature gone away on vacation.      Commercial orchards employ an automatic cannon that goes      off with an explosive bang-but no      ammunition-scaring the birds away. Again personally,      I can think of better ways to spend my time in the country      than being surrounded by cannon fire.    </p>    <p><strong>HARVESTING</strong></p>    <p>      The biggest harvesting problem with cherries is avoiding a      bellyache. If you work on the one-for-yourself,      three-for-the-basket principle, you might survive. Pick      fruit for eating without stems. They won't keep as long,      but it's less of a strain on the tree. Fruit for storage or      sale should be picked with the stems. Use a light,      twisting, upward movement to separate the stem from the      spur. Be careful not to injure or break the spur . . . it's      the source of your future fruit.    </p>    <h3>peaches</h3>    <p>      Peaches present the paradox that they'll grow in almost any      part of the country, but can be grown well in very few.      Still, the smallest peach from your own tree will be      tastier than most store-bought ones, even though peaches      ship better than many fruits.    </p>    <p>      The peach needs both cold (below 40Â°F.) and warmth.      Without a winter cold snap, the trees skip their dormant      period and become too exhausted to bear. On the other hand,      the early-flowering buds are very cold-sensitive. One frost      and you're wiped out. And without summer warmth the fruit      will not mature. Even so, the geographical range for      homegrown peaches is almost nationwide, so try a few trees      if at all possible.    </p>    <p><strong>STOCK</strong></p>    <p>      Since peach trees are so widespread but variable in      adaptation, it's important to get stock suitable for your      region. There are literally thousands of varieties, and      although there is none best suited for downtown San      Francisco or mid-Manhattan, there is a variety best for      your farm. The trees are for the most part      self-pollinating. But it's never a good idea to have less      than two or three trees of any given fruit.    </p>    <p>      You'll get your first peaches after three or four years . .      . the big yields will take another three. At that stage of      the game you can count on four bushels per healthy tree.      Spring planting is the best. A sandy or gravelly loam is      preferred. Use a northern slope to delay blossoming if      you're in an area of late frost.    </p>    <p><strong>PRUNING</strong></p>    <p>      Prepare to butcher your peach tree when you plant it.      Peaches don't take too well to transplanting, so you will      have to cut back the tops severely in order to encourage      root development. Trim the leader back almost a third of      the total plant height, making sure to cut just above a      branch. The new leader will emerge from the junction and      you don't want dead wood above it. Prune all the branches      back to one and two-inch stubs. The effect you want is a      spiked miniflagpole. From the stubs eliminate all but three      or four of the new buds that appear in the summertime. The      object of the game is to develop a tree with three or four      main branches rising together . . . in other words, a      treehouse tree rather than a climbing one.    </p>    <p>      Regular spring maintenance pruning is the same as for other      trees. Get rid of dead branches and shape the tree to be      open and without crisscrossing branches. Also, when the      tree begins to bear, you will have to thin out fruit      growing too close together. One peach to every four or five      inches of branch is plenty for it to bear. Even so, if a      mature tree lets its branches droop heavily with fruit, you      may have to support the branches with braces. Peach trees      are prone to natural pruning, that is, branches break off      from the weight of too much fruit.    </p>    <p><strong>PROBLEMS</strong></p>    <p>      Most peach tree problems will not strike a healthy tree.      And those that are serious enough to destroy the tree won't      be stopped by all the chemicals or anything else around,      unless you kill the tree first anyhow. So sit back and let      nature take its course. Fertilize your trees with      nitrogen-rich compost in early spring to boost plant      growth. Mulch the orchard, but keep the mulch at least two      feet from the trunks to minimize peach tree borers. Prune      away dead branches and those with injured bark, and pick      off any strange bugs or their nests that you spot.    </p>    <p><strong>HARVESTING</strong></p>    <p>      Pick peaches when soft enough to give slightly under light      thumb pressure. You've squeezed peaches at your local      green-grocer's. Same principle, different fruit . . . the      ones you pick ripe off the tree are much more nourishing.      Twist fruit up and out as with others.    </p>    <p>      Peaches not fully ripe can be picked for storage if the      season is running out on you, but be sure not to bruise      them. Even gently harvested, they won't store for more than      three or four weeks in a cool cellar. Make jam of the      extras . . . peach jam rivals apricot for sheer      lusciousness.    </p>    <h3>pears</h3>    <p>      Pears, like peaches, need to be winter-chilled. In general,      they can be grown in the same regions as apples and      peaches. They are hardier than peaches, but they flower      earlier than apple trees, so watch for chills. Areas of      consistent zero-degree winters are about the northern-most      limit for pear trees, and with such temperatures      winter-killing of the buds may occur.    </p>    <p>      Pear trees do well on poorer soil as long as it's well      drained. In fact, very rich soil will produce overly lush      growth, which in turn will encourage fire blight. Like      Cassius, they should have a lean and hungry look.    </p>   <p><strong>STOCK</strong></p>    <p>      Self-sterile for the most part, pear trees are best ordered      in different varieties if you want to be on the safe side,      in which case they'll also need to be same-time bloomers.      Buy one-yearold grafted whips around five feet tall. These      should be about one-half- to three-quarters-inch thick,      with smooth, even bark. Plant in early spring, on a      northern slope where possible to protect them from      premature flowering and a too-hot summer sun. Prune back      about 25 percent on planting and don't use a fertilizer      rich in nitrogen . . . this is one tree you don't want to      grow very fast.    </p>    <p><strong>PRUNING</strong></p>    <p>      A minimum-pruning tree. After the initial planting trim,      help shape it and remove root suckers when they form, but      never give it a heavy pruning to boost growth. It would      respond too well, and fire blight would follow only too      often. Also very rapid growth makes the tree literally jump      out of its skin . . . the bark splits, inviting borers and      a multitude of other nuisances.    </p>   <p><strong> PROBLEMS</strong></p>    <p>      The main thing you have to worry about with pear trees is      fire blight, and it may be hard to avoid in the healthiest      of trees. Fire blight derives its name from the fact that      the affected parts look as if someone had gone over them      with a blowtorch while you weren't looking. It can strike      all parts of the tree from flowers to main trunk, but not      at the same time. This is your key to keeping pear      production going. Trim off any blighted area as soon as you      see it. Branches should be removed with a foot of healthy      wood behind them. Don't handle the affected part and then      the rest of the tree . . . would you blow your nose in      someone else's old handkerchief? Keep all infected      trimmings away from the tree trunk while you work, and burn      them in a hot fire away from the orchard. The worst blight      season is from bloom till fruit . . . this is the time to      keep a sharp lookout for the culprit.    </p>    <p><strong>HARVESTING</strong></p>    <p>      Some pears must be harvested before they are ripe or they      turn gravelly. The only way to find out if your variety      falls into this category is to pick some when they are      mature in size but just beginning to turn color, letting      the others ripen on the tree. Compare quality. Next year      you'll know. Pears picked just before the first blush of      color can be cold-stored for two to three months or more.    </p>   <h3>plums</h3>    <p>      Like most other temperate fruit, plums need to be      winter-chilled in order to bear. They can be grown in just      about any part of the United States where winter      temperatures fall below 40Â°F. for a few weeks but not      below-25Â°F. for the same period of time.    </p>    <p>      As usual, select a locally adapted variety, bearing in mind      that prune plums will be needed if you want to make a lot      of prunes. Regular plums can be dried too, but they have to      be pitted and halved . . . their sugar content is not high      enough to preserve them without fermentation.    </p>   <p><strong> STOCK</strong></p>    <p>      You will need at least two varieties, since most plums are      self-sterile. All plums are root-grafted, which means on a      one-year-old tree you'll be getting solid two- or      three-year-old rootstock. Plant in fall if the winters in      your area are mild enough so that temperatures do not go      below the teens except on very rare occasions. Spring      planting is fine as long as the tree is completely dormant,      but fall planting is better where possible.    </p>    <p>      Space the trees fifteen to thirty feet apart, depending on      the mature size of your particular species. Plum bark is      sensitive to sun-scald (to a tree what a sunburn is to      people), so wrap a couple of layers of burlap around the      lower part of the trunk. Cut the wood back by 25 percent      when you plant.    </p>   <p><strong> PRUNING</strong></p>    <p>      Pruning is mostly confine to shaping a wide, open,      spreading tree, and, of course, regular maintenance      trimming. Once fruiting begins, you may have to support      some of the bearing branches like those of your peach      trees. Eliminating overbearing by selectively removing      small, unripe fruit will also be necessary. Keep all      pruning cuts clean and, if possible, seal them over with      pitch to protect against heart rot.    </p>   <p><strong>PROBLEMS</strong></p>    <p>      As with cherries, birds can be a menace. Try a mulberry      hedge around your orchard. Birds simply love mulberries,      and they will often stop at the hedge and fill themselves      up before they ever reach your fruit.    </p>    <p><strong>HARVESTING</strong></p>    <p>      Harvest plums when fully ripe for eating, just a little      before for canning. Prune varieties should be allowed to      ripen till they drop . . . into a cheesecloth trampoline      you have suspended beneath the tree. Remove fallen fruit      daily and sun-dry on screen trays, turning occasionally. If      it's rainy, oven-dry in single layers for six hours at      110Â° F.    </p>
