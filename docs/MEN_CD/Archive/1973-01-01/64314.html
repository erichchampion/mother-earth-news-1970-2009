                      <h5 id="byline">By BOB DOOLITTLE</h5>  <p>      <em>Everything the Power of the World does is done- in a      circle.... Our teepees were round like the- nests of birds,      and these were always set in a circle... But the Wasichus      [Whites] have put us in these square boxes. Our power is      gone and we are dying....</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Black Elk Speaks , p. 199-200</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And they shall not build and another inhabit; they      shall not plant and another eat: for as the days of a tree      are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy      the work of their hands.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Isaiah , 65:22</em>    </p>    <p>      We figure it took two 40-man-hour weeks to build a nd cost      us a total of $25 . . . and the pleasure of living in a      round house that we put together with our own hands has      verified Black Elk and Isaiah's thoughts beyond words.      Still, in words, we <em>can</em> lay out the recipe we      followed . . . just in case you want to construct such a      residence for yourself.    </p>    <p>      Our first step was to pick a spot, put in a stake      and-with a 10-foot-long string attached to the      post-draw a circle on the ground. (That's a 63-foot      circumference . . . we wanted some room. Even this      beginning step was simpler and quicker than measuring and      squaring the normal rectangle.    </p>        <p>      Next we cut eight poles about four inches in diameter eight      feet long and planted them upright (in holes 20 inches      deep) at equal intervals around the circle. By tamping      solidly as we filled dirt and stones back in around the      poles, we managed to make the uprights fairly stable. At      that stage, the house made us think of Stonehenge.    </p>    <p>      It also made us think of the roof we'd soon be resting on      the uprights . . . a roof that would push down and      <em>out</em> . How would we contain that outward pressure?      Rafters? Buttresses?    </p>    <p>      The answer was so simple and so round . . . we bound the      whole ring of poles near their tops with wire. Baling wire      or even heavy twine would have done the job, but we had      barbed wire from the dump for free and we strung it up . .      . five times around in a tight circle.    </p>        <p>      <br />      <br />    </p>            <p>      Then we notched the tops of the uprights, collected eight      more longer and thinner (12 feet by three inches in      diameter) poles and notched the out-end of each to fit the      uprights as shown.    </p>    <p>      A pyramid of bales (later used as building blocks) held the      roof supports-and us-while we set, nailed and      wired the poles in place.    </p>        <p>      The center-ends of the roof timbers were then nailed and      wirebound together in a superimposed two-sets-of-four      pattern that had a hole in its center for a stovepipe to      stick through.    </p>        <p>      By that time we were really high. We hadn't known for sure.      we <em>could</em> build anything when we started . . . and      here our pole frame was, already starting to took like a      house. We were meeting and enjoying the special problems of      round form, too: instead of walls and square corners and      parallel lines, it was a new world of curves and cones and      diameters and centers.    </p>        <p>      <br />    </p>    <p>      The next step-putting up the wall-was even more      exciting!    </p>    <p>      We had bought and hauled in two pickup loads of straw . . .      90 bales for $21.00. Each bale, turned on edge, was 1-1/2      feet high . . . which meant that a stack of four would give      us a wall six feet tall.    </p>    <p>      It was easy to make the oversized "bricks" of straw fit the      circumference of our circle: we just leaned each bale      against another and bent it by jumping on it to make it      sag.    </p>        <p>      As each tier of our four-layered wall was completed, we      bound the circle of bales tightly into each other and into      the frame with a band of twine.    </p>        <p>      To stagger the bundles of straw like brickwork meant using      a half bale at one end of each layer. We made these      pint-sized building blocks by driving a stake (with new      twine tied to it)    </p>        <p>      through the middle of a still-uncut full-sized bale. Out      came the stake on the other side-like a threaded      needle-making it easy for us to tie up the first of      the two "shorties" we got from every bale we split.    </p>    <p>      We left an opening the width of the door in each of the      layers and-in the third tier-we left gaps the      width of the windows we'd found (for free, again in the      dump). We made supports for the top layer of bales by      laying boards over the window openings.    </p>        <p>      Then we laid a covering of hog wire over the roof supports      and attached its ends to the barbed wire with which we had      circled the tops of the wall poles. Over the hog wire, we      spread an inch of loose straw <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: Hey, Bob,      why not a thicker layer of roofing straw for more      insulation?) . . .</em> and over the straw we nailed a      corrugated tin roof that overhung the building's wall. As a      final touch, we spotted the nail holes in the corrugated      metal with tar.    </p>            <p>      Even with all the climbing and hammering and heavy      material, the roof poles held up well. The metal sheets,      however, were hard to work with, hard to cut and hard to      clamber around on as we guessed where to nail in order to      hit a pole. Next time I'll use three-foot-wide strips of      plastic, overlapped like long shingles to make the water      run off. The plastic is lighter and (if you have to buy the      tin) cheaper.    </p>    <p>      Just for fun as we began to top our new home, it began to      snow. By that time, my hands were also beginning to show my      inexperience (each day added a new scratch or cut, mainly      from the barbed wire and tin). The excitement of      construction, however, had made us stronger than any mere      cold weather or small wounds. Our city selves no longer      shrank from such challenges. We felt quite able to      meet-and beat-the worst we encountered.    </p>        <p>      <br />    </p>        <p>      Once the roof was on, it was time to set the windows into      the pre-fitted openings we had left for them. We supported      each frame on little one-inch-thick poles set into the      ground inside the house at the appropriate locations. Then      we attached wires to a screw in each corner of every window      frame, pulled the strands out between the bales around the      openings, drew the frames snug against the wall and cinched      the wires to sticks on the outside.    </p>    <p>      For the door frame, we set two more poles about two feet      into the dirt, just like the original eight uprights      (working right on the ground is so simple and      straightforward). We nailed a short 2 X 4 across the top of      the two vertical members to complete the frame and a strip      of cardboard (like a long hinge) over the real hinges to      weatherproof one side of the door. After a little shaving,      the door neatly closed into the other framing pole and a      nail-beheaded, bent info a "U" and hammered into the      upright-was all the latch-catch we needed.<br />    </p>        <p>      At that point, the only drafts we felt came from odd chinks      in the wall and from between the wall and the roof. These      cracks we stuffed with straw . . . until the air inside the      house was perfectly still. The floor, still strewn with      straw from our work, was so pleasant to walk on that we      decided to leave it that way.    </p>    <p>      Then-great moment!-we brought in the stove and      placed it in the center of the lodge on a little raised      platform of dirt inside a circle of rocks (to keep the fire      away from the straw).    </p>    <p>      To protect the roof poles from the heat of the stovepipe,      we wrapped each timber at its center-end in a little jacket      of asbestos and put a layer of aluminum foil around the      pipe where it went through the ceiling. Then we stapled a      big piece of asbestos (with a hole in its middle for the      pipe to pass through) to the underside of the roof to cut      heat loss.    </p>        <p>      And that was it. Except for the fact that we're so into      straw that we've kept several bales as furniture.    </p>    <p>      When you walk into our house the floors, wall, roof and all      are the golden color of a wheat field. The round floor plan      so of embraces you and the eye moves unhindered around is      one continuous wall. The total effect-if you'll      pardon my bias-is most relaxing.    </p>    <p>      If you build a lodge like ours, do write and tell me about      it.    </p>    <p>      <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: Bob Doolittle's current address is      W1653 Water Avenue, Spokane, Washington 99201. He'll      probably get a lot of letters as a result of this article,      so remember to send along a stamped, self-addressed      envelope if you expect a reply).</em>    </p>
