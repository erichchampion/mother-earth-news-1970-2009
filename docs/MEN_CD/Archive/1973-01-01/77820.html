    <p>
            			    <p>      Cherries come in two types, sweet and sour. Sour cherries      aren't often seen in the city, but they can't be beat for      preserves, jam, pies, and the like. They are also hardier      than the sweet varieties.    </p>    <p>      In general, cherries will do well under the same climatic      conditions as apples. They are not as frost-fussy as      apricots or peaches . . . in fact, they are one of the      easiest stone fruits to grow, particularly the sour      cherries. The best way to find out how they will do in your      region is to check with the county agent and local      orchards. Sour cherries begin to bear in their fourth or      fifth year, sweet cherries two years later.    </p>    <h3>STOCK</h3>    <p>      Not only should you get both sweet and sour cherries, where      possible, but you will probably have to get several      varieties of the sweet. The really tasty ones like Bing and      Napoleon are self-sterile and inter-sterile as well. That      is, not only can't these trees fertilize their own flowers,      even a neighboring tree of the same variety can't do it.      They need Black Tartarians or other fertilizers around. To      boot, the two "mates" have to bloom at the same time.      Consult with a local nurseryman. This is nothing to try to      coordinate through a mail-order house. If there's no      nurseryman handy, make sure the trees you choose are      double-bearing. These bear two different kinds of cherries      at the same time. They have had a branch from a different      species grafted to their trunk as a pollinating pal while      still young stock.    </p>    <p>      A cherry tree, double-bearing or otherwise, will come      grafted to rootstock better adjusted to supporting a yield      than its original roots were. The two common rootstocks for      grafting are mazzard and mahaleb. They are both wild cherry      stocks, hardier than the superbred domestic ones. Mazzard      stock is particularly good if you can get it. It is also      more expensive, but in a long-range project like an orchard      a little more money is well invested. Mahaleb-grafted      cherries bear a year earlier, which often makes them the      more popular. But the overall yield will probably be less.    </p>    <p>      Two-year-old grafted trees-the age is measured from      the time of grafting-with the beginning of a      well-spaced lateral branch system are the ones to buy. Fall      planting is best for them. Mulch well for winter      protection.    </p>		<h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      Like all fruit trees, cherry trees are pruned with the      long-range intent of shaping them for easier picking and      bigger yields. This means a tree open enough to permit      light penetration. But sweet cherry trees naturally grow      tall and upright. And you're working with nature . . . you      can't change her too much and still expect cooperation.      Therefore your sweet cherries will have to be pruned into      taller trees than your sour ones.    </p>    <p>      Prune so that four or five branches off the main trunk      become the primary bearing limbs of a cherry tree. They      should leave the tree at a wide angle. The single top      growing straight up is your leader. Leave it alone. But      trim all other branches so they are shorter than the      leader.    </p>    <p>      In deciding which branches to prune off, look for ones that      point sharply upward. Also, you won't want the remaining      branches to be too close together or all on one side.      Mentally blow the tree up to climbing size. Could you climb      it comfortably? A tree pruned for good climbing is a tree      that will bear well. A good treehouse-tree, on the other      hand, one that has three or four branches all coming out at      the same spot up the trunk, is less apt to be a      high-yielding tree.    </p>    <p>      Major pruning for shape need be done only once. Usually      it's done when the tree is first planted, since this forces      good root development. Maintenance pruning after that      consists only of trimming out cross-branches that rub      together, dead or sickly branches, and those that make a      tree lopsided, filling out too much in one direction.      Overall, up to ten major branches may be allowed to develop      over the years.    </p>   <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      Sour cherries are more disease-resistant than the sweet      type . . . which is why you'll rarely find a sweet wild      cherry. One pest to which they are both prey, however, is      the tent caterpillar. If tent caterpillars strike, you have      two alternatives. Let them be, and they'll eat every leaf      in sight, multiply happily, kill the tree, and after      several years decrease in numbers for lack of food. Or      harvest the caterpillars as soon as you spot them. If you      can manage to keep the population down, the cycle won't      have a chance to start spiraling, and eventually they will      disappear. If harvesting tent caterpillars is not your idea      of how to spend a sunny Sunday, get some praying mantises      to give you a hand.    </p>    <p>      You will occasionally find worms in your cherries. How you      feel about the changing times and the "new squeamishness"      will determine how you feel about the worms. My grandmother      used to deal with worms in preserving cherries simply by      going ahead and canning them. When you opened a jar of the      incredibly tasty compote, you simply skimmed the worms off      the top in the kitchen before ladling the plumblack      cherries into the Limoges dishes for presentation in the      dining room. The worms had been boiled out and were as      neatly preserved as the cherries. Now I'd have to admit      that finding worms in a can of commercial preserves these      days would upset me a little, but not nearly as much as the      DDT and additives in it that I don't see.    </p>    <p>      A final problem with cherry trees is birds. This one you're      not going to avoid "noways, nohow". You'll begin to think      you're running an aviary instead of an orchard. So you do      one of two things. Either you generously plant enough extra      trees to feed the birds too, including some mulberries,      which they like best of all, or you cover the trees with      bird netting. Myself, I prefer birds to ghostly draped      trees that vaguely hint of nature gone away on vacation.      Commercial orchards employ an automatic cannon that goes      off with an explosive bang-but no      ammunition-scaring the birds away. Again personally,      I can think of better ways to spend my time in the country      than being surrounded by cannon fire.    </p>    <h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      The biggest harvesting problem with cherries is avoiding a      bellyache. If you work on the one-for-yourself,      three-for-the-basket principle, you might survive. Pick      fruit for eating without stems. They won't keep as long,      but it's less of a strain on the tree. Fruit for storage or      sale should be picked with the stems. Use a light,      twisting, upward movement to separate the stem from the      spur. Be careful not to injure or break the spur . . . it's      the source of your future fruit.    </p>
