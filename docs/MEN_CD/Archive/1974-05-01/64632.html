                <h5 id="byline">      by MICHAEL HACKLEMAN:			</h5>					    <p>      Here are a few comments and corrections pertaining to my      article "The Savonius Super Rotor!" in MOTHER NO. 26.[1] In      case you were wondering, that's not me with the shirt off      in that picture on page 78 . . . that's David House      (resident and founder of Earthmind and author of the book      <em>Methane Systems</em> ), as photographed late in      November. Yep, it were cold, but then we are real hardy      folk, too.    </p>    <p>      [2] My comparison of the Stuart mill and the S-rotor      omitted any mention of feathering: twisting of a      conventional windplant's propeller blades to lower the      device's rotational speed in high winds. <em>(See the      Plowboy Interview in MOTHER VO. 24 for a discussion of the      subject-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Feathering is a necessary precaution in wind-charger design      for a number of reasons. First-whenever a fixed gear      ratio is used-some such governing arrangement is needed to      prevent the alternator/generator from exceeding its maximum      rated output (current). In a propeller-driven unit,      however, the prop itself is a factor in determining at what      windspeed feathering must occur. The problems involved may      be described in terms of balance, structural design and      blade tip stresses.    </p>    <p>      [a] Balance-as I mentioned in my article-is      always more important (or critical) at higher rotational      speeds than at lower rpm's. If a propeller is allowed to      exceed its "operating range", therefore, dangerous      vibrations can be set up.    </p>    <p>      [b] The structural design of a propeller, and the materials      of which it's made, also determine the device's upper      rotational speed beyond which centrifugal force will pull      it apart.    </p>    <p>      [c] Tip stresses occur at higher windspeeds . . . but are      rather independent of whether or not the propeller is      turning. This is one reason why "braking" a fan to a stop      in a tempest won't help it very much.    </p>    <p>      All these problems of propeller-driven units are irrelevant      to the S-rotor. Since the Savonius device never achieves      high rotational speed, balancing is not critical and      centrifugal force won't pull the installation apart. In      addition, a runaway S-rotor will soon begin to spoil itself      because its own wings get in one another's way at higher      rpm's.    </p>    <p>      [3] I'd like to recommend an additional source of      information on battery maintenance: A good booklet entitled      <em>The Storage Battery (Lead-Acid): Fundamental      Principles, Operation, and Care</em> is available for $1.00      from Exide Power Systems, ESB Inc., Philadelphia,      Pennsylvania 19120.    </p>    <p>      [4] The table on page 80 contains a number of errors.      First, the figures are for an <em>11 mph</em> average      annual windspeed . . . not 8 mph, as I indicated. Second,      the column heading "Normal output (in watts)" should have      read " <em>Maximum</em> normal output in watts", since the      data represent highest wind situations.    </p>    <p>      The following revised chart is a more accurate indication      of output at various windspeeds. Note that this information      is correct only if the generator-or array of      generators-is capable of delivering the higher      wattages.    </p>    <p>      [5] Reminder: A collection of detailed material on the      construction and operation of a low-cost S-rotor may be      ordered from Earthmind, 26510 Josel Drive, Saugus,      California 91350. (A paper on our testing program for      lead-acid batteries is also available and will be included      on request.) The cost of the package is $7.50 . . . please      make all checks and money orders payable to Earthmind. And      remember, we'll refund $3.00 of that amount to any buyer      who returns to us a photo and description of his completed      Savonius unit.    </p>    <p>      Please note, though, that we've lost a couple of people      here at Earthmind and are postponing research on the      S-rotor unit that uses up to four alternators. The plans      we're selling are for a wind-machine hooked up to      <em>one</em> alternator, and the plant's output is      therefore determined solely by its rating (i.e., a 60-amp      unit will deliver only 720 watts, a 130-amp unit only      1,500). If you were thinking of writing us about the      multialternator system-or have already done so-we may      not be able to answer your questions at this time. As a      purchaser of our plans, however, you automatically      subscribe to a newsletter we'll send out when we've      developed the design (we're calling it Windspinner I).    </p>    <p>      We're also working on improved "wings", and our information      package includes instructions for an alternative model      which allows interchange of the wind-catching mechanism      without lowering the entire assembly . . . for the benefit      of folks who wish to upgrade their machines when the new      information becomes available.    </p>    <p>      One last word: There's a lot happening at Earthmind apart      from the S-rotor project. Send us a stamped, self-addressed      envelope if you'd like to see our list of publications.    </p>
