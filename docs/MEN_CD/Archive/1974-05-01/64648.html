    <p>
        			        <p>      Dr. Ralph Borsodi (see the Plowboy Interview in MOTHER NO.      26) is chiefly famous for his successful experiments in      self-sufficient living. There's another side to the man,      however, that is of increasing importance in this time of      runaway prices: his long-term interest in inflation, its      causes and cures.    </p>    <p>      To be downright blunt about it, Borsodi does not believe      that a steadily shrinking dollar (or yen or mark or franc      or whatever) is quite the "accident" that politicians      usually make it out to be. Quite the contrary. In his view,      governments cynically and stupidly debase the purchasing      power of their currencies <em>on purpose</em> by printing      too much paper money. Why? Because modern politicians and      the economists who advise them are-in the      main-rather weak-willed animals who lack either the      power or the fortitude to run a country on a strictly      pay-as-we-go basis.    </p>    <p>      "It wasn't always this way," Borsodi points out. "During      most of the last century, the majority of economists      preferred gold and silver or currencies that were solidly      backed-unit for unit-by such real wealth. The      prevailing doctrine among those economists was that the      worst possible kind of money was 'printing press' money . .      . currency backed by nothing except the word of the      government which issued it. They called this <em>fiat</em>      money. They didn't have much regard for it.    </p>    <p>      "All right. Along came John Maynard Keynes. He was a very      influential economist in England from about 1915 to 1946      and he invented the idea that we can insure prosperity by      'controlled inflation'.    </p>    <p>      "Keynes' theory, you see, is that a government can steadily      expand a country's economy, even during periods of what      would otherwise be a recession or depression, by pumping a      little 'extra' money-a little printing press      currency-into circulation.    </p>    <p>      "Now Keynes knew that this would dilute the purchasing      power of every unit of money already in circulation. If you      have more units of money trying to buy the same amount of      goods and services, you know, prices inevitably go up. You      have inflation.    </p>    <p>      "Keynes was willing to accept this debasement of currency,      however, because he thought that a government could inflate      its currency just a little bit and just once. Then, as the      Good Times began to roll in that country once more, the      government could stop pumping the extra units of money into      the nation's economy.    </p>    <p>      "Well that was a nice thought, but politicians don't seem      to work that way. Planned inflation is just like planned      drug taking. It doesn't work. You always need a bigger      'fix' the next time around. Politicians have <em>never</em>      stopped inflating a country's currency once they've begun.      Quite the contrary. They just keep on giving a nation's      money supply a bigger and bigger shot in the arm until the      whole situation runs away with itself. And that's what's      happening on a global scale right now."    </p>    <p>      Borsodi traces the planet's current financial problems to      the International Monetary Conference held in Bretton      Woods, New Hampshire in July of 1944. Keynes' inflationary      philosophy was adopted on an international scale at that      meeting and, as a result, is universally accepted by heads      of state and their advisors today. Dr. Borsodi, on the      other hand, was not impressed by the idea then and he      remains unimpressed by it now.    </p>    <p>      "I like what I call 'rational systems of money'. I liked      then in 1944 and I still like them today. Fiat money is not      rational and Keynes' philosophy of economic growth can lead      only to fiat currency."    </p>    <p>      The Bretton Woods conference disturbed Dr. Borsodi so      deeply that he soon wrote a small paperback in which lie      prophesied what are substantially the economic problems      that we're experiencing right now. The booklet, published      in 1948 by The School of Living, was titled <em>Inflation      is Coming and What to Do About It.</em> Despite the fact      that the publication sold nearly half a million copies,      however, few individuals in positions of power seem to have      read it or to have heeded Borsodi's warnings.    </p>    <p>      And so we find nearly every nation in the world frantically      trying to run <em>up</em> . . . an increasingly rapid down      escalator of debased currency. It costs more and more every      day, in other words, <em>just to stay</em> <em>even</em>      than it did the day before. During the 28 years from 1945      to 1973, the value of the United States dollar depreciated      by a good two-thirds . . . and a 1974 dollar has shrunk an      additional 10%. And there's no end to the madness in sight.      "If we continue this foolishness," says Borsodi, "we're      eventually going to witness a debacle followed by a      depression worse than that of the 1930's."    </p>    <p>      Dr. Borsodi was more or less content to write and talk      about the problem until the U.S. dollar was devalued in      1971. He and his wife were visiting a health resort in      southern California at the time and Borsodi was researching      a book in the Escondido library when he picked up a      newspaper and read of the devaluation. The book was      forgotten. Borsodi says, "I began to wonder what would      happen if, instead of writing another book about inflation,      I were to try to issue a currency that would be      inflation-free."    </p>    <p>      When he returned to his Exeter, New Hampshire home, Borsodi      began discussing his idea with the officers of all the      banks in town. He also wrote to the head of the Federal      Reserve System and talked for hours with Federal Reserve      representatives in Boston. Borsodi was very open about what      he intended to do and he took the stand that, while the      United States Constitution forbids the counterfeiting of      this nation's currency, it in no way limits the minting or      circulation of a completely alternative medium of exchange.    </p>    <p>      Although no one particularly agreed with Dr. Borsodi, no      one disagreed with him either. He now says, "I think they      probably said to themselves something like, 'Oh well, let      the old man go ahead. He can't do anything much up there in      Exeter.' I think this is the attitude they probably took      toward the whole affair."    </p>    <p>      And go ahead he did. Borsodi figured that if it was a good      idea to back a currency with gold and silver, it'd be an      even better idea to back it with a whole market basket of      commodities.    </p>    <p>      That is, if certificates were printed and distributed with      the guarantee that they'd always be 100% redeemable in      fixed amounts of, say, 30 of the world's most widely used      resources . . . those certificates would automatically      increase in value as the value of the resources increased      (in terms of constantly degraded national currencies).      Whereas a dollar will now buy less than one-third as much      gold or wheat or silver or iron or tin or cotton or copra      as it bought in 1945 . . . such a certificate (which is      issued with the guarantee that it will always be      exchangeable for a <em>fixed</em> amount of all these      goods) will, by definition, perpetually buy the same amount      of gold or wheat or silver or iron or tin or cotton or      copra. Year after year after year after year.    </p>    <p>      By issuing a certificate firmly based on <em>real      wealth</em> , in other words-instead of politicians'      empty promises-Borsodi thought he could create a      medium of exchange that would be inflation-proof . . . or      "constant". And he decided to call his new currency just      that . . . the <em>constant.</em>    </p>    <p>      Does the idea work? Well, Borsodi presented his thoughts to      a number of people who-over a period of about three      years-have "deposited" a total of approximately      $100,000 in something called the Arbitrage International      "bank". (Deposits and withdrawals can be made by an      individual at any time just as if he or she were dealing      with a real bank, and all monies are fully protected by the      Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.) The funds, in turn,      have been used to buy and sell Borsodi's 30 basic      commodities on the world market.    </p>    <p>      Result: The pioneers in the experiment have seen their      constants rise in value (in relation to the dollar) a      whopping 17% in just three years. Or, to put it the other      way around, a constant bought in 1970 can still be traded      for exactly one constant's worth of goods . . . while a      dollar will now buy only 85% of what it would purchase      three years ago.    </p>    <p>      Borsodi next took his idea one giant step further by      minting something he calls a <em>globe.</em> As Keith      Dewey-a young man who has helped Dr. Borsodi found      his alternative currency-says, "We can't call them      coins because that's against the law and we refuse to call      them medallions so we call them globes. They're the missing      link between absolute barter and trading. They have no      labels on them. No dollar sign or cent sign, and no      constant sign. All it says on a globe is that the piece of      metal contains either one-half ounce or a full ounce of      .999 fine silver. A globe, in other words, is a very      convenient barterable item. You can't keep wheat in your      pocket and you can't keep a fish in your pocket but you      most certainly can keep a globe-which has a real      worth of its own-in your pocket. And that real worth,      by the way, remains constant. No matter what a dollar bill      will buy on any particular day, a globe will always      purchase exactly its weight in silver-and a      corresponding amount of any other commodity-because a      globe <em>is</em> silver."    </p>    <p>      (Interestingly enough, the globe has been worth more than      its weight in silver from the first day the first globe was      minted. On top of its real worth, many people see a certain      collector's value in the "coin" . . . and other individuals      have been pleased to purchase globes at a premium price in      order to help Borsodi finance his new currency. When silver      was selling for $3.25 an ounce, for example, the going rate      for a one-ounce globe was $7.00. Now that silver is priced      at more than $6.00 an ounce, the same "coin" sells for      $10.00. And, of course-in the finest tradition of      barter-the half-ounce or ounce chunks of metal are      also worth exactly what wants, needs or desires make them      worth on any given day . . . as evidenced in the sidebar      that accompanies this article.)    </p>    <p>      So OK. So Dr. Borsodi seems to have accomplished exactly      what he set out to do. So where does he go from here?    </p>    <p>      Now that the initial test of his idea is over, Borsodi (who      is nearing 90) has handed most of the responsibility for      his alternative currency over to younger men . . . who are      in the process of scrapping the prototype setup and      establishing a truly international alternative medium of      exchange.    </p>    <p>      A limited partnership has been formed and is now conducting      experiments to determine the ideal "commodity index" to use      for backing the constant. Until the final selection is      made, constants are temporarily no longer being issued.      (Globes, however, are still available at a price of $10.00      for an ounce piece and $5.00 for a half-ounce strike from      Arbitrage International, Exeter, New Hampshire.)    </p>    <p>      The people currently working on Borsodi's concept hope to      be able to set up a public corporation by fall. At that      time, debentures will be issued by the corporation for      funds received. That is: You will be able to pay dollars or      any other national currency for Arbitrage International      debentures. Your money will then be invested in commodities      or guaranteed contracts for commodities . . . and the goods      will be used to give a stable value to the certificates      (the debentures) you hold. Owners of constants will be able      to redeem their holdings in their own national currency at      any time. Holders of constants will also be able to      exchange those holdings for commodity contracts on which      they can then take delivery, or which they can sell on the      open market for some other national currency.    </p>        <p>      This activity will be coordinated out of a bank which will      be established in Luxembourg (Arbitrage International      already maintains both a Luxembourg and a London office, in      addition to its temporary headquarters in Exeter, New      Hampshire.) If all goes well, it is hoped that the      Luxembourg bank will eventually prove a boon to developing      nations by granting self-liquidating, interest-free loans      to such commodity-exporting (exploited) countries. This      will raise the standard of living in the poorer areas of      the planet and encourage international trade.    </p>    <p>      And it will do one thing more: Give little people the world      over a safe port against the tidal wave of inflation that      threatens to engulf us all.    </p>			<div class="sidebar">    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/027-085-01.jpg" alt="027-085-01.jpg" width="200" height="124" />			    <p class="caption">      And how does the constant work in actual practice? Rick      Perry gives a brief account of the intertwined history of      ...    </p></div>    <h3>      GREEN EARTH, THE LOAF AND<br /> LADLE, THE CONSTANT AND<br />      THE GLOBE    </h3>    <p>      The first thing I knew about the constant was when Dr.      Borsodi came into my shop, the Green Earth natural foods      store on Water Street in Exeter, New Hampshire. Jerry      Rooney and I own it. Dr. Borsodi said, "Would you pass out      these pamphlets about the constant to your customers?"    </p>		<p>And I said, "Sure. What are they? What is <em>it</em>    ?"<br /></p>    <p>      And he said, "Well, it's a new currency." He put it in such      a simple way that I'll never forget. He said, "It's a      currency based on <em>real</em> commodities such as rice      and wheat and cotton and iron."    </p>    <p>      You know, that made <em>sense.</em>    </p>    <p>      Then he said, "This will enable the constant to be stable      because as the prices of these commodities go up, the price      of the constant will likewise go up."    </p>    <p>      And <em>that</em> made a lot of sense.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Borsodi really got me interested. In fact, my wife and      I opened a checking account with Arbitrage International      shortly after that. It was as easy as starting a checking      account with the average bank . . . we filled out the same      kinds of forms, we could make withdrawals in dollars      instead of constants any time we wanted to and our deposit      was fully insured.    </p>    <p>      Green Earth and our restaurant-the Loaf and      Ladle-were two of the first businesses in Exeter      where you could trade in constants.    </p>    <p>      In the Loaf and Ladle I've got a constant and a silver      globe posted up over the cash register. That particular      globe was the first one to ever be taken in barter, which      is its ideal function. One person came into the restaurant      and bought three meals with it. And we went back and forth.      I said, "Let's see, I know silver's worth $3.25 an ounce      today, but I know you paid $7.00 to get that globe, so I'll      give you $5.00 worth of food for it."    </p>    <p>      So he bought $5.00 worth of meals. I did $5.00 because I      knew that if I took it back to Arbitrage International and      told them what I'd done, they'd give me $5.00 for it. And      the constant up there over the cash register is the first      one that anybody spent in the restaurant.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, the Loaf and Ladle might never have      gotten started in the first place if it hadn't been for the      constant. My wife, Kerry, and I wanted to open a good food      restaurant, a place where we could cook food that was good      for people . . . not necessarily organic or natural but      just the best you could get of what we wanted to serve. And      what we wanted to serve was homemade soups and breads and      desserts . . . and salads using a lot of natural things      like sprouts and high-protein combinations.    </p>    <p>      Now I've done a lot of work in restaurants and know the      ropes as far as managing one and getting the equipment and      setting it up and stuff, but nobody thought that a "soup      kitchen" could be successful in this area.    </p>    <p>      Well, in February of '73 we got a loan of $1,500 from      Arbitrage International to get the Loaf and Ladle started.      Now this was before the new currency was actually minted.      It wasn't minted until June of last year. But the Institute      put the money into our checking account in dollars and      then, later on, we paid our loan installments back in      constants. It worked out really great because Dr, Borsodi      wanted somebody to go through that loan phase with his new      currency, and we needed the money . . . so we were actually      helping each other. And the restaurant has been a great      success right from the beginning. It worked out really      well.    </p>    <p>      As far as the alternative money system goes, the constant      is so good that the only thing keeping it from working for      <em>everyone right now</em> is that the government wouldn't      go for it. It defeats the government's whole purpose. They      wouldn't be able to print money any time they wanted to:      they wouldn't be able to manufacture money out of thin air.    </p>    <p>      Rick Perry<br />      Exeter, N.H.    </p>    <p>      "The silver globe on today's market is valued at over $6.00    </p>		</div>
