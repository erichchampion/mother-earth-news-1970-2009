            		    <p>      <strong>FIELD-SIDE MEMORABILIA</strong>    </p>    <p>      Larger weeds (one to two feet high) tied together in      bunches and hung upside down for a few weeks make great      centerpieces . . . and bring in more dollars. Spray paint      the dried plants or leave them natural.    </p>    <p>      For handmade Christmas ornaments, gifts and novelties:      Collect opened milkweed pods in the fall. Pull the two      sides apart and let the pieces dry a few days to make sure      they're brown and free of moisture. Glue three half-pods      together to make a dove, or use just one segment as a fish      shape. Sew a single loop of thread in a central position      and spray paint or hand-decorate designs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FLOWERS FOR DRYING</strong>    </p>    <p>      The following are good materials for beginners, guaranteed      to dry well. Some of my pictures made from these      ingredients are now two years old and haven't discolored,      faded or deteriorated. Flat-petaled blooms are best . . .      petunias, roses, dahlias, etc., are no good unless you pull      apart the flower heads and rearrange them after they've      dried (a challenging project).    </p>        			    <p>      Every spring and summer, not so long ago, I'd grub daily in      the earth . . . weeding, mulching, coaxing my flower patch      to bloom. By July there would be buds, by August blooms and      by September death: the growing season over and a lot of      work and beauty lost. No more! Now, with the seedlings just      popping out of the ground, I'm looking forward to turning      those fleeting delights into long-lasting, attractive      floral "pictures" . . . and a handy source of extra cash.    </p>    <p>      I got started in this profitable craft almost by accident.      One day I picked a few cosmos blooms, brought them inside      and placed them between the pages of an old magazine      (remember the orchid from the high school prom?). Two weeks      later, I returned to find the flowers dried and still      perfect in shape and color. Inspired, I dug out an old      picture frame and was on my way. Here, for all you other      flower freaks, is the technique I've worked out since that      beginning.    </p>    <p>      First, the flowers. I've included with this article a list      of beginner-proof species, and you'll soon find other good      kinds near you . . . probably right outside the kitchen      door. Pick them, on a sunny day around noon, when there's a      minimum of humidity and dew on the petals.    </p>    <p>      Indoors, away from breezes and the kids, lay your treasures      on two thicknesses of paper toweling. Press each bloom flat      with your fingers. The center part can be removed if it's      too bulky, and the stem either snipped off or left,      depending on whether you like its looks. Space the prepared      materials half an inch apart on the sheet. When the page is      full, cover it with two more layers of toweling and several      open facial tissues. Then carefully place the "sandwich"      between the pages of a magazine. (Use an old, discarded      periodical-not a MOTHER-so you won't mind if      the paper is discolored in the process.)    </p>    <p>      Lay the closed magazine on a hard, flat surface (the attic      floor is low in humidity and out of harm's way). Bring out      the heaviest-bricks, dictionary, etc.-and place      them on top of the improvised flower press. The blossoms      will be dry and flat in a week or two.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, you can be collecting the rest of the materials.      Buy or find inexpensive black velvet (short, flat nap is      the best and least bulky to work with). Frames can be      bought complete in local discount stores-at a cost of      69 cents to 90 cents for three-by-five-inch or      five-by-seven-inch sizes-or picked up at roadside      flea markets for next to nothing. Look for those with the      glass intact. Missing backings don't matter . . . cardboard      taken from laundered, folded shirts or cereal boxes is      ideal in weight and stiffness. The finish of a frame, too,      is unimportant. Sandpaper and a can of spray paint work      wonders for a quick refurbishing.    </p>    <p>      Cut the cardboard 1/4 inch smaller all around than the      opening at the back of the frame. Next, prepare a piece of      velvet about 1/2 inch larger than the backing and glue it      over the cardboard, clipping and trimming the corners to      reduce the bulk. Dried ferns and flowers can then be set on      that background in any desired arrangement. Just place the      materials . . . don't glue them, or the petals will be      discolored. Each picture is unique and the variations      endless. Simple designs, though, are best.    </p>    <p>      Clean the glass well, <em>dry</em> it and place it over the      flowers. With the covering well pressed to the velvet, turn      the creation over (backside up) and slide the whole works      slowly into the frame. As long as the glass is held firmly,      the blossoms won't slip out of place. Practice will enable      you to do this fearlessly and well.    </p>    <p>      Then glue kraft paper (the brown grocery bag kind) over the      back of the frame, clean the glass in front and the picture      is finished. My first attempt took my beginner's thumbs      half an hour to assemble. Now I need only 15 minutes for      each floral ornament.    </p>    <p>      My craft began as a means of keeping all the beautiful life      of summer for my own pleasure . . . but soon grew into a      source of gifts which I gave friends and relatives on all      occasions. Even so, it took a lot of convincing from      Ron-my husband-and other fans before I was      ready to try marketing my craft. The first time out, I felt      most comfortable approaching a nearby community store that      specialized in the sale of homemade articles (and      particularly local goods). From there I went on to more      commercial shops. I shouldn't have been reluctant . . . my      pictures were welcomed.    </p>    <p>      We live near a populous center, so access to my market was      relatively easy. If your place is out in the backwoods, get      together 15 or 20 pictures and make a day of it downtown.      Go anywhere, from super-straight gift boutiques to real      head shops. There's no need to make a special sales effort.      Just be sincere and honest, and your genuine local      handcraft will practically sell itself. Most likely you'll      find-as I did-that people are really interested      and friendly from the start.    </p>    <p>      Almost all shops will take articles on a consignment basis      (that is, you leave four or five and when they're sold you      get the cash). Be sure to tell the proprietors what you      think your pictures should sell for ... you'll probably be      asked anyway. My five-by-seven-inch size goes for about      $3.00, and the store generally takes 10% of the price as      commission. The exposure is certainly worth 30 cents!    </p>    <p>      Give the storekeeper your name, address and telephone      number, if you have one, and don't leave the shop without a      receipt to show that the establishment has so many of your      pictures. Although I've found no rip-offs yet, it's best to      be on the safe side. File the paper carefully should you      need it in the future.    </p>    <p>      Then sit back and wait . . . but keep busy making more      Pictures and trying new places to sell. Usually you'll come      across a real business doer who will make a special effort      to display and talk up your goodies. Also, don't forget any      exhibits of local crafts in shopping centers and community      fairs.    </p>    <p>      Original work really goes over. The more effort you put      into the venture, the higher the return. Just use your eyes      and imagination, create, enjoy . . . and keep those extra      funds rolling in.    </p>
