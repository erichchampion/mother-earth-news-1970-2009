        <div class="sidebar"><p>In the last issue of MOTHER, we did two rather unusual things: [1] We asked how many folks would be interested in plunking down $10,000 for a 99-year lease on a small corner of our proposed Ecological Research Center and [2] we put up prize money totaling $5,000 for the best operational "food self-sufficient" idea that anyone comes up with within a period of one year.</p><p>Naturally, we expected very little response to the first action (who needs an excuse to <em>spend</em> money these days?) and a lot of interest in the second.</p><p>Well, it hasn't worked out that way. To date (mid-October) we've received at least 40 letters requesting more information, contributing further ideas or actually pledging money on the $10,000 deal . . . and one single, solitary piece of correspondence (but a good one!) suggesting a self-sufficient food concept.</p><p>Which proves, maybe, that there's more money than ideas floating around our culture . . . or that a lot of us are desperately hungry for a real people-oriented (rather than automobile-centered) community to live in . . . or that few folks have yet thought much about just how short food currently is in the world . . . or that it takes less time to write a letter about spending $10,000 than it does to put together a working prototype of a food production system . . . or something.</p><p>At any rate, we'll have a big feature (presenting ideas from the letters we've received) on the Research Center Community concept in MOTHER NO. 31. And, right now (just to emphasize the fact that we're serious about awarding a total of $5,000 to the people who come up with the best food self-sufficient ideas that we can gather), here's the story on that competition once again.</p></div><p>As you've surely noticed if you've done any eating lately, the cost of food has been going up. And not just in the supermarkets, either? Most of the stores that handle "organic" victuals have been posting higher prices right along with the crowd. As have the wholesalers who deal to food coops . . . and the grain dealers from whom some granola freaks buy their supplies . . . and even the farmers who man little roadside stands out in front of the Ole Home Place. And, unless you've learned to raise-or forage-most of what you ingest, it's a good bet that you'll be paying even higher prices for what you eat 12 months from now.</p><p>So OK. So maybe-as Paul Ehrlich pointed out in MOTHER NO. 28-it's time for us all to start reorganizing our lives on a very basic level. Maybe we should begin right now with food (which is about as basic as you can get) and see if there isn't some way that <em>any U.S.</em> or Canadian family-city, suburban or country-can become just as selfsufficient and self-contained as it might want to be. Right up to the theoretical 100%.</p><p>Now lest you snicker at the very idea of an urban family attempting to grow its own food, consider a half-page article by Bea Pixa which appeared in the May 19, 1974 <em>San Francisco Examiner & Chronicle.</em> The illustrated piece described-in sketchy detail-how Helga and Bill OIkowski raise "all the meat and vegetables" for six teenagers and adults on a 20 X 50-foot backyard and a small section of the roof area of their <em>urban</em> Berkeley, California home.</p><p>Or think about the amount of nourishment that might be harvested on a year-round basis from the backyard ecosystem that Jim DeKorne is currently describing in a series of MOTHER articles.</p><p>And then there's the $400 greenhouse that Clifford Ridley attached to his home out in Boulder, Utah and in which he claims he grows all the vegetables his five-member family can eat every month of the year . . . for a total annual cost of $100.</p><p>Or the rumors we keep hearing about the Community Technology Project in either Washington, D.C. or Philadelphia. According to unverified reports, someone in that project produced 1,000 pounds of trout in a tank located in the basement of a big city apartment house.</p><p>And don't forget Michael Dillon-the Britisher now living in Athens, Georgia-who raises the equivalent of a 175-foot-long garden row on a six-foot-tall rooftop tower (see Bits And Pieces, MOTHER NO. 28).</p><p>Still not convinced? Then you haven't seen the $4.00 book, <em>How</em>Â <em>to Grow More Vegetables (than you ever thought possible on less land than you can imagine)</em><em>.</em> It's by John Jeavons, Ecology Action of the Midpeninsula, 2225 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, California 94306. Get a copy, read what Alan Chadwick has done with the Bio-dynamic/French Intensive method of gardening . . . and then ponder for a few days.</p><p>Let's see now. What would happen if we used Chadwick's ideas in Ridley's greenhouse? Or tried Dillon's towers on the Olkowski roof? Or backed up a DeKorne-type ecosystem with all the sprouts and herbs and yogurt and other do-it-yourself provender that can be grown right in the kitchen? Or . . . .</p><p>So all right. So there does seem to be a real possibility for nutritional self-sufficiency for the average American family when we come at the problem from the production end. Now let's turn our attention for just a minute to the processing and consumption segments of the equation.</p><p>How much does it needlessly cost the planet every time our society ships a chicken from Arkansas to Chicago, cuts it up, cooks the bird, freezes it into a TV dinner . . . and then hauls that dinner to Cincinnati for sale to a consumer? And what does it cost the planet for that consumer to heat the meal for a half hour . . . and then dispose of the aluminum tray and the cardboard box it came in? What does it cost in terms of money, squandered nutrition, poor health, gasoline, steel for trucks, concrete for cold-storage warehouses, etc?</p><p>To give you an idea of just how different things could be, you should haunt the secondhand stores until you find a copy of a book published in 1939 and titled <em>How To Give On $1.00 A Week or How To Earn $100.00 A Week.</em> The guide was written by a fellow named Elmer C. Rice and it's a little weird to follow (Elmer invented "stream of consciousness" writing years before Jack Kerouac was invented). But it just happens to contain a few real gems tucked down in among Rice's personal flights of fancy. Turns out that Elmer figured anyone could make $100 a week (even back in 1939 when-as they say-a dollar was a dollar) raising squabs. And he had solid proof (since he had done it) that an individual could eat quite royally on $1.00 a week (say $5.00 a week now).</p><p>The secret of enjoying quality food on so little was something known as the Atkinson Oven. This was simply an insulated metal box designed to sit on a metal table which was just high enough to clear the chimney of a kerosene lamp. By filling a pot or two with the cheapest cuts of meats and the least expensive (but nourishing and filling) vegetables obtainable . . . and then covering the pots, stacking them in the box and burning a very low flame in the lamp . . . a nutritious meal could be prepared. Automatically. Without watching and without burning. Slow-cooked and tender with all the gravy, flavor, vitamins and minerals left in. With no need for an expensive "real" stove or oven. Without any packaging waste. Without any waste of food And-to stress the point once again-from <em>the least expensive</em> meats <em>and vegetables available.</em></p><p>Now then. There's no arguing the fact that a number of people have done-and are currently doing-some interesting work in grow-your-own-no-matter-where-you-live food production and low-energy-low-waste food processing and consumption.</p><p><em>The question is: Have their efforts given you any ideas? Can you do better than the examples cited here?</em></p><p>We hope so. In fact, we hope so much that THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) is hereby putting up prize money totaling $5,000 for the best "How To Become Food Self-Sufficient" concepts <em>which work</em> that we can find.</p><p>You'll find the rules of the competition and the prize money guarantee spelled out in the accompanying box.</p><p>So OK, all you budding Clifford Ridleys and Helga Olkowskis and Jim DeKornes. And OK all you real Clifford Ridleys and Helga Olkowskis and Jim DeKornes. Here's your chance to help the little people of the world . . . and maybe put a few bucks in your pocket at the same time. We're waiting to hear from you.</p><h3>The <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> "How To Become Food Self-Sufficient" Competition Rules and Regulations</h3><p>This competition is open to anyone except current and former employees of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> or any of the magazine's subsidiary operations and shall run from midnight, September 30, 1974 to midnight, September 30, 1975.
