                    <h5 id="byline">      by MARTHA SCHAFER    </h5>        <p>      Among all the alternative business ideas I've seen in      MOTHER, no one has mentioned the mistletoe game. Perhaps      that's because the plant-a traditional holiday      decoration-is plentiful only in a limited region.      <em>("New Jersey, e. Pennsylvania, W. Virginia, s. Ohio, s.      Illinois, and s.e. Kansas to Florida and e. Texas,"      according to</em> A Field Guide to Trees and Shrubs by      <em>George A. Petrides.-MOTHER.)</em> Here in      Kentucky, though, the trees are full of it and the      whiteberried sprigs sell like mad during a brief season      (the day after Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve). I've made as      much as $50.00 just from one afternoon's picking, at the      rate of 25 cents for a large spray . . . but to      <em>really</em> bring in money, you'd operate in the      following fashion:    </p>    <p>      First find a source of mistletoe by driving around in the      country until you spot an area where the parasitic plant is      dense. Mistletoe seems to prefer old oaks, but is also      found on black walnut and other trees. Its clusters of      thick yellow-green leaves stand out clearly among the      host's bare branches.    </p>    <p>      If you find mistletoe-bearing trees that overlook a public      road, well and good. If they're in someone's pasture, it's      best to ask permission before you gather (few will refuse)      and then to drop off a nice bunch as a "thank you" to the      owner. Since mistletoe is a parasite that slowly kills its      hosts, you're doing the trees a favor by removing the      infestation. On the other hand, it's practically impossible      to get rid of for good-it grows back and is thought      to be transmitted by birds-so you won't be upsetting      any natural balance.    </p>    <p>      Here in the South, the traditional method of getting      mistletoe out of high branches is to blast it down with a      shotgun. I don't recommend that, however, since you want      nice large sprigs with a lot of white berries. What you      need is someone-perhaps a teenaged son-who's      good at climbing trees.    </p>    <p>      Right after Thanksgiving-perferably on a sunny,      windless day-drive out to your mistletoe "patch",      with a climber and possibly a ladder. You also might want      to take along one of those long-handled tree trimmers,      which isn't necessary but which will let you reach the most      beautiful bunches that are always very high up or out on      limbs too thin to take a person's weight.    </p>    <p>      Since the object is to break off as few berries as possible      from the sprigs you collect, you might want some big      shoulder-strap bags like those used in cottonpicking.      Climbing around in trees with a large sack is very clumsy,      though, and you may prefer to bring an old sheet and drop      the pieces into it. (Have two people hold the "net" clear      of the ground, leaving a bit of slack.) In the latter case,      you'll also need some boxes.    </p>    <p>      Don't spend more than two hours portal to portal on this      expedition. A nice outing can turn into a cold, exhausting      chore if you work too long. Anyhow, you don't want to pick      more than a couple of big boxfuls at a time. (Mistletoe      will hold up well if kept cool and damp. Sprinkle your      collection with water and cover it with moist newspapers or      rags, but don't let it get <em>wet.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Sort the day's take of mistletoe when you get home, to see      what size sprigs you have. You may want to discard some,      break up others into smaller sprays or even tie small bits      together to distribute the berries among the leaves. I find      that adding a decoration such as a red ribbon doesn't pay      off: It takes a lot of time and work, the ribbon costs      money and people don't seem to buy more because of the      effort.    </p>    <p>      Next, you need an outlet (which you should actually have      lined up first of all) and your sales-of      course-can be wholesale, retail or both.    </p>    <p>      Wholesale markets include florists, craft shops and      boutiques (especially stores that are located near an      interstate highway and rely on the tourist trade). You can      also arrange to provide a large amount of mistletoe for the      high school Christmas dance, the firemen's ball or the      Junior League and church parties. Check the newspaper for      announcements of large gatherings and weddings during the      Christmas season, and contact the people concerned about      using a load of your wares as decorations.    </p>    <p>      Actually, the list of possible wholesale outlets is      practically endless (it includes anyone who's doing      large-scale Christmas decorations that don't have to take a      beating over a long period of time). To capture this      market, however, requires real salesmanship and hustling on      your part . . . and the money to be made is only a fraction      of what you can realize from retail sales.    </p>    <p>      If you do go the wholesale route, however, you'll want to      know that I've charged $5.00 for a carton about like a beer      case, and the same amount of mistletoe might sell for      double that rate in the North. Remember that a shop which      intends to resell needs to make a profit, but groups,      schools and clubs that use the plant for decoration can pay      a little more.    </p>    <p>      To retail mistletoe profitably, you need to take your      harvest to a really large city. You must then decide      whether to dodge cops or go legit. The latter approach      requires a street vendor's license which costs money and      may not be granted at all in some places. You can find out      at the city hall. With such a permit, you have one less      worry and can devote all your thinking to sales.    </p>    <p>      If you prefer, you can just set up on the street, keep an      eye out for the police and move on at their appearance . .      . but you do risk a whopping fine or worse. Ever seen news      photos of an English spasm band running down the street      with tuba and bass drum, chased by an irate bobby? Or a      Mexican mariachi group, bass and <em>guitarone</em> flying,      with the <em>policia</em> in hot pursuit? It could happen      to you.    </p>    <p>      Retailing-legal or illegal-can be done in two      ways. You can pick a good corner in a busy downtown section      or shopping center, rig yourself an eye-catching get-up,      pin mistletoe all over your costume, put a sign on your      back, around your head or on a pole . . . and let the      customers come to you. Or you can dress very respectably,      go to the wealthy and middle-class residential sections and      ring doorbells. One other gimmick is to use younger      children, say 8 to 11 years old, to do the selling. No cop      is going to arrest a youngster that age, and people tend to      buy from them more easily.    </p>    <p>      Retailing requires little salesmanship other than the nerve      to approach people and ask them to buy your product.      Physically, though, it's very hard work . . . cold and      tough on the feet.    </p>    <p>      The retail price of mistletoe is an important consideration      which varies according to region. In the North it would be      possible to sell a bunch of two nice sprigs with berries      for $1.00 . . . and single sprays at 50 cents would go like      wildfire. I'm sure one could make $100 a week in the      Christmas season on a part-time basis, putting in no more      than 20 hours of work altogether. An average church group      or club that worked the retail and wholesale angles full      time could clear $4,000 or $5,000 . . . provided their      supply of mistletoe held out.    </p>    <p>      Traditionally, mistletoe is a bringer of good fortune      (hence the custom of greeting friends or stealing a kiss      under its branches). Whatever the plant's powers, it can at      least furnish you and your friends a little extra      prosperity during the holiday season . . . with no magic      other than a bit of work.    </p>
