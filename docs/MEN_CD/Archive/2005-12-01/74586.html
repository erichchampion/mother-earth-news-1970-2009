        <h3>From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005</h3>Regarding grass-fed cattle: Fescue grass in the Midwest has an endophyte fungus that produces several potent toxins. These toxins cause disease in cattle, horses and other grazing animals. Please, please pay attention to this.<br /><h5>Paul Glynn<br />Sparta, Missouri</h5><p>Allan Nation, editor of the <a href="http://www.stockmangrassfarmer.com/sgf/" target="_blank">Stockman Grassfarmer</a>, responds:</p><p><i>Mr. Glynn is correct. Endophyte-infected fescue should not be used for grass-fed beef as it will impart an unpleasant off-flavor to the meat as well as lower the animal’s gain to an unacceptable level. Today, however, endophyte-free varieties of fescue are available, as well as “novel endophyte” varieties that contain “good” endophytes for increased insect resistance - not the bad ones that cause the ill effects. With the correct grasses, the Midwest can be a prime grass-fed beef-producing region.</i></p>
