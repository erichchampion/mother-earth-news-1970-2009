        <h5>From Country Lore - Dec/Jan 2005</h5><p>I have been a bicyclist for 30 years and offer this suggestion: We all have read about the benefits of riding a bicycle instead of driving a car. Indeed, bicycling has many advantages - you don’t need gas, don’t pollute, get exercise and provide your own cooling breeze.</p><p>Many people have a bicycle and use it only for recreation. But more cities are building bike trails. With the simple addition of a rack over the rear wheel, you can use the bike for grocery shopping and errands; such racks usually cost $25 to $50. Add bungee cords and you can strap your briefcase to the rack. For $40 to $150, you can add saddlebags, usually called panniers, to carry two grocery bags and even a change of clothes.</p><p>When you bicycle, seek out the streets least used by cars. Bike trails often are faster and more convenient because there are no traffic lights - or the cars they control - to slow you down. And always wear your helmet. It is the cheapest health insurance you can buy.</p><h5>Jim Lovestar<br />Minneapolis, Minnesota</h5>
