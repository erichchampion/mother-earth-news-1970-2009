                    <p>      Mounting evidence suggests that it’s time to take      global warming seriously, and the rising costs of gas and      oil are making everyone nervous. Clearly it’s time to      explore how to make our lives more self-reliant and secure.    </p>    <p>      In this issue, “Slash Your Heating Bills” (Page      26) outlines how you can reduce your heating costs this      winter. Last issue, we brought you a series of articles      about how to choose a more fuel-efficient car, and we are      planning to increase our coverage of energy issues in 2006.    </p>    <p>      For more inspiration and advice right now, check out our      digital Archive at www.MotherEarthNews.com. Mother Earth      News readers have been reporting on clever, conscientious      and sometimes corny energy-efficiency ideas for more than      35 years, and all of Mother’s articles can be      accessed through the Archive. It’s amazing how many      excellent ideas and exceptional projects we’ve      published over the years. All of that wisdom is      particularly valuable now, as we confront the twin      challenges of global warming and declining supplies of      fossil fuels.    </p>    <p>      Here’s a sample of the articles in the Archive about      low-cost, easy-to-install solar hot-air collectors:    </p>    <p>      Ultra-simple Solar Hot-air Wall Heater. This unit is made      by covering a 1-by-6-foot wood frame with clear plastic,      mounting the panel on a south-facing wall and installing      top and bottom vents into the home.    </p>    <p>      Recycled Aluminum Can Solar Heater. Cans cut in half are      used to construct the absorber plate for this double-glazed      solar hot-air collector. Temperatures in the collector      reach more than 200 degrees, and the original unit reduced      the heating costs of a New England church by more than 60      percent.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        <strong>Want Free Weekly Wise Living Advice?</strong>      </p>      <p>        Sign up for our new Mother Earth Living e-mail newsletter        and get quick tips on home heating, transportation and        other wise living topics.

This article details how      to use recycled storm windows to make a solar hot-air      collector that delivers heat into the home through a vent      installed into a south-facing window.    </p>    <p>      There are several ways you can tap into Mother’s      digital Archive.
