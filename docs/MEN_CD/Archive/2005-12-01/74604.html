        <h5>From Dear Mother - Dec/Jan 2005</h5><p>Thanks for helping your readers pay attention to the efficiency of their automobiles. I am endlessly amazed at the great number of environmentally aware folks who can’t tell me how many miles to the gallon their cars get.</p><p>We recently considered a 2002 Toyota Echo. It was in excellent shape, had low mileage and cost only $7,000. But in the end we went with a 1999 Ford Escort SE sedan with a “Split-port Induction 2000” engine. We knew from our 1995 Escort LX wagon that an Escort five-speed would get 40 miles per gallon or high 30s on the highway and mid-30s in the “city.” The price was $2,500. We could afford the Escort out of pocket and save $4,500 in debt over the Echo, which would have slowed our investment in the homestead/farm. Our mechanic drives an Escort and says they are made well enough that, with proper maintenance, we can expect more than 300,000 miles from these great “low-end” cars!</p><p>In the mid-1980s, Volvo sold a car in Europe that, because of its superlight body (with a passenger area hardened to be as safe as any other Volvo), got more than 70 mpg. Likewise we read about a German car that got more than 70 mpg in the city and 100-plus on the highway. It seems that MOTHER could help light some fires with a report on how the rest of the world is addressing the mileage issue.</p><h5>Patryk Battle<br />Burnsville, North Carolina</h5>
