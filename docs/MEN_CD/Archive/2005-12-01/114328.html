                    <p>      During the winter cold season, many people turn to      echinacea supplements to boost their immunity and fight off      illness. In 2004, a U.S. government survey found that      echinacea was the nation’s most popular herbal      medicine, used by 40 percent of those who bought herbal      products.    </p>    <p>      But echinacea’s effectiveness was called into      question last July, when the New England Journal of      Medicine published the results of a large clinical trial      that found the herb did not help treat or prevent colds.      The study, funded by the National Center for Complementary      and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), made headlines across the      country, most of them declaring the end of echinacea as a      cold remedy.    </p>    <p>      Does that mean you should throw away the echinacea in your      medicine cabinet  Not so fast, says Mark Blumenthal,      executive director of the American Botanical Council (ABC),      a nonprofit organization that promotes research and      education on medicinal plants.    </p>    <p>      “The study was well conducted; it was very well      controlled, but this is not the definitive study,”      Blumenthal says. “It needs to be seen in the context      of the many other trials of echinacea.” The ABC,      which publishes in-depth reference information on medicinal      herbs, has posted research on echinacea at      www.herbalgram.org. Among the 21 studies listed, 18 found      positive results, with three finding no significant      effects.    </p>        <p>      As the researchers themselves noted in the NCCAM study,      it’s difficult to prove or disprove that echinacea      fights colds because so many forms of the herb are used.      Commonly called purple coneflower, echinacea is a genus      with three different species that are used      medicinally-Echinacea purpurea, E. pallida, and E.      angustifolia. Medicinal preparations may contain either the      root or the aboveground portion of the plant from any of      these species, and they may be prepared as dried herbs      available in capsules, liquid extract sold as a tincture,      or even dried extracts. Even the geographic location of the      plant and the time of year it was harvested can affect its      chemical composition, according to the researchers who      conducted the NCCAM study.    </p>    <p>      For that trial, the researchers used a tincture of E.      angustifolia root three times a day in dosages that were      equivalent to 300 milligrams. The trial was conducted on      437 college students who were given cold viruses and then      sequestered in hotel rooms. Those given extracts of E.      angustifolia did not display any fewer infections or      shorter duration of the cold symptoms than those who did      not receive the herb; and the extracts were not any more      effective when given before exposure to the virus than they      were in reducing its effects.    </p>    <p>      One of the study’s co-authors, Dr. Rudolf Bauer, told      The New York Times that different dosages, species and      preparations of echinacea should be tested, and that he      personally will continue to take echinacea.    </p>    <p>      Blumenthal says that while this study provides useful      information about this preparation of E. angustifolia at      that particular dosage, he thinks the dosage tested should      have been higher.    </p>    <p>      The 900 milligrams-per-day level was determined according      to the echinacea guidelines published for a different      species (E. pallida) by Commission E-a German      government committee that compiled a widely used reference.      But more recent standards, including those set by the World      Health Organization and the Canadian National Health      Products Directorate, recommend a dosage level of 3,000      milligrams a day.    </p>    <p>      “The whole thing is about dosage,” Blumenthal      says. “It’s like taking one-third of an aspirin      and wondering why you still have a headache.”    </p>    <p>      Blumenthal’s advice is to take echinacea the same way      he does. As soon as he notices cold symptoms, Blumenthal      takes a tincture of immune-boosting herbs including      echinacea, astragalus, andrographis and elderberry syrup,      about two droppersful every two to four hours for two days.      “I take big doses right away, and usually within 24      to 36 hours, I have it knocked out.”    </p>    <p>      - Megan Phelps    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        sprouts & snippets      </h3>      <p>        Free Birds      </p>      <p>        More U.S. businesses and universities are joining the        campaign to discontinue the purchase of eggs from caged        chickens. In 2005, natural food retail chains such as        Earth Fare, Jimbo’s…Naturally and Wild Oats        Natural Marketplace announced that they would no longer        sell eggs from caged hens. Several universities,        including George Washington University, the University of        Arizona and the University of Connecticut, also have        stopped purchasing eggs laid by chickens confined in        cages.

It authorizes as much as $4 billion in new        federal spending for bike paths, trails and related        programs through September 2009. The law includes close        to $2 billion for new bike paths, lanes and safe        crossings; $612 million for construction of safe routes        to schools; $70 million for recreational trails; and $100        million to develop bicycle/pedestrian communities in a        handful of cities. “This transportation bill should        be at least $1 billion better for bicycling than the last        bill that passed in 1998,” says Tim Blumenthal,        executive director of the Bikes Belong Coalition, a        national bicycle industry advocacy group that was        instrumental in maximizing bike funding in this bill.

Last August, Hurricane Katrina left Florida        as a Category 1 hurricane with winds up to 95 mph and        then weakened to a mild tropical storm. But as Katrina        moved through the warmer waters of the Gulf of Mexico, it        transformed into a Category 5 hurricane, with winds up to        175 mph (shown above).      </p>      <p>        Three weeks later, Hurricane Rita entered the Gulf and in        two days went from Category 1 to Category 5. In October,        Hurricane Wilma became the most powerful storm ever        recorded in the Atlantic Ocean basin.      </p>      <p>        Ekwurzel says it’s hard to blame any one weather        event-be it a hurricane, a heat wave or a        blizzard-on global warming, but recent research        from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)        shows that the duration and wind speed of hurricanes have        significantly increased over the last 30 years. Another        study from the Georgia Institute of Technology found that        the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has doubled in        the last 30 years, parallel to increases in average ocean        surface temperatures over the same period. Most of the        strongest hurricanes on record have occurred in the last        decade, when ocean surface temperatures reached record        levels.      </p>      <p>        MIT research also suggests that hurricanes will only get        more powerful and last longer as global warming increases        ocean temperatures.      </p>      <p>        “In addition, as oceans warm and glaciers melt, sea        levels will continue to rise,” Ekwurzel says.        “Higher sea levels mean bigger storm surges, even        from minor storms, causing coastal flooding, erosion and        property damage.”      </p>      <p>        Global warming is primarily the result of carbon dioxide        and other greenhouse gases-produced by the burning        of fossil fuels in cars and power plants-that        blanket the Earth and trap heat. Because 75 percent of        the Earth is covered by oceans, they absorb most of this        heat. Temperatures already have risen in recent decades,        and because greenhouse gases can stay in the atmosphere        for 100 or more years, temperatures will continue to rise        even if emissions are held at current levels.      </p>      <p>        “For economic and environmental reasons, and above        all to save human lives, President Bush and other elected        officials must take action to reduce heat-trapping        emissions,” Ekwurzel says.      </p>      <p>        Solutions to combat global warming and the climate        disruption it causes, according to Ekwurzel, include        encouraging automakers to design more fuel-efficient        cars, requiring more of our energy to come from renewable        sources, establishing a federal cap on emissions and        requiring more energy efficiency in public and private        buildings. “Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have shown        us that the time for studies, denials and false debate is        over,” she says.

To accomplish          his quest, he enlisted the help of George Vose, a          70-year-old ex-World War II fighter pilot and          Vose’s almost-as-ancient, rattletrap,          single-engine Cessna plane.        </p>        <div class="image">          <img src="../images/213-020-OntheWing-CMYK.jpg" alt="213-020-OntheWing-CMYK.jpg" width="392" height="600" />          <p class="caption">            On the Wing: To the Edge of the Earth with the            Peregrine Falcon. By Alan Tennant (Knopf, 2004)          </p>        </div>        <p>          An inveterate and accomplished aviator, Vose had been          hired by the U.S. Army to radio-track the short-term          movements of peregrines as they left South Padre          Island. It was during one of these tracking flights          that Tennant, onboard to observe, grew frustrated with          the Army’s limited research goals and began to          hatch a plot to follow a falcon all the way home. A          self-proclaimed outlaw, Tennant “borrowed”          the Army’s sophisticated tracking equipment and,          together with Vose, began a multiyear transcontinental          odyssey of enlightenment and concern over the plight of          peregrine falcons, which are the fastest animals on the          planet.        </p>        <p>          As a current member of the Padre Island Peregrine          Falcon Survey team, I am struck by the author’s          vivid portrayal of the stark beauty and unique natural          history of South Padre Island and its importance as a          refuge for peregrines, as well as for hundreds of other          migrating bird species. In captivating narrative,          Tennant describes the landscapes and habitats, the          wonders and the perils encountered by peregrines along          their migration routes-scenes that I have often          imagined after releasing a freshly banded falcon to          continue on its way.        </p>        <p>          Unfortunately, Tennant exercises literary license with          some of the facts, such as the portrayal of Prescott          Ward, a biologist who took exception to Tennant’s          unauthorized and illegal activities. Tennant did not          have the proper training or the necessary permits          required to work with peregrines, and his actions put          the whole project at risk of being shut down. Still,          his concern for the species is sincere.        </p>        <p>          Though the peregrine falcon has recovered from the          brink of extinction, there still are threats such as          rampant coastal development and the spread of the West          Nile Virus and Avian Influenza. The public’s          fascination with peregrines and concern for their          welfare remains as passionate today as when Tennant and          Vose undertook their own epic migrations.        </p>        <p>          More than just a superb account of natural history, On          the Wing is part exotic travelogue, part epic adventure          saga, part coming-of-middle-age chronicle and part          buddy story. Tennant’s tale is wondrous,          suspenseful, hilarious and introspective. It is a book          that crosses many genres and should appeal to a wide          variety of readers.        </p>        <p>          - Brian Latta        </p>        <p>          Brian Latta is a field biologist for the Predatory Bird          Research Group at the University of California at Santa          Cruz, working primarily with peregrine falcon recovery.
