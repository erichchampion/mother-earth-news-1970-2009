Then pack your root veggies into thecontainer with sand or straw, and pull them out as you need themfor cooking.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Another option is to keep them in a cold corner of your garageor shed. A little frost can actually make them sweeter, as starchesconvert to sugar, but don't let them freeze completely.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>When looking for spots to store your root vegetables thiswinter, just experiment.
