        <h3>From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005</h3><p>I am sure I am not the only one to be really surprised to know that there (still) are people out there who lack the simple truth of how we have impacted the Earth’s delicate balance. Jonathan McElroy’s view on environmentalism is the result of the ugly, shortsighted thinking of a “Compartmentalization Theorist.” The inability of this person to possess enough insight angers, worries and embarrasses me as a fellow human being! It is not about so-called groups, environmentalists or crazy-acting people! It is all about continually substantiated scientific facts, done by real scientists, and the unfortunate findings of those studies. What are we going to do about it all? That’s the point!</p><p>We are all on this Earth together, like it or not! We need to take care of the soil beneath our feet and the air filling our lungs; it all works together like a perfect song. Thanks! Glad you are here MOTHER!</p><h5>Julie Bakerville<br />Oak Valley, California</h5><p><br /></p>
