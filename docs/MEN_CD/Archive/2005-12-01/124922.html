        Beef from a cow raised on pasture is a safer choice than feedlot beef, offers richer flavor and more nutrition, and is even healthier for you than a chicken breast. Here are five benefits of eating pasture-raised cattle:<br /><ul><li>Grass-fed beef is one-third to three times leaner than conventional grain-fed beef, and as a consequence has fewer calories, too.</li><li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none"></li><li>Grass-fed beef has two to four times more essential omega-3 fatty acids than feedlot beef. It also contains more beta carotene, vitamin E and folic acid.</li><li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none"></li><li>Researchers have found grass-fed beef contains two newly discovered 'good' fats: conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and trans-vaccenic acid (TVA). CLA shows great promise in lab animal studies of helping fight cancers and cardiovascular disease.</li><li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none"></li><li>Grass-fed beef has no extra hormones or traces of antibiotics. The animals also live a low-stress life, grazing outside on pasture, in contrast to the stinking, dusty, shadeless conditions in most commercial feedlots.</li><li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none"></li><li>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, or more commonly, mad cow disease), has not been found in grass-finished animals. And grass-finished cattle are also less likely to be contaminated with acid-resistant forms of E. coli, a serious food-borne bacteria.</li></ul><p style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">The following Web sites allow you to find grass-finished meat in your area by entering your Zip code or city and state: <a title="Eat Wild" href="http://www.eatwild.com/" target="_blank">Eat Wild</a>, <a title="Local Harvest" href="http://www.localharvest.org/" target="_blank">Local Harvest</a> and <a title="Eat Well Guide" href="http://www.eatwellguide.org/" target="_blank">Eat Well Guide</a>.<br /><br />To learn more about pastured and grass-fed meat, visit our <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/safemeat" title="Safe Meat Page" target="_blank">Safe Meat Page</a>.</p>
