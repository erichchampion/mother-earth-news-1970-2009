                    <h3>      A Simple Lifesaver    </h3>    <p>      Recent studies in Indonesia have added what the <em>World      Development Forum</em> calls a "mind boggling" dimension to      the use of vitamin A in treating Third World children.      Large doses of the vitamin, administered only twice a year      - at a cost of 35 cents per dose - to 30,000      children between the ages of one and six, reduced the      mortality rate among those youngsters by 35%.    </p>        <h3>      High Protein Wheat Rises to the Top    </h3>    <p>      When placed in a solution of sugar, salt, and water, wheat      seeds that are high in protein float to the surface. In a      new (and simplified) method of protein analysis, the USDA      soaks seeds in freezing water for nine to ten days (which      allows their protein to absorb five times as much water as      their starch does) and then immerses them in a solution of      21% sugar, 24% salt, and 55% water. The seeds highest in      protein - those that have absorbed the most water      - float to the top. USDA researchers say the      technique reveals which seeds genetically favor a higher      protein level; such seeds could be chosen for planting by      developing countries in order to improve the nutritional      value of bread and other foods made from locally grown      grains.    </p>    <h3>      Helping the Rural Disabled    </h3>    <p>      For the estimated 8.5 million disabled Americans living in      rural areas, everyday facets of country life can be      challenging (and lonely) tasks. So Rural Rehabilitation      Technologies Database, a project of the University of North      Dakota, is putting together a catalog aimed at helping such      people. And <em>while</em> the publication will include      commercial products designed for handicapped individuals,      its compilers, recognizing the resourceful nature of      country dwellers, have gotten many of the ideas,      techniques, and equipment designs from the rural disabled      themselves. Submissions are no longer being accepted for      the catalog scheduled to come out later this year, but the      folks at Database tell us they're hoping to put out more      editions, so your ideas are still welcome. To request a      submission form (which includes a section to fill out if      you wish to protect your patent rights) or to be put on the      project's mailing list, write to Rural Rehabilitation      Technologies Database, Medical Center Rehabilitation      Hospital, Box 8202, University Station, Grand Forks, ND      58202.    </p>    <h3>      Gourmet Crops Are Where It's At    </h3>    <p>      Experts are predicting abundant profits for growers smart      enough to cash in on the new demand for specialty      vegetables. Agricultural economists at Cornell University      report a "tremendous upsurge in the demand for fresh      vegetables over the past ten years," but note that farmers      raising "traditional" crops are being left behind by those      marketing such gourmet treats as endive, chicory, leeks,      and miniature vegetables. Commercial growers are      discovering that herbs, as well as oriental and other      "ethnic" vegetables, are especially hot sellers now. Home      gardeners, too, may be pleasantly surprised by how easily      such exotics can be raised in backyard plots.    </p>        <h3>      Telly Bellies    </h3>    <p>      Just in case you need one more good reason to cut down on      your family's daily intake of television, now there's      evidence TV may be fattening. <em>The Harvard Medical      School Health Letter</em> reports that national data      collected in the 1960s and recently reanalyzed shows that      in a sample of more than 11,000 youngsters, the ones who      watched the most television were the ones most likely to be      obese. And it wasn't that already overweight children were      using TV-viewing as an escape from social situations; the      newsletter points out that the obese children in the study      spent as much time with friends as the nonobese children      did. Another extended study showed that the more television      normal-weight children watched, the more likely they were      to be overweight a few years later. No one knows exactly      why TV is fattening, but the most likely explanation is      that children plopped in front of television sets are      simply not getting enough exercise.    </p>    <h3>      Mail-Order Tax Alert    </h3>    <p>      Readers who own mail-order businesses will want to keep an      eye on a new piece of mail-order sales tax legislation      (H.R. 3549) that at press time (mid-January) was pending      before the House Judiciary Committee. There is talk that      the bill would require anyone selling merchandise or      services by mail to register in, and collect sales tax for,      every state they sell to. Sponsors of the regulation claim      that state governments miss out on millions of dollars      annually from mail-order sales. However, opponents point      out that the expense and paperwork would put many small      mail-order companies out of business. To find out the      current status of the bill, write to Peter Rodino,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, 2137 Rayburn HOB,      Washington, DC 20515.

Some multinational      corporations that met in Geneva last year are concerned      because they aren't getting a big enough piece of the pie.      Since many farmers still grow their own seed, companies and      organizations supply only 63% of what is planted. The      multinationals are looking ahead to the year 2000 when,      according to a report from the Pesticide Action Network      (PAN), approximately 12 global companies are expected to      dominate the seed market. By then, the value of all seeds      incorporating "biotech improvements" is expected to      increase from $8 million at present to $6.8 billion.    </p>
