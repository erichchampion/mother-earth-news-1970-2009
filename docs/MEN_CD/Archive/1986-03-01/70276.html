                    <p>      <em>A "reel" simple way to speed up lawn maintenance:</em>    </p>        <p>      Enjoying a plush green lawn is a heck of a lot easier than      maintaining one, especially if your domain is measured in      acres rather than square feet. Of course, if you've got a      tractor and a mower deck, you're one step ahead of the      game. But if you don't, and if you're scratching for an      economical means of keeping the greens trimmed this coming      season, our homebuilt gang mower might be just what you're      looking for.    </p>    <p>      Now, there are probably several reasons why this mowing      attachment shouldn't work, but the design is so blamed      simple that there's hardly any room for flaws. When      planning this project, we immediately dismissed powered      rotary-mower decks because of their cost and maintenance      requirements, and because a four-wheeled carriage wouldn't      track correctly through turns. Rather, we chose to use old      push-type reel mowers: They're still not too difficult to      come by (and at junk prices), they demand only an      occasional sharpening, and they're easy to maneuver.    </p>    <p>      At first glance, it would appear that, without the pressure      of someone pushing down on the handle, the wheels would      merely skid across the turf rather than turn and drive the      blade. By the same token, it'd seem that the handleless      carriages would want to seek their own direction while      being towed. Both these worries were eliminated by      designing the tow bars as extensions of the handles:      Instead of just pulling the mowers forward, the angled      shafts tend to draw them downward as well. And since the      bars are fastened between the original handle mounts, each      carriage moves only in the direction of the bar pulling it.    </p>    <p>      If you want to try your hand at working up your own gang      mower implement, look first at the vehicle you'll be using      to pull-it. Our initial tests were done with the homebuilt      minitractor featured in MOTHER NOS. 76-78, using a simple      drawbar fastened to its three-point hitch. Soon thereafter,      we rigged up a sturdy belly hitch for a staffer's      all-terrain vehicle to see how well it could handle      yardwork. Both machines had the power at fast-walking      speeds to operate the threemower gang . . . the difference      being that the tractor was working in high gear, while the      ATV did the pulling in its lower ranges. Either way, the      towing vehicle must be able to move at a reasonable pace to      maintain the inertia of the spinning blades.    </p>        <p>      Once you've decided you have an appropriate means of      propulsion, you can launch a search for your mowers. We      paid a total of $19 for our three reels, one of which was a      steel-wheeled, seven-blade model which represents the      zenith of push-mower technology. All had separate handle      mounts from which the handle shaft could- be removed;      without that feature, the handle will have to be cut just      above the point where it spreads.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the mowers, you'll need three 26" pieces of      1" electrical metallic tubing or other thin-wall pipe, a      33" length of the same material, a hunk of 1/8" X 1/2" X 2"      X 11" channel iron, two 5/16" X 2" X 3-1/2" Ubolts, and at      least five scraps of bar stock measuring 3/8" X 1" X 3" or      so. You'll also need a half-dozen 3/8" X 2-1/2" bolts and      some short sections of 1 /4" Schedule 40 pipe, as well as a      drill with metal-cutting bits, and some means of bending      the thin-wall conduit without kinking it. (Conduit benders      can be purchased for about $16 . . . or you can see if a      local electrician will loan one for a few minutes.)    </p>    <p>      It's best to fabricate the lead mower framework first. This      involves nothing more than bending one of the 26" lengths      of tubing at a 45Â° angle to form a tow bar that pulls      the mower from a point just below the handle mounts. To      keep those mounts from crush ing the tube, slide the short      sections of 1/4" pipe crosswise into the conduit after you      match-drill the handle holes, then replace the bolts. The      front of the bar is reinforced with a drilled bar stock      insert . . . and the channel iron tongue is then fastened      to the beefed-up conduit with a 3/8" bolt.    </p>    <p>      To make the crossbar that pulls the two trailing mowers,      simply tap a bar stock section into each end of the 33"      tube, then flatten the ends in a vise and drill a 7/16"      hole through each "ear." Use the U-bolts to secure the bar      to the lower sections of the handle mounts, making sure      that the bolt plates are substantial enough to hold without      bending. (If they're not, replace them with scraps of the      3/8" bar stock.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, rig up the remaining two tow bars as you did the      first one. The attachment at the handle mounts is the same      . . . but instead of adding a channel iron tongue, just      drill a 7116" hole through each remaining piece of bar      stock, slide them into the ends of the tubes as before, and      use these inserts as tongues. Then connect the trailing      mowers to the crossbar with 3/8" bolts, and you're ready to      roll.    </p>    <p>      Just as with any mower, the sharper the blades, the better      the cut. Our three 16" reels clipped a 48"-wide swath      without missing a spot, even at the greater speeds      necessitated by the ATV. If you do choose to use an      all-terrain vehicle to pull the mowers and you don't have a      factory- or dealer-supplied hitch, be sure to attach your      drawbar to a substantial part of the vehicle's main frame      and not just to a fender support or other lightweight      member.    </p>
