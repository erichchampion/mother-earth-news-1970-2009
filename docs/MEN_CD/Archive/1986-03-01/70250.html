                <p>      <em>The question: How can you break spaded soil into fine      particles before you plant? The answer:</em>    </p>            <p>      Tilthing ... most people aren't even familiar with the      <em>word</em> , much less the activity. Alan Chadwick, the      founder of biodynamic/French intensive gardening, brought      this British skill (and verb) to this country along with      his other ingenious gardening methods. And every spring (as      well as before all new plantings later in the season),      MOTHER's gardeners employ the technique themselves. Over      and over, they swing their garden forks at the soil,      looking almost like baseball batters who can only hit down      . . . or golfers whose swings always stop at the ground.    </p>    <p>      For that's what tilthing is: swinging a fork into dug-up      soil to break up those pesky surface clods. Yet while the      basic idea of tilthing is simple, mastering the skill      - i.e., learning how to do it so you accomplish the      most work <em>without</em> wearing yourself out in the      process - takes understanding and practice. We'll try      to explain the method as clearly as we can with the words      and pictures here. The practice is up to you.    </p>    <p>      First, you'll need a garden fork. The cheap hardware      versions are OK as long as you're gardening in easy-to-work      loamy soil. A better tool is a high-quality, thin-tined      cultivating fork, such as the ones offered by Smith &      Hawken Tool Company (25 Corte Madera, Mill Valley, CA      94941).    </p>    <p>      Make sure the soil is workable before you start. If it's      too wet, you'll create more clods than you disperse. And if      it's too dry, trying to tilth it will quickly exhaust you.      In the latter case, water the plot thoroughly the day      before you start.    </p>    <p>      When you and your soil are ready, stand in front of the bed      to be worked. If you start out right-handed, grab the fork      near its head with your right hand and partway down the      shaft with the other (don't grab the handle - "choke      up" on the shaft). Swing the tool in an arc so it strikes      the surface with a <em>sideways</em> , almost glancing,      blow. Never bang <em>down</em> - you'll just wear      yourself out. And don't hit the ground hard; let the weight      of the tool do most of the work.    </p>        <p>      Tilthing doesn't work the ground deeply - after a      series of repeated choplike blows, you'll have pulverized      only the surface soil right in front of you. So dig down at      that spot to turn up subsurface clods, and tilth them.    </p>    <p>      You may need to redig and retilth one spot three or four      times before you'll have busted all the lumps in the top      six to eight inches of ground. To keep from wearing      yourself out, switch directions - from tilthing      "right-handed" to tilthing "left-handed" - often . .      . say, every three or four minutes.    </p>    <p>      Once you get good at the job, you may be able to completely      work a 4' X 30' bed in 45 minutes . . . <em>if</em> you've      got fine, loamy soil. In the clay soil of our research      gardens, it can take two hours or more to work up the same      size area. Of course, how finely you tilth the soil will      depend on the crop you're planning to raise: Brassicas      actually prefer firm soil, but carrots and other root crops      appreciate the finest-particled earth you can give them.    </p>    <p>      That's about all we can tell you; you'll have to learn the      finer points through experimentation and practice. There's      no doubt that tilthing is work (head gardener Susan Glaese      says, "It's the only chest-building exercise I've seen that      doesn't come from the back of a magazine"). But once you've      got the knack of doing it correctly, it's quite bearable,      even enjoyable, work.    </p>
