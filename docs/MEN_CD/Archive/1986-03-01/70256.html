                <p>      <em>A pond adds both beauty and value to a country home.      Here's a way to create one without resorting to expensive      and soil-damaging heavy equipment.</em>    </p>          <h2 id="subtitle">A Stream Pond That Carves [and Cleans]      Itself</h2>      <h5 id="byline">by Tim Matson</h5>        <p>      One summer I swam in a stream pond in the second curve of      an oxbow in Abbott Brook. The flow had chiseled into the      bank, sweeping out a 20-foot bowl, then doubled back where      the roots of a poplar grove held the bank together.      Rebounding sediment had settled into a sandy beach on the      shallow bank. You could swim all day against the current      and never get anywhere.    </p>    <p>      This stretch of brook with its whirly-pit was one of the      brightest lures when the surrounding land was deeded to a      young family from California. Lee Ann and Mike turned      salvage from an old carriage house into a post-and-beam      saltbox near the bank and counted on the pond for household      water and summer baths. One summer afternoon, with some      help from their daughter Heather, they laid up a stone dam      to deepen the basin to six feet. They chopped down a poplar      to bridge the brook - great for hanging by the knees      in the free current. But with autumn rains came a tide of      silt that filled the little pond, and ice and spring      snowmelt crumpled the dam.    </p>    <p>      Just south, Dave and Victoria built a silo house out of      dismantled Army barracks trucked from Michigan. It was a      memorial to thrift and sixties sentiment. Really monumental      were their cellar sauna and front-yard pond. The sauna was      a real beauty. Clear cedar boards lined the interior, and      two racks of slatted benches crisscrossed the room. A      mail-order sheet-metal stove burned with cheery red cheeks      near a knee-high window that peered over a rocky brook.      During tower construction David and Tor had let the brook      run loose. With the house together, they looked around and      decided to make a pond. They built a stone dam and shoveled      silt out of the basin. The dam was laid up loose enough to      pass the flow and contain a pool. It filled deep enough to      inspire David, after a midnight sauna, to climb the ladder      to his tower roof and leap for the dark pond below. But      spring came with runoff that punched out the dam and swept      in a load of silt - a nuisance for the rest of us and      potentially fatal for David.    </p>    <p>      So a ritual grew in the summer. Neighbors gathered at      different stream ponds for dam repair and silt shoveling.      Given a good blend of hot sun and cold beer it was OK,      until you got your toe crunched. I began to ponder a better      solution. I found it in a 15-year-old illustrated bulletin      published by the New York State Conservation Department.      "The stream pond," I read, "must lie <em>below</em> the      dam." It's simply geology: Pools form naturally in the wake      of a waterfall.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/098-042-i2.jpg" alt="098-042-i2.jpg" width="155" height="250" />    <p class="caption">      [1] Dig two trenches across the stream bottom and four feet      into the banks.

It will flow ice free two or three      months longer than a still-water pond.    </p></div>    </div>    <p>      "Log pyramid pool digger" is the title the conservationists      tagged their pond-making method, and it wasn't long before      I saw how smoothly it worked. With my neighbors, Blake and      Aletta, who live on the brink of Podunk Brook, I raised a      barrier of logs and stones across the water, triggering a      waterfall that carved out a pond. Now it flows like a      self-propelled excavator and even sweeps itself clean every      spring - a sorcerer's impoundment. We just call it      the <em>digger pond</em> .    </p>    <p>      A sidehill pond is a bath; the digger is a whirlpool.      Still-water ponds lie under ice half the year; the churning      digger pond freezes for two or three of winter's coldest      months, at most. The digger attracts native trout without      trapping them, simultaneously stirring up a richly aerated      pond suitable for cage-culturing fish.    </p>    <p>      As with all forms of pond making, success depends on      tapping natural advantages of terrain. A stream has a way      of hinting at the best site for a digger pond: a hollow      that could be enlarged, a slow shallow flow between stable      banks, or a pool already forming under existing falls.      Banks should be at least three or four feet high and sites      prone to flooding avoided.    </p>    <p>      The size of the digger basin will be limited by the breadth      of the stream, so look for a site wide enough to let you      stretch out - "Ample and large, that the arms spread      abroad might not be hurt," as Cicero described the ideal      pond - but not so wide that finding dam materials is      difficult, or where watershed runoff will overload the      structure. A stream spanning ten to twenty feet, catching      runoff from less than ten square miles, works well. Dam      materials should be close at hand. Our digger dam was built      with trees felled at the site. Round timbers about a foot      in diameter make the best structure, with hemlock, cedar,      and tamarack topping the list. For longest durability the      bark should be peeled. Stones can be used in place of      timber, although the dam will be less effective, if quicker      to build.    </p>    <p>      Dams are subject to a trio of wracking forces: sliding,      crushing, and overthrow. A strong foundation will prevent      sliding, and a tight structure will avert crushing and      overthrow. The best foundation for a digger is bedrock or      solid bottom. A base of sand or mud will undermine the      structure. If you fail to find a solid base, it may be      possible to create one using an old loggers' technique for      building stream-driven dams: Drive a row of wooden pilings      into the streambed to keep the bottom from washing away and      to form a base to which the sills of the dam can be bolted.    </p>    <p>      To be most effective, the dam should rest on a pair of sill      timbers that traverse the stream, lying flat on the bottom      and butted into the banks. To insure that the dam does not      slide, an elaborate anchoring technique was suggested in      the N.Y. State Bulletin. A trench is excavated about two      feet wide, four feet deep into the banks, the base level      with the streambed. If stream water is high, it may be      diverted to one side by temporary dams made of logs or      stone. Here on the Podunk, to save labor and comply with      Vermont regulations against stream course alteration, we      found low-water construction best.    </p>    <p>      Drift bolts are used to pin the twin timbers to the      streambed, and an additional log is entrenched about four      feet upstream. The sills are then tied to this anchor log      with galvanized poultry wire. The pond maker drills      one-inch holes every six feet or so in parallel sills and      pins down the base by sledge hammering three-quarter-inch      concrete reinforcing bars through the logs, deep into the      streambed. Six-foot lengths of rebar sunk five feet deep      leave a foot to crimp over and hold down the sills.      Obstructions in the streambed may be sidestepped by      repositioning the bolts or backfilling and weighing down      the butt ends of the sills. Additional drift bolts should      be pinned two feet to either side of the joints. The      six-inch anchor log is then entrenched about four feet      upstream of the sills, flush with the streamed, and      drift-bolted or otherwise firmly secured. The chicken wire      is then used to tie the sills to the anchor, as well as      create a ramp to sweep water over the dam. The wire is      blanketed over the width of the stream and secured to the      anchor log and sills with galvanized nails or staples. Fine      brush is layered over the wire and anchored with flat      stones to complete the seal. Finally, two logs of similar      girth are fitted into the sill crevice and spiked at the      outside ends, leaving a midstream gap of a foot or two. The      central opening is then cut wide enough to pass the entire      flow of the stream into the center of the pond. This      trimming should be synchronized with a run of low water.      Additional spikes are added to secure the logs, with an      eight-inch board nailed over the exposed sills to cleat the      wire.    </p>    <p>      Of course, nothing in the world of natural stream ponds      resembles such a structure. Aletta, Blake, and I didn't      hesitate to assemble a simpler digger dam. We bridged the      stream with a pair of balsam timbers, anchored the butts      with stones, and backfilled the upstream side with more      stones. By adding a rim of stones at the downstream end of      the pond, Aletta made sure than even in a drought the pond      spans 15 feet with four or five feet of water.    </p>    <p>      Blake and Aletta are guaranteed a regular catch from the      pond in season. And since the pond is cupped at the head of      a stretch of water that flows dead south, it gathers direct      and reflected sun. Last summer Blake built a sauna at the      northwest end of the pond, taking advantage of the sun to      supplement the sauna's wood fire. Through all but the      deepest freezes the pond stays clear for sauna baths. If      their household water freezes up, the digger pond holds a      reservoir of emergency water.    </p>    <p>      "It looks like a backwards dammed pond," Blake said awhile      back, soaking under the falls between saunas. "But it sure      does work."    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Before altering the course or flow of      any stream, check with your local water resources agency to      be sure you'll be in compliance with the appropriate stream      modification laws.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>This article is reprinted by permission of The      Countryman Press from</em> Earth Ponds: The Country Pond      Maker's Guide <em>, copyright 1982 by Tim Matson.</em>    </p>
