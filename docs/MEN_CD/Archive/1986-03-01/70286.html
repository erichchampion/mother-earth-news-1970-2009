                    <p>      <em>When you're not quite up to snuff, give Mother Nature a      chance to clear things up before you run to the      pharmacy.</em>    </p>        <p>      Even the healthiest bodies occasionally get out of whack.      Everyday ailments-colds, sore throats, headaches, sinus      trouble, constipation-afflict us all from time to      time. And while there are lots of nonprescription remedies      available, many have drawbacks. Some medications-such      as nasal sprays and laxative-scan be addictive.      Others (cold preparations, for example) contain      combinations of ingredients designed to treat a whole range      of symptoms that you may or may not have. A few are      considered flat-out ineffective by the FDA. And a great      many have undesirable side effects!    </p>    <p>      But you don't have to haunt the aisles of your corner      drugstore the next time you're under the weather. Check out      your produce bin instead! Fresh vegetables-as well as      fruits and grains-have long-established medicinal      properties that can alleviate the symptoms of minor      illnesses.    </p>    <p>      I've put together a few concoctions that are good for what      ails you. And rather than side effects, my natural      medicines have side benefits,. They provide good eating and      sound nutrition.    </p>    <p>      Do you feel a cold coming on? Get your vitamin C from the      rose hips in Super-C Soup or from Ascorbic Acid Ice Milk.      Suffering from a cough or a sandpaper throat? The soothing      honey-and-garlic blend I call Nature's Penicillin has mild      antiseptic, expectorant, and (some argue) antibiotic      qualities. Sinuses acting up? Sgt. Pepper's Sinus Cure will      help unclog your stuffy nose. Headache? Down a few Almond      Aspirins; they're full of salicylates-as in salicylic      acid, commonly known as aspirin-and they contribute      substantial calcium, potassium, and B vitamins to your achy      body. Constipated? I'd suggest Ex-Flax or Fruit 'N' Bran      Balls. You say you're just feeling generally down and out?      Try one of my high-vitamin pick-me-ups. Parsley Salad is      packed with vitamins A and C and has generous amounts of      calcium, potassium, and fiber . . . and B-8 Juice      contributes goodly portions of A and C along with its dose      of B vitamins.    </p>    <h3>      Parsley Salad    </h3>        <p>      1 medium bunch parsley<br />      1 small clove garlic<br />      2 tablespoons olive oil<br />      1 /2 lemon    </p>    <p>      Trim stems off parsley and cut it into bite-sized pieces      before placing the greens on two salad plates. Chop garlic      very fine and sprinkle it over parsley, then dribble one      tablespoon of oil and the juice of 1/4 lemon over each      plate. Stir lightly.    </p>    <p>      Each serving contains 150 calories, 5,102 IU vitamin A, 113      mg vitamin C, 470 mg potassium, 38 mg calcium, 2 g protein,      7 g carbohydrate, 14 g fat.    </p>    <h3>      Ascorbic Acid Ice Milk    </h3>    <p>      8 ounces pitted dates<br />      1 /2 cup boiling water<br />      1 cup cold water<br />      1 cup milk or yogurt<br />      1 teaspoon grated lemon peel<br />      4 teaspoons lemon juice<br />      1 to 2 teaspoons powdered vitamin C    </p>    <p>      Blend dates and boiling water until dates are pureed. Stir      in other ingredients and freeze until almost firm. Beat the      mixture until smooth, then turn it into a 9" X 9" X 2" pan.      Cover the pan with plastic wrap and freeze until firm.    </p>    <p>      The recipe contains 715 calories, 236 mg vitamin C, 110 IU      vitamin A, 430 mg calcium, 1,859 mg potassium, 14 g      protein, 179 g carbohydrate, and 1 g fat. Note: Figures are      based on skim milk; using whole milk or yogurt would change      the calorie and fat content.    </p>    <h3>      Sgt. Pepper's Sinus Cure    </h3>    <p>      1 cup fresh orange juice<br />      1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      1/2 green pepper    </p>    <p>      Blend all ingredients. The recipe contains 114 calories,      205 mg vitamin C, 587 mg potassium, 2 g protein, 26 g      carbohydrate.    </p>    <h3>      Ex-Flax    </h3>    <p>      1 cup pitted prunes<br />      1 cup raisins<br />      1 cup finely grated carrot<br />      3 teaspoons flax seeds    </p>    <p>      Put all of the ingredients through a food grinder (add a      little boiling water if they stick). Form the mixture into      tiny balls and roll them in powdered carob or powdered milk      spiked with cinnamon. Chill, and take three or four a day      as needed.    </p>    <p>      Note: Be sure to drink plenty of water with this (or any      similar) laxative, or it may have an opposite effect to the      one desired.    </p>    <p>      The recipe contains 780 calories, 215 mg calcium, 10 mg      iron, 14,300 IU vitamin A, 99 mg sodium,.34 mg B 1 , .39 mg      B 2 , 3.5 mg niacin, 8 g protein, 206 g carbohydrate, and 1      g fat.    </p>    <h3>      Super-C Soup    </h3>    <p>      1 cup seedless rose hips<br />      1 quart water<br />      2 tablespoons honey (or more for a sweeter soup)<br />      1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon yogurt or sour cream    </p>    <p>      Soak rose hips in water overnight. The next day, simmer the      rose hips, water, honey, and cinnamon for 30 minutes.      Remove from the heat, cool slightly, and whirl in a blender      until smooth. Chill and serve with yogurt or sour cream, if      desired.    </p>    <p>      This recipe, without the yogurt or sour cream topping,      contains 150 calories and 5,600 mg vitamin C. Note: When      the soup is cooked, it will lose some of the vitamin C      content listed above. To minimize the loss, don't simmer      the soup longer than 1/2 hour, and keep a lid on the      saucepan.    </p>    <h3>      Nature's Penicillin    </h3>    <p>      24 cloves of garlic raw honey    </p>    <p>      Peel the garlic cloves and put them in a medium-sized jar;      add honey a little at a time over a couple of days until      the jar is full, then set it in a sunlit window until the      garlic has turned somewhat opaque and the honey tastes      strongly of garlic. Take a teaspoon every few hours or      whenever necessary.    </p>    <p>      One tablespoon contains 70 calories and 36 g carbohydrate.    </p>    <h3>      B-8 Juice    </h3>    <p>      2 cups vegetable cocktail juice<br />      1 to 3 teaspoons nutritional yeast    </p>    <p>      Process ingredients in the blender until smooth. (Note:      Some brands of yeast taste better than others; shop around      for the one that you prefer.) Variations: For additional      nutrition, add kelp, vitamin C powder, or dry vegetable      flakes.    </p>    <p>      Recipe contains 90 calories, 2,500 IU vitamin A, 30 mg      vitamin C, 1.6 mg B 1 , 1.6 mg B 2 , 1.6 mg B 6 , 1.3 mcg B      12 , 6 g protein, 19 g carbohydrate.    </p>    <h3>      Almond Aspirins    </h3>    <p>      1 cup honey<br />      3/4 cup whole raw almonds<br />      1/2 to 1 cup unsweetened coconut (as needed)    </p>    <p>      Heat and stir the honey until it reaches the firm ball      stage (240Â°F). Using tongs, quickly dip each nut into      the hot honey, and then into the coconut. Set aside on wax      paper until dry.    </p>    <p>      This recipe contains 1,839 calories, 253 mg calcium, 1,093      mg potassium, .9 mg B 2 , 3 mg niacin, 21 g protein, 583 g      carbohydrate, 79 g fat (62 g saturated fat).    </p>    <h3>      Fruit 'n' Bran Balls    </h3>    <p>      1 cup dried, pitted prunes<br />      1 cup seedless raisins<br />      1 cup dried black figs<br />      2 teaspoons wheat bran    </p>    <p>      Mix fruits in a bowl, then put through a food grinder twice      (add a little boiling water if the ingredients stick). Form      the mixture into walnut-sized balls, roll in wheat germ,      and store in the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      <em>Note:</em> As with Ex Flax, be sure to drink plenty of      water with this laxative, or it may have an opposite effect      to the one desired.    </p>    <p>      This recipe contains 1,292 calories, 526 mg calcium, 18 mg      iron, 2,330 IU vitamin A, 6.7 g protein, 334 g      carbohydrate, and 3.4 g fat.    </p>
