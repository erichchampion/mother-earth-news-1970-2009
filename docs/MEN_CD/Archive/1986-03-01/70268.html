                <p>      <em>After a dozen decades of overgrazing and overcropping,      our western agricultural lands-both public and private-are      in real trouble. But help may be on the way in the form of      . . .</em>    </p>        <p>      For a good many months, the media have kept us painfully      abreast of the starvation, death, and general misery being      visited upon the African continent - misery arising,      in part, from desertification of the land as a result of      years of overgrazing and poor farming practices.      Unfortunately, those same newspapers, magazines, and      television stations have been slow to point out that the      same tragedy could happen <em>here</em> .    </p>        <p>      Of course, if you know about the Depression-era dust bowl,      then you know that a soil crisis has already occurred in      the Great Plains region of the U.S. It could certainly      happen again, and it could be much worse the next time. In      fact, some climatologists and soil scientists not only      believe that America <em>could</em> suffer a far more      devastating replay of the dust bowl in the not-too-distant      future, but maintain that we undoubtedly <em>will</em> if      the present trend toward desertification of farmland and      pastureland in the semiarid West - especially on the      dreadfully overgrazed and chemically abused public lands      administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) -      isn't halted <em>and</em> reversed in the near future.    </p>    <p>      It's been said that a country's long-term strength can best      be gauged by the health of its topsoil, and it's true; once      those precious few inches of decomposed organic matter that      directly or indirectly sustain all life on this planet are      cow-chewed, plowed, and herbicided into sterility, then      washed and blown away because there's no longer any      vegetation to hold the soil in place, the American West      could become another Ethiopia, capable of sustaining life      only through the compassionate generosity of those who have      better guarded their legacy of arable land.    </p>    <p>      For that reason, many environmentally concerned soil      scientists feel that the present rapid rate of degradation      and loss of topsoil worldwide is the single most formidable      threat facing humanity today, with the present misery in      Africa being only the leading edge of what's likely to      follow.    </p>    <p>      And while there's a limit to what can be done to help      Africa, it's not too late to halt the trend toward      desertification here at home. Consequently, the staff of      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> is vitally interested in spreading      the word about natural, nontoxic approaches to conserving      (and restoring) the topsoil and increasing the sustainable      productivity of our land.    </p>    <p>      In MOTHER N0. 91, for example, we presented an article      detailing Allan Savory's controversial Holistic Resource      Management (HRM) theory. In brief review, Mr. Savory has      gathered a convincing amount of empirical evidence      indicating that the creeping desertification we see today      in the American West is a direct result of a century and      more of the relentless overgrazing of cattle and sheep. But      that's hardly late-breaking news; environmentalists have      long lobbied for a reduction of the number of animals being      grazed on the western public lands. What is new and      different about Savory's HRM theory is the idea that you      can actually <em>increase</em> the number of animals being      grazed on a particular range while simultaneously improving      its soil and vegetation.    </p>    <p>      How? By fencing the expansive western rangelands into      numerous smaller pastures and rotating the stock from one      cell to another according to a carefully formulated      schedule. Thus, says Savory, the animals will be forced to      graze <em>all</em> the edible vegetation in each area or go      hungry - rather than having the luxury of overgrazing      only a few favored plants while neglecting less tasty but      nevertheless wholesome foods, as they'll invariably do if      given the run of the range.    </p>    <p>      In theory (and quite possibly in practice), HRM produces      nonselective grazing, the soil benefits from the pocking of      the animals' hooves (which form rain and seed traps), and      - since the stock is confined to a small area at a      time while the remaining pasture is fenced out of bounds      - the land and grass are given much-needed breaks      between periods of intensive grazing . . . breaks that      allow the topsoil to, in effect, heal itself.    </p>    <p>      But HRM isn't without problems, especially when the theory      is applied to <em>public</em> grasslands. And chief among      these pitfalls is the method's requirement that we lace      even <em>more</em> fences across the range - fences      that disrupt the feeding, watering, and seasonal migration      of large wild animals such as pronghorn antelope, elk, and      deer; fences that lie like rusty scars on the face of the      land to mar its natural beauty.    </p>    <h3>      FOUR AIR-EARTH INTERFACE PROCESSES    </h3>    <p>      <strong>(Land imprinting stabilizes the soil surface with      funnel-shaped depressions that maintain high infiltration      rates and reverse desertification.)</strong>    </p>    <div class="sidebar">    <div class="image">    <p class="caption"><strong>      1.

(And such lands, remember, were set aside for the benefit      of <em>all</em> Americans - not just those who would      use them as a means of making a living.)    </p>    <p>      Surely there must be ways of providing the beneficial      effects of hoof depressions - which were historically      tromped into the soil by migrating herds of wild bison      - that are superior to fencing the land to death . .      . and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil scientist      Dr. Robert Dixon may have found one of them. Dixon calls      his invention the land imprinter, and it's really nothing      more than a large metal drum embossed with the equivalent      of a herd of steel hooves arranged in purposefully random      patterns.    </p>    <p>      As the land imprinter is pulled along behind a tractor, the      angular "hooves" on the drum make funnel-shaped depressions      in the earth - depressions designed to form perfect      seedbeds, trap water, increase soil aeration, and crush      competitive vegetation into the ground, where it will serve      as mulch and gradually decompose to become natural      fertilizer for the grass, grain, or other seed that can be      dropped automatically into the imprints via a broadcast      seeder attached to the imprinter.    </p>    <p>      The Dixon land imprinter promises dramatic rangeland      improvement without more fences, without large herds of      livestock tromping down stream banks and polluting the      watering areas essential to the survival of wildlife, and      without poisoning the soil and water with herbicides such      as tebuthiuron in an effort to destroy mesquite and other      "problem" (that is, competitive) vegetation.    </p>    <p>      Not unexpectedly, Robert Dixon's progressive,      nontraditional, antiherbicidal views were received with      skepticism by some members of the government bureaucracy      for which he worked until recently as a soil scientist      specializing in arid lands recovery. After all, that very      bureaucracy endorses and even encourages the use of      bulldozing, burning, and highly questionable herbicides! As      a result of this policy-versus-progress conflict, Dixon      took an early retirement from the USDA this past October to      set up a private, not-for-profit organization he's calling      The Imprinting Foundation.    </p>    <p>      But in contrast to the doubts of some of his former USDA      associates concerning the viability of land imprinting, the      majority of the <em>ranchers and farmers</em> who have      tried Dixon's invention swear by it, claiming the imprinter      has returned their semidesertified land to productive      savannah after the traditional, USDA-sponsored methods were      tried and had failed . . . and it has done so quite      economically by comparison.    </p>    <p>      So how does one come by a Dixon land imprinter? You can buy      one, but it won't be cheap: Laird Welding &      Manufacturing Works of Merced, California,      custom-manufactures huge imprinters for use on large      ranches and farms . . . at $8,000 to $10,000 each. That's a      heck of a lot of money - though perhaps not so much      to a big-time rancher or farmer who's accustomed to laying      out ten times that amount and more for various single items      of heavy equipment, or nearly twice that amount for a new 4      X 4 pickup truck, and who's faced with losing it all to      impending desertification. And $8,000 to $10,000 is      certainly not too much - a drop in the bucket -      for the BLM to pay for an item of essential equipment that      will virtually never wear out.    </p>    <p>      But it certainly is too much for the average homesteader or      arid-lands gardener to pay to rejuvenate a half-acre      pasture, to render tired, dry soil suitable for a small      garden, or to get a patch of grass growing in the parched      front yard. But Dixon recognized this need for small-scale,      inexpensive land imprinting and designed a single-hooved      model that he calls the <em>hand</em> imprinter. This      inexpensive tool can be fabricated at home with the help of      a plan-and-instruction packet available at cost from The      Imprinting Foundation (see the accompanying sidebar for      details), and - in some instances - virtually      does away with the need for tilling and plowing.      Additionally, Dixon has designed intermediate-size,      drum-type imprinters suitable for pulling behind small      tractors or draft animals.    </p>    <p>      While we at THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> don't claim to be experts      in arid-lands agriculture, our western-states editorial      representative does follow this vitally important subject      closely, and we attempt to keep an open mind concerning the      various organic, holistic proposals for regenerating      western America's depleted topsoil and returning it to      productive status. Furthermore, it appears to us that the      federal government's long-standing policy of encouraging      the deficit overgrazing of our public lands by offering      ridiculously low grazing fees and granting overgenerous      grazing allotments, its poor enforcement of land-use      regulations, its direct and indirect destruction of      publicly owned indigenous wildlife in favor of privately      owned cattle and sheep, and its preference for slash, burn,      and poison techniques over a commonsense reduction of      grazing allotments (all of this to protect what amounts to      less than 4% of the country's total production of beef!),      are undemocratic, uneconomical, counterproductive, and      <em>just plain wrong</em> .    </p>    <p>      And while Allan Savory's Holistic Resource Management has      proven effective on private and Indian tribal ranchlands      and could also be a valuable tool for landowners who graze      a small number of animals on limited pasture, we can't      endorse increased fencing and heavier grazing pressure on      America's already overworked and overfenced public lands.    </p>    <p>      That leaves Robert Dixon's land-imprinting system -      indenting the soil with mechanical hooves, then seeding,      rest, growth, and finally a return to farming or grazing      within the restraints of sensible moderation - as the      most promising method we've yet seen for restoring and      improving the depleted grasslands of the semiarid American      West. Like Holistic Resource Management, land imprinting is      no panacea - but it certainly appears to be a long      stride in the right direction.    </p>    <p>      For additional information concerning land imprinting and      the various designs of Dixon land imprinters - or for      answers to specific questions - write to Robert Dixon      at The Imprinting Foundation, 1231 E. Big Rock Rd., Tucson,      AZ 85718 (and please include a stamped, self-addressed,      legal-size envelope to help defray the foundation's costs).    </p>    <p>      <em>If you live in the semiarid western United States and      would like to improve the water-holding ability, aeration,      and fertility of your garden, lawn, or small pasture, try      this inexpensive new tool.</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE DIXON HAND IMPRINTER    </h3>        <p>      The accompanying article discusses the various ways a      multi-ton, drum-type land imprinter may be able to benefit      arid-lands farmers and ranchers who measure their holdings      in square miles rather than acres . . . but what earthly      good could such a monstrous device be to the backyard      gardener, or to the family who'd like to grow a bit of      grass on the patch of desert that passes for a lawn?    </p>    <p>      Absolutely none, of course.    </p>    <p>      Rather, what these folks need - says land imprinter      inventor Robert Dixon - isn't the massive, drum-type      unit, but the hand imprinter . . . a foot-powered tool      designed to do exactly what the big land imprinter does,      only on a greatly reduced scale.    </p>        <p>      With a hand imprinter, according to Dixon, you can forget      about doing all that traditional backbreaking tilling and      turning of soil; instead, you simply work through your      garden area or yard with the shovel-like imprinting tool in      hand, pausing every little bit to step down on the foot      plate that drives the imprinting head into the soil to form      a funnel-shaped depression. When you're done with the      imprinting you make a second pass - this time      dropping seed into the depressions created by the imprinter      - then a third to sprinkle a little soil over the      seed in the bottom of each imprint . . . and you're ready      to sit back and wait for rain (or break out the garden hose      if you can afford the water).    </p>    <p>      That's about all there is to tell about the Dixon hand      imprinter without getting unnecessarily technical -      except how to acquire one.    </p>    <p>      A newly formed, nonprofit organization called The      Imprinting Foundation (1231 E. Big Rock Rd., Tucson, AZ      85718) will soon be offering hand imprinters by mail order      for the cost of their manufacture and shipping (around $25;      the exact price has yet to be determined at press time). Or      you can fabricate your own hand imprinter (some light-duty      welding is required) at a materials cost of around $15,      with the help of a detailed plan-and-instruction packet Dr.      Dixon has offered to provide for the foundation's $5      printing and mailing costs - to any MOTHER -      reader who requests it.    </p>
