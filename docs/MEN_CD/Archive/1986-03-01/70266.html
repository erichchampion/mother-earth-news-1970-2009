                <p>      <em>For nearly two decades now, an enterprising Colorado      ranching family has been demonstrating that raising wild      ungulates for the commercial market is more fun than      herding cattle or sheep, and can also be an extremely      profitable venture.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by David Petersen    </h5>        <p>      At the age of 52, Lou Wyman is everything a half-century of      cowboy movies has conditioned us to expect a lifelong      western rancher to be-strong, independent, even ruggedly      handsome in a Clark Gable sort of way.    </p>    <p>      And the Wyman ranch - 10,000 acres of lightly      timbered Rocky Mountain foothill country perched at 7,000      feet in northwestern Colorado - would also satisfy      popular notions as to what such an operation should look      like . . . with a cattle-guarded entrance gate located      several miles from the nearest paved road; a traditional      single-story ranch house furnished with age-darkened      antiques; a huge barn with hayloft, its roof sagging with      the memory of decades of heavy snows; a log bunkhouse, its      interior decorated with hunting trophies and warmed by a      cavernous stone fireplace; sprawling pastures watered by a      meandering fork of the nearby Yampa River; and a generous      assortment of corrals, narrowing chutes, loading ramps,      squeezes, and sundry outbuildings - all Wyman-built      from locally harvested logs and home-milled lumber.    </p>    <p>      In fact, about the only thing missing from this otherwise      classic Western American Gothic is a lazing herd of lowing      cattle. But that's OK, because Lou and Paula Wyman ranch      critters that are a heck of a lot more interesting and      aesthetic than a bunch of gutbulged cows; the Wyman ranch      supports, depending on the season, from 200 to 300 head of      wapiti . . . the regal Rocky Mountain elk.    </p>    <h3>      ELK RANCHING AT A GLANCE    </h3>        <p>      With the help of a single hired hand, Wyman maintains his      elk in three separate herds. The first group consists of 60      or so head pastured near ranch headquarters. These animals      are about as close to being domesticated as elk are ever      likely to come: When Wyman steers his dilapidated flatbed      truck into the big, white pasture early each winter morning      to distribute the daily supplemental feeding of alfalfa or      grass hay, the pampered wapiti fall in behind the motorized      feed wagon as obediently as a platoon of army recruits      forming up in front of a chow hall.    </p>    <p>      The second herd - pastured in a more remote area      - is wilder, has the run of a good deal more country,      and will line out for yon side of the nearest hill at the      slightest provocation. The third and largest herd -      over 100 adult animals plus their offspring - has      close to 1,000 rolling, aspen-timbered acres upon which to      roam and graze, and is, in a practical sense, wild.    </p>        <p>      In addition to wholesaling fresh, organically grown elk      meat and distributing their own brand of preservative-free      elk jerky, the Wymans have developed a marketing strategy      that includes selling live animals, helping to satisfy the      oriental craving for an aphrodisiac derived from elk antler      in velvet, and outfitting and guiding a few hunters each      fall, both on the nearby National Forest and Bureau of Land      Management lands and in the hinterlands of the sprawling      ranch.    </p>    <h3>      ELK IMPRESARIO    </h3>    <p>      As a matter of fact, hunting is what got Lou Wyman into the      elk ranching business in the first place.    </p>    <p>      For years, Lou had supplemented his ranching income (his      family ran some 5,000 head of sheep and cattle) by guiding      big-game hunters each fall. He enjoyed guiding, and he      enjoyed its monetary rewards. What he <em>didn't</em> enjoy      was the shortness of the annual hunting season-averaging      just a couple of weeks. Consequently, Wyman began casting      about for a way to legally extend the local elkhunting      season.    </p>    <p>      In 1968 - after determining that the state of      Colorado had no regulations restricting the private      ownership of elk (he would later help write the first of      such laws) - Wyman purchased 50 head of wapiti from      the Denver Zoo, bought a few more from private sources here      and there, and established the largest privately owned elk      herd in Colorado. After enclosing 1,500 acres of the ranch      with eight-foot-high, "elephant-proof" V-mesh fence, and      working out the legalities of operating a game preserve,      Wyman was ready to begin hosting paying hunters -      anytime he chose.    </p>    <p>      That was 18 years ago. Today, the Wymans continue to take      on a score or so hunters annually - hunters who are      both able and willing to pay a premium price to hunt a      premium herd that boasts a remarkably high percentage of      royal bulls (males having at least six tines, or points,      protruding from each main antler beam). However, over the      past few years, the Wymans have gradually deemphasized the      hunting aspect of their business and have come to depend      more on the sale of meat and antlers as their primary      source of income.    </p>    <h3>      MEATY PRODUCTS    </h3>    <p>      With a base herd numbering 200 mature elk and a calf yield      of 80% a year, the Wymans can harvest more than 100 animals      annually. Of this number, about 20 of the largest bulls are      taken by hunters, and 6 or 8 cows and young bulls are sold      each month for meat. (Rather than do the processing      themselves, the Wymans truck their elk to a meat-packing      plant in nearby Craig, where the animals are slaughtered      under the official eye of a U.S. Department of Agriculture      inspector.)    </p>    <p>      The average adult elk - 600 pounds or so on the hoof      - will produce about 350 pounds of butchered meat      that sells, wholesale, for $4.00 per pound. After deducting      transportation and butchering costs, the Wymans are left      with around $900.00 net profit per animal.    </p>    <p>      While the prime cuts are air-freighted fresh to wholesale      restaurant suppliers catering to exclusive eateries, a      portion of each animal is shipped to a plant in Utah, where      the meat is processed (chopped and formed) into nitrate-      and nitrite-free jerky sticks. The jerky is then packaged      in plastic tubs of 30 sticks each, labeled, and shipped      back to the ranch. From there, Lou and Paula distribute the      product to various retail outlets around the country (and      as far away as Greenland) via a network of wholesalers.    </p>    <h3>      RACKING UP PROFITS    </h3>    <p>      Most oriental cultures still rely heavily on herbal      medicines and other elixirs, and one of the more revered of      these is a purported aphrodisiac made from powdered deer,      caribou, or elk antler. While just about any antler will do      for the more budget-priced of such elixirs, elk antler is      demanded by the discerning, and elk antler <em>in      velvet</em> is considered to be the Mercedes of aphrodisiac      ingredients. And since Korea, China, and the other big      consumers of such antler-based potions all suffer a severe      shortage of elk, the U.S. has come to be a leading      supplier. However, many Americans object to such dealings      on the basis that it's cruel to rob a wild ungulate of its      antlers.    </p>    <p>      The Wymans have given a lot of thought to that criticism,      but in the final analysis can see nothing cruel or morally      wrong in harvesting the antlers of about half of their      mature bulls each year, especially when those antlers are      worth $45.00 per pound and the head of an average adult      bull is adorned with 10 to 15 pounds of the valuable bone .      . . which will drop off in March anyhow and - in the      dried state - be worth only about $6.00 a pound.    </p>    <p>      When the time arrives to harvest antlers - usually      midsummer - the Wymans herd the selected bulls into a      large corral that vents into a narrowing chute, which leads      in turn into a cattle squeeze that Lou has modified      especially for handling elk. As an animal enters the      squeeze, a lever trips and a gate drops down in the rear,      preventing the bull from backing up. At the same time, the      floor drops out so that the wapiti's body is squeezed by      its own weight down into the V-shaped contraption and held      firmly but gently in place. Finally, the bull's head is      immobilized in a snug collar so that the antlers can be cut      without fear of several hundred pounds of uncooperative      beast thrashing about and possibly harming either itself or      Wyman.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the antlers have been removed, Lou caps the      stumps with paraffin to stop the bleeding, prevent      infection, and provide a degree of protection against      injury until the wound heals over (which takes only a few      days). And since bull elk enjoy fighting during the fall      rutting season, Wyman often leaves their brow tines -      the two bottom, downward-slanting antler points - in      place as eye protection.    </p>    <p>      The dehorning operation takes a few minutes and apparently      causes little, if any, pain to the animals. (The Wymans      base this assumption on the fact that elk are highly vocal      creatures that don't hesitate to "cry" when frightened or      in pain - and the bulls never utter a sound before,      during, or after having their antlers trimmed.)    </p>    <h3>      GIVE ME A HOME WHERE THE WAPITI ROAM    </h3>    <p>      While ranching indigenous ungulates has long been an      established business in Africa, it's still a relative      oddity here in the U.S., where the meat of wild game is      considered by the nonhunting majority to be something less      than desirable. Of course, ignorance breeds contempt, and      many folks who think they dislike wild meat simply because      they've never tried it (as well as those who've eaten      hunter-killed game that's been improperly handled or      prepared) are in for a delightful surprise if they ever get      an opportunity to lay a lip over a lean, organic,      Wyman-grown elk roast.    </p>    <p>      The Wyman Elk Ranch is working proof that big-game ranching      can be as financially sound a venture as raising more      traditional livestock such as cattle or sheep, and Lou and      Paula Wyman enthusiastically testify that it's also a darn      sight more fun.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Though they normally market their elk      jerky in bulk lots through wholesale distributors, the      Wymans have agreed to make the product available directly      to hungry (or merely curious) MOTHER readers. To order a      tub containing 30 sticks of elk jerky, send $18 (postage      paid anywhere in the continental U.S.) to Wyman Elk Ranch,      P.O. Box 278, Craig, CO 81626.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Small-Scale Elk Ranching: A Hopeful's Primer    </h3>    <p>      Although Lou Wyman runs 200 to 300 head of elk on a      sprawling 1,500 acres of prime western ranchland, he firmly      believes that just about anyone with a few acres of good      pasture, and the wherewithal to erect a strong fence and      purchase a small starter herd, can make wapiti ranching      pay. In fact, he feels that a person with just a few head      of elk can realize a profit that wouldn't be possible with      the same number of cattle pastured on the same acreage.    </p>    <h3>      GETTING STARTED    </h3>    <p>      Assuming that you're already equipped with the necessities      of tending large livestock - sufficient acreage, hay      barn, feeding and watering facilities - the biggest      expense involved in converting to an elk operation will be      fencing. Elk can, and often do, leap over or bull right      through standard barbed wire. The Wymans use an      eight-foot-high, V-mesh fence stretched between strong,      deepset poles. At current prices, such a fence -      assuming you purchase all the materials at retail and hire      the work done - could run as much as $5.00 per foot.      However, by utilizing the high-tensile-strength,      single-strand fencing that's recently become available, and      by doing the work yourself, that per foot cost can be      reduced considerably.    </p>    <p>      With a strong, high fence in place, you'll need some elk      - which can be purchased from the Wyman ranch, from      similar operations around the country, or at the annual      wild animal auctions held at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, each      fall and at Chamberlain, South Dakota, in late winter. The      minimum practical starter herd would consist of one bull      and a few cows. With an 80% annual calf return, your herd      should grow quickly, and once you have 12 adults and their      spring calves, you can begin harvesting an animal per month      without decreasing the size of your base herd.    </p>    <h3>      ELK ECONOMICS    </h3>    <p>      The following prices are representative of what elk sold      for at the Cape Girardeau auction in 1985, and are close to      what you can expect to pay for starter animals purchased in      1986:    </p>    <p>      Calves<br />      Spike (immature) bulls<br />      Cows<br />      Bulls<br />      Royal bulls    </p>    <p>      $400<br />      $500 to $700<br />      $800<br />      $1,000 to $1,100<br />      Up to $1,900    </p>    <p>      On the average - as detailed in the accompanying      article - if you sell your elk for meat, you can      figure on netting around $900 per adult cow . . . and      several times that amount of profit will accrue from bulls      whose antlers are harvested annually for several years      before the animals themselves are sold.    </p>    <p>      And where will you sell your elk meat? According to Wyman,      elk is coming to be considered a delicacy by many Americans      (it always has been for Europeans), and the demand is      growing rapidly. In fact, many restaurants are presently      buying frozen, imported New Zealand red deer (a smaller,      European relative of the wapiti) and advertising it on      their menus as elk, because they can't find a domestic      supplier of the real thing.    </p>    <p>      What about overhead. Elk are more efficient foragers and      eat about a third less than cattle; since they're equipped      to paw and nose down through deep snow to feed, they're      able to provide a higher percentage of their own food in      winter. Wapiti are by nature grazers, preferring grasses      and tender, new-growth plants, but will browse a wide      variety of shrubs in winter.    </p>    <p>      An adult elk should be able to fend entirely for itself on      as little as a couple of acres of good grass during the      warmer months. In winter, however, you'll probably have to      provide some supplemental feed. The Wymans cut and bale      their own alfalfa and grass hay for this purpose . . . and      tell of another elk rancher in Illinois who keeps his      wapiti winter-fat and happy with corn on the cob.    </p>    <p>      Because elk are naturally healthy, they're subject to few      diseases or parasites, and require little if any veterinary      care. The Wymans have experienced no disease in their herd,      though they regularly test for brucellons, tuberculosis,      and internal parasites. And rather than administering      frequent vaccinations or feeding antibiotic supplements,      the Wymans protect their animals by providing them with      plenty of room to roam, and, in winter, by feeding them on      afresh patch of untrampled snow each day.    </p>    <h3>      OTHER CONSIDERATIONS    </h3>    <p>      Although wild elk once roamed most of the United States,      they prefer a cool, dry, high-altitude environment such as      that found in the mountains and forests of the West, and      are not suited to withstand intense heat and high humidity.      While there are prosperous private elk ranches operating in      the Midwest and as far south as the Texas hill country, the      Deep South is pretty much out of the wapiti picture.    </p>    <p>      Finally and foremost, while wild-game ranching, as well as      the selling of elk meat and antlers, is perfectly legal in      most states, it's prohibited in some and regulated in      various ways in others. Consequently, if you're considering      getting into elk, your first move should be to determine      the legality of such a venture in your state.    </p>
