                <p>      <strong>      SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</strong>    </p>            <p>      <em>Does science support lunar folklore?</em>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Greg and Pat Williams</h5>        <p>      Every year, all the almanacs tout the best times to plant,      based on the moon's phase and location in the sky. In      general, the guides say to sow aboveground-bearing crops      during the waxing moon and belowground-bearing crops during      the waning moon. The moon's <em>astrological</em> sign is      supposed to make a difference, as well.    </p>    <p>      Does scientific research back such claims? Hard to say. In      L. Kolisko's 1926-35 German trials, cabbage, lettuce,      beans, peas, tomatoes and cucumbers sown two days before      the full moon had better germination, more vigorous growth      and higher yields than ones planted two days before the new      moon. And after four years of work, Maria and Matthias Thun      concluded that radishes sown when the moon was in the      "earth" signs (Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn) showed the best      root development, those sown in the "water" signs (Pisces,      Scorpio and Cancer) had the most abundant leaf development,      and those sown in "air" and "fire" signs tended to bolt and      seed well.    </p>    <p>      Other researchers have come up empty-handed. A. Becker in      1937-38 found no significant differences in crops planted      on "favorable" days versus ones sown on "non-favorable"      days. And K. Mather and J. Newell sowed various fruits and      roots two days before each moon quarter and also found no      correlation between plant growth and moon phase.    </p>    <p>      Why the contradiction? The problem may come from the fact      that no research (that we know of) has correlated both moon      phase and moon position with plant growth, in accordance      with the claims of the almanacs. In short, the field seems      quite unsettled. Perhaps we can organize an amateur      experimental group to help settle the issue of "lunacy in      horticulture." Feel free to write us and join in.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Research Briefs</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Don't buy precocious tomatoes.</strong> Ohio State      University scientists demonstrated that tomato seedlings      that are already fruiting when transplanted yield      poorly-even if the cute little fruits are      removed.<br />      <br />      <strong>A little diversity goes a long way.</strong>      California entomologists compared plantings of all one      variety of broccoli to mixed plantings of four cultivars.      They found that the combination crops had fewer cabbage      aphids. So merely mixing varieties in a monocultural      planting may help reduce pest problems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sweet apple buds.</strong> West German      experimenters discovered that spraying fall apple buds with      a 10% fructose solution increased the following year's      fruit yields 20%. Why not try it? Fructose is readily      available and (quite) nontoxic.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A very fruitful berry</strong> . The everbearing      Tristar strawberry (Burpee Seed Co., Warminster, PA      18991-0003) produces fruit from spring into mid-October. In      fact, its best berries come in fall. Total yields are two      to three times those of most typical berries. Because of      its small root system, though, Tristar does need some      pampering.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Why do the obvious?</strong> Agricultural Research      Service chemists in Peoria, Illinois, have become so      impressed with organic matter that they've decided to      imitate it. When they learned that microbes in healthy soil      produce complex polysaccharides that help bind the soil and      resist water erosion, they started making their own "soil      polysaccharides" out of cornstarch binders. They'll spray      those on chemically farmed fields to help them mimic      organic ones.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Do seeds have ears?</strong> Bulgarian researchers      report that exposing pepper and cucumber seeds to 20,000 Hz      ultrasound (power unspecified) for three to seven minutes      resulted in better germination, growth and fruit yields. If      you try it yourself, wear earplugs!    </p>    <p>      <strong>So you do want cute little 'maters?</strong> Try      growing cherry tomatoes in indoor hanging baskets. The      varieties Golden Cherry, Florida Hanging and Tiny Tim all      do well in 12-inch hanging baskets (two or three plants per      basket).    </p>        <p>      <strong>The Winner? Fennel!</strong> Hilde Maingay      carefully studied eight flowering herbs-dill,      caraway, fennel, toothpick weed, spearmint, yarrow, rue and      wild carrot-at the New Alchemy Institute to see which      ones attracted the most beneficial insects. She concluded      that "fennel had the greatest insect attendance and,      furthermore, it had large attendance of 'good' insects."      She also noted that fennel is easy to grow (start it      indoors).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Working women's gloves.</strong> Womanswork gloves      are made of brushed pigskin and really fit.
