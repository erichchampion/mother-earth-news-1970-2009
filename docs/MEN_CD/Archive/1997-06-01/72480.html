            		<p>      <strong>GARDEN & YARD</strong>    </p>    		<p>      <strong>Visiting the garden is what separates a gardener      from a green thumb.</strong>		</p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Mort Mather    </h5>            <p>      Gardens don't like to be neglected. Unlike a cat or dog, a      garden can't jump into your lap or bark for attention.      Gardeners have to initiate contact. One way to do that is      to plant the garden on either side of a well-traveled path      like between where you park the car and the house. Another      way is to include a visit to the garden in the daily      routine-get up, go to the bathroom, visit the garden,      shower, eat breakfast...    </p>    <p>      A garden that is forgotten is a garden that has a      diminished chance of doing well. There are, of course,      exceptions, like the tomatoes we planted our first summer      in Maine. Weeds grew up around them supporting them better      than if we had staked them or put a wire basket around      them. The high grass surrounding them protected them from      the wind and no predators, either insect or animal, found      them. We happened upon them just as the fruit was ripening      and considered ourselves truly blessed.    </p>    <p>      That is the only success story I have of a neglected      garden. Don't jump to the conclusion that the opposite of a      neglected garden is one that needs constant care. I am a      lazy gardener. If my garden demanded constant attention, I      would probably try to find something else to make me feel      useful while puttering. I'm pretty sure puttering is my      favorite hobby, not gardening. The garden just happens to      work well for a putterer. T think that if you did a survey      of peo ple who supposedly have a green thumb you would find      that one characteristic was pretty universal-they      visit their garden fairly regularly. Visiting is different      from going out to weed or thin or stake the tomatoes or      pick beans. Visiting is just dropping by to admire it, to      see if the carrots have broken the ground yet, to see if      there are tomatoes on the vine or if any are turning color.      It may be the favorite place to watch the sun rise or set      or to think about what the next day might bring.    </p>    <p>      I am going to take you on some of my visits to my garden      over the years and you will get the idea. You'll learn how      to deal with some of the various animals that also visit      gardens and you'll see how this simple and pleasurable      routine works.    </p>    <p>      When I was working a regular job I would come home during      the growing season and instead of relaxing with a drink or      cup of tea I would head for the garden. It was best if I      changed my pants first as it is really difficult to spend      much time in a garden without dropping a knee now and then.      I think we ought to be called brown knees rather than green      thumbs.    </p>    <p>      I also like to take a hoe with me. Unfortunately for my      pants it was real easy to grab a hoe on my most direct path      to the garden. The hoe was not for any purpose, you      understand, other than to lean on and maybe to scratch at a      few weeds and, since my garden is in sight of the road, to      impress passersby.    </p>    <h3>The Virtues of Fresh Clues</h3>    <p>      One spring day while visiting I noticed that the      high-priced-seed hybrid broccoli that I had planted in a      short row for transplanting later was up-tiny      seedlings with two baby leaves each, each leaf smaller than      the head of a tack. Lovely, I thought, with their dark      blue-green color. On my next visit there were just stems, a      row of quarter-inch-high stems no bigger than toothpicks.      What happened to them? I looked carefully at the soil and      could detect no footprints, no evidence of rabbits or      woodchucks at work. My first visit had been three or four      days earlier. The trail had grown cold. As any detective or      reader of detective mysteries knows, the fresher the      evidence the easier it is to solve the mystery.    </p>    <p>      I decided that flea beetles were the culprit. These small      black beetles do have a decided fondness for this crop. In      subsequent years I have been able to shoo the beetles away      and cover the plants with a gauze net that protects them.      After years of being too lazy to start these seedlings in      flats indoors, I have come to the conclusion that it is      actually easier to coddle them indoors, which really only      requires watering. The first planting of broccoli was one      of several failures due to neglect. Neglect is a pretty      harsh term for just not visiting the garden every day which      I seldom do unless there is a specific reason like keeping      a close eye on newly emerged broccoli seedlings.    </p>    <p>      I have a specific reason to visit the spinach patch      regularly after the seedlings start developing true leaves.      I have had considerable trouble growing spinach. It just      seems to disappear plant by plant in patches leaving me to      harvest about one fourth of the area planted. The plants      look fine and then one day several will be wilted and some      lying on the ground, cut off. Cut worm is the first      thought, but when cutworms are the culprit I can usually      find the grub by scratching around near plants they have      cut off. Not so in the spinach patch. Then I began to be      able to detect slight wilting of upstanding plants. On      further investigation I found that these plants would just      lift out of the ground having little or no root structure.      Some would look as though the root had been cut off about a      quarter of an inch below the soil line leading me to      suspect cut worm again, but I don't know of any cutworm      that works on roots. Then others would come up with a      shriveled root leading me to believe damping off or root      maggots. It took years of casual observation to get to the      point of really wanting to know. Now I have gathered a lot      more evidence but I still don't know what is causing the      problem.    </p>    <p>      However, with a lot of thinking and some reading and some      more thinking I think I have a solution. My guiding premise      is always "healthy plants in a healthy soil don't attract      insects or diseases:' Whatever it is that is cutting back      my harvest so severely, its cause must be a soil imbalance.      But why is there only one crop that has a problem, Sherlock      Holmes?    </p>            <p>      You see my dear Watson, I rely on natural fertilizers in my      soil which are largely insoluble. For these fertilizers to      become available to my plants they must be con verted to a      soluble form, which is what happens when the soil      microorganisms break down organic matter. Over winter the      soil microorganisms become inactive. To make the problem      worse, winter snow and spring rain draining through the      soil carries the soluble materials away. This is called      leaching. Come spring, nutrients are proba bly pretty      scarce, especially nitrogen, unless fresh manure has been      spread. I have been fertilizing my garden with low nitrogen      materials through the summer, expecting that the garden      would always be ready to grow more wonderful vegetables.      Spinach needs a lot of nitrogen.    </p>    <p>      But, Holmes, you never have any problems with peas and they      grow even earlier in the spring. Don't they need nitrogen?    </p>    <p>      Ah yes, but peas are legumes and have the ability to fix      nitrogen from the air. The next time I plant spinach I am      going to use a naturally occurring water soluble high      nitrogen fertilizer like dried blood or manure tea. Blood      is expensive but I will be limiting the use to just the      spinach rows mixing it in just before planting the seeds.    </p>    <p>      You may have gathered that I don't like to use soluble      fertilizers even if they are organic and you are right. Too      much rain will simply wash them away. What a waste not to      mention the damage they may cause in the water. If you are      having trouble grasping the solubility issue, try this      experiment. Put a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of      flour in a coffee filter. Pour water through the filter. If      you catch the water and taste it you will taste salt.      Eventually all the salt will be gone but the flour will      remain in the filter. Now put the filter in the compost      pile. Depending on the microbial activity, the filter and      the flour will be gone in a couple of weeks to a few      months.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, there are times when a detective's      sensibility appeals to me, and without regular visits to      gather clues, I'd still be scratching my head and offering      eulogies to my wilting food.    </p>    <h3>More Nutritional Problems<br />      Nitrogen</h3>        <p>      The symptoms of plants with a nitrogen deficiency are slow,      stunted growth, reduced size, and the leaves becoming pale      green and then yellow, especially the lower portions.    </p>    <p>      While visiting the garden we become more familiar with our      plants. If we know what the corn looks like in a good year,      we are more likely to recognize a problem soon enough to do      something about it. If I noticed that my corn looked      anemic, pale yellowgreen instead of the bright vibrant dark      green I am used to seeing, I would side dress it with      manure or seaweed. I will be surprised if that ever happens      to me since I recognize corn to be a heavy feeder and I      always make sure it has a special dose of manure or seaweed      in the soil before I plant.    </p>    <h3>Phosphorus</h3>    <p>      Phosphorus deficiency causes leaves to turn reddish purple      on blades, veins, and stems, especially on the underside.      When soil tests show that my garden is deficient in      phosphate I like to spread rock phosphate to correct the      problem. This is a ground rock that is not water soluble so      it would not be good in an emergency. It is great for the      long haul, providing phosphate for several years. If I      needed a quick fix, I would probably use bone meal which is      about 21 percent phosphorus.    </p>    <h3>Potassium</h3>    <p>      The edges of leaves of plants with a potassium deficiency      may curl or even turn bronze and dry out and they may get      brown spots. This is most noticeable on the lower parts of      plants. Since I burn several cords of wood every winter I      always have wood ashes around which are approximately seven      percent soluble potassium. You might wonder why I don't      just spread the ashes on the garden when I clean out the      stoves. First, soil tests indicate that my garden doesn't      need any more potassium. Too much of a nutrient can be as      problematic as too little. An overabundance may cause other      nutrients to be bound up so the plants can't use them, for      example. The other reason I don't dump the ashes in the      winter is the solubility of the nutrient. If the plants      need it, I don't want it leaching out of the soil. For      those who don't have wood ashes, greensand is a      commercially available natural product that provides about      five percent potassium.    </p>    <p>      Those are just the three major nutrients. There are      seventeen nutrients altogether that plants need. An expert      can identify many deficiencies just by looking at the      plants. I'm too lazy to try to figure that out. Besides,      what would I do? I'd just kick myself for being too stingy      with the manure or compost or cover crop rotation. I might      try a rescue operation by side dressing compost or watering      with a manure tea or foliar feeding by spraying seaweed      extract. But I don't need to know which nutrient or      secondary or trace nutrient is missing or in low supply. My      approach is usually going to be some complex organic      material to feed the soil and let the microorganisms sort      out who needs what.    </p>    <h3>An Interesting Case</h3>    <p>      By visiting the garden regularly you are less likely to      encounter rude surprises. I got a call one Saturday from a      woman who was practically hysterical. "Something is eating      my whole garden!" she exclaimed. "Please, can you come and      tell me what to do." If she had something that was eating      her whole garden, that would be news. My garden has been      visited by everything from flea beetles to moose and none      of them ate everything. The biggest problem with moose, by      the way, is the size of their feet. Fortunately they have      always been passing through because if they wandered around      a little they would do a lot of damage.    </p>            <p>      Before grabbing my camera to photograph the phenomenon I      thought it best to calm her down and get a little more      information. What were they eating? Everything! Maybe she      planted only the things woodchucks like to eat? It had to      be an animal because insects are very plant-specific.    </p>    <p>      Finally I got this woman to tell me that it was on the      asparagus, it was the size of her finger, yellow and fuzzy.      I had to send her out to look at the culprit again. When      she called the second time she told me that it didn't have      legs. I thought we were getting close but the fuzzy bit      still had me baffled. A slug, fuzzy? She did say fuzzy, not      slimy.    </p>    <p>      I told her she could stick a sharp object like the point of      a knife into them if she wanted to do battle right then and      there. But that they probably wouldn't actually wipe out      any of her crops, even the asparagus. Long-term, she needed      to make the surface of her garden drier as well as the area      around the garden.    </p>    <p>      Slugs don't eat much, not much of the garden that we like      to eat anyway. They actually do more good than harm turning      dead organic matter into plant nutrients But they can be a      problem. They love to live in lettuce and cabbage plants,      down in the lower portions where water collects. At one      time I thought they ate tomatoes because I often found them      inside holes in ripe tomatoes. With more frequent visits to      the garden I learned that the slugs were actual ly getting      into holes that crickets made in the fruit. Not that slugs      won't eat a little of just about everything but their      feeding is not the real problem. The real problem is that      they are not pleasant to come across in the garden, and      less pleasant to come across in the kitchen, and you really      don't want to see them in the dining room. When I was      selling lettuce and cabbage it became absolutely necessary      for me to figure out a way to keep them out of these crops.    </p>    <p>      At that time I was mulching heavily, sometimes the whole      garden, sometimes year around as Ruth Stout advocated in      her books. Slugs love the cool moist environment under a      mulch. I had tried a number of methods all of which worked      to some extent. Slugs are attracted to malt. If you put out      dishes of beer, they will crawl into them and drown. A tip      for those who use this method. Place the beer traps at the      edges of the garden. Otherwise I think they just keep      coming in and when you run out of beer or get tired of      emptying the traps, there are even more slugs in the      garden.    </p>    <p>      Slugs like cool, moist places like under a board. I have      put boards down in the garden paths and sure enough would      get quite a collection of slugs under the boards on a sunny      day. A bit of a bore disposing of them, though.    </p>    <p>      None of these trap methods suited me for an acre market      garden so I decided to make it an environment they wouldn't      like. I have not tried making a barrier of diatomaceous      earth around the garden or around the lettuce and cabbage      but I had read that the sharp edges of this powdery      material would deter slugs. Instead I came up with a method      that suits me best. I just make the area around lettuce and      cabbage as dry as possible. That means no mulch, even on      the adjacent paths. I cultivate the top of the soil, making      it a dry dust most of the time. I also mow closely all      around the garden. This makes a casual barrier for the      slugs since the short grass dries out early in the day. The      lettuce and cabbage patches have to be kept fairly free of      weeds as weeds will collect moisture and shad the ground      keeping it moist during the day. These considerations work      most of the time. I had more slugs in 1996 than I have for      many years. One, it was a wet summer. Two, I did not till      the garden last year and left one section in mulch from the      year before. Still, they were manageable.    </p>    <h3>The Dangers of Over-Watering</h3>    <p>      You have probably noticed that where you have scratched the      surface of cultivated soil, it is drier than the soil left      alone, but do you know why? Do you remember capillary      action from high school physics? The teacher had several      glass tubes with small bores, smaller than a drinking      straw. I know because I just tried one. When the ends of      these tubes were put in water the water defied gravity and      rose in them. It rose highest in the smallest tube. This is      capillary action. Another way to demonstrate it is with two      panes of window glass. Hold them together and dip one end      in water. If water doesn't rise between them, they are too      tight together. Sprinkle a little dirt on them, just enough      to hold them apart a little and try again.    </p>    <p>      When we cultivate the surface of the soil we break the      capillarity, we make the spaces too great for the water to      work against gravity. This dry surface is more than a good      barrier against slugs. It also keeps moisture from coming      to the surface where it will evaporate, thus keeping more      moisture in the soil where the plants can use it. This is      called a dust mulch. Another way to observe this phenomenon      is to notice your footprints in a path you have cultivated      or in the rows you firm when you plant seeds as opposed to      the tilled or raked soil adjacent to the rows.    </p>    <p>      While I'm on the subject of moisture, I should mention the      greatest hazard of visiting the garden: improper watering.      Whenever I see someone standing in a garden or on their      lawn, holding a hose and spraying water, I want to run up      to them and say, "Stop, you are ruining your garden (or      lawn)." If you visit the garden in the middle of a hot      afternoon, you may observe some wilty-looking plants. That      may be their self-defense against the heat of the sun.      Please don't jump to the conclusion that the plants need      water. Check them again in the late evening or morning. If      they look like they need water then, they probably do. If      you have been watering by hand, they probably do. The      problem with watering by hand is that you simply don't have      the patience to stand there for the three hours necessary      to get the job done properly. The spritz you put on the      surface will, at best, evaporate before the roots even know      its there. At worst, the roots will learn to look for water      close to the surface. Now you are in real trouble. Some day      in August drive through a neighborhood where people spend      weekends mowing, grooming and watering their lawns. The      brownest lawns belong to the people who have been on      vacation longest.    </p>    <p>      I will never water a garden more frequently than once a      week and that only in a severe drought. I want the roots to      go as deeply as possible. They are the foundation of a      strong plant. Of course, I've got to put in a plug for      organic matter. The more humus in the soil the more water      it will be able to retain.    </p>    <h3>Duels with Larger Critters</h3>    <p>      Animals are the most important reason for visiting the      garden. Generally the first visit an animal makes is purely      by accident. It is just wandering around looking for food      or just going from here to there or looking for a good      place to make a home. In any case it is going to check out      the potential food it comes across. In my experience      animals generally take a few tastes first. Perhaps they      have learned that something that tastes good may not sit so      well on the stomach later. If it tastes good and there are      no ill effects, they will be back for more. If you let them      have two pleasant experiences, you are likely to have a      serious problem on your hands.    </p>    <p>      Take the woodchuck I matched wits with for two years. If      you don't know what a woodchuck is, it is what groundhogs      are called some places including Maine.    </p>    <p>      Woodchucks and I go way back. When I bought this house 28      years ago they were living in the wood shed under the      porch, used the drainage culvert to cross the road and, in      general, thought they owned the place. I fenced my first      gardens, until one built a home in the winter squash patch.      It wasn't until we got a dog that they decided this was not      prime real estate. It is amazing how canny animals are. Our      most recent dog was nearing the end of her life three years      ago and the woodchucks started moving back. They would      taunt her, it seemed, coming closer and closer knowing that      if they could coax her to get up and chase them they could      beat her back to the hedgerow.    </p>    <p>      Two years ago the dog died and protecting the garden fell      back on me. I had grown lax. I let the critter eat some      lettuce. Then I put out some lettuce in a have-aheart trap.      Are you kidding? Eat wilted lettuce in a trap when fresh is      right there? I had lost the initiative. I then sprayed my      favorite Mexican seasoning on the lettuce and beans,      figuring it would just be a matter of time before he or she      tried those. But it rained and I wasn't visiting the garden      as regularly as I should. The woodchuck was getting fatter      and finding more escape routes. I strung an electric fence      around the garden at woodchuck-nose-height. By now the peas      were being harvested. At one point my son was in the garden      grabbing a snack when he found himself eye to eye with the      woodchuck, who was feasting on something in the garden,      looking for all the world as if it was his or her garden.      When Josh chased it he saw how it got past the fence. It      just lowered its head and ran.    </p>        <p>      If the fence had been there earlier the woodchuck would      have decided the garden was not a nice place. Having      determined that the garden was, in fact, one of the nicest      places for a meal imaginable, he or she was willing to risk      a little shock.    </p>    <p>      So I put up another strand of wire and I seasoned the      plants again. The seasoning, by the way, is about a      tablespoon of liquid detergent and a tablespoon or more,      depending on how angry I am, of Tabasco in a watering can      of water. Animals in Maine, at least, do not like highly      spiced food. This works especially well if this is the      first taste they get from your garden. Almost as well if it      is the second. Past that and you may have more convincing      to do.    </p>    <p>      I feel badly that I misled this animal into believing that      we could be partners in the garden. The next spring when he      started foraging again having spent the winter under my      shop, I gave him or her one more chance. I went around to      all the escape routes I could find-under the porch,      the road culvert, a hole in the hedgerow and the den under      my shop-and plugged them up. I shot at him once but      missed and he ran off to the barn. But still he returned.      By this time I had determined that it was a lone male      planning to establish an attractive place for a mate. He      tempted fate one too many times.    </p>    <p>      I know that it will distress some peo ple to think that I      killed a small furry animal. I would rather not have had      our relationship end that way. Some people tell me that I      should plant enough for the animals and myself. A nice      idea, howev er, I can assure you that all that would do is      increase the population of animals and I would have to      expand the garden every year to accommodate the rising      popula tion. I want animals that eat my vegeta bles to stay      out of my garden and all animals other than humans to stay      out of my house. Anyone who allows mice and t rats to run      unmolested in their homes is welcome to condemn me for      killing the woodchuck. Please remember that I do "take      responsibility for that killing. It was my fault because I      allowed the animal to- become familiar with my      garden.    </p>    <p>      The electric fence around the gar den was wonderful later      in the season when raccoons and porcupines frequently get      into the corn. There is a deer that has found my garden and      comes back every year after the first frost. I strung an      addi tional strand of wire about three feet off the ground      to see if I could persuade the deer that I had moved and      been replaced by a nasty person. One morning I found the      fence down and some deer tracks in the garden but no      damage. The tracks looked like a deer running rather than      wandering. The fence had been put up flimsily so it was no      surprise that it was down. No deer last year.    </p>    <p>      Visiting the garden may be most im portant for animal      control but there are all sorts of things you may come      across that will save time and make for a better garden if      caught at the right moment. If you are staking your      tomatoes, you will probably do a much better job of tying      them to the stake before they flop down with twisted stems.      You'll know when the corn and zucchini are ready to      harvest. You'll catch in sect damage early and be able to      monitor it without panicking. And what gardener can      casually walk through a garden, any garden, without pulling      a weed or two?    </p>    <p>      <em>For those of you on the web, check out Mort's web page.
