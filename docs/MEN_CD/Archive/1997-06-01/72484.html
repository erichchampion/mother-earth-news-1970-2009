                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY SKILLS</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Preserving traditional technology at Tillers      International.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Malara P. Bragg    </h5>                <p>      Picture yourself in an open field under the radiant sun      walking behind a pair of one-ton oxen. The heavy animals      plod rhythmically through the soil and you watch dark      clumps of earth fall to either side of the plow, creating a      furrow for planting. The oxen are wearing a handmade yoke      from the woodworking and blacksmith shop and they respond      to your "gee" and "haw." There is no hum of a tractor and      no smell of its exhaust. You are in southwestern Michigan      working the land the traditional way at Tillers      International, an organization committed to preserving      historical rural skills.    </p>    <p>      Located on 30 acres of country land at the edge of      Kalamazoo, Michigan, Tillers International has offered      training in rural skills for over 15 years. International      rural innovators, American farmers, historical      interpreters, craftspeople, and hobbyists alike travel from      around the United States and abroad to sample classes in      animal power, farm crops, construction skills,      metalworking, woodworking, and international rural      development. Class participants plow fields with draft      horses, build yokes for oxen, forge fireplace tools, and      even travel to Africa to develop and share rural skills      abroad.    </p>    <h3>      Hands-On Experience    </h3>    <p>      "Tillers is a skill-based organization," says director      Richard Roosenberg, with the small classes structured      around hand-son practical experience. In the Sweet Sorghum      Molasses class, for example, people from ages 10 to 70      spend the day cutting and preparing sorghum cane, pressing      it with animal power, and evaporating the juice to      molasses. Participants in the Introduction to Blacksmithing      class go home with their own handmade coal chisel after      covering the basics of hammer skills, heat treating, and      forge welding. Blacksmithing classes are limited to eight      people so everyone uses his or her own anvil and no more      than two people share a forge.    </p>    <p>      The practical experience of Tillers classes draws students,      volunteers, and interns to the organization. "Right from      the start I knew Tillers was a hands-on experience where      you were learning and working to support agricultural      endeavors," recalls former Tillers intern Alex Crockford.      Interested in farming from an ecological standpoint,      Crockford says he came to Tillers from the perspective of      wanting to live on the land appropriately and act as a      steward of the environment.    </p>    <p>      Janet Ott, another former intern, recalls being thrown into      the middle of everything during her first few days at      Tillers, from the workshops to the animal care and the day      to day living. Animals need to be fed, watered, and taken      out to graze and crops need to be tended. Now the spring      plowing, disking, and planting make way for the summer      cultivating. "There's no typical day at Tillers;" Crockford      says. "It starts with chores and ends with chores."    </p>    <h3>      The Tillers Farmstead    </h3>    <p>      The Village Shop, one of the four barns at Tillers, houses      the blacksmithing and woodworking facilities. Built several      years ago as part of a timber framing class, the barn is      unique because it operates off the electrical grid, thanks      to solar cells which power the lights. None of the tools      require electricity. The remaining barns store farm      implements, hay, oxen, and a power tool workshop.    </p>    <p>      A large farmhouse serves as the office and guest house,      providing on-site lodging for interns and visitors.      Finally, an intensive pasture rotation system of oats,      wheat, sorghum, beans, corn, clover, and rice completes the      Tillers farmstead.    </p>    <p>      Maintaining the soil through crop rotation is only one      example of the earthfriendly farming techniques both taught      and practiced at Tillers. The Water and Soil Conservation      class offers visitors hands-on practice using      animal-powered tools for contour ridging and terracing,      creating small catchment dams, and trenching for      irrigation. In the Solar Applications for Small Farms      class, participants practice connecting photovoltaic panels      and wiring for solar electric fencing, small water pumps,      farm lighting, and battery maintenance.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the solar cells in the Village Shop,      Roosenberg says he hopes to hook up a solar pumping device      to water cattle with stream water, as opposed to well      water. The cattle currently are prohibited from walking to      the stream in an effort to protect the soil from erosion.    </p>    <p>      Roosenberg saw a great reaction to the use of animal power      when he worked with the Peace Corp in Benin, West Africa,      in the early 1970s, and wanted to learn more. In 1981, he      started Tillers as a program at the Kalamazoo Nature      Center's historic farmhouse. In 1989, Tillers moved to its      current location at Abbey Farms, gained non-profit status,      and became a program of Rural Futures International.    </p>    <p>      Operating on a tight annual budget of $130,000, Tillers      depends greatly on volunteers and interns. Roosenberg and      Dave Kramer are the only full-time paid employees. Roughly      one-third of the budget comes from donations, while class      fees round out close to another third. The remaining money      is raised by selling oxen no longer needed for field work      or instruction, and handmade oxen yokes and carts not      readily available elsewhere. Publications for sale range      from oxen training handbooks to short papers available for      a few dollars.    </p>    <p>      More than 300 people from 35 states contribute to Tillers      and around 70 people volunteer their time at the      organization. As a result, 400 people took advantage of      Tillers classes last year. Each year approximately 20      people vie for two to four internship slots.    </p>    <h3>      Animal-Powered Agriculture    </h3>    <p>      Crockford took advantage of the Tillers internship program      last year. Although he grew up in suburban Detroit, his      father's tales of life on the farm sparked an interest in      rural skills. When studying biology at Michigan      Technological University, Crockford learned about Tillers      through a demonstration of an oxen-powered water pump. Made      with plywood, old truck inner tubes, and threaded rods, the      tool "pumped water like crazy" and Crockford knew he wanted      to learn more about animal-powered agriculture.    </p>    <p>      Like Crockford, Ott was also drawn to Tillers because of      the unique opportunity to learn about animal-powered      agriculture. After traveling to Morocco with the Peace Corp      in the early 1980s and then earning a degree in animal      science at California State University, Ott, 37, was eager      to use her skills in development. Tillers accommodated Ott      and her husband and two children during her three month      internship in 1992.    </p>    <p>      Working with the oxen was one of Crockford's favorite tasks      at Tillers. "It's amazing to be able to go to a 2,000-pound      steer and tell him to come with you, and he will,      willingly." Crockford found the oxen steady, hard-working,      cheap to maintain, and trainable by anybody, including      children. While at Tillers, he trained oxen, introducing      them to new implements, including carts and sleds, and new      work such as harrowing, disking, mowing and raking hay.    </p>    <p>      Ott also enjoyed working with the oxen at Tillers and keeps      up with her oxdriving skills today at Garfield Farm Museum      in La Fox, Illinois (630-5848485). "Oxen are big and a      little bit clumsy sometimes, but it's such a nice rhythm      walking with them," Ott says. "It gives you time to think      and pay attention to what's going on around you."    </p>        <p>      <strong>Janet Ott and Kizz Josephine train oxen Peter and      John to pull a cart in Uganda, Africa.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Working with the oxen taught Crockford the value of      low-capital rural development first-hand. "If you spread      your labor out over the year and do different activities      that keep your animals in shape, you can get by fairly well      without having the need for a tractor," Crockford found.      "Just because you have a tractor or baler doesn't mean the      work is easier or better."    </p>    <h3>      International Rural Development    </h3>    <p>      And not everybody has a tractor or baler. When Ott applied      rural development skills in Uganda on a three-week Tillers      trip last summer, she discovered the importance of      appropriate technology. "Sure, you can send a tractor over      and they would get the plowing done a whole lot faster, but      is it really appropriate?" she questions. If animals can be      used for a task and people are willing to try it, it's a      lot better than a tractor, Ott says. A tractor may not be      appropriate if fuel or spare parts are not also available.    </p>    <p>      Tillers uses appropriate technology to find what works best      in a situation. "They will take traditional designs and      adapt them, which is different from the history farm where      they're trying to take a traditional thing and maintain      it," Ott notes. With this approach, old and new ideas can      both be used in new ways. If there are no local power      supplies or material sources, for example, you might build      with used tires and scrap-metal. "You can take a piece of      scrap off a car and turn it into a fine woodworking tool,"      Crockford says.    </p>    <p>      The women Ott worked with for three weeks in Uganda were      very receptive to working with the oxen as they quickly      realized how it would reduce their daily burdens, such as      moving produce, water, and firewood. Men traditionally care      for the oxen, so it was something very new to see women      interacting closely with the animals, Ott says. At the      beginning of a training week, the group introduced oxen to      yokes and commands, and by the end of the week they watched      the oxen pull a cart from the swamp with a few cans of      water. Ott was impressed with how quickly the women learned      and developed a rapport with the animals.    </p>    <p>      When Herb Nehring, 78, traveled to Uganda with Tillers      almost two years ago, he helped people put another kind of      traditional skill to use by sharing his blacksmithing      expertise. Along with four others from Tillers, Nehring      joined 40 people representing agricultural departments of      Ugandan districts. Six weeks of training in ox-driving and      pasture-management yielded a new yoke style and the use of      more than one team of oxen per plow for greater efficiency.      Participants took sets of iron back to their districts to      make yokes and put their training to use.    </p>    <h3>      Preserving Historical Skills    </h3>    <p>      In addition to participating in the Uganda trip, Nehring      has been a volunteer blacksmith instructor at Tillers since      1983. Over the years, he has watched Tillers grow from a      program of the Kalamazoo Nature Center with its first set      of oxen, to a larger organization that has worked with      people from at least half a dozen countries. Roosenberg      says he sees more growth in the future of Tillers,      including expanded overseas programs and membership groups      which might lead to developing chapters for easier access      to the organization.    </p>    <p>      Nehring learned blacksmithing skills in 1949, after the      trade started to die out. Today, he strives to keep the      skill alive, calling blacksmithing the most depended-upon      trade in the development of civilization. "At one time      everything made from iron or steel had to be made at the      fire on an anvil with a simple hammer," Nehring says. He      worked as a farrier on and off for 10 years before a      30-year career in the machine shop.    </p>    <p>      "Blacksmithing is a skill where your hand and eye and brain      all have to work together because you're working fast and      can only work while the material's hot.” It takes      dedication and a desire to learn, Nehring adds.    </p>    <p>      Nehring boasts a 98% success rate in teaching the      techniques of forge welding and notes that all class      participants go home with their own usable handmade coal      chisel after two days of Introduction to Blacksmithing.      Most class participants start with little or no experience      or training. As the most popular metal-working course, one      Introduction to Blacksmithing class last year spilled over      into three sessions.    </p>    <p>      In Tillers' future, Nehring says he would like to see      additional funding and exposure so more people can work on      pending projects in Uganda and Tanzania. Tillers helps      people learn, produce, and advance, Nehring says. "It's an      organization that has started out and continues to grow in      the helping of others."    </p>    <p>      To learn more about Tillers, register for a class, or order      a publication, contact them at 5239 S. 24th St., Kalamazoo,      MI, 49002; http://www.wmich.edu/tillers, or      TillersInt@aol.com; (616) 344-3233.    </p>
