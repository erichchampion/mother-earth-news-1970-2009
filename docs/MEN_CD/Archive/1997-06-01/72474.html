            		<p>      <strong>Energy And Environment</strong>		</p>        <p>      We take the sun for granted as it lights, warms and      measures our lifetimes in precise 24-hour segments. This      free, high-quality light and its attendant energies can      enhance our lives by the manner in which it interfaces with      the various structures we inhabit. This light-space      relationship has reached a critical, often unrecognized      importance during the last century as most of us have moved      indoors in the workplace.    </p>        <p>      In the past the sun was taken more seriously with the best      body of "solar law" belonging to the ancient Romans. In      their cities, they carefully controlled building size and      location to enable each space to receive its maximum ration      of light and heat. In America, most farmhouses in the early      colonies were oriented with the long wall facing the sun's      benefits. By the mid 1800s we began to forget the sun's      benefits. The mass production of cast iron wood stoves in      Troy and Albany, NY worked so well as a heater that a      home's position to the sun seemed virtually unimportant.      The common use of the light bulb found us further from the      need to properly employ the sun.    </p>    <p>      Today, over two decades removed from the 1970s' energy      crisis, we are again returning to the solar knowledge our      forefathers embraced. The sun is even available to most      suburban and rural homes which may not have one wall      oriented near south. To determine the "solar window" of the      structure in question for its potential to deliver energy      to the inner spaces, check your own shadow at noon standard      time (1 P.M. if it is daylight savings time) and find solar      south to be opposite your north body shadow. If one wall or      a portion of your structure is within +/-10 degrees of      this, you have good orientation. You will have a nearly      desirable situation, however, if the wall with the most      windows is within 30 degrees of solar south (beware of      westfacing glass, as the summer sun, low in the sky from      June-Sept at 5:30 - 8:30 P.M., can lead to overheating).    </p>    <p>      How do we use this basic knowledge of your own "solar      window" to best enhance the home' s energy efficiency?      There are a number of inexpensive steps that one can apply      to every structure to substantially improve it's      performance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>First:</strong> Remove the largest north-facing      window possible as it always loses energy. Most homes can      afford the loss of one or more non-sunny windows with the      wall that replaces it insulated (R12-R20) much better than      the window (R1-R4).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Second:</strong> Install a larger south-facing      window or enlarge one or more existing units. Remember, the      sun needs to "see" those windows for the majority (5-6      hours) of the day. Choose windows having modern      high-efficiency glass rated at R3R4, and in most cases they      can be non venting Axed units because the typical home      already has enough venting windows. You now have the      opportunity to receive up to 250 Btu's per sq. ft. per hour      at midday ...free. For six hours facing near south during      winter in the northern United States, the average      availability will be 175 Btu's per sq. ft. Each 10 sq. ft.      of glass which will transmit about two-thirds of this      energy will therefore yield 700 free Btu' s to your space      on a sunny day in addition to the daylighting benefit. The      value of this energy can be compared to one thousand watts      of electric heat, or 1 kilowatt, which for one hour yields      3414 Btu's and costs from 10-20 cents, depending on where      you are. This does not count the fact that a window would      probably also reduce lighting electrical usage. A 100-watt      bulb burning for 10 hours also uses a kilowatt.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>EACH 10 SQ. IT...</h3>    <p>      <strong>...of south-facing glass will</strong><br />      <strong>yield 70</strong> <strong>0 Btu's of free      heat</strong><br />      <strong>to your home every day,</strong><br />      <strong>a figure roughly equivalent</strong><br />      <strong>to one thousand watts of</strong><br />      <strong>electric heat.</strong>    </p>		</div>    <p>      <strong>Third:</strong> Increase insulation values. The      concept here is to upgrade the R value (resistance to      energy flow) of various parts of your home's outside      surfaces. The most popular type of insulation is      fiberglass, but without proper installation techniques, its      performance at mid-winter is one-half or less of the      claimed value. Evidence of this is starkly visible in all      northern locales as you observe the huge icicles and roof      ice dams. This often occurs despite fiberglass insulation      with R24 or R30 claims. You must become aware of the proper      installation methods involving an understanding of      ventilation and moisture movement in tight spaces. The      "correct job" is often hard or impossible to achieve in      retrofitting. My general advice is to use one of the foam      sheet insulations (2' x 8' - 4' x 8' etc.) purchased on the      unit pricing principle of cost per installed R value.      Generally foil faced urethanes (polyisocyanurate) or      Styrofoam are best.    </p>    <p>      One would first retrofit the north roof, paying particular      attention to making sure the roof covering (whether it is      shingle, tile, slate, or any other surface) is secure and      contains no openings to the insulation housing beneath.      Next in priority would be the northern wall(s), and final      the south roof and walls. As you proceed, replace all      windows with modern units having R values of at least 3 to      4, which usually have their perimeter cracks foamed with a      non-expanding spray foam. Remember, the most essential part      of insulating is the attendant sealing of all gaps, wires      and other penetrations with a high quality caulk.    </p>    <p>      One must at the same time insulate the portions of the      walls or foundation below the siding typically left undone      in the past. Why would you want your house to be barefoot      in winter? One should dig up the foundation as far down as      possible and install the foam insulation (at least R8-19)      with an outside-quality waterproof membrane before      backfilling. This may offer a highly recommended      opportunity to install better drainage to daylight than the      typical home received at its origination. You can complete      this foundation insulation job by covering the outside      surface from 6" - 8" below grade up to the bottom of the      siding with 3/8" pressure-treated plywood or other      weatherproof skirting material.    </p>    <p>      Finally, one must upgrade the basement or crawl-space and      make a serious effort to shut off ground water and, more      importantly, the invisible movement of ground moisture as      water vapor into the home. Even the best insulated modern      homes, which are reasonably insulated as required by code      on 5 sides of their "box," fail to close themselves off      from ground moisture. The vast majority of homeowners spend      a goodly portion (5-10%) of their heating and cooling      budget trying dry out the ground under their house Mid      never succeed. You could test yowl own home during winter      conditions by placing a 10-15 square foot piece of a vapor      barrier over your concrete basement floor or crawlspace      dirt and you will observe with in a day water droplets on      its earth sick. Many methods are available to mitigate this      undesirable moisture movement. It your basement is usually      dry and crack free, you can apply one of the quality liquid      surface treatments designed waterproof the concrete. A      crawl-space can be fixed by installing a large piece of      Flatic vapor barrier everywhere, and carefully sealing all      penetrations with the edge held in place by weights such as      bricks or pressure-treated wood scraps. Older, uneven      rock-lai d or degraded basements will need further, more      extensive efforts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fourth:</strong> The previous reasoning with      windows its solar collectors also applies toy new or      existing doors with glass placed (oil sunny exposures. That      old wooden door was a 40-60 lb. object that you slammed a      few thousand times each year and still had expectations of      it's sealing tightly. The old saying that such doors were      so poorly scaled that "you could throw a cat through them"      is not as ridiculous as you might think. Modern doors with      urethane core insulation, steel or fiberglass facings and      the latest insulated glazing are a huge improvement over      the older wooden door. The major improvement is in their      sealing, on roughly 20 linear feet of perimeter crack with      a deformable or magnetic gasket These doors are one of your      best retrofitting buys as they reduce air leakage to a      small percentage of the average door that they replace.    </p>    <p>      Since the average structure has a large portion of its      energy losses from air movement through many unsealed      cracks and openings, we need to make a concerted effort to      tackle them. One needs to consider both in-filtration and      ex-filtration of air, both driven by the obvious causes of      the wind with attendant door and window crack leakage.      Those air leaks are in fact driven in larger part by      unrealized factors such as door operation, vent fan      operation and barometric pressure changes. Additionally,      perhaps the most common leakage is one caused by air      expanding as we heat it. During an average winter, the      interior air will need to be heated an average of 50°F.      As the air heats, it expands, and requires that much more      prevention from escaping. Sealing of the myriad gaps beyond      that of window and door openings and their frame cracks      involves a careful examination of your home's complete      exterior. A good place to start is the clothes-dryer vent.      Typically these vents are a perfect example of how not to      insulate an opening, with its skimpy aluminum flapper.      Purchasing a substantial plastic replacement with a      vertical outlet capped by an upside-down can would be a      tremendous start. The can is simply lifted off its pipe      during operation and closed by gravity. Other fan vents      should also be checked and improved where possible. The      last vents to check would be those that service the attic      space above your insulation, as they may well be too small      for the job. Check the latest information on venting above      insulation, and upgrade yours accordingly.    </p>    <p>      Purchase some high-quality caulk (latex, silicone or one      component urethane as appropriate) and relentlessly pursue      a crack-sealing mission. It is one of the most effective      expenditures you'll ever make. Don't overdo it; more isn't      necessarily better, just be sure the caulk makes it well      into the confines of the small crack or space to be sealed.      Heating the tube in warm water to 100-110°F often helps      its flow rate. Use an old sock with a hole in its toe to      cover the tube to keep it warm. Gaps wider than 3/16" -      1/4" should be sealed with a one-component spray foam.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fifth:</strong> Tackle the reduction of heating and      cooling costs that are beyond the obvious tune-art, of your      mechanical equipment and major exterior gaps. A start is to      follow the common regimen used earlier in the century of      closing drapes and curtains to exclude heat or cold. More      to the point is a reduction of solar gain in summer which      can be at its peak after 2 pm through southwesterly or      western windows. Fortunately, the awning industry has      returned in most parts of our land and the outside      application of shading combined with the use of a whole      house fan getting its air from the non-sunny side, can go a      long way toward naturally cooling your space. Daily      reductions of 8-10°F are easily possible with just this      method. A large maple tree planted in the appropriate      western space can be nearly as effective. It is best to      manage energy gains or losses on the surface you are trying      to control. While outside devices work best for excluding      summer's heat, inside insulation work best to keep heat in.    </p>    <p>      Consider insulating the inside of some of your non-sunny      windows. It may be possible to forgo a few windows (in a      closet or seldom-used room) for the winter. An inexpensive      all-season insulation can be a piece of 1/2-1" rigid foam,      tightly fitted inside the window, and left from Nov.-March.      This same foam can be backed with a thin piece of old      paneling or plywood and covered with cloth to be made more      attractive; or if you feel the sacrifice of the window      would be too drastic, then install the foam on Sunday night      and remove it Saturday morning, or use it on a nightly      basis. If you are keen to combine recycling with budget      retrofitting, you could use "bubble-pack" or "foam packing      peanuts," to loosely fill plastic bags. Use the bags as      fillers between the storm window or door and the main unit.      Remember not to violate proper fire exit routes in the      process, and keep in mind that many of these materials are      flammable. In order to install inside window insulation,      you'll need to do better than the typical drape, curtain or      shade of the past. The modern approach must involve a      device that is sealed at all edges, as one of the most      important part of the insulation package is the air trapped      between the device and the window.    </p>    <p>      Good luck to you on your management of all errant Btu's.    </p>
