                <p><strong>      Back Country</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>It was along North Carolina's bass- and trout-filled      lakes that I learned the basics.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline"><em>      By Joel Bourne.</em>    </h5>        <p>      Thousands of years ago some benevolent god hurled a large      meteor toward eastern North Carolina, and when it struck it      scoured a long, shallow depression in the soil. The      depression soon filled with water and the water soon filled      with fish-bream and crappie and large-mouth      bass-which today inhabit a lake 18 miles long, six      miles wide, and an average of two feet deep. Or so one      story goes. If true, that deity surely was the god of      fly-fishing, and his gift was Lake Mattamuskeet.    </p>    <p>      In the past few decades the lake has become a shimmering      mecca for long-rodders along the eastern seaboard.      Recently, some friends and I decided to make our      pilgrimage.    </p>    <h3>      GOLDEN GIFT    </h3>    <p>      My first fly rod was given to me by a friend of my      father's. The weathered South Bend rod was the color of      amber beer, and to me it was the scepter of Midas.    </p>        <p>      The mixing of religion and fly-fishing began in      1676-when Izaac Walton published his legendary volume      on the subject, <em>The Compleat</em> Angler - and      has continued through Robert Redford's glowing film      adaption of A <em>River Runs Through It,</em> one of the      sport's finest epistles by Norman MacLean. But somewhere      along the line -perhaps because of the great weight      of fly-fishing literature- the sport has become      burdened with elitist baggage. It has come to conjure      images of bespectacled men sporting wicker creels and      split-bamboo rods pouring over microscopic insect      imitations that could tool a nearsighted entomologist. I      don't know if the blame lies in the stereotype, the      space-age materials of the tackle, or the latest line of      fishing fashion from Orvis, but it seems a heavy toll for a      fishing rod that is second cousin to a cane pole. The point      is, you don't have to look like Robert Redford at 20, have      a Ph.D. (or a Gold Card), or have read <em>A River Runs      Through It</em> to get a big kick out of fly-fishing. All      it takes is a little practice, patience, and, like all      forms of fishing, a little prayer.    </p>    <p>      Fly-fishing for bass further erodes the sport's elitist      sensibilities-pearls before swine some might      say-which is one of the reasons I love it. Trout      fishermen spend hours trying to match their flies to tiny      insects hovering above a stream, hoping to coax a finicky      trout to bite. Bass are never finicky. When they are      hungry, they are just as liable to quaff a chartreuse      spinner bait with hula skirts and spinning blades as      something that looks more familiar. Trout are streamlined      and bullet shaped. Bass sport huge beer guts. Trout are      fast and graceful and fight like Sugar Ray Leonard. Bass      are the George Foremans of the freshwater fishes.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the root of fly-fishing elitism lies in the vast      array of gear that goes with it. Rods alone vary in length      from six and a half feet for tiny trout streams to 10 feet      or longer for big rivers, lakes, and saltwater fishing.      They are made of fiberglass, graphite, or a composite of      both, as well as the traditional bamboo. Graphite and      composite rods, ounce for ounce, give more power and      responsiveness for their weight, but they also come with a      hefty price tag. Bamboo rods, if you can find one, are      priced like works of art. I've always had a fondness for      affordable, flexible fiberglass, probably for the same      reason that one never forgets one's first true love.    </p>    <p>      My first fly rod was given to me by a friend of my      father's. He was a towering man named Dinksie (his      brother's name was Boo Boo) who shaved his head with a      straight razor, kept a slot machine in his garage, and had      a reputation as something of a prankster. It was a      weathered fiberglass South Bend rod, the color of amber      beer, but to a 10-year-old, it could have been the scepter      of Midas.    </p>    <p>      I remember Dinksie taking it down from its nook and handing      it to me, barely concealing a mischievous grin. He      proceeded to give me a few pointers about fly casting:      "Remember boy, take it back to 10 o'clock, then forward to      two, back to 10, forward to two. Ten ...and two... 10...and      two. Think you can remember that?"    </p>    <p>      I said yes, because it seemed the quickest way of getting      my hands on the rod, but meant no because I didn't have a      clue as to what he was taking about. Until that moment I      had no idea that you could use a fly rod for more than      swinging crickets. Dinksie knew better.    </p>    <p>      There followed a long and tortuous period of learning to      cast, which nearly every fly-fisherman describes as long      and tortuous but which only seems so at the time. When you      are 10, anything that takes longer than opening a gum      wrapper seems long and tortuous.    </p>    <p>      Although you can catch bass on any fly rod, those designed      for the species are around nine feet in length. The rod I      took to Mattamuskeet was a nine-foot fiberglass rod I built      in college. (To say I "built" the rod is a bit misleading.      I purchased the fiberglass blank, eyes, reel seat, and      handle from a mail-order outfit and assembled it on my      kitchen table, much to my roommate's chagrin. I bought the      best blank I could afford at the time, wrapped the eyes on      with a natty burgundy thread and ended up spending about      $70 on the whole rig. It has performed admirably ever      since.)    </p>        <h3>      RULE OF THUMB    </h3>    <p>      Fly lines come in different weights, varying from about      three weight to 12 weight.<br />      In general, the lighter and shorter the rod, the lighter      the line.    </p>    <p>      Unlike other types of fishing in which the reel plays a      vital part, in fly-fishing for bass and panfish it's damn      near superfluous. The reel simply stores the line to keep      it from getting underfoot when wading or from piling up on      the bottom of the boat. Most have a simple drag feature      that slows the speed of the line as it goes out, but the      same effect can be achieved by applying a finger or palm to      the back of the spool. A good reel should have enough      capacity to hold the line and balance the rod at      mid-handle.    </p>    <p>      If you talk to enough fly-fishermen, sooner or later one      will tell you that you cast the line, not the lure, which      is true. The line is the blood of the beast and it is here      that things start to get complicated. The line (with its      various sections) consists of four parts: the backing, the      fly line, the leader, and the tippet. The backing is      usually 20-pound-test braided Dacron, wound around the base      of the spool. Theoretically, it's there in case you hook      Moby Dick in the farm pond and it takes 40 yards of backing      to slow him down. In reality it provides a cushion for the      vastly more expensive fly line, keeping it from forming      tight coils oil the spool and extending its life in the      bargain. Then again, you never know when you might need it.    </p>    <p>      Fly lines come in different weights, shapes, and      buoyancies. Line weights vary from about three weight to 12      weight; in general, the lighter and shorter the rod, the      lighter the line. A light-action, seven-foot trout rod, for      example, might take three, four, or five weight line, while      a nine-foot bass rod is better suited to seven or eight      weight. Heavier lures require heavier line as well.      Fortunately, most rods have the appropriate line weight      printed on the back to eliminate confusion.    </p>    <p>      But this is just the beginning. Most lines are either level      throughout for general use, tapered at both ends (double      tapered) for short, delicate casts; weight forward for      longer casts with heavier flies; or shooting taper, with a      heavier forward section that decreases to a level running      line for very long casts. They also come in floating (F),      in which the entire line floats, sinking tip (F/S) in which      the first 10 feet of the line sinks, or sinking (S) in      which the entire line sinks.    </p>    <p>      Sinking lines and tips are most often used in fast rivers      or large lakes when the fish are deep and you need to get      the fly down to them quickly. For bass, weight forward,      floating line works well. Here's where you will sink some      cash. High-quality fly line costs from $20 to $50, but with      proper care and cleaning it can last for years.    </p>    <p>      While the fly line does most of the heavy lifting, the      leader and tippet do the fine work, rolling the fly over to      land deftly on the water. The oldfashioned leaders were      made by knotting together increasingly smaller monofilament      lines. Today, preformed, tapered monofilament leaders are      standard. Leaders are measured at the smallest diameter of      the tippet-the section at the very end-and      range in diameter from 0X (13-pound test) to 7X (2.4-pound      test). Bass leaders are relatively short (four to six feet      long) and are usually 0X to 3X in diameter. You can also      buy a short, braided leader and tie tippet material onto      it.    </p>    <p>      Another thing that sets the bass fly-fisherman apart from      the rest of the breed is the lures used. Trout lures are      called "flies." Bass lures are aptly called "bugs." These      lures can be made of deer hair or cork and come in a      variety of colors and sizes. White, red, yellow, black, and      green are common plug colors. They also come in various      patterns that look something like favorite bass foods such      as frogs, mice, bees, minnows, and spiders.    </p>    <p>      The beauty of a bass bug is purely in the eyes of the      beholder, and everyone has their favorite. I like small      yellow, white, and bumble-bee pattern poppers. The week      before our trip to Mattamuskeet, my friends and I scoured      the local tackle stores and catalogs, compiling quite an      assortment. We even found some rather exotic deer-hair bugs      with long feathery tails that were supposed to look like      floating worms-a classic Mattamuskeet bass lure for      bait-casters. I also took a huge saltwater popper,      about two inches long, thinking I might try it just for      fun. One never knows. I have seen a 10-inch bass attack a      stick-bait more than half its size with impunity.    </p>    <p>      Lake Mattamuskeet is more than just a fly-fisherman's      paradise. The shallow lake is a magnet for thousands of      migratory ducks, geese, and swans on the Atlantic Flyway      each year. It also drew the attention of speculators in the      early 1900s who made several attempts to drain it and plant      crops in the lake bed. One group built an elaborate pumping      station and a series of large drainage canals and dikes      based on those in Holland. They actually succeeded in      planting part of the lake for a couple of years, but the      cost of continuously operating the massive pumps to keep      back the water eventually bankrupted them. The lake was      acquired by the federal government in 1934, and a waterfowl      sanctuary was established there.    </p>    <p>      Today the lake and 10,000 acres of surrounding forests,      swamps, and fields are part of the Mattamuskeet National      Wildlife Refuge. The lake is open to fishing from March 1      to November 1. The old pumping station, with its      distinctive observation tower, was designated a National      Historic Site in 1980 and stands as a monument to man's      earlier ill-fated endeavor.    </p>    <p>      I sensed some of the early industrialists' frustration as I      drove across the causeway, spanning the middle of the lake      in the waning afternoon light. For the last 30 minutes of      the drive I had been teased by glimpses of the lake through      the trees along the roadside. But my heart sank as the      broad expanse came into view. A stiff, 15-knot breeze was      chopping the lake surface into foot-high waves. Though      great for keeping mosquitoes at bay, wind on Mattamuskeet      churns the water into a cloudy soup and makes fly casting      all the more difficult.    </p>    <p>      I met Phil Livesay and Wayne Sasser at a nearby restaurant      and we headed for a small campground on the lake's edge. We      pitched the tents within a stone's throw of the water and      discussed our strategy. We had heard of a relatively secret      spot in one of the impoundments - accessible only by      canoe or small john boat - which had produced a few      nice fish, and decided to give it a try. The plan settled,      we drank a toast to the lake and turned in, serenaded by      wind whistling through the cypress trees and waves lapping      on the shore. Just before I fell asleep I thought I heard      the distinctive plunk of a bass rising for its evening      meal. It could have been a dream, or an omen for the      morrow.    </p>    <p>      The wake-up call came at 5:30 A.M. when the first trucks      began rolling down the path toward the boat launch at the      other end of the campground. It seems the weekend we picked      for our pilgrimage coincided with a local bass fishing      tournament, and the crowd was hitting the lake at daylight.      Our initial chagrin quickly evaporated, however, when Phil      pointed toward the lake and said, "Check it out". It's      surface was frozen in a mirrorlike calm. Not a breath of      wind broke the stillness. We downed cups of hot coffee,      loaded the rods and canoes, and headed for the canal that      led to our secret spot.    </p>    <p>      One of the great advantages of fishing on a wildlife refuge      is the abundance of wildlife one sees, especially if you      are gliding along almost silently in a canoe. Although      waterfowl populations have declined steadily in the last      three decades, during winter the lake still provides refuge      for some 12,000 Canada geese, 75,000 puddle ducks, 35,000      tundra swans, 5,000 snow geese, and about 35,000 diving      ducks. A small population of Canada geese stay year-round      and we could hear them calling on the lake. In addition to      waterfowl, 240 species of birds and other wildlife make the      lake their home year-round. As we paddled, we were escorted      by Eastern kingbirds and red-winged blackbirds, while a      northern flicker rattled out its Morse code on a hollow      cypress nearby.    </p>    <p>      When we arrived at the designated spot, we hauled the      canoes over an embankment and into a secondary canal. The      canal traced the edge of a flooded impoundment dotted with      small islands and stands of cattails and reeds. Lily pads      spread across the surface creating pockets of green on the      clear, teacolored water. Phil and Wayne paddled down the      canal, making short casts from the canoe. I headed for the      edge of the drop-off where the water depth shrank from six      feet to two, and stepped overboard, feeling the cool      Mattamuskeet mud ooze between my toes - another      fringe benefit of wading.    </p>    <p>      I assembled the rod, tied on a small yellow popper, and      began casting to the far edge of the canal. It had been      several months since I'd last picked up the rod and it took      a while to remember the feel, but Dinksie's advice from      long ago still echoed in my head. The trap many fall into      when they first start fly casting is trying to cast the      weight of the lure (which is almost nothing) instead of a      loop of line. Others try to use the power of their arm      instead of the inherent power built into the rod. As a      result, they end up flailing around as if they were trying      to swat a fly instead of cast one, or cracking the line      like a whip, which is a great way to snap off lures.    </p>    <p>      Again, reams have been written about the proper technique,      but the basics are pretty simple. I worked out a length of      line with a couple of false casts and went over them one by      one. Start with the line and lure straight ahead with the      rod tip low, a foot or so from the water. Lift the line off      the water until the rod is cocked at 10 o'clock, just past      one's ear, and stop. Wait one count - maybe two      depending on how much line is out - to let the fly      catch up to the line and begin its turn behind you. Then      when you feel the weight of the line on the rod, move it      forward for the power stroke, stopping at two o'clock. If      done right, the line sails forward in a graceful loop      landing the fly, then the leader, then the line. If you      take the rod too far back or whip it too far forward, the      line piles up in a rat's nest at your feet. It's a natural      motion, once it is understood, but it takes patience,      practice, and a feel for when to apply the power.    </p>    <p>      I put it on a little too heavy this time and the fly lands      in the weeds. Getting hung is part of the game, sort of      like jumping offside in football. It's embarrassing, but      you learn to live with it. A good friend of mine who was      notorious for snagging trees used to say, "If you're not      getting hung, you're not putting it where the fish are." I      retrieve my bug and begin working it down the edge of the      grassy bank, trying to hit open pockets among the lily pads      that perch like emerald saucers on the dark water.    </p>    <p>      A lot of folks are so enamored of their fly casting that      they forget all about the retrieve. They tug the line a      time or two, twitch the rod tip to give their bug a little      action, and then they're off to the next hole down the      line. But to me, this is the defining moment, the raison      d'etre. I guess it's a holdover from my boyhood days spent      fishing with crickets on the farm pond. I'd study them      intently as they struggled in the surface film, sending      telepathic ripples across the water until a fat bream or      bass would rise beneath them and in a flick of a fin turn      them into lunch. It was such glorious anticipation. The      trick is to make the popper do a suggestive dance. A      legendary southern outdoorsman once compared the retrieval      of a floating lure to the seduction of a beautiful woman.    </p>    <p>      After about 10 casts, I send the yellow popper toward a      perfect opening in the lily pads on the other side of the      canal and it lands like a raindrop, sending expanding      circles across the water. I count to 10, col lecting the      slack line in my free hand, and then give the line a slight      tug. The bug takes a quick dive and makes a pleasant      gurgle. Ten more seconds...another gurgle... 10 more      seconds...a third. Just as I am about to lift the line and      move along, a small depth charge explodes beneath the      popper and it disappears, leaving the tippet racing through      the water in its wake.    </p>    <p>      One of the advantages of a fly rod is that its length and      limberness communicate the entire story at once. I feel the      weight of the fish, its heavy beating tail strokes and the      tension of the fragile leader as it scrapes past coarse      stems of the lily pads. It fights like a good-size bass,      not wasting energy on acrobatics but powering into the      depths toward a denser patch of pads. If it reaches them,      it'll wrap the leader around a maze of stalks and be off in      an instant. This is the game played over and over by fish      and fishermen: when to apply pressure to the line, how much      to apply, and where the breaking point of the leader lies.    </p>    <p>      With a casting or spinning rod, the secret is in the drag      of the reel, but with a fly rod it's in the fisherman's      fingers, the pressure on the line as it races through one's      hand, and the weight of the palm on the reel. I keep the      line taut and the rod bends in shivering arcs, turning the      fish away from the refuge of the pads and into the deep      water of the canal. It comes up only once and swirls at the      surface, revealing its dark back and translucent,      moss-green sides. It makes a few more powerful runs, but      they are not as long nor as energetic. Within minutes I am      looking into its large liquid eyes only an arm's length      away.    </p>    <p>      It is at this point that the perils of wading become      apparent. The fisherman and fish are literally in the same      element and what looks like spindly legs to one may look      like fine structure to the other. Once when I was first      learning the finer points of the sport I stared too long at      a large bass swimming with my fly in its mouth a few feet      away, only to recoil in shock as he dashed for my leg,      imbedding the hook in the meaty part of my thigh. Such      things leave lasting impressions. This fish had no such      antics in mind. I eased him closer, grabbed him by his      lower lip, and removed the hook. He was a respectable      two-pound bass, a common size in the lake. After admiring      the soft green colors and patterns of his skin, I released      him back to his home in the pads.    </p>    <p>      We fished the impoundment and one nearby for the rest of      the day, catching and releasing fish as we went. After      covering the canal banks we moved into an area of flooded      timber and began catching plump, rosy-breasted bream with      regularity. By the end of the day, the count was nine bass,      30 or so bream, and a crappie or two thrown in for good      measure. This was in addition to countless bird and animal      species we'd seen, including ospreys, Canada geese,      kingfishers, and tree swallows. A young raccoon even      sauntered past the bow of my canoe as we were taking it out      of the impoundment, completely indifferent to our presence.    </p>    <p>      As we paddled down the canal in the fading light we      surprised two yearling white-tail deer grazing on the      embankment. The female ignored us, but the male, still      without his first set of horns, gave a brief, wobbly dance      of defiance, then resumed his browsing. Just one more gift      to the pilgrims of Mattamuskeet.    </p>        <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Lake Mattamuskeet is North Carolina's      largest natural lake, averaging only two feet in depth      but</em> <em>18</em> <em>miles in length.
