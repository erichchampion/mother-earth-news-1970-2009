                <p>      If you're a shutterbug on a budget, here's a camera support      you can make in just munites.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Ron Spomer    </h5>    <p><strong>      Photos By The Author</strong>    </p>        <p>      The lowly beanbag hasn't a leg to stand on, but that      doesn't keep it from being a superb photographic "tripod."      It's sturdier, lighter, simpler to use, and more versatile      than most three-legged support systems, and if you make it      yourself, it costs next to nothing.    </p>    <p>      Professional photographers have long known that one of the      reasons their photos are consistently superior to the      snapshots taken by amateurs is the pros' use of solid      camera-mounting systems; too many novice shutterbugs are      willing to risk the clarity of their images to shaky hands      and wobbly knees.    </p>        <p>      But by simply filling a home-sewn cloth sack with dried      grain, even the lowest-budgeted photographer can "support"      his or her camera habit in style. A beanbag can be poked,      pounded, and fluffed to form a comfortable rest for just      about any camera-and-lens combination you can come up with,      and will anchor that equipment to odd shapes and inclines      seemingly steep enough to defy gravity.    </p>    <p>      I was introduced to the beanbag tripod several years ago by      a professional photographer friend. He called it a bean      pod, and he'd been using it for years to capture roadside      wildlife on film.    </p>    <p>      Over the past few years I've fabricated and used several      varieties of bean pods (which can be filled with dried      corn, beans or peas, rice, small pebbles, or even those      dumb plastic foam "peanuts" used as packing insulation),      and I've found them useful for far more than mobile      wildlife photography:    </p>    <p>      By placing a beanbag on the ground, you can get an      ant's-eye view of wildflowers, mice, mushrooms, insects,      and other terrain-hugging forms of life. This down-to-earth      perspective adds an interesting new dimension to any slide      show or photo album-and dollars to your income if      you're a pro.    </p>        <p>      For shooting landscapes-when it's necessary to      sacrifice shutter speed in favor of increased depth of      field-haul out a beanbag, plop it firmly down on top      of a fence post, stump, or rock, seat your camera securely      in the bag, and squeeze of dead-sharp shots with shutter      speeds as slow as two or three seconds. Because this      homemade photo accessory supports so much of the bottom      surface of a camera and lens (rather than balancing all the      weight at a single point as a tripod screw does), it's      often actually sturdier than a traditional three-legged      stand. Wind, a slight tremor of the shutter release finger,      and even the movement of the camera's own mirror can blur a      slow shot taken atop a tripod. That seldom happens on a      beanbag.    </p>    <p>      The trick is to snuggle your camera securely into the lump      of beans (or whatever you're using in their place), then      press down firmly so that the instrument is comfortably      seated in its rest. Once you master the system (which takes      the average photographer all of two minutes), you'll      discover that it's possible to make successful slow-shutter      shots without employing a cable release.    </p>        <p>      Big telephoto lenses-300mm and longer-are      particularly susceptible to motion blur, since they magnify      movement as much as they do an image. Even so, I've      photographed owls at dusk using a <em>600mm</em> lens and a      shutter speed of 1/8 of a second . . . and the results were      sharp enough for a wildlife magazine to print. Of course,      that magnum-caliber lens was held in the steadying embrace      of sacked corn.    </p>    <p>      Occasionally you'll need to anchor your camera someplace      where there are no horizontal (or even semihorizontal)      supports. With a beanbag, you can create a support by      holding the pouch against a wall, tree, or whatever surface      is handy, then resting your camera on the bag. That leaves      one hand free to manipulate the instrument. Of course, this      particular variation of the beanbag system can't be called      steady as a rock, but if you take a deep breath, exhale      half of it, relax, and squeeze the shutter, you should be      able to make top-quality exposures at shutter speeds down      to 1/15 of a second or so.    </p>    <p>      Beanbags, in addition to substituting for tripods, can also      be used in conjunction with them. Beanbag-wise      professionals sometimes lay bean sacks on top of cameras      that are mounted on sturdy tripods. That extra mass of      weight atop the camera absorbs the minuscule flicker of      shutter-induced movement, allowing for absolute steadiness      when professional-quality results area must.    </p>    <h3>      BEANBAG CRAFTSMANSHIP    </h3>                    <p>      If you've got the coordination necessary to use a camera,      you can certainly handle making a beanbag tripod.    </p>    <p>      The fabric you use for the sack should be nonabrasive,      tightly woven, and tough enough to withstand hard knocks      and rugged use without ripping. Denim is perfect; a section      of old jeans leg is ideal . . . and is half-finished before      you even touch it. Just cut a piece of leg to the length      you want your bean pod to be, sew one end shut, fill the      resulting pouch loosely with the "beans" of your choice,      and sew the top shut. (For added strength, the seams should      be double- or even triple-stitched.)    </p>    <p>      Naturally, the dimensions-and to some extent,      shape-of your beanbag will be determined by the photo      equipment you'll use with it: A tiny rangefinder camera      will rest comfortably on a 3" X 6" pant's pocket filled to      a thickness of less than an inch; a massive 500mm lens      attached to a motorized 35mm SLR (single lens reflex)      camera body might require a large bag as much as 6 inches      thick. If you'll be resting your makeshift tripod over the      windowsill of your car or truck, as my friend the wildlife      photographer does, give it some floppy "legs" to hang down      either side of the door. And when maximum stability is your      goal, think big.    </p>    <h3>      THE ULTIMATE IN PORTABILITY    </h3>    <p>      For added versatility, you can make an "inflatable" beanbag      by sewing a zipper into one end of the sack. (Plastic      zippers are less durable than metal ones, but they're also      less likely to mar expensive and delicate photo equipment.)      To assure that you don't lose your beans at an inopportune      moment, make several extra passes over the ends and corners      of the zipper with strong thread.    </p>    <p>      This closeable opening will let you pack a virtually      weightless and bulkless wad of cloth deep into the woods or      to the top of a mountain-where you can fatten the      slack sack with wild nuts, stream gravel, sand, dirt, or      whatever natural materials are at hand-and have an      instant tripod for that "I've been there and I can prove it      with pictures" photo session.    </p>    <h3>      LET 'EM EAT BEANBAGS!    </h3>    <p>      If you carry your zippered sack into the woods prestuffed      with nuts, seeds, popcorn, gorp, jelly beans, or anything      else edible, you can lunch on your beanbag to help fuel the      return hike.    </p>    <p>      No matter which of its many variations you decide to try,      I'm sure you'll find the incredible (and even edible)      beanbag to be the handiest most versatile tripod money      can't buy.    </p>    <p>      For a lightweight, bulkless, "inflatable' beanbag tripod      that can be carried empty into the field and filled with      whatever natural materials are at hand, sew a zipper into      one end of the sack.    </p>
