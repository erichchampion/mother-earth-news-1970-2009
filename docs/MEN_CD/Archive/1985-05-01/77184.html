                 <p><strong>Opinions & Expertise</strong></p>		     <h3>      Soil and Trouble    </h3>        <p>      An environmental news service known as Earthscan has just      released preliminary findings of an ongoing study that      ought to be required reading for every public official. The      report is titled "Environment and Conflict: Links Between      Ecological Decay, Environmental Bankruptcy, and Political      and Military Instability" ($5.00 from Earthscan, 1717      Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, DC 20036).    </p>    <p>      The authors of the report, Lloyd Timberlake and Jon Tinker,      look at that most important of questions: Why do people go      to war? The list of reasons is long and complicated, and      can include such imponderables as religion and simple      jealousy. But what about resources? It seems unquestionable      that environmental decay could easily lead to organized      violence: When soil erosion leads to a drop in agricultural      production, for example, and people can no longer raise      enough to feed themselves, it stands to reason that they      will eventually turn to war or revolution to get their due.      The point may <em>seem</em> obvious, but up to now there      has been little comprehensive research on the subject.    </p>    <p>      Timberlake and Tinker don't claim to have proved a direct      cause-and-effect relationship between environmental decay      and any particular conflict, but their research has      revealed a startling pattern: From Central America to the      Horn of Africa, from Poland to Afghanistan, where      environmental degradation is worst, shooting wars have      broken out.    </p>    <h3>      Reagan Shuffles His Staff    </h3>        <p>      President Reagan's second term has already witnessed major      shifts in staff assignments, including important changes in      most agencies with environmental responsibilities. How this      will affect the policies the administration will pursue is      not clear, but early portents are not encouraging.    </p>    <p>      The first to go - scant days after the election      - was William Ruckelshaus, whom the president had      called back to the Environmental Protection Agency to clean      up the mess left behind by Anne Gorsuch Burford.      Ruckelshaus was replaced by his deputy, Lee Thomas, whose      first major act was to reverse a sensible EPA position in      opposition to Westway, a huge highway project boondoggle on      the west shore of Manhattan. A harbinger?    </p>    <p>      Perhaps. Soon after Ruckelshaus left the administration, he      was followed by Interior Secretary William Clark, who had      been put into his job to settle the dust kicked up by his      predecessor, James Watt. Clark was replaced by Donald      Hodel, until recently secretary of energy. Hodel earned a      modicum of notoriety for dreaming up - and then      selling to many small utilities - a      five-nuclear-power-plant system in Washington State (the      infamous WPPSS). The system has been a fiscal disaster      almost from the beginning and recently resulted in the      biggest bond default in American history. Hodel's first act      as interior secretary was to offer for lease several      million acres on the outer continental shelf off northern      California, something that Congress had prevented both Watt      and Clark from doing. (It's likely that Hodel will be      slapped down as well.)    </p>    <h3>      Don't Dump on Me    </h3>        <p>      The long and tortuous search for a permanent burial site      for the radioactive waste generated by the commercial      nuclear power industry narrowed somewhat when the Energy      Department recommended recently that three sites be studied      for their geologic suitability. Howls of protest from all      three regions greeted the announcement.    </p>    <p>      Favored sites are at Yucca Mountain in Nevada (Nevada      Governor Richard Bryan promised to veto the site if it is      the final selection); the Hanford reservation in Washington      (Washington Governor Booth Gardner said, "I think there is      a significant chance that the waste might escape"); and a      spot in Deaf Smith County, Texas (Texas Governor Mark White      said, "Before the people of Deaf Smith County will glow in      the dark, sparks will fly"). The DOE hopes to make a final      selection in about five years.    </p>    <h3>      Heavy Reading    </h3>    <p>      If you want some reading material that will keep you both      fascinated and horrified, keep an eye out for Farley      Mowat's latest, <em>Sea of Slaughter</em> , published by      the Atlantic Monthly Press in April.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sea of Slaughter</em> is Mowat's account of the      systematic extermination of dozens of species of birds,      mammals, and fish on the northeastern coast of North      America. Penguins, bears, whales - just about      anything that moved was slaughtered. Indeed, the butchering      of baby seals off Newfoundland that so shocks and appalls      us today is remarkable mainly because there are seals left      to kill.    </p>    <p>      Mowat's chilling book is not exactly enjoyable, but it is      important.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The activities of the worldwide      organization called Friends of the Earth - along with      a broad range of other news concerning ecological      developmentsare described each month in its publication      titled</em> Not Man Apart <em>.
