            			<p>      <em>Telling people where to get a good meal can turn into a      profitable part-time home business.</em>    </p>		        <h5 id="byline">      by Eric Wahler    </h5>    <p>      I'm not exactly a member of the Hearst dynasty, but I can      honestly say that I earned $900 last year from my own      publishing business. Better yet, I invested almost no money      of my own and only 60 hours of spare time in the whole      enterprise. I publish a menu guide, and I've yet to see a      more satisfying and risk-free money-maker.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT IS IT?    </h3>        <p>      A menu guide is what you probably wished you had in your      hands the last time you checked into a motel on unfamiliar      turf. It's a booklet that answers the traveler's perennial      question, Where do I go to get a good meal? A menu guide is      also one of those rarest of creatures: a piece of      advertising that's not only fun to look at, but immediately      useful to the possessor.    </p>    <p>      In it, readers find the actual menus offered by local      restaurants, as well as their business hours, addresses,      phone numbers, and positions on a locator map. This sort of      advertising doesn't just tease - it delivers!    </p>    <p>      Having said all that, I must remind you that I'm talking      specifically about my product, the <em>Bozeman Menu      Guide</em> . Similar booklets are sold in some large      cities, but my little creations are paid for and      distributed in a way that reflects conditions in Bozeman,      Montana, which has a population of 25,000. So bear in mind,      please, that I'll be talking about a small-city adaptation      of a big-city idea.    </p>    <h3>      FROM MEGALOPOLIS TO MONTANA    </h3>    <p>      Three years ago, when I began planning my first guide, I      asked a friend, "What tourist would <em>buy</em> a      Bozeman-size booklet when he or she could skim through it      at a bookstall, pick out a restaurant, and put the pamphlet      back on the rack?"    </p>    <p>      "Nobody would pay for it," my friend answered, "but lots of      people might look at it. So get the restaurants to finance      the whole deal, and then distribute free copies to motels.      That way, thousands of hungry folks will see them over the      course of a year. And I don't see any reason why the      restaurants wouldn't pay in advance for that sort of      advertising." By golly, that solved my first (and worst)      problem!    </p>    <p>      Of course, I still had to persuade the local motel people      to cooperate. I wasn't too worried, though. After all, the      guides would be free to them and would provide a service to      their customers. And the motel owners <em>did</em>      cooperate - with the exception of those whose places      had in-house restaurants. Those business people wanted      nothing to do with a publication that might draw clients      away from <em>their</em> dining rooms, and I couldn't blame      them for their attitude. However, this disappointment was      more than made up for by the eagerness of the people whose      establishments didn't offer meals. In the end, I managed to      line up nine motels with a total of 400 rooms.    </p>    <p>      Knowing a home for my booklets was assured gave me the      gumption to go on to the next step. First, I counted every      restaurant in Bozeman. Then, from that total I subtracted      the big national chains, since I wanted my guide to focus      on local businesses . . . and maybe even give them a chance      to compete with the monstrous advertising budgets of the      "big guys."    </p>    <h3>      AN "ESTIMABLE" JOB    </h3>    <p>      I was able to turn up almost 50 local eateries, as well as      20 chains. That's a heap of grub-peddlers for a place this      size, but we're a tourist and university town, and I      <em>did</em> count every last sandwich shop in my effort to      get some figures together for a trip to the printers. I      wanted to know how many potential pages they should      estimate for. I'd already decided to sell only full-page      ads, so the most wildly successful book would run 50 pages,      provided I ignored the chains. Realistically, I decided to      have my costs (which are figured by the sheet) estimated      for 40, 24, and 12 pages.    </p>    <p>      I couldn't be absolutely sure of how many copies I wanted,      of course, until I knew the costs. However, since printers'      per-page prices drop as the number of copies ordered      increases, I had to give them a ballpark figure. I would      publish only one edition a year and knew I'd need      replacements to keep each room stocked, so I pulled the      number 1,500 out of the air - a good guess, as it      turned out. Then, after selecting some nice, mid-priced      paper for the cover and pages, I left a string of printers      busily tallying figures and went on to my next step: the      selection of a graphic artist to design the cover.    </p>    <p>      It may seem strange to order a cover before a book even      goes into print, but I wanted something concrete to help my      potential customers visualize the finished guide. Bozeman      is an artsy town, so I had no trouble locating a cover      designer and was looking at an attractive rendering of my      general concept the very next day. The cost of that piece      of artwork ($150) has been the only expense I've ever had      to risk myself, and I now know some people who would have      done the job for less money . . . or for barter. Still, I      <em>had</em> to go with a professional that first year (and      since I'm still using the artwork at no additional expense,      I'm not complaining).    </p>    <p>      On the same day that I picked up the cover, I also gathered      my printing estimates. The printer I chose offered a good      reputation along with great prices, and I was able to use      those figures to come up with a price per page to charge my      advertisers.    </p>    <p>      The formula was simple: I just multiplied the printer's      per-sheet estimate by two. <em>That</em> figure was large      enough to absorb hidden costs and to give me a decent      profit. The hidden costs I anticipated were such things as      reduction charges (to bring a big menu down to my 8-1/2" X      11" booklet size) and typesetting (to add a restaurant's      name, phone number, and address to menus missing these bits      of information). Anyway, I now had a nice round figure to      charge the restaurants (it was $100 the first year, and      I've since raised it to $125), a beautiful cover to show,      and <em>almost</em> enough preparation to start selling.    </p>    <h3>      GET READY (REALLY READY!),<br />      GET SET . . .    </h3>    <p>      Maybe I'm too fussy, but I still felt the need for one more      security blanket before facing my first restaurant manager:      a typed sheet listing the names of my distribution motels,      my name and phone number, a projected readership figure,      and a little blurb about how wonderfully targeted to hungry      travelers the menu guide would be. I obtained the figure I      wanted most, the readership estimate, by converting the      year-round occupancy rate for Bozeman motels (a percentage      gathered from the chamber of commerce) into a decimal (63%      = .63) and then multiplying that decimal by the total      number of rooms I had lined up (.63 X 400). Then I      multiplied that sum by 1.5, a rough estimate of the      <em>average</em> number of people in an occupied room. When      the resulting figure was multiplied by the days in a year,      the result yielded was an impressive 137,970 readers! As I      say, I may be fussy, but it sure didn't <em>hurt</em> to      bring the image of 137,970 hungry tourists into that first      eatery.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SELL!</strong>    </p>        <p>      Have you ever felt your stomach doing gymnastics while your      palms were practically squirting sweat? That's the way I      felt on my first selling day. I was dressed to the neck      (oh, that tight collar!) in an outfit I used to call my      marrying-and-burying suit. Now I know that a clean pair of      cords and a nice shirt would have been spiffy enough for      this part of the country, but there are <em>plenty</em> of      things I know now that I didn't know then!    </p>    <p>      I used to think, for instance, that the telephone was a      salesperson's best friend. Not anymore! Sure, you can make      appointments with a phone, but nothing beats the personal      touch when it comes to pitching sales. Nowadays I almost      never use the telephone. Instead, I stick my head in the      door and ask, "Do you have a couple of minutes?" If the      answer is no, I make an appointment. It sure beats being      put on hold . . . or being told you'll be called back (and      wasting time waiting for the call) . . . or, worst of all,      being asked to explain your business plan over the phone.    </p>    <p>      OK, so much for the technique of selling. What about      results? Let me just say it's a good thing I doubled the      printer's per-page estimate to figure my prices, or I      wouldn't have done too well. As it was, I worked about 80      hours that first year, sold 12 pages, and made $400 -      not bad at all, to my way of thinking, especially since I      held another, full-time, job during the whole process.    </p>    <h3>      BITS AND PIECES    </h3>    <p>      However, I've jumped ahead of myself a little with all that      talk about profits. In reality, when the selling has been      done, you're still a few long yards from the finish line.      For one thing, you need to sort out all the bits of      information (such as phone numbers) that you picked up with      the menus and then get your organized self down to the      printer's. For another, there's the "locator map" to      design. My wife, Brenda, did that, but be forewarned that      it's not a job for a rank amateur. You may need to pay the      printer to do it.    </p>        <p>      The map went on the back cover of the menu guides. I also      had it printed on separate sheets of inexpensive paper (I      ordered 500 copies) to be given away at motel desks. This      would allow travelers to refer to the map while driving, so      they wouldn't have to take along the whole menu guide (and      forget to bring it back!).    </p>    <p>      And while you're designing the map and getting organized      for the printer, you'll probably be wondering about the      places that haven't paid you yet. This <em>is</em> a      pay-in-advance business, but many customers like to see      something happening before they part with their cash.      Oblige them, by all means, by presenting the proof book (a      mock-up of how the final product will look) to them for      inspection. <em>You'll</em> certainly want to look at it      before printing starts, so why not use it to reassure the      restaurant people, too? In fact, it's not a bad idea to      show the proof book to all of your clients, whether they've      paid or not, to avoid misunderstandings later.    </p>    <p>      Suppose you've collected all the money, the proof looks      good, and the presses are ready to roll - is there      anything else to be done? No, not really. Just wait (from      one to three weeks, probably). Then when the booklets roll      off the presses, get them first to the restaurants (one      copy each) and then to the motels as fast as you can.      (Divide them up in proportion to the number of rooms in      each place.) And <em>then</em> take a couple of copies home      and celebrate. After all, you're a publisher!    </p>
