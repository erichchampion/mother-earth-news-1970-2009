                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Willow It Grow?    </h2>        <p>      Spring has sprung, gardening is no doubt on the minds of      most of MOTHER's readers, and more than a few of us      probably already have dirt under our fingernails. So it      seems only appropriate to focus this issue's Country Lore      on tips for developing green thumbs.    </p>    <p>      For starters, Newton Falls, Ohio, reader Darlene Kistler      writes that "the enzymes found in willow cuttings allow      them to grow almost anywhere there's damp soil. To capture      those miraculous growth enzymes to use as an organic      rooting compound for your own cuttings, here's what you do:      After the sap is up, scrape the bark from several young      willow shoots. Put the scrapings to soak in just enough      water to cover them completely. Dip each of your cuttings      in the willow `juice' before planting, then water them with      any of the liquid that's left over. They'll love the TLC,      and you'll love the results."    </p>    <h3>      For the Birds    </h3>    <p>      "We grow sunflowers for winter birdseed," writes Mena,      Arkansas, reader Sherry Balkenhol. "After we've planted our      sweet corn and it starts coming up, we plant sunflowers in      any empty spots in the corn rows (the corn helps protect      the sunflowers from the wind). At harvesttime, we cut the      sunflower heads off with about a foot of stem attached and      store them in burlap bags-which we hang from the      rafters of our barn to keep the seed safe from rodents. In      winter, we just wire the heads to the fence line by their      stems and let the birds do the rest."    </p>    <h3>      "Match-ilizer" Sparks Growth    </h3>        <p>      Another tip for avoiding, or at least minimizing,      transplant shock was sent in by Arlene Raymond, of Detroit,      Michigan. Arlene writes, "I was recently given 12 tomato      plants that a friend had purchased a month previously and      never gotten around to planting. They looked terrible,      providing me with the perfect excuse to try a trick my      grandparents had used for years. To make an experiment of      it, I placed six of the sickly plants in holes with an inch      of compost in the bottom; the other six were planted the      same way, but with the addition of an unburnt paper match      placed under each plant. The plants with the `match-ilizer'      got over the shock of transplanting quicker, looked      healthier, and grew larger than their matchless      companions."    </p>    <h3>      Wheelchair Gardening    </h3>        <p>      Handycaps Unlimited, of Washington, D.C., writes to remind      us all that "this is the International Decade for the      Disabled-so why not provide a Country Lore feature      for the handicapped gardener?" Why not, indeed-and      here's the suggestion HU provided. "Stack three discarded      au tomobile tires atop each other and fill the resulting      container with good soil. This is exactly the height of a      wheelchair seat, allowing a handicapped gardener to tend      his or her crops from the chair. A series of these      three-tired planters placed in a straight line down the      garden makes it possible for the disabled gardener to use      the space alongside the row of tires as I a pathway."    </p>    <h3>      Gardening Tools -Special Delivery    </h3>        <p>      Craig Scharf, of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, writes, "My      father's garden is quite a distance from his house. So when      he gets out to the plot and realizes that he's forgotten      something he needs, he's faced with a long and frustrating      hike back. Dad solved the problem by putting up an old      mailbox (the box type with the red flag) at the edge of the      garden. Now all his small gardening tools are right where      they should be, and he can leave them there all summer with      no fear that they'll rust."    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
