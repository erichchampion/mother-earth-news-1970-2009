                    <h5 id="byline">      By Deborah Dunn    </h5>    <p><strong>      STAFF PHOTO</strong>    </p>    <p>      It's common, this time of year, to hold wedding receptions      in an outdoor beauty spot. But whether your party takes      place outside or in, the following dishes, perhaps adorned      with fresh wildflowers, will add to the festivity of a      special and joyful day.    </p>    <h3>      SPICE CAKE    </h3>        <p>      6 cups whole wheat flour (or 3 cups whole wheat and 3 cups      unbleached flour)<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons salt<br />      3 tablespoons baking powder<br />      1 tablespoon cinnamon<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons nutmeg<br />      1 teaspoon cloves<br />      1 teaspoon ginger<br />      1 teaspoon cardamom<br />      9 eggs<br />      2 cups oil or soft butter<br />      2-1/2 cups honey<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      3 cups water or fruit juice (apple, apricot, or      orange)<br />      2 cups chopped walnuts<br />      1-1/2 cups plumped raisins (pour boiling water over the      raisins and let them sit for 20 minutes)    </p>    <p>      Sift together (twice) the flour, salt, baking powder, and      spices. Cream the eggs, oil, honey, and vanilla. Add the      dry mixture, alternating with the water or juice, to the      wet mixture, and beat well. Add the chopped nuts and      drained raisins, and bake in a greased and floured pan at      350°F for 35 to 40 minutes or until the middle of the      cake is springy. Cool the cakes on racks to prevent them      from drying out. If you don't frost them as soon as they're      cool, brush with melted butter to seal in the moisture.      Makes three cakes.    </p>    <h3>      ORANGE-DATE CAKE    </h3>    <p>      6 cups sifted whole wheat flour (or 3 cups whole wheat and      3 cups unbleached flour)<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons salt<br />      3 tablespoons baking powder<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1-1/2 cups soft butter<br />      2-1/2 cups honey<br />      6 beaten eggs<br />      6 tablespoons grated orange rind<br />      2 cups milk or buttermilk<br />      3 cups chopped dates<br />      1-1/2 cups chopped walnuts<br />      3/4 cup flour (to dust dates and nuts)    </p>        <p>      Sift together (twice) the flour, salt, baking powder, and      cinnamon. Cream the butter, honey, and eggs together, and      add the orange rind to that mixture. Slowly mix in the      sifted, dry ingredients, alternating them with the milk.      When the mixture is smooth, stir in the floured dates and      nuts. Pour the batter into three greased and floured pans,      and bake for 35 to 40 minutes at 350°F. Cool the layers      on racks. Makes three cakes.    </p>    <p>      Either of these cakes can be topped with the following      frosting.    </p>    <h3>      CREAM CHEESE FROSTING    </h3>    <p>      5 packages cream cheese<br />      2 sticks real butter<br />      4 teaspoons vanilla<br />      2 teaspoons almond extract<br />      1 cup honey    </p>    <p>      Cream these ingredients together and spread them on the      cooled cakes. Then decorate with fresh flowers and fresh      fruit, toasted almonds, walnuts, coconut, raisins,      cinnamon, date sugar, fresh mint leaves, dates, or cut-out      cookies.    </p>    <h3>      SWEDISH RYE BREAD    </h3>    <p>      4 tablespoons dry yeast<br />      2 cups warm water<br />      4 tablespoons butter<br />      1-1/3 cups hot water<br />      2/3 cup molasses<br />      2-1/2 tablespoons salt<br />      2 tablespoons caraway seed<br />      2 tablespoons fennel seed<br />      3 tablespoons freshly grated orange peel<br />      6 cups rye flour<br />      6 cups whole wheat pastry flour    </p>    <p>      Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. In a large bowl, melt      the butter in the hot water and add all of the ingredients      except the flour. In a separate bowl, sift together the rye      and whole wheat pastry-flour.    </p>    <p>      Add most of the flour to the liquid, stirring well to make      a stiff dough. Put some of the ... flour on a lame board,      and knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic.
