                <p>      <em>Earth sheltering and passive/active solar design team      up for energy effeciency in Oklahoma.</em>    </p>                <p>      Joe Hylton is one of a growing number of architects who are      making their services more affordable by offering      standardized plans. Hylton, a graduate of the renowned      University of Oklahoma School of Architecture, has been      designing energy-efficient buildings since the mid-1970's      and now offers a choice of 145 standardized plans for      subterranean and active or passive solar homes.    </p>    <p>      One of the more attractive and efficient of Joe's designs      is Solarc 98, a passive solar, subterranean house with      allowance for an active solar setup. The 2,132-square-foot      home (with another 441 square feet in the garage) has three      bedrooms and a large central family area . . . as well as a      generous utility room basked against the subterranean      8-inch concrete northwest wall. Passive gain is through      more than 100 square feet of glass on the south wall and a      clerestory in the light well centered over the main living      area. The light well has operable windows so that a      ventilation path can be established between this high point      and operable panes low in the south wall. Active collectors      can also be fitted to the larger clerestory shown to the      west of the light well. All exposed walls are framed with 2      X 6's and have fiberglass batt insulation; both the bermed      walls and the ceiling, which is covered with 18 inches of      earth, are thermally protected by 2 inches of rigid foam.    </p>            <p>      The home shown in the photos was built by Dorothy and Ray      Plummer and incorporates several custom changes from the      standard Solarc 98 plan. First, and most obvious, the      Plummets added an 18-foot-long greenhouse to the south wall      of the living room. With over 200 square feet of glazing,      this addition can contribute better than 200,000 Btu per      day to space heating. Thermal mass for storage - from      the 8-inch poured walls and 4-inch slab - amounts to      over 100 tons. What's more, the central heating and cooling      system is a water-source heat pump that circulates      propylene glycol in a 900-foot-long closed loop of 2-inch      polyethylene pipe buried five to six feet beneath the earth      on the south side of the house.    </p>    <p>      Solarc 98 was designed in 1980 and first occupied in May of      1983. During the 12-month period from August 1983 through      July 1984, the Plummets' electrical usage was 17,554 kwh,      including the power used to pump water from a well. Their      average monthly power bill amounts to 1,463 kwh . . . or      $81.34. These figures were produced during a year in which      there were 12% more heating degree-days than usual, and the      heat pump was out of action for the entire month of      December, forcing the family to rely on inefficient      electric heat!    </p>    <p>      Hylton offers his services in three different ways. First,      standard plan sets are $190 for one copy, $230 for four. Or      a customer can engage the architect to modify a set of      standard plans for 50 cents per square foot. This includes      10 sets of drawings and specifications. The third option is      a complete custom design at 90 cents per square foot for      buildings up to 3,000 square feet. You can get a copy of      Joe Hylton's <em>Earth Sheltered and Solar Homes: A Book of      Plans</em> by sending $14.95, plus $2.50 postage and      handling, to Joe Hylton & Associates, 313 E. Boyd St.,      Norman, OK 73069.    </p>
