                <p>      <strong><em>Don't pass up this nutritious, delicious,      easy-to-grow vegetable. Learn the secrets of . .      .</em></strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by Patricia H. Morris    </h5>        <p>      When I first started raising bedding plants for sale, I was      able to gain some expertise from reading, and picked up a      few tips from my friendly competitors, as well. But the      forcing of sweet potato "slips," a specialty practiced by      only a few growers, was a secret that no one seemed to wish      to share. Eventually, however, a man who was about to      retire agreed to teach me his methods.    </p>    <p>      This grower started his slips in a hotbed. He dug out an      area about 1' deep, laid down 2" of straw (sometimes, he      said, he used corncobs or even small broken twigs), and      covered the coarse layer with 4" of fresh horse manure      topped by about 3" of loose and leveled sandy soil.    </p>    <p>      Sound tubers from the previous year's crop were laid on      this bed, topped with another 3" to 4" of very sandy soil,      and watered. The entire seedbed was then covered with panes      of glass raised upon a frame, and burlap bags were placed      over the panes to retain the warmth generated below. A few      days later, the manure had begun to decompose, and the sand      felt warm to the touch.    </p>    <p>      After about two weeks, my instructor removed the burlap      insulation to allow the shoots to soak up some sunlight.      (The first green beauties were just peeking through the      sand.) He also opened the glass a bit to provide      ventilation on sunny days and-when the plants were      about 5" tall-removed the cover.    </p>    <p>      The "opening of the tater bed" was an event that had been      eagerly awaited by our area's impatient gardeners, and they      flocked to the event like chickens to a pail of cracked      corn. The grower dug gently into the sand and snapped the      plants from the tubers with a slightly twisting, tugging      motion . . . bundled them as ordered . . . and passed the      young sprouts to waiting hands.    </p>    <p>      By nightfall, the bed looked like a disaster area, but the      grower watered it thoroughly with lukewarm water, and the      surface once again appeared smooth and level. He assured me      that more shoots would emerge to supply the gardeners who      hadn't been able to come on "opening day."    </p>    <h3>      ON MY OWN    </h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, I couldn't make immediate use of the      knowledge I'd gained, since I had no ready source of fresh      manure or sproutable homegrown stock. Finally, with the      help of our local farmer's cooperative, I managed to order      some certified seed potatoes and then went on to devise my      own starting bed while waiting for them to arrive.    </p>    <p>      I constructed 8" sides to surround a section of greenhouse      bench and covered the bottom of this bed with 3" of sand. A      plastic skirt enclosed the area underneath the bench, with      all four sides going completely to the ground. Then, to      warm my slips-to-be, I put an electric heater, well      protected from dripping water, in the enclosed space under      the bench.    </p>    <p>      When the roots arrived, I placed them on the sand so that      they were almost, but not quite, touching one another. Then      I filled the bed nearly to the top with more sand and      soaked it with water before inserting a thermometer about      halfway down into the sand. (A soil thermometer might have      been more appropriate, but I had none, and an ordinary      household type seemed to serve just as well.) Finally, I      put a plastic sheet over the bed to hold the warmth during      the initial heating.    </p>    <p>      Once the heater was turned on, I allowed it to run until      the sand registered about 95°F. Then I let the soil      temperature gradually subside and held it at 80°.    </p>    <p>      Occasional watering was required during the forcing of the      sprouts, since the heat tended to dry out the sand. I      always used warm water (about 100°F) so as not to cool      down the sprouting roots.    </p>    <p>      Once the shoots were visible, I let the sand temperature      drop to 70°F, because the impetus provided by the      initial extreme warmth would keep the sprouts coming, and      temperatures above 75° would promote elongation of      existing plants. In fact, my first shoots did get very long      before it was time to plant them out, so I transferred them      to 4"-diameter pots and let them form husky root systems.      These plants were pinched after three sets of leaves had      developed, to hold them to a manageable size. I left      subsequent slips right in the sand until selling time, but      they did become very crowded.    </p>    <p>      In later years I solved the crowding problem by preparing a      second bed near the starter bed, filling it with regular      potting soil, opening miniature trenches 3" apart, and      heeling in the first flush of plants, spacing them 1/2" to      1" apart. Sweet potato slips can get leggy very quickly,      and replanting slows down the growth, allows the plants to      form roots, and keeps them in good shape for two to three      weeks, which is sometimes necessary if the weather turns      unexpectedly cold when the plants are ready to sell.    </p>    <h3>      FOR THE HOME GARDEN    </h3>    <p>      Nowadays, gardens tend to be smaller than they were when I      first got into business, and sweet potatoes aren't grown as      extensively. Many gardeners, however, still like to include      a short row in their backyards. The plants are pretty, and      almost care-free once started, and the roots provide      delicious eating.    </p>    <p>      Sweet potato slips can, of course, be ordered by mail or      purchased from markets that receive supplies from the      South. But these usually have been several days in transit      before you get them, and they're frequently only available      in large packages of 50 to 100 plants.    </p>    <p>      A small number of slips can be obtained by starting tubers      in the same way you'd start a sweet potato vine for use as      a houseplant. To do this, you'll probably need to find      sweet potatoes somewhere other than at the supermarket,      since those are often treated with a chemical to keep them      from sprouting. (Try local farmers' markets, or you can      order untreated potatoes for slips from Gurney Seed &      Nursery, Yankton, SD 57079; J.W. Jung Seed Company, 339 S.      High St., Randolf, WI 53957; Burpee Seed Company, 300 Park      Ave., Warminster, PA 18974; or H.G. Hastings and Company,      Box 4274, Atlanta, GA 30302.) Choose a healthy tuber and      stick three toothpicks around the sides so they extend out      at right angles. Lower the root into a glass or jar of      water, letting the toothpicks rest on the rim and making      sure the bottom of the root is covered with water. Keep the      jar in a warm, sunny window and change the water      occasionally. I've also read that you can cut sweet      potatoes in half lengthwise, lay them, cut side down, in an      aluminum pan filled with moist peat moss, cover them with      more peat, and then enclose the whole assembly in a plastic      bag. This sounds like a good alternative, but I've had poor      results with it myself: The halves tended to rot.    </p>    <p>      No matter which method you choose, though, the real key to      slipping this tropical vine is heat. The soil (or sand)      temperature must at first be at least 80°F if you're to      be successful, and the shoots will need lots of bright      light as soon as they break the surface.    </p>    <p>      Although it's <em>possible</em> to get as many as 50 slips      from <em>one</em> large root, don't depend on three      potatoes producing a total of many more than 25.    </p>    <p>      Finally, be sure to choose a variety particularly suited to      your growing season and climate. Centennial, which is well      adapted to cool summers, grows well in our Appalachian      garden. It has deep orange flesh and skin and yields      extra-large roots. For warmer climates, try the delicious      Bush Porto Rico. It grows in limited space, has      copper-colored skin and reddish orange flesh, and is      excellent for baking. The early-maturing, high-yield Jewell      is another warm-weather potato. Its bright copper skin and      deep orange flesh have long made it a favorite for      holidays. Your local extension agent or nursery can help      you decide on the best variety for your locale.    </p>    <h3>      CULTIVATION TIPS    </h3>        <p>      In our part of West Virginia, sweet potatoes are commonly      grown atop 6" to 12" ridges and are spaced about 3' apart.      This hilling provides good drainage and contributes to the      early warming of the soil. Feel free to choose the sandiest      spot in the garden, too, since the ground doesn't need to      be rich to grow a bumper crop of sweet potatoes.    </p>    <p>      If you use fertilizer, you'll need a lownitrogen mix      (5-10-10), and you should count on using about 1-1/4 pounds      per 25' row. Bonemeal is also good for sweet potatoes. Use      1 cup per 25' row, and side-dress with the same amount when      the plants begin to spread.    </p>    <p>      It's best, however, not to rush to get this particular crop      in the ground; the soil temperature should be at      <em>least</em> 60°F. In West Virginia, slips aren't      usually planted until around Memorial Day, and when the      spring has been cold, they're often not put out until      mid-June.    </p>    <p>      Plants are set deeply in the ridges, sometimes with only a      crown of leaves showing. Long stringy ones are best laid      horizontal ly. Cover the stems with soil, and the tops will      turn upward in a day or so.    </p>    <p>      Newly set plants should be watered for a few days while      they recover from planting a shock. After that, they'll      need little attention.    </p>    <p>      Weed control is necessary for a short while, but once the      plants begin to vine, their leafy canopy will shade out      most emerging weedlings. (Though sweet potatoes are quite      drought-resistant, watering during dry spells <em>will</em>      increase yields.)    </p>        <p>      Our growing season is short compared to some, and we've      discovered that many long season crops respond well to      mulching with plastic. Sweet potatoes in particular seem to      produce better when this material is used for early-season      soil warming.    </p>    <p>      I lay the plastic over the prepared ridges, anchor the      edges with stones or soil, and insert the plants through      slits cut in the sheet. The earlier and more intense ground      heat that results from the black material's sun-soaking      properties tends to give the plants a much quicker start;      the mulch also eliminates the need for cultivation or      weeding.    </p>    <p>      If your garden space is limited, try growing a few sweet      potatoes in a container. It should be at least 12" deep and      15" wide (a bushel basket is fine). Use a light, porous,      sandy mix and put a trellis in the middle to support the      vine. Since these plants have no self-supporting tendrils,      you'll need to weave the growth through the openings.      Tubers grown in such confined space are rounder and shorter      than those produced in open ground, but they have a very      fine, meaty taste.    </p>    <p>      Sweet potatoes destined for long-term storage are best      harvested late in the season, because the tubers continue      to enlarge throughout the life of the vine. (You can,      however, run your fingers through the soil around the base      of the plant and steal a few for an early taste without      damaging the rest.)    </p>    <p>      Dig the entire crop immediately after the first frost, or      even earlier if the weather is unseasonably cool, because a      ground temperature of below 50°F can promote decay in      the roots even if frost doesn't occur. However, make sure      you're gentle when handling the sweet potatoes; dig      cautiously-using a garden fork-and transport      them with care. The slightest cut or bruise will greatly      shorten a tuber's storage life.    </p>    <p>      Dry the potatoes in the sun for about half an hour, but no      longer, then lay a single layer in a box, cover the tubers      with perforated plastic or newspaper, and cure the crop at      room temperature for two weeks. You'll want to store the      potatoes in a spot where the temperature will remain      between 55° and 60°F, since anything cooler will      promote rot and warmer temperatures will encourage the      roots to sprout. Your hoarded harvest should provide you      with some fine winter dishes-but don't forget to save a few      medium-size potatoes to use when starting <em>next</em>      year's plants!    </p>
