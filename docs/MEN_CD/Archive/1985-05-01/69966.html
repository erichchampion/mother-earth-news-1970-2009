                <p>      <em>Just as a good singer, no matter how experienced,      continues to practice the scales, so a good gardener should      give thought again and again to the fundamental      principles.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Walker Abel and MOTHER's staff    </h5>        <p>      It wasn't that long ago that farmers were called      sodbusters-a term derogatory to people who worked      with the soil. Today, however, more and more men and women      seem to be eager to get out and bust some very special bits      of sod-their home gardens.    </p>    <p>      At MOTHER's Eco-Village, we look forward to that moment in      spring when the soil has warmed and dried enough to allow      digging to begin. From then on until early summer, our      backs will bend and our sweat will flow as the earth      beneath us is lifted, tilthed, and reawakened to its full      life.    </p>    <p>      This year, though, before beginning to break ground, let's      pause for a few minutes and review the basic reasons and      techniques for preparing the soil. This article will be of      special interest to people with new gardens, but it should      prove useful for experienced growers tending years-old      plots, as well.    </p>    <p>      Let's begin, then, with the "root" word . . .    </p>    <h3>      CULTIVATION    </h3>    <p>      Usually, we think of garden cultivation in terms of      plowing, tilling, digging, or hoeing-that is, simply      turning and loosening the soil. This is accurate as far as      it goes, but there's much more implied by the word cul      tivation, and no doubt the farmers of old intended for      these additional meanings to be understood when they chose      this term to describe their practices.    </p>    <p>      If a teacher stands before a class and says, "In this      school, we cultivate the characters of young men and      women," that person is stating his or her intent to      nurture, refine, and improve the students' basic natures.      These meanings are equally applicable in the garden. The      full intention of soil cultivation is to nurture and      improve the ground so that crops will grow better. And just      as the teacher who cultivates character must know what      attributes he or she wants the students to gain, so must      the gardener have a clear image of what he or she hopes to      achieve by working the soil.    </p>    <p>      For the <em>organic</em> grower, that image has two central      aspects: The soil should be loose, friable, and evenly      textured . . . and the life it contains should be fully      encouraged and nurtured.    </p>    <h3>      PART 1: SOIL TEXTURE    </h3>    <p>      It's said that the early Greeks began their transition to      agriculture when they observed that plants grew      particularly well in the loosened soil of a landslide. That      was the example in nature that they tried to imitate with      their digging and planting. (Nature also texturizes soil      through the action of glaciers, frost, wind, earthworms,      gophers, moles, the probing of deep-rooted plants, and so      on.) Whatever model you follow with your own      ground-disturbing activities, you'll be striving to loosen      the soil to a good depth and create an even texture in its      upper inches. Such cultivation-in the narrow sense of      the word-performs several important functions:    </p>    <p>      It provides aeration. Roots need oxygen in order to carry      on cell respiration and thus grow. Indeed, well-aerated      soil may be almost half air space!    </p>    <p>      It provides drainage. Most garden plants don't like soggy      soil. And the deeper the soil is dug, the better the      drainage.    </p>    <p>      It provides easy root movement. In compacted soil, the      roots must slowly pry their way down. This slows overall      growth. In loosened soil, the roots can move freely to get      the water and nutrients they need.    </p>    <p>      And it provides a good seedbed. The fine, even texture of      the upper inches allows the soil to snugly cradle each seed      and assures reliable germination.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you aren't likely to achieve such ideally      textured soil in your first gardening season, but you can      take a giant step toward that goal. Then again, you could      also take a giant step backward . . . if you're not      careful.    </p>    <p>      Many enthusiastic beginning gardeners rush outdoors and      work their soil before it's ready. It takes some experience      to know when the right time has come. The critical factor      is soil moisture: If your plot is either too wet or too dry      when you start to dig or till, you can cause serious damage      that may take years to heal. (This is particularly true of      clay soil; sandy soil is more forgiving.) Too wet ground      may turn into large, hard clumps that are difficult to      break, while overly dry soil may pulverize into such fine      dust that it loses all its texture.    </p>    <p>      Our Eco-Village soil is predominantly clay. Therefore, it's      very slow to warm and dry during our typically cool, wet      springs. Certain sections, however, have a higher content      of silt and sand. Because of the larger particle size of      those ingredients, these beds dry more quickly. Hence, we      use them for our early spring plantings of peas, fava      beans, and spinach.    </p>    <p>      To tell if all or part of your soil is ready to work, pick      up a clump in your hand and lightly roll it into a ball.      Then either drop it or prod it with a finger. If the ball      breaks easily into smaller sections, your soil is ready. If      it's still rubbery or puttylike, wait for drier weather. On      the other hand, if the clod is too dry (if it feels hard or      crumbles easily into small, brittle fragments), water the      ground thoroughly and check it again in another day or two.    </p>    <p>      You might also want to dig deeply into your garden to get a      general sense of its current quality. Dark red or brown      coloration is a sign of good drainage, while gray mixed      with yellow or red means your plot's drainage is probably      poor. Pale ground is subsoil: If that's all you've got,      your soil-building work is cut out for you! Mottled soil      may indicate that the water table sometimes rises near your      plot's surface. And black-ah, black-soil is rich in organic      matter.    </p>    <p>      If your ground's ready to work, first clear and remove the      dead weeds and crop residue . . . and scythe or mow down      any tall, live vegetation. You can then either rake this      growth off and compost it or-while it's still      green-turn it under. Note, however, that      cellulose-rich plant matter requires nitrogen to      break down, so if you till in the plant material, you'll      also be temporarily reducing your soil's supply of that      important nutrient. Wait a month after turning in green      matter before you plant.    </p>    <p>      You can, of course, choose one of several ways to break the      ground. If you have a small plot and a strong back, you can      dig the whole area by hand. As another option, you can rent      or buy a rotary tiller to work the plot. It may take a      large number of passes with the machine's tines set at      increasing depths, but eventually you should be able to      finely break up the top four to eight inches of soil. (For      help in choosing a tiller, turn to the buying guide on page      86.)    </p>    <p>      Then again, you may live in an area where you can pay a      tractor owner to plow and disk your plot. Although the      machine probably won't work the ground any deeper than a      tiller would, it will do the job more quickly and easily.      In fact, if you're preparing a large first -year garden on      a plot with a thick layer of sod, you'll definitely be      better off if you let a tractor do that initial ground      breaking.    </p>    <p>      At the Eco-Village, we work our garden primarily with hand      tools (although we have employed rotary tillers, a tractor,      and even a draft horse in some areas), using a process      called double-digging. This method, as many of you know,      involves loosening the soil with a spade and garden fork to      a depth of as much as 24 inches to better work in organic      matter and to promote texture deep in the soil. (See the      drawing on page 72.) The process demands a lot of hard work      . . . but the results usually justify the effort. In fact,      yields from double-dug beds can be four times as great as      those from conventionally dug areas! If you want to learn      more about the method, we heartily recommend reading John      Jeavons' <em>How</em> <em>to Grow More Vegetables</em> ,      available at many bookstores and libraries or, for $8.95      plus $1.50 shipping and handling, from Mother's Bookshelf,      105 Stoney Mountain Rd., Hendersonville, NC 28791.    </p>    <p>      While a lot of factors can influence vour choice of      ground-breaking technique, one element crucial to good soil      texture is depth. . .1 rotary tiller or tractor will do a      fine job of texturizing the top four to eight inches of      your plot, but those machines won't touch anything beneath      that. In fact, with repeated use they can actually compact      that subsoil into hardpan.    </p>    <p>      Double-digging, obviously, loosens soil to the greatest      depth . . . but it also takes the greatest amount of labor.      For a "middle ground" alternative, divide your tilled      garden into pathways and raised beds, and rake the loosened      pathway earth onto the beds: That'll help increase the      depth of texturized soil for your crops, no matter how you      initially break the ground! (Our 1984 Eco-Village      minigar-experiment-reported in our last issue showed that      crop yields in either a doubledug or rotary-tilled      raised-bed garden are superior to those in standard row      culture gardens.)    </p>    <h3>      PART II: SOIL LIFE    </h3>        <p>      So far we've covered mechanical and manual methods of soil      conditioning. This loosening can be likened to an      inhalation: The soil has fluffed and expanded as a chest      does when the lungs are filled. But just as our lungs are      not simply inert balloons but are alive with blood that      moves and uses this air, so the life in the soil responds      to the increased air flow, leading to fertility.    </p>    <p>      And the organisms that make up a living soil must be      carefully nurtured. They form an intricate system that is      by no means completely understood. According to one      estimate, a single teaspoonful of fertile soil contains      4,000,000,000 bacteria, 40 to 100 meters of mold filament,      144,000,000 actinomycetes, and large quantities of algae      and other microorganisms. All of these, along with the      organic matter that sustains them, transform inert, mineral      dirt into healthy, living soil..    </p>    <p>      Such life-forms are important for a number of reasons. Like      some intestinal bacteria in animals, they digest nutrients      and change them into a form that higher organisms (in this      case, plants) are able to use. Also, by tying up nutrients      in their bodies as they grow and then dying and releasing      them, these organisms regulate the flow of food to the      plants and create a sustained fertility. In addition, their      excretions, sometimes called soil glue, bind earthen      particles into small aggregates, helping to build a loose,      friable soil.    </p>    <p>      These beneficial microorganisms will not live in a soil      that is fertilized only with chemicals. They rely, instead,      upon a steady sup ply of actively decomposing organic      matter for their food and energy. (Note the word steady:      Organic matter needs to be supplied on an on-going basis.)    </p>    <p>      And important as its role of supporting microorganisms is,      organic matter does even more. It helps aerate the soil      (aha, more texture building!), retains water through dry      periods, holds nutrients that would otherwise be leached      out by rains, and-unlike chemical      fertilizers-releases these nutrients slowly as its      decomposition proceeds.    </p>    <p>      At the Eco-Village, we spread one inch of fresh compost      over the surface of every just dug bed and then work this      material in with a fork so that it's dispersed through the      upper four to six inches of the soil. That is our      fundamental fertilization program. The compost will nurture      the crop throughout the season and leave some residue for      long-term soil improvement. (We do occasionally work in      some bonemeal to provide extra phosphorus, and hardwood      ashes for potash.)    </p>    <p>      When our compost production is high, we're able to add as      much as two or three inches of the homemade amendment per      bed to help build up the organic matter in the soil.      Ideally, a garden will eventually have a standing ratio of      at least 5% organic matter. (This can be difficult to      achieve in sandy soils or in regions with very hot      summers.)    </p>    <p>      There are, of course, other sources of organic matter for      your soil. In many areas, you can gather leaf mold from      municipal leaf dumps. This is an excellent, long-lasting      source of organic "fiber." (Use only well-decomposed mold,      not fresh leaves.) Well-aged manure is also effective. (If      you can only get hold of fresh, "hot" manure, compost it a      few months so it won't burn your plants.)    </p>    <p>      And you can raise your own organic matter by growing cover      crops like rye, hairy vetch, or buckwheat and then      composting or turning them under. (Remember to wait a month      before planting after turning under green matter.)    </p>    <p>      Building up the life and organic matter in your soil is an      ongoing, never-ending garden task. You'll want to work each      year at "growing" good soil, just as you'll work at growing      good crops. Eventually, you should be able to maintain your      soil's health and fertility by doing little more than      proper composting, crop rotation, and cover cropping.    </p>    <p>      However, because most soils have been mistreated in the      past-through poor agricultural practices or by natural      erosionthey need some initial "medicinal" help to reach a      sustainable level of fertility.    </p>    <p>      Experienced farmers of old could look at the relative      quantities of various weeds or the way crops were growing      and diagnose their soils. (The late Peter Escher, a      biodynamic agricultural consultant, once outlined a program      for improving the soil at Eco-Village after simply tasting      one of our carrots!) Such "living soil analyses" can be      extremely accurate, since they reveal how the soil is      actually functioning in relation to plant growth.    </p>    <p>      Of course, very few people today have such observational      skills. Most of us must rely on chemical soil tests to gain      some sense of our plots' strengths and weaknesses. You can      buy a kit at a garden supply store or get a test done      through your county extension service. (John Jeavons,      author of How to Grow More Vegetables, thinks the La Motte      kit Model STH4 is best. It's available for $104.38 plus      shipping from La Motte Chemical Products, Box 329,      Chestertown, MD 21620. La Motte sells a smaller kit for the      home gardener for $25.30 plus shipping. Jeavons feels,      though, that a large kit such as the STH4 is less likely to      produce errors.) Don't rely completely on any test      results-the accuracy of soil testing is a subject of      much controversy-but do use them to identify glaring      deficiencies you should address.    </p>    <h3>      POTENTIAL HYDROGEN    </h3>        <p>      <em>First, a spade-wide layer of topsoil is removed from      Strip A. Next, after the lower layer of soil in that trench      is loosened with a garden fork, topsoil from Strip B is      shoveled into the ditch in Strip A, and the dirt in the      lower level of Strip B is loosened. This process is      repeated down the row to the end of the bed. Finally, the      topsoil from Strip A is used to fill in the remaining      ditch.</em>    </p>    <p>      The first thing you should test for is pH, that indicator      of acidity or alkalinity. Balanc ing your garden's pH is      important, because a soil that's too acidic (a pH of 6.0 or      lower) or too alkaline (a pH of 8.0 or higher) will tie up      essential minerals in the earth, making them unavailable to      your vegetables.    </p>    <p>      If your soil is too acidic, you'll need to add limestone or      hardwood ashes to your gardenon the day you break      ground-to increase the pH. Be sure, though, to use      only agricultural-grade (not hydrated, or slaked) lime . .      . and if you have a choice, opt for dolomitic limestone      rather than calcic limestone, because of the former's more      favorable magnesium content. To raise your soil's pH one      full point, you'll need at least 3 pounds of finely ground      limestone per 100 square feet . . . and the denser your      soil is, the more limestone you'll have to add. (Very heavy      clays sometimes need as much as 8 pounds per 100 square      feet.) Alternatively, hardwood ashes-which are      fasteracting-can be applied at roughly the same rate      as lime. Actually, you might be wise to use a combination      of ashes and limestone, to give your garden both an      immediate and a sustained boost.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, your garden may be      alkaline-particularly if you live in the      Southwest-in which case you'll need to reduce the pH.      A one-inch layer of peat moss, worked into the earth when      you till or dig your plot, should lower the rating a point.      You can also use agricultural gypsum, at a rate of 2 pounds      per 100 square feet, for the same purpose.    </p>    <h3>      INORGANIC ELEMENTS    </h3>    <p>      After checking your soil's pH, you'll next be interested in      its nutritional balance. Of the 216 elements that most      affect plant growth, all but three must come from the soil.      (The exceptions are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which are      derived mainly from water and air.) And among the most      important of those remaining, nitrogen, phosphorus, and      potassium-the famous N, P, and K of commercial      fertilizer formulas-are generally classified as major      nutrients, while ten others are labeled minor, or trace,      elements.    </p>    <h3>      NITROGEN    </h3>    <p>      As most gardeners know, nitrogen is essential to plant      growth and vigor. It's often considered the nutrient that      most promotes leaf development. (How're your spinach      crops?) An ongoing supply of good compost and other organic      matter should take care of the nitrogen needs of a healthy      garden. To supplement the nitrogen of a soil that already      tests out very high in that element, Jeavons-again,      in his eminently useful book How to Grow More    </p>    <p>      Vegetables-recommends either .75 pound of blood meal      (14% N) . . . 1 pound of fish meal (10% N) . . . 2 pounds      of cottonseed meal (8% N) . . . or .75 pound of hoof and      horn meal (14% N) per 100 square feet of garden. For a      garden rated medium in nitrogen, he triples this dosage.      And he roughly quintuples the proportions for a plot ranked      very low in the element. In case you'd like to try working      out some substitutions of your own, feather meal contains      10 to 13% nitrogen, processed municipal sludge 4 to 5%,      poultry manure 4 to 6%, and most animal manures 2 to 4%.    </p>    <h3>      PHOSPHORUS    </h3>    <p>      Phosphorus promotes cell division, root development,      and-most notably-fruit growth. If your soil      tests show a very low phosphorus content, or if last year      your green crops exhibited a reddish purple coloration in      their stems and leaf veins, or if your fruiting crops were      leafy but unproductive (never did get any tomatoes, you      say?), you may need to add this element to your soil. For      soils already rated very high in phosphorus, Jeavons      recommends either 1 pound of bonemeal (24 to 28% P) or 2      pounds finely ground phosphate rock (30% P, but      slow-releasing). He doubles the dose for ground rated      medium and triples it for plots rated very low. Colloidal      phosphate (20% P) and single superphosphate (20% P) are      other good-and relatively fast-acting-sources.    </p>    <h3>      POTASSIUM    </h3>    <p>      Also known as potash, potassium is vital for cell division      and growth, helps plants form strong stems and fight off      disease, and promotes root growth. (Have a problem with      your root crops last year? Notice a lot of yellow-streaked      leaves and spindly plants?) For plots with a very high      potassium rating, Jeavons recommends 1 pound of kelp meal      (3% K) . . . 2 pounds of greensand (7% K) . . . or 3 pounds      of crushed granite (4% K). For soil rated medium in potash,      he suggests 1 pound of kelp plus 1.33 pounds of greensand      (or 2 pounds of crushed granite) . . . 3.33 pounds of      greensand . . . or 5 pounds of crushed granite. And for      very low-rated soil, he doubles all of the "medium" numbers      except the kelp. (Because kelp meal contains some growth      hormones, Jeavons feels you should never add more than a      pound of it per 100 square feet per year.) Some other      organic sources of potash are feldspar dust (5-15%0), wood      ashes (8% and sulphate of potash-magnesia-or      Sul-po-mag-(22%).    </p>    <h3>      TRACE ELEMENTS    </h3>    <p>      These micronutrients-boron, calcium, chlorine,      copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, sulfur, and      zinc-are necessary in smaller amounts than nitrogen,      phosphorus, or potassium, but, like the spices in a good      recipe, are no less important to the end result.    </p>    <p>      Not only are trace elements valuable as direct nutrients,      but they also work as catalysts to prompt chemical      reactions that dissolve other soilborne minerals, making      them available to plants. Many of the ten micronutrients,      in fact, work best only when present in proper proportion      with others.    </p>    <p>      Good composting and other soil-building practices should      provide a balanced meal of trace elements in the long run.      If you want to give your plot a trace-element boost      now-or periodically-seaweed (kelp) is an      excellent source. Apply a pound of seaweed meal (or 3      pounds of raw seaweed) per 100 square feet of soil area.      Another good, commercially available source is FTE (fritted      trace elements).    </p>    <h3>      COMPLETE ORGANIC FERTILIZERS    </h3>    <p>      You can buy or make balanced organic fertilizers to help      boost your garden's soil quality. At the Eco-Village we've      often used Erth-Rite fertilizer on poor soils. (It's      available in different blends from Zook & Ranck, Rt. 1,      Gap, PA 17527.

Below are three of      Lee's formulas. Each makes about 100 pounds of fertilizer      and provides at least 3% nitrogen, 6% phosphorus, and 6%      potash. Lee recommends applying a total of 4 pounds of      these mixtures per 100 square feet of garden per season      (applied both throughout the garden and under seed rows      prior to planting) if-in his words-"you want to      grow a garden that'll impress the neighbors."    </p>		       <p>      A good mail-order source for most of these supplements, in      case you want to purchase some to remedy specific      deficiencies or make your own fertilizer, is Necessary      Trading Company, 328 Main St., New Castle, VA 24127.    </p>    <h3>      THE BEGINNING    </h3>    <p>      Most of the steps we've focused on in this article are      meant to be beginnings.

Next, after the lower layer of soil in that trench is loosened with a garden fork, topsoil from Strip B is shoveled into the ditch in Strip A, and the dirt in the lower level of Strip B is loosened. This process is repeated down the row to the end of the bed. Finally, the topsoil from Strip A is used to fill in the remaining ditch.
