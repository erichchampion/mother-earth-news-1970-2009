                    <h5 id="byline">      by RUTH MOOSE    </h5>        <p>      The large cable reels emptied by utility companies can be      converted into attractive lamp tables with very little      time, effort or money.    </p>    <p>      These reels, called spools, come in several sizes and are      free for the asking. The only other components you'll need      for a lamp table are an old workable floorlamp, which can      be bought at a thrift shop (the one in the photo cost      75 cents); a round circle of plywood, (these can be found      in construction site trash piles); some paint; and a lamp      shade. Try the discount stores for a shade (the      burlap-textured one shown here cost only $3.00).    </p>    <p>      Disassemble the spool, saving all hardware and sand, then      stain or paint the reel (antiquing is perfect). Paint the      lamp parts and the plywood the same color as the base.    </p>    <p>      Reassemble the spool, insert the shaft of the lamp through      the reel's center and cut the circle of plywood to fit      around the shaft.    </p>    <p>      The bottom shelf is just right for a circular bookcase.    </p>
