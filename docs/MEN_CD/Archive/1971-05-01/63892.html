                    <p>      <em>If the good earth farm came about through searching for      a way of life. I was not content with what I had come to      realize through my own ego-pursuits and certainly there was      little glory to be found in the method and achievements of      my society.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Maybe I was tired ~ tired of toiling and killing and of      trying to live up to the expectations of others when, hell,      I couldn't even live up to my own.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So I asked around a lot, but it always come back the      same,"This<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>is a cruel world, boy, you've got to get out there and      struggle and fight hard. "Well, I had got out there and      struggled and fought hard, but it always came both pretty      much the same ~ more struggling and more fighting.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>But then I came upon a verse in the Bible, somewhere in      Matthew, Jesus said: "Consider the lillies of the valley,      how they grow; they toil not..."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Everything's been fine since. The earth is good, and we      have a lot of fun."</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      <em>by Gene Le Roy</em>    </h5>    <p>      <strong>From an article by ANN NUGENT<br /></strong>      <strong>Originally published in NORTHWEST PASSAGE, Box 705,      So Bellingham Station, Bellingham, Washington      90225/fortnightly/$6.00 a year.</strong> <strong><br />      </strong>    </p>    <p>      Gene and Charlotte LeRoy have found a haven on Guemes      Island in Washington state's Puget Sound. The dirt road      leading into their property from the highway tunnels      through woods and the first sign of their homestead is the      four-acre orchard. Over to the left stretches three acres      of pasture . . . the LeRoy's 75-year-old, two-story wood      house is visable beyond that . . . and four sloping acres      where the vegetables grow lie still further on. Woods      completely surround the clearing.    </p>    <p>      The LeRoys own 16 acres and make their living farming      organically. They sell vegetables to friends on the island,      in the nearby mainland town of Anacortes and to the Kagetsu      Restaurant in Seattle's University district. Their produce      is good: demand exceeded supply last year and the LeRoys      are increasing their cultivation this season.    </p>    <p>      To Gene and Charlotte, farming organically is a way of life      and they've chosen to use their resources and ingenuity in      a bold attempt to reclaim land that agronomists have      labeled unsuitable for farming.    </p>    <p>      "Those governmental officials are always on a negative      trip," Gene told us. "They're always good at telling you      what NOT to do. They claimed that my soil is a glaciated      type and, therefore, is too rocky and barren-compared      to fertile river beds-to farm. That's a lot of bull."    </p>    <p>      The LeRoys prefer a more positive approach. They're quite      pleased, for instance, that their land (no doubt partly due      to those agronomists' warnings) has lain fallow for 30      years. That's good, they feel, because-as a      result-the farm is almost entirely uncontaminated by      the recent abusive use of pesticides, herbicides and      commercial fertilizers.    </p>    <p>      Like all good organic farmers, Gene and Charlotte are more      interested in building a good life than they are in making      fast, easy profits. They regard working in the soil and      growing seeds as a pleasure in itself and they don't mind      adapting themselves to the peculiar conditions of their      land. The LeRoys' four-acre vegetable patch slopes gently      downhill, for instance, so they plow and plant the upper      level while the lower section is still too wet to work.      Later, the hot weather plants are seeded in the low land      where they'll find moisture during the dry season.    </p>    <p>      Gene insists that proper seed selection is essential and he      never buys seeds that come from the east or south. "I use      only seeds that friends give me or that I get from      Tillinghasts's Seed Co. in LaConner, Washington," he says.    </p>    <p>      "Tillinghast's seeds are produced locally and are better      acclimated to my peculiar soil conditions and climate.      Eventually I'll develop my own seeds and they should      produce an even more satisfying crop."    </p>    <p>      Signs of Gene's experiments are obvious on the homestead.      The thick sod in the apple orchard-neglected for 30      years-needed work so he's plowed the four acres and      sowed cowpeas. The long, leguminous roots of the cowpeas      will help loosen the soil and supply nitrogen to it;      they'll also produce edible peas, make good forage for the      goats and provide "green manure " for composting.    </p>    <p>      Hand-made cold frames rest near the house. The simple      wooden box frames, about five feet by three feet, are      topped by old windows and the frames protect tender      cabbage, brussel sprout, broccoli, cauliflower and other      seedlings from frost. In this way, the plants are given a      headstart so they can be harvested before the summer heat.    </p>    <p>      Gene plans to make a hot bed soon with a $7.00 20-foot-long      cable that he's bought. He'll lay the cable underground,      start peppers and cucumbers over it and enclose it all in a      frame topped by an old window of many panes. The steady      heat will give the hot weather plants the push they need.    </p>    <p>      Gene is also building a new greenhouse and chicken coop      over near the pasture where the five goats romp. He's dug      an excavation in the shape of a cross approximately 50 feet      by 50 feet and plans to put the structures on top of the      site. The coop will house 100 chickens fed on organic grain      shipped from California and its floor will be layered with      hay. At regular intervals the manure-hay mixture will be      shovelled through a trap door into compost heaps under the      buildings. The heat generated from the composting should      give adequate warmth to the greenhouse and chicken coop.    </p>    <p>      Making compost is nothing new for the LeRoys. They used to      make tons of it when they lived in Blaine, Washington and      they even sold it commercially there. Gene now uses the      same techniques to produce humus in the same large      quantities . . . but he plows it all into the fields of the      LeRoy homestead.    </p>    <p>      Charlotte and Gene invited us into the house for a cup of      tea before we left and we found their cozy living-kitchen      to be a double room dominated by a large wood-burning cook      stove. To the sides were a weaving loom, piano, re cord      player and stacks of books . . . but the large table near      one window caught our attention.    </p>    <p>      That table held a couple dozen half-gallon milk containers      laid on their sides, split lengthwise and filled with soil.      Imbedded in the cartons were many varieties of eggplant,      grapefruit, water cress, sweet marjoram, savory, basil and      other seeds. Several avacado seeds, suspended by toothpicks      in bowls of water, sat nearby. "You can grow anything,"      Charlotte insisted. "When our greenhouse is built, we're      going to try growing oranges, figs . . . everything."    </p>    <p>      We had heard of the difficulties of finding a good soil mix      for starting seeds and we asked Charlotte what she used in      the cartons on the table.    </p>    <p>      "A mixture of humus, sand and loam topped with a sprinkling      of vermiculite," she told us. "I hike over to the woods and      dig up rich leaf mold but it's apt to be too acid so I have      to be careful and not use too much."    </p>    <p>      We mentioned that many commercial enterprises sterilize      their potting soil to prevent damping off.    </p>    <p>      "You don't need to do that," she insisted. "It's      unnecessary. Humus is light and spongy and, mixed with      loam, it's an ideal medium. I've never had trouble with      damping off."    </p>    <p>      A large wire drying rack suspended from the ceiling over      the stove held a goatskin. At other times during the year,      we were told, the rack is apt to be loaded with edibles      such as orange peels, parsley and sliced apples.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">    <p>      <strong>GENE LEROY'S RECIPE FOR MAKING HUMUS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Break up the ground so it will act as a starting agent.    </p>    <p>      Add 6 inches of organic matter: grass clippings, hay,      leaves.    </p>    <p>      Add two inches of cow manure or a half inch of chicken      manure.    </p>    <p>      Add a sprinkling of dirt.    </p>    <p>      Repeat until 5 feet high, and at least 4 feet wide. This      height will give the proper compression necessary to      produce 160 degree heat.    </p>    <p>      Soak with water, but not too much.    </p>    <p>      Climb on top and punch holes deeply with a sturdy pole to      aerate.    </p>    <p>      Turn the pile over every 10 days.    </p>    <p>      Humus will be ready in about two months.    </p>    </div>    <p>      The weaving in process on the loom contained various      textures of weeds, mosses and spun fibres . . . and it was      good to sit at a hand-made wood table sipping tea made of      rose hips, catnip and peppermint . . . eating dried apples      dipped in honey . . . and listening to Charlotte explain      her recipe for goat's milk cheese.    </p>    <p>      Outside, it was a rare sunny day and it also felt good to      walk around on the LeRoy's farm and play with their goats      We were sorry to leave the tranquil retreat but we had to      catch the ferry and Gene and Charlotte undoubtedly were      eager to make the most of the lovely day by working in      their fields.    </p>    <p>      "It's a lot of work . . . but never toil," Gene said. "What      you need, though, is faith. Faith that whatever you attempt      to do will work out OK."    </p>
