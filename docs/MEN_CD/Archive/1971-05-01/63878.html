                <p>      Marshall Efron demonstrates how you, too can make lemon      cream pie without lemons and without cream. Photo/LNS,    </p>        <p>      <em>A partial transcript</em> of <em>Marshall Effron's      recent production on educational TV's THE GREA T AMERICAN      DREAM MACHINE:'.</em>    </p>        <p>      Here is a pie you can make with the same ingredients that      the manufacturer uses and lists on the box. The same      ingredients that I have right here. We'll make the crust      first. Let's begin with some wheat flour. That's always      good when you're making a crust. Just pour it right through      the sifter and make sure that any dross or detritus is      caught by the mesh of the sifter.    </p>    <p>      Now we're going to put some sugar in to make it sweet. Then      a little shortening.    </p>    <p>      Now, to make it stay moist and loose you want to put some      water in. And a little sweetening from our friend      dextrose-hospital tested, hospital approved.    </p>    <p>      Now we want to mix a little sorghum flour with a little      grain flour. There's some grain flour. Mix that around and      put your sorghum flour in there too and just let it all go      in. Make sure you're getting all the impurities out.    </p>    <p>      Okay, add a little dash of salt to give it some power and      strength so it can stand there proud. Here's some sodium      bicarbonate. And here's its antidote, ammonium bicarbonate.      They think of everything don't they?    </p>    <p>      You might have some trouble finding these, but if you ask      around, you might get these ingredients from some friends      of yours, if you know any druggists or chemists. And what's      a pie without a little artificial flavoring and coloring?      Let's put it in there so it looks appetizing. That's fine.      We'll just let that set chemically and heat up by itself      and go over and make the body of the pie.    </p>    <p>      We're going to start with water. Just lay that water right      in the bowl. And add some corn syrup. It's thick and it's      sweet, and it's just fine. Lays right in there with the      water. Great. Here's some shortening. You have shortening      in both sides, in the crust and in the body. More sugar      just to make it sweet.    </p>    <p>      And now we get to the interesting part. Here are whey      solids. Lay that right in there. Mix it around. That's      dairy-fresh, dairy-approved.    </p>    <p>      Now we're going to food starch modified. What are the      modifications? No one knows, but they've been modified for      some years. That sits in there. Makes it thick too.    </p>    <p>      More dextrose. More sweets behind the sweets. Here's some      sodium caseinate. Remember the word "casein"? You see it in      glue and paints. This is something different, though. It's      a dairy product as well, and not bad for you nutritionally.      That's good.    </p>    <p>      Now we come to an important part. Time to add the      flavoring. This is what distinguishes our pies from other      pies. It has a certain amount of flavor. That's good. Some      gelatin to give that flavoring a little gush and make it      stand tall and proud in the world of pies. Real gelatin.    </p>    <p>      Now we put some whole milk solids, also a very wonderful      natural dairy item. That's good. Monosodium and      diglyceride. This is an emulsifier to make it hang      together. Hang together and stay sloppy in your tummy.      Another dash of salt. Just a little. Just a dash, like      snow. Isn't that pretty?    </p>    <p>      A taste of vinegar to give it that old tartness. But be      careful you don't put too much vinegar in. If you do the      kids will be turning their noses up at it, saying you make      a vinegar pie, and you don't want to do that.    </p>    <p>      Polysorbate number sixty. Not fifty-eight or fifty-nine or      sixty-one. If you have trouble finding this, your local      organic chemical supply house will probably have a little      for you. This is an emulsifier and it also retards      spoilage. So many pies these days are spoiling right and      left. This one doesn't spoil after you keep it for seven or      eight months.    </p>    <p>      Here's some vanilla to counteract the vinegar and add a      little more flavoring. That's fine. And our old friend      monosodium phosphate. Can be found in laxatives and      detergents. Cleans all kinds of tubes out and you'll have a      clean pie. We'll just lay this in right here. You don't      want to put in too much. Acts like Drano or something.    </p>    <p>      And what's a pie without a little artificial color? Just a      couple drops. Not too much. You don't want it to clash with      the walls or the curtains.    </p>    <p>      You may wonder what kind of pie we've made here. I'll show      you exactly what kind of pie it is. There it is. A modern      lemon cream pie. I'll open it for you. Get it out of the      box. Good. Factory-fresh, factory approved. No lemons, no      eggs, no cream. Just pie.    </p>
