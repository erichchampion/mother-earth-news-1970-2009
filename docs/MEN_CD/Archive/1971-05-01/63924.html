        	         <h5 id="byline">      by CHARLES WORTH    </h5>       <p>      Here's photos of two tipis I've built and lived in. The      unique thing about them is that they didn't cost me any      money at all.    </p>    <p>      The tipi with its cover partially removed was 18 feet in      diameter. The framework was eucalyptus and the cover was      old rugs from trash cans and black plastic from the      railroad yards. All the materials were free.    </p>    <p>      When the picture was taken, the south wall had been lowered      to air and dry the interior between the rainstorms that      caused the Los Angeles floods of January and February,      1969. The tipi was one of the safest places to be      throughout those storms.    </p>    <p>      There was room for six people in that tent and-quite      often on weekends-seven or eight folks would sleep      there. I lived in the tipi for three months and, once the      police helicopters discovered it, they circled the tent      three times a day.    </p>    <p>      The other tipi is a 12-foot model I built in the Colorado      Rockies at an elevation of about 11,000 feet. The cover was      20-ounce canvas and the tent was an excellent shelter for      below-freezing weather and light snows.    </p>    <p>      I highly recommend tipis for temporary housing.    </p>
