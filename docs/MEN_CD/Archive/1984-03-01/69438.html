                <p>      <em>You want sew your own outdoors gear? Then start by      ....</em>    </p>        <h3>      OUTDOOR GEAR    </h3>        <p>      Most of the "make your own" articles we've collected for      this outdoors primer lean heavily toward the rustic      and-in a few cases-the downright      <em>crude.</em> And there's nothing wrong with that . . .      we like rough-and-ready projects, or we certainly wouldn't      be recommending them to you! However, what if you want      something extra <em>nice . . .</em> like, say, a      Thinsulate-lined winter parka with hood? Well, unless you      are a seamstress (or seamster) <em>extraordinaire,</em>      that project would entail a bite of work that might prove      to be a little too big to chew. And if you tried to      <em>buy</em> such a coat, you could expect to spend about      $125!    </p>    <p>      So there you sit, perched uncomfortably atop the horns of a      dilemma . . . damned if you do (try to design, cut, and sew      the parka yourself, that is) and broke if you don't (and      opt instead to <em>buy</em> the darned thing).    </p>    <p>      But wait! There <em>is</em> a solution: You could purchase      a sew-your-own <em>kit</em> that comes with all the parts      precut and marked so that all you have to do is follow a      set of detailed instructions. And that $125 winter parka      can be yours, in kit form, for $66.50. That's a saving of      nearly <em>half!</em>    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, for the moderately experienced seamstress or      seamster, kits can offer more than economy: They can be      downright <em>instructive</em> in the ways of the      stitch-and-hem, putting you several steps closer to      actually being able to make your gear from scratch. And      too, a kit-produced garment can give you the satisfaction      of having done something for yourself, of having climbed a      little farther out of the consumer rut.    </p>    <p>      But-you may well be wondering-what potential      problems lie in wait for the wouldbe kit completer?    </p>    <p>      Well, our collective hands-on experience says to take the      <em>"Anybody</em> can do it, even if you have <em>no</em>      sewing experience!" come-on with a grain or two of salt. Of      course, each kitmaker's products are different. But you      <em>do</em> need a basic knowledge of sewing and its      jargon-and, of course, a sewing machine-to      breeze through a-kit project.    </p>    <p>      Two down-filled parkas and a sleeping      bag/comforter-all three items made from      kits-were stitched together by one of MOTHER's      friends way back in 1974, and we can attest that all of      them are still going strong and looking good! So,      <em>yes,</em> kits can help you to save substantial money      and still have the very best . . . if you can <em>find</em>      what you want in kit form today.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE TIMES, THEY ARE A-CHANGIN'</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before we dove into the research for this article, we      envisioned it as little more than a catalog of the many      sources available for mail-ordering those moneysaving      outdoorsgear kits. We started, in fact, with a list of no      less than a <em>dozen</em> reputable suppliers and hoped to      turn up even more. But it's strange the things a little      digging can unearth, things that are often totally      unexpected . . . and what we wound up with is a story about      the growth, <em>overgrowth,</em> and subsequent near-demise      of the outdoors-gear kit industry. In short, there remains      today only one large-scale supplier, and even that one      lonely outfit-Altra, Inc., of Boulder,      Colorado-has drifted away from backpacking and      camping <em>gear . . . and</em> specializes instead in      fashionable outdoors <em>clothing,</em> especially apparel      for the ski slopes.    </p>    <p>      And behind that news-as you may well suspect-hangs a tale.    </p>    <p>      It was only a handful of years ago that those dozen or so      kit-makers were going strong, with Frostline (the outfit      that started it all back in 1966) well in the lead,      followed close at heel by Holubar and the other, smaller,      outfits. Both Frostline and Holubar were founded by      outdoors folk who knew and cared about their products      <em>and</em> their customers. And, for a while there, it      looked as if they'd tapped into a market with no bounds,      one which promised to stretch beyond the 50-million-a-year      sales figure and threatened to make deep slashes across the      heart of the retail ready-made market. Well, the aroma of      <em>that</em> kind of money is bound-sooner or      later-to attract the big fish . . . and it did.    </p>    <p>      And the offers those big fish dangled under the noses of      the two leading little guys were too tempting to pass up.      As a result, <em>both</em> of the kit-industry leaders sold      out . . . Frostline to Gillette, and Holubar to Johnson's      Wax. Holubar has since been sold, by Johnson's Wax, to      North Face (a one-time Holubar competitor) and has departed      not only from the <em>kit</em> market but from its      mail-order endeavors, too. Holubar is now strictly a      retail-outlet operation offering <em>no</em> kits.    </p>    <p>      And Frostline has fallen on <em>very</em> hard times      indeed. In early 1982, Gillette's Frostline sold 14 retail      stores, reverting to a lower-overhead, mail-order      operation. Then-in February, 1983-when things      hadn't improved and Gillette couldn't find a buyer for the      now-on-the-market Frostline, the firm decided to liquidate      its substantial inventory in order to lower the selling      price, and so closed down its <em>production</em>      facilities.    </p>    <p>      As this issue of MOTHER goes off to the printer, it looks      as if-unless a buyer appears <em>real</em>      soon-Frostline will rest in peace by the time you      read these words. However, if you've recently purchased a      kit from Frostline, there's no reason to go into shock,      since the folks there assure us that they will honor their      warranties right up to the last kit sold . . . and, as long      as supplies hold out, they'll keep someone around to      "correct kit problems" up through June 1984. Frostline has      always enjoyed a good reputation, and-from all      appearances-it intends to keep that good name right      to the very last. The outfit has been around a long while      now, and more than a few folks hate to see it go . . .      including many of us here at MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      And what about those other, smaller kitmakers? Well,      they've all fallen along the way, for various reasons,      leaving Altra as the only "old fish" (it's been around for      nine years now) in what was once a very well-stocked      kitmaker pond.    </p>    <p>      Then again, a few <em>new</em> guys have jumped into the      business of late . . . but, like Altra, they're      specializing in clothing and other items (stuffed animals,      for one!) that are even <em>less</em> related to the      outdoorsperson's needs. As far as we've been able to      determine (and we've searched far and wide), there is      currently <em>no</em> manufacturer offering kits for      backpacks or tents. Furthermore, the only sleeping bag kit      available is from Altra, and <em>that</em> product isn't      even listed in the firm's current catalog (the bag is      described in a separate brochure, which you have to request      <em>in addition to</em> the free catalog).    </p>    <p>      What's happened here? How did a thriving outdoors-goodies      kit market shrivel and all but die? Well, it's logical to      surmise, at least in the cases of Frostline and Holubar,      that when they were bought by megacorporations that      expected to make megabucks, expenditures for advertising      and promotion and facilities and inventory and employees      and corporate bureaucracy-overhead in      general-went up. And, of course, higher overhead      demands higher profits, and higher profits necessitate      higher prices, and you can guess the rest from there.    </p>    <p>      But that's only conjecture on our part. What both Frostline      and Holubar say accounts for the demise of the      outdoors-gear kit industry is more <em>market-</em>      oriented, and includes several elements. First of all,      times have been hard of late, forcing more women to take      jobs . . . thus leaving them with less time (and energy)      for sewing projects. The second element is the      comparatively recent introduction-and aggressive      marketing-of (primarily Oriental) imported outdoors      gear that sells, ready to pack into the field, for less      than the prices at which the American companies are able to      offer <em>kits!</em> And while corporate inefciency      probably can't be totally dismissed as a causal factor,      there's no doubt it's true that-as Holubar and      Frostline say-in this throwaway age, price is often a      more important criterion for buying than is quality.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TIME TO SET THE SWANS A-SINGING?</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Still, the kit industry is far from rehearsing its swan      song. Sure, we'd like to see someone step in and take up      where Frostline-for <em>whatever</em>      reasons-has been forced to leave off . . . and at      least one manufacturer is considering testing that tempting      water. But for now, the cost-conscious out-doorsperson can      at least take advantage of what <em>is</em> available . . .      a good assortment of outdoors <em>clothing</em> (and that      one elusive Altra sleeping bag).    </p>    <p>      Consult the accompanying sidebar for names, addresses, and      brief descriptions of a trio of kit-makers . . . one      survivor (Altra), and a couple of new contenders. Somewhere      in one of their catalogs you might find your fancy, new,      low-cost whatever!    </p>    <div class="sidebar">    <h3>      KIT-MAKERS   <br />      (AND THE KITS THEY MAKE)    </h3>    <p>      <em>After a long, hard search, we've had to conclude that      the companies listed below represent the totality of      kit-makers who offer at least some outdoors-type clothing      and/or equipment. Of course, it's entirely possible that      there are other sporting goods kit-makers out there      somewhere . . . but if there are, they're staying well      hidden, and we haven't been able to turn up hide nor hair      of them (if any more should ever emerge from their dens,      we'll try to let you know). So-for now, at      least-look over the three outfits enumerated below .      . . send off for their catalogs (two out of three are free)      . . . compare merchandise and prices . . . and make the      best of what's available.<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Timberline Sewing Kits</strong><br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      Clark Street, Box 126<br />      Pittsfield, New Hampshire 03263<br />      Timberline is a small, family-run business specializing in      making beginner-level<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>kits for school use (crafts classes and the like). It      does, however, offer a few items that might be of interest      to the sporting seamstress or seamster . . . including a      variety of bags, a day pack, vests, jackets, a mountain      parka, a pullover shell jacket, gaiters, stuff sacks (the      largest of which is suitable for holding a sleeping bag),      and a backpacking poncho (the back is cut long to go over a      large pack). The free, eight-page brochure lists 24 kits in      all.<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Altra, Inc.</strong><br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      5541 Central Avenue<br />      Boulder, Colorado 80301<br />      At this time, Altra is the largest manufacturer of      outdoors-related kits, has been in the business the      longest, and offers the biggest selection. Furthermore,      with the majority of the big-league competition washed away      on the flood tide of hard economic times, it looks as      though Altra<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      might <em>dive back into the backpacking and camping</em>      equipment <em>kit market . . . so when you write, tell the      folks there what you'd like to see added to their offerings      (they've assured us that they'll be listening to what you      have to say). For now, you can get nylon and bunting      jackets, insulated vests, parkas, gaiters, coveralls,      knickers, fanny packs, bike bags, shorts, rainwear, and a      variety of other clothing items. Altra has a reputation for      providing its customers with large, easy-to-follow, and      even humorous instructions and diagrams.<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>SunDown Kits</strong><br />      Dept.
