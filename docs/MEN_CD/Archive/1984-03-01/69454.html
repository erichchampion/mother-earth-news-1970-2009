                		<h5 id="byline">By Bill McLarney</h5>        <p>      The farm pond is something of an American institution.      After all, we've been building ponds and stocking them with      fish for as long as there have been farms in this country.      And for good reason: For a minimal outlay of cash and      labor, a pond not only provides the enterprising      homesteader with a means of home fish production but also      furnishes water for livestock and crops, creates wildlife      habitats, offers a source of recreation, <em>and</em> adds      an aesthetically pleasing element to his or her property.    </p>    <p>      The considerable virtues of the farm pond were perhaps      given their widest acclaim during the Great Depression-Dust      Bowl years of the late 1930's and early 40's, when the      newly formed U.S. Soil Conservation Service began to      promote such bodies of water as aids to soil and water      conservation, and as sources of food and recreation. As a      consequence of the original SCS program, the term <em>farm      pond</em> has come to mean a <em>particular</em> type of      pond . . . specifically, a 1/4- to 5-acre artificial body      of water stocked with warm-water fish that reproduce      naturally within the pond environment. Because food      production is just one of the many purposes of the pond,      the fish populations are not intensively managed (as they      would be in commercial aquaculture operations). Harvesting      is done by hook and line, and the fish are intended for      home use rather than for sale.    </p>    <p>      There are now more than two million farm ponds in the      United States, and-as might be expected-an      orthodoxy of farm pond management practices has developed      over the years. One tradition concerns the stocking      technique. SCS and state conservation agents almost      invariably tell prospective pond-builders to stock their      home-scale reservoirs with a mixture of largemouth bass      <em>(Micropterus salmoides)</em> and bluegill sunfish      <em>(Lepomis macrochirus).</em> When an inquisitive farmer      asks about stocking other fish species, he or she is      usually just told that it "won't work". In fact,      experimental pond stocking is discouraged primarily for two      reasons: First, since certain species or species      combinations have been shown to be detrimental to the farm      pond ecosystem, a concerted effort is made to avoid those      possible groupings . . . and second, extension workers are      trained in the current doctrine: Their job is to offer      practical advice, not to oversee experimental projects.    </p>    <p>      However, as this article will point out, there <em>are</em>      perfectly suitable substitutes for and supplements to      largemouth bass and bluegills . . . and there's plenty of      room for more experimentation, too. In the following      paragraphs I'll discuss some of these alternatives, as well      as a few of the popular fish that generally <em>are      not</em> suitable for the farm pond.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NOTE ABOUT NICHES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before you begin to dabble with stocking alternative      species of fish, it's important to have a clear      understanding of how the typical scheme works. The      bluegill, the smaller of the two members in the classic      farm pond community, is stocked in greater numbers than the      largemouth bass. As a <em>panfish,</em> the bluegill      provides the bulk of the catch and serves as a food source      for the bass. The bass, then, provides more exciting      recreational fishing while acting as a <em>predator,</em>      controlling the bluegill population so that stunting of      these rapid reproducers doesn't occur. However, this theory      works well in practice <em>only</em> when the pond owner      aids the bass by regularly harvesting the bluegills.      Furthermore, as long as the fish are reproducing naturally      in the pond, this rule will hold true . . .      <em>regardless</em> of what species are added or      substituted. So although it may be more challenging to      pursue the larger fish, you'll find that the key to      maintaining a balanced population is to harvest a far      greater proportion of panfish than predators.    </p>    <p>      <em>Alternative</em> species, therefore, may be predators      (occupying a niche corresponding to that of the largemouth      bass) or panfish (filling the role of the bluegill). There      is also a third possibility: the addition of      <em>forage</em> species-fish intended not for human      consumption but as a supplement to the predator's      diet-into the system. With this basic farm pond      scheme in mind, let's start at the top of the food chain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PREDATORS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Smallmouth bass</strong> <strong><em>(Micropterus      dolomieui):</em></strong> The most frequently considered      substitute for the largemouth bass is this close relative.      In fact, many anglers actually <em>prefer</em> to stock the      smallmouth bass because of its superior taste and sporting      qualities. But while the largemouth is content in water      temperatures of 80 Â°F or above, the smallmouth requires      a cooler environment ... and since the majority of farm      ponds reach temperatures in the 80's during summer, many      efforts to maintain smallmouth bass in home-scale      operations have failed. If your pond stays      <em>consistently</em> cool during the summer, however, you      might want to stock this species.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Catfish:</strong> In much of the U.S., the best      <em>supplemental species</em> to the largemouth bass are      the catfishes. And by far the most widely chosen species is      the channel catfish ( <em>Ictalurus</em> <em>punctatus</em>      ), simply because it's an important <em>commercially</em>      cultured fish, so stock for it <em>is</em> readily      available. The blue catfish <em>(</em> <em>Ifurcatus</em> )      and the white catfish <em>(</em> <em>I</em> <em>catus</em>      ) are said to be easier to catch on hook and line, while      the flathead catfish <em>(</em> <em>Pylodic</em> <em>tis      olivaris</em> )-though not as tasty as the other      cats-grows to an extreme size and can be particularly      helpful in controlling excess populations of forage fish.    </p>    <p>      Any of these large catfish will readily reproduce in farm      ponds if suitable nesting sites (which can be made by      sinking oldfashioned milk cans or similar-sized containers      in the pond) are available. One <em>disadvantage</em> of      stocking catfish and largemouth bass together, though, is      that the bass will eventually eliminate the catfish by      preying on their young.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chain pickerel</strong> (Esox niger): If I had a      farm pond anywhere on the Atlantic coastal plain from New      Brunswick to Florida, I'd consider stocking pickerel.      Although I don't know. of any farm ponds that are actually      <em>stocked</em> with pickerel, this species' favored      natural habitat is small bodies of water, where it's a      frequent associate of both the largemouth and smallmouth      bass. In my opinion, the pickerel-though      bony-is a superior food fish to the largemouth bass      and is the equal of the smallmouth. In fact, whereas many      anglers keep the bass they catch, and throw back the      equally sporty pickerel, I often do just the opposite! An      added advantage of stocking pickerel is that these fish      feed voraciously all year long: You can catch them during      the dog days of August <em>and</em> through a layer of ice      in the winter (times when bass are sluggish and hard to      interest in bait or lures).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Northern pike</strong> (Esox lucius): This big      cousin of the pickerel is the largest predator species      suitable for the farm pond. It's not generally recommended      for such small bodies of water, but some freshwater      aquaculturists in the northern states have had success with      pike, and it's a standard choice of pond fish cuiturists in      Europe. Keep in mind, though, that to sustain reproduction      of pike, the pond <em>must</em> have a marshy area that can      be flooded in the early spring.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Walleye</strong> (Stiaostedion vitreum): Few      freshwater fishes can rival the flavor of the walleye.      However, this species will thrive only in <em>larger</em>      ponds . . . and unless the body of water has a sizable      stream flowing into it or an upwelling of water through the      bottom, reproduction by the walleye is out of the question.      Other factors include the walleye's requirement for cool      water and its voracious appetite for fish (more than can be      provided by bluegills alone, so you'll also need to stock a      forage species).    </p>    <p>      <strong>PANFISH</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sunfish:</strong> Surprisingly few fishes other      than the sunfishes and their relatives show promise for      filling the bluegill's niche in the traditional farm pond      community. The redear sunfish <em>(Lepomis      microlophus)</em> is a giant among the sunfishes, growing      faster and reaching larger sizes than the bluegill. Unlike      the rest of its kin, the redear does not tend to become      overpopulated in pond environments. On the one hand, this      low reproductive capacity is an advantage . . . but it also      means that this species doesn't provide adequate forage for      bass. Many anglers fault the redear for not feeding at the      surface, too, since that limits the methods by which it can      be caught. For these reasons, the redear is usually stocked      together with the bluegill.    </p>    <p>      The well-known pumpkinseed sunfish <em>(Lepomis      gibbosus)</em> is generally much smaller than the bluegill,      but in its natural pond environment this species may attain      the excellent pan size of eight'or nine inches . . .and the      pumpkinseed will tolerate cooler water temperatures than      will either the redear or the bluegill. Some folks even      stock the pumpkinseed solely for its incomparable beauty.      This species <em>is</em> quite prone to stunting, though.    </p>    <p>      Apart from the bluegill, redear, and pumpkinseed sunfishes,      none of the naturals-train <em>Lepomis</em> species are      suitable for farm pond fish culture. However, some of the      <em>hybrid</em> sunfishes do show promise for homestead      aquaculture. Most attention to date has been focused on the      so-called hybrid bluegill, produced by crossing a female      bluegill with a male green sunfish. The hybrids grow much      faster than either parent species and are virtually      sterile, thus eliminating the problem of overpopulation.      This also means, of course, that "seed" has to be purchased      annually . . . and although the fish are now available      commercially, stocking them can prove quite costly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Crappie:</strong> The black crappie <em>(Pomoxis      nigromaculatus)</em> and the white crappie ( <em>P.</em>      <em>annularis)</em> belong to the family      <em>Centrarchidae,</em> along with the basses and the      sunfishes. The crappies actually occupy a niche      <em>between</em> the basses and the sunfishes: That is,      they prey on small fish (which the sunfishes. rarely do),      but since they lack the basses' cavernous mouths, crappies      are limited as to the size of their quarry. As a general      rule, crappies either die out or become stunted in farm      ponds.    </p>    <p>      The conventional wisdom is that it takes a "large" pond      (this could be anywhere from 3 to 100 acres!) to produce      good crappie harvests. The fish has been managed in some      small ponds, though, with the key to success being a      variable water level (one that's high in the winter and low      in the summer). Unfortunately, most ponds aren't set up to      permit this sort of manipulation . . . and there's also a      trade-off involved, as this degree of fluctuation in the      water level is detrimental to sunfish. Other factors that      favor the crappies are the presence of forage fish, streams      entering the pond, and heavy continuous harvesting. One      distinct advantage of the white crappie, however, is its      tolerance of turbidity . . . so if you find it impossible      to keep your water clear enough for good bass and bluegill      fishing, this species may be worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rock bass <em>(Ambloplites      rupestris):</em></strong> As its name suggests, the rock      bass prefers a stony bottom . .. it won't thrive when      raised over a bed of mud. Like the crappies, the rock bass      occupies a niche between the sunfishes and the larger      basses. In its <em>natural</em> habitat, this species is a      frequent associate of the smallmouth bass, but the pairing      is best avoided in farm pond fish culture. Rock bass are      easy to catch and do well in cool-water ponds . . . but on      all other counts the smallmouth bass is the superior      candidate. My guess is that every pound of rock bass      produced means one pound less of potential smallmouth bass.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bullheads:</strong> In my opinion, the flavor of      these small catfish is unsurpassed among the North American      freshwater fishes. As bottom feeders, bullheads aren't      serious competitors of any of the other farm pond fish      mentioned above . . . but in a small, shallow body of      water, a dense population of bullheads - with their      constant rooting - will cause considerable turbidity,      to the detriment of other species. And as with most of the      smaller farm pond fishes, bullheads must be heavily      harvested to prevent stunting. It's even more difficult to      control a bullhead population by angling than it is to keep      up with a bluegill or crappie population, but -      unlike the centrarchid fishes - bullheads are easy to      catch in traps.    </p>    <p>      Of this fish's several species, the brown bullhead      <em>(Ictalurus nebulosus)</em> is the best for farm pond      culture. A promising stocking system involves the      substitution of the brown bullhead for the bluegill, with      the channel catfish playing the role of the largemouth      bass.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FORAGE FISH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Some species commonly raised as bait "minnows" may be      stocked in the farm pond as forage for predator fish. This      practice should not be confused with actual bait fish      culture, however: It's simply not possible to produce a lot      of bait minnows in a pond stocked with predatory fish!    </p>    <p>      The main benefit of stocking forage fish is that by doing      so you can produce large predators in less time than would      be required if panfish were the only available food source.      The trade-off is that, since most predators will prefer a      soft-bodied, streamlined minnow to a dish-shaped, spiny      mouthful (such as a bluegill), stocking forage fish      increases the danger of stunting your bluegills. Most      forage fish are also to some degree competitive with the      panfish for food.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Popular bait fishes:</strong> Two readily available      bait fish that are well adapted for use as forage fish are      the golden shiner <em>(Notemigonus crysoleucas)</em> and      the fathead minnow or "tufy" <em>(Pimephales      promelas).</em> The latter species rarely exceeds four      inches in length, and while the golden shiner will      occasionally reach as much as ten inches, it isn't worth      catching for eating.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gizzard shad</strong> <strong><em>(Dorosoma      cepedianum):</em></strong> This small, herringlike fish      will thrive in farm ponds and, because it's a phytoplankton      feeder, will profit from fertile, slightly "green" water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mosquito fish <em>(Gambusia affinis):</em></strong>      This tiny fish (its maximum length is two inches) makes      good forage, and - as its name implies - it's      also useful in controlling mosquitoes. This species is best      able to sustain its population in ponds in which channel      catfish are the principal predators, most likely because      mosquito fish like to occupy the tiny spaces in weeds and      brush where the catfish seldom venture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Suckers:</strong> The family <em>Catostomidae</em>      may be the "sleeper" among the North American farm pond      fishes. As far back as 1966, the lake chubsucker-      <em>Erimyzon sucetta</em> - was recommended as forage      for bass (it's also one of the few fishes that will control      filamentous algae) . . . and the black-tail red-horse      <em>(Moxostoma poecilurum)</em> has been shown to improve      the production of channel catfish. Both of these species      attain sizes large enough to qualify them as panfish, so      they can be considered as substitutes for the bluegill, as      well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FARM POND UNSUITABLES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although this article can cover only a smattering of the      fish that might be raised in the farm pond, you can assume      that those species not mentioned here simply have not been      thoroughly tested and thus-at this time-aren't      recommended. In addition, the eight fish listed      below-while attractive for some aquaculture      purposes-are <em>not</em> suitable for generalfarm      pond use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Trout:</strong> The ever-popular trout is a      deservedly favorite food and sport fish, but it is a      <em>cold-water fish</em> and thus is out of place in the      warm-water environment of the farm pond.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Carp:</strong> The common carp <em>(Cyprinus</em>      <em>carpio</em> ) is one of the best fishes for      <em>intensive</em> culture, but it's ill-suited for the      small, extensive system of the farm pond. Because this      species obtains most of its food from the pond bottom, the      piglike rooting behavior of the large carp will cause      undesirable turbidity in small bodies of water stocked with      visual feeders such as bass and bluegills.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Goldfish</strong> <strong><em>(Carassius      auratus):</em></strong> Although some homestead      aquaculturists stock goldfish for their beauty and their      use as forage fish, this species-like the      carp-causes turbidity in the water and is therefore      not recommended.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Yellow perch <em>(Perca flavescens):</em></strong>      The yellow perch is among the tastier of the freshwater      species, but it's not advisable for use in farm ponds, as      it's prone to stunting and preys heavily upon bass spawn.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Green sunfish (Lepomis cyaneltus):</strong> This      fish is atypical among the <em>Lepomis</em> species in that      it has a gaping mouth like the basses . . . and this is a      tip-off to its feeding behavior. A mediocre food fish that      competes with the larger predators, the green sunfish      should be avoided in farm pond fish culture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grass carp:</strong> The Asian grass carp      <em>(Ctenopharyngodon</em> idellus)-also called the      "white amur"-has long been touted as an ideal fish      for aquaculture, but it has little appeal for the farm pond      owner. As a voracious herbivorous fish, this species      <em>could</em> be useful for one-time stocking in      weed-choked ponds . . . but a body of water with enough      plants to maintain a sizable grass carp population would be      useless for hook-and-line fishing (conversely, in a      properly managed, largely weed-free pond, grass carp would      need to be heavily fed). This species won't reproduce in      the farm pond, either . . , and it's illegal in much of the      United States, to boot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Buffalofish:</strong> The bigmouth buffalofish      <em>(Ictiobus</em> cyprinellus) is sometimes cultured as a      food fish, but this species has no place in the farm pond,      since it's a filter feeder and practically impossible to      harvest by hook and line.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tilapia:</strong> This fish is almost as hard to      catch on hook and line as the buffalofish. In addition,      tilapia will survive the winter outdoors only in the      southernmost region of the U.S.... and in that part of the      country, the importation of the potentially fastspreading      fish is justifiably illegal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOURCES OF FISH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Whatever you do, don't stock your farm pond with small fish      taken from the natural environment. You should even be      suspicious of a neighbor's pond, unless you know for      certain that he or she has stocked and managed the pond      with care. Identification of tiny fish is difficult, and      it's just not possible to examine each individual. It's all      too easy to err and slip a few green sunfish in with those      bluegills, or to scoop up some baby carp with those      chubsuckers from the creek.    </p>    <p>      If you're interested in stocking the <em>conventional</em>      farm pond fishes (largemouth bass, bluegill, redear      sunfish, channel catfish, and some of the forage fishes),      you may be able to get them free of charge through your      local SCS office. And to find out where to <em>buy</em>      fish stock, try the <em>1984 Buyer's Guide</em> (it's      available for $8.00 postpaid from <em>Aquaculture Magazine,      Dept</em> . TMEN, P.O. Box 2329, Asheville, North Carolina      28802) . . . or write the U.S. Department of Fish      Hatcheries, Dept. TMEN, Washington, D.C. 20240 and ask for      its free lists of suppliers (given by state).    </p>    <p>      <strong>STOCKING SYSTEMS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The accompanying table lists several farm pond stocking      systems that have proved effective. Obviously, this      sampling-which includes both conservative and      innovative setups-is intended only to suggest the      range of possibilities and to supplement information      available from your local SCS and/or fisheries extension      agents. These folks' recommendations, though somewhat      conservative, will provide a sound basis for your      fish-stocking endeavors. Keep in mind, too, that each pond      is unique and that even two neighboring bodies of water may      differ greatly as to their biological and chemical makeup.      (Stocking systems and other farm pond culture techniques      are dealt with in more detail in my book <em>The Freshwater      Aquaculture Book: A Manual for Small Scale Aquaculture</em>      <em>in</em> <em>North America,</em> which will be published      by Cloudburst Press later this year.)    </p>    <p>         <strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong> . . .    </p>    <p>      A good magazine for the serious farm pond fish culturist is      <em>Farm Pond Harvest</em> (subscriptions are $8.00 per      year from Professional Sportsmen's Publishing Company,      Dept. TMEN, RR 2, Momence, Illinois 60954). Other sources      of farm pond facts are the booklets on the topic that are      put out by various state agencies. These manuals are      usually free to state residents and are sold at a nominal      cost to nonresidents. All of the state booklets that I've      seen contain worthwhile information, but I'm particularly      fond of "Producing Fish and Wildlife from Kansas Ponds"      (available from the Kansas Fish and Game Commission, Dept.      TMEN, RR 2, Box 54-A, Pratt, Kansas 67125 . . . it's free      of charge to residents and can be had for $2.50 postpaid if      you're a nonresident). This 56-page manual examines      <em>all</em> the uses of the farm pond and offers a number      of stocking options.    </p>    <p>      Each of the references mentioned here offers a slightly      different viewpoint on the specifics of homestead fish      culture, of course, but they all share the recognition that      the farm pond was originally conceived as a multipurpose      facility . . . and, as such, its use is subject not only to      the laws of biology but to human whimsy as well. The      possibilities offered by farm pond fish culture are only      just now beginning to be perceived. These publications are      ushering us out of a slightly stodgy era of conservative      farm pond practices and into a period of innovation.
