        <p>Undoubtedly, most of you have - at one time or another - heard the Boy Scout motto, "Be prepared!" Well, in my 13-year involvement with Scouting, I've found that a big part of being prepared is knowing how to "do more with less" (another phrase that is certainly familiar to MOTHER-readers). And since I've put a good bit of MOTHER's wisdom to use in my BSA program over the years, I'd like to help even things up by sharing a Scouting idea with MOM's readers. It's a special adaptation of the old tin-can lantern, and - though it's nothing fancy - it's darned handy to have around the old homestead when the electricity goes off . . . and it's a great addition to any lowbudget camper's or backpacker's outfit.</p><p>Here's how to put together the no-cost little gadget:</p><p>Scrounge up a No. 10 tin can or a twopound coffee can . . . a wire coat hanger . . . an inch-long nail . . . a few inches of fine wire of some sort (copper is excellent for this) . . . a stick or narrow piece of wood about six inches long . . . and a candle stub or one of those short, fat kitchen candles. That's your total bill of materials!</p><p>Now, start work by straightening out the coat hanger, snipping off both curly ends, and cutting the wire in half. Lay the two pieces aside for a moment and direct your attention to the can. With the lid off the tin, turn the can on its side . . . so that what was the top is now the "front" of the soon-to-be lantern. Next, punch eight holes in the can. The bottom holes should be about twice as far apart as are those in the top. (See the accompanying illustration.)</p><p>With that done, go back to your two sections of coat-hanger wire and bend each one in the middle to form a "U". Insert the ends of the wires through the holes in the can-down through the top-so that the tips protrude from the bottom. Let about half an inch of each of the ends poke out, then bend them outward slightly . . . to form "legs" for the lantern and to hold the wires permanently in place. To make a carrying handle, use the copper wire to bind your stick of wood to the undersides of the two coathanger loops extending above the top of the can.</p><p>Your final chore is to drive that inch-long nail through the center of the tin's bottom, leaving the nail sticking up as a spike upon which to impale the candle. It's not a bad idea to <em>lock</em> the nail in its hole by dropping a dab of epoxy glue onto its head.</p><p><strong>LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE</strong></p><p>This make-do device can be safely set on a table or other flat surface or be carried by its wooden handle. You can also use it to light a tent or similar shelter by suspending the lantern in front of your abode's door. [ <em>EDI</em>Â <em>TOR'S NOTE: It's best not to use any open flame</em> inside a <em>tent</em>.] The shiny back (ex-bottom) of the can will serve admirably as a reflector, while the mouth of the lantern will act as a sort of barrel that allows you to aim the illumination. And if you keep its back pointed into the wind, this little light will shine even in a storm.</p>
