        The construction of an average home (2,000 square feet) usuallyresults in 8,000 pounds of construction waste. Add that to thewaste generated by demolition, and the figures are astounding:Every year in the United States, 136 million tons of constructionand demolition waste are tossed into landfills. This debris amountsto more than half of all landfill waste ? and much of it can bereused if handled properly. Here are several ways you can locatereclaimed and recycled construction materials:<br /><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><b>The Internet.</b>'<a href="http://www.freecycle.org" target="_blank">Freecycling</a>' is aneasy-to-use Internet service for people who want to trade thingslocally, for free.
