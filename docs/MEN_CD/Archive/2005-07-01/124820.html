        Agricultural biotechnology giant Monsanto is buying Seminis, theworld's largest producer of fruit and vegetable seeds. Theacquisition makes Monsanto the largest supplier of vegetable seeds.Before the sale, Monsanto already controlled 91 percent of theglobal genetically modified (GM) seed market, focusing on corn,soybeans and cotton.<br /><br />In 2004, farmers successfully opposed Monsanto's GM wheat intiativefor fear that it would hurt exports and contaminate seed stocks.The company's chief executive, Hugh Grant, downplayed the purchaseof Seminis as a part of Monsanto's effort to expand GM crops.However, some organic farming advocates fear the company may pushfor GM vegetables and fruits while the Food and DrugAdministration's GM regulations are still lax. Under current rules,Monsanto can market new GM crops without notifying the agency,unless the product contains a known allergen or its nutrient valueis significantly altered.<br /><br />Go to <a href="http://www.thecampaign.org" target="_blank">The Campaign</a> formore information about Monsanto's genetic-engineering historyworldwide.
