                <p>      A wild foods expert reports on a nutritious treat that's      better tasting-and much better for you-than      chocolate.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Christopher Nyerges    </h5>        <p>      What do you do if you have an incurable sweet tooth, but      you <em>don't want</em> to pollute your body with the      sugary, cocoa-flavored candies, cakes, etc. that it craves?      Well, "chocaholics", you can now take heart, because      whenever your taste buds demand something sweet, feed them      carob instead . . . it's a pure, unrefined food that can be      easily substituted for chocolate <em>(and for</em> other      processed sweets, as well).    </p>    <p>      If you've ever shopped in a natural foods store, you're      probably already familiar with carob, which appears on the      shelves in powder form and as an ingredient of candies and      baked confections. Actually, the little bean pods have even      more possibilities than you may realize . . . not only can      they provide a tasty stand-in for chocolate and cocoa, but      they're also a very nutritious food.    </p>    <p>      Carob is rich in protein, A and B vitamins, and such      essential minerals as phosphorus and calcium. It's also      much lower in fat and-especially because it's      naturally sweet-in calories than chocolate or      chocolate products. Furthermore, carob is nonallergenic . .      . and doesn't contain theobromine, a stimulant which is      present in chocolate.    </p>        <p>      <strong>IT GROWS ON TREES!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although most folks think of carob as a flour, it's not      derived from grain. The sweet is actually a powder, which      is finely ground from the pods of the carob tree. Native to      the Mediterranean region, Ceratonia siliqua also grows in      the hot, arid climate of Arizona and southern California .      . . where it often reaches a height of 50 feet. Spreading      from a short, thick trunk, the evergreen produces a dense      crown of glossy, dark leaves. Its numerous fruits-in      the form of long, flat pods-each contains 10 to 16      small brown seeds in a sweet pulp. The leathery,      strong-smelling seed cases can be gathered right from the      tree (when they're ripe) and eaten raw . . . or ground into      carob powder for use in baking.    </p>    <p>      The carob tree (it's sometimes called St. John's bread,      locust bean, or honey locust . . . but don't confuse it      with the true honey locust, <em>Gleditsia triacanthos)</em>      has played a major role in man's diet since Biblical times.      The pods of the hardy plant often nourished people during      periods of starvation or warfare . . . and carob was widely      used as a sweetener-because of its natural      sugars-before the introduction of refined sucrose.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EAT 'EM "IN THE RAW"</strong>    </p>    <p>      Nowadays-although the use of processed carob powder      for baking purposes is quite common-most people don't      ever consider eating the raw pods. In fact, whenever I      offer them to participants in my wild foods classes and      workshops, the unanimous reaction is one of disbelief . . .      and-often-distaste. A manufacturer of      commercial carob powder even told me that-even though      he considered them suitable for livestock feed-the      pods required, in his opinion, complicated preparations in      order to make them edible for humans!    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, I recently attended a wild foods dinner      where the host served us a simple, delicious dessert:      bite-sized pieces of broken Ceratonia husks, which we ate      raw.    </p>    <p>      When you go foraging for carob pods, be careful not to      choose green (immature) or moldy (overripe) specimens.      Collect only the firm, lavender-brown seed      cases-which ripen from late summer through early      fall, but can be found year round-and dust off each      one before you bite into it. As you chew, simply spit out      the tiny, hard seeds which are inside the pods. You'll find      that the leathery fruits are wonderfully sweet ...      <em>and</em> they're easy to pack along, making carob pods      an excellent snack food for hikers and cyclists.    </p>        <p>      <strong>POD INTO POWDER</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're lucky enough to lay in a large store of the      crunchy husks, you might like to grind your own carob      powder as a low-cost alternative to the store-bought      variety. To do this, you'll first need to remove the seeds.      Wash the pods carefully and then steam them in a pressure      cooker-at 15 pounds of pressure-for      approximately 20 minutes. When the husks have cooled and      dried off, they'll split open easily to release the seeds.      (Don't discard those inedible nuggets, though . . . they      can be softened in boiling water and used to make an      attractive, natural necklace.) Finally, divide the seedless      husks into small sections and process the pieces in a      blender until they're ground into a fine, dark meal.    </p>    <p>      You can also make carob powder by using a rough stone      mortar and pestle like those shown in the accompanying      photo. Before you start, just crack open each pod (you'll      probably have to use a pair of pliers to do so) and remove      the seeds. Once the husks are empty, dry them over hot      coals . . . or leave them in an oven, on the      <em>lowest</em> heat setting, overnight. Then grind the      cured pods thoroughly . . . and you'll produce a      chocolate-flavored flour that's great when added to cakes,      breads, and pancakes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAROB IN THE KITCHEN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Whether you grind it yourself or buy the commercially      prepared mixture, you can substitute carob powder for      chocolate and cocoa in just about <em>any</em> recipe.      Simply use the same amount of carob as you would of cocoa,      or-in a chocolate-based recipe-use three      tablespoons of carob for each square of chocolate.    </p>    <p>      The "locust tree" fruit can even be used in place of sugar      in all bread products (although it does give such foods a      dark brown color). Carob is also an excellent flavoring to      add to milkshakes, to baked beans . . . and even to      barbecue sauces!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>A "HONEY" OF A DESSERT</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      For your initial foray into the world of cooking with      carob, try this delicious cake . . . it's a luscious torte      that's almost guaranteed to convert you to the growing      ranks of carob fans    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 250Â°F and-while it's      warming-beat together 1/2 cup of fresh, lightly      salted butter . . . 1/2 cup of raw (preferably wild) honey      . . . and 1/2 cup of unsulfured blackstrap molasses. When      these ingredients are well blended, fold in one egg and      stir the mixture well.    </p>    <p>      In a separate bowl, sift together 2 cups of stone-ground      whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup of carob powder, 1/2 teaspoon      of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/8 teaspoon of      sea salt.    </p>    <p>      Then-using a <em>total</em> of 3/4 cup of hot      water-alternately add the liquid and the dry      ingredients to the butter/honey/molasses base. Finally,      stir in one cup of chopped walnuts, and beat (with a wooden      spoon) clockwise-"with feeling"-until the      batter comes alive and gets almost fluffy.    </p>    <p>      Pour the cake mixture into a lightly greased 9" X 9" pan      (or use a double recipe and round 9"-diameter pans to make      a layer cake, like the one shown in the photo, if you      prefer) and bake it for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, until the dark      dessert is moist and has shrunk away from the sides of the      container.    </p>    <p>      I like to serve the tasty cake with a frosting that's      <em>also</em> flavored with carob, and will delight      honey-lovers with its naturally sweet taste. To make the      topping, cream 2 tablespoons of raw butter and 2/3 cup of      powdered milk together with 1/3 cup of carob powder. Add      1/4 cup of honey, 4 tablespoons of raw cream, and 1      teaspoon of vanilla . . . then beat until the icing has a      smooth, creamy texture. (You might want to double the      recipe, to cover a layer cake, or just so you'll have      plenty of frosting for the treat . . . even <em>after</em>      the spoon-lickers and samplers have had their fill! )    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>OH, FUDGE!</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Another rich-and tempting-dessert that can be      made from carob is fudge . . . and the basic recipe      requires nothing more than equal quantities of peanut      butter, honey, and carob powder.    </p>    <p>      Melt 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of honey-in      a small saucepan-over low heat, until the mix is soft      and gooey. Then remove it from the stove and slowly stir in      1/2 cup of carob powder.    </p>    <p>      Mold the mixture into small balls, and roll each one in      whole sesame seeds or flaked coconut. As a variation (or if      you'd prefer to make some traditional fudge squares), you      can blend about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts or seeds into the      melted batter . . . spread it in the bottom of a long pan .      . . chill it . . . and cut the hardened dessert into      squares.    </p>    <p>      Whether it's used in treats like the ones described in this      article or in breads or other "everyday" cooking, carob      always produces a superior natural flavor . . . a taste      you'll want to try again! But even if you just chew on the      raw pods of the <em>Ceratonia</em> tree, I'm sure you'll      agree that carob isn't merely another overrated "wonder      food". It's a nourishing and tasty way to satisfy your      sweet tooth. . . <em>without</em> suffering the negative      effects of refined sugar.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to grind your own carob powder      but don't have access to one of the husk-bearing trees, o      you can order raw pods from The Surviv al Shop, Dept. TMEN,      P.O. Box 42216, Los Angeles, California 90042. The dark      brown fruits sell for $2.00 per pound . . . or $8.50 for a      five-pound order.    </p>
