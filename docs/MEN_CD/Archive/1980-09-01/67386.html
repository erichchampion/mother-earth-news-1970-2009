                        <p>      Lately, more and more people have begun to understand just      how limited-in both variety and nutritional      value-our "modern" diets hove become. This      realization has sparked a new and widespread interest in      the culinary and therapeutic uses of herbs . . . those      plants which a lthough not well-known today-were,      just one short generation ago, honored "guests" on the      dinner tables and in the medicine chests of our      grandparents' homes. In this regular feature, MOTHER      examines the availability, cultivation, and benefits of our      "forgotten" veget able foods and rem edies . . .      and-we hope-helps pre vent the loss of still      another bit of an cestral lore.    </p>    <p>      Mullein (Verbascum thapsus) may be known to you by one or      more of its 30 common names. (Among them are velvet dock,      Aaron's rod, Adam's flannel, Jacob's staff, blanket leaf,      cow's lungwort, candlewick, feltwort, hare's beard, and      flannel flower.)    </p>    <p>      This Mediterranean native-which can be found in      fields, in pastures, and along roadsides all across the      U.S.-was well-known to the early Greeks, who made      lamp wicks from its dried leaves . . . and to the ancient      Romans, who dipped its dried stalk in tallow to produce      funeral torches. Pliny noted that "figs do not putrefy at      all that are wrapped in mullein leaves", and Roman ladies      reportedly used an infusion of the herb's flowers to add a      golden tinge to their tresses.    </p>        <p>      (If you'd like to try such a hair rinse, boil just 3 to 4      tablespoons of dried mullein blossoms in a pint of water      for 20 to 30 minutes, and strain the blooms out when the      mixture is cool. After shampooing, pour or brush the rinse      through your hair repeatedly until the desired shade is      reached.)    </p>    <p>      Though officially known as a weed, this prolific biennial      is the herb of St. Fiacre-the Irish patron saint of      horticulturists-and is a handsome garden or landscape      addition. The plant-stout, erect, and growing up to      seven feet tall-has large, pale green, spear-shaped      leaves covered with a yellowish white velvety matting. Its      straight stem is topped by a long, dense spike of yellow      sessile flowers-with orange stamensthat bloom from June to      September. The blossoms have a faint, pleasant scent that's      attractive to bees.    </p>    <p>      Mullein propagation is usually done from seed, though you      can transplant foraged root stock or seedlings (18 to 24      inches apart) in your garden. If you're unable to find wild      mullein, the following firms carry the seeds: Otto Richter      & Sons, Ltd., Dept. TMEN, Goodwood, Ontario, Canada L0C      1A0 (packet 75 cents, catalog 7511) . . . Casa Yerba, Dept.      TMEN, Star Route 2, Box 21, Day's Creek, Oregon 97429      (packet 50 cents, catalog $1.00) . . . Borchelt Herb      Gardens, Dept. TMEN, 474 Carriage Shop Road, East Falmouth,      Massachusetts 02536 (packet 60  cents , catalog SASE).    </p>        <p>      During its first year, the young plant will produce only a      rosette of downy leaves, followed-the second      summer-by the long flowering stalk. (Young rosettes      make beautiful bases for larger flower arrangements.)      Mullein prefers chalky soil and a sunny position, but will      flourish almost anywhere. However, because of its height,      the herb should be either staked or sheltered from the      wind. Once established, it'll perpetuate itself by      self-sowing.    </p>    <p>      Although not useful as a food, mullein (which is reportedly      an antispasmodic, diuretic, expectorant, demulcent,      astringent, sedative, and a nonnarcotic pain killer) has,      throughout history, been used in many medicinal      applications. Its dried leaves have been smoked, burned as      incense, and used in steam vapor to relieve lung      congestion. A fresh leaf, when wrapped around a bleeding      finger, makes a fine emergency bandage, and-in      Appalachia-colds are commonly treated with mullein      tea.    </p>    <p>      The flowers, if steeped in olive oil for about three weeks,      produce an ointment that has been used to treat frostbite,      chapped skin, hemorrhoids, and earache . . . and is said to      remove rough warts if applied as a poultice.    </p>    <p>      The plant's foliage can also serve as blotters, toilet      paper, containers for vegetables when cooking in a fire      pit, and "gloves" when gathering such thorny herbs as      stinging nettles. In pioneer days girls in the Midwest      rubbed their faces with mullein "fur" to bring a rosy flush      to their cheeks, and-even today-children find      that the big leaves make excellent blankets for doll beds!    </p>
