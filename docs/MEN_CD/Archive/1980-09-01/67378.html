    <p>
                <p>      Here's the lowdown on an exotic Oriental one-legged edible!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Joseph Alper    </h5>        <p>      In ancient China and Japan, the savory <em>shiitake</em>      (it's pronounced "she-tar-kee") mushroom was reserved for      royalty, and its deep forest habitats-where the fungi      grew wild on the logs of <em>shii</em> trees and other      hardwoods-were closely guarded. Then, some thousand      years ago, Japanese farmers began to <em>cultivate</em> the      firm, slightly chewy morsels, and today the island nation      exports more than three million pounds of dried mushrooms a      year . . . to countries all over the world.    </p>    <p>      These gourmet treats (which are much more flavorful than      the commonly available white button mushrooms) are an      excellent source of high-quality protein, fiber, vitamin C,      the B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and trace      elements . . . and contain even fewer calories than do      apples. Furthermore, clinical tests have demonstrated the      shiitake's ability to reduce serum cholesterol in humans by      10-20%, and-when fed to laboratory animals-the      fungi have seemed to help prevent polio and influenza      infections.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOOD FOR ALL</strong>    </p>    <p>      B esides being a dinnertime treat <em>and</em> a marketable      crop (the food co-ops here in Madison, Wisconsin are eager      to buy all I can produce, at about $2.00 a pound), the      shiitake <em>(Lentinus edodes)</em> can provide food for      your animals. No, the critters don't eat the      <em>mushrooms</em> (which are far too tasty to be used as      livestock feed) . . . but they'll love the straw, bark, and      paper compost that remains after the harvest. These fungi,      you see, are lignicolous: that is, they break down the      lignin that makes such wastes unsuitable for animal      rations, and-at the same time-release vitamins,      carbohydrates, cellulose, and sugars . . . as well as a      slightly sweet aroma. (In palatability tests, cows and pigs      chose mushroom compost over conventional feeds every time!)    </p>    <p>      Though the mushrooms should ideally be eaten within two      days after they're picked, they do keep longer than the      common white variety and are easily dried whole .. . in a      140°F oven or-better yet-outdoors on a hot      day. To reconstitute them, simply soak the fungi for 20 to      30 minutes in cool water . . . or for 15 minutes in      <em>hot</em> water. They won't swell up very much, but will      become quite pliable.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SHIITAKE CULTIVATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      The best "culture" on which to grow the shiitake contains      straw, corncobs, 10% oak bark (an important ingredient),      and up to 50% paper. Oat hulls, sawdust, and other similar      farm wastes can also be employed, but-whatever you      use-be sure to grind the material up well.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you'll <em>also</em> need mushroom seed (or      spawn, as it's properly called). :This can be obtained from      The Kinoko Company (Dept. TMEN, 8139 Capwell Drive,      Oakland, California 94621) at $9.95, postpaid, for 500      grams. (Write ,and ask for a catalog.) Use about one ounce      (28 grams) of spawn per pound of dry waste. If you purchase      already seeded wood chips, simply allow five to ten chips      for each standard compost container, described below. (Or      experiment by ordering a ready-to-sprout "Shiitake Mushroom      Log" for $21.95 postpaid from The Lovin' Spoonful, Dept.      TMEN, 28 Durham Drive, Dix Hills, New York 11746.)    </p>    <p>      To construct your "tray", make a frame from softwood 1 X      6's (mine is 2' X 3'), being sure to use waterproof glue.      Staple a screen of wire mesh (with 1" to 2" holes) to one      side of the frame, and then affix 12 storm window clips to      hold another (removable) piece of wire screen to the back.      For convenience, a metal handle can be fastened to the top      (one of the shorter sides).    </p>    <p>      Now, pack the tray well with the compost mixture and pour      boiling water-about a gallon for every pound of dry      material-over the waste. (This should be done in an      old tub so that the straw can soak up the water.)    </p>    <p>      An alternative method is to heat a large drum of water to      boiling and "dunk" the entire loaded tray. (This technique      is preferable when more than one container is being      "pasteurized".) After several minutes remove the tray from      the water, allow it to drain, and cover it with a      <em>clean</em> polyethylene bag (plastic trash bags work      fine).    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANT YOUR CROP</strong>    </p>    <p>      The mixture should then be allowed to cool to 85°F, a      process which can take from one to three days. At that      point, uncover the tray . . . remove the wire backing . . .      and-with <em>clean</em> hands-mix in the spawn.      (If seed-inoculated wood chips are used, simply push them      into the mixture without removing the screen.) Recover the      container with the plastic bag, seal the wrap well, and      allow the cage to sit in a dark place.    </p>    <p>      After about one week, the shiitake must be exposed to light      for five days. (Sunlight or fluorescent light is fine, but      grow-lights won't work at all.) Unless clear plastic bags      are used, you'll have to uncover the container . . . and      administer a daily misting to make sure the compost is kept      moist.    </p>    <p>      When the exposure time is up, return the tray to the      plastic <em>bag-and to</em> its dark      confines-for six to seven more weeks . . . which is      the amount of time necessary for the mushroom seed to      spread throughout the compost. This "spawn run" will be      finished once a white growth (called mycelium) covers the      outer surfaces of the culture.    </p>    <p>      At that point, uncover the container . . . turn on the      lights . . . and wait for the fruiting bodies (the part of      the mushroom you eat) to appear. In a week to ten days,      tiny pins will form and will soon develop into mature      edibles. The tray (or trays) must be kept moist during this      time (a hose with a mist nozzle does a nice job), but don't      overwater them. (It's also important that the area be well      vent ilated ... otherwise the mushrooms may produce long,      tough stems.)    </p>    <p>      As the one-legged edibles reach the desired stage (they'll      vary in size from half an inch to two inches across the      caps), cut each of them off at the base with a sharp knife.      After that harvest, a second crop should appear in two      weeks if the tray is kept moist. In fact, you can usually      obtain three or four crops from a single container!    </p>    <p>      Once production ceases, remove the mushroom compost and      give your livestock a gastronomical feast. Then, before      using the container again, clean it well with hot water and      a scrub brush.    </p>        <p>      ANOTHER GROWING METHOD    </p>    <p>      If you don't have critters to feed or a garden that needs      <em>compost-and if</em> you're willing to wait a year      or two for your first shiitake crop-I've found an      easier growing method . . . one that doesn't require the      use of straw cultures or cages.    </p>    <p>      First, in the fall, obtain a cord of oak logs. Then, in the      following spring, drill holes in the wood and pound about      750 spawned wood chips (per cord) into the holes. Stack the      logs in a pile, and-after about a year-the      first mushrooms will appear. This crop won't be very big,      but by the second year the logs will be covered with      delectable fungi.    </p>    <p>      Woodpile crops can be harvested in both spring and fall,      and-if the logs are kept cool and moist-you can      sometimes get a good crop through the summer, too. Your oak      stack will continue to produce for four to five years,      yielding a total of about 1,000 pounds of mushrooms. (You      needn't worry about the effects of exposure to light,      ventilation, or cold winter weather, either . . . because      the shiitake is pretty hardy.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPAWN YOUR SPAWN</strong>    </p>    <p>      To save money, you can grow your own spawn, for future use,      from the seed you buy. Just mix oak chips with water, and      process them in a pressure cooker at 15 pounds for 25      minutes. Allow the cooker to cool . . . open it . . . drain      off the excess water . . . and pour the chips into a new,      clean plastic bag. Add a bit of spawn (or a few spawned      wood chips) and seal up the sack. After a couple of months,      the chips will be covered with seed and ready to use.      (Always remember to reserve a couple of chips from each      batch to produce more.)    </p>    <p>      You'll find these mushrooms a delight to eat,      since-besides seasoning the dish in which they're      used-they retain their own unique taste. (Include      them sparingly at first, because the shiitake's flavor is      much stronger than that of its supermarket counterpart.)    </p>    <p>      "Mushrooms are the fastest-growing agribusiness in this      country," says fungus expert Gary Leatham, "but-as      people find out how good such exotics as shiitake      are-many shoppers will give up the white button      mushroom. When that happens, the small-scale farmer will      reap the benefits."    </p>

When your mushroom compost is covered with a ""spawn run"" of white mycelium, as in this close-up, it's ready to be exposed to light... The ruler will give you some idea of the size of these strong-flavored mushrooms when they're ready for eating... These clumps of mature fungi growing on mycelium-coated compost will be harvested to make room for a new crop.
