        <p>MOTHER has some great adventures in store for you on our 1981 . . .</p><p>We've all heard it said that there's nothing quite so educational as travel. Well, Mother's Tours <em>expand</em> on that truism, seeking out adventures that not only offer the usual cultural, historical, and recreational travel attractions .. . but <em>also</em> provide a chance to meet with experts in fields that we believe will be of interest <em>(and</em> of lasting value) to our readers!</p><p><strong>CHECKING OUT CHINA</strong></p><p>For example, about the time you receive this issue, 32 of MOTHER's tourists will board a Japan Airlines flight in San Francisco for the long journey to Beijing and southern China's semitropical agricultural regions. Once there, we'll study-for almost three weeks-some of the intensive farming methods used to feed that country's huge population.</p><p>This unusual tour filled up within weeks after it was announced . . . so we're now in negotiation with the Chinese government to plan <em>another such</em> trip next summer. Our second excursion will visit China's northern "grain belt" .. . and we hope to give you more details in the next issue of this publication.</p><p><strong>BRAZIL'S "LIQUID SUNSHINE"</strong></p><p>Brazil is often referred to as South America's "sleeping giant", but during the 1973 OPEC embargo that nation's government was wide awake to the country's energy situation. Because the land has almost no petroleum resources of its own, Brazil began-at that time-serious research into the possibility of switching its gasoline and diesel vehicles to renewable fuels.</p><p>The Brazilian people have since made remarkable progress, and-from January 16 to February 1, 1981-you'll have a chance to see for yourself what they've accomplished on a nationwide basis, and an opportunity to talk to some of the growers, distillers, engineers, scientists, and government officials who are helping to complete the switch from a petroleum-based to an alcohol-fuel-based economy.</p><p>Since no trip to Brazil would be complete without a look at the mysterious Amazon, our journey will begin in Manaus, an old rubber boom town located 1,000 miles up this mighty river and in the very <em>heart</em> of the great South American jungle. From there, we'll move on to Recife, an old colonial city called the "Venice of Brazil", where large alcohol fuel distilleries will be in full operation.</p><p>Our next stop will be Sao Paulo, one of the world's largest and most dynamic urban areas. While in this friendly and sophisticated metropolis, we'll drop by the Volkswagen and Ford plants for a look at their new alcoholfueled cars, and talk to Mercedes-Benz engineers about that firm's conversion of diesel engines to alcohol <em>(and</em> more recent experiments with other renewable diesel fuels). We'll also visit research centers, a small farm distillery, and a medium-sized installation that's experimenting with resources other than sugar cane for ethanol production.</p><p>We'll end our trip in colorful Rio de Janeiro. There, between sightseeing and sunbathing on the beautiful beaches, we'll learn about the projected ecological impact of the alternative fuel program ... and meet with government researchers who are involved in making experimental fuel from several kinds of exotic plants.</p><p>So while the Northern Hemisphere is in the icy grip of winter, join us on a sunny sojourn in the South American summer. The trip will cost $2,395 . . . including airfare from Miami, hotels, land costs, and breakfasts. A $100 deposit ($50 of which is refundable if you cancel) will reserve your place on a tour that <em>no one</em> else offers.</p><p><strong>SOLAR, SOLAR EVERYWHERE</strong></p><p>Israel also has to import all its oil ... but that tiny land's one great natural resource-sunshine-makes it a natural laboratory for the study of solar energy. And, because of the nation's small size, it's possible to see more solar installations there in a day than one could visit during <em>weeks</em> of travel in the United States. (Israelis, in fact, live with practical sunpower as casually as we do with television.)</p><p>For that reason, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> is joining Jordan College for our <em>second</em> solar tour of Israel (see MOTHER N0. 63, pages 70 and 184, for information about our first trip) from February 18 to March 3, 1981. The cost is only $1,545 (including airfare from New York and all land costs except lunches and dinners). A $200 deposit ($100 of which is refundable if you cancel) will reserve a place for you on a journey that provides both a chance to observe a nation totally committed to the use of solar energy, <em>and</em> a marvelous opportunity to explore its many historical sites as well.</p><p><strong>A SOLAR ODYSSEY TO ENGLAND AND FRANCE</strong></p><p>Some countries to the <em>north of</em> Israel have also found the sun to be a practical energy source. From August 23 to September 6, 1981 we'll join Jordan College on an expedition that will combine a visit to the International Solar Energy Society (ISES) conference in Brighton, England with a leisurely tour of France.</p><p>Besides visiting Paris, we'll take our solar search to a variety of sun-powered installations scattered throughout the Gallic countryside . . . into the Pyrenees . .. and, finally, to the stunning French Riviera. The trip is currently priced at $1,100, including airfare from New York and <em>all</em> land costs except for lunches and dinners . . . and we need the same deposit as for the Israe tour.</p><p><strong>A SCANDINAVIAN CRAFTS TOUR</strong></p><p>For the more artistically oriented among you, we're currently putting together a Scandinavian Crafts Tour (scheduled to run from May 5 through May 22, 1981) to Finland and Denmark. Don Wilcox, one of our group leaders, has lived and worked in Scandinavia for a decade, and-over the years-has interviewed more than 1,500 of its craftspeople and published 14 books on their work.</p><p>You'll have a chance to tour outstanding museums ... meet with craft guilds . . . visit artisans (many of them Don's personal friends) at work in their studios . . . picnic on the Finnish fortress island of Suomenlinna . . . explore some unspoiled Danish islands ... visit old Viking graveyards ... bicycle through story book villages . . . and much, much more!</p><p>If you'd like to join us for a very personal visit to these northern lands, send your deposit for $100, and-again-$50 will be refunded if you cancel. Because we'll be using comfortable, but <em>not</em> "overpackaged" accommodations, we'll be able to offer you this trip for around $1,850 . . . including airfare from New York, hotels, land costs, breakfasts, five box lunches, and four evening dinners <em>plus</em> a welcome luncheon in Helsinki <em>and</em> a farewell dinner in Finland. (We'll even throw in a free visit to a Scandinavian sauna!)</p><p><strong>A SOUTH SEAS SEMINAR</strong></p><p>We're very pleased to announce that, for our final tour of 1981, MOTHER's Ecoscience columnists, Anne and Paul Ehrlich-together with their friend and coauthor John P. Holdren, Professor of Energy and Resources at the University of California at Berkeley-have agreed to lead a once-in-a-lifetime expedition (from November 27 to December 11, 1981) to the South Pacific!</p><p>After flying from the U.S. West Coast to Tahiti, this entire "dream vacation" will be spent on the enchanted islands of Bora Bora and Raiatea. There, we'll snorkel and study reef fishes by day, and-on selected evenings-Anne, Paul, and John will conduct seminars on food, ecology, and energy.</p><p>This incredible opportunity to enjoy a South Seas paradise and-at the same time-to work with (and learn from) three of the finest scientific minds around will cost about $2,300 (including airfare, hotels, and some meals). And although this tour is more than a year away, we expect the limited number of seats to fill quickly . . . so send us your $100 deposit, and we'll return $50 if you have to cancel.</p><p>All deposits should be made by certified check or money order and sent to', Mother's Tours (P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791), or . . . you can simply write to us for additional information about the trips.</p>
