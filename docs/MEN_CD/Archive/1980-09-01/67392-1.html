        YO-YO SHAWL CONSTRUCTION Each row of yo-yo shawl is assembled horizontally... and then the lines are connected to one another with vertical hitches. To give the garment a traingle shape, the first unit of each new row is sewn to the second puff of the row above. As the rows decrease in width (by units of two), you'll finally come to the last piece of the shawl, which is a single yo-yo. This sphere is centered between the two circles of the row above it, and then stitched to each in a diagonal pattern.
