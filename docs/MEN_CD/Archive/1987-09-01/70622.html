                    		<p><strong>Please let me introduce you to a red-haired    stranger. </strong></p>		<h5 id="byline">By David Petersen</h5>        <p>      If you live in any of the lower 48 states, Canada or      Alaska, at least one of the five North American fox species      - red, gray, kit, swift or arctic - is your      neighbor. And if you reside in Colorado, Utah, Texas or New      Mexico, you have four of our continent's five smallest      canids as fellow residents - whether you know it or      not. (And you can't be blamed if you <em>don't</em> , since      foxes make it their business to see that we don't see      them.)    </p>    <p>      Of the five species, the one with the red hair      <em>-Vulpes vulpes</em> , the sly antagonist of      Aesopian fables, the trickster Reynard of French-Canadian      folklore - is far and away the most plentiful and      wide-ranging. In short, it's the fox you're most likely to      meet someday. To enrich that encounter, allow me I to      introduce you.    </p>    <p>      By the calendar on the wall, the red fox has made its home      in North America for one heck of along time. But in the      long view, the little dog is a relative newcomer. Like most      other creatures that didn't evolve here but were present      when Columbus's ship came in, <em>V. vulpes</em> hiked over      from Asia in relatively recent geologic times, crossing on      God's own drawbridge, that ephemeral ice age isthmus, the      Bering-Chukchi Platform.    </p>    <p>      It's no mere coincidence, then, that North American and      Eurasian red foxes are near-twins (the European version      runs a bit larger and evidences minor microchromosomal      variances); they haven't been separated long enough to have      evolved significant morphological differences. Matter of      fact, though the two were long categorized as separate      species simply because they inhabit different continents,      wildlife taxonomists now lump them under a shared name,      <em>V. vulpes</em> (Latin for "fox fox").    </p>    <p>      And thereupon hangs a tale.    </p>    <p>      Convinced that native American red foxes were both too few      and too plebian to provide their high-bred horses and      hounds with proper sport, aristocratic European settlers      imported, beginning in 1750, substantial numbers of Old      World reds to Virginia, Pennsylvania and New England. But      the immigrant foxes proved less aloof than their importers      and promptly mingled genes with the natives, producing      - for a while, at least - a hybrid species.      This hybridization, in turn, long confused all attempts at      drawing definitive distinctions between the North American      and European species.    </p>    <p>      Today, most authorities agree that the transplants were too      restricted in both area and number, and took place too long      ago, to have carried through genetically to the present.      Thus, while European and American red foxes are closely      related, and though a Euro-American hybrid undoubtedly did      exist a couple of centuries ago in a few northeastern      states, time has probably filtered any Old World genes from      the native pool, leaving our fox a true red, white, yellow,      gray and brown American - the hues of an adult red      fox's many-colored coat.    </p>    <p>      And occasionally, other shades as well.    </p>    <p>      On the road last spring, my wife and I had just turned into      the Jenny Lake Campground in Teton National Park -      deserted so early in the season save for a young man      sitting in the sun out front of his tent, reading Tolstoy's      <em>What Is Art</em> ? - when a large, winter-pelted      fox trotted across the campground lane just ahead of us.    </p>    <p>      Now, fox sightings are no great oddity thereabouts: Teton      is known worldwide for its fecundity of wildlife. What      surprised me was the paint job on this particular model . .      . black underfur salted over with white-tipped guard hairs      to create a distinguished-looking, grizzled-silver pelage.    </p>        <p>      "Silver fox!" I exclaimed in the excitement of the moment,      reconfirming my quick grasp of the obvious - a grasp      that frequently prompts people to look at me funny and say      things like "right."    </p>    <p>      "Right," Carolyn said, looking at me funny. "So tell me      about it."    </p>    <p>      "Well," I began, "the silver fox is, uh . . . what say we      stake out a campsite before this place fills up?"    </p>    <p>      Two weeks and a thousand miles down the road, after      sneaking an evening at the college library back home, I      finally "remembered" to explain to Carolyn about the silver      fox.    </p>    <p>      The silver fox, I explained, is nothing more than one of      three rare color variations, or phases, of the common red      fox. The second is melano, or pure black. And the third,      the "cross" fox, has the normal red-fox color mix, but is      distinguished by two wide, dark brown stripes - one      running the length of its back and another across its      shoulders - forming the cross from which cometh its      name. These variant phases occur randomly anywhere <em>V.      vulpes</em> ranges, but are more common in the north . . .      in particular on northern fox farms, where all three      variations - especially the silvers - are bred      in captivity for their valuable pelts.    </p>    <p>      Your typical red fox - no matter its color -      measures about three feet overall, including more than a      foot of luxuriant tail; stands 14 to 16 inches at the      shoulders; and weighs a mere eight or 10 pounds with 12      about tops these days. (Turn-of-the-century naturalist      Ernest Thompson Seton, in his classic <em>Lives of Game      Animals</em> , reports a record American red fox weight of      16 3/4 pounds - a male raised on a game farm -      and cites a Welsh specimen that went an astonishing 29      pounds. Near as I can determine, both records still stand.)    </p>    <p>      Although foxes don't mate for life, neither are they      particularly promiscuous. Each winter, the vixen (female)      prepares a nursery den, often enlarging a woodchuck burrow      in a sandy hillside or renovating a fox den from a previous      season. When she's set, she'll send out a scent invitation,      then choose a spouse from among the numerous dog foxes      (males) that come to call.    </p>    <p>      Once mated, a fox pair will remain together, sharing the      joys and labors of parenthood, until the following autumn.      Next season, the same vixen and dog may get together again.      Or they may not.    </p>    <p>      Seven to eight weeks after the honeymoon, the vixen will      give birth - usually in late March or early April      - to around half-a-dozen quarter-pound pups. Red fox      <em>kinder</em> resemble fuzzy lumps of charcoal at birth,      save for their white-tipped tails. (This marking is unique      among North American canids, and remains with red foxes      throughout their lives, no matter what color they become      when mature.) Born deaf and blind, the pups will remain      within the womblike protection of the den for their first      few weeks, attended constantly by Mama.    </p>    <p>      Outside, Papa plays the role of sole family breadwinner      during this critical time, hunting almost continuously to      feed himself and his nursery-bound mate-for whom he      leaves mousy little love offerings at the doorstep to the      den.    </p>    <p>      After about a month, the pups - their fur now faded      to sandy-gray to better match the earth around the den      opening - will begin surfacing from their      subterranean nursery. Early forays into the great outdoors      are brief and tentative, but will gradually lengthen to      several hours at a stretch. These first few weeks under the      sun are the most hazardous in the young foxes' lives, since      they look just like lunch to a variety of predators -      notably cats, coyotes, great horned owls and golden eagles.    </p>    <p>      About 40 days after giving birth, Mama Red begins weaning      her litter and providing them with solid food. At about 10      weeks, the pups begin evidencing adolescent curiosity and      grow hot to trot along with their parents on the nightly      hunts. By autumn - approximately six months from      their birth - the pups, though not fully grown, will      have taken on their adult coloration and be capable of      fending for themselves. Soon they'll wander away from home      to stake out turfs of their own.    </p>    <p>      That's the way a fox's youth <em>should</em> unfold. But      life is tough out there in the natural world -      survival of the fittest, you know - and more than      half of every litter of fox pups will succumb to the      elements, disease, predators or men with guns, traps and      poisoned baits before reaching maturity. For those making      it to adulthood, the average life span - if not      foreshortened by human interference - is three to      seven seasons.    </p>    <p>      Like all canids, foxes mark the boundaries of their      territories with urine, also relying on scent to broadcast      other important messages ("Whyuncha come on down to my den      sometime, big boy?"). But the primary means of red fox      communication is vocal, with a language that includes yaps,      barks, mews, whines, growls, churrs, yurrs, gurrs, squalls      and screams. Naturalist E.T. Seton, though a great admirer      of the red fox, nonetheless described the little beast's      alarm scream as "probably the most sinister, unearthly      wild-animal note that can be heard in North America."    </p>    <p>      In light of this "unearthly" quality of the fox's scream,    </p>        <p>      it seems safe to postulate that a good many of the eerie      nocturnal cries traditionally attributed to panthers by      nervous campers and countryfolk in fact originate in the      narrow throats of pint-sized canines.    </p>    <p>      To me, the most intriguing characteristic of the red fox is      the way it conducts business. Whereas wolves, coyotes and      most other dogs evolved as pack animals - group      hunters, practitioners of the cooperative chase and the      open pursuit - the fox is more akin to the cats in      its social and hunting habits.    </p>    <p>      Except during mating and pup season, the red fox prefers to      live and hunt alone. And rather than running its prey to      ground after the fashion of its larger relatives the coyote      and wolf, <em>V. vulpes</em> relies on catlike stealth,      prowling slowly and quietly along established huntways,      using its sharp senses to locate prey from a distance      without itself being noticed, then stalking close and      jumping its food by surprise - thus avoiding (or at      least minimizing) garish chase scenes.    </p>    <p>      Canadian naturalist J. David Henry has spent years      observing the hunting techniques of red foxes in northern      Saskatchewan's 1,500-square-mile Prince Albert National      Park. Writing in <em>Natural History,</em> Henry postulates      that the red fox has two good reasons for hunting alone: 1)      its primary prey are meadow mice - hardly meat enough      there to share among a whole platoon of hungry hunters; and      2) such a tiny quarry is more easily captured by a      pussyfooting loner than by a boisterous pack of brutes.    </p>    <p>      Henry's observations have shown that the red fox hunts four      distinct categories of prey and - this is the sly      part - has evolved a specialized technique for taking      each.    </p>    <p>      The smallest red fox prey are bugs, which Reynard hunts in      a cavalier fashion, sauntering along until he spots a fat      juicy beetle or whatnot, then strolling over, smacking a      paw down on the star-crossed little beastie . . . and      <em>chomp</em> .    </p>    <p>      Next up in size - and most important to the red's      day-to-day survival - are mice, voles and similar      minirodents. These the fox hunts slowly and carefully.      After detecting a mouse from a distance and stalking to      within pouncing range, the hunter crouches to compress its      springs, then uncoils in a leap calculated to land its      front paws atop the furry victual.    </p>    <p>      The third classification is an unlikely pairing: birds and      squirrels (lumped together because they're of a size and      hunted similarly). According to Henry, the red fox      considers these as "targets of opportunity," to be taken as      they come rather than hunted deliberately. Upon      fortuitously spotting a groundfeeding bird or squirrel, the      little red hunter begins an impromptu stalk, moving only      when the quarry is looking away, then charges the final      distance in a "crouched, dashing run." In most instances,      the fox will attempt to grab a bird or squirrel in its      mouth rather than risk pinning it with its paws.    </p>        <p>      Henry's final class of fox prey - and the largest      animals these smallest of the wild canids will normally      tackle - consists of rabbits and hares. When hunting      these alert quarry, the fox is rarely fortunate enough to      sneak within pouncing range undetected. More often, the      approaching canine flushes the watchful lagomorph and is      forced to pursue it in a wild, zigzag chase through the      densest brush the bunny can find. If and when the fox      closes on its prey, it will attempt to bring it to ground      by snapping at the hindermost portions. With the quarry      down, the diner anchors its dinner with its paws and      administers the <em>coup de grâce</em> by sinking its      needlelike teeth into the victim's neck or head.    </p>    <p>      Cruel?    </p>    <p>      No. Merely necessary.    </p>    <p>      We upright predators do most of our hunting these days at      the supermarket . . . bagging meat that's killed, cut,      wrapped, labeled and no longer recognizable (if you don't      think about it too hard) as a gentle creature with trusting      eyes. The fox must earn its dinner in a more honest      fashion.    </p>    <p>      Inevitably, humans and foxes will occasionally find      themselves in competition for the same piece of meat. When      prompted by hard times or tempted with easy pickings, old      Reynard can be not only an adept hen heister, but a      talented duck buster as well - as noted (albeit      philosophically) by avocational duckman E.T. Seton:    </p>    <p>      "Many a duck have they [red foxes] taken from my stock, but      I gladly forgive them. It is worth more to me to hear that      squalling night-cry under my window in the darkness than to      be the over-fed owner of many fat, stupid table ducks."    </p>    <p>      He's right to forgive the raiders, you know. It's hardly      fair, or logical, to take umbrage at a natural-born hunter      for snatching unprotected poultry; to a hungry fox, a      chicken (or duck) ain't nothin' but a bird.    </p>    <p>      For those of us who want to have it all - our      poultry, our neighborhood wildlife and our humanity -      the solution to farmyard predation is to put our fowl out      of harm's way, especially at night. Be forewarned, though,      that a mere fence, no matter its height, won't suffice:      Reynard will slick right up and over a chicken-wire      barricade like the cat of a dog he is. To guarantee the      safety of your birds, house them in secure, <em>roofed</em>      nighttime enclosures, preferably hard-sided coops.    </p>    <p>      Deep within the age-parched pages of <em>Animals of the      World</em> - an obsolete zoological text published      back in 1917 by the University Society (whoever the hell      they were) - I recently unearthed some vintage      "facts" concerning wild canids. To wit:    </p>    <p>      "The dog family is not characterized by many admirable      traits in its wild state. It is usually cunning, vicious      and treacherous, and exhibits no bravery except where there      are numbers of its own kind. It is furtive and sneaking,      looking for every unfair advantage, and, once in danger, is      an arrant coward. From the commercial side, however, the      family is entitled to respect. The pelts of both wolves and      foxes are of value, those of certain varieties of foxes      bringing high prices."    </p>    <p>      There we have it - the prejudices of the times neatly      summarized by the University Society (whoever the hell they      were).    </p>    <p>      But even back then predators had a few friends. Seton, as      we've seen, was one. Another was a lanky, bewhiskered      mountaineer name of John Muir. In 1916 - the year      before the University Society published the myopic canid      dogma quoted above - Muir penned an eloquent,      marvelously iconoclastic little essay entitled      "Anthropocentrism and Predation." Therein, the father of      the Sierra Club charged:    </p>    <p>      "The world, we are told, was made especially for man      - a presumption not supported by all the facts. A      numerous class of men are painfully astonished whenever      they find anything, living or dead, in all God's universe,      which they cannot eat or render in some way what they call      useful to themselves. They have precise dogmatic insight of      the intentions of the Creator . . . . Now, it never seems      to occur to these far-seeing teachers that Nature's object      in making animals and plants might possibly be first of all      the happiness of each one of them, not the creation of all      for the happiness of one."    </p>    <p>      Today, Muir's views on anthropocentrism      ("human-centeredness") and predation are at the heart of      the burgeoning environmental philosophy called deep ecology      - a philosophy guaranteed to peeve fundamentalists      and humanists alike, but which, to my way of thinking,      holds great promise for a better world.    </p>    <p>      Thus the tunnel-view contention that any creature not      providing direct benefit to humanity is <em>a priori</em>      useless, even evil, may finally be chased out of our      collective consciousness . . . like a fox on the run.    </p>
