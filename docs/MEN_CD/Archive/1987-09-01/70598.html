            		<p><strong> KITCHEN GARDEN</strong></p>          <h5 id="byline">      By Sara Pacher    </h5>    <p>      <strong>A vegetable of many virtues.</strong>    </p>        <p>      A pumpkin isn't always a pumpkin - sometimes it's a      squash. The huge Big Max, for example, is technically a      squash but is often a winner in pumpkin contests, while the      cushaw, resembling a crookneck, is actually a pumpkin. It's      no wonder it's hard to distinguish between pumpkins and      winter squash; varieties of both are found distributed      among four species of the <em>Cucurbita</em> genus: <em>C      maxima</em> , <em>C. pepo</em> , <em>C. moshata</em> and      <em>C. mixta</em> . Pumpkins are generally more sensitive      to frost than squash are and also to soaring summer      temperatures. Since they tolerate semi-shade, they're often      planted in the corn patch - a good way to conserve      premium garden space.    </p>    <p>      While lack of space may be the main reason gardeners bypass      the pumpkin, many growers also feel that a few      jack-o'-lanterns and pumpkin pies don't justify the effort      of raising this vegetable. What they haven't caught on to      is that the versatile pumpkin can be made into a generous      assortment of delicious soups, breads, cakes, puddings,      pickles, salads and main dishes. In addition, the      protein-rich seeds are a nutritious and tasty snack and can      be used as garnish for soups and salads. (In some parts of      the world, pumpkinseeds are considered beneficial to the      prostate and are eaten by men to increase sexual potency.)      Pumpkin flowers are also edible. They can add color to      salads or be dipped in batter and fried. (One of the      largest collections of fresh pumpkin recipes can be found      in <em>Pumpkin Happy</em> by Erik Knud-Hansen, a former      crew member of the <em>Clearwater,</em> the Hudson River      sloop dedicated to environmental causes. The booklet is      available from The Clearwater, 112 Market St.,      Poughkeepsie, NY 12601, for $3.50 postpaid, and proceeds go      to the Hudson River Sloop Restoration project.)    </p>    <p>      Like corn, tomatoes and potatoes, pumpkins are native to      America and are thought to have been cultivated in Mexico      and Central America as long as 5,000 years ago. They were a      staple of the Indians in this country for several centuries      before the Europeans arrived.    </p>    <h3>      What to Grow    </h3>    <p>      It's important to choose a pumpkin variety that will fit      the size of your garden and suit your purposes as well. If,      for example, space is limited, pick a compact bush variety,      such as Cinderella, which matures in 95 days, produces      10-inch fruits (not much bigger than summer squash) and      requires about three feet by three feet of space. Its only      drawback is that it doesn't seem to keep as well as vining      types. Spirit, a semibush type good for both cooking and      carving, requires a four- to five-foot growing circle and      yields smooth, 10- to 15-pound fruits in approximately 100      days.    </p>    <p>      For the best eating, you can't go wrong with the      fine-grained, sweet meat of Small Sugar (100 days), which      matures at six to 10 pounds and is just the right size for      pie making. The slightly bigger Sweet Spookie (90 to 105      days) is another candidate for carving and cooking.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like pumpkinseeds without the hulls, you might try      Lady Godiva (110 days). This yellowish pumpkin usually has      green stripes or markings and weighs about six pounds, but      - as the seed catalogues say - "its meat isn't      of table quality." Other varieties prized for their      hull-less seeds are Trick or Treat, Triple Treat and      Streaker, all of which take around 110 days to mature.      Triple Treat's sweet meat is excellent for pies. Though      technically squashes, both Sweetnut (a compact bush      variety) and Eat-All (with five-foot vines) produce seeds      that are small but deliciously nutty, and the flesh of both      is very tasty.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO GROW GIANT PUMPKINS    </h3>        <p>      According to the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> ,      the biggest pumpkin ever grown weighed 612 pounds and was      135 inches in girth. You may not be able to top this 1984      giant from Chelan, Washington, but any county fair worth      its salt will sport entries topping 100 pounds. Here's how      pumpkin growers achieve greatness:    </p>    <p>      First, choose a jumbo variety like Big Max or King of      Giants, and put a whole bushel of aged manure covered with      dirt in a pumpkin hill. Sow three to five seeds, and when      the seedlings have two or three leaves, remove all but the      strongest plant. Let the vine produce two or three      pumpkins, removing any flowers that appear later. Next,      pull the fuzzy tip off the end of the vine, and -      once the pumpkins reach baseball size - pick off all      but the largest one. Give the plant plenty of water      <em>every day</em> . Some gardeners even slit the vine and      insert a wick that rests in a dish kept full of milk. Just      be sure to have some help handy when it's time to cart this      behemoth from the field.    </p>    <p>      Not surprisingly, the best Halloween pumpkin is called      Jack-O'-Lantern. These 10-pounders mature in 110 days, and      their smooth skin cuts easily. But if your ambition is to      take the prize for the biggest pumpkin at the county fair      (see sidebar), plant Big Max. This blue-ribbon winner,      however, requires 120 days to mature and has a shell that      is hard to carve and pale flesh that is coarse and somewhat      stringy. Furthermore, a single one of these giant pumpkin      plants - alone and unaided - can cover an area      10 to 20 feet in diameter!    </p>    <p>      For the unusual, try the large, buff-colored, box-shaped      Large Cheese (its sweet meat keeps extremely well), the      white-skinned Little Boo or the Green Striped Cushaw, whose      long, curved neck is full of fine-tasting flesh. (This      cushaw does best in warm climates.)    </p>    <h3>      When and How to Plant    </h3>    <p>      Since many pumpkins are slow to mature, gardeners with      short growing seasons should pick a 90-day variety or start      plants indoors in April or May. For early starts, place two      seeds each in three-inch containers or peat pots. (There      are 100 pumpkinseeds to an ounce, and the seeds remain      viable for five years.) Push the blunt end of the seed into      the growing medium. When the seedlings are big enough to      handle, cull the weakest of the two. Harden off the young      plants by exposing them gradually to the outdoors before      planting them in the garden. Four to six weeks after the      last frost, transplant the seedlings without disturbing      their easily damaged roots. Seeds can also be started      earlier outdoors by simply sowing them where they are to      grow and placing upturned glass jars over them.    </p>    <p>      To sow seeds directly in the garden otherwise, wait until      mid to late spring (about the same time you'd plant beans)      when the soil has warmed to 65°F. (Cold-area gardeners      sometimes speed up the soil-warming process by covering the      pumpkin patch with black plastic.) Crops planted in early      May will mature around the end of August. If you want a      later crop, plant during the first week in June.    </p>    <p>      Pumpkins can be grown in hills by sowing four to five seeds      per mound, then thinning to two plants; or in rows, by      planting two or three seeds together, keeping only the      strongest seedling. Space pumpkins according to the      directions for the variety grown. Generally speaking, allow      10 to 12 feet between hills of vining types. Hills of bush      varieties are usually spaced at a distance of four to six      feet. Vining types planted in rows should be three to four      feet apart with eight to 12 feet between rows. Plant bush      types on two- to three-foot centers with rows set four to      six feet apart. (Bush types usually do best in rows.) When      sowing vining pumpkins in the corn patch, plant in every      third row of corn, allowing eight to 10 feet between the      vines in the row. Once the corn is harvested, knock down      the stalks to allow the pumpkins to bask in full sun.      (Pumpkin yields in the corn patch might not be as high as      they are when the vines are given a private spot of their      own, but such intercropping saves a lot of space. And space      can be critically important to a gardener.)    </p>    <p>      Another efficient way to grow pumpkins is to create a      pumpkin-vine "house" - a hideaway that children will      love. To do this, cover a five-foot-square frame with      chicken wire on three sides and the top. Plant seeds of one      of the smaller pumpkin varieties 12 inches apart in      prepared strips along two opposite sides. Water regularly      and support the maturing fruits with slings made of old      pantyhose.    </p>    <p>      When planning your garden, keep in mind that, while      pumpkins won't cross with other vining cucurbits like      cucumbers and watermelons, they will cross with some types      of gourds, squash and zucchini if planted too close to      them. Such cross-pollination won't show up in the current      harvest, but if you save your seeds, next season's crop may      contain some strange vegetables.    </p>    <p>      While considered easy to grow, pumpkins do require fertile,      well-drained, neutral soil with a pH of 6.5 to 7.      Early-maturing types thrive best in sandy and sandy-loam      earth. Pumpkins need a lot of water, though, and heavier      soils help hold this essential ingredient. The big vines      are heavy feeders as well, so plenty of well-rotted manure      should be worked into the site prior to planting. (Dig a      hole where your vine is to grow, fill it with a shovelful      of manure or compost, and sprinkle dirt on top.)    </p>    <p>      Cover the seeds to a depth of one inch, and tamp the soil      lightly. Thin the seedlings when they have two or three      leaves. If you have a problem with surface crusting, which      can prevent the seedlings from emerging, scatter a thin      layer of loose soil over the seeded area. Once their rapid      growth begins, pumpkins can compete well with weeds. Until      then, do shallow weeding to keep from damaging the      seedlings' roots, and mulch between hills and rows with      straw, hay, grass clippings or leaves.    </p>    <p>      Make sure pumpkins get a <em>lot</em> of water, and apply      it slowly so it can soak down to the feeding roots two to      three feet beneath the surface. Try, however, to avoid      wetting the foliage, since this can encourage disease.      Side-dress the crop at midseason with more well-rotted      manure or compost. Once the fruits begin to fill out, water      the plants with fish emulsion or manure tea every 10 to 14      days.    </p>    <p>      Pumpkins have both male and female flowers and must be      insect-pollinated to set fruit. If such flying friends are      in short supply, do this job yourself by using a      camel's-hair brush to transfer the pollen from the males to      the females. The latter can be recognized by the immature      fruit lurking below their petals. Another pollinating      method is to strip the petals from a male flower (which has      no embryo beneath it) and push the yellow anthers into the      female flower.    </p>    <p>      Pinch off the growing tip of the main stem to encourage      more fruit-bearing side shoots to emerge, then help these      form their own roots by heaping fertile soil over them. To      prevent long vines from wandering out of their planned      growing space - and getting into no end of trouble      - pin them to the soil with staple-shaped pieces of      soft wire. Otherwise, pinch off the fuzzy ends of      too-rampant vines. (These trimmed-off stems can be cooked      like spinach.)    </p>    <p>      When the pumpkin babies reach two or three inches in      diameter, remove all but three or four fruits on each vine,      culling those growing near the ends of the plant while      saving those nearest the base. Any small pumpkins that form      too late to mature before the first heavy frost should also      be picked off - as painful as the process may be.    </p>    <h3>      What to Watch For    </h3>    <p>      With the exception of scab, a fungus that mainly attacks      cucumbers, pumpkins are susceptible to the same diseases      and insects common to other cucurbit crops. In fact, squash      bugs (also called stink bugs because of their obnoxious      odor) and squash vine borers prefer squash and pumpkins to      other members of the cucurbit family.    </p>    <p>      Squash bugs (brownish black and about 3/4-inch long) feed      on plant tissues until the vines wilt and die. They can be      handpicked, as can their brick-red eggs found lying in      clusters on the leaves. These pests can be controlled by      sowing repellent plants, such as radishes, nasturtiums or      marigolds, around the patch. For severe infestations, trap      the bugs under boards, dust them with diatomaceous earth,      or-if necessary-use rotenone. Squash bugs are      generally more of a problem with the smaller bush-type      varieties, so if you can't spend much time in your pumpkin      patch, you may want to plant one of the field types, which      are less attractive to these insects.    </p>    <p>      Squash vine borers (white, one-inch-long caterpillars with      brown heads) tunnel into stems, causing the plant to wilt.      To keep ahead of this problem, look for small holes with      sawdustlike droppings. If you spot one, slit open the stem,      pull out the pest, and put the stem back together with      masking tape or cover it with dirt at the rupture point so      it will reroot. <em>Bacillus thuringiensis,</em> lime dust      and wood ashes also discourage these destructive borers.    </p>    <p>      Cucumber beetles (1/4-inch long with black heads and yellow      or green wings with black spots or stripes) can chew the      leaves off the vines. Even worse, they spread bacterial      wilt, which begins with the wilting of a single leaf,      followed by the gradual demise of the entire plant. Again,      radishes planted nearby will tempt the disease-spreading      beetles away from the pumpkins, or you can control the bugs      with pyrethrum or rotenone. Other defenses are to cover the      young plants with cheesecloth and to mulch them heavily. If      a plant is struck down with bacterial wilt, destroy it to      keep the disease from spreading.    </p>    <p>      To prevent anthracnose (a soil-borne fungus which shows up      on leaves as hollow, water-soaked spots that become large      and turn brown) and downy mildew (irregular yellow or      purplish spots on leaves, which later curl up and die),      plant a resistant variety of pumpkin and practice crop      rotation on a three- or four-year basis. And while you're      at it, eliminate perennial weeds around your plot, so downy      mildew will have no place to overwinter.    </p>    <h3>      How to Harvest and Store    </h3>    <p>      A few weeks before the first fall frost, cut the tips off      the plants and pick any small fruits to encourage the      growth of the remaining pumpkins. The pumpkins are mature      when you can't pierce the skins easily with a fingernail.      Another sign is that the vines of ripe pumpkins usually      begin to wither and the stems become dry. Cut the stems a      few inches from the fruit with a sharp knife, and cure the      pumpkins in the sun for a few weeks. As the stems dry, they      form a barrier to the bacteria and molds that cause      pumpkins to rot. Be sure that those you intend to store are      harvested <em>before</em> the first frost, to prevent the      shells from growing soft. Store them in a dry (60% to 75%      humidity) basement, storage room, shed or attic at about      50° to 55°F, and they will keep from three to six      months.    </p>    <p>      You can preserve your pumpkin harvest for longer periods by      canning, freezing or drying the meat. To can or freeze it,      wash the whole pumpkin, cut it into pieces, and cook it      until tender in boiling water, steam, the oven or a      pressure cooker. Scoop the pulp from the skin (removing      seeds and strings), and mash it or press it through a      ricer, sieve or food mill. For canned pumpkin, place the      mashed pulp in clean jars topped with canning lids, and      process them - 65 minutes for pints and 80 for quarts      - at 10 pounds of pressure. The results will be a bit      mushy, and frozen pumpkin is more like fresh. To freeze,      completely cool the cooked meat by stirring it in a      saucepan or bowl set in ice water. Pack the pumpkin in      containers, leaving about 1/4 inch of head space for pints      and a good 1/2 inch for quarts. Seal, label and freeze.    </p>    <p>      To dry pumpkin, select only those fruits that are mature      and firm. Cut them into chunks, scrape out the seeds and      strings, peel, and carve into thin, one-inch-wide slices.      Blanch these in boiling water for about one minute or in      steam for two-and-a-half to three minutes. After draining      and patting dry with paper towels, place the slices in a      single, even layer on cookie sheets or on racks. Dry these      in the sun, over a woodstove, in a dehydrator or in a low      oven from four to 12 hours until no moisture remains.      (Thinner slices may be brittle.) Store them in a dry place      or airtight container. Rehydrate each cup of pumpkin in      three cups of boiling water for about one hour.    </p>    <p>      To dry pumpkinseeds, first wash them thoroughly in cold      water to remove all pulp and strings. Rinse and drain them      well, and pat them dry with towels. Spread the seeds in a      single, even layer on paper towels on cookie sheets, and      place these in a warm, dry spot for 12 to 24 hours. Such      seeds can be used for planting the next season, or they can      be sprouted. To do so, place one-and-a-half cups of seeds      in a one-quart jar or a sprout tray. Let them soak for 10      hours, then rinse the seeds two or three times daily for      two to three days. Harvest the sprouts when they're an inch      or so long. This should yield about a quart of sprouts to      use in soups, salads and stir-fry dishes.    </p>    <p>      For snacks and garnishes, roast washed and dried seeds in a      350°F oven for 20 minutes or until crisp and light      brown.    </p>    <p>      Cooked pumpkin is surprisingly nutritious. One-half cup      contains about 7,500 units of vitamin A, along with an      assortment of B vitamins, vitamin C, potassium, phosphorus,      calcium and iron - but only 27 calories. It's also      known to help elevate low blood pressure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The following pumpkin recipes are favorites of our      staff:</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Simple Pumpkin Soup    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons margarine</em> <em>1/4 cup chopped green      pepper</em> <em>1 small onion, finely chopped</em> <em>2      tablespoons flour</em> <em>1 teaspoon salt</em> <em>2 cups      chicken stock or broth</em> <em>2 cups pumpkin puree</em>      <em>2 cups milk</em> <em>1/8 teaspoon thyme</em> <em>1/4      teaspoon nutmeg</em> <em>1 teaspoon chopped parsley</em>      <em>Parsley sprigs for garnish</em>    </p>    <p>      Melt margarine in a large pan.
