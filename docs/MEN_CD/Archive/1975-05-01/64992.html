                    <h3>       DARYL ANN KYLE:    </h3>    <p>      Eleanor Wrigley's "Report from Alberta, Canada" (MOTHER NO.      31) mentioned the problem of "hip-lock" in calving. May I      offer <em>a</em> suggestion gleaned from a dairy farmer for      whom I milked cows? He kept Holsteins and was breeding a      lot of the heifers to exotic beef sires. Now, granted, a      Holstein heifer is pretty big as heifers go, but the calves      were still large enough to cause trouble during birth . . .      mainly hiplock.    </p>    <p>      One day my dairyman boss told me the following: The average      cow's pelvis is not equally wide and deep, and many      hip-locked calves will slip out easily if their bodies can      be turned 90 degrees. This method also helps alleviate the      damage to the hips of the calf which is often caused by      <em>forceful pulling</em> . Although I didn't deliver any      of the young myself, 1 often watched my employer as he used      the above procedure with good success.    </p>    <p>      Eleanor's suggestion that a cow be bred for offspring of      the correct size is surely the safest way to an easy      delivery. Problems can, however, arise with any first-calf      heifer-including the homesteader's cherished      milker-to-be-and the technique of turning the      hiplocked fetus is easy and safe for the beginner.    </p>    <p>      (Incidentally, readers who are raising their own cattle can      surely benefit by the use of artificial insemination. Sires      are of the highest quality, fees are reasonable, and      inseminators are readily available in rural areas. Ask your      county extension agent for help in locating this service.)    </p>    <p>      Once a calf is safely born, MOTHER's children may wish to      preserve its mother's beneficial colostrum ("first milk")      for the young animal's use instead of eating it themselves.      The colostrurn may be refrigerated for a week or more, or      frozen and kept for months . . . and it's wise to have a      few quarts in the freezer in case your calf gets sick.      Small amounts of this vital food mixed with water will      often bring dramatic improvement. The same frozen supply is      equally handy for starting lambs that are orphaned at      birth.    </p>    <p>      Colostrum can also be pickled. Find a large plastic or      unchipped enamel container or crock, put what you don't      feed of the first three milkings into the bowl, and let the      accumulation stand at room temperature. It will sour and      begin to smell like yeast dough (don't use it until this      point is reached). The thickened fluid can then be stored      in a cool-not freezing-place. At feeding time,      mix one part pickled colostrum and one part hot water to      make warm milk.    </p>    <p>      By the way, my father has fed pigs skim milk clabbered with      yogurt starter and swears by it. He just sets out a barrel,      puts in milk and a bit of yogurt, and then adds fresh milk      daily. The bacteria change over the course of time with      this method, so every now and then he starts fresh with a      new yogurt culture (from store or home). We're going to      prepare the same food for chickens with our extra skim milk      as soon as our beautiful cow Ida calves. (We admit to      hoping for twin heifers . . . nothing like optimism!)    </p>    <p>      Speaking of chickens . . . experience has taught me that      feeding them whey without additional water gives the poor      birds diarrhea. And if you use a heat lamp in the henhouse      to encourage laying in cold weather-as Eleanor      describes-try a red one. Our flock has a lengthened      day through a timed white light, but the red heat lamp      stays on all the time during chilly periods and egg      production has remained steady all winter.    </p>      <h3>RON SAWYER:</h3>     <p>      Eleanor Wrigley's "Report from Alberta, Canada" (MOTHER NO.      31) is discouraging enough to deter even the most eager      homesteader front obtaining a cow, because of the "calving      problem". This is all wrong, since in the vast majority of      cases human interference is not necessary or even wise.      Most often, when corrct presentation is evidenced, the      worst thing one can do is intervene and probably botch up a      normal birth.    </p>    <p>      Modern methods of "assistance" during bovine labor are      analagous to hospital delivery of human babies by knocking      the mother cold and yanking out the child with forceps. If      you don't concur with the latter, then why practice the      former on your innocent <em>four-footed companion</em> ?      Patience is a virtue in calving, just as it is in human      delivery. Precipitous action can only lead to tragedy.    </p>    <p>      The first stage of bovine labor (dilation of the cervix)      generally takes up to six hours or more, while the second      stage (expulsive) occupies up to another six hours. The      time span from the moment the feet appear at the vulva to      the emergence of the tongue and subsequently the nose will      seem interminable if you don't know that it's quite normal.      Give the cow a chance to deliver her own baby.    </p>    <p>      As for the calf-puller, it not only looks like something      left over from a medieval torture chamber . . . it is. It      should be banned from the face of the earth. Farmers have a      way of attaching the instrument to the calf the moment its      legs appear at the vulva and then literally ripping the      young out of the mother, doing irreparable damage to the      cow by tearing her cervix.    </p>    <p>      True cases of hip-lock are probably much rarer than is      imagined. Breeding a heifer to a Charolais or Friesian      (Holstein) bull is one of its causes.    </p>    <p>      When hip-lock does occur, force is completely      contraindicated. Simply rolling the cow onto her back and      over to her opposite side, and then offering gentle      assistance, will bring about delivery in around 50 percent      of such cases. Another form of aid consists of rotating the      calf on its own axis to effect its release. If nothing      works and a vet is available, he might have to cut up the      calf within the cow (embryotomy) to save the latter's life.      The solution is never a matter of "just a little more      force".    </p>    <p>      There is only one circumstance in which more than a single      strong person should pull on a calf to deliver it. That      exception is a posterior presentation . . . and even then      it's not necessary to panic and start yanking immediately.      Not until full cervical dilation is effected should gentle      pulling, one leg at a time, be undertaken. When the entire      hind end of the calf is outside the vulva, get those strong      onlookers to help you . . . and quickly. The umbilical cord      will rupture at this point and you have 30 to 40 seconds to      deliver a live baby. You can't hurt the mother because the      widest part of the fetus is already through the cervix and      pelvis.    </p>    <p>      In cases other than posterior presentation, the umbilical      cord rarely ruptures before the calf's head is well outside      the vulva . . . provided that steady, brute, outside force      has not been used. Thus the best way to protect both      mother's and offspring's life is not by speed or strength,      but by an educated policy of non- or limited interference.    </p>    <p>      Within reason, there is no need to muddle in on bovine      labor.. . any more than you would deny a woman her right to      natural delivery. If you're convinced by Lester D.      Hazzell's <em>Commonsense Childbirth,</em> then you'll find      equal satisfaction in <em>Calving</em> <em>the Cow and Care      of the Calf</em> by the TV Vet (this letter owes everything      to him). It's the best book I've ever read on the subject      and includes hundreds of marvelous photographs: normal      calving, Caesarean section, etc. This work-by one of      England's top vets-is available for about $7.50 from      Farming Press Ltd., Fenton House, Wharfedale Road, Ipswich,      Suffolk, England.    </p>        <h3>      ALAN SMITH:    </h3>    <p>      I've read the chapter from <em>Farming</em> <em>for      Self-Sufficiency</em> reprinted in MOTHER NO. 27, and would      like to add some important points to remember when a cow is      calving . . . a very beautiful occasion, but also very      serious.    </p>    <p>      One of the first signs that a cow is about to give birth is      a dropping in of the sides of the tail just above the      pelvis. Labor should then begin, and the water      bag-which lubricates and cushions mother and young      before and during delivery-should appear shortly      thereafter. (You'll know what it is as soon as you see it.)    </p>    <p>      Should two hours pass after the early signs without the      appearance of the water bag or any indication of calving,      it's time to find out what's wrong. A cow which is let go      much longer than that becomes exhausted and also exhausts      the calf. If the mother is too worn out to continue with      the birth process, you may lose both her and her baby.    </p>    <p>      "Diving in"-as the Seymours describe-to correct      a wrong presentation is insane unless you know exactly what      to do and how to do it. If you happen to scratch or damage      the uterus with your hand or one of the calf's feet, your      cow might not be able to calve anymore . . . and could      possibly die. A veterinarian should he called, if possible,      to straighten things out. Yes, that costs money, but it's a      heck of a lot less expensive than a dead or injured animal.    </p>    <p>      When pulling a calf, always apply the force more downward      than backward or straight out. The fetus must follow the      direction of the birth canal, or a broken back could      result. (The drawing will show you what I mean.) Remember      also to pull one foreleg ahead of the other so that the      shoulders move through the pelvis separately rather than      both at the same time.    </p>    <p>      Once the cow begins to calve with your assistance, keep      pulling constantly and firmly. If you stop, the calf's hips      will sometimes (not always) become lodged in the pelvis...      and "hip-lock" is a difficult situation to remedy.    </p>    <p>      This may sound like a lot to remember, but all the things      I've mentioned are worth knowing if you have to use them      even once. Of course-as John and Sally say-if      you don't breed a heifer too young or too small, and if      she's properly fed and not fat, there should be no      difficulty in calving.    </p>    <p>      It's also good to know that an injection of vitamins A, D,      and E (3 cc when the calf is one day old) gives the newborn      a real boost against infection and disease.    </p>    <p>      The above information was gained by watching 150 calves      being born and assisting in at least 50 births over a      period of three months. I hope it helps someone.    </p>
