            		     <p><strong>MARJ WATKINS</strong> "After thirty," says the      proverb, "you're either a fool or your own physician."      Maybe before thirty, too . . . especially if you live in an      isolated-spot and/or have a big bump of independence. Of      course, you're a bigger fool still if you meddle with a      serious or persistent condition... but both you and your      overworked doctor will be better off if you can prevent or      cure your own minor ills... as Marj Watkins began pointing      out in MOTHER NO. 28. Here's the final installment of the      health hints that work for her family.    </p>      <h3>VAGINAL INFECTION OR      IRRITATION</h3>       <p>      Vaginal inflammations seem to occur inevitably when a      woman's body is short of vitamins A and E. The problems      will usually subside when 100,000 units of vitamin A and      200 of vitamin E are taken daily for three days.    </p>    <p>      A douche of one tablespoon of vinegar to a quart of water      will combat yeasts and fungi and can be used daily to fight      infection by these organisms or by bacteria. Used      occasionally, it will keep <em>Monilia</em> fungus at bay.    </p>    <p>      Gentian violet, prepared as a suppository and sold on      prescription, is the most effective remedy for trichomonad      and <em>Monilia</em> infections. Doctors often hesitate to      prescribe this medicine because it's a strong dye . . . but      that's no problem when a tampon is used with the      suppository.    </p>     <h3>VEIN PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      <strong>VARICOSE VEINS:</strong> Although they often begin      with a pregnancy, varicose veins can happen to anybody. To      make them go away, or at least not get worse, rest with      your legs above hip level five minutes out of each hour if      at all possible. (Use a slant-board . . . perhaps your      ironing board with one end on the floor and the other on a      sofa.)    </p>    <p>      Wear good support hose. Finish every bath with cold water      applied to the varicose-vein area to firm your skin, or      apply alternate hot and cold packs to your elevated legs.      Do bicycling exercises with your legs in the air.    </p>    <p>      Increase the oxygen in your bloodstream by learning to      breathe with your entire lungs. Walk daily, fifteen minutes      at first and working up to an hour. Afterward, rest on your      back with your legs raised. Sit up slowly to avoid      dizziness.    </p>    <p>      Take 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C night and morning, with      vitamin E as directed under ACHES AND PAINS (MOTHER NO.      29). Drink a glass of milk at the same time for calcium,      protein, and other helpful elements.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HEMMORRHOIDS:</strong> To prevent this trouble,      keep the bowels functioning well with plenty of raw fruits      and vegetables, fruit juices, dried prunes and figs, and      herb teas. Keep the abdominal muscles trim by walking,      swimming, and bicycling.    </p>    <p>      To overcome hemorrhoids, eat cottage cheese, poached fish,      applesauce, soybean products, lentils, dried and fresh      peas, stir-fried assorted vegetables, mashed potatoes (dice      small and cook without peeling), and butter or gravy. Don't      eat sugar, candy, or white flour products or drink coffee      or strong tea. These give you nothing but calories or      stimulation, while robbing you of essential B vitamins.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PHLEBITIS:</strong> This condition is the      inflammation of a vein, with swelling, itching, burning,      and sometimes a general physical upset. It probably won't      happen to you if you eat well and exercise faithfully. If      it does, go at once to your vitamin C source and take 1,000      units with milk at each meal, between meals, and at      bedtime.    </p>    <p>      Also take vitamin E, beginning with 100 units each morning.      In a few days, add another 100 units at night. After a few      more days, increase again. Some very active people control      vein problems with 600 to 800 units of vitamin E daily, but      you may find 200 enough in combination with leg-up rest and      cold packs. Honey and peach kernel oil lotion gently      massaged into the skin will relieve itching. Eat plenty of      parsley, liver, whole grains, and dairy products.    </p>    <h3>WARTS</h3>    <p>      Puncture a vitamin E capsule and squeeze the oil onto the      wart. Cover the area with a Band-Aid. Repeat the treatment      daily for three days.    </p>    <h3>WOUNDS</h3>     <p>      A healthy, happy person who is in tune with the rest of the      universe doesn't attract accidents or hurts . . . but it      sometimes happens that a barefoot child, for instance, in a      moment of doubt or inattention steps on a piece of glass      left by some out-of-tune individual.    </p>    <p>      If there is much bleeding, elevate the wounded part and      press against the injury with a clean cloth or a handful of      grass or soft leaves. Any dirt or foreign matter in the      wound will prevent healing and must be gently removed. If      there is none, just bandage the injury . . . the blood will      have washed it. A hurt that has not bled well should be      cleaned with mild soap and water and then bandaged. No      other antiseptic is needed.    </p>    <p>      It's necessary to keep the injury, and the skin around it,      protected with a bandage and a sock or other clothing.      Otherwise new dirt can get in and cause infection later. If      infection does set in, soak the part several times a day in      a salt solution as hot as can be borne.    </p>    <h3>"THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH"</h3>    <p>      I'll conclude this series with my recipe for good health.      It's really not a fountain but a cornucopia: an abundant      assortment of fruits and vegetables, as fresh from the      earth as possible, grown without insecticides or artificial      fertilizers.    </p>    <p>      My stay-young formula also includes sea      vegetables-kelp, dulse, bladder wrack, and sea      lettuce-for their 67 different minerals. I use them      in oyster stew, clam and fish chowders, sneak ground kelp      into beef stew, meatballs, herb-fried chicken,      sesame-coated baked fish, and shepherd's pie. Anywhere a      land herb can go, sea herbs can go too, accompanied by      basil, marjoram, ginger, cumin, thyme, or whatever. In a      recipe for four or five people I use one-half to one      teaspoon of ground kelp, depending on the dish. One can      also stir a teaspoon of kelp into a glass of tomato juice      for a morning pickup.    </p>    <p>      Well, that's it . . . the simple methods of prevention and      healing that keep our family in good shape and out of the      doctor's office. I hope they work as well for you as they      have for us.    </p>
