             		    <h5 id="byline">    by ELIZABETH CAILE    </h5>     <p>      Land that tilts like a roller coaster, a growing season of      indeterminate length that may well include frost or snow,      the absence of suitable directions on seed packets . . .      those are some of the challenges that confront you when you      plant a garden at an altitude of 8,000 or 9,000 feet. Even      the back issues of that reliable old friend <em>Organic      Gardening</em> seem to forsake you up where the air is thin      and often chilly, and the prospects for gardening success      at first seem slim.    </p>    <p>      Still, if your green thumb really itches, bumper crops of      splendid turnips, potatoes, cabbages, onions, garlic, and      herbs can be yours without any real difficulty as high up      as the timberline if you know how to grow them. And when      you succeed, you get superb food along with the      satisfaction of mastering the fine-tuning of one of the      world's more exotic natural environments.    </p>    <p>      I live in a small cabin on a mining claim in a national      forest in Colorado, high on the eastern slope of the Rocky      Mountains. And I find that my greatest pleasure in living      here is learning the glories and subtleties of nature . . .      and the ways of plants. I am surrounded by a wildness still      intact enough to be an overwhelming force in my life, a      wildness that makes me, as a gardener, want to learn what      vegetables grow here best and most naturally, with the      least amount of care and manipulation of the environment.      The following approach to gardening has brought me a wealth      of food and has helped me preserve the wildness a little      longer. And it may tell other high-country gardeners how to      do the same.    </p>    <p>      First, if you garden in that fascinating zone between 3,000      feet above sea level and the Alpine tundra where even trees      don't grow, you must realize that the sunshine, moisture,      temperatures, and soils all vary greatly over relatively      small areas and short periods of time. This is because the      land rises and dips steeply except for broad, high meadows      that taper off into narrow gulches choked with willow and      alder. Thus, every slope and its plants has its own      relationship to the sun. Slopes facing north receive the      least sunlight, and are cool and refreshing in late summer,      when land tilted south is parched and dry. And slopes      facing east get the morning sun, while those directed west      are warmed even more by late afternoon rays.    </p>    <p>      A good example of this variability, and the adaptability it      brings, can be seen in a healthy fruit tree that may grow      in a sunny, protected crease of a hillside . . . but      wouldn't have a chance of survival if it were planted ten      to twenty feet away from that warm pocket.    </p>    <p>      My mountain garden is on a strip of meadow in a gulch, and      is protected from high winds. It is wetter, and its soil      richer, than surrounding hillsides, yet it is cooler at      night and more subject to frosts . . . the cold air of      evening rolls downhill like a river and into such gulches.      So I have learned to plant only frost-resistant vegetables.      And most of these vegetables outlast the neighboring meadow      grasses in the fall to glow startlingly green in the midst      of a dull gray and tan mountain landscape.    </p>    <p>      Another special factor for mountain gardeners to consider      is the thinness of the atmosphere at high altitudes. This      causes water to evaporate faster from the ground. You could      say that the air itself provides less insulation for      conserving water, so it is important to provide your own      insulation for a garden in the form of a thick but      lightweight mulch of dry grasses or straw. This mulch will      keep the garden soil soft. Otherwise, unnaturally exposed      by the digging up of mountain grasses as you spade the      dirt, it would quickly become dry and hard. Old bedding      from horse corrals is a good mulch for some purposes, and      both nourishes and insulates. And such is the      protectiveness of this covering, that in the bleakness of      spring, the earliest green things you find will be safely      hidden under the natural mulch of last year's gasses and      wildflowers.    </p>    <p>      Next you must realize that Rocky Mountain soils lack the      range of nutrients needed for many garden vegetables, so      you have to dig in plenty of aged manure when you first      clear a garden plot. For this purpose I recycle weeds,      kitchen waste, and the refuse from the spring cleaning of      my chicken coop . . . sometimes digging the manure and      wastes directly into the garden soil, or composting it for      a year. For additional nutrients I use the weeds I have      pulled as mulch at the end of each summer.    </p>    <p>      Mountain soils, by the way, are often acidic at higher      elevations, because they were created from granite rather      than the alkaline sandstones and limestones of lower      elevations, and because of the acid content of decomposing      pine needles. Very acidic soils can be moderated by the      addition of wood ashes. But if you heat with wood, these      are easy to come by. The soils of meadows and aspen groves      are richer, however, and less likely to be acidic than      those near coniferous forests.    </p>    <p>      The first year I lived high in the Rockies I gardened      without irrigation. The next year I used a 300-foot hose to      take additional water from the spring to the garden when it      was needed. But there is more rain at higher elevations in      the Rockies than at lower elevations, so with careful      observation and practice you will learn to plant a garden      which is wholly sympathetic to natural conditions and that      may not need irrigation. Hopi Indians, in fact, have farmed      with great success for centuries without irrigation . . .      in what at first glance appears to be barren desert.    </p>    <p>      At the start of the season you must anticipate the green of      summer, which is a little hard to do after six or seven      months of snow. That is when you learn that to garden      successfully in the Rockies what you perhaps need most is      optimism. Winter holds tight in March . . . while spring is      only vaguely hinted at by the wetness of the month's      snowfalls. Then in April the softening of the ground and      the appearance of the purple Easter-egg-like pasque flower      in the pine forests become more obvious signals of spring.      Still, the landscape seems desolate compared with the      brilliant green fuzz beginning to show at lower altitudes.    </p>    <p>      The actual length of winter, alas, is as variable as other      conditions in the Rockies, so it is good to buy seeds,      sets, and roots early. Then you'll have them when the first      opportunities for planting come, and not find nurseries      sold out.    </p>    <p>      Then come days in late April when the warmth of the air and      soil surprise you like a miracle. Looking under the natural      mulch of the meadow, or that of last year's garden, you      find the soil has thawed and tiny green leaves are      sprouting. That's when the gardener's heart within you      begins to quicken. One native you may want to start with is      the <em>Umbelliferae</em> family, which appears early and      vigorously. Late April is the time to plant the domestic      relatives in this family: parsley, carrots, and parsnips.      Domestic varieties take all summer to mature, though      carrots can be thinned and enjoyed the latter half of the      summer. Fennel, similar in appearance to the wild whisk      broom parsley, also takes all summer to mature and should      be planted as early as possible. It is a licoricelike herb      which flowers in June, and its leaves are great for salad      and vegetable seasoning. You might say that its stalks and      bases are a sort of Rocky Mountain celery.    </p>    <p>      Next there are leaf lettuce, spinach, turnips, and      radishes, all of which will grow vigorously under a mulch      through the snows and frosts of May and early June.      Everything but the turnips will be going to seed by      mid-July, so plan to make a second planting.    </p>    <p>      Leaf lettuce and endive are related to many edible wild      species of thistles and dandelions that flourish in high,      gassy meadows and along roadsides of the Rockies.      Lamb's-quarters, a wild herb, is similar to spinach and      springs up in disturbed soil at high altitudes. I weed it      sparingly from my garden since it is delicious steamed or      in salads.    </p>    <p>      Onion and garlic sets are also best started very early,      while onion plants, like cabbage and broccoli (which must      be started indoors and set out as plants to mature in the      short growing season), are better set out when the possible      wintry days of May have passed. That is also when you plant      beet seeds . . . after the soil has warmed up a bit.    </p>    <p>      Sweet peas and edible pod peas have natural equivalents in      many wild species (none too edible, some poisonous).      Planted with the other early starters, they come up quickly      and are rapidly climbing trellises by June. They need to be      watered in middle and late summer to keep bearing after the      first pods have formed, since they would provide an      unpredictable harvest without irrigation.    </p>    <p>      In mid-May spring still seems far away to the casual      observer from lower altitudes. The willow-like catkins of      still-leafless aspen trees mature, hang loose on the trees,      and fill the air with a white fuzz like gentle snow. But an      old, lifelong gardener in our neighborhood assures me that      this is the best time to plant potatoes.    </p>    <p>      Potatoes are not frost resistant, but they are an almost      carefree crop with abundant yields even when frost touches      down on a mid-August night, leaving behind wilted, dying      plants.    </p>    <p>      A few tips on growing this crop: Buy genuine seed potatoes      for stock . . . regular store potatoes have been treated to      retard sprouting and will never mature properly. The larger      the portion cut for starting, the more potatoes will be      produced per plant. Plant the pieces about five inches deep      and cover your rows with six inches of straw. In two or      three weeks fat shoots of fuzzy leaves push up through the      sod, but they must be protected from early June frosts.    </p>    <p>      Another valuable tuber for high-altitude gardens is the      Jerusalem artichoke . . . like a potato, it can be boiled,      baked, or fried, and it stores well. It is a close relative      of the tall, ragged sunflower that comes up in abundance      along mountain roads and ditches, forming thick, yellow      borders when it flowers in August. And the Jerusalem      artichoke grows almost as naturally, once it is introduced.    </p>    <p>      You may want to plant a corner of your garden with beds of      perennial strawberries, chives, and garlic. Domestic straw      berry plants adapt easily to mountain conditions, and wilt;      strawberries can also be transplanted, and bear more      heavily it cultivated. Rhubarb has been introduced by      settlers ant miners in moist gulches in our neighborhood,      and it thrive untended like a weed. I have also established      some spearmint plants along the damp runoff from the      spring.    </p>    <p>      Keep your eye on what grows naturally around you. The      native flora of the Rocky . Mountains is also a good food      source, and gives you clues as to what domestic vegetables      will adapt best to high-altitude conditions. It also,      incidentally provides natural insect repellents. Once you      learn the appearance of these plants in early spring, you      can have them in your garden simply by weeding judiciously.      Two common herbs that I allow to grow to repel garden      insects are chamomile and sage. These can also be useful      for tea as well as seasoning.    </p>    <p>      I have even experimented with a "greenhouse" for growing,      vegetables that need more warmth than high altitudes and a      gulch location provide. The greenhouse is an A-frame built      with used 2 X 4's and covered with plastic. I have grown      tomatoes, cucumbers, and zucchini in it as well as      tremendous heads of lettuce and twoweek crops of radishes.    </p>    <p>      Except for vegetables which thrive well outside, such as      lettuce, the others have not done well . . . zucchini will      nor bear heavily inside the greenhouse because of the high      humidity and the lack of pollinating insects. Perhaps a      more favorable location than mine, one that is on a high,      protected west-facing slope, may be better for growing      these warm-weather vegetables at unusually high altitudes.    </p>    <p>      I am also satisfied with crops that grow here like weeds      and in abundance. I have sweet lettuce and spinach to share      with from the lowlands when it has grown too hot down there      for these leafy greens. And the cool nights of the Rock      Mountains give the same sweetness found in greens to the      peas beets, turnips, cabbage, and other vegetables grown      here . . . which, like fresh spring water, refreshes more      than the moss exotic produce brought in from elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      The final satisfaction of Rocky Mountain gardening comes in      the tawny days of fall, when you dig potatoes, harvest the      last of the root crops, and store what remains in cardboard      boxes of sawdust or straw, to be stowed under the beds it      unheated backrooms. Then you dry the herbs, and put chives      and parsley in pots for your neighbors' kitchen      windowsills. Finally, you cover the garden with dry grasses      and dead weeds to rest protected till next spring.    </p>    <p>      As winter then approaches, you may linger outside to      observe individual plants and their growth patterns . . .      there is always more to be learned about the workings of      nature that will be useful to your gardening efforts next      year.    </p>    <p>      The real challenge of Rocky Mountain gardening, you will      find, is not so much that of outfoxing nature and the      difficult conditions she imposes. Mostly, it lies in      harmonizing your efforts with hers for a healthy, abundant,      deeply satisfying harvest.    </p>
