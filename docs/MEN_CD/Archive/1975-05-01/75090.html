    <p>
                    <p>      One of the world's most effective environmental groups is      San Francisco-based FRIENDS OF THE EARTH. Although FOE      publishes <em>Not Man Apart-a</em> monthly tabloid      magazine packed with authenticated, hard-to-find facts that      every concerned citizen needs-far too few of MOTHER's      readers regularly see a copy of <em>NMA.</em> We are      therefore quite pleased that FOE's staff has agreed to      write a regular FRIENDS OF THE EARTH column for THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS (restricted) .    </p>     <h3>NUCLEAR POWER: THE BATTLE HEATS UP</h3>    <p>      The mysterious death of Karen Silkwood, a lab technician at      the Kerr-McGee plutonium facility in Oklahoma, has helped      expose a large number of Americans to the realities of the      nuclear power controversy. Ms. Silkwood-while driving      to meet with <em>New York Times</em> reporter David Brunham      and Steve Wodka, an official of the Oil, Chemical, and      Atomic Worker's Union-was killed in what nay prove to      be a not-quite-accidental auto crash. She was allegedly      carrying documents injurious to both her employer and the      entire nuclear industry. Many daily papers and      periodicals-including Time, <em>Rolling</em> Stone,      Ms., Newsweek, and <em>.New</em> Times-have carried      articles on the case, and have taken the opportunity to      elaborate on the growing national opposition to nuclear      power.    </p>    <p>      * * * * * * * *    </p>    <p>      In other atom-smashing news: An issue which is virtually      certain to qualify for the June 19'96 ballot in California      will require the nuclear industry to prove to the state      legislature-within one yearthat [1] reactors are      reasonably safe, [2] the companies producing nuclear power      are fully insured against liability, and [3] that a      reliable radioactive waste disposal system exists.    </p>    <p>      * * * * * * * *    </p>    <p>      Industry spokesmen denounce the measure as a "nuclear      moratorium" . . . but backers-composed mostly of      major environmental groups and many consumer      organizations-point out that such a halt would result      only if those same spokesmen cannot furnish the required      proof of safety and financial responsibility.    </p>    <p>      * * * * * * * *    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, moratorium measures <em>have been</em>      introduced in 12 state legislatures, as well as in the U.S.      Senate and House of Representatives. And in Barnet,      Vermont, voters turned thumbs down on a proposed nuclear      station-to be located across the Connecticut River in      Monroe, New Hampshire-by a whopping margin of 190 to      2.    </p>    <p>      * * * * * * * *    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, power companies are not taking the      antinuclear movement lying down. A secret Atomic Industrial      Forum (AIF) memorandum-leaked to FOE and published in      Not Man Apart-outlines a massive public relations      campaign to sell atomic-based energy to the American      public. Among their tactics will be ghostwritten articles      supposedly authored by prominent figures (and the direct      placement of those articles in publications "to eliminate      the filtration factor of reporters and editors") as well as      press conferences featuring scientific noteworthies as star      performers, The AIF people are apparently implementing      their designs with an all-out effort: Shortly after their      memo was sent out, Hans Bethe (a well-known physicist) and      31 other scientists released a signed statement saying      nuclear power is "best (of all".    </p>       <h3>THE BROWNING OF THE NATIONAL PARKS?</h3>      <p>      Should private companies overload national parks in order      to increase profits? This question is now being actively      discussed in the wake of a "mini scandal" involving the      Music Corporation of America (MCA).    </p>    <p>      Last year, when the National Park Service was devising a      master plan for the future development of Yosemite, man.      observers felt that MCA (the principal owner of concessions      in that park) exerted undue influence on the government      agency's designs for projected improvements. As a result,      an aroused citizenry forced the parties involved to scrap      their; "blueprint" and start over . . . and to include the      general public in all subsequent deliberations. Two      suggestions, commonly proposed now are that the Service      turn all concessions, over to non-profit corporations, and      phase autos out of park areas.    </p>     <h3>ECONOMY DOWN THE DRAIN . . . ENVIRONMENT UP THE      STACK?</h3>     <p>      The White House and some captains of industry are putting      more and more of the blame for the country's economic      difficulties on environmental protection . . . despite the      facts that polls repeatedly show the public knows      otherwise.    </p>    <p>      The new administration in California, however, isn't being      fooled. When EPA administrator Russ Train announced he w:;.      giving auto manufacturers two additional years to meet      federal emission control standards, the California Air      Resources Board countered with new and even tougher smog      rules for the state.    </p>     <h3>FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL READER</h3>     <p>      The unchallenged box-office favorite for "book of the year"      around the Friends of the Earth office is Lewis Thomas      <em>The Lives of a Cell</em> (Viking, $6.95). Dr. Thomas'      beautifully written insights into biology are enlightening,      inspiring, and often humorous.    </p>    <p>      Another good volume is <em>World Energy Strategies: Facts      Issues, and Options</em> by Amory Lovins. The author      provides brilliant survey of various energy-conversion      systems, their hazards and potential benefits, and possible      ways to curtail waste and reduce consumption. FOE and the      Ballinger Publishing Company are joint publishers of the      book and order may be placed through our office . . . the      price is $4.95, or $3.95 for Friends of the Earth members.    </p>    <p>      A really major disappointment is <em>Mankind at the Turning      Point: The Second Report to the Club of Rome</em> (Dutton      Reader's Digest Press, $12.95). The first "Report to the      Club of Rome", of course, was <em>The Limits to Growth</em>      <em>. . .</em> certainly <em>,</em> an important book. In      contrast, <em>Mankind-</em> prepared by a team at      Case Western Reserve University-fogs the essential      facts, endorses an ill-defined concept of "organic growth",      arbitrarily divides the earth into ten illogical regions,      and is gratuitious about its illustrious predecessor, (Hugh      Nash's superb two-part review of <em>Mankind--which</em>      appeared in FOE's newsletter-is available upon request,)    </p>      <h3>FOE'S PRESIDENT SPEAKS OUT</h3>     <p>      A! a recent New York conference, David Brower set down an      item-by-item list of suggestions on how to put people to      work healing old scars-instead of making new      ones-in the name of economic recovery:    </p>    <p>      Revitalize the railroads. President Ford has just released      two billion dollars for construction of new highways (a      curious way to conserve gasoline) . . . that same money      could go a long way toward putting the railways back in      business. Let the Army Corps of Engineers fix existing      roadways, instead of destroy riverbeds.    </p>    <p>      Finance public transit in cities.    </p>    <p>      Build sailing ships-using present knowledge of      weather and aerodynamics-as profitable alternatives      to our Current fuelhungry vessels.    </p>    <p>      Reopen a canal every year. (Barges can be beautiful!)    </p>    <p>      Revitalize small towns and use open areas for space and      productive purposes, such as growing food. Modern rail      service-and the decimation of the auto      population-will help reestablish villages and hamlets      as places where life is enjoyed. Live close to where you      work.    </p>    <p>      Institute more bans on automobiles in cities and high      population areas. If Rome and Mexico City can do it, why      not New York, Washington, San. Francisco, and Los Angeles?    </p>    <p>      Process organic waste for energy and fertilizer. Make sure      the multibillions spent for pollution abatement includes      funds for recycling usable elements. Stop wholesale      offshore dumping.    </p>    <p>      Step up efforts in genetic research to find less      energy-intensive agricultural strains that offer more      resistance to disease. Study the French methods for growing      greater amounts of food on smaller areas of land, using      reduced amounts of water and energy . . . and no chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Reclaim strip-mined lands rind outer derelict parts of      America.    </p>    <p>      Use more labor and fewer man-made fertilizers, herbicides,      and pesticides on farms.    </p>    <p>      Insulate all the buildings in the country . . . we can no      longer afford to heat the outdoors!    </p>    <p>      Put operable portholes in the airtight windows of      heremetically sealed high-rises . . . Con-Ed and other      companies may not own the air, but in tight-as-a-drum      modern buildings, you literally have to pay through the      nose to breathe.'    </p>    <p>      Require new structures be built to last instead of to      crumble or rot. Cut stone, not redwood.    </p>    <p>      Learn from Italy, where folks have lived a long time in      hotter weather than ours without air conditioning. In      winter, put on another sweater instead of burning an      additional barrel of oil.    </p>    <p>      Step up solar and wind energy research and application.      Investigate the process of photosynthesis, and the means by      which chlorophyll converts radiant energy to chemical form.    </p>    <p>      Prohibit utility companies from using smokestack      "scrubbing" systems that jeopardize the health of our      lungs.    </p>    <p>      Terminate the nuclear-energy-from-fission experiment,    </p>    <p>      Establish recycling centers and collection systems in all      cities, and let the manufacturers of waste (and their      captive consumers) subsidize the cost.    </p>    <p>      Initiate a system for honest maintenance of machinery,      appliance, and other equipment. Let auto makers become auto      fixers who solve existing problems, instead of      manufacturing new ones. They could do it at a profit!    </p>    <p>      Clean up America now. A bright and shiny 1976 for all!    </p>  <h3>A FEW FINAL NOTES</h3>     <p>      We're delighted that: MOTHER has asked us to contribute a      regular column to her pages . . . we look forward to a long      a mutually beneficial relationship.
