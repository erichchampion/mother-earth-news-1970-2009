                   <h5 id="byline">   by PATRICIA FORD:    </h5>    <p>      In the summer of 1973-when we found the 8-1/2 acres      of Alaskan bush that would be our home-there was      nothing here but wilderness, stately spruce, aspens, a      beautiful blue-green river running past, and a spectacular      view of the Wrangell Mountains. One year later, we made our      move back to the land.    </p>    <p>      My husband and I had talked and dreamed of the step for      years . . . but like so many others of our generation, we      were caught up in the middle-class suburban way of life      that is spelled T*R*A*P. We bought the usual      "musts"-the washer and dryer, dishwasher, color TV,      all the modern push-button gadgets-and then spent      more money on sports equipment and spa memberships to get      some exercise. Worse still, our children were growing up in      a world that didn't prepare them for what we felt lay      ahead. The oldest was ready to enter junior high school,      and the time had come for us to act . . . or forget the      whole thing and stop talking about it. So we acted: just      jumped in with both feet ("up to our ears" is more like      it).    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, we did have enough sense to realize that we      couldn't make it with a millstone of bills around our      necks. We've known others who tried to swim with such a      load and ended up back in the 9-to-5 grind. So we spent two      years working, saving, scrimping, and buying only those      things that would fit the new lifestyle we were to embark      on. When the washer broke down, we bought two No. 3 laundry      tubs, a hand wringer, and a "stobby stick". . . and I      learned to wash on a rubboard.    </p>    <p>      Even before we began easing ourselves out of the "system",      we knew we loved Alaska and that we wanted to live here.      But where? Not near Anchorage: too many people, and real      estate prices that long ago soared beyond our budget. Then,      in May of 1973, we heard about a state land auction to be      held in early June. The available acreage was in the Copper      River Valley. We'd never been there, but geological survey      charts and maps of the area provided by the state convinced      us that it would be worth the 400-mile-plus round trip to      take a look.    </p>    <p>      After five days of tramping through miles of underbrush and      nearly being carried off by mosquitoes, we felt ready to      give up and search elsewhere. Every piece of property we      looked at was either 1,000 feet above the river, or right      on the highway, or totally inaccessible. (If we couldn't      get in with our 31-year-old four-wheel-drive Jeep, we      didn't want the place.)    </p>    <p>      Then, the day of the auction-tired, discouraged,      grimy, hot, and besmeared with mosquito goop-we      stumbled onto our small piece of the Good Earth. We knew      immediately that it was what we were looking for: a      hillside suitable for building (with only a minimum of      trees to cut down), six acres of meadowland to farm, and      best of all, a breeze blowing down river to keep the      mosquitoes grounded. Needless to say, we bought the      property.    </p>    <p>      In August we came back again, this time for three weeks, to      fell and limb some of our trees and stack them on skids to      season over the winter. We were greener than commercially      picked bananas when we started and more bruised than      overripe ones when we finished . . . but we did it,      nevertheless, with all hands pitching in to help. Even our      nine-year-old hacked off branches with a small bow saw, and      among us we managed to clear a house site and a 30' X 70'      section for the garden.    </p>    <p>      The only really stupid thing we did was leave the bark on      the trees we felled. (The sooner a trunk is peeled after      it's cut, as we now know, the easier the job is to handle.)      To be honest about it, after the sap stops      flowing-about the end of July here-logs don't      "peel" anyway . . . but at least they do "shave" more      readily. We had read that the logs would check (crack) less      if they were felled in the fall and stripped the following      spring. That may be so, but they're a durn sight harder to      work on when they've lain that long. The bark seems to glue      itself to the tree. If we had been here in April and early      May to get started on them, our book learning might have      applied . . . but since we didn't begin until mid-June, we      really had a difficult time of it.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, after our initial three-week stint as lumberjacks      that first fall, it was back to Anchorage . . . no longer      "home" but a place to wait out the winter. We passed the      time learning more about what we planned to do and      collecting a years supply of the food staples and equipment      (tools, etc.) we'd require for the new life we were      stepping into. Our resources were limited, and we wanted      all our building materials paid for and enough of      everything we'd need to last until we were established.      Many lists were made and remade, until our "priority" items      were pared down enough to fit our budget.    </p>    <p>      Construction supplies, in particular, cost us a lot of      serious thought. There are unique building problems here,      where winter temperatures hover at -35° F for many      weeks and occasionally plummet to -70°. We talked to      contractors, to helpful lumberyard personnel, and      especially to my father-carpenter with much      experience in building for Alaska weather      conditions-who was of great assistance in helping u      decide what we absolutely had to have in the way of      insulatio for floors, roof, and windows.    </p>    <p>      We also received some good advice from the Cooperath      Extension Service . . . including the following warning      "Natural logs (trees with the limbs removed) will require      of the builder the highest levels of craftsmanship, the      most expenditure in effort, time, and tools of any of the      possible choices [of building materials]." Nevertheless,      because of the astronomically high price of wood, we      decided to use as much natural timber as possible (more      logs to cut!). The only finished lumber we would buy was      "second grade" 1" X 3" fit flooring and 1" X 6" cedar      siding for the roof. All the rafters purlins, floor joists,      windowsills, doorsills, and jambs we would make from trees      we'd cut, peel, and hew ourselves. Even our windows would      be made from the leftover flooring, with the tongue and      groove cut off to create the moulding that holds the double      panes of glass in place.    </p>    <p>      The total cost of our cabin has run slightly under $3,000 .      . . including fiberglass and styrofoam insulation, glass      for windows, polyethylene (vapor barrier, an absolute      essential in Arctic climates), roll roofing, wood      preservative, nails, spikes, and the lumber we bought. Not      a bad price for a house with more than 1,200 square feet of      floor space!    </p>    <p>      As the target date for moving to our homestead approached,      we were excited and awed at the same time. All around us      were cases and boxes filled with food, tools, equipment to      build a hydraulic ram, a Franklin fireplace, barrel stove,      wood cookstove (which I had absolutely no notion how to      manage), chain saw, log dogs, drawknives, chicken wire      fencing. . . and 20 flats of delicate seedlings,      painstakingly started in our living room, to be      transplanted to the garden. With the help of friends and      relatives we managed to get everything the 225 miles to our      new home.    </p>    <p>      So, we had arrived: with three kids aged 9, 11, and 14, two      very inexperienced lumberjacks, more than three tons of      equipment (most of which we had only a vague idea how to      use), two cats, one dog, and one very high-strung yappy      poodle (didn't I tell you we were middle-class      suburbanites?). And what did we have to come to? A pile of      unpeeled logs in the wilderness, just lying there waiting      for us to put them together into a house.    </p>    <p>      When everybody left that night, total chaos reigned.      Neither of us knew where anything was (except for the tent,      and then only because it's pretty hard to lose something      that size). Fortunately, it stays fight up here nearly all      night by the end of May . . . because I'm sure we couldn't      have found the lantern. The awesomeness of it all washed      over me in a flood of nausea as the last car disappeared      down the rutted road that was now our driveway. "My God," I      muttered, "what have we done!"    </p>    <p>      That thought was to recur many times through the next four      months. . . and every time it hit, our stomach muscles      would tie themselves into knots. Sure we were afraid:      afraid of the bears that roam this part of the country in      abundance, but more afraid that we'd bitten off more than      we could chew. Neither of us had ever built anything      before. I'd never even planted a garden-only flowers, with      a few vegetables tucked between the roses-and we were      counting on the harvest fox winter food.    </p>    <p>      Well, scared or not, we got to work and spent the first      three weeks rototilling, fencing, and planting the garden.      And yes, we ran into some problems. For starters, the      hydraulic ram didn't work (not enough drop in the river to      pump the water the necessary 100 feet up the bluff). We      tried sinking a well by hand, and tore up the sand point      six feet down . . . so we had to spend a mint on a      gasoline-driven pump that will hold us until we have time      to work out a system that is wind-powered.    </p>    <p>      Then the weather! It rained for what seemed like days at a      time. (What am I saying? It was days at a time.) And the      wind, that delightful wind which drove away mosquitoes the      summer before . . . now it blew and blew and BLEW. The      polyethylene covering the caches of equipment flapped and      tore, and things got wet and we dried them. And the house      progressed so slowly! By the end of June we had only the      foundation logs in place.    </p>    <p>      Of course, life wasn't exactly simplified by our sudden      decision to take on more animals than we'd originally      expected to handle that first summer. We'd planned to raise      dairy goats and chickens the following year . . . but      somehow, in mid-June, it seemed like a good idea to buy the      two beautiful Toggenburgs a friend was selling.      Then-as long as we already had goats to care      for-it didn't appear unfeasible to buy the 20 New      Hampshire Red chicks from the feedstore. (Why is it that      such things always seem reasonable only <em>before</em> you      do them?)    </p>    <p>      So the chicks came home to live with us, to grow and      eventually give us fresh eggs. And man, did they ever live      with us! It didn't occur to me until after I'd agreed to      get them that baby chickens needs lots of warmth. What      warmth? We were still living in a tent, we don't have      electricity out here, and it's for sure I couldn't tuck      them inside my shirt . . . so we solved the problem by      letting them roost on a hot water bottle in a cardboard      box.    </p>    <p>      During the first week of the chicken invasion, I got up      every morning at 2 a.m. to do hot water refills. A pot on      the tent heater kept the fresh supply warm until needed,      and the biddies' box was placed next to my sleeping bag for      convenience and extra warnth. (For the record, the      nighttime temperature in mid-June is about 35°.) During      the day we put the chicks outside in their pen to scratch      and run . . . and in the evening we brought them back in.      Then-oh bliss!-at the end of three weeks we      acquired an old rabbit hutch to use as a temporary      chickenhouse and bade adieu to our tentmates. Thanks to a      miracle, all but two survived. I guess what we'd read about      New Hampshire Reds being a sturdy breed must be true.    </p>    <p>      By the middle of July the potatoes were up and smiling at      us and the peas were a foot and a half high . . . and while      the corn wasn't "as high as an elephant's eye", it was      growing and looked beautiful! The Early Tanana tomatoes      (the only kind that can be raised successfully without a      greenhouse in our 90-day growing season) were starting to      blossom. That garden took a lot of my time during the warm      months. It seemed that when I wasn't peeling logs, I was      carrying water for the plants. But it was worth the work.    </p>    <p>      By mid-September-after an eventful summer-the      cabin was habitable. Just 93 days passed between the laying      of the foundation logs and our moving in.    </p>    <p>      The house is bigger than we'd imagined it would be, with a      24' X 32' ground floor and a 24' X 20' sleeping loft that      leaves us an 18-foot-high cathedral ceiling in the living      room/kitchen area. As I write (mid-winter) we're still      putting in the last of the windows and have nearly all the      interior work left to do, but we're snug and warm . . .      even at the -35° we had last week.    </p>    <p>      We're very pleased with what we've accomplished. Many times      we look around and find it difficult to believe that we're      really here and that we really did this. Especially, when I      glance up at that 40-foot ridge beam, I still occasionally      wonder how we got it "way up there". "You really built a      neat-o house," said my four-year-old nephew. Yeah. We think      so too!    </p>    <p>      And we know we've learned a lot in the short time we've      been here. Mainly that whether a family succeeds or fails      in their return to the land depends more on their attitude      than on any other factor. When people are reared in a      materialistic society, it becomes an ingrained habit for      them to think, "I'll buy this, or that, or whatever." But      to make it on a self-sufficient basis you have to retrain      yourself to ask, "Do I really <em>need</em> that? If so,      how can I make it? Or can I devise an alternative?" Success      in this kind of living comes from the belief, "If it can be      done, I can learn how and do it!"    </p>    <p>      Sure, sometimes washing clothes on a rubboard gets to be a      real drag, and I have to remind myself that by doing the      laundry this way I'm able to give each article individual      attention. Then I can feel satisfaction in a job well done.      At times breadmaking becomes a bore . . . but I bear in      mind that I'm personally providing my family with something      they need. So I bake and enjoy the chore. Splitting wood at      -35° isn't much fun either, but it's usually done      cheerfully even by our 10-year-old because we all realize      how interdependent we are for our needs.    </p>    <p>      We each feel we're contributing to the common good,      building something together for all of us. And what better      way is there to teach a child self-awareness and      self-worth?    </p>    <p>      My husband Dick (5'7", 130 pounds) and I (5'3", 120 pounds)      are both small people . . . and-at 37 and      33-we're no longer kids. Yet the two of us, with the      help of three young sons, <em>have</em> carved a beautiful      cabin and working homestead for ourselves out of the tough      Alaskan wilderness. It's been a backbreaking job at times .      . . but we think that the rewards far outweigh the      hardships.    </p>
