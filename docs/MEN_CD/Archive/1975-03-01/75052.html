                    <p>      <strong>SELLING BIRTHRIGHT FOR A MESS OF MONEY?</strong>RJB      Sales Export Inc. of Sequim, Washington has contracted with      the Persian Gulf sheikdoms of Dubai and Bahrain to provide      them with at least 50,000 metric tons of liquefied cow      manure each month for the next three years. American      farmers in 40 states are involved in the operation, and      will get 5$ a gallon for their manure. But how much more      would that manure be worth if it were merely put back into      the U.S. soil from which it comes'?</p>      <p><strong>GLOBAL POPULATION MAY BE EXPLODING FASTER</strong>      than previously realized, according to a study sponsored by      the Environmental Fund. Figures, how world population      growing at a rate of 90 million per year not 75 million, as      was previously thought. In the United States, the Census      Bureau has declared that 5.3 million people were not      counted in 1970. And the population of China formerly said      to be 800 million- was shown to be at least 917 million      people, if not more.</p>      <p>      <strong>NUTRITIONAL YEAST FROM PETROLEUM?</strong> Standard      Oil Company has announced it will open a plant this year to      produce 10 million pounds of yeast (50% protein) annually      to be used as a food source.</p>      <p>      <strong>THE MOST DEADLY SUBSTANCES KNOWN TO MAN</strong> -      plutonium 239 -- is the primary fuel for Liquid Metal Fast      Breeder Reactors and The Natural Resources Defense Council,      Inc., points out that less than an ounce of the material      could conceivably kill everyone in the United States. If      the government's stepped-up LMFBR development program      proceeds as planned. the next 25 years may see us      transporting several hundred thousand pounds of the isotope      by rail, truck, or plane annually.</p>      <p><strong>      THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY PARTY</strong> ain't a weekend      celebration, folks it's a new political organization      dedicated to low energy use. Ecological sanity, economic      stability, personal realization, and the survival of man.      EQP was founded in the belief that conventional politics      offers no hope for survival, change, or even recognition of      impending disaster. Contact David A. Bainbridge, Rt. 1, Box      171, Winters, Calif. 95694 for more information.</p>      <p>      <strong>METHANE IS JUST A LOT OF HORSE MANURE</strong> ,      and Donald Brockman of Neenah. Wisconsin is making good use      of both. Brockman owns and operates a stable of more than      100 horses (which produce about 100 cubic feet of manure      daily) -- is installing a huge methane digester plant on      his Land. The gas will heat his home, a barn, four large      stables, an office, and an indoor riding arena and will      also power electrical generators, That'll mean an annual      savings of 55,000 in utility bills' Brockman also plans to      mix the carbon produced by hiss digester with lime and sell      it as fertilizer, and will raise 250,000 trout fingerlings      on the plant's residue slurry.</p>      <p>      <strong>FREE STERILIZATION AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT</strong>      is being offered by Charles MacArthur, owner of Endacom      Graphics in Connecticut. MacArthur, who had his own      vasectomy performed over 12 years ago, feels that.      Sterilization should be an integral part of corporate      health benefit programs. Another unusual employee reward at      the small graphics company: Any worker who travels to work      by bicycle or other environmentally sound vehicle receives      a half-hour of overtime pay!</p>      <p>      <strong>ANYBODY GONNA SWALLOW THIS HOLE THING?</strong> At      a recent symposium sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey,      Dr, .John D. Ridge, head of the Department of Mineral      Economics at Pennsylvania State University, introduced a      proposal that he said "could conceivably uncover an      estimates! 5750 billion in recoverable raw materials" and      "duplicate in the next 25 years all the growth and demand      for mineral and energy resources of the previous 200      years". His proposal? Sink a network of 7,500      three-mile-deep exploratory drill holes across the nation      one every twenty miles. 'Nuff said.</p>      <p>      <strong>GETTING LAND INTO THE HANDS OF MORE ECOLOGY -      CONSCIOUS_PEOPLE</strong> was just one of the many vital      topics discussed-and acted upon at the Northwest Conference      for Alternative Agriculture in Ellensburg. Washington.      Workshops at the seminar led to the formation of an      information exchange network, a seed bank system, a      food-trading plan, and a rural apprenticeship program. The      conference may prove to be a "blueprint" for other regions      where the need for coordination and cooperation among      ecologically aware people is recognized.

Wash.      98584 for more information.</p>      <p>      <strong>YOGURT CUTS CHOLESTEROL,</strong> according to a      report in the National Enquirer. Tests runt at Vanderbilt      University are said to indicate that there is a substance      its yogurt which reduces cholesterol despite the fact that      the food itself contains a high level of the infamous      substance.</p>      <p>      <strong>REP. JAMES A. BURKE (D-MASSE) HAS AUTHORED A      BILL</strong> which would direct the federal government to      distribute free seeds and plants for use in home gardens      The House Agriculture Committee approved the bill-over the      objections of Chairman Rep. W.R. Page (D--Tex.) and the      Agriculture Department-15 to 9. It's estimated that the      proposed $6 million worth of seeds, if distributed as      planned, would produce between 5380 and $400 million worth      of vegetables each year. Says Burke, "It's the cheapest      form of helping people help themselves that I know      of-"</p>      <p><strong>THE FIRST ANNUAL JUICY TOMATO MEMORIAL      AWARD</strong> was presented recently to Mrs. Jean Farmer      of Bloomington. Indiana. Tile award is bestowed by the      Center for Science in the Public Interest to an individual      or organization making a unique contribution toward      improving the quality of the American diet. Mrs. Farmer (a      housewife and mother of four) was honored for her      successful and almost single efforts to effect a ,trick ban      on "junk" foods in Indiana's Monroe County school      cafeterias.</p>      <p>      <strong>A REPORT ENTITLED "ACID RAIN: A SERIOUS      ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM"</strong> which recently appeared in      Science magazine noted that the annual acidity value of      precipitation in the north eastern United States now      averages about pH 4 and that some individual storms have      been recorded at pH 2.1 (something akin to vinegar). G.E.      Likens and F.H. Bormann, co-authors of the article, point      to increased use of fossil fuels and ironically enough- the      installation of particle-removal devices in industrial      smokestacks as the probable cause.</p>      <p>      <strong>THE FLIGHT OF THE "KILLER" BEES CONTINUES      and</strong> --for the most part-remains unchecked. Costa      Rican officials are understandably alarmed as the steady      northern migration of the now-famous "killer" or "assassin"      bees brings the deadly insects within a year's traveling      distance of that country. The unusually aggressive      cross-breed of African and South American honey bees-all      apparently descendants of a swarm which escaped a Sao      Paulo. Brazil research lab in 1957-attack their victims "en      masse" and are now responsible for the deaths of thousands      of animals and over 300 humans.    </p>
