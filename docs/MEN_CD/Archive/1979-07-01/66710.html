                    <p>      You may be missing out on one of the most versatile      vegetable treats around!    </p>        <h3>      BEATRICE LEVIN		</h3>	  <p>		  The solid, plump, firm-skinned eggplant is      one of the handsomest-and tastiest vegetables available.      Ever since the Moors brought this purple fruit to the      Mediterranean region-sometime during the Middle Ages-folks      in Italy and France (as well as people throughout the      Middle East) have been whipping up delicious eggplant      dishes. Here are a few of my favorites:    </p>    <h3>      EGGPLANT SALAD SUPREME    </h3>    <p>      Broil a good-sized, unpeeled eggplant-under a low flame for      20 to 30 minutes, turning it often. When the vegetable is      soft ... remove its skin (which will slip right off) and      mash the "meat" into a pulp. Add 1-1 /2 tablespoons of      salad oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice . . .      then season the mixture to taste with salt, pepper, garlic      salt, and onion salt. Serve the finished dish cold-on      lettuce leaves-for a salad that's just as delicious as it      is unusual.    </p>    <h3>      HEARTY EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA    </h3>    <p>      Peel 1 large eggplant (or use 2 small ones) and cut the      fruit into 1/2-inch slices. Dip each piece in beaten egg      and then in flour, brown 'em in heated oil, and let the      cooked vegetable drain well on brown paper.    </p>    <p>      When that's done, place a layer of eggplant in a deep      casserole and cover it with tomato sauce. (You'll need      about 2 cups of tomato sauce in all, or you can use a No.      303 can of prepared meatless spaghetti sauce with      mushrooms.) Sprinkle the surface with Parmesan cheese and      "top-layer" it with thinly sliced mozzarella. Repeat this      sequence until all the eggplant is used ... finishing off      with the mozzarella. Bake the parmigiana in a 400 °F      oven for 15 minutes and serve it hot. This exceptionally      tasty treat will satisfy five or six hungry people.    </p>    <h3>      EGGPLANT WITH OYSTERS    </h3>    <p>      Here's a special dish for "special company" . . . which can      be served either as a vegetable or as the main course.    </p>    <p>      Halve a two-pound eggplant lengthwise and scoop out the      center, leaving a wall about 1/2 inch thick. Chop up the      scooped-out sections ... and saute 'em with 1/2 cup of      butter, 1/4 cup of minced onion, 1 clove of minced garlic,      and 2 tablespoons of minced celery ... until the onion is      golden brown.    </p>    <p>      In a separate bowl, combine 1 pint of drained and chopped      oysters, 1 cup of soft bread crumbs, 1 /4 cup of minced      parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon of thyme ... then stir this      combination into the cooked ingredients. Spoon the mixture      into the eggplant shells, place 'em in a buttered heatproof      dish, and bake at 375°F for 30 minutes. These elegant      eggplant "boats" will serve six people.    </p>    <h3>      AUBERGINE CONTINENTAL    </h3>    <p>      This superlative eggplant extravaganza from France is      served cold as an hors d'oeuvre, and-in Italy-is used as an      equally unusual and delicious hot vegetable side dish.    </p>    <p>      First boil or bake an eggplant, and while it's cooking-chop      1 onion, 1 seeded green pepper, and 1 tomato into very fine      pieces. Add 1 thinly sliced zucchini and 1 clove of minced      garlic . . . then heat up 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a      large skillet and sauté the mixture until its      ingredients are limp and tender. When the eggplant is done,      peel it, chop it very fine, and add it to the skillet ...      flavored with 2 tablespoons of red wine, a little oregano,      salt, and pepper. Mix everything well, stir in half a can      of tomato paste, and-finally-simmer the mouthwaterin'      delight for 45 minutes.    </p>    <p>      You can serve this dish hot, or chill the delicacy and      offer it as a dip ... with crackers or potato chips. Either      way, your guests will love it!    </p>    <h3>      EXQUISITE EGGPLANT PROVENÇAL    </h3>    <p>      Wash and peel a firm eggplant, cut it into 1/2-inch slices,      and season the chunks with salt, pepper, and a dash of      paprika. Then sprinkle a mixture of finely chopped parsley,      garlic, and bread crumbs over the vegetable. Place the      slices-with a thin coat of olive oil on top-on a lightly      greased piepan . .. and broil the dish until it's lightly      browned and tender.    </p>    <p>      While the eggplant is cooking, cut a couple of medium-sized      tomatoes in half, season 'em with salt and pepper, and      sprinkle some of the parsley/garlic/bread-crumb mixture on      top. Dot the fruit halves with butter, place 'em on another      lightly greased pie plate or baking pan, and grill 'em      slowly in the oven until lightly browned.    </p>    <p>      When serving, arrange the tomato halves on top of the      eggplant . . . and you'll produce a treat that's handsome      enough to grace any table!    </p>    <h3>      EXTRAORDINARY EGGPLANT MEAT LOAF    </h3>    <p>      And-finally-here's an eggplant tip that turns an ordinary      meat loaf into something special indeed! Simply use your      favorite recipe . . . but alternate layers of the ground      beef mixture with slices of raw eggplant. Bake the loaf for      the usual time .. . then sit back and soak in the rave      reviews!    </p>		<hr />    <p><strong>      EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong> Three of MOTHER'S recipe taster/testers "had      at" Beatrice's eggplant delights with the following      results:    </p>    <p>      Both the Parmiglana and Continental dishes got top ratings,      and the latter was reported to be delicious when added to      pinto beans, too. MS. Levin's Salad Supreme recipe was also      well received . . . although our tester noted that the      color of the finished product was an unappetizing (to some)      "okra" green. (The vegetarians in the crowd loved it, but      several less adventurous folks declined a chance to taste      the dish.) The Provençale was also popular . . .      especially when the eggplant was cooked until tender before      the other ingredients were placed on top. And Beatrice's      Eggplant With Oysters was reported to have a pleasing      poultry-dressing-like texture and a flavor especially      agreeable to seafood fans.    </p>
