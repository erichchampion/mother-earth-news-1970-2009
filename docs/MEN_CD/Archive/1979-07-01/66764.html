                <p>      <strong><em>Jerry Renninger lets us in on the little-known      secrets that experts use to . . .</em></strong>      <strong>KEEP THAT KNIFE SHARP!</strong>    </p>    		<hr />            <p>        <em><strong>A little practice makes for a perfect edge. A    good knife is probably the most important tool you own...so    treat this useful friend with loving care.</strong></em></p>            <p><strong><em>Hold the knife in    your right hand and support the back edge of the blade with    your left. Don't over do it, or you'll produce a " wire    edge".</em></strong></p>		<hr />    <p>      Though hardly a day passes without the need to use knives,      most people know very little about the fine art of keeping      these invaluable tools sharp. However, with the right      materials and a bit of practice, you can-in a short      time-literally earn a reputation for your cutlery's keen,      precise, longlasting edges.    </p>    <p>      Your first-and most important-piece of knife-honin'      equipment is a proper whetstone . . . and "proper" means a      "sharpener" that is a direct product of the earth, not some      factory-fused chunk of abrasive particles. The best of such      tools-mined in the Ozarks from deposits of novaculite are      called Arkansas oilstones, and they sell for anywhere from      $1.00 to $40. For most nonprofessional purposes, the soft      pearl-gray stones are best . . . and you should choose one      that's at least an inch longer than the largest blade you      want to sharpen. ( A good, all-purpose oilstone-measuring      about 1" X 2" X 8"-will probably cost between $10 and $18.      )    </p>    <p>      You may be able to find such a tool by visiting the biggest      sporting goods, or hardware, or gourmet cooking stores in      your area. If you don't have any luck with local outlets,      both Buck Knives, Inc. (Dept. TMEN, Box 1267, El Cajon,      California 92022) and Gerber Legendary Blades ( Dept. TMEN,      1420 S.W. 72nd Street, Portland, Oregon 99223) market fine      oilstones . . . or you can go right to the source and write      to Hiram A. Smith Whetstone. Inc. ( Dept. TMEN, 1500 Sleepy      Valley Road, Hot Springs, Arkansas 71901) or A.G. Russell      Company (Dept. TMEN, 1705 Highway 71 North, Springdale,      Arkansas 72784). Russell, incidentally, also sells both      custom-made and factory knives.    </p>    <h3>      "ROCK" SOLID    </h3>    <p>      Once you've acquired your stone, you'll need to anchor it      to a work surface to keep the tool from skating around      while in use. A C-clamp will serve this purpose, but you'll      be better off if you fashion a permanent "nest" of      nailed-down wood strips in which the whetstone can sit      securely. (Special cast-aluminum troughs, which can be      bolted directly to your workbench, are available      commercially . . . but they tend to be expensive.)    </p>    <p>      If your stone comes packaged in a wooden box, you can      simply cover the bottom of the container with velcro or a      thin sheet of urethane foam to prevent the sharpener from      sliding about. ( I also know of one ingenious soul who sank      two screws into the top of his workbench, sawed off the      heads, and then drilled corresponding shallow holes in the      underside of the box. His anchoring method worked like a      charm!)    </p>    <h3>      OIL IT UP!    </h3>    <p>      An oilstone will, of course, have to be oiled when it's in      use. Some folks use mineral oil, a light machine lubricant      ( like Three-In-One), or even water for this purpose. But      if you want to do the job right, I'd suggest the purchase      of a can of Norton Bear Oil-if you can find it-or Buck or      Gerber Honing Oil. (Personally, I get the best and fastest      results with Buck Oil.) The purpose of these fluids is not      to lubricate, but to float the tiny chips of blade steel up      and away from the stone's surface . . . keeping your honing      tool cleaner and more efficient.    </p>    <p>      When the stone is firmly secured, ladle on at least a full      tablespoon of the oil. Be really generous with the product.      . . because this is one of the few instances in life where      more is better. In fact, if your stones brand-new, it's not      a bad idea to soak the entire sharpener in oil overnight      before you use it. Novaculite is close-grained but as      porous as a sponge . . . and the more oil the rock absorbs,      the better it will work.    </p>    <h3>      ON THE EDGE    </h3>    <p>      Aside from the need for a good atone and oil, there's only      one other "secret" to knife sharpening . . . you must      constantly maintain the proper angle between the stone and      the blade. Here's how to determine that "slant" and keep      it:    </p>    <p>      With a source of strong light positioned directly over your      work surface . . . lay the blade flat across the stone and      slowly turn the handle to lift the back edge. As you do so,      you'll notice that the shadow-cast on the stone by the      tapered cutting edge of the blade-begins to disappear. When      the small strip of shade vanishes, the edge is at the      correct angle. (Though opinions differ, expert knifemakers      say the "slope" should be between 20 and 30 degrees.)    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, maintaining that angle through the entire      sharpening process isn't easy. However, like most manual      skills, you'll get the hang of it after a bit of determined      practice. Just concentrate on keeping the angle . . . check      it frequently against its shadow . . . and you'll acquire      the knack in a relatively short time. ( If the "tilt" of      the blade is varied from one side to the other-or if the      knife is rocked back and forth-you'll make the edge round      rather than acute, and the cutting tool can actually become      duller as a result of your efforts.)    </p>    <p>      Now, hold the knife handle in your right hand and support      the back edge of the blade with the fingers of the left, as      illustrated in the photographs. (You need both hands to      control anything larger than a penknife, which is one      reason why the whetstone must be secured in place.)    </p>    <p>      Starting at the far end of the stone, position the heel of      the blade (the section near the handle) against the surface      . . . determine your angle . . . and firmly draw the      cutting edge toward you as if you were trying to shave off      a layer of stone. At the same time, move your hand to the      right . . . so that the entire length of the blade trails      down and across the honing surface. It's also wise-as you      approach the tip -to raise the handle slightly, to be sure      the curved portion of the knife's point remains in contact      with your sharpening tool. With practice . . . you'll      develop a smooth, sweeping action with every pass.    </p>    <p>      After four or five of these strokes, repeat the process on      the other side of the edge. Depending upon your degree of      ambidexterity, you can either transfer your knife to the      left hand and repeat the steps . . . or keep it in your      right hand and push the blade away from you. But      remember-in the latter case-to push the edge across the      stone . . . don't drag it as if you were stropping an      old-time razor.    </p>    <p>      (Some authorities say you should alternate the sides to be      sharpened after each pass . . . but I usually make five      strokes before I switch over. What's important-of course      -is to make an equal number of sweeps on each side, while      keeping the blade-to-stone angle constant.)    </p>    <p>      As you proceed, stop every now and then to test the knife's      sharpness. Once you get the hang of maintaining the proper      angle, you'll be tempted to see just how sharp you can make      the blade . . . but this is a terrible mistake! Excessive      honing will produce what we call a "wire edge" . . . which      curls over on itself and is extremely weak.    </p>    <p>      If you absolutely must have a straight-razor-sharp blade .      . . buy a black Arkansas oilstone (they're used to sharpen      surgical instruments) to "finish off" your cutlery. But      consider yourself warned! The resulting wickedly fine edge      will dull very rapidly.    </p>    <h3>      FINISHING TOUCHES    </h3>    <p>      When your knife is as sharp as you want it to be, give the      stone another healthy dollop of oil and a wipe with a clean      rag . . . to keep it from caking up with particles. Should      the surface become clogged or glazed, scrub it with an old      toothbrush, a touch of powdered cleanser, and water. If      your stone came boxed, replace the lid as protection      against dirt and nicks. . . which could ruin your      investment.    </p>    <p>      Folks who use knives often may want to touch 'em up-in      between "oilstone sessions" with a sharpening steel.      (Gerber sells these instruments for $14 to $28. )    </p>    <p>      And if holding that blasted constant angle is just too much      for you, Buck Knives sells a device called a "Honemaster"      ($7.00) . . . which clamps on the back of the blade and      rides across the stone with it. This "knife guide" will      hold the angle without fail, if properly attached. Some may      see the tool as a crutch, but I liken it to training wheels      on a bike . . . it can teach you the feel of the proper      angle and help you to eventually work freehand.    </p>    <p>      You'll notice this article is not entitled "Fast and Easy      Steps to Knife Sharpening", because there are no fast and      easy ways to get this essential job done. Sure, you can use      a bench grinder or one of those abominable electric kitchen      sharpeners, but you'll probably burn the steel and destroy      the temper of your favorite cutting implements.    </p>    <p>      All you need to hone a keen edge are a good stone, good      oil, and the patience to go over and over what you've      learned here. If your household runs out of edges, practice      on your friends' kitchen knives ... they'll love you for      it! But practice . . . knife sharpening is an extremely      practical skill to acquire.    </p>
