                            <p>      "Want some excellent-and <em>free</em>-garden mulch?" asks Jackson,      Ohio's George W. Clark. "Then keep your eye on the weather      during haying season. A good rainstorm will probably ruin      any bales that unfortunate farmers leave in their fields.      And chances are that the weather-cursed folks will <em>give</em> the      drenched hay to you . . . just for the effort of hauling it      away."    </p>    <p>      Birds won't snatch all the goodies out of your fruit tree      if you try this arboreal "scarecrow" idea from Steve Phipps      of DeSoto, Missouri.    </p>    <p>      Just drape a toy rubber snake from a likely limb of your      apple, cherry, or whatever... and those flying fruitpickers      will stay far, far away. "It really works!" Steve says.    </p>    <p>      Jan and Gary Worthington have that all-too-common summer      problem: a reservoir that occasionally runs dry. To help      conserve the scarce liquid, the Fayetteville, West      Virginians run their clothes washer on <em>half</em> its normal      supply of water!    </p>    <p>      The Worthingtons set a large washtub on a high platform      next to the mechanical cleaner. Then-right at the end of      each rinse cycle-they stop the washer, unhook the far clamp      on the machine's drain hose, and place the tube's end in      their elevated container. When the machine is turned back      on, the washer promptly pumps the used rinse water into      their tin tub.    </p>    <p>      Then Jan and Gary remove the clean garments, put in the      next set of grubby apparel, and siphon the leftover rinse      water from the tub back into the washer . . . to start      another cycle. This way, each batch of clothes is rinsed in      clean liquid, yet only one machineful of "new" water is      required for each washload!    </p>    <p>      OK folks, we know that your gardens are probably yielding      so much produce that the broccoli needs dinner reservations      ... and your green beans have to wait in line just to get      into the kitchen! So we're going to go out of our way and      share nine-that's right, nine-helpful pieces of      food-storing lore. The first three ideas come from readers      whose shortcuts really help them stock up in bulk:    </p>    <p>      [1] Sheri Bickel of Fayetteville, Arkansas blanches      bushel-basket quantities of greens, corn, or string beans      at one time. She simply throws the food loads in her      dishwasher, sets the machine on scald (don't add detergent,      please!), and lets the hot water cycle of that washer get      her veggies ready for preserving. "They turn out great!"      Sheri says.    </p>    <p>      [2] Think that's something? Well, Sharon Griggs can      cold-pack process three or four canner loads of tomatoes      ... in one pot! This Dowagiac, Michigan native takes one of      those old-fashioned elliptical wash boilers (not a tin      washtub), lines the bottom of the large clothes cleaner      with old towels, sets it over two burners on her stove,      puts in lots of water and filled jars . . . and starts      acookin'!    </p>    <p>      Sharon also freezes huge quantities of edibles-using only a      few store-bought containers-by taking the solidly iced food      blocks out of her soft plastic freezer boxes . . . and      storing all the "cubes" of one kind together in big plastic      bags. She can then reuse the expensive containers over and      over again.    </p>    <p>      [3] It looks like Valerie Hannay of Van Buren, Arkansas has      discovered the perfect storage container for half-quart      food jars: liquor boxes! The cardboard packages that fifths      of booze are shipped in (free for the asking at any alcohol      outlet) have built-in, pint-sized dividers. And if you      place small cardboard squares on top of the "preserves"      stored in the bottom of these handy containers, you can      stack your jars two layers deep! The result: food bottles      that don't get broken, sun-bleached, or dust-covered ...      packed in sturdy boxes you can store anywhere!    </p>    <p>      The next three suggestions should help you "stockpile" your      corn harvest:    </p>    <p>      [1] If you find that cutting all those plump kernels oft      the cob is a slippery task, take a tip from Alyne Lawson      (of Ore City, Texas) and simply stand each shucked ear in      the hole of a stem cakepan while you work. The opening will      hold the cob securely, the pan will catch all the kernels      ... and in no time-with no mess or waste-your corn-cutting      chore will be done.    </p>    <p>      [2] But what if-try as you may-you can't keep pace with      your rapidly ripening maize . . . and some of your sweet      ears get tough and starchy? Freeze the kernels anyway, says      Sharon Griggs (a lady who's loaded with practical lore).      The old gleanings may not have much flavor "straight", but      they'll taste just fine and dandy in soups. Ms. Griggs also      combines a cup of the thawed kernels with an equal amount      of water, one tablespoon of cornstarch, a dash of salt, and      sweetener (to taste) . . . then whizzes the ingredients      together in her blender. The Michigander cooks the mix till      it bubbles ... and eats good-tasting cream-style corn!    </p>    <p>      [3] Peter Burkard gets even more goodies out of his      Sarasota, Florida corn patch: He harvests the tiny leftover      ears that always seem to spring up-too late to be      pollinated-on the bottom of cornstalks. Pete then pickles      the rejected "cornlings" just like cucumbers or okra (or      simply refrigerates a few-in vinegar-for several weeks) and      ends up with tasty little pickled cobs . . . the exact same      treats that sell for outrageous prices in stores.    </p>    <p>      Our last trio of food-storing ideas make up the "don't fit      into a group" group:    </p>    <p>      [1] When you've finally eaten, canned, and frozen more      green beans than you think you'll ever be able to use,      don't rototill the rest of your crop back into the soil.      Instead, take some advice from Coggon, Iowa's Catherine      Klug: Ignore the durn plants! Leave the last rows alone      until the first frost. Then pick, shell, and dry the seeds      inside those overgrown pods! The "shell beans" can be used      in hearty winter soups . . . to take the place of      store-bought navy beans.    </p>    <p>      [2] After Mary Scarola harvested and washed her oregano and      basil, she stuffed her herb bunches into paper bags to wait      until she'd have a chance to hang them up. Well, one thing      led to another (as will happen, you know), and when Mary      finally did open the sacks, the herbs were already dried!      The Warwick, New Yorker just stripped the leaves from the      stems . . . and her crispy seasonings were ready to be      jarred. No fuss, no muss, and no worry about the drying      plants being blown away on a windy day.    </p>    <p>      [3] Lastly, Suzanne Mullins of Charlottesville, Virginia      has contributed the absolute, can't-bebeat, easiest way to      home-can grape juice. Simply measure two cups of whole      stemmed grapes into a sterilized quart jar, add one cup of      sugar (more or less to taste), fill the container with      boiling water, and process it for 10 minutes in a      water-bath canner. Six weeks later, you can strain out the      liquid, dilute this concentrate (by half) with water,      and-presto!-have nearly two quarts of ready-to-drink grape      juice!    </p>    <p>      "Last year, my wife and I were faced with a 1,700-mile move      from Colorado to our new homestead in Etlan, Virginia,"      says Robert Legge. "We didn't want to pull a $200 rented      traiter with our old car, and we sure couldn't afford the      $500 price tag for leasing a truck! So we packed up over 20      parcels (some weighing as much as 60 pounds) and moved by      mail . . . for less than $150!    </p>    <p>      "How'd we do it? By wrapping plenty of duct tape around the      strongest boxes we could find ... mailing the heaviest      parcels possible (five 10-pound boxes cost twice as much to      ship as does one 50-pounder) ... and sending all our      reading matter at that economical 'book rate'. We even took      apart two beautiful tables and mailed them, too!    </p>    <p>      "Anything the two of us couldn't trust to the post office      traveled in our now-spacious car ... and we moved with a      minimum of problems and expense. So if you want to save      money when you relocate, ask your local postmaster for a      price list . . . and let the mail do your movin'!"    </p>    <p>      Have you ever faced the prospect of digging up 500 feet of      buried water pipe to find a leak that could be anywhere      along the line's length? We hope not, but if you      do-someday-have a similar problem, remember this tip from      Jack Tavish Brinton of Leesville, South Carolina . . . and      use geometry (not your shovel) to find the solution! Jack      closed all his taps and shut off his water source for one      night, so that all the water that was uphill of the leak      could drain out of the pipe. He then drew off the liquid      that remained in his line into a cylindrical can, and used      the old high school math formula, V= 3.14r2(volume equals      3.14 times the squared radius times the cylinder's height)      to figure out just how much water he had. Finally, Jack      turned the same equation around (to H =V / 3.14 r2) and      applied it to his long, skinny "cylinder": the pipe. The      hole-hunter had already learned the water's volume, so he      plugged in the line's radius, did some multiplying and      dividing, and found out the missing "height" of his water      line.    </p>    <p>      In Jack's case, the "H" worked out to be 65 feet. Since the      Carolina calculator trusted his figurework, he walked 65      feet up the hill and started digging. Voila! There was the      leak.    </p>		    <p>      In times past, folks have lit torches, swung brooms,      sprayed poisons-and more-to get rid of household wasps, but      Don Whiteside of London, Ontario has come up with the      simplest insect remedy of them all. Don noticed wasps      climbing on a soda can, thought about how much the critters      like sweets . . . and bought a supply of those      old-fashioned, scented flypaper strips you can still find      in some country stores.    </p>    <p>      The clever Canadian then hung three "ribbons" along the      roof ... just a bit upwind of his eaves-dwellers. The next      morning, every single wasp in the vicinity was stuck fast      to the gluey strips. Don dropped the bug-covered papers      into the garbage can ... and hasn't seen a single wasp      since.    </p>    <p>      And now here's some hog lore. We're not talking about how      to deal with mastitis, tail-biting, or "poor keepers".      Node, we figure MOTHERS homesteaders already know their      swine basics, so we're going to offer you five useful-but      unusual - "pigbits".    </p>    <p>      [1] Emily Bunn of Winchester, Ohio knows an easy way to      load uncooperative porkers into that market-bound farm      truck. She simply sets her vehicle and ramp in place real      early (before the sun rises), turns on the light in the      truck's cab . . . and stands back! The pigs climb all over      each other to get to the bright area!    </p>    <p>      [2] Lucinda Dittmar of New Carlisle, Indiana has no trouble      moving a stubborn hog. "Get in front of the animal and      cover its head with a bushel basket," Lucinda says. "Then      simply steer the critter backward!"    </p>    <p>      [3] Lucille Williams' farm neighbors-who market hundreds of      the meaty mammals yearly-avoid a lot of cleaning labor      because they teach their piglets (right from the start) to      leave their manure bits on the paved portion of the adult      swine's barnyard. The Dimondale, Michigan folks simply      quarter the young'uns in stalls with their already obedient      mothers and-at the same times every day-let the sows and      babies exercise in that concrete section of the "big pig"      grounds. The mimicking young'uns soon learn to do their      business out there . . . just like Mom does. Most      important-when the critters are finally weaned and moved      into the communal pigpen-they know to head to that pavement      any time they need to "pay their respects"!    </p>    <p>      [4] Tom McGreevy of Richland, Washington makes      land-clearing farmhands out of his porkers by applying the      formula: hogs + corn = stump removal. Tom simply drives      stake holes around unwanted tree bases, plugs the openings      with kernel-laden cobs . . . and his hungry swine burrow      those tenacious stumps right out of the ground!    </p>    <p>      [5] And-even if you've always known how to train, load,      steer, and clear ground with pigs-we'll bet you never      thought of using the "bacon bearers" to seal a new pond      that won't hold water. Eina Myrle has. This Jeffersonville,      Indianan simply fences her snout-faced livestock in the      leaky area so that their active tromping will press down      all the loose mud. Eventually, the swim hole's center      begins to harden, the water level rises, and the animals      are forced farther and farther out . . . packing the pond's      ever-widening edge all the while. Before long, the fish      home's bottom is pressed solid. . . and all ready for rain      to do the rest.    </p>    <p>      Here are some inexpensive natural cosmetics . .. suggested      by Amy and Tom Walinski of Berlin, Maryland: Castile soap      serves as shampoo, body soap, and dentifrice. (Baking soda      is also a good-but more abrasive-tooth cleaner.) Olive oil      makes an excellent skin and hair conditioner . . . and can      be scented as you like. Rubbing alcohol and baking soda      both make effective body deodorants, while whole cloves can      be used as pleasant and long-lasting breath fresheners.      (Just crumble the "ball" ends off and hold the "spice      sticks" in your mouth.)    </p>		    <p>      You can make a mighty fine-looking, inexpensive infant's      shirt or dress ... using ordinary bandanas! Carla Butterton      of Tenino, Washington says these simple sewing projects are      as easy as finding seeds in a watermelon.    </p>    <p>      To make a young'un's shirt, take one large, farm-sized      hanky and fold it in half .. . with the material's      patterned side inside. Cut a curving, "baby-sized"      waist-to-undersleeve line on each side (through both      thicknesses of cloth) and snip a semicircular neck opening      through the middle fold (add a vertical slit in front,      too). Then sew up those sides-and-underarm seams, trim the      material outside this stitchwork, and cover your rough      edges (here and around the neck) with bias tape. Turn the      garment right side out . . add some buttons, snaps, or ties      to close the front of the shirt . . . and you're done!    </p>    <p>      The dress pattern requires two bandanas . . . one for the      front side. and the other for the back.    </p>    <p>      Begin by making a casing along the top of each cloth piece      by folding the fabric down twice (toward the undecorated      side): The first crease should turn under 1/4 inch and the      second 1/2 inch. Stitch close to the edge of this cloth      "tunnel" of material and use a safety pin leader to help      you run a ribbon through each casing.    </p>    <p>      After that, place the two bandanas together (right sides      in) and stitch a little more than halfway up the sides      (stopping where the armholes will be). Trim and bias-tape      these seams, then turn the finished dress right side out.      Put this pretty garment on your child, pull your top      ribbons-to gather material at the neck-and tie a big bow on      each shoulder!    </p>    <p>      "Why heck," adds Carla, "you'll probably like the      children's finery so much that you'll round up some larger      fabric, do a bit of extra hemming, and make clothes for Ma      and Pa, too!"    </p>    <p>      It's bug-picking season, so a lot of conscientious      gardeners will be pouring kerosene into old tomato cans and      dropping in all the Japanese beetles, bean weevils, potato      bugs, cucumber beetles . . . and other assorted nasties      that they can get their mitts on. But at least one backyard      grower-Charles Rice of Highland, New York-will carry a bit      of salad oil in his bug can instead of the traditional      kerosene.    </p>    <p>      And "why fer"? Well, partly because the cooking liquid will      immobilize hungry veggivores as well as lamplighting fluid      does. Better yet, though-when Chuck's task is      finished-he'll have super-protein-rich hors d'oeuvres to      feed to his chickens!    </p>    <p>      Frank H. Ford likes to work on cars, so he collects a lot      of the real "true grit" . . . gummy auto grease. But this      San Jose, Costa Rican scrubs the grime off easily with his      own homemade mechanic's soap. Frank whips up this wonder      worker by mixing 1 part powdered household cleaner with 2      parts sawdust.    </p>    <p>      OK. Now it's YOUR turn! We've all come up with some      practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems that bug us every day. Let's      hear YOUR best "horse sense"ideas so we can share'em and      all benefit.    </p>    <p>      Send your pointers to Down-Home Country Lore, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739, and I'll make sure      that the most useful of the suggestions will appear in      upcoming editions. A one-year subscription-or a one year      extension of an existing subscriptionwill then be sent to      each contributor whose tip does get printed in this      column.-MOTHER.    </p>
