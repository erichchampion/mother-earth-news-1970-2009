                <p>      Try this practical, easy, moneysaving, sew-your-own      project:    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by THERESA YOUNG    </h5>        <p>      Let's face it: Not only are facial tissues ecologically and      economically unsound, but they also have a way of going to      pieces . . . when they're most needed. Have you, for      example, ever tried to mop your gardening-besweated brow      with disposable paper? I have . . . and decided then and      there that it was time to get back to good, old-fashioned,      durable pocket handkerchiefs!<br />      <br />      I wasn't ready, however, to pay 75 cents for a tiny square      of cotton! Especially when I knew I could make five or more      "hankies" for that price . . . or possibly for nothing at      all! Here's how:    </p>        <p>      Almost every sewing machine comes with a book of      instructions and a number of complicated-looking      attachments that many people never bother to master. The      enterprising seamster or seamstress need not be fooled,      however, because machine-stitching paraphernalia-for the      most part-only appears complicated.    </p>        <p>      Let's examine just one of the gadgets usually found with      zigzag, straight-stitch, and even treadle "sewers": the      roll foot. (Its purpose is to curl over and then tack down      edges of fabric to prevent fraying.) Admittedly, you'll      have to practice before you get the hang of this handy      device, but find some scraps of material and try it out . .      . because a roll foot can help you turn out some really      nifty "nose-blowers" in a very short period of time.<br />      <br />      Once you've mastered the attachment (it won't take long!),      look over your odds and ends of cloth and/or any old flour      sacks you could recycle. (Nobody says handkerchiefs have to      be made out of delicate white cotton or linen!) If your      remnants don't look as if they'll do the job, go out and      buy two yards of inexpensive 54" cotton fabric. You can cut      12 big handkerchiefs from that piece . . . each one will be      about 18" X 18", minus the rolled hem (which takes about a      tenth of an inch on each side).<br />      <br />      And-when you already know the rollfoot technique-why stop      with the big brow-moppers? You can produce colorful      neckerchiefs and scarves in the same fashion . . . or even      smaller, appropriately decorated hankies for your favorite      child.<br />      <br />      As another roll-foot project, take a look at your kitchen      budget and note the hunk of money usually spent on paper      products. You can take down the paper-towel rack      permanently if you turn under the edges of highly absorbent      cotton material to produce kitchen cleanup cloths. And why      not be done with those tree-eating paper napkins? Make your      own-plus tablecloths to match- from the fabric of your      choice. You can also adorn bedrooms . . . with      color-coordinated dresser scarves and curtains!<br />      <br />      And don't forget that all the things you sew for yourself      can be used as marvelously practical gifts for others as      well. Wouldn't it be nice if-the next time your friends'      noses produce great, tissues-hattering sneezes they could      whip out their huge, homemade, fabric pocket handkerchiefs      ... and (no doubt) bless you!    </p>
