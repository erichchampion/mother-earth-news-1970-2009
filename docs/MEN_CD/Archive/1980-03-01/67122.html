                <h5 id="byline">      by Earle E. Morris, Jr. Alcohol    </h5>    <p>      <strong>The Earle E. Morris, Jr. Alcohol anti Drug      Addiction Center's new sun-heated greenhouse provides . .      a</strong>    </p>            <p>      Now that folks everywhere are discovering-and utilizing-the      advantages of solar power, it's not unusual to find the sun      being used to heat everything from doghouses to office      buildings. Even the South Carolina Department of Mental      Health got into the act last year, when it installed a      solar collection system at one of its agencies . . . the      Earle E. Morris, Jr. Alcohol and Drug Addiction Center in      Columbia, South Carolina.    </p>    <p>      A three-year-old greenhouse at the Morris Village was      converted-in January 1979-from No. 2 fuel oil to solar      heat, as a demonstration project designed to reduce energy      costs. The active system, which was built in only two weeks      at an initial expense of $3,000, has proved to be more      cost-effective (and more dependable) than the oil furnace      that was used previously.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, exact figures aren't yet available for the      savings in fuel expense over the structure's first full      winter of "going solar". But an administrator reports that,      between the new system's installation on January 15 and      April 1, the greenhouse used "no oil of any consequence".    </p>    <p>      And, although the folks at Morris Village need their solar      system mainly during the winter months, they're planning to      modify it to obtain summer energy savings as well. Soon,      two nearby residence cottages will have the water in their      120gallon heater tanks prewarmed by energy captured in the      solar collection panels.    </p>    <p>      The facility's standard Quonset-shaped greenhouse-which is      30 feet wide and 64 feet long, and consists of two layers      of 4-mil plastic "skin" stretched over an aluminum      frame-was retrofitted by setting up ten solar collectors,      behind a ground cover, at a point eight feet away from the      greenhouse. The huge plates were then connected to two heat      exchangers (mounted in the top of the building), which      transfer the accumulated heat to a 550gallon insulated      water tank located inside the solarium.    </p>    <p>      The greenhouse itself operates as part of a three-fold      therapy program for residents of the intensive care      treatment facility. Activities Director Barrett Patterson      tells us that the addiction center's inhabitants-who range      in age from 13 to 70 years-usually contract for a stay of      eight to 10 weeks ... which includes a full schedule of      group, recreational, and occupational therapy.    </p>             <p>      Work in the greenhouse-growing vegetables as well as      flowers for Morris Village's landscaping-is a primary      activity in the occupational therapy program. Furthermore,      since many of the residents come from rural areas, they can      return to their "agrarian roots" by participating in the      horticultural activities. So the basic reconstructive goals      of the Morris Addiction Center are realized ... with a      little help from an operative solar greenhouse.    </p>

The entire project's cost was $3,000 . . . and since its conversion, the 30' X 64' structure has used almost no fuel oil.
