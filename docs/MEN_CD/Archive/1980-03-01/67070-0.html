        CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT: Even though the Shah-I-Zinda?a series of mosques and tombs in Soviet Asia ? is now a museum, many people (like the ones seen here) still make holy pilgrimages to the spot. The women in this group carried all the possessions, leaving the men unburdened .... Mamadaviti (Father David) Chapel overlooks the friendly city of Tbilisi .... An old cart with modern tires is a proper symbol for China today .... The Great Wall of China is spectacular, and so is the view from the top! . . . The golden domes and spires of the Kremlin, the heart of the Soviet empire, as seen from the Moskva River .... These Soviet Asian girls await their turn to try out for a folk song and dance festival .... Old men in Samarkand here delighted to rneet Americans.
