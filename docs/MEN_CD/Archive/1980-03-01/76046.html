        <p>In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughtsregarding one of mankind's better ideas-barter-and offered up aninteresting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature onbarter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHERcould even swap subscriptions for contributions to thedepartment." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced ourstill standing offer: Anyone (and that means you!) who sends us ashort (200 words or less) account of an actual barter that's goodenough to print will receive-as the folks on the following pagehave-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of same) to THE<span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).</p><p><strong>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, Inc., P.O. Box 70,Hendersonville, N.C. 28739</strong></p><p>I've learned plenty about swappin' since moving to the Ozarksa year ago. For one thing, a person can meet lots of interestingfolks when he or she barters . . . and there's just no beatingthat good feeling that comes from doing a little neighborlytradin'.</p><p>For instance, since the piece of hillside I now call "home"includes a number of densely wooded acres, lots of time getsspent with chain saw and Stickler, clearing the land andsplitting the trees into firewood . . . and that oak timber is<em>ideal</em> for tradin'! So when I needed aerial photographsin order to design the plans for a proposed road, I paid a visitto the manager of the local photo shop (who was rumored to be anavid amateur pilot as well). A little dickering, and-before Iknew it-we were cruising at 1,000 feet with shutters snapping!Several days later, while I studied the up-to-date lofty shots,the moonlighting aviator was basking in front of a cracklingfire.</p><p>Before long I'll be burning some of that sliced oak myself:Because, no sooner had I spotted an ad for a used Franklin stovethan I found myself swappin' again. The owner of the oldwoodburner had purchased a more recent, airtight model . . . andhe was more than willing to exchange his black-bellied cooker fora cord or two of wood.</p><p>Now . . . if I can just find someone with some insulatedstovepipe that he or she'd like to trade . . . .<br />R.G.<br />Arkansas</p><p>Trying to employ MOTHER-type principles particularly theage-old practice of swapping. While living in the city can bedownright difficult at times. Consequently, when two good friendsof mine moved to the country, I enviously bid the newhomesteaders goodbye . . . not realizing that <em>their</em>switch to greener parts would bring a little of "the good life"back to my urban confines.</p><p>Our trading arrangement came about when I first visited theirfarmstead over a year ago. While relaxing in the mountainstillness I lamented the fact that-in my rat-racecommunity-firewood was expensive, food prices outrageous, andpersonal services almost impossible to come by. My ruralcompanions, in turn, complained that their jaunt to town once amonth was costly in gas . . . not to mention that a whole day'slabor was sacrificed for the eight-hour trip. After a littledickering, we worked out a swap that profits everyoneinvolved!</p><p>Now, before I leave my citified life style for a sojourn inthe peaceful countryside - a move which occurs every four weeksor so-I shop for staple goods, pick up store-bought items (suchas gifts, tools, or clothes), and make any needed phone calls (tosave the toll charge) for my rural friends. In short, I do forthem whatever <em>they</em> used to do in town. And, in return, Icome home from my monthly visits laden with firewood, home-bakedbread, jams, jellies, and canned goods galore . . . andoccasionally a handknit sweater or two!</p><p>Our swap-begun over a year ago is still continuing. Myback-to-the-land friends have saved gas and time, while I'vegained a warm hearth and a full belly.<br />J.E.<br />New York</p><p>Ten years ago my husband and I established a newlifestyle-based on barter while living on a sailboat in Greece.Our main swap during the time was to trade packets of vegetableseeds (sent to us from Oregon and France) to gardening landlubberfriends . . . in exchange for a partial share of the resultingedibles.</p><p>Then, after we eventually traded our homemade boat for agenerous plot of rich land with a hand-built cottage on it-wedeveloped a thriving greenery of our own . . . and now swap<em>our</em> fresh produce for fish and needed food staples.</p><p>We've spread the spirit of barter in our new home, too. Eachyear my husband paints oil portraits of a neighboring shepherd'schildren (the family lives in the nearby mountains), and we arerewarded with sheep dung for our olive and fruit trees . . . aswell as thick natural wool for my loom!</p><p>G.J.<br />Volos, Greece</p><p>Although this trade may not <em>surpass</em> swappin' for afree homestead in Chichicastenango, Guatemala (a trade whichcaught my eye in MOTHER NO. 59), it shows how barter can invadeeven drab, corporate-run factory life . . . albeit in a smallway.</p><p>I work the night shift-and have for the past 20 years-in aplant where many of the employees rent working clothes to protectour street garb from the oily, grimy, and generallytough-on-clothing conditions in the mill. The weekly expense is areal strain on many of my buddies' budgets . . . but-thanks totradin' -I save my duds and my paycheck!</p><p>In exchange for collecting the once-a-week garment rental feefrom my co-la borers (the delivery driver who usually makes suchcollections naturally prefers to keep daylight hours), I get mycoveralls free! Now I'm shielded from the grime and a good bitricher as well, and my parcel-pushing friend catches a littlemore shut-eye.</p><p>My swap just goes to show that you can practice old-fashionedbartering "between the (assembly) lines" . . . even in amoney-oriented environment!</p><p>F.L.<br />Michigan</p><p>I've been bartering for years! But my best trade yet has beenwith an elderly lady in my neighborhood. Our swap: I bakehomemade goodies for her, do sim ple chores around the house, andoffer my time and companionship . . . in re turn she gives meitems which she no longer wants. As a result, I've acquiredeverything needed for home food preser vation, from a pressurecooker and cold packer to a meat grinder and food mill . . .including over 100 canning jars!</p><p>In addition, this same deal has earned me a portable gasolinegenerator and a bundle of 1920 teachers' manuals (full of"up-to-date" ideas). My most valuable "pay", however, is thewealth of advice about old-timey methods of. living the simplelife that my neighbor has imparted to me . . . as well as thefriendship that has evolved between us.</p><p>I soon hope to be swappin' chores with more elderly folks inmy community, because I'm just discovering what a vast andvanishing resource such people are. Years of know-how can beacquired by just caring a little. Now that's what I call a rightdecent swap!</p><p>T.J.M.<br />California</p><p>After the home birth of our first child, I not only had toadjust to the unfamiliar role of proud parent . . . but also to awhopping $450 prenatal care and deliv ery bill! Over the next twoyears-while the initial balance had shrunk by only $100-ourfamily (and the debt) had g rown again.</p><p>Feeling the weight of my obligation but lacking the sorelyneeded funds, I hesitantly proposed a swap to our obstetrician: Ihad noticed that she owned a real clunker of a car . . . so Ioffered to apply my considerable mechanical skill to try to fixit. The physician's initial response to the plan-"Well, if youmust"was less than encouraging. But after thinking it over thenext time she had to drive that vehicle, she headed right to theparts store!</p><p>Since the day our swap was made, I've rescued the doctor onthe road several times and successfully overhauled her car'sautomatic transmission (a job I'd never even attempted before!).Now, the doe's runabout isn't a lemon by anyone's standards . . .and we have agreed that I am her personal, on-call mechanic foras long as she's the family physician. If it weren't for MOTHER,I'd never have thought of offering a tune-up in exchange for twoyoung 'uns!!</p><p>P.K.<br />Missouri</p>
