                <p>      Jack McQuarrie reminds us that there are still inexpensive      cures for fishin' fever.    </p>                            <p>      There're no two ways about it . . . a store-bought fish      dinner just can't match the flavorful goodness of a meal of      piscatorial delicacies that you've caught yourself.      Unfortunately, though, the sport of angling-like many forms      of recreation -has been inflated and complicated to the      point where anyone who buys enough gear to be considered      well-equipped will also likely be well on his or her way to      bankruptcy.    </p>    <p>      Worse yet, folks who do their fishing in salt water seem to      bear an even <em>heavier</em> financial burden than do      freshwater anglers. Big, high-powered boats, sophisticated      fish-finding sonar sets, and jewel-bearinged reels often      raise the effective per-pound price of the ocean      fisherperson's catch to somewhere near that of pure gold!    </p>    <p>      There's a way to beat the high cost of snaring yourself a      finny dinner, however. All you have to do is put aside      complication-for complication's-sake and join the      leisurely, happy-and <em>productive world</em> of the pier      angler!    </p>    <p>      While in some eastern coastal states the pier fisherman or      -woman may be required to purchase a fishing license and      even shell out a dollar or two in order to obtain      admittance to a promising dock or jetty (neither expense is      likely to apply to folks fishing from public wharfs along      most parts of the West Coast), pier fishing      <em>equipment</em> can be just about as inexpensive as you      want to make it. In fact, whatever tackle you happen to      have in your garage-or even a simple handline made up of      nothing more than cord, hook, bait, and sinker will do the      job (make sure that your line is 20pound test or more,      though, because there are likely to be a few "big'uns"      lurking around your favorite pier).    </p>    <p>      The simplicity of most pier fishing gear doesn't mean that      this back-to-basics angling won't fill your stringer,      either. In fact, while folks who pursue salmon (a species      which is a good example of "glamour" game fish) only      average <em>one-half fish</em> per outing-according to      fisheries statisticians-pier anglers (who regularly tie      into such tasty bottomfish as cod, flounder, bass, or      perch) average <em>2.44 fish</em> every time they spend a      day fishing! And as long as you don't mind the weather, or      can dress to offset it, pier fishing is good all year      round!    </p>    <p>      Several factors contribute to the good success ratio      enjoyed by wharf anglers. For one thing, the shade provided      by the large docks attracts fish . . . as the critters have      no eyelids and like to get out of the sunlight on bright      days. Then, too since most pier anglers clean their fish on      the spot and return the innards to the ocean the water      around such wharfs is rich in food.    </p>    <p>      And, though catches of bottomfish are common, a pier angler      never knows just <em>what</em> might grab hold of his or      her bait next! Large game fish often cruise such locations      in search of the smaller species that congregate around the      pilings, for instance, and the lucky angler can sometimes      land a trophy that would put many of the fish caught on      budget-breaking charter boat expeditions to shame!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PIER GROUP PLEASURE</strong>    </p>    <p>      The catch isn't everything, though, because piers are also      wonderful places just to relax with your fishing rod and      shed your everyday concerns. The atmosphere is usually a      social one, and you'll find that most wharf anglers are      gregarious sorts . . . always ready to share a net and a      helping hand, a bit of "special" bait, and probably a      little advice and instruction.    </p>    <p>      Many public piers also feature bait and tackle shops . . .      where an angler who chooses to do so can-for a few dollars      rent all the equipment he or she will need. If, however,      you decide to purchase your own pier fishing outfit, the      following guidelines will help you make sure that your      choice of tackle is right for the job:    </p>    <p>      The best rod for pier angling is long (from 61/2 to 10      feet), flexible enough to cast well, and <em>sturdy</em>      enough to discourage a lunker that's dead set on wrapping      your line around a piling. Either a conventional casting or      a spinning reel will work well . . . as long as it's wound      with strong line (again, at least 20-pound test).    </p>    <p>      Most pier "pros" keep their bait in plastic buckets, and      use a gunnysack (or a cooler) to haul their loot home.      Another handy accessory is a drop net or gaff attached to a      rope that will reach from the pier to a foot or so below      the water level . . . to winch up any line-busting monsters      you might catch.    </p>    <p>      The well-equipped pier angler will also carry a half-dozen      sinkers (in weights ranging from two to six ounces), a      variety of hooks, a pocketknife, a club to kill (quickly      and humanely) his or her catch, a rag, and a pair of      long-nosed pliers to remove hooks from the jaws of      sharp-toothed species.    </p>    <p>      And, while you <em>can</em> buy bait at most piers, the      savvy angler will find all the fish-enticing morsels he or      she needs by simply foraging the beach at low tide. In      fact, if I had to choose one all-around pier-fish lure, I      wouldn't hesitate a minute before naming easily gathered      pile worms. The critters can be found in mussel beds (or in      the mud and gravel area between low and high tide lines).      Besides holding a fatal fascination for <em>most</em> kinds      of fish, pile worms (unlike the garden variety) have very      tough skins . . . and it takes a fair bit of time for a      "nibbler" to clean one off your hook.    </p>        <p>      Small mussels make good bait, too. Just remove 'em from the      shell, turn the meat inside out (so the juices can "milk"      into the water), and place it on your hook. Clams will also      bring in the fish . . . especially if the bivalves are used      while they're fresh. It's best to bait up with pieces of      the "neck" or other tough portions of meat, though, to be      sure your lure will stay on the hook long enough to attract      a finny prize.    </p>    <p>      Of course, on the days when you want to concentrate on      tryin' to tie into one of the big cod that often lurk      around piers, you'll need an enticement that's more      <em>substantial</em> than any worm, mussel, or clam. For      such lunkers I use a number 3-0 hook and a whole herring      for bait . . . fished on-or just a <em>bit</em> above-the      ocean bottom.    </p>    <p>      Jigs and spoons will also tempt the big'uns if you simply      lower the artificial lures to the bottom and then bounce      'em up and down. There's no need to <em>buy</em> a jig,      either . . . just take a three-inch length of "pencil lead"      sinker, bend it into a loose S-shape, and crimp its ends to      your line just above the hook. The jury-rigged lure will      work as well as any attracter that can be bought for      $5.00-plus in a sporting goods store.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM PIER TO PLATTER</strong>    </p>    <p>      No matter how successful your day's fishing might be, the      catch won't cook up as tasty as it ought to if you don't      give it proper care. Fish should be cleaned as soon as      <em>possible-before you</em> head for home-if they're to      taste their delectable best. Many pier fisherfolk do their      cleaning on the spot, and store the fish-with ice in a      cooler or burlap sack. Should you want to wait until the      day's angling is over and do all your cleaning at once,      simply wrap your catches as you reel 'em in-in damp      newspaper . . . and set the packaged fish in a shady spot      on the pier until you're ready to do the job.    </p>    <p>      And-although some of the critters that you'll haul up from      the deep won't look too tempting most fish that are caught      from piers are every bit as nutritious and palate-pleasing      as are the better-known game fish. In fact, many seafood      fanciers <em>prefer</em> the flavor of bottomfish to that      of "sport" species.    </p>    <p>      A cabezon, for example, isn't much to look at (as you can      see in the accompanying photo). Even after the fish has      been gutted and filleted, the raw meat has a decidedly      unappetizing green color. The strange hue disappears when      the meat is cooked, however, and the resulting delectable      fillets are flaky, white, and similar to catfish in flavor.    </p>    <p>      Should you need advice on how to prepare your haul, you'll      likely find your fellow pier fishers to be a treasurehouse      of information. You can also consult a seafood cookbook (      if you don't own such a volume, your local library is sure      to have several good ones on hand). And whether you serve      your catch simply broiled with butter and lemon, or use it      as the basis for a complicated gourmet masterpiece-the      memories of your day of fun and companionship on the pier      will add to the flavor of every bite!    </p>
