        <p><em>In 1976, Tom Ferguson - then a fourth-year medicalstudent at Yale - launched a magazine called MedicalSelf-Care . . . which - he hoped - would serve as "aWhole Earth Catalog of the best medical books, tools, andresources".</em></p><p><em>Tom spoke of his plans for the publication</em> -<em>and of his conviction that self-care could raise the generallevel of health in this country and lower our inflated levels ofmedical spending</em> - <em>in the Plowboy Interview inMOTHER NO. 51 . . . and left no doubt that he would work towardmaking those "dreams"come true.</em></p><p><em>Well, Tom Ferguson is Doctor Ferguson now, and the medicalself-care "movement"</em> - <em>as well as Tom'smagazine</em> - <em>has flourished. People are beginning toassume more responsibility for their own well-being and are eagerfor information that will help them take better care of theirbodies.</em></p><p><em>So</em> - <em>in an effort to provide just such verynecessary data</em> - <em>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>' offers asa regular feature a piece by Tom Ferguson, M.D., entitled (whatelse?) "Medical Self-Care".</em></p><p><strong>MEDICAL SELF-CARE</strong></p><p>This month's column is about the role of drugs in self-care,and contains the first part of an interview I had with JoeGraedon. Joe's a pharmacologist, the author of The People'sPharmacy (available for $4.95 from Avon Books, 959 Eighth Avenue,New York, New York 10019), which is the book for folks who wantto improve their understanding of prescription andnonprescription drugs. He also serves as a consultant to theFederal Trade Commission, does a bi-weekly radio show forNational Public Radio, and is on the staff of Medical Self-Caremagazine. What follows is an edited version of ourconversation.</p><p>** ** ** ** **</p><p><strong>FERGUSON:</strong> What is the most important fact toknow about drugs?</p><p><strong>GRAEDON:</strong> First and foremost, don't ever focusyour treatment efforts exclusively on such substances. If youhave an ailment, first try to understand the problem, its causes,and its symptoms. Learn what's going on with your body and how itrelates to the rest of your life. Then you can consider ways oftreatment . . . with a pharmaceutical product being just onepossible way of dealing with the ailment.</p><p><strong>FERGUSON:</strong> What should you ask your doctorwhen he or she prescribes a drug?</p><p><strong>GRAEDON:</strong> Anytime you're considering takingmedication, you've got to weigh the potential benefits againstthe potential drawbacks. So you should learn right off whetherthe drug you may take is intended to give purely symptomaticrelief - which will not lead to a cure - or willactually help your body remedy its underlying ailment.</p><p>You should also find out about the medicine's common sideeffects, serious or not . . . about all possible druginteractions with other substances . . . and about any dangerousreactions the remedy has been known to cause, no matter howinfrequently such repercussions may occur. Be sure, as well, thatyou know what the early warning signs for the serious sideeffects are.</p><p>Don't neglect to learn the name of the drug, either . . . thatsimple but vital fact is frequently not provided to the consumer.And I'm talking about the generic term . . . not just the brandname. In fact, if you're going to be taking a combination remedy,write down every ingredient in the medicine and-if you can-obtain from your doctor an information sheet about each ofthem.</p><p>Lastly, make certain that you under stand precisely how toadminister the drug - "before meals" is not a very specifictime guide, for instance - and the reasons for theinstructions.</p><p><strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Are there any completely safedrugs?</p><p><strong>GRAEDON:</strong> No, indeed. There are potentialproblems with all pharmaceuticals. Often, though, doctors andclients risk being lulled into thinking that particularmedications are completely harmless . . . so let your doctor knowabout any side effects you experience from a drug, no matter howminor the reaction. Otherwise, the physician might not think towarn the next patient to whom he or she gives the medication.</p><p><strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Why do most people rely so heavilyon drugs for treatment?</p><p><strong>GRAEDON:</strong> I think there are four main reasonsfor that dependency. One cause is the vast number ofadvertisements for over-the-counter drugs. Just count the numberof medication-oriented ads you see on television in one week!Children are bound to grow up thinking that such potions are theanswer to all health problems.</p><p>The second cause for our culture's drug reliance is the evenmore intense advertising efforts drug manufacturers make topromote their products to doctors. Pharmaceutical companies havethousands of employees whose sole job is to go to physicians'offices and "push" their drugs. Not only that, but almost everymedical journal contains dozens of very expensive medicationcommercials. Such a sales blitz can't help having a very bigimpact on doctors' treatment tendencies.</p><p>Thirdly, health workers are educated to believe that "there'sa pill for every ill". Prevention and non-drug-orientedtreatments are too often either ignored or given only lipservice.</p><p>And finally, the time pressure involved in clinical visitsencourages drug therapy. The average doctor has perhaps 10 or 15minutes to see each client. That's not enough time to think aboutprevention . . . or even begin to ask how the current problemmight relate to the rest of an ailing person's life. In fact, 15minutes is barely enough time to take a brief history, check theindividual's blood pressure, and then write a prescription.</p><p><strong>FERGUSON:</strong> A lot of people would feel cheatedif they got advice instead of medication.</p><p><strong>GRAEDON:</strong> Absolutely. Many of the pressuresfor drug use come from the client. We live in an "instant"society today, and - when folks are ill - they expectinstant relief. Besides that, the doctors who are charging you$50 for a 15-minute visit aren't likely to recommend anonprescription treatment like aspirin, even if that commonmedication happens to be the best and safest remedy for theillness . . . people will feel that they could have done thatmuch for themselves.</p><p><strong>FERGUSON:</strong> How can we break such patterns?</p><p><strong>GRAEDON:</strong> People have to learn some basicclinical medicine for themselves . . . health workers need tostep out of their authority roles a bit and share their ownuncertainties and doubts . . . and medical education needs tostress non-drug treatment.</p><p>Right now, if someone comes into a physician's office withhigh blood pressure, the doctor's first thought will usually beto prescribe a thiazide diuretic . . . but a more appropriateinitial step might be to recommend that the person lose weight,begin exercising, quit smoking, cut down on salt intake, learnnew ways of dealing with stress, or apply a useful combination ofthese self-care approaches.</p><p><strong>FERGUSON:</strong> What are some good self-health-caretools that are available in drugstores?</p><p><strong>GRAEDON:</strong> One very good tool is the dipstickpacket you can use to test your own urine. It provides a numberof easy, inexpensive, and completely safe screening tests forexcess sugar, blood, or protein in the urine.</p><p>Another new kit allows you to test your own stool specimen fortraces of blood. Persons over 40 should take such an examinationonce a year: All they have to do is touch the fecal sample to apiece of moistened test paper . . . the strip changes color ifblood is present.</p><p>And I highly recommend blood pressure cuffs for home use.Having your own tester is very helpful if you have high bloodpressure and are working at controlling it on a self-help basis.The cuff provides a kind of biofeedback.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Part II of the Joe Graedon interview,covering the drugs that should be kept on hand at home, willappear in MOTHER NO. 63.
