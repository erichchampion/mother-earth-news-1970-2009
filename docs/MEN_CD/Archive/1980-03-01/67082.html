                    <p>      <em><strong>Lois Pritzlaff tells us how she raises all the      protein her family needs . . . in her garden!</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      We don't have cows, goats, chickens, or any other livestock      ... but we do raise protein! Our crop of the valuable      nutrient comes from our garden . . . in the form of green      soybeans for eating and freezing.    </p>    <p>      However, before you go out and plant your own plot of meat      substitute, you should be aware that there are two types of      soybeans grown in this country: a field variety that's used      for livestock fodder, oil, and industrial products . . .      and vegetable soybeans, which are bred for flavor.    </p>    <p>      It's the latter type of legume, of course, that you'll want      to grow for table use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE CHOICE GROWS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Years ago-when we planted our first healthful.      moneysaving protein crop-the few catalogs that      included the seed usually labeled soybeans as "novelty"      vegetables. Nowadays, though, many folks have discovered      (as the Chinese did over 2,000 years ago) the value of the      nutritious bean as people-food, and most seed companies      offer a number of varieties listed under "vegetable" or      "edible" soybeans.    </p>    <p>      When you're ready to select the type of soy you want to      plant, keep in mind that the crop will require an average      of three months of warm weather to mature. Therefore. if      you live in a cold climate, you should seek out an      early-ripening breed can't, of course, know which soybean      variety will grow best in your area, but-after      experimenting with several kinds-I can say that the      cultural tips in the seed catalogs have proved to be pretty      accurate.    </p>    <p>      Having faced the fact that frosts sometimes appear sooner      than expected on our Wisconsin farm, we started planting      two or three soy varieties "just in case". So far, the      precaution hasn't been a necessary one . . . as all our      crops have ripened before winter set in. On the other hand,      by growing a number of different types, we've been able to      make sure that our beans don't all mature at the same time      ... which allows us to put them up in smaller batches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANT'EM PROPERLY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Plan to purchase one pound of seed for every 150 feet of      garden row, and-at the same time-buy      nitrogen-fixing bacteria (also called a "seed inoculant")      to help them along. (Some inoculants will specify that they      should be used for soybeans, while other mixtures are      designed to aid the growth of any one of several kinds of      legumes. The proper bacteria, when present in the soil,      help the beans to absorb nitrogen from the air and store it      in their root nodules ... a process that not only aids      plant growth and bean production, but also improves the      soil's fertility.)    </p>    <p>      In order to get an early start on your crop, sow the seed      as soon after the last expected frost as you can. (Soybeans      are somewhat hardier than snap beans, so we usually plant      them a week earlier than the more common crop.)    </p>    <p>      And, although the nutrient-packed vegetables will grow in      any ordinary nonacid soil, the plot should be      <em>thoroughly culti</em> <em>vated.</em> If the ground is      already well-nourished, don't fertilize it further, because      too many nutrients can actually <em>retard the</em> growth      of soybeans. If, however. the area hasn't been enriched in      the past, the addition of such organic matter as      well-rotted manure or compost will improve the yield.    </p>    <p>      Just before planting, dampen the bean seeds with water and      mix in the nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Then place the seeds      1-1/2 inches deep in rows two feet apart, and thin the      seedlings-which will grow very much like bush snap      beans-to four inches apart.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RABBITS AND WEEDS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although we've never had a crop failure that was due to our      choice of variety, we have learned a couple of lessons the      hard way!    </p>    <p>      For example, we discovered that this otherwise remarkably      pest-free vegetation does have some mortal foes: rabbits!      The first time we grew soybeans, the ravenous little beasts      ate the emerging crop before we even realized what was      happening! Now, we simply put up a temporary fence around      the bean patch before the plants sprout, as a routine part      of our protein-growing procedure.    </p>    <p>      We learned our second lesson one spring when we went out of      town just as the small plants were coming up. Upon      returning, we saw that weeds had just about choked out our      garden, and only a few bean plants remained.    </p>    <p>      Be sure, therefore, to keep the young soybeans weed-free,      at least until they're big enough to stand on their own and      shade out the competition. From then on, they'll grow quite      nicely with very little attention from you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PUTTIN' 'EM AWAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you plan to use the soybeans green and freeze them, as      we do, they'll be ready to harvest when the pods become      plump in late summer. Don't put off the pickin' and      processin' task, though, because the pods and plants turn      from bright green to yellow in only a few days. Once that      "change" occurs, your beans will be too mature to freeze.    </p>    <p>      In my opinion, the easiest way to pick the pods is simply      to pull the plants up or cut them off with pruning shears      at ground level, depending on how easy it is (or isn't) to      get the roots out of your soil. Then you and your family      (or whoever else you enlist to help) can pick a comfortable      spot to do the pod pluckin'.    </p>    <p>      When you have a big pan full, wash the pods and blanch them      to aid in the removal of the beans. (If you don't have a      blanch ing kettle, just fill any large pot with enough hot      water to cover the legumes.    </p>    <p>      Bring the liquid to a rolling boil . . . put in your      harvest . . . allow the kettle to return to a full boil . .      . and then blanch the pods for five minutes.)    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, fill your sink or another large pot with very      cold water, and-when the boiling time is      up-immerse the steaming vegetables in the cold bath      ... <em>adding</em> more water, if necessary, to cool them      completely. Let the pods remain in the chilly soak for      another five minutes.    </p>    <p>      Removing the beans from their hulls is easy: All you have      to do is squeeze the seeds out over a bowl or pan. If      youngsters help, they'll probably soon discover      that-when you squish the pods just right-you      can "shoot" the beans a great distance. (Let 'em have a bit      of fun at first, and the tads will probably accomplish the      rest of the job very quickly and efficiently. Ever since my      daughters were quite small, they've really enjoyed taking      over this chore.)    </p>    <p>      Next, transfer the shelled beans to freezer containers,      leaving an inch or so of "head room". Then seal, label, and      freeze 'em ... and transfer the empty hulls to your compost      heap.    </p>    <p>      Although green soybeans contain only about one-third as      much protein as the dried variety, they're still higher in      this essential nutrient than any other vegetable . . . and      their succulent, nutlike flavor makes 'em the most      palatable, nutritious. low-starch garden produce around.      Furthermore, besides containing vitamin C (which dried      soybeans don't), the green edibles are also richer in      vitamin A than are the dried legumes.    </p>    <p>      I find the tasty morsels ideal for use as a meat      <em>extender . . . that</em> is, I merely use less meat and      <em>add</em> soybeans to my recipes for soup, stew, etc.      (This same technique can be employed when preparing      hamburgers, meatloaf, and almost any casserole that calls      for ground meat.) The remarkable vegetable can also be used      as a side dish all by itself.    </p>    <p>      So why not grow protein in <em>your</em> garden this year?      Then, after you've used up your first soybean      crop-probably in a variety of ways that I've never      even dreamed of-you'll want to plan to plant even      more next season!    </p>
