                    <p>      <strong>Your drinking supply</strong> -      <strong>whether it comes from the city or your own      well</strong> - <strong>may contain chemicals which      make it unfit for human consumption, unless you...</strong>    </p>        <p>      <br />      Our evaluation of water treatment devices began, as you may      know, in MOTHER NO. 61 . . . with an examination of      distillers. All three of the units that we discussed      qualified as water purifiers (that is, the devices removed      or killed <em>all</em> bacterial impurities), yet they      crossed an impressively broad range of capability and cost.      Similarly, the pieces of filtration equipment we're      reviewing in this installment vary considerably in both      capacity and price.    </p>    <p>      However, the seven filters we've had a chance to appraise      do have one thing in common: They all employ activated      carbon to filter out <em>chemical</em> impurities . .. such      as the carcinogenic trihalomethanes we talked about in      MOTHER NO. 61. (Note: Although they, too, use charcoal, the      General Ecology units rely on an even more effective      microstraining system for their primary impurity removal.)      Activated carbon - which is also called charcoal      - has been used for cleansing for over 100 years . .      . functioning, for example, as the stripping agent in World      War I gas masks and as the medium used for decolorizing      sugar. It's only recently, however, that the versatile      material has come to be used in water filtration.    </p>    <p>      Because activated carbon's "cleaning" ability depends      entirely on the amount of surface area contact -      between the cleanser and the water - that's      available, a filter's performance is largely determined by      the volume of carbon inside it and the length of time the      water remains in contact with the carbon ... a      consideration which is called "residence time".      Unfortunately, extensive residence time can result in the      growth of bacteria on the charcoal . . . and each of the      manufacturers included in our study has dealt with that      problem in a different fashion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AMERICAN WATER PURIFICATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Both of the California-based American Water Purification      Company's filters have silver infused into their charcoal      to inhibit any bacterial growth. In addition, the smaller      of the two units - the Water Washer - has      builtin flow control to prevent the operator from      inadvertently reducing residence time below a safe level.      Another useful feature of the limited-capacity model is a      viewing port to give the owner a visual warning when the      filter element is dirty.    </p>    <p>      The UTS Silverator is an under-sink model which can be used      either to filter all the cold water at that location, or to      deliver the cleansed liquid to its own faucet to be used      for drinking and cooking only. In the latter application,      the Silverator's 5,000-gallon-life filter should last for a      very long time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BESTWATER</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Louisville, Kentucky manufacturer's product is by far      the most ambitious filtration setup of those we sampled.      Its capacity - as well as its size - is several      times that of any of the other devices . . . great enough,      in fact, to process all the water entering a household.      Furthermore, even at its maximum flow rate of two gallons      per minute, the BestWater retains water for a full two      minutes <em>and</em> provides about one year of filter      life. Since the unit is almost constantly in use - on      a residence's main water line - bacterial build-up      isn't a problem.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GENERAL ECOLOGY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Both of this company's Seagull models are unique among      water filters because they are classed as "purifiers" by      the Environmental Protection Agency. The devices remove      bacteria - as well as cysts, amoebae, protozoa, and      small fragments of materials like asbestos - by a      microstraining process which is effective down to 0.4      microns. (For comparison, a red blood cell is about 7      microns.)    </p>    <p>      The Seagull 1.5L is a limited-capacity unit designed      primarily to purify drinking water. It is available with a      hand pump for remote use, and the filter element is      actually the body of the device. The larger model, the      Seagull IV, can be used under a sink or on the countertop.      With 1,000 gallons (approximately) of useful filter life,      the mid-sized "strainer" can be expected to treat all the      water used in a kitchen.    </p>		    <p>      <strong>SEARS, ROEBUCK AND COMPANY</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the manuals for the two Sears water filters we sampled,      the firm recommends that - if either unit has been      unused for over a day - the element be flushed with a      brief flow of water before use . . . thereby extracting any      bacterial growth. The technique is effective but, of      course, does waste a portion of the filter's treatment      capacity.    </p>    <p>      The Instapure by Water Pik is the smallest filter we      examined. It attaches to the end of a faucet and is      designed to be used at less than 1/2 GPM ... although,      because of the device's limited area of filtration, we'd be      inclined to keep the flow rate to about a quart a minute.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, the Taste and Odor filter is a      large-capacity unit which - like the UTS Silverator      - can be used either to treat all the water at one      sink or to deliver cleansed liquid to a specific separate      tap.    </p>    <p>      In addition to its line of filters, Sears offers a free      water evaluation service-available by mail or through any      catalog store -which provides an analysis of your water      quality and offers suggestions for treatment techniques.    </p>                                    <p>      <strong>      HOW FAR IS UP?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Choosing a filtration system for your home depends -      for the most part - upon what kind of treatment you      need and how much liquid you will want filtered. Units as      large as the BestWater can help eliminate ugly rings in      your bathtub as well as provide high-quality drinking      water. But if you're looking only for something to give you      a better glass of water than you normally get from the tap,      the Instapure will do the job.    </p>    <p>      Of course, General Ecology's devices - because      they're officially classed as purifiers - can be      expected to provide exceptionally high-quality liquid . . .      and will even render unsafe water potable. And the American      Water Purification filters offer a viable mid-capacity,      mid-price solution to extracting nasty chemicals from your      drinking supply.    </p>    <p>      Each of the filters that we've examined proved to be a      well-put-together piece of equipment designed for a      particular purpose. Once you've determined what your needs      are - perhaps by having a water sample analyzed by      Sears or another laboratory - you can pick any one of      them with confidence.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: As we promised in MOTHER NO. 61, the      next water treatment article will look into a few of the      less common - though potentially quite effective      - methods of cleansing water. Among the final      article's candidates are several reverse osmosis devices, a      magnetic filter, and an ultraviolet light purifier.</em>    </p>
