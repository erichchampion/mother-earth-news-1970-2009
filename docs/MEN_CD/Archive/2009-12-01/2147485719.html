        <p><em>This recipe is excerpted from the new book</em> <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=4292" target="_blank">Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day: 100 New Recipes Featuring Whole Grains, Fruits, Vegetables and Gluten-free Ingredients</a><em> (Thomas Dunne Books, 2009).

Either will work, but you may have to adjust the amount of water.</p><p>This recipe makes enough dough for four 1-pound loaves, and can easily be doubled or halved.</p><p><em>2 cups 10-grain hot cereal (Bob’s Red Mill brand), uncooked<br />3 cups white whole wheat flour (made from wheat varieties with pale, mild-tasting bran layers)<br />2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br />1 1/2 tbsp (2 packets)<br />granulated yeast<br />1 tbsp kosher salt (or to taste)<br />1/4 cup vital wheat gluten<br />3 1/2 cups lukewarm water<br />1 to 2 tbsp seed mixture for sprinkling on top of the crust: sesame, flaxseed, caraway, sunflower, poppy and/or anise</em></p><p>Whisk together the cereal, flours, yeast, salt and vital wheat gluten in a 5-quart bowl, or a lidded (not airtight) food container.</p><p>Add the water and mix without kneading, using a spoon, a food processor (with dough attachment) or a heavy-duty stand mixer (with paddle). You may need to get your hands wet to get the flour to incorporate if not using a machine.</p><p>Cover (not airtight), and allow the dough to rest at room temperature until it rises and collapses (or flattens on top), approximately 2 hours.</p><p>The dough can be used immediately after the initial rise, though it is easier to handle when cold. Refrigerate it in a lidded (not airtight) container and use over the next week.</p><p>On baking day, dust the surface of the refrigerated dough with flour and cut off a 1-pound (grapefruit-size) piece. Dust with more flour and quickly shape it into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go.</p><p>Elongate the ball into an oval. Allow the loaf to rest for 90 minutes (40 minutes if you’re using fresh, unrefrigerated dough), covered loosely with plastic wrap, on a pizza peel prepared with cornmeal or lined with parchment paper. Alternatively, you can let the loaf rest on a silicone mat or a greased cookie sheet.</p><p>Thirty minutes before baking time, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, with a baking stone near the middle rack. Place an empty broiler tray on any other rack.</p><p>Just before baking, use a pastry brush to paint the top crust with water. Sprinkle with the seed mixture and slash the loaf with 1/4-inch-deep parallel cuts, using a serrated knife.</p><p>Slide the loaf directly onto the hot stone (or place the silicone mat or cookie sheet on the stone if you used one). Pour a cup of hot water into the broiler tray, and quickly close the oven door. Bake for about 30 minutes, until richly browned and firm. If you used parchment paper, a silicone mat, or a cookie sheet under the loaf, carefully remove it and bake it directly on the stone or an oven shelf at about two-thirds of the way through baking time. (Smaller or larger loaves will require adjustments in resting and baking time.)</p><p>Allow to cool on a rack before slicing.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.healthybreadinfive.com/" target="_blank">healthybreadinfive.com</a> to find instructional text, photographs, videos and a community of other five-minutes-a-day bakers.
