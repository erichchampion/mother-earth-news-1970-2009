        <p>Here is a hint for remembering to send birthday and anniversary cards on time. At the start of the new year, I count all of the birthdays and anniversaries for the year, and purchase the cards. Then I address the cards and put the date the card is to be mailed in the corner where the stamp will be.</p><p>I put the cards in order by month and check the pile at the beginning of each month. When itâ€™s time to mail the card, I simply write a short greeting, sign the card, affix the stamp and pop it right into the mailbox. This greeting card organizer takes a bit of work in January, but the reward is the ease of sending cards the rest of the year.</p><h5>Donna Beaver<br />Topeka, Kansas</h5>
