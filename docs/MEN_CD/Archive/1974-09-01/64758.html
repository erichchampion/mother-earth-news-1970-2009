                     <h5 id="byline">     by D.S. HALACY    </h5>       <p>      Â©1959 by D.S. Halacy, Jr., and originally published by      the Macmillan <em>Company as a chapter of the book,</em>      Fun With<br />      The Sun. <em>Reprinted by permission of the author.</em>    </p>    <p>      Ninety years ago, mine owners in the high country of Chile      were faced with the problem of providing drinking water for      their workers. The only available supply was unfit to      drink, and so a means of purifying the liquid had to be      found. Amazingly, the solution was a sun-operated      distilling plant in which a large area of glassed-over      wooden frames evaporated the contaminated water,      recondensed it . . . and thus produced as much as 6,000      gallons of fresh water in a day!    </p>    <p>      This solar still used no fuel or power except that from the      sun's rays and was thus able to provide pure water at a      cost unmatched by any other means of distillation. Oddly,      the method was forgotten in the intervening years and      fueloperated stills were used whenever it was necessary to      convert salty-or otherwise undrinkable water-to      fresh.    </p>    <p>      Not until World War II were solar stills used again except      by experimenters. Fliers forced down at sea needed a source      of supply of drinking water until they could be rescued.      Dr. Maria Telkes developed an inexpensive, lightweight      plastic still that could be included in even one-man life      rafts and that would produce a quart of fresh water a day.    </p>    <p>      Since that time Dr. Telkes and other scientists have worked      with solar stills of various sizes. Our government's      Department of the Interior is interested in the idea, and      plans have been made for large seacoast installations to      purify salt water for drinking and irrigation. In some      designs no pumps would re needed because the sea itself      would fill the condensing tanks at high tide.    </p>    <p>      At present it is felt that the cost of such a system would      be too high, even considering that cost of operation would      be less than that of a fuel-run still. Engineers are      hopeful, however, that improved methods and materials will      make the plan feasible.    </p>    <p>      The principle of the solar still is a simple one, and is      observed on a grand scale in nature. Clouds are droplets of      water evaporated from the surface of the sea or from damp      ground and then condensed high in the air. In the process      of evaporation, solids such as salt are left behind. Many      readers will be familiar with the commercial harvesting of      salt in shallow ponds, for this is one of the oldest of      man's uses of solar energy.    </p>    <p>      The still described here uses the same principle, but is a      little more complex than simply letting sea water run into      a pond to evaporate. By means of a glass-plate collector we      will increase the temperature in the still to speed      evaporation. The design is borrowed from Dr. Telkes, and      has been proved by careful testing over a long period of      time. Researchers have shown that it's possible to produce      almost a quart and a half of water a day for each square      foot of the collector's surface. Thus the unit should have      a maximum output of more than one gallon a day. Of course,      this figure represents ideal conditions, but it will be      interesting to compare your results with the calculated      output. The still described here was tested in mid-winter,      and produced more than one quart in six hours.    </p>          <h3>MATERIALS</h3>        <p>      1 by-4-inch redwood board (8 linear feet)<br />      1/2-inch plywood (one piece, 24 by 24 inches)<br />      Single-weight window glass (one piece, cut to      measure)<br />      1/2-inch O.D. copper tubing (4-1/2 feet)<br />      1/2-inch, 90-degree copper elbow (one)<br />      1/2-inch copper pipe cap (one)<br />      Galvanized iron (one piece, 3 by 24 inches)<br />      1/4-inch I.D. copper tube (six inches)<br />      Large tin can (one)<br />      1 /4-by-1-1/2-inch wood screws (approximately 30)<br />      Black terry cloth (approximately two yards . . . one large      bath towel)    </p>    <p>      To begin construction, first assemble all the needed      materials (except the glass). Redwood is preferred where      possible because it resists rotting, while other woods will      deteriorate with constant exposure to water.    </p>    <p>      At the lumberyard where you buy the 8-foot board (1 by 4      inches) have a groove cut 1/8 inch wide to a depth of 3/8      inch. Locate the cut 1/2 inch from one edge. This is the      slot for the glass window. Next cut the 1-by-4 redwood      sidepieces to the proper length as shown in Fig. 1.    </p>        <p>      Drill two holes at each corner of the sidepieces and      assemble them with wood screws. The 1/2-inch plywood back      may now be put in place and holes drilled for screws.      Notice that no screws are put in at the corners, to prevent      interference with those which hold the sides together.    </p>    <p>      Mark the locations for the large holes that will receive      the 1/2-inch tubing. Drill a 1/8-inch hole as a guide, and      then drill three 5/8inch holes and one 3/4-inch hole, as      shown. Be sure the large hole is the proper size for the      cap, which we'll solder to the end of the top tube.    </p>    <p>      The two drain holes-both 1/4 inch in      diameter-can now be drilled. One is located in the      center of the bottom 1-by-4; the other is in the side      1-by-4, positioned at the vee formed by the bottom and      plywood back. Study the drawing to be sure of locating this      hole properly. The side drain can now be inserted.    </p>    <p>      This is a good time to caulk the joints at the bottom and      sides and apply several coats of sealer to the inside of      the collector box . . . to make it watertight, and so that      the distilled water will run out the drain tube and not      seep through the bottom of the box. Allow to dry thoroughly      and check for leaks.    </p>    <p>      We know that any surface receiving heat will reradiate part      of that warmth. To prevent as much heat loss as possible,      and also to present a smooth surface for condensation of      water vapor, we'll line the inside of the box with aluminum      foil. Running the foil in one piece across the plywood back      and the bottom 1-by-4 will make an additional waterproof      layer to help proper drainage. Notice that the foil extends      into the bottom glass slot also.    </p>    <p>      A single piece of foil 24 inches wide will do the job. If      you find it necessary to use narrower foil, apply the      section toward the drain tube first and lap the other piece      over it. Use glue, rubber cement or airplane dope to apply      the covering. Start at the top, carefully unrolling the      foil for a smooth job. Let its edge extend a quarter inch      past the edge of the glass slot. This excess will be forced      into the slot later when the glass is slid into place. Next      line the inside surface of the other three 1-by-4's to      complete the job.    </p>    <p>      Since some salty or otherwise undesirable water may not be      evaporated before it reaches the bottom of the black towel      wick, we provide a vee-shaped trough to catch this waste      and prevent it from mixing with the distilled water at the      bottom of the still. Made from galvanized iron, this      24-inch trough is a 90-degree angle with legs 1-1/2 inches      wide. This can best be bent at the sheet metal shop.    </p>    <p>      Drill a hole in the very center of the angle, as shown in      Fig. 1, to receive the center 1/4-inch copper drain tube.      Put the short length of tubing in place and solder      securely. To keep the waste water from spilling out the      ends of the trough, curve it slightly by "crimping" its      edges in several places.    </p>    <p>      Once the drain trough is completed it may be put in place      by inserting the copper tube in the hole drilled for it.      This should be a snug fit. Carefully punch through the      aluminum foil first with a pencil, then press the trough      down until it just touches the foil at the center.    </p>    <p>      We're now ready to start on the still's "wick". The      1/2-inch tubing used at the top and bottom to support the      toweling is cut to size with a tubing cutter or fine      hacksaw. Or give your hardware dealer accurate dimensions      and ask him to do this for you.    </p>    <p>      In addition to holding the toweling in place, the top tube      is the distributor for the water supply. To accomplish this      we drill two rows of No. 50 holes, at right angles to each      other. The holes do not go through both walls of the tubing      and are spaced approximately 2 inches apart.    </p>    <p>      Our still uses a quart can as a reservoir. Cut the top from      a large juice container and remove the paper. Next, cut a      4-inch length of 1/2-inch copper tubing and flatten one end      in a vise or with a hammer. This tube will serve to meter      the water into the long tube so that too much isn't fed to      the toweling.    </p>    <p>      With a chisel, carefully cut a slit in the center of the      reservoir's bottom. Allow the metal to bend inward      slightly, and check the size of the slit until the      flattened tube fits snugly with about 1/2 inch extending      inside the can. Make sure the tube remains lined up while      you solder it in place.    </p>    <p>      Now solder the cap onto the other end of the drilled top      tube. Push the tube through the holes in the box, taking      care not to tear the aluminum foil lining. Prop up the box      so that it's tilted back about 45 degrees from the vertical      and rotate the tube so that the two rows of holes are      properly positioned to feed water into the toweling when      it's looped around the tube. The tilt of our still will      vary with the position of the sun, so we're striking a      happy medium in locating these holes.    </p>    <p>      With the tube in the right position, force the end cap into      the 3/4-inch hole. This should be a snug fit and hold the      assembly in the proper place. Now solder the 1/2-inch elbow      to the open end of the tube so that it points straight up.      The free end of the tube soldered to the can is inserted in      the elbow and soldered in place. Some water in the bottom      of the can will prevent the joint at the can from melting      while you work on the elbow.    </p>    <p>      Next attach a hinged 1-by-4 prop to the back of the box,      using small wood screws as required. This supports the      still and also gives us a means of adjusting the tilt to      best face the sun. At this time also nail on the two legs,      making sure to leave the proper one about 1/4-inch long so      that water will run toward the fresh water drain.    </p>    <p>      Smooth the ends of the bottom tube that will support the      toweling and insert it in place . . . and you're ready to      sew the toweling together. The still in our plans uses a      towel 24 inches wide, with the ends lapped and sewed in two      places (along both edges of the lap) to make a loop. In      measuring for this, make the loop slightly smaller than the      distance between the tubes, because the towel will stretch      somewhat when wet. Too much sag would cause it to touch the      back of the box and thus contaminate the distilled water.    </p>    <p>      With the towel sewed together and dampened, slip the      1/2-inch tubes halfway out and start the towel loop onto      the supports inside the box (see Fig. 2). The bottom tube      is slid back into place first, then the top one is      carefully raised into position and forced back into the      3/4-inch hole. Adjust the towel so that it covers the      entire length of the tubes and is smooth. Do not let it      touch the sides of the box.    </p>    <p>      At this point, remove the top 1-by-4 piece so that the      dimensions for the box's glass front can be taken. Slide a      heavy piece of cardboard into the grooves and trim it to      fit. Then have your supplier cut a pane of glass to the      size of the pattern. The grade of window glass known as      "water-white" allows more of the sun's rays to pass than an      ordinary pane does and is therefore more efficient for our      purpose. However, if it's not available, standard      single-strength glass will do.    </p>    <p>      Slide the glass into position. Make sure it's as clean as      it can be . . . particularly on the inner surface, which      will not be easy to reach when the still is assembled.      Detergents may interfere with proper forming of droplets on      the glass, so use plain water for cleansing.    </p>    <p>      Handle the glass very carefully to avoid cutting yourself      on its sharp edges. With the still at a 45-degree angle,      start the glass into the slots and ease it downward. When      it contacts the aluminum foil at the bottom groove the      glass should force the foil neatly into place. Replace the      top piece of wood, tighten the screws and the still is      ready for operation.    </p>    <p>      Distillation is easy with our solar plant. First, orient      the unit so that the- sun's rays strike it as close to a      right angle as possible. Mount the still on a level surface      so that the uneven legs will give it the proper slant for      draining. If the reservoir can is not vertical, carefully      twist the container until it is. The towel should be snug      enough to hold it, and the force fit of the end cap in the      3/4-inch hole also helps in this respect.    </p>    <p>      Now fill the reservoir, and to make sure that the still      really works, add some salt to the water! After a few      minutes the towel will begin to receive the liquid from the      distribution tube. If it doesn't, or if the flow is too      slow, very carefully open up the flattened tube in the      bottom of the can with the point of an ice pick. Be      cautious about this, however, as we don't want the water to      flow into the towel faster than it can be evaporated.    </p>    <p>      Heat from the sun is trapped in the box, and the black      towel absorbs this. Water is therefore evaporated from the      towel much faster than it would be normally. The vapor,      free of all solids, recondenses on the smooth surface of      the glass and the foil on the back and sides. You'll see      this a few minutes after you put in the water; first the      glass steams up, then droplets form and run down to the      bottom.    </p>    <p>      Don't expect the water to gush from the still like a      Niagara, but put a can or bottle under the drain to catch      the distilled fluid. On a sunny day the still will begin      producing soon after you set it in operation and will drip      water steadily into the container. To guard against      evaporation of this distilled water, some experimenters run      a tube from the drain to a corked bottle.    </p>    <p>      At first you'll probably reposition the still every half      hour or so for greatest efficiency. When the novelty wears      off, however, you'll likely decide on a compromise      tilt-your latitude plus 10 degrees or so-and      aim the collector south (unless you live below the Equator,      of course).    </p>
