                        <p>      <strong>IT'S EASY TO CUT ELECTRIC HEATING BILLS BY      ONE-THIRD</strong> : Just install a heat pump. Heat pumps      (which can either collect warmth at Point A and move it to      Point B or vice versa) are--thanks to the energy      crunch--suddenly coming into their own. Engineers say that,      "Compared to other forms of electrical heaters, these units      are 200 to 250% efficient." If you're interested in      learning more about them, see your local heating      contractor. General Electric, Westinghouse, Lennox and      other major furnace/air conditioning manufacturers already      have begun a major marketing push of the pumps.    </p>       <p>      <strong>WIND POWER AND SOLAR ENERGY</strong> have already      been harnessed by the oil industry. Shell, Atlantic      Richfield, Tenneco and other large petroleum companies are      currently using small solar-powered equipment (foghorns,      warning lights, etc.) on drilling platforms in the Gulf of      Mexico. The firms are also conducting serious tests on      windplants with 3-to-7-foot-diameter propellers (and      outputs ranging from 16 to 150 watts). Business Week      reports that oilmen now figure on using Gulf breezes to      supply electricity to half of the 2,800 offshore drilling      platforms located in that body of water.    </p>       <p>      <strong>MASS-PRODUCED SOLAR COLLECTOR COMPONENTS</strong>      are now available from both Olin Brass and Revere Copper      & Brass. See your nearest supplier of Olin and Revere      industrial products for specifications and prices.    </p>     <p>      <strong>DON'T EXPECT MUCH</strong> from the World Energy      Conference, scheduled for September 23-27 in Detroit,      Michigan. Lavish advance promotion brands the gathering as      a big-government-big-business-as-usual waste of time. When      the newly formed American Wind Energy Association applied      for admittance to the conference, it was turned down.      ("You're too late;' AWEA representatives were told.)      Result: Undaunted AWEAers decided to hold their own      alternative energy conference in Detroit on September      20-21... with maybe just a little of their meeting being      extended to overlap the WEC clambake. AWEAer Al O'Shay--of      Detroit's Environmental Energies, Inc. (21243 Grand River,      Detroit, Michigan 48219)--expects to have his solar, wind      and methane powered store open by then and has offered its      use as unofficial headquarters for the AWEA meet. Contact      Nancy Horning at the Grand River address (1-313-533-1985)      for further details.    </p>        <p>      <strong>ENERGY ALTERNATIVES, INC.</strong> , is the new      firm set up in Leverett, Massachusetts by Klaus Kroner "for      the purpose of promoting wind, sun, tidal and thermal      gradient power". The company plans to spread the good word      about alternative energy sources of all kinds and is      already a distributor for the Winco (of Iowa) and Dunlite      (of Australia) wind-driven generators. Call 1-413-549-3635      for further details or write Klaus Kroner, Energy      Alternatives, Inc., P.O. Box 233, Leverett, Massachusetts      01054.    </p>       <p>      <strong>AND HERE'S SOME OF THOSE GOOD WORDS FROM KLAUS      KRONER NOW:</strong> The Massachusetts Audubon Society is      thinking about operating one of their office buildings in      Lincoln on wind-generated electricity. The organization has      a large tower (from an old military installation) next to      its headquarters and society officials are looking for a      windplant with which to top the structure.    </p>       <p>      <strong>AND MORE:</strong> The University of Massachusetts      offered a course in wind system design this summer and the      response was tremendous. An Energy Alternatives generator      is currently being used by the U of M to test advanced      windplant propeller designs. Many other universities and      schools of engineering in the U.S. and Canada also have      instituted such courses and research work.    </p>
