                    <div class="sidebar">		<h3>      CYNTHIA W. KITTENDORF    </h3>    <p>      At the end of his chapter on "Building and Health Codes",      reprinted in MOTHER NO. 28, Les Scher listed three      organizations that make up building codes and can be      consulted on the requirements for various aspects of a      construction project. Since the excerpt appeared, Les has      sent MOTHER three further addresses to be added to that      list:    </p>    <p>      (The National Building Code)<br />      National Board of Fire Underwriters<br />      85 John Street<br />      New York, N.Y. 10805    </p>		</div>    <p>      (The Basic Building Code of America)<br />      Building Officials and Code Administrators International,      Inc. (BOCA)<br />      1313 E. 60th Street<br />      Chicago, III. 60637    </p>    <p>      (The Uniform Building Code)<br />      Southern Building Code Congress<br />      3617 8th Avenue South<br />      Birmingham, Ala. 35212    </p>    <p>      I've just finished reading "Real Estate Agents, Realtors      and Salesmen"-a chapter from Les Scher's <em>Finding      and Buying Your Place in the Country</em> <em>-</em>      in MOTHER NO. 27. After allowing myself a lengthy and      anguished "Arrggh!" over the author's numerous mistakes,      misconceptions and obvious unfamiliarity with the entire      field, I now set out to write a rebuttal.    </p>    <p>      First of all, I am a <em>realtor</em> . I'm not a      "swamp-peddler", as they used to be known in this neck of      the Florida woods, nor do I stay awake nights dreaming of      ways to defraud the innocent of their hard-earned dollars.      Actually, those Mr. Scher would have us believe are      skulking around every corner-waiting to lie,      misrepresent facts and deceive us about our little plot of      earth-are few in number and becoming fewer still.      This state publishes a monthly list of those who have had      their licenses suspended or revoked for all sorts of      malpractices. To condemn an entire profession on the      strength of isolated examples is absurd.    </p>    <p>      The realtor has labored long and hard to obtain his      professional status. To blow it by stating to some poor      soul that a babbling brook runs through the land the      "victim" intends to buy-when, in fact, that brook is      on a neighbor's property-is not only insane, it's      fraud and misrepresentation. Know what can happen when you      pull a cute trick like that? You can lose your license,      period.    </p>    <p>      And what if the <em>seller told</em> the salesman that the      brook was on his property, and the salesman passed on the      information? The salesman can lose his      license-zip-because he didn't check the      statement to make sure it was fact . . . and the broker can      lose <em>his</em> license because he's responsible for the      dummy who was too lazy to do his job right.    </p>    <p>      Failure to mention to a prospective buyer that the six-lane      Interstate just might be passing through the downstairs      john of that nice little house this time next year doesn't      exactly net you a slap on the wrist, either. Drop by your      local Board of Realtors for confirmation, if you like, or      write the National Association of Real Estate Brokers and      ask about some recent court decisions. Do you honestly      think any responsible broker in his right mind is going to      risk his career for one illegal commission? Forget it!    </p>    <p>      Another point: The average individual doesn't buy real      estate every day, and is obviously going to be unfamiliar      with the proceedings. If you have questions, <em>ask</em>      -and keep on asking-before you sign anything.      If the salesman you're dealing with can't give you an      answer, see the broker . . . and if <em>he</em> doesn't      know, and makes no effort to find out, then you've got one      of the type Les Scher was writing about. Immediately switch      agents. A reliable member of the profession will not      automatically shrug off all questions as unimportant or      merely secondary to the deal, as Les describes.    </p>    <p>      Scher also seems to be under some sort of misconception      about whom the broker represents. He states as fact that      the agent works for the seller. This is a mistake. The      fiduciary relationship may lie with <em>either</em> the      buyer or the seller. The latter customarily pays the      commission, but that's not gospel, either.    </p>    <p>      Les also indicates that when an exclusive right to sell or      an exclusive agency agreement exists, only the listing      broker may show the property. Wrong again, Les, old buddy.      Brokers cooperate, on a regular basis, in the sale of hind.      Ever hear of MLS (Multiple Listing Service)?    </p>    <p>      The logical approach to a sale is to secure a meeting of      the minds between the seller and a qualified buyer, at a      price and terms agreeable to both, in a minimum amount of      time. If a listing broker is approached by a colleague      whose client is wild about a certain property, his response      is not going to be, "Tough luck, sweetie." Normally a      contract is submitted and, in the event of a sale, the      agents split the commission. The exclusive listing is      merely to protect the person who invests his time and money      to sell the land . . . so that his efforts won't go down      the drain if a fellow realtor appears with a suitable      buyer.    </p>    <p>      A final bit of advice to the prospective land buyer: Your      best bet when you're property hunting is to look for the      "Realtor" insignia on the broker's sign. The new national      emblem is a single "R" in blue and gold, with the word      "Realtor" below. We may not all wear white hats in this      business . . . but with the local and national Boards of      Realtors playing "Big Brother", we're certainly going to      watch our step. The profession's code of ethics is      admirable and we who join the board do so because we      believe in fair play and honest practices.    </p>    <p>      <em>Cynthia's letter is just one of many I've received on      the</em> <em>same subject from brokers all over the map and      I'm sorry that so many honest and conscientious business      men and women have been offended by some of the statements      in "Real Estate Agents, Realtors and Salesmen" :</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Nevertheless, there's no getting round the fact that      abuses do occur. Les Scher-a practicing attorney who      specializes in land transactions-assures us that all      the shady practices he described can be illustrated with      numerous examples from his own files . . . and that the      same tricks were tried on him when he went land hunting in      the guise of an innocent layman. What's more, Les has met      with such cases so often that he's become a keen advocate      of legislation to protect the real estate consumer.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The profession's self-regulating efforts-as      outlined in Cynthia's rebuttal-are indeed      praiseworthy, and the many brokers who subscribe to the      standards set by NAREB deserve wholehearted respect and      support. As long as less ethical agents are still among us,      however, the buyer should be aware of the fact and know how      to protect himself... and Les Scher's book is intended to      help him do just that.-MOTHER.</em>    </p>
