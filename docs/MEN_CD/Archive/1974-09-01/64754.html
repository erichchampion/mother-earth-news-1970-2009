    <p>
                        <p>      Robert and Kathy Reed-a young married couple living      in Saratoga, California-are just plain folks like      most of us . . . <em>except for one astounding fact.</em>      Since December 1972 they've helped feed 1,500,000 children      scattered throughout Honduras, Haiti, Greece and other      hunger-pocked areas of the globe! How so? The Reeds each      made a very personal decision to <em>not</em> let a      crisis-crunched world overwhelm them. Instead, Bob and      Kathy optimistically concentrated on finding something      <em>they</em> could do to alleviate human suffering. And      this lead to their affiliation with the Cooperative for      American Relief Everywhere.    </p>    <p>      "Although we were vaguely aware of CARE's existence      before," Bob says, "we'd never contributed. But now the      light came on." And a blazing light it was. Quickly      bypassing the easy option of making regular donations to      the Cooperative, the Reeds used their own natural ingenuity      and deep concern to produce something that would snowball      their talents into massive assistance for a famineridden      world. That "something" is-of course-the WE      CARE COOKBOOK.    </p>    <p>      After spending weeks researching hundreds of "receipt      books" from the 1800's and early 1900's at the University      of California-and working with the close cooperation      of the San Francisco Field Office of CARE-Bob and      Kathy published the COOKBOOK. It contains 300 of the best      old-timey recipes they could gather . . . all based on      natural-food ingredients and reprinted in their original      wording (hurrah!). Here's a sampling of the goodies that      graced the dining tables of our forefathers and are      featured in the Reeds' kitchen manual: scalloped tomatoes,      individual chicken shortcakes, oyster croquettes, ham      boiled in cider, chocolate gingerbread, wine jelly, lemon      ice cream (from scratch) and deviled crabs. The attractive      pen sketches and borderline prints throughout the guide      further enhance its old-fashioned appeal.    </p>    <p>      Like to see for yourself? The following three recipes are      reprinted straight from the WE CARE COOKBOOK:    </p>        <h3>STEWED BRISKET OF BEEF</h3>     <p>      Put the part that has the hard fat into a stew-pot, with a      small quantity of water; let it boil up, and skim it      thoroughly; then add carrots, turnips, onions, celery and a      few pepper-corns. Stew till extremely tender; then take out      all the flat bones and remove all the fat from the soup.      Either serve that and the meat in a tureen, or the soup      alone, and the meat on a dish, garnished with some      vegetables. The following sauce is much admired served with      the beef: Take half a pint of the soup, and mix it with a      spoonful of catsup, a teaspoonful of made mustard, a little      flour, a bit of butter and salt; boil all together a few      minutes, then pour it round the meat.    </p>        <h3>STUFFED CABBAGE LEAVES</h3>        <p>      Parboil and chop lean mutton, mix it with an equal quantity      of boiled rice, and season with salt, pepper, and butter.      Use the white leaves of cabbage. Lay a large spoonful of      the meat and rice on each leaf, fold, and tie securely. Tie      all the prepared leaves in cheese-cloth and boil slowly for      half an hour in the water in which the mutton was boiled.      Take off the cloth, remove the strings, and serve with      melted butter.    </p>         <h3>CHEESE STRAWS</h3>       <p>      One-quarter of a pound of grated cheese, two ounces of      flour, four ounces of butter, yolk of one egg, dessert      spoonful of mustard. Make a thick paste of all the      ingredients; roll it out, and cut into long and narrow      strips. Bake a light brown. About ten minutes will be      sufficient.    </p>    <p>      Bob and Kathy-assisted by publicity and cooperation      from CARE-have generated enormous enthusiasm for      their country-kitchen Baedeker in the past 18 months. And      it's little wonder! Each copy of the COOKBOOK that is sold      ($3.45 for California residents, $3.30 for out-of-state      buyers) sends one dollar winging into the coffers of CARE .      . . where <em>that single buck is transformed into a      nourishing, protein packed breakfast or lunch for 300      children!</em> What kind of a meal? "A better one than most      American kids eat each morning," says Robert. "The meal      consists of CSM-corn, soya and milk-the main      food substance used by CARE in their overseas food      programs. The CSM is mixed with water and then local      vegetables are added to the dish." The Reeds have actually      enjoyed a few CSM meals around their own family dining      table . . . with the full concurrence of the littlest      household members: Robby (8), Alan (6) and Tanya (5).    </p>    <p>      "So far," Kathy says, between what must be joyous smiles of      triumph, "the project has fed what Tanya calls 'sezma food'      to over a million and a half youngsters. It has also helped      finance a few things for some local groups. We contribute      50 cents a copy to clubs that sell 25 or more COOKBOOKS . .      . so ten people selling ten copies each can feed 30,000      children plus earn $50.00 for one of their organization's      own projects."    </p>    <p>      How do the Reeds feel today about that "bright idea" they      had back in December 1972? "It's been a lot of work to take      care of all the shipping, advanced monies for printing and      other business chores," the young Californians confess,      "but it's just been a great thing-a very      <em>satisfying thing-</em> for us to work on. <em>We      hope to feed a million more kids by Christmas</em> '74. "    </p>    <p>      Folks who'd be proud to cut themselves in on some of that      warmhearted glow can order their old-timey receipt book      from Kathy's and Bob's storefront operation: WE CARE      COOKBOOK, 18581 McFarland Avenue, Saratoga, California      95070. Or-if you have all the recipes you need right      now (is it possible?)-Kathy suggests that you still      "send a little to help CARE . . . we'll be glad to pass it      on".-CK.    </p>
