                           <p class="credit">      <em>The following article is reprinted by permission from      Thomas Paine Ditto Works. Copyright 1974 by</em> The House      Organ.    </p>    			<hr />    <p>      In a recent issue, <strong>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      (restricted)</strong> appealed to readers for information on milk      sheep <em>(See the comment with Montie R. Davidson's letter      in Issue No. 26, page 114.-MOTHER.).</em> Answering      that appeal both gives me a chance to play "know-it-all"      and to tell you that Anastasia, our canny old Suffolk ewe,      <em>has-once again-</em> saved herself from      <em>a</em> mutton chop finale . . . this time by feigning      pregnancy until she'd captivated the hearts of her new      patrons, T. and J.    </p>    <p>      We can only smile at Anastasia's success since she taught      us almost all we know about sheep. Bruce Lansdale-of the      American Farm School in Salonica, Greece-taught us the      rest. Around the Mediterranean, sheep's milk is more highly      prized than the cow's product and is the <em>fourth</em>      crop (after wool, mutton and lambs) of this docile      ruminant.    </p>    <p>      I don't know which breeds of the animal make the best      milkers although-around the Mediterranean      basin-Barbary sheep are held in high esteem. When      selecting a type you probably should consider your location      (environment, altitude and latitude), the breed's sheeping      ratio and its mothering qualities. We tend to think that      sheep with a proven tendency to raise their lambs should be      given the edge in the selection process. Livestock books      can tell you which domesticated breeds in this country make      the best mothers.    </p>    <p>      <em>Any</em> sheep can be a milk sheep provided that it's      female, has recently had a baby and has been trained to      supply milk at the convenience of a human rather than at      the demand of the yeanling. As with other mammals, a great      deal depends on getting the ewe to "let down" her milk. She      may be a good producer . . . but the skill of her owner is      what relaxes her and gets the white nectar into the pail.      This requires [1] authoritative handling and [2] a      stanchion at which the sheep learns to feed while being      milked.    </p>         <h3>THE STANCHION</h3>        <p>      Since sheep are sometimes temperamental, you should train      your ewes to feed at the stanchion even before they lamb .      . . so that they'll get used to the device. And remember      that the critters always seek out the highest ground for      rest and sleep. If you place the "milking parlor" on a      rise, your sheep will trot right home to it at the end of      the day. And <em>never</em> use the milking stanchion to      immobilize the ewes when you shear them or pare their      hoofs. Such carelessness can make your sheep associate the      stand with unpleasantness, and they'll refuse to let down      their milk when near it.    </p>        <h3>PREGNANCY</h3>       <p>      During pregnancy the ewe's bag becomes larger and      wool-covered, and the lady resembles a ram from the rear,      discouraging aggressive behavior from any males in your      flock. A ewe's udder will become obviously swollen shortly      before delivery and-if it becomes engorged with      milk-will need to be treated with bag balm and      massaged. This congestion might happen often if the animal      is being overfed (particularly with grain). The sheep is      what is called an "efficient converter"-of grain into      milk-but <em>overfeeding</em> a ewe during pregnancy      can cause engorgement <em>and</em> a fat fetus (resulting      in a more difficult birth).    </p>    <p>      The udder of a breeding ewe is as large as that of a goat,      though it appears to be smaller because of the sheep's      stocky anatomy, bulky fleece and shorter teat. Because of      the lanolin which keeps the wool waterproof, sheep tend to      stay oily and collect dirt. All the fleece around the bag      and dock should be clipped before lambing. This one      shearing will probably keep the wool short enough for      milking throughout the five-plus months a ewe is      productive.    </p>         <h3>LAMBS</h3>        <p>      A newborn lamb, like baby goats and cows, will butt mamma's      bag as it looks for milk, apparently stimulating the ewe to      let down the liquid. The teat is just a funnel.    </p>    <p>      Lambs may be weaned to reconstituted cow's milk from a      weaning bottle or bucket at about three weeks of age. They      must always be allowed to have the colostrum (or first      milk) though, because it is rich in protein and provides      them with antibodies and other safeguards. If you're      unlucky enough to have a ewe that rejects her newborn, you      must extract the colostrum by hand and feed it to the lamb      yourself (by force if necessary).    </p>          <h3>MILKING EWES</h3>      <p>      Before milking a ewe, you should examine the udder for      flaws . . . a missing teat from careless shearing, a sore      or extra teats (sheep usually have two and sometimes three      or four). Because of an interesting camouflage of mutton      anatomy-the udder is normally invisible when the      sheep is standing-you will have to tip the ewe into a      sitting position to examine her bag. Treat a lumpy, swollen      or scratched udder with bag balm or hot compresses.    </p>    <p>      The udder should be washed very carefully with soap and      warm water before milking. And-if you're up to      crooning a few stanzas of "Home on the Range" or      whatever-you'll find that sheep are so responsive to      music it can be a great boon in conditioning them to being      milked.    </p>    <p>      With all this in mind, you're ready to anchor a bucket with      your feet and sit on a stool beside your ewe. It takes      about 20 minutes to milk a sheep, so make yourself      comfortable unless you want a tired back. Use a strainer or      filter to keep dust from falling into the pail.    </p>    <p>      Because the teats of the ewe are shorter than those of cows      or goats, some practice is required to compress the areola      at the base of the teat where it meets the bag. Simply      pulling on the teat will yield little or no milk. . . and      will annoy or even hurt the animal. The areolae feel lumpy      and are found in a circle in the gland just above the teat.      Massage the bag while you're getting the feel of things.    </p>    <p>      Other "rules" are similar to the ones followed in milking      cows or goats. (In some parts of the world, in fact, there      is no distinction made in treatment of goats and sheep      because they are such near relatives.) If the ewe crouches,      grab the milk bucket and resume milking only after she has      finished relieving herself. A ewe will urinate both when      she's nervous <em>and</em> relaxed. If you're handling her      right, she's going to be relaxed . . . so be alert! When      you've got a full bucket of milk, chill the fluid      immediately (and pasteurize it if you like).    </p>    <p>      The milking ewe must be thoroughly stripped out twice a day      in order to keep up her production after her newborn lamb      is weaned. The mother should also receive a dietary      supplement such as alfalfa hay, calf's manna or grain with      molasses to keep her healthy through the next five months.      Discontinue milking at least two weeks before breeding in      the fall, but continue the rich diet. Remember to taper off      the frequency of milking gradually . . . and keep watch for      signs of udder engorgement. Congestion during this period      requires massage with bag balm (and, perhaps, the      withholding of drinking water if the weather isn't too      warm).    </p>        <h3>"IS THATTA EWE, MAMMA?" <em>YEA-A-A-A</em></h3>    <p>      The amazing thing to us is that sheep's milk is so seldom      used in the United States. It's excellent in quality, mild      in flavor (somewhere between cow's and goat's milk, with      less aroma than the latter) and is produced in generous      quantity. Furthermore, woollies often drop and nourish      twins and triplets which double their weight-from 10      or 12 to 20 or 24 pounds-when fed on milk alone. The      best Greek feta and kasseri cheeses are made from sheep's      milk, and yogurt from ewe's milk is not only delicious but      thick enough to slice with a knife. It is no surprise that      the docile sheep-with its fourcrop      plenitude-represents peace, prosperity and well-being      to Mediterranean farmers.    </p>
