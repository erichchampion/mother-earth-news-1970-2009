                         <p>      <strong>SEATTLE ENVIRONMENTALIST DOUGLAS SCOTT</strong>      wants to name each reeking oil spill that befouls      Washington State's shoreline in the future... after one of      the state legislators who recently voted to let petroleum      tankers into Puget Sound!    </p>    <p>      <strong>DESPITE THE SMALL AMOUNT OF RELIEF OFFERED TO      FARMERS</strong> by a few late summer rains this year's      scant moisture and blistering heat has taken its toll      throughout the Midwest. The U.S. Department of Agriculture      now estimates 1974's corn crop at only 4.96 billion bushels      ...12% below 1973's 5.64 billion bushels and near two      billion bushels less than the USDA's spring forecast. As a      result, look for higher beef and pork prices next year and      pressure on the federal government for export controls on      U.S. grain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LAND PRICES</strong> -at least the prices of      large tracts near North Carolina's Smoky      Mountains-are suddenly softening after years of      steady hikes. The reason? Speculators who have insanely bid      up such property in hopes that they could eventually      subdivide it and cover the lots with condominiums and ski      reports now find that the necessary financing simply isn't      available. So-in the middle of continued general      inflation-we have an isolated case of deflating      values. Look for such spot disruptions in your area.      Perhaps that farm you want isn't out of reach after all!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRESIDENT FORD</strong> means well and, of course,      everyone in the nation hopes that he can pull an economic      miracle rabbit out of his hat. But don't count on it.      Economics is one of Ford's weakest subjects, former      Presidents Johnson and Nixon have left the U.S. dollar      completely drained of any "hard" backing, the world      monetary situation daily reaches new heights of confusion      and changing weather patterns (coupled with ever-rising      population and demand for food and fiber) point only to      compounded shortages and disruptions in the near future.      The tough times-on a global scale-are not: over      and there's little Ford, or anyone else, can do about it.      In this country, look for more inflation, rising      unemployment, stopgap government "cures" that generally do      more harm than goo, and other economic ills during the      coming months,    </p>    <p>      <strong>STOCK UP NOW ON ANTIFREEZE:</strong> Its main      ingredient-ethylene glycol-is in short supply      (because manufacturers can make more money selling it to      the polyester fiber industry). Result: The $1.75-$2.50      antifreeze of last year will soar to $4.00 or more this      coming winter... if it's available at all.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ALBERT E. SINDLINGER ,</strong> who circulates a      private letter to 300 ultra-plush subscribers (U.S. Trust      Co., General Motors, the White House), has-for the      first time in 26 years-bluntly predicted a      depression, according to New York magazine. "By the first      half of 1975," says Sindlinger, "we could have 8 to 9%,      unemployment, big salary cuts and a crash in the stock      market." Sindlinger, b the way, has taken his own words to      heart and sold all his personal stock holdings and put the      cash he received in a safe-deposit box. He says, "I'd be a      damn fool if I didn't." Sindlinger, of course, is not      alone. David Rockefeller, President of Chase Manhattan Bank      (one of the most important in the world), forecasts "at      least a few bank and industrial failures in the next six      months" and "the possibility of a panic".    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WAY WE SEE IT:</strong> As Paul Ehrlich pointed      out in MOTHER N0. 28, this is a good time to sever every      unnecessary tie that might prove uncomfortable when and if      the worst comes to pass. Stock up on food, simplify your      needs, learn to do more for yourself, become more      self-sufficient. But then, that's good ac anyway...isn't      it?    </p>
