                <p>      Acorns: The Grain That Grows on Trees    </p>        <p>      <em>Once you've gathered (and sampled!) acorn harvests for      a season or two, you might want to plant a food tree in      your own yard. By propagating local stock, you'll be able      to grow varieties that are well suited to your soil and      climate and that may be difficult to purchase.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The first step in planting an oak is to select</em>      <em>large, well-formed, healthy acorns from your</em>      <em>favorite parent tree. Experience in gather</em> <em>ing      the nuts for eating will help you in this</em> <em>respect,      as you'll be able to recognize a suit</em> <em>able seed      simply by its sheen, color, and feel.</em> <em>Discard any      acorns that sport worm holes</em> <em>or are discolored,      and remove the caps from</em> <em>good nuts soon after you      harvest them.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACORN STORAGE</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Fall is the preferred time for planting acorns, as many      cold-climate oaks require a</em> stratification      period- <em>that is, the nuts must remain at      temperatures just above freezing for at least six weeks,      and perhaps as long as 20 weeks, in order for the nuts to      germinate. However, if you intend to store the seeds for      planting at a later date, you can stratify them yourself:      Set the kernels in a moist planting medium such as sand,      peat moss, vermiculite, or sawdust and place them in cold      storage. The acorns</em> <em>of</em> <em>the white oaks are      generally viable for a month or two after ripening, while      those</em> <em>of</em> <em>the black oaks are viable for      six months or more. Drying the acorns to 60%</em>      <em>of</em> <em>their initial fresh weight and then keeping      them in cold storage (35-40°F) can lengthen the      viability</em> <em>of</em> <em>white oak acorns to about      eight months, and similar treatment might further extend      the viability</em> <em>of</em> <em>black oak acorns, as      well.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANTING</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Once you've collected your acorns, or received a      supply</em> <em>of</em> <em>nuts from one</em> <em>of</em>      <em>the firms listed in the accompanying editor's note,      you'll need to decide on a propagation method.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Chances are that your acorn cache will be limited, so      you'll probably want to grow seedlings in seedbeds, flats,      or containers before setting them out in their permanent      location. You can even germinate the acorns before planting      them in their "nursery" area.</em> To do so , <em>place the      nuts about 1</em> " deep in a plas <em>tic bag filled with      moist, sterilized potting medium and store the package at      50-75°F. The acorns should sprout in a few weeks. When      the sprouting root is 2-3° long, transfer the tiny tree      to a deeper container or seedbed.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Seedbeds.</strong> Planting acorns in seedbeds      is quite easy, especially if the timing</em> <em>of</em>      <em>the seedlings' growth allows them to be transplanted      directly into their permanent ground. This propagation      method is not recommended for evergreen oaks, but it works      fine for deciduous species.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Flats.</strong> Growing the seedlings in flats      is more labor-intensive than seedbed planting because the      small trees must be transplanted more frequently so that      the roots don't become tangled. Use flats that measure 4"      deep or more; if possible, they should have screen bottoms      to allow for adequate drainage and to encourage      air-pruning</em> <em>of</em> <em>the roots.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Containers.</strong> Starting your acorns in      containers is a good method</em> <em>of</em>      <em>propagation if you plan on growing only a few trees. A      pot at least 2" X 2" X 8" deep is required (gallon vessels      work well and are easy to locate). Trees intended for arid      areas should be grown in even deeper containers to      encourage taproot growth.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>TRANSPLANTING</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>The seedlings should be transferred to larger pots      before they become root-bound. Because the roots typically      grow much faster than the stem, this problem may occur      before a great deal</em> <em>of</em> <em>aboveground growth      is apparent, so keep close tabs on the progress</em>      <em>of</em> <em>your seedlings. And, as when transplanting      any crops, gradually harden</em> <em>off</em> <em>the      plants before the move and minimize the shock</em>      <em>of</em> <em>transplanting by setting the repotted      plants in a partially shaded location and by keeping them      moist.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Transferring the seedlings to their</em> permanent      <em>home should be done when conditions favor growth.      Spring is usually an ideal time, but if the autumn rainfall      is more reliable in your area, you might opt to plant your      young trees in the early fall. Again, harden</em>      <em>off</em> <em>the seedlings by reducing water and      nutrients and gradually exposing them to outdoor      conditions. Supplemental watering during the first year or      two will ease your trees' adjustment to their new home</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW THEY'LL BEAR</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Acorn production begins three years after</em>      <em>planting for some oaks, and may take considerably</em>      <em>longer for others. As with pecans</em> <em>and other      nut crops, acorn yields often</em> vary <em>from year to      year. This adaptation, known</em> <em>as predatory      sanitation, enables trees to prod</em> <em>uce extremely      high yields in boom years</em> <em>(thus ensuring that      enough acorns will survive</em> <em>rodent and insect      losses), while the low</em> <em>yields in bust years reduce      the insect populations</em> <em>and contribute to the      decline of other</em> <em>predators, as well.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Insects, fungal diseases, and pollutants can      substantially reduce acorn yields. Although pesticides are      sometimes used to combat infestations, especially in urban      areas, many diseases can be eradicated only by destroying      the infected tree. For that reason, prevention is by far      the best policy. To promote tree vigor, match oak species      with their preferred habitat ...make certain that      sufficient water, nutrients, sunlight, and space are      available ...avoid accidental injury to the tree (such as      cuts, bruises, or broken limbs) ...encourage natural insect      and disease controls as much as possible ...and remove and      destroy fallen fruit and prune dead or infected limbs from      your trees. In the event that chemical controls</em> do      <em>become necessary, check with your state's forestry      department or with the nearest office of the U.S.      Department of Agriculture Forest Service for      information.</em>    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If you prefer to grow your seedlings from      commercially available cultivars, the following firms      should be able to help you out. The seed catalogs are free      unless otherwise noted, but-as always-we ask that you send      along a dollar or two with your request,to help cover      mailing costs.    </p>    <p>      Smith Nursery<br />      Box 515<br />      Charles City, IA 50616    </p>    <p>      Redwood City Seed Compare<br />      P.O.
