                    <p>      <strong>THE AVERAGE GROSS SALARY EARNED BY A FULL-TIME      CHIMNEY SWEEP</strong> is $31,494, according to a survey      conducted at the National Chimney Sweep Guild's 1983      convention by Wood 'n Energy magazine (P.O. Box 2008,      Laconia, NH 03247; annual 12-issue subscription, $24). The      study also showed that sweeps work hard to make that money:      During the fall and early winter, the typical soot-scrubber      works just under 57 hours a week ... and many respondents      listed weekly totals in the 80's and 90's. Sweeps seem to      be a self-sufficient lot, too: 79% cited independence (not      money) as the major reason why they chose to become sweeps      ... more than one-fourth of those surveyed said they work      alone .. and 6.9% are husband-and-wife teams!<br />      <br />      <strong>THE NATION'S FIRST UNDERGROUND HYDROELECTRIC POWER      PLANT</strong> has been built in a ten-story-high chamber,      1,000 feet beneath the Sierra National Forest in      California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Water from nearby      Courtright Lake flows three miles over a declining      below-ground spillway ... plunges 1,500 feet down a      vertical tunnel into the facility's turbines ...and then      flows out of the mountain to Lake Wishon, three-quarters of      a mile away. During off-peak hours, the turbines are      reversed and pump the liquid back to Court-right Lake, so      that the power-producing process can be repeated the next      day.<br />      <br />      <strong>BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, ONLY 52% OF ALL CARS      WILL RUN ON GASOLINE</strong> , say engineers for      Volkswagen of West Germany, while 23% will use methanol,      15% diesel, 6% liquefied petroleum gas, and 3.5% ethanol      from biomass. Furthermore, they predict that the steel      content of autos will decline from the current 79% to 50%      by the year 2000. Plastic and aluminum body parts, along      with ceramic engine components, will replace the more      conventional material.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE HIGH PRICE OF NUCLEAR POWER WILL SOON CAUSE      FURTHER SUBSTANTIAL RATE HIKES</strong> in many parts of      the country, according to a survey of regulatory, utility,      and state officials conducted by the trade weekly Energy      User News. Construction delays, budget overruns, and safety      problems were cited as the primary reasons behind the      anticipated increases. Some examples: The expected      completion of Pennsylvania Power & Light Company's      second Susquehanna reactor may boost power costs by as much      as 22% ... Louisiana Power & Light is seeking a 51%      hike ... Kansas Gas & Electric Company has proposed a      five-year plan that would raise rates 39.5% in 1985 and      between 8.5 and 10.2% in each of the ensuing four years ...      and Union Electric Company in St. Louis has filed for a 70%      cumulative increase over a five-year period.<br />      <br />      <strong>IS MAGMA AN ENERGY SOURCE OF THE FUTURE?</strong>      The Department of Energy (DOE) and Sandia National      Laboratories in New Mexico are studying the feasibility of      an ambitious plan to tap into the earth's magma-the      molten rock within our planet's interior-to extract      thermal energy. According to the U.S. Geological Survey,      the energy potential of magma within six miles of the      earth's crust in this country is 800 to 8,000 times greater      than current annual energy use. The idea: Bore into the      material (the temperature of which ranges between 1,500 and      2,000Â°F) and use the heat to convert water or other      liquids to turbine-turning steam or gas.<br />      <br />      <strong>"CHEAP" DIESEL FUEL MAY BE COSTLY IN OTHER      WAYS</strong> , according to testimony delivered by Bob      Yuhnke of the Environmental Defense Fund before the House      Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. Yuhnke cited a      study showing that diesel truck drivers got 11.9 times more      urinary tract cancer than a control group ... and 7.2 times      more cancer than drivers of gas-powered trucks. The study      also revealed that railroad workers exposed to diesel fumes      contracted 42% more respiratory cancer than a control      group. Since diesel autos emit 80 to 100 times more      particulates than their petrol-driven counterparts, experts      are concerned about the consequences of a proliferation of      the cars. "If driven in sufficient numbers," said Yuhnke,      "diesel vehicle emissions could soon rival cigarettes and      drunk drivers as one of the nation's most serious threats      to public health."<br />      <br />      <strong>IN 1982, THE NATION'S TOP 150 UTILITY COMPANIES      OVERCHARGED CUSTOMERS $5.1 BILLION</strong> for federal      income taxes that the firms never paid. That amount is in      addition to the $3.7 billion the companies overcharged in      1981 (see MOTHER NO. 85's Energy Flashes). A law adopted by      Congress in 1969 allows a utility to charge ratepayers for      tax expenses without first figuring in the many tax breaks      such a company receives. As a result, the utilities now      have about $34 billion in "deferred tax" funds collected      over the years ... "the equivalent of $405 for every U.S.      household," according to the Environmental Action      Foundation (Suite 731, 1346 Connecticut Ave. N.W.,      Washington, DC 20036). Representative Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)      has introduced "The Phantom Tax Reform Act" (HR 4923) in an      effort to relieve consumers of the burdensome overcharges      ... but the bill faces stiff opposition by the electric      companies and their trade association, the Edison Electric      Institute.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>163,383 SOLAR ENERGY      SYSTEMS WERE INSTALLED IN THE U.S. LAST YEAR</strong> ,      according to a study funded by the Department of Energy.      That's an increase of 33% over 1982 .... 9.2 MILLION CARS      IN BRAZIL NOW RUN ON A BLEND OF 20% ETHANOL IN GASOLINE,      indicating the success of that country's national program      to develop biofuels .... A $7 BILLION HYDROELECTRIC POWER      PROGRAM IS UNDERWAY IN ALASKA. The project is intended to      relieve the state-and its remote communities in      particular-from heavy reliance on fossil fuels ....      In an effort to curb the environmental destruction caused      by acid rain, CANADA HAS LAUNCHED A PROGRAM TO REDUCE ITS      SULFUR DIOXIDE EMISSIONS BY 50% WITHIN A DECADE. Citing a      "need for more research," however, the Reagan      Administration has refused to act in kind.<br />    </p>
