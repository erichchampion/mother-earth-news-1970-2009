            <p is="issue">      Issue # 89 -September/October 1984    </p>              <p>      <em>In the interest of promoting one of humankind's better      ideas-barter-we announced in issue 37 our      still-standing offer: Send us a short account of an actual      barter (write to Successful Swaps, THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS(restricted), 105 Stoney Mountain Rd., Hendersonville, NC      28791), and if we print</em> <em>it in this column you'll      receive a year's subscription (new or extended) to      MOTHER.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Likewise, if you now operate, or have ever operated, a      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us about it in approximately 500 words (write      to Bootstrap Businesses, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), 105      Stoney Mountain Rd., Hendersonville, NC 28791). Be sure to      mention how you started your enterprise-including how      much seed money you needed-the amount you make (net),      and anything else that might be of assistance to other      entrepreneurs. If your story is used in this column, you'll      receive a free</em> two-year <em>subscription to      MOTHER.<br /></em><br />      Every Christmas I seem to get clothes that just don't fit      or that aren't my style. I never know what stores they came      from and usually don't want to bother with exchanging them      anyway.    </p>    <p>      Then one day I discovered that some of the other guys at      work had the same problem. As a result, we got together in      the parking lot on our lunch break and swapped all our      unwanted wearing apparel!    </p>    <p>      O. H.<br />      Arkansas    </p>          <p>      My successful barter evolved from a serious illness which      kept me bedridden for three months. About all I could do      with my time was crochet and read, and you can imagine what      it would have cost to keep me in books and yarn!    </p>    <p>      However, the problem was solved when several of the nurses      became interested in my handiwork... and especially in      learning how to duplicate it. We soon worked out a swap:      lessons in knitting and crocheting in exchange for books      and yarn.    </p>    <p>      By the end of eight weeks, eight nurses had mastered      crocheting (three of those also learned to knit), and I had      40 books... as well as enough yarn for five full-size      afghans, two crib blankets, and a crocheted bedspread. Not      only were the participants in this swap pleased, but so      were the recipients of the gifts I made.    </p>    <p>      J. S.<br />      Tennessee    </p>    <p>      After reading my first issue of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted)      (No. 78), I was inspired to make a swap of my own. My      neighbor had pastureland that needed clearing and fencing,      and I was in the market for lumber. I offered to clear the      land and build the fence in exchange for all the leftover      lumber.    </p>    <p>      Now my friend has a fenced pasture, and I have a new home      (built with the help of an article on log cabin      construction, also in No. 78), plus a large woodpile in my      backyard.    </p>    <p>      S.C.<br />      Ohio    </p>          <p>      I'm a self-supporting col lege student, and in the past I      was always in need of part-time work, which was usually      limited to the minimum wage and to late-night hours. I had      thought about starting a bootstrap business like those I'd      read about in MOTHER, but I didn't know what my enterprise      should be, until the following incident occurred.    </p>    <p>      Two years ago, a friend who is a real estate agent with a      local company complained about ripping his suit jacket      while attempting to put up a for sale sign at one of his      listings. When I heard this, the gears began to turn in my      head, and one week later I presented my business idea to      the real estate agency's office manager. I would store all      the agency's for sale signs in my garage and do the dirty      work of putting them up and taking them down as the agents      requested. I already had a mini-pickup, and I could also      use a small station wagon to transport the signs. The      office manager was delighted with my plan, and we agreed      upon a payment of $2.00 each time I either put a sign up or      took one down.    </p>    <p>      My business has continued to build steadily over the past      two years, and I've averaged $300 per month for about 1-1/2      hours of work a day, five days a week. In addition to      putting up signs, I've begun repairing, cleaning, and      painting homes listed by the agency. The work fits right      into my time schedule, and best of all, I'm my own boss.      I'd encourage other MOTHERreaders to start a      sign-transporting business where they live!    </p>    <p>      D. E. W.<br />      Colorado    </p>          <p>      When my husband was jobless last year, we increased our      efforts to cut back on basic expenses. One day, while      shopping at the local farmers' market, I noticed that the      two young children of the woman I buy eggs and milk from      were bored and cranky. I asked the busy mother if she could      use a baby-sitter.    </p>    <p>      Every Saturday since then, I have come home from the market      with all the eggs, milk, butter, cream, chicken, and lamb      we can use, <em>and</em> with two little girls who spend      the day playing with my son while their mother sells the      family produce in peace!    </p>    <p>      J.F.<br />      Alberta, Canada    </p>          <p>      One day during my sophomore year in high school, my brother      brought home an old, green, wooden duck punt he had      received as payment for repairing an elderly couple's car.      (A punt is a lightweight, shallow-water, flat-bottom boat      with a square stern.) He wasted no time trying it out on      the local stock ponds and soon cleaned out the bluegill      holes.    </p>    <p>      That fall I needed a boat to run my trapline on Cadron      Creek, so I traded my old .22 rifle to my brother for the      punt.<br />      <br />      Not long after that, one of our buddies decided he was      missing out on the fun, so he gave me $10 and five rabbit      traps for the craft.<br />      <br />    </p>          <p>      I then made enough money selling wild rabbits (and from      various odd jobs) to purchase a secondhand motorcycle      <em>and</em> to buy back the punt for $17 later that year.    </p>    <p>      Another friend who was looking for excitement that summer      had heard the legend of the duck punt. He gave me $25 and      three prizewinning Red Satin domestic rabbits in exchange      for the vessel... and I, in turn, bought feed and built      cage with the cash and soon had lots of bunnies, which I      sold for $5 to $7 each.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the old boat met its end that summer on      Crashing Rock in the swift waters of the Cadron, but none      of us will ever forget the extra income, valuable      experience, and fun that the punt provided.    </p>    <p>      B.B.<br />      Arkansas<br />    </p>
