                        <p>        <strong>Safety, Selection, Milling, and        More!</strong><br />      </p>      <p>        Stopping By Woods<br />        Chain Saw Safety<br />        Chain Saw Sense<br />        Chain Saw Lumber Mill<br />        Chain Saw Mini-Mills      </p>      <p>        <em>There's no shortage of excellent reference        publications dealing with every aspect of chain saw use        and safety ...and we've collected a few of our staff's        favorites to share with you.</em>      </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      Reading to Sharpen Your Chain Saw Skills    </h2>    <p>      Here at MOTHER's digs we fondly refer to <em>Barnacle      Parp's Chain Saw Guide,</em> by Walter Hall, as      <em>"the</em> chain saw book," or "the classic." It is      both. Originally published back in 1977 by Rodale Press,      this fine instruction manual has been out of print for some      time now. But not long ago we happened to speak with the      author, and the upshot of that fortunate conversation is      that THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>Y has agreed to publish      <em>Barnacle Parp's New Chain Saw Guide.</em> The new      version will be larger, more comprehensive, and better than      ever ...but it won't be available for some months yet, and      the initial printing may not meet the built-up demand for      this fine title. If you'd like to reserve a copy (or      copies), send us your name and address, along with the      number of books you'd like us to hold for you. As soon as      the guides start rolling of the press, we'll send you      complete ordering information. Direct your reservations to      Mother's Bookshelf(restricted) (the address is in the listing that      follows).    </p>    <p>      Another fine all-purpose chain saw guide is Robert A.      Ouellette's <em>Chain Saws: Buying, Using, Maintaining,      Repairing</em> (1981 from Tab Books, Blue Ridge Summit, PA      17214). The title reflects the contents of this      comprehensive 144-page paperback. (One of our technically      disoriented editors calls this one "the book that finally      got it through my head how :o sharpen chain-saw chain!") If      you can't find <em>Chain Saws</em> at your : local      bookstore, you can order 't for the cover rice of $6.95,      plus <em>· t</em> 50 handling for one or two copies,      or $2 °b Three or more, from Mother's Bookshelf, _ 05      Stoney Mountain Ru. Hendersonville, NC ',8791. <em>Chain      Saws</em> is copiously illustrated with photos and      drawings.    </p>    <p>      The next five publications we'll discuss here all hail from      the McCulloch chain saw rocks, and can-)e ordered by      writing to the advertising Dept.; McCulloch Corporation,      °.O. Box 92180, Los Angeles, CA 90001)    </p>    <p>      First there's Your <em>Chain Saw,</em> by Robert Scharff      (154 pages, hardbound, 1980), which is a nice little guide      to using a chain saw for cutting firewood; it includes      operation and safety tips, maintenance information, and a      section on do-it-yourself chain saw crafts projects. Your      <em>Chain Saw</em> is $7.95 from the above address.    </p>    <p>      The next McCulloch offering is <em>Firewood and Your Chain      Saw</em> by Robert Scharf (176 pages, hardbound, 1981),      which is an easy-reading guide to choosing, cutting, and      seasoning firewood, with sections on safety, firewood      burning, and the selection and maintenance of woodstoves.      <em>Firewood and Your Chain Saw</em> is $7.95.    </p>    <p>      <em>Creative Chain Saw Projects,</em> by Robert Scharff      (who seems to be McCulloch's number-one chain saw writer),      offers step-by-step instructions for a variety of chain saw      carpentry projects-including log structures, furniture,      yard and garden projects, and hints on selecting,      finishing, and preserving wood. <em>Creative Chain Saw      Projects</em> goes for $7.95 (160 pages, hardbound, 1981)      from McCulloch.    </p>    <p>      "McCulloch's Guide to Firewood Cutting on Public Lands" is      a <em>free</em> brochure covering firewood characteristics,      safety, public access to firewood, heating with wood, and      both state and national directories of where to write to      obtain firewood-cutting permits. For the price, it's most      certainly a bargain.    </p>    <p>      And for the final offering from McCulloch, you might be      interested in sending for a free "Chain Saw Safety and      Preventive Maintenance" brochure. The basics of safety and      maintenance are detailed in a series of comical drawings.      Though this little publication is far from being an      all-encompassing manual on its two topics, again, the price      is right.    </p>    <p>      <em>Chainsaw Lumbermaking,</em> by Will Malloff (The      Taunton Press, 5 2 Church Hill Rd., Box 355, Newtown, CT      06470, 1982), is a largeformat, hardbound, 213-page tome      available at bookstores, or from the publisher for the      cover price of $22.95 postpaid. Author Melloff spent three      decades as a professional logger and some 20 years      developing and refining the chain saw lumber-making      procedures he describes in this monumental reference work.      The price keeps us from recommending this one to the casual      chain saw miller. But if you're planning to build a cabin      or other large structure with lumber you'll be milling with      your chain saw, then <em>Chainsaw Lumbermaking</em> quite      likely will pay back its cover price the first day of      cutting. Briefly, there are sections on saws, chain, lumber      mill attachments, winches and other log-handling tools,      felling trees, and precision and specialty milling.    </p>    <p>      And if you are considering milling your own lumber, you'll      certainly want to send for a copy of the free Forest      Service brochure titled "A Checklist for Drying Small      Amounts of Lumber" (Technical Report No. 6). Request a copy      from the Forest Service Product Laboratory, P.O. Box 5130,      Madison, WI 53705. (We've been cautioned that supplies of      this popular publication are limited, so please request      only <em>one copy. You</em> can also find information on      seasoning lumber in the article on MOM's solar kiln,      beginning on page 130 of this issue.)    </p>    <p>      Stihl, Inc., Dept. MEN, 536 Viking Dr., Virginia Beach, VA      23452, offers three chain saw savvy publications. The      "Stihl Chain Saw Safety Manual" runs 22 pages and is free.      "Sharp Advice for Chain Saw Owners" is a guide to the care      and maintenance of saw <em>chain</em> (not saws), and can      be yours from the above address for 50c which cover postage      and handling. Stihl's most interesting offering is <em>How      to Select, Cut and Season Good Firewood, by</em> John      Vivian, author of <em>Wood Heat.</em> This attractive      30page booklet is replete with drawings by Liz Buell, and      covers what the author calls "getting' :n t tie ,vood-with      Vivid', usual flair. At 500. 't = .; bargain.    </p>
