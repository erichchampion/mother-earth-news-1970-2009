                <p>      Europeans have used a fast, efficient knitting technique      for generations. Here's how it works.    </p>          <h5 id="byline">By Johanna Linch			</h5>        <p>      The first time I saw someone knitting the continental way,      I was utterly astounded. What was that woman      <em>doing?</em> And <em>how</em> ?    </p>    <p>      I learned the answers to these questions only recently,      thanks to a kind neighbor who learned to knit as a      schoolchild in Switzerland. "All our children are taught      this method," she told me, her needles clicking and      flashing rhythmically. As I watched row after row of      beautiful work cascade from her fingers, I wondered why on      earth <em>our</em> children aren't taught the European      method, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EFFICIENCY'S THE KEY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Continental-style knitting (CSK) is faster than the      American style (ASK) because it's more efficient. In CSK,      the yarn is held in the left hand, and the right needle      simply scoops the yarn through the left needle stitch to      make a new stitch. In ASK, as you may know, the yarn is      held in the right hand and is then passed around the point      of the right needle after it's been inserted through the      left needle stitch. For the ASK novice, this means that      every time the yarn needs to pass around the needle point,      the needle itself must be dropped, the yarn wrapped around,      and the needle picked up again.    </p>    <p>      Of course, as an ASK knitter gets more proficient, he or      she learns to hold onto the needle with the fingertips of      the left hand while the yarn is being wrapped ...or, in      another technique, with the tips of the right thumb and two      middle fingers while the right forefinger flips forward      like a shuttle to throw the yarn around the point of the      needle. However, for the majority of knitters, CSK will      still be faster ...simply because it's easier to scoop a      piece of yarn through a stitch than it is to pass that yarn      around the point of a needle.    </p>    <p>      In CSK the knitting is somewhat looser; consequently, the      knitter will tend to be more relaxed (but not at the      beginning, when trying to learn the skill!). The final      product, however, is virtually indistinguishable from the      ASK version.    </p>    <p>      Another facet of CSK's efficiency is that the yarn      <em>stays</em> on the left hand, even when an empty needle      is exchanged for a full one. In ASK, the yarn is usually      dropped as the needles are exchanged, and is picked up      again when the new row is started. The amount of time      involved is small, but it adds up in the course of a large      project.    </p>    <p>      It would be easier to understand the following directions      if you had needles and yarn in hand; and because there's a      good bit of movement in the right needle as you scoop the      yarn, I'd suggest you use short, moderate-size needles such      as 8" or 10" No. 9's.    </p>                                            <p>      <strong>BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Start by casting on 20 to 30 stitches. There are several      ways to cast on; I'll describe the thumb-and-finger method,      also called double cast-on.    </p>    <p>      Allowing 1" of yarn per stitch, draw off a yarn "tail." Let      it dangle for a moment while you wrap the next section of      yarn around your hand as shown (Fig. 1). Bring the yarn up      from the skein between the ring and pinkie fingers of the      left hand. Lay it across the back of your hand and, going      around the <em>outside</em> of the finger first, wrap it      once around your left forefinger. Now wrap the yarn      clockwise around your thumb, once, and bring the end over      to be pinched between the middle and ring fingers. With the      yarn in place, and your left palm facing you, insert the      point of the knitting needle up through the thumb loop.      Reach across the yarn segment to scoop, from above, the      yarn that comes from the forefinger to the thumb (Fig. 2).      Bring that yarn all the way back through the thumb loop and      pull the thumb loop off. You should now have a slipknot on      the needle. Tighten it gently. Now simply hook the yarn      with the back of your thumb, as shown in Fig. 3, and spread      the thumb and forefinger so that the needle <em>and</em>      its one stitch hang in between. Pull the needle      back-without losing the stitch!-to where its      yarn crosses above the strand going from thumb to ring      finger (Fig. 4). Reach down and scoop up that strand at the      thumb. Swing your needle to the right and over the strand      going from the forefinger to the needle. Pick it up and      scoop it back through the thumb loop. Slide the thumb loop      off, then hook your thumb behind strand A (Fig. 5) and pull      your thumb back to tighten the stitch. Continue in this way      until you have the desired number of stitches on vour      needle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KNITTING THE CONTINENTAL WAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Hold the needle full of cast-on stitches in your right      hand. Catch the yarn between the ring and pinkie fingers of      your left hand and wrap the yarn around the back of your      hand and forefinger as you did when casting on. Now grasp      the full needle with the tips of the two middle fingers and      thumb of your left hand. There should be about 2" of yarn      stretched between your forefinger and the needle.    </p>    <p>      Pick up the empty needle in your right hand and insert it      in the first loop from left to right, front to back (Fig.      6). Go <em>under</em> the yarn coming from your left      forefinger, scoop it up with the point of your right needle      (Fig. 7), and pull the yarn back through the stitch (Fig.      8). Now slip the old stitch off the left needle. You're      done! (Well, done with one stitch, anyway.) All you need to      do is repeat this procedure with every stitch on the left      needle.    </p>    <p>      When you reach the end of the row, don't drop the yarn from      your left hand: Merely exchange the full right needle for      the nowempty left needle, and continue knitting as before.      A number of experts advise slipping the first stitch from      the left needle onto the right rather than knitting it off:      This supposedly keeps the outside edge firm and prevents it      from curling. I've found, however, that this technique      doesn't work well with all patterns, and I prefer to knit      the first stitch in many projects, such as the diagonal      garter-stitch square.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TROUBLES</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the beginning, I had a hard time scooping the yarn      through the stitch. It kept getting away from me ...as did      the needles every now and again. The problem lay in the      tension: I was used to knitting ASK-fashion, fairly close      to the needle, and there just wasn't <em>room</em> in my      stitches to scoop yarn through. If this happens to you,      relax and jiggle the needles and yarn a bit to loosen      things up.    </p>    <p>      The second problem I had-and one that I admit I'm      <em>still</em> working on-was in feeding the yarn      from the skein to the needles. I find that my palms      sometimes get damp when I'm knitting, which makes it      difficult to work smoothly. To avoid the problem, I feed      the yarn over the back of my hand, as described earlier,      rather than across my palm. In this position, my pinkie      sometimes has trouble regulating the flow of yarn, with the      result that after three or four stitches, my left      forefinger is pulled up against the left needle. Practice      has improved this situation greatly-and my teacher      has no difficulty whatsoever-so if you have the same      problem, continue practicing, or else switch the yarn to      cross your palm ...whatever works best for you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PURLING</strong>    </p>    <p>      If anything, purling is easier than knitting in the      continental style. To purl, slip the yarn in front of the      left needle, then insert the right needle behind the yarn      and into the stitch from right to left (Fig. 9). Use the      left forefinger to drag the yarn down between the two      needles. With the tip of the right needle, scoop the yarn      back through the stitch, and pull the old stitch off (Fig.      10). That's it.    </p>    <p>      One knitting expert warns that the yarn must be wrapped      around the needle as directed, that is, <em>over</em> the      needle and down behind it. Wrong-way wrapping leads to      wrong-way stitches, which will be aggravating to deal with      when you reach the next row.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INCREASING AND DECREASING</strong>    </p>    <p>      I was taught to increase by knitting one stitch and then,      before pulling it off, knitting through the back of the      same stitch, this time completing the move and pulling off      the old one. Another method, sometimes called M 1 or      invisible increasing, is to pick up the strand of yarn      between two stitches, drape it over the left needle, and      knit it through the back. You'll find that the yarn should      be draped with the front portion on the righthand side;      otherwise, the maneuver won't work properly.    </p>    <p>      Decreasing is done the same way as it is in ASK: Knit (or      purl) two stitches together.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DO IT YOUR WAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Knitting, like any other skill, demands that you make some      individual adjustments according to what you can do      comfortably ...and it requires <em>practice.</em> Whether      you knit American style, continental style ...or Italian      style, which is simply ASK with the right needle tucked in      your right armpit (this works very well!) ...you have to      pick up yarn and needles and <em>do</em> it before you can      do it better. I still have a long way to go before I can      consider myself proficient, but I'm improving. And believe      me, if I can do it ...you can too!    </p>
