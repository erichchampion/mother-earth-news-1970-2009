                        <p>      Mention the name Charlie Walters to anyone involved in      natural farming, and you'll immediately hear words of      praise. Respected as a giant in the organic agriculture      movement, Charlie has stood firm in his fight to educate      and enlighten the public on the inherent evils of "toxic      rescue chemistry"-his term for the manmade molecules      of poison used by many farmers to rescue crops from insect,      fungal, and bacterial plant destroyers.    </p>    <p>      <em>Founder, publisher, and editor of the eco-agriculture      monthly Acres, U.S.A., Charlie is also a frequent lecturer      and advisor, as well as coordinator of the annual Acres,      U.S.A. convention, which brings together hundreds of      practicing advocates of natural farming to learn from one      another.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In addition, Mr. Walters is an author. His published      works on agriculture include Holding Action (1968), Angry      Testament (1969), Unforgiven (1971), The Case for      Eco-Agriculture (1975), and Parity, The Key to Prosperity      Unlimited (1982). He edited The Albrecht Papers in 1975,      and with C.J. Fenzau wrote An Acres, U.S.A. Primer      (1979).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Former MOTHER-staffer Carrie Kent recently paid a visit      to the farmboy/economist/editor in his publishing      headquarters just south of Kansas City and came away with a      clearer understanding of the dangers facing nearly every      American farmer, now and in the years to come.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> How and when did <em>Acres,      U.S.A.</em> come into being?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> I started <em>Acres</em> in 1970,      but my interest in the subject was sparked long before I      ever decided to launch my own publication. I guess I've      dealt with and worked with agriculture in one way or      another ever since I finished school with a graduate degree      in economics from the University of Denver.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT</strong> : Is economics your first love?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS</strong> : Not really. Actually, I'd always      wanted to run a newspaper, but I ended up working for      bonding houses and auditing concerns in various parts of      the country before settling back in the Midwest. I then      went to work as a publisher's assistant for a magazine in      Kansas City called <em>Veterinary Medicine</em> that's now      known as VM-SAC.    </p>    <p>      From there I went to work as an economist for a national      farmers' organization for close to seven years. And I wrote      some books while on that job. But I became somewhat      disenchanted with the organization and left it about 1970.      About that time I was writing the book <em>Unforgiven,</em>      and in the last chapters I included some statistical work      on food production technology. During the course of my      research, I discovered that we, as a nation, were      increasing the inputs of hard chemtstry- particularly      salt fertilizers-geometrically, while the food      production was only coming up slowly, arithmetically. It      looked like we were poised on the top of a curve and that      soon we were going to start down. And I thought, holy      mackerel, if this is true, then when we end the warm-wet      cycle in the weather pattern, the United States is really      going to get into some trouble!    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> So <em>that's</em> when you formed      <em>Acres, U.S.A.?</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> Yes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> You bill <em>Acres U.S.A.</em> as      "the voice for eco-agriculture," right?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> That's correct. And actually the      prefix "eco-" has two meanings: When we write about      eco-agriculture, we mean farming that's both economically      sound and ecologically sound. It's our contention that      sloppy NPK fertilization is nothing more than <em>toxic      rescue</em> chemistry-which has no place in the      environment whatsoever. It has no safe level and no      tolerance level. We fail to acknowledge this because we      ride along on what Rachel Carson called the "Stone Age      mentality" of what constitutes toxicity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> How do the "experts" define      toxicity?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> Well, they use a principle called      the LD 50 or LC 50 factor. LD 50 means that a suspected      poison is tested on the basis of how many units of toxin it      takes per unit of body weight to kill <em>50%</em> of the      test animals. LC 50 stands for lethal concentration and is,      for example, applied in the case of aquatic life. But this      blunt measure of toxicity is seriously flawed. Let me give      you an example. Captan is a mild fungicide that's used on      apple trees. According to the LD 50 scale, it's not as      toxic as common table salt. Captan will never directly kill      you, whereas table salt can, if ingested in a large enough      dose. But that doesn't reflect the whole story. It doesn't      tell you what happens to the gene pool. Captan happens to      be a member of the <em>phthalimide</em> family and is      structurally similar to thalidomide. It's      teratogenic-which means that it deforms fetuses. It      causes what I call "scrambled kids." Records show that in      1950, when we had just begun edging into the real chemical      era, there were only 20,000 deformed children born in the      U.S. By 1970 that statistic jumped to 550,000. What's sad      is that everything in society today seems to be tested for      safety in terms of, did you make it to the door? In other      words, if it doesn't kill you <em>outright,</em> it doesn't      hurt you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> That sounds pretty ominous.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> What's even more frightening is      this: There's a scientist by the name of Dr.Rich Penney who      served at the South Pole.He performed biopsies on penguins      down there and found DDT in every bird he examined. There's      no escaping the damage that has been done. The      contamination of the environment and the ecosystem has      become ubiquitous.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> How do you answer charges that      organic farming is an old-fashioned or "backward" practice?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> I reply that the advocates of      chemical additives are the ones who are backward in their      thinking! In my opinion, the state of the art of organic      farming has bypassed the philosophies that are still being      touted by these people. We aren't advocating going back to      the organic agriculture of the 1930's. We're moving to an      upland of new agriculture, using technology but hanging      onto and implementing those older sound principles.    </p>    <p>      Of course, a lot of folks on the chemical bandwagon really      believe that we're a bunch of fools who are going to starve      people to death. But we can demonstrate that under the best      of systems we have to offer, we can produce more bins and      bushels of food with a better nutritional load than      anything that they're going to come up with in the chemical      camp. Furthermore, we aren't wasting away the earth's      resources in doing so.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> In a past issue of THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS(restricted), we reported on the problems organic farmers such      as Rita and Ralph Engelken were having. [See "A New      Endangered Species," MOTHER N0. 87, page 75 and the      Engelkens interview, "Unlocking America's True Wealth,"      MOTHER NO. 84, page 16.] Can you give me your view of their      situation?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> I met the Englekens about 12      years ago. Since then, Ralph has become a sort of guru to      the whole organic farming movement. He's traveled      throughout the country, giving speeches, and has developed      a following through his exposure on television, radio, and      magazines such as yours. Their financial problem started      because he and his family accumulated a goodly amount of      medical bills from their exposure to chemicals in their      early farming days. Then several years ago a neighbor used      chemical sprays on some fields just prior to a heavy      rainstorm. The six-inch rainfall washed a lot of the toxins      down from that grower's fields into Ralph's water supply.      The Englekens lost half of their herd by death rather      promptly. The other half, aborted their calves and then      wouldn't settle back ...in other words, breed. Well, the      upshot of all of this is that, with the tremendous cattle      loss and the medical debts and probably some other things I      don't know about, they ended up going to the Land Bank,      which granted them a "work out" loan with a five-year      repayment schedule.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> And then they couldn't meet the      schedule?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> Nobody in American agriculture      could dig out of that kind of hole! In fact, every farmer      in this country is in a liquidity crisis. The irony of the      situation is that on paper farmers often show a better      balance sheet than practically any business around. But the      balance sheet is really kind of a never-never-land      statement. It shows a net worth which presumes that, if you      have to, you can sell everything you own at a moment's      notice for raw cash. Of course, this has very little to do      with the farmer's ability to survive. But that good-looking      balance sheet is constantly being shoved down the farmer's      throat. The worth of his land is up there where it has no      right to be, having been parlayed higher and higher by the      banks and by public policy in order to allow farmers to      borrow more and dig in deeper to keep agriculture      producing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> What do you think will happen to the      Englekens ...and people like them?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> As for the Engelkens, there are      several things happening already. For instance, we are in      the process of setting up the "Friends of Eco-Agriculture      Trust." We'd like to build up a fund that can provide help      in <em>many</em> situations like this one because,      unfortunately, the Engelkens aren't alone. In fact, I      firmly believe that, overall, government instrumentalities      <em>are</em> moving in and slowly plucking out farmers by      the numbers. They've been doing it that way since about      <em>1950.</em> They're wanting to get our agricultural      systems into big industrial enclaves the way they've done      in every Third World country. And you know what the      consequences of that have been: nothing short of      starvation, revolution, and war.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> Can you offer any hope for farmers?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> Oh, sure. The people who ire      farming with biologically sound systems, people who haven't      gotten lured into debt that's too deep for them to handle,      are making money, even under current conditions. For      instance, in <em>1983</em> there vas a tremendous amount of      drought in the Corn Belt, but those who practice what we've      been preaching didn't suffer from it at all. Damage from      drought and cold snaps isn't a consequence of the      <em>weather</em> so much as it is the manner in which the      crops are being produced. If we can help American farmers      to organically get their land's calcium, magnesium,      potassium, sodium, nitrogen, and phosphates in balance,      then we'll start improving the soil's tilth and getting a      recycling of the organic matter. We'll finally start living      in harmony with nature and benefiting from all the biotic      livestock that's in the soil.    </p>    <p>      The force that makes our present economy work is the      earth's raw materials. Raw materials are free revenue from      the sun. The sun puts coal on deposit, oil in the ground,      and returns <em>800</em> corn seeds where one was planted.      That's free! That's where the economy makes it! Economists,      of course, will maintain that labor is first and foremost,      but labor does <em>not</em> come first. You have to feed      labor for 16 years before it can work. No, I believe that      today's system runs on exploiting raw materials, and      production should be priced to reflect this fact.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> But how do you go about changing the      economists' collective mind?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> The only solution, in my opinion,      is to start at the grass roots level ...right down to the      children in elementary schools. I have a little daughter to      whom I've already explained some of these things, and she      understands. We're also educating readers through      publications such as <em>Acres, U.S.A.</em> and THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted), and I speak to groups a lot. Not long ago      I met with members of the Northeast Kansas Bee keeper's      Association. And although a few of them were familiar with      <em>Acres, U.S.A.,</em> 1 told them that we really, needed      to become better acquainted. They need to hear what we're      saying, and we need to know more about them, because we      have the same problem. Some 40% of the beehives in the U.S.      are poisoned every year <em>Forty percent!</em> And those      are USDA figures.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KENT:</strong> Where do you see all of this      leading?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WALTERS:</strong> We think eventually the      <em>Acres, U.S.A.</em> concept will take over. Whether that      will happen in my lifetime, I don't know. I do know that      we're growing. We've probably doubled our circulation in      the past year, and <em>87%</em> of our subscribers are      actually involved in operational agriculture. And I think      the most important contribution that we make through      <em>Acres, U.S.A. is</em> that we've developed a rationale      that's meaningful for agriculture <em>as it's structured      today.</em> We can work within the system. What's more, the      principles that we're talking about are as good for the      window box as they are for the 1,000-acre field.    </p>    <p>      I know that toxic rescue chemistry has no place in      agriculture. Without it-and given proper time,      instruction, and help-farmer could produce much more      than they are doing today, <em>plus</em> develop a      population that has a great deal more mental acuity than it      does now. What's more, it needn't hurt a single      agricultural company, because they could certainly busy      themselves producing biological aids and systems that are      sound. As it is, they are devising new ways of putting      molecules together, and the Creator never designed      offsetting entities to counteract them. And that's just      plain insanity! It's ultimately going to destroy our      civilization, if we do nothing to turn this thing around.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Those of you who are interested in sending      donations to the Friends of Eco-Agriculture Trust may do so      by writing to P.O.
