                <p>      <em>Here's a look at a few of the many groups working to      protect Planet Earth and the freedom and natural diversity      of her inhabitants.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>The following brief overviews of a dozen conservation,      environmental, and humanitarian organizations, movements,      and publications are a mere sampling-an appetizer for      the concerned-of the many deserving groups that,      taken together, may represent a movement that could prove      to be Earth's only defense against humanity's inhumanities.      If space allowed, we could continue the list almost      indefinitely, because there are a great many fine groups      out there. Please forgive us if your favorite cause isn't      represented here.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Read through the lot, and if your heart, head, and      budget allow, feel free to adopt one or more of these      movements by contributing financial or moral support.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>AKWESASNE NOTES</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Akwesasne Notes</em> is a 32-page, magazineformat,      bimonthly newspaper serving as the official voice of the      Mohawk People of Akwesasne (the St. Regis Mohawk      Reservation)-an area that spans the New York/Ontario/      Quebec borders. <em>Notes</em> has been in print for 16      years and has readers on every continent.    </p>    <p>      The Akwesasne philosophy is so broad that it's difficult to      pigeonhole. Perhaps Mark Narsisian. the <em>Notes</em>      business manager, best summarized it when he wrote, "It is      our ancient philosophy as Iroquois People that <em>all      peoples</em> of the Earth are entitled by right of birth to      exist as diverse and distinct cultures."    </p>    <p>      <em>Akwesasne Notes</em> editor Alex Karoniaktakie adds,      "We seek a world unity through cultural diversity, not      corporate conformity."    </p>    <p>      <em>Akwesasne Notes</em> is a well-written, graphically      appealing nonprofit publication concerned with furthering      the rights and assuring the dignity of indigenous peoples      worldwide. And it is dedicated to opposing the subjugation      of Planet Earth to corporate financial whims.    </p>    <p>      <em>Notes</em> won numerous journalistic honors during the      1970's and is a member of the Alternate Press Syndicate.      U.S. subscriptions begin at $8 per year; Canadian rates      start at $10. Readers who can afford it are asked to send a      few dollars beyond the price of a subscription so that the      paper can be provided free to those who can prove that they      cannot afford to pay but nonetheless wish to be a part of      the Akwesasne movement. Tax-deductible contributions (as      opposed to subscription payments) should be made payable to      Akwesasne Notes/The Youth Project.    </p>    <p>      The address is <em>Akwesasne Notes,</em> Mohawk Nation via      Rooseveltown, NY 13683.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Amnesty International (AI)-the 1977 recipient of the      Nobel peace prize-seeks the abolishment of torture      and the release of prisoners detained by governments      anywhere for their beliefs, ethnic origin, religion, or      similar unsound reasons, provided the prisoners have      neither used nor advocated violence. AI terms such persons      "prisoners of conscience."    </p>    <p>      The group's work is based on the principle of international      responsibility for the protection of human rights. Since      its founding in 1961, AI has intervened on behalf of more      than 20,000 prisoners in over a hundred countries. Since      1980, the organization has acted on 2,687 cases in 45      countries. Members send letters, cards, and telegrams to,      and on behalf of, political prisoners. Group members also      collect signatures for international petitions and raise      money to send relief-such as medicine, food, and      clothing-to prisoners and their families.    </p>    <p>      Worldwide, AI boasts 250,000 volunteers in 130 countries,      with 13,000 Americans among their number.    </p>    <p>      Those who contribute any amount to AI receive three issues      per year of AI-USA's publication <em>Matchbox.</em>      Memberships begin at $20 for an individual and $30 for a      couple; members receive <em>Matchbox</em> plus eight issues      annually of <em>Amnesty Action,</em> which highlights AI's      "prisoner of the month"-a person designated to      receive a deluge of letters and attention from AI members.    </p>    <p>      The organization also publishes books. Its latest is      <em>Torture in the Eighties,</em> available by mail for      $5.95 plus $1.00 postage.    </p>    <p>      Send membership dues, inquiries, contributions, and book      orders to Amnesty International-USA, 304 W. 58th St., New      York, NY 10019.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EARTH FIRST!</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Earth First! (always with the "!") dictum is "No      compromise in the defense of Mother Earth!" Dave Foreman,      one of the founders (in 1980) of this "nonorganization" and      editor of <em>Earth First!,</em> the movement's fine      newspaper, summarizes the group's stance:    </p>    <p>      "Our primary goal is the preservation of natural diversity.      This means the development of an ethic of `deep ecology'      (biocentrism) and the withdrawal of human industrial      civilization from vast areas (several-million-acre      preserves) of Earth's surface. Our biggest triumph to date      was the successful nonviolent blockade of, and lawsuit      against, the U.S. Forest Service's efforts to construct the      Bald Mountain logging road into the North Kalmiopsis      Roadless Area in Oregon.    </p>    <p>      "Being a non-organization, we don't have membership rolls.      We're a <em>movement:</em> Earth    </p>    <p>      First! are individuals, and each is his or her own leader.      There are no dues other than the $10 annual subscription to      <em>Earth First!,</em> our newspaper, which is issued eight      times a year, on the old European earth holidays. The paper      is primarily a forum for the exchange of ideas on      environmental activism We pay no office rent, and no one      gets a regular salary; all of our income goes into      publishing <em>Earth First!</em> and funding environmental      action. Contributions to our Earth First! Foundation are      tax-deductible, and should be sent to P.O. Box 6206, Santa      Fe, NM 87501. Subscription orders and other correspondence      should be directed to P.O, Box 26221, Salt Lake City, UT      84126."    </p>    <p>      For more insight into the history and workings of Earth      First!'s brand of environmental concern, review the Plowboy      Interview with Ed Abbey, which appeared in MOTHER N0.      87-and if you can find a copy of the December/January 1983      issue of Outside magazine, check out the article "The Real      Monkey Wrench Gang."    </p>    <p>      There can be no doubt that these men and women have the      strength of their convictions. In a very real sense, they      are heroes and heroines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL</strong> <strong>ACTION      FOUNDATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Environmental Action Foundation (EAF) and its sister      organization, Environmental Action, Inc. (a lobbying      group), publish <em>Environmental Action</em> magazine.      Their most recent coup was the disclosure last June, by EAF      economist Richard E. Morgan, that American power companies      are holding over $25 <em>billion</em> in unpaid federal      taxes collected from ratepayers during the past 30 years.      We'll let Alden Meyer, EA director, tell the rest of the      EA/EAF story:    </p>    <p>      "Environmental Action was founded in 1970 by the organizers      of Earth Day. We have been a key group in all of the      landmark environmental fights: against the SST, the B-1      bomber, and the Clinch River breeder reactor; and in      support of the Clean Air and Clean Water acts, SuperFund,      Occupational Safety and Health Act, Toxic Substances      Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and many others.    </p>    <p>      "One can join EA with a $15 membership contribution. This      brings a year's subscription (ten issues) to the highly      acclaimed <em>Environmental Action</em> magazine and an      opportunity to join EA's activist list (people who are      alerted when important environmental legislation hits      Capitol Hill), as well as tree books and resources.    </p>    <p>      "Contributions to EA are not tax-deduct ible. However, many      of our members make taxdeductible contributions to our      sister organization, EAF, which provides information and      technical assistance to individuals and groups working on      pollution and energy issues at the state and local levels."    </p>    <p>      To join, to request information about, or to make      contributions to Environmental Action, Inc. or the      Environmental Action Foundation, write to EA, 1346      Connecticut Ave. N.W., Suite 731, Washington, DC 20036.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GREENPEACE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Like Earth First!, Greenpeace deserves special admiration:      Its volunteers actually lay their freedom and lives on the      line in an ongoing effort both to protect the environment      and to draw public attention to critical ecological issues.    </p>    <p>      Greenpeace goals include a worldwide halt to the commercial      slaughter of whales, dolphins, and seals; an end to the      proliferation of nuclear weapons and the consequent      generation of nuclear wastes; the protection of endangered      species; the introduction and implementation of clean air      regulations that will result in an end to acid rain; and an      international ban on the dumping of hazardous wastes into      the oceans.    </p>    <p>      On each of these issues (and many more), Greenpeace      volunteers-operating with the financial and moral      backing of Greenpeace members and supporters in the U.S.,      Britain, France, Germany, Holland, Australia, New Zealand,      Denmark, and Canada-have made great progress.      Greenpeace even has its own "eco-navy"-including      everything from a fleet of inflatable rubber boats up to a      converted minesweeper-which it deploys with skill and      daring.    </p>    <p>      All donations to Greenpeace are tax-deductible, and donors      will receive the Greenpeace <em>Examiner</em> (a quarterly      newsmagazine), along with special information mailings and      action alerts. There is no minimum donation required to      qualify as a member.    </p>    <p>      This group of dedicated environmental workers most      certainly lives up to its slogan, "Greenpeace puts itself      on the line." (How would you like to have irate whalers      fire rifles and harpoons over your head while you are in a      rubber raft, trying to disrupt their activities?) Send your      donations to Greenpeace USA, 2007 R St., Suite 300,      Washington, DC 20009.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NATIONAL PARKS AND</strong> <strong>CONSERVATION      ASSOCIATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since its establishment in 1919, the National Parks and      Conservation Association (NPCA) has been both an advocate      and con structive critic of the National Park System. (For      example, in 1982 NPCA participated in a lawsuit that forced      the NPS to remove from Mammoth Cave National Park a      facility that was polluting the cave system.) We'll let      NPCA Program Assistant Kathy Sferra take it from here:    </p>    <p>      "NPCA has worked to preserve pristine natural ecosystems in      national parks by opposing such incompatible uses as      logging, mining, sport hunting, commercial development,      dams and reservoirs, and unnecessary roads. NPCA is also      working to strengthen the Clean Air Act.    </p>    <p>      "As an example of the many NPCA successes, in 1981 we      learned that the National Park Service had been ordered by      the Reagan administration to build a case to de-authorize      at least five National Park System units. NPCA's initiative      led to oversight hearings in which Secretary Watt was      forced to back down from his de-authorization plans.    </p>    <p>      "NPCA's active members and supporters total more than      45,000. We publish a bimonthly magazine, <em>National      Parks,</em> which is designed to educate its readers on      current issues, environmental problems, and the beauty of      our country's parks. In addition to the magazine, members      receive 'Citizen's Action Guides' and `NPCAlerts' on      important issues. Dues range from $13 for students and      senior citizens to $200 for sustaining membership. Regular      associate memberships are $18. Dues in excess of $7 and all      contributions are taxdeductible."    </p>    <p>      For more information, write to NPCA at 1701 18th St. N.W.,      Washington, DC 20009.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE NATURE CONSERVANCY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since 1950, The Nature Conservancy and its 200,000+ members      have been involved in the preservation of nearly two      million acres of prime wildlife habitat in 50 U.S. states,      the Virgin Islands, Canada, and the Caribbean.      And-you may well ask-just what do they do to      "preserve" this land and its wild inhabitants?    </p>    <p>      Well, for the most part, they <em>buy</em> it. (Much is      also donated and willed to them.) We like that approach; it      could be compared to the activist tactics of Greenpeace and      Earth First!-but instead of personal, physical action, the      conservancy practices <em>monetary</em> environmental      activism. It works.    </p>    <p>      The Nature Conservancy's efforts are currently being      focused on their monumental National Wetlands Conservation      Project-a five-year, private/public effort to      conserve endangered water-related ecosystems in the U.S.      Start-up funding for the Wetlands Project was provided      through a $25 million grant from the Richard King Mellon      Foundation (the largest grant ever made by a private      foundation for conservation purposes), but the conservancy      must raise an additional $50 million in public and private      funds over the next five years.    </p>    <p>      If you wish to help, you can earmark contributions to go to      either the Wetlands Project or the General Fund (the latter      will be used to defray the organization's ongoing operating      expenses). You can learn more by writing to The Nature      Conservancy, 1800 N . Kent St., Arlington, VA 22209,      Attention: Membership Secretary. The annual dues start at      $10.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PEOPLE FOR</strong> <strong>THE AMERICAN      WAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>A censor is a man who knows more than he thinks you      ought to.</em>    </p>    <p>      - Granville Hick    </p>    <p>      Formed in 1980, People For The American Way is a      100,000-member, nonpartisan educational organization whose      purpose is to promote and protect the individual rights and      personal freedoms of all Americans. Censorship is one of      the group's main areas of concern. Executive Director      Anthony Podesta explains:    </p>    <p>      "Through mass media education campaigns and citizen action      programs, People For promotes respect for diversity among      Americans and opposes extremist proposal, that would impose      one narrow way of believing, thinking, working, and living      on all people. We are committed to the basic promise of      liberty and justice for all, individual freedom of thought      and expression, religious liberty and separation of church      and state, support for individual and family rights, and      constitutional democracy-in short, majority rule with      protection for dissenters and minorities."    </p>    <p>      Contributions are tax-deductible and entitle you to receive      the <em>Quarterly Report,</em> which keeps members      up-to-date on the organization's efforts. People For also      offers <em>Protecting the Freedom to Learn: A Citizen's      Guide</em> (125 pages, $9.50 postpaid), which provides      suggestions on how to support your public schools and      libraries.    </p>    <p>      People For The American Way's offices are at 1424 16th St.      N.W,, Suite 601, Washington, DC 20036.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANNED PARENTHOOD</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (PPFA)      is the nation's largest nonprofit voluntary health agency.      Its membership consists of an elected volunteer board of      directors plus 191 affiliates. PPFA is a member of the      International Planned Parenthood Federation, with member      organizations in 95 countries and headquarters in London.    </p>    <p>      Planned Parenthood provides its services through more than      700 clinics located in communities throughout the country.      These clinics offer women's health services that include      pregnancy testing, VD testing and treatment, birth control,      pelvic and breast exams, pap smears, and medical      consultation, plus premarital education, counseling, and      referral services for both sexes. Planned Parenthood      charges its patients on a sliding fee scale: The less      income a woman has, the less she pays. As a result,      thousands of people annually receive first-class diagnostic      treatment, and these are largely women who otherwise would      have to live (or die) without it.    </p>    <p>      PPFA depends on medical fees and contributions for its      financial support, and relies heavily on volunteers to      staff its programs. If you wish to volunteer your time,      make a financial contribution, or avail yourself of Planned      Parenthood services, contact the PPFA clinic nearest you.      If there is no clinic in your area, write to the Planned      Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.. 810 7th Ave., New      York NY 10019.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SEEDS</strong>    </p>    <p>      SEEDS, a hunger-relief organization that was launched in      1977, publishes a magazine with the same name. We'll let      Gary Gunder <em>son-SEEDS editor</em> and one of the      group's founders-tell you about the organization's      work:    </p>    <p>      "SEEDS focuses on informing, mobilizing, and enlarging the      community of people who respond to domestic and world      hunger. Our office is on the top floor of a church, and we      are unabashedly Christian, though many of our supporters      hold opposing worldviews; re <em>lieving hunger is our</em>      reason for being.    </p>    <p>      We publish the bimonthly magazine <em>SEEDS</em> and the      newsletter 'Sprouts'. We also put out a few      books-such as our current release, A <em>Guide to      World Hunger Organizations,</em> which advises people how      to give wisely. We offer workshops on providing shelter for      the homeless and other practical relief measures.      Everything SEEDS does offers a handle for personal response      and action.    </p>    <p>      <em>"SEEDS</em> was honored in 1982 with the first annual      Hunger Media Award for best magazine coverage of hunger      issues. We mail <em>SEEDS</em> to just under 5,000 paid      subscribers. Our readership has doubled during the Reagan      administration years-at least in part because of the      large numbers of hungry people showing up on America's      doorsteps. Our primary commitment for the coming year is to      help mobilize the scale and type of response that can end      Africa's crushing hunger crisis and help move the African      people toward the self-sufficiency they clearly would      prefer to our charity "    </p>    <p>      You can subscribe to <em>SEEDS</em> for $10 a year (222 E.      Lake Dr., Decatur, GA 30030). Contributions over the      subscription price are taxdeductible. They'll be happy to      send you a sample copy for $1.00.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SIERRA CLUB</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Sierra Club is the "biggie" of environmental groups. It      was founded by John Muir in 1892 and currently boasts some      350,000 members, 54 grass-roots chapters, 298 special      groups, 180 staff members, ten regional conservation      committees, and ten field offices.    </p>    <p>      In a letter to members, President Denny Shaffer says, "The      Sierra Club is truly a unique organization, combining      environmental lobbying, litigation, outings, book      publishing, and-most important-grass-roots      activism. The club's work is accomplished, in large part,      through the unpaid, volunteer activities of its members. In      the past two years, our membership has doubled. making the      Sierra Club the fastest-growing conservation group in the      world. This tremendous growth is a testament not only to      the club's 92-year tradition of conservation effectiveness      but also to the increased <em>need</em> for a strong Sierra      Club: The Reagan administration has challenged virtually      every program designed to protect our environment,      wilderness areas, and public health."    </p>    <p>      A complete list of the Sierra Club's achievements would      fill many more pages than we have available here. Its      current legislative priorities include the reauthorization      of the Clear Air and Clean Water acts, increasing the      budget of the Environmental Protection Agency monitoring      minerals leasing on public lands, and pushing through the      largest number of wilderness bills (30) since the      Wilderness Preservation Act of 1964.    </p>    <p>      Sierra Club membership is $29 per year and includes a      subscription to the excellent <em>Sierra</em> magazine,      plus a variety of special mailers and "action alerts,"      which are published as needed.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to add your voice to the club's, efforts,      write to the Sierra Club, 530 Bush St., San Francisco, CA      94108.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ZERO POPULATION GROWTH</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are nearly 4.8 <em>billion</em> people crowding the      world today. That figure represents a doubling since World      War II. At the current rate of growth, the global      population will double <em>again</em> within 40 years (it's      increased nearly 85 million in the last year alone).    </p>    <p>      Sound like a problem? Overpopulation is, in fact,      <em>the</em> problem of our time ...and the cause of a      majority of the world's other, lesser-by-comparison,      troubles and threats. Someone should do something about it.    </p>    <p>      And someone is trying to. Zero Population Growth (ZPG) is      now in its sixteenth year of struggling for reproductive      sanity in the world. In 1968 when population biologist and      writer Dr. Paul Erlich and a handful of other concerned      people formed ZPG, the U.S. fertility rate (the average      number of children per childbearing woman) was 2.5-or .5      above '`replacement level." By the early 1980's, the      fertility rate had fallen to 1.8 ...and ZPG played a large      role in bringing about that reduction. But today the      preponderance of teenage girls and older "baby boom" women      having children is combining with a high immigration rate      to reverse the trendmeaning that the U.S., contrary to      popular belief, is <em>not even close</em> to reaching ZPG.
