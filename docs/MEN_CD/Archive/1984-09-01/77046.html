                    <h2 id="subtitle">GARY SNYDER:</h2>		<p>		<strong>Choosing Your Place-and Making a Stand!</strong>    </p>        <p>      Gary Snyder is no stranger to longtime readers of THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>Â°. In fact, his ecological broadside      "Four Changes" actually opened MOTHER N0. 1! In later      years, a quote from Gary's work graced our Let the Men      & Women of Wisdom Speak in our tenth anniversary issue      (No. 60), and one of his poems helped kick off our      Fieldbook feature in No. 86.    </p>    <p>      Born in San Francisco on May 8, 1930, Snyder first came to      national attention, ironically enough, as the model for the      hero of another writer's book-the character Faphy Ryder in      lack Kerouac's novel The Dharma Bums (1958). His own major      publications were soon to follow, though, beginning with      Riprap (1959), reaching a peak of sorts with the Pulitzer      Prize-winning Turtle Island (which took its name from a      Native American term for North America and was published in      1974), and culminatingfor the present, anyway-with Axe      Handles, which was released by North Point Press early this      year. (Ordering information for this fine collection of      poems follows the interview.)    </p>    <p>      Through much of his work, Gary has functioned as a strong      voice for the planet and-perhaps even more significant for      the creatures of this earth that lack the means of      representing themselves in the chambers of human politics.      And in recent years his expression of such concerns has      often been in the form of comments relating to a somewhat      confusing-on the surface, at least-concept called      bioregionalism.    </p>    <p>      To find out more about this movement (if, indeed, movement      is even an appropriate term), MOTHER staffers Bruce Woods      and Dave Schoonmaker met with Gary at the headquarters of      his Berkeley publisher. In the following      interview-excerpted from their discussions-you'll learn      that bioregionalism can be as complex as the laying of a      groundwork for a new "Green politics" for the United      States, a movement that aims to rethink all of our      arbitrary political boundaries, or as simple as the urgent      message that it's time for all of us to discover where we      are and to take responsibility for the soil, water, plants,      birds, and beasts that share our locale. It's a sure bet      that all aspects and interpretations of the bioregional      concept won't appeal to every reader of this magazine, but      it's just as likely that some aspect of what Gary Snyder      has to say will touch each and every one of us.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Gary, you were among the first      contemporary North American poets to address the problems      of caring for the earth and the living creatures that share      the planet with us. Can you tell me how your background,      place of origin, and education may have pushed you in that      direction?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> I suppose that my concern is due,      at least in part, to growing up in the Pacific Northwest,      north of Seattle, in a rural environment. I was surrounded      by the second-growth forests-maybe third-growth forests-on      the hills back of my father's little stump farm/dairy farm,      and the distant, but not too distant, views of the Cascade      Mountains, Mount Rainier and Mount    </p>    <p>      Baker, and the whole range of peaks to the east ...as well      as the white, snowy ranges of the Olympic Mountains across      Puget Sound to the west. That was the world I grew up in,      and I found it exciting and beautiful and wanted to explore      it.    </p>    <p>      However, exactly why I should have focused <em>more</em> on      learning about the natural world than did a lot of other      kids I knew, is, I suppose, just some kind of karma.    </p>    <p>      Part of my youthful interest in nature was just due to one      of those imponderable aspects of a person's makeup ...and      another part of it was a result of the opportunities given      to me by the region in which I grew up. At any rate, I took      advantage of the area around me and ventured into it on my      own. I started learning, as-best I could, what was there in      the way of plants and birds, and went out and explored the      area ...staying overnight on my own sometimes in a little      secret camp, cooking for myself, and so forth. And I moved      gradually from that into taking longer and longer trips      into the Cascades and into the Olympics. By the time I was      15, I was beginning to do mountaineering and continued to      do more climbing through adolescence. I climbed all of the      big snow peaks of the West-St. Helens at 15, Hood and Adams      at 16, Rainier and Baker and Stuart at 17, and so forth.    </p>    <p>      I also became aware of the presence of the Northwest Coast      Indians, seeing them here and there around the area ...down      by the beach, in the public market. The Salish Indians even      used to come by the house, selling smoked salmon.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, I put a few things together when I was still      in my early teens, and it occurred to me that these were      the people who had always been here. And that these would      be the real teachers, if I truly wanted to learn about the      place, because they were the actual <em>residents. I</em>      mean, you can find a certain amount of information in a      bird book or a flower book, but then there's another level      of understanding that goes much deeper than that: one that      comes from real acquaintance.    </p>    <p>      I also tried my hand at a few of their skills and crafts      and did a little leather tanning, made moccasins, and made      my own tools. In short, I struggled with self-sufficiency      ...and subsistence.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Using the natural materials that      were available ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Yes, and these interests and      activities led me toward anthropology and American Indian      studies when I got into college.    </p>    <p>      "...if we had political boundaries more appropriate to the      regions in which we live-following watersheds or mountain      ranges, following plant zones and soil types-that would be      a step in the right direction, both ocially and      ecologically ..."    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> That was at Reed College, in      Portland, right? <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Yes. While I was      there, I combined anthropology with the stud of literature      and ended up concentrating on oral literature and      mythology. I was fascinated by all of the problems      associated with the stylistics of oral literature and by      the question of what is implied for us, internationally and      culturally, by the presence of mythology and folk tales,      worldwide, that have similar motifs and themes. That made a      profound impression on me and pushed me in the direction of      poetry. Then another factor began to influence my      intellectual development: the study of China.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How did you become interested in      that?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Well, first by picking up Ezra      Pound's translations of Chinese poetry. And then, later, by      reading Arthur Waley's translation of the <em>Tao Te      Ching</em> and his many translations of poetry. I was      amazed to discover that China had a high civilization, with      centuries of literacy, which has a different view of nature      than that commonly held in the West.    </p>    <p>      Essentially, I came to realize, there are at least      <em>three</em> ways of looking at things: the primitive or      indigenous ways of seeing the world ...the Occidental      civilized way ...and the Far Eastern civilized way. There      are three or more positions, rather than just the civilized      and the uncivilized.    </p>    <p>      The indigenous or "old ways" philosophy assumes an implicit      oneness and kinship with the whole of nature and sees      nature as process, rather than as a collection of      commodities. It believes in a nonlinear, nonsequential      causation that links apparently disparate events: "I didn't      get an elk this week because I spoke rudely last month." It      has no fear of wild nature and hence no thought of taming      it.    </p>    <p>      The Far Eastern view (and here I'm skipping the Middle East      and India, which I see more as mystical subsets of the      Occident) is both secular and animistic. It sees all nature      as a process (Taoism) into which a complex civilization can      fit if it practices proper etiquette on a massive scale      (Confucianism). The Occident had similar prehistoric roots      but developed a more intense urbanism, theism, and thirst      for expansion of power that lead to mind/matter dualism and      to the elevation of humankind to a totally different      category <em>outside</em> of nature.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Would you say that there is also      a difference between the nativeEuropean Occidental view and      the American Occidental view, since most of us are      essentially foreigners here?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Well, you could say that, but the      dynamics of American culture are still, I think, pretty      much European. All the tricks and games we've played were      first figured out in Europe. We iust had a new continent      upon which to employ them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> With more raw material. . .    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Right. Tocqueville talks about      that, and does so eloquently, n: his description of the      United States. In short, the primary mind-set that our      ancestors brought from Europe has not yet been broken. It's      that Cartesian dualism-of consciousness and nature, of body      and spirit, and of subject and object-that causes our whole      culture to still see this huge continent as essentially a      yard full of resources to be used for whatever purposes we      can comc up with.    </p>    <p>      We suffer from a lack of sense of nativeness ...a lack of      commitment to spending time in place, to the building of a      culture over the centuries. These concepts haven't occurred      yet to most Americans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> We're still acting as if we were      invaders rather than true residents    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Right. And, unfortunately, even      the Europeans-on their own an cestral ground-often act the      same way. Or the Japanese, too, as they go about radically      altering and reshaping their environment for the sake of      their current self defined industrial needs, with very      little thought for long-range sustainability. They're      playing the game to the hilt for <em>this</em> century and      hoping that somehow things will come out OK later.    </p>    <p>      These are huge <em>gambles-huge gambles-that</em> these      people are taking, However, the Japanese <em>are</em>      hedging their bets a little bit. One of the ways they do      this is by maintaining a highly subsidized rice      agriculture. Farmer on the northern coast, on the coast of      the Japan Sea (which is the richest rice-growing territory      in all of Japan), are subsidized to keep raising rice, even      though that production involves a loss to the economy as a      whole.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> We don't seem to be doing      anything similar to that here.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> But we are, to a degree. We      <em>are</em> subsidizing a lot of agriculture Of course, we      don't do it so much with the thought of simply keeping the      skills alive. Rather, it's done in response to the demands      of powerful political lobbies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And I gather that the subsidized      Japanese rice farmers ircr,': mining the soil to the extent      that most of our subsidized agriculture is.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> No. The indigenous rice culture is      an agriculture that has prop c n itself sustainable through      the centuries. Of course, the Japanese <em>have</em>      employed a lot of herbicides and pesticides and petroleum      fertilizer in rice farming it-, recent decades. But they      still know how to do without them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> These sorts of problems continue      to evolve. Would you say that your ideas on the most      effective courses of <em>action</em> toward environmental      concernsecological concerns-have evolved over the years?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Well, they haven't changed in      major degrees, but they have steered. you could say, by the      wind. I'm always looking for the most intelligent, the      clearest angle of approach. I'm not locked into a course of      action or a point of view. In short, I'm trying to keep      learning about the ways in which wt: look at these      questions and trying to understand what the dynamics of the      current industrial world culture and its self      destructiveness are. It's a huge undertaking to try to      figure out how it all works: One can only see a little of      this elephant.    </p>    <p>      Over the years I've kept applying myself to the study of      history and economics, just trying to understand how it is      that these few little European nations spread over the      world so rapidly. And, while doing so, I've tried not to be      too <em>judgmental.</em> It's not exactly as though we were      dealing with the force of evil against the forces of good.      It's rather more complex.    </p>    <p>      We have to understand how these huge economic and political      systems work and how to turn their energy-which is a real      and potentially <em>useful</em> energyin more healthful      directions whenever we can and wherever we can ...which.      maybe, is a point of view that-at least for some      people-takes too much patience. And maybe we don't always      have time for it. But it's certain that our effectiveness      would improve with a better understanding of all these      force; ...whenever we can get it.    </p>    <p>      To go back just a little bit, I'd like to say that although      it's true that I was among the first writers in recent      decades to focus on nature and the " wild mind," I'm not      <em>the first,</em> by any means. People who were very      important in helping me shape my ideas include Kenneth      Rexroth, who was writing very clearly on these issues, in      the late 30's ...Michael McClure, who started speaking and      writing along the same lines just about the same time I did      ...Robert Duncan, in his own way, tangentially touching on      these questions ...and Robinson Jeffers, who made clear      statements from early on.    </p>    <p>      Then again, beautiful, precise, intuitive perspectives can      be seen in the nature poems of D.H. Lawrence ...and      Lawrence's essays on American literature are profound; his      insights into its problems and psychology are      extraordinary.    </p>    <p>      So the work actually has been there all along. And prior to      my work, and the work of the other poets that I've      mentioned, were the long-held concerns of people like John      Muir. He inspired a couple of generations of      conservationists, many of whom were very fine writers. Aldo      Leopold, for example.    </p>    <p>      In fact, we have a real history and tradition of work in      the field by all sorts of cranky, intelligent, and often      very wild people ...all the way from the last century till      now.    </p>    <p>      Most poets got into the game a little bit later, but the      concern has been there all along. You can even find      nineteenth-century precedents for it. Of course, all of us      in a way go back to Thoreau ...and that trail leads back      into Europe, to the writings of anarchists and of people in      the heretical independent Christian movements, among      others.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Isn't it true that the      environmental crisis itself has escalated so much in the      last few decades that it's caught more attention from the      public?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Yes, but the direction in which      the world was going was recognized a long time ago.      Rousseau comments on it ...Edmund Burke ...Tocqueville      comments on it specifically in terms of what was then      happening in America. There have always been some eyes that      saw, with horror and amazement, where the logic of      unbridled materialism and the dualistic worldview and the      lure of endlessly available resources would lead ...when      tied to a kind of deified notion of the free-market      economy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> The bioregional movement is a      more recently emerging environmental cause and one that      you've championed lately. Could you define this term for      us?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> OK, but first I have to admit that      I don't know where the term bioregionalism first came from.      I do know, however, that it has some old and interesting      predecessors that are by no means necessarily      environmentally oriented. Part of the history of the      emergence of bioregionalism must, I think, have to do with      the completely natural-and to be expected-resistance of      local economies and local cultures to being colonized by,      and swept away by, urban cultural centers. The movement      probably has its origins in the gradual expansion of the      power of the city, or of the metropole, in European      culture-at the expense of sustainable local, small      cultures. And these local cultures, which usually have      their own languages or dialects and their own traditions,      have always resisted being swept into somebody else's      urbanized mainstream in which they would come out second,      both economically and culturally ...they would be      second-class citizens.    </p>    <p>      It's all part of the rise of the centralized state. Without      even knowing quite why they must, except out of a spirit of      sheer survival, small cultures like the Cornish, like the      Bretons, like the Welsh, like the Irish, like the Scotsjust      to give a few examples in Western Europe-have tried to hang      on through the centuries by the skin of their teeth, tried      to maintain some of their own identity.    </p>    <p>      These peoples are not only arguing for cultural      authenticity and the right to existwhich is certainly a      right-but also for the maintenance of the skills and      practices that belong with local economies and that enable      them to operate in a sustainable manner, via their own      specialized, local knowledges, over the centuries.    </p>    <p>      From one angle, then, bioregionalism stands for the      decentralization of, the critique of, the state. In part,      it draws on the history of anarchist thought: the line of      thought that argues that we do not need a state, and that      the state or government is not necessarily synonymous with      the social order and organization inherent in society. By      anarchism I mean a nonviolent political philosophy that      finds order in the possibilities of a free society, and not      in the imposed order of a state structure operating with a      monopoly on violence from above. That's what I mean by      anarchism, not the work of wild-eyed bomb throwers (to      clear up that misapprehension). So North American      bioregionalism is an extension of anarchist thought,      combined with much appreciation of American Indian culture      areas, the recognition of the virtues of decentralization,      and the insights of "field ecology."    </p>    <p>      With that in mind, we look at the web of political      boundaries thrown on this continent by the rapid history of      American expansion. Bioregionalists see them as poorly      drawn, as inappropriate. Environmental concerns then begin      to enter the bioregional perspective, saying, in effect,      that if we had political boundaries more appropriate to the      regions in which we live-followin'g watersheds or mountain      ranges, following plant zones and soil types-that would be      a step in the right direction, both socially <em>and</em>      ecologically, in that it would enable us to tune our local      societies more precisely to the natural resources that are      already in place, and to form our human communities and      associations more appropriately to the natural communities.      It's a step toward actually asserting the unity of the tree      and bird communities with the human. We all share the same      natural boundaries, you see.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And that demands our taking      responsibility for our km n area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> And that means all species taking      responsibility together.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> To give you an example of      artificial versus natural boundaries. there are the      political borders of the states of California, Washington,      and Oregon, say. In that same region, though, there are      also-among others-the natural boundaries established by the      range of Douglas fir. This type of tree grows from      somewhere just around Haines, Alaska, down the coast and      along the crest of the Cascades and the Sierra as far as      Big Sur ...and extend east to the crest of the Sierra      Nevada. It's found around where I live, but not over on the      other side into the Great Basin.    </p>    <p>      From Big Sur north to Haines, and from the crest of the      Sierra and the Cascades to the Pacific Ocean ...the range      of Douglas fir is almost exactly precise definition of what      <em>my</em> natural nation would be. The agriculture and      forestry of the region within which Douglas fir grows are      <em>defined by</em> the amount of rainfall and the      temperatures found in that zone. South of the Douglas fir      range you find a really hot and much drier, truly      <em>Mediterranean cli</em> mate, which has different      agricultural needs. And so you could take, say, the Douglas      fir-because it's dependent upon that rainfall and those      temperatures-as the <em>signature</em> of this natural      nation. And what we already know about Douglas fir tells us      nearly everything else about the locale ...including what      kind of farming we should do, what kind of raincoats we      should wear, what boots will be the best to wear, and even      what our poetry should be like. [Laughter] That's the way      those things work, you know.    </p>    <p>      I felt this on my last trip up to Alaska, when I drove from      Anchorage up around the basin of the Copper River and over      into Canada and came down through the Yukon. I turned off      at Haines Junctioh and went over Haines Summit-all of that      being white spruce taiga, still frozen in-and dropped down      then to the Pacific, to Haines, Alaska, which is on the      water. And suddenly I was in the green trees, the skunk      cabbage was beginning to come out, the eagles had already      left ...and it was spring, where 40 miles back up the road      up in the taiga I'd been in the winter of the Yukon. I knew      I was back in <em>my</em> country, seeing Douglas fir. All      of the terms suddenly changed. The plants became plants I      know.    </p>    <p>      <em>That's</em> a bioregional boundary. I could      <em>feel</em> it. And if you look at the maps in Kroeber's      book <em>Cultural and Natural Areas of Native North      America, you'll</em> find (this is exactly what he does in      that book, using a series of overlay maps), that the      natural regions of North America and its native cultural      regions are almost identical.    </p>    <p>      So in a sustainable society-one based upon its own local      resources-the political boundaries and the social      boundaries would follow the natural boundaries. There it      is.    </p>    <p>      And those of us who are now promoting bioregional      consciousness would. as an ultimate (and long-range) goal,      like to see this continent more sensitively redefined, and      the natural regions of North America=or Turtle      Islandgradually begin to shape the <em>political</em>      entities within which we work. It would be a small step      toward ecological sanity, and a larger step toward the      accomplishment of political decentralization and the      deconstruction of America as a superpower into seven or      eight natural nations ...none of which would have a budget      big enough to support missiles. It would also be a step in      the direction of amiable, intimate, face-to-face community      politics and societies ... and, ultimately, it would help      us develop sane and sustainable economies. (I think I just      gave a long answer to a simple question.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> It seems to me that having a      sense of one's own bioregion would also be an advantage in      terms of maintaining <em>personal</em> sanity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> That would certainly come with      having a greater involvement in community life and an      increased sense of power over your own world.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> I was raised in upstate New      York's "grape belt," in the foothills of the Alleghenies on      the Lake Erie coast, and later lived out in California for      years. I was never really comfortable on the West Coast,      but when my family moved to western North Carolina, in the      foothills of the Blue Ridge, all of a sudden everything      that I'd been familiar with when I was growing up-all the      plants I knew and relationships between the plants-was      almost the same again. And it's very comforting just going      out for walks in that country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Yeah. In the same way, I get the      feeling that I've never adjusted myself to deciduous      hardwoods. For me, a real forest has to be a      <em>conifer</em> forest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And I can't get comfortable with      evergreens; it's oaks and hickories for me.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Those things really stay with you      ...but they're certainly not reasons to go to war!      [Laughter] At any rate, several of us-independently,      almost-began to see the bioregional possibility as being      part of the overall work we were already involved in ...12      or 14 years ago. Allen Van Newkirk started talking about      the idea back then. And Peter Berg and his circle of      friends, plus the North Coast people (Jim Dodge and Jerry      Martien, Lynn House, Peter Coyote, and two individuals who      go by the names of Bobcat and Ponderosa Pine) have long      been comrades with me. All of us together, really, have      been exchanging ideas and thoughts about these things. Then      there's Zach Stewart, who runs the Canessa Gallery and is      an architect in downtown San Francisco. He's long been a      proponent of urban bioregionalism and a champion of the      definition of cities as part of natural regions. He did,      and probably still does, lead people on nature walks, right      down in Montgomery Street and North Beach and around in San      Francisco, showing them how natural borders still exist in      the city.    </p>    <p>      Michael McClure loves to do that, too. I suppose this would      be a good time to list some of the other active      bioregionalists. Nancy Morita has been working with Peter      and Zach on her project, which is called Wild in the City.      She's actually laid out a set of maps that show the old      pre-white habitations in San Francisco, the peninsula,      delineating what the original vegetation of the Sunset      District was, and where the salmon streams were in downtown      San Francisco, and where the deer and the tule elk were.      And she created an overlay map that allows you to lay a      modern San Francisco map on top of her chart of      <em>original</em> San Francisco to see what plants and      animals and birds used to be found where different urban      neighborhoods now are. And it's not done just as an      exercise in nostalgia. It's a way of saying that if we make      our city right, we can have these things here with us      again. That, in a sense, is the ideal. That's the dream of      all bioregional visionaries: to have human habitation      integrated with natural populations, to bring back what was      here before and to be able to <em>live</em> with it.    </p>    <p>      And we could have salmon running in Strawberry Creek right      up here on the Berkeley campus, as they used to. Or have      orcas coming into San Francisco Bay as they used to. It      could be the culmination of a future technology ...of a      postindustrial sophistication, and a refinement of      everything we know. We could have clean air and clean water      and still have-not as huge a population as we have now-but      have large and delightfully <em>diverse</em> human      populations living within it all.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> It almost makes you wonder      whether the former makeup of an area doesn't have some kind      of spiritual influence on the neighborhoods that are there      now.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> That's an interesting speculation.      I talked to an elderly Crow Indian up in Montana a few      years ago who said just that. He was an interesting man, I      guess regarded as a medicine man, and we were at a meeting      where there were a lot of younger Indian radicals and      activists. This older man said to me, kind of as an aside,      "You know, I'm not really worried about what white people      are going to do to this continent. If anybody lives here      lone enough, the spirits will begin to speak to them. It's      the power of the spirits coming up from the land," he said.      "That's what taught us, and it would teach everybody, if      they'd just stay here. The old spirits and the old powers      e: , aren't lost; they just need people to be around long      enough to begin to fluence them."    </p>    <p>      Now that may be overly optimistic, but it's an elegant      perspective. To some extent, you <em>can</em> see it      working. If people will just <em>be</em> in a place long      enough and will begin to actually say "OK, I'm here," then      they'll begin to learn.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> It relates to everything else      we've been talking about-becauÂ·t. as I understand      it, a large part of the whole bioregional concept is the      de,.sion to establish a sense of place and to then <em>get      to know</em> that place, rather than constantly moving      around and never becoming familiar with an area      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> If you don't have familiarity, you      can't learn anything    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> [Laughter] You don't get little      messages or instructions from No. jays or flickers or      white-crowned sparrows if you don't stay still a little bit      That's really true.    </p>    <p>      Now let's address the opposition's position.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Go ahead.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> When people hear this kind of rap.      the average college-educated, wellintentioned young urban      professional will say, quite honestly, "Oh, t !r,,, sounds      just great! But wouldn't it create a bunch of parochial      peasants, he might eventually become encrusted in their own      local consciousness to such h, a degree that we'd be back      with some old-style balkanization, with little tions      fighting little nations?" And I think that's a very fair      question.    </p>    <p>      In response to it, I'd say that part of what we have to see      ourselves as working toward is the balance of cosmopolitan      pluralism and deep local consciousness Local consciousness      without <em>any</em> cosmopolitanism would be a disaster:      of its own sort. But there's no reason, historically, to      think that we can't have e a degree of both. There are      plenty of examples of very diferent cultures, ';! . ing      adjacent to each other, that got along fairly decently.    </p>    <p>      What's needed, you see, is a shared <em>spiritual</em>      perspective that extends across bioregional and even      linguistic boundaries, to assure a fair level of      "peaceability." In the case of North America, say, there      was a shared respect that crossed the boundaries of the old      tribal territories, a shared perspective ::regard to the      natural world and in regard to the power of spirits, but      especially a respect for people of character, respect for      strength, honesty, generosity , ...and for personality.    </p>    <p>      Cabeza de Vaca spoke of that in his account of traveling      from Florida ;o New Mexico in the early sixteenth century.      Do you know that stop?    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> No, I don't.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> He was a foot soldier on one of      the little Spanish expedition, :;;into the Caribbean that      shipwrecked in Florida. He was abandoned by- !I: captain in      Florida. He had a couple of other people with him      initially. I remember l that there was a black man with      him, Estevanico.    </p>    <p>      So they were as cast ashore as humans could be. And      starving and naked before too long, as you'd imagine. When      nearly dead, as he describes it in his account, they were      taken in by Indians and nursed to health. They were treated      well-as well as could beand then passed along. So they      started traveling westward and went from group to group,      being accepted everywhere they , went. They weren't speared      or hunted down, and the people they encountered as they      moved from group to group weren't fighting with each other.    </p>    <p>      Initially-for the first year or two-they were more or less      in shock, h,. then, at one point along the journey, a group      brought some sick people. Cabeza de Vaca, and he was asked      to heal them (he had learned a kin,: . sign language by      then, had gradually developed a means of communications.    </p>    <p>      And he said that he had never been a healer, that he had      never thought of himself as having any power to heal. But      the sick people were there, dill so he prayed. Being a      Catholic, he said, "Well, at least I can <em>pray."</em>      And the people got well! Of course, then more and more      patients were brought to him and he found that he      <em>was</em> a healer. He felt a real power of healing      rising v :in him. As a result of that power, he became      quite famous.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, at the end of his travels he wrote a letter to      the king, describing his adventures in North America, and      said, in effect, "On the paths-and trail, w the New \C      World hour Majesty ; people without weapons, naked andf      powerless, the natives of the New World, meet each other at      the crossroads of their world and plumb the depths of each      other simply by a look in the eyes." And he added, "A      greater gulf separates the New World from the Old World      than can ever be described."    </p>    <p>      He left us a good account of primitive (or      pre-white-contact) North America, which was a world in      which there were no policemen; it was a world in which you      might take your chances. But, on balance, a person with      courage and a straightforward look and a spirit of      generosity could walk across all the boundaries with no      difficulty.    </p>    <p>      That was true, of course, because part of the      <em>ethics</em> of the old ways was never to be stingy and      to always be hospitable. That was so even with the most      warlike Plains Indian tribes (who became warlike      <em>after</em> they got the horse). If you could get inside      the tepee and sit down as a guest, they wouldn't harm you.      You could go into an enemy village, wearing all of the gear      that <em>showed</em> that you were a member of the opposing      tribe, and-though you might be cut down going      <em>through</em> the villageif you got inside somebody's      tepee and sat down, they wouldn't touch you: You'd become a      guest. You'd be served food, and you'd be given safe      conduct outside the boundaries of the village. Then you'd      be on your own again. [Laughter]    </p>    <p>      So stinginess and lack of hospitality were generally      considered the greatest defects of character in the old      ways. And that's an example of the sort of widely held      belief that guarantees cosmopolitanism ...across a mosaic      of small cultures.    </p>    <p>      And, of course, in the case of the European Middle Ages,      what guaranteed cosmopolitanism-before they had any      national states-was the Roman Catholic Church.    </p>    <p>      Then too, for a period, Buddhism had that same function in      East Asia. The Buddhist monks could go across any boundary      from nation to nation and were, you know, always reminding      people that all men were brothers, just in case they      <em>needed</em> to be reminded.    </p>    <p>      Of course, in our postindustrial planetary future, if such      a pleasant dream does ever come about, the fact is that we      would be in much better condition to be in touch with each      other-in terms of communication and travel-than humankind      ever was in the past. This would make a sort of      cosmopolitanism really feasible.    </p>    <p>      So-with that history in mind-bioregionalists ask, "Why      <em>not</em> divide America up into eight or nine nations?"      Many people will respond, "Gee, who wants to be a small      nation?" And you have to remind people that the world is      full of small nations. They're perfectly viable. Most of      Europe-and most of the world-is composed of rather small      political entities.    </p>    <p>      It's the American bias to think that to be a small      political entity is somehow disadvantageous. It's also the      bias of many Americans to want to consolidate other      continents: to form a United States of Europe and maybe a      United States of Africa.    </p>    <p>      Now, some people feel that the establishment of a United      States of Africa would help reduce the warfare that goes on      between those countries. However, part of the      <em>reason</em> that Africa has such trouble is that the      national-state model was <em>imposed</em> on them, first by      colonialism and imperialism, and then by the way political      boundaries were drawn by World Wars I and II ...ignoring      ethnic or bioregional divisions. If those boundaries had      respected old divisions of culture, then they might at      least have avoided placing hostile ethnic factions within      the same nations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> We're never going to get away from      some amount of warfare. The question is more like how to      keep it on a workable scale, where we aren't actually      capable of blowing the world up ...for starters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Keep it down to a human scale?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Right. So bioregionalism should      not be thought of as overly idealistic or <em>overly</em>      utopian. There <em>are</em> problems. It is problematical      at many points ...but compared to what our experience in      history has already been, it wouldn't likely be any worse.      And it just might be better.    </p>    <p>      Then, to continue the search for a balance between      cosmopolitanism and local consciousness, the sophisticated      side of the bioregional proposal asks not only that natural      nations and ethnic entities be allowed to continue and that      we avoid strategies-economic and political strategies-that      would wear them down, but also that they be      <em>encouraged.</em> And then, on top of that      encouragement, we attempt to see the whole planet as      watershed-with its great body of planetary myth      lore-uniting the mosaic. Biology, ecology, and the old ways      could combine to lead us toward a workable planetary ethic.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> So an ecological consciousness      could form the overriding, almost religious, arch that      would tie the independent natural nations together?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> It could be a start, yes. Of      course, it would be not merely "ecological" but would      address the total community, including humans. It would      hold certain basic principles of respect and      self-determination for human beings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> On the other hand, the bioregional      perspective probably would not push too fast and hard for      just one style of human rights. And it would be perhaps      offensive to some idealistic people to say, "Let such and      such a group of people continue with such and such a      custom, if that's part of their culture. Let them discover      for themselves over the years how they want to deal with      that, rather than trying to impose instantly a democratic,      American constitutional, kind of bill of rights."    </p>    <p>      These are the real tricky questions. Here's where you get      down to the nittygritty of it. Consider the problem, for      example, of women's rights in some aboriginal tribes. The      choice would be the integrity of the culture from one      standpoint versus the idea of equal rights from      <em>another</em> standpoint.    </p>    <p>      That's the kind of area where the questions of unity and      diversity really sticky. But at least we're willing to      <em>think</em> about them. And I take comfort in the fact      that the bioregional perspective bases itself on an      anthropological and historical humanism 40,000 years old,      rather than on a strictly Occidental humanism 6,000 or      7,000 years old.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> It's also often been said that      there has almost never been a forced change of culture that      actually worked as it was planned to.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> I imagine that's true.    </p>    <p>      Now, the philosophical wing of the bioregional concept, in      a way, seems to be deep ecology, as a formulator of a      philosophical standpoint. Also, I like Ivan Illich's term,      "the recovery of the commons," as another description of      all the dimensions of what we're talking about. Asserting      bioregional communities is just one aspect of it. There's      also human nature, and there's the mischief of history.      Bioregionalism is just part of this whole question of how      the whole human race regains its natural self=determination      and realizes its place in nature after-at least in some      parts of the world-centuries of having been disenfranchised      by the structures of hierarchy and centralized power.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> To sort of bring it down to an      individual level, if people reading this interview are      inspired by this idea-are moved by the concept-what courses      of action could they take?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> They could certainly begin by      making contact with bioregional networkers in their area.      Such groups are gradually emerging around the country.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: See</em> <em>the list accompanying this      interview.] So</em> if people are interested, they can      write or visit the nearest bioregional networkers, and they      can also start by <em>themselves,</em> if they want. To do      so, you have to erase current county and state and national      boundaries from your mind, and then ask "What's      <em>really</em> here?" That means study ...and finding      teachers. The teachers are scientists, old farmers and      loggers, and your region's Indians. Scientifically, you'd      learn the ecology of your area, learn the plants. From old      settlers, you'd learn skills and lore. From the Indians,      deeper questions arise, such as "Who <em>are</em> coyote      and raven?" and "How do we learn proper etiquette?"    </p>    <p>      And people who follow this track tend to run into each      other. They slowly become a new society in an old nation,      evolving a shadow economy.    </p>    <p>      Have you <em>seen the</em> new issue of <em>Raise the      Stakes ...on</em> bioregional selfcriticism?    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> No.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> It's a good issue. It proposes      that we criticize the shortcomings and presumptions of this      movement, including its goofy polysyllabic terminology. And      there are some pretty good articles. Jim Dodge edited this      issue.    </p>    <p>      I put a critical thing in there, in which I said that      bioregionalism is not a panacea: In a sense, it's just a      part of the search for exterior proprieties. Setting proper      boundaries is not unlike spelling reforms, or the metric    </p>    <p>      system, or any kind of exterior propriety which in itself      doesn't necessarily change human character, doesn't      necessarily make human beings any better. I speak as a      Buddhist a lot of the time-well, actually, <em>all</em> of      the time-and it's part of the Buddhist insight that      imperfection and asymmetry are always going to be with us,      and that there's no ideal that we'll ever arrive at. The      closest thing to the ideal that we can hope for is to live      completely aware and mindfully and on balance in <em>this      moment.</em>    </p>    <p>      Ultimate things are not accomplished in history or in time,      and this moment-right here and now-is as good as any moment      is ever going to be anywhere. So we can't actually      <em>count on</em> some postindustrial, bioregional future      that will be better than right now.    </p>    <p>      Instead, we do the things we do as moral and aesthetic      exercises in our own time, to satisfy our own need for      thinking about the world clearly. But we have to realize      that we're not making the world any better. It's part of my      meditation, in a sense, to be able to say, "I live in the      actual range of Douglas fir." I don't do that to make the      future better; I do it to live in the present more clearly.    </p>    <p>      And if enough people in a given bioregion did that, the      area would <em>be</em> more like a natural nation. But      we're not going to do it in the courts or in Congress.    </p>		<p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> I guess living one's beliefs is      the best form of social action, really.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Well, to do so means <em>drawing      the line,</em> to use the title of one of Paul Goodman's      books. If you're going to try to live in the here and now      as if you were in a natural nation, there are certain      things that you won't do. And so you do draw a line. It      becomes a moral and ethical choice.    </p>    <p>      You manifest what you believe in your own life-not as an      isolated, pure, rebellious entity, either ...but together      with others. It should be a joint enterprise.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How do you see your role as a      poet in this?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> The poet has two roles. One is to      be very much alert to his own times and to be willing to      speak up and out on immediate issues, as well as to be so      totally in his literal own <em>kind</em> as to be as a poet      <em>outside</em> of his kind-to speak for raccoons and      birds and horses. Of course, as a poet you never look for      issues to write about: You only write about what comes to      you. So you might not write any political or ecologically      aware poems for decades. And that would be OK, too.    </p>    <p>      The creative person-the artist working as artist-is      responsible first and foremost to the voice that comes from      within. And if people, artists or not, will do their work      well and it doesn't happen to address the issues of this      decade, that's OK too. The real impact of poetry on      politics, though, is its impact on culture. And the impact      of a poetically manifested life of images and archetypes on      culture is a cumulative, slow process that takes centuries.      But, like glaciers, it cannot be stopped.    </p>    <p>      Poets and artists are involved in the politics of-as Jung      would say-the unconscious. But you can't see the fruit of      that work for many years, sometimes. It's been a century      and a half since William Blake wrote, and we just now begin      to see the force of William Blake's work.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> It's glacially slow, and      implacable. And the general trend of the direction that      this gradual shift of archetypal insights is following, I      think, is that we are seeing the emergence of a gradual      shift from a world framed by God the Father toward a vision      of the interacting, interdependent world under the      universe, the cosmos, the Mother. And a shift from a      hierarchical and competitive view of the structure to an      interacting, nonhierarchical, ecological vision of the way      the world is <em>structured ...</em> not foolishly      cooperative (wolves will still eat caribou), but      interacting in an ecological model, rather than in a      competitive model.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Would you say that you are      optimistic about the near or far future?    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Well, as I said before, I believe      that every day is its own day, but <em>I am</em> optimistic      about the far future, because Universe the Mother can      certainly take care of everything quite neatly. And nothing      human beings can do in the long run can amount to that      much. But I'm pessimistic about the future in the short      run, since it would be a great failing for this smart and      well-informed human race of the twentieth century to end up      being biologically superdestructive. It should be seen as      the real challenge of the world to be able to maintain all      of our marvelous scientific knowledge and technology to the      point of guaranteeing human rights on some wide scale      <em>and</em> guaranteeing that no species becomes extinct.      Extinction of species is a sign of great failure; it's a      great treachery to the history of organic evolution.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> It could almost serve as a modern      definition of sin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SNYDER:</strong> Well, at least of what constitutes      <em>error.</em> Practically speaking. however, we'll all      have our work cut out for us in just trying to keep the      best of whatever's going, going!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Gars's latest book, Axe Handles, ,an be      ordered-for $12.50 (hardcover) or $7.50 (paperback)      postpaid-from North Point Press, 850 Talbot Ave., Berkeley,      CA 94706.
