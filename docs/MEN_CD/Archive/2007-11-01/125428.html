        Sometimes all that's needed to relieve stress and create a freshstart is to clean out clutter and unwanted items. Whether it hidesin drawers, closets, the garage or even in plain sight, most of ushave stuff we no longer need, want or can use. These tips can helpyou open up space in your home, reduce waste and unnecessarypurchases, and maybe even help others find just what theyneed.<br /><br /><a href="http://earth911.org/" target="_blank">Recycling</a> glass,plastic, old magazines, catalogs and outdated paperwork is a greatfirst step. But for items that can't go to the recycling center,such as clothing and odd dishes, consider bartering, selling ordonating them.<br /><br />Swap parties are becoming increasingly popular, so invite yourfriends or a neighborhood group over for an afternoon of trading.Everyone can contribute their unneeded items to the pile, and thenthe fun 'shopping' begins!<br /><br />When your guests are gone, collect unclaimed pieces and make adelivery to your local donation center or<a href="http://www.goodwill.org" target="_blank">Goodwill</a>.They accept gently used clothing, fabric, kitchenware and hard toys(such as plastic or metal), among other things. Some local centersalso take furniture, but be sure to call ahead and check, as theymay be limited regarding the type and sizes they can reasonablyhandle. You can also take clothing to consignment or othersecondhand stores. Sell old books, donate them to a library, orsend them to soldiers via the<a href="http://www.booksforsoldiers.com/" target="_blank">Booksfor Soldiers</a> program.<br /><br />For usable items, you can post them for sale on<a href="http://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay</a> or<a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites.html" target="_blank">Craiglist</a>. You can also offer your treasuresfor give-away on <a href="http://www.freecycle.org/" target="_blank">Freecycle</a>. It's a great way to find new homesfor items that can't be recycled or donated, and maybe find itemsthat you do need, like that folding table for your daughter's dormroom.<br /><br />Some items, such as stuffed animals, require special cleaning andsanitization in order to be reused, which limits the places thatcan accept them. <a href="http://www.projectnightnight.org/" target="_blank">Project Night Night</a> collects stuffed animalsfor children without homes, and <a href="http://animalbeacons.org/" target="_blank">Animals Beacons of Light</a> distributes them toshelters, orphanages and other areas where they're needed. Membersof the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stationed in Iraq are acceptingstuffed animal donations (as well as school supplies and gentlyused clothing) for Iraqi children. For more information, click<a href="http://www.parenthacks.com/2006/10/update_from_edm.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />Certain products have their own reuse/recycle programs, such as the<a href="http://www.nike.com/nikebiz/nikebiz.jhtml?page=27&cat=reuseashoe" target="_blank">Reuse-a-Shoe</a> program for worn out tennies.   Whether it's a mateless cross-trainer or your collection of high   school running sneakers, send them in to be converted to tracks,   playgrounds and athletic courts.<br /><br />There are also special homes for defunct<a href="http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/recycle/ecycling/donate.htm" target="_blank">electronic and technical equipment</a>. Most   major computer companies now offer recycling programs (for a   fee) for their computers.   <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/dell_recycling?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs" target="_blank">Dell</a> will recycle any of their old computers   for free (you just pay shipping) ? and if you're purchasing a   new Dell or   <a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/recycling/" target="_blank">Apple</a> computer, both offer free recycling   (shipping not included) for your old computer, regardless of its   brand.<br /><br />There are many places to sell working electronic equipment, and ifyou can't exchange them for cash, consider donating them.<a href="http://www.greendisk.com/" target="_blank">Greendisk</a>will take your CDs, VCR, cords, cables, MP3 players, video gamecartridges, VHS and cassette tapes, digital cameras and othertechnical items.
