        Autumn and winter are the perfect seasons for drawing birds to youryard by providing an appetizing ? and necessary ? food supply. Thistime of year, birds are hunting for reliable food sources toprepare for dropping temperatures and dwindling natural foodsupplies. Establishing a popular food stop benefits both parties ?you'll enjoy entertaining guests and have the satisfaction ofseeing them comfortably through the winter months.<br /><br />Your feathered guests need to eat from one third to three fourthstheir body weight every day to have the energy to look for food andkeep warm in the cold weather. High-energy or 'heating' foods willnot only draw a larger crowd, but provide them with the extra fatand nourishment they need to replenish their stores. The bird foodrecipes below (all from <i>Bird Food Recipes</i>, by RhondaMassingham Hart; Storey Communications, 1995) appeal to a varietyof birds and are great for fall and winter feeding.<br /><br /><b>Fat & Sassy</b><br />2 parts suet, lard,bacon drippings or saved kitchen fat<br />1 to 2 parts yellow cornmeal<br />Dash of salt and sand<br />1 part fine cracked corn, mullet or hulled sunflower<br /><br />Melt suet over low heat. Allow to cool and harden, then heat again.Stir in peanut butter and other ingredients, reserving some of thecorn or seeds. Allow to cool somewhat and pour into molds or forminto balls. Roll balls into loose corn or seed.<br /><br /><b>Hanging Heaven</b><br />3 parts suet<br />1 part cornmeal<br />1 part peanut butter<br />1 part brown sugar<br />1 part raisins, dried cherries, etc.<br />1 part mixed seed or broken nuts<br />Sprinkling of sand<br />1 or more coconuts, split in half<br /><br />Melt suet, allow to cool, then re-melt. Stir in other ingredients.Cook until the mixture is the consistency of porridge. If toothick, add small amounts of water or milk; if too thin, add flour.Pour into coconut halves. Hang coconut halves from tree limbs oreaves.<br /><br /><b>Scrap Pie</b><br />This recipe is a great way to use up wholesome leftovers.<br /><br />4 cups crumbs (bread, cookie, cake, doughnut, etc.)<br />4 cups kitchen scraps (noodles, meat scraps, fruit or vegetables,etc.), chopped<br />4 eggs<br />1/4 cup honey<br />1/2 tsp salt<br />1 tsp fine sand<br />2 cups milk<br />2 tbsp shortening or melted bacon fat<br /><br />Grease baking pan and layer bread crumbs and scraps. Beat eggs andmix with remaining ingredients. Pour over crumbs and scraps. Coverand chill for 1 to 3 hours, then bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour.Cool and crumble to serve.<br /><br />Finally, many birds scavenge roadways to find salt, minerals andsand for nutrients and the grit needed to digest their food. Offerthis recipe as a safer alternative.<br /><br /><b>Crystalline</b><br />Salt<br />Wood ashes*<br /><br />Mix salt and ashes with enough water to dissolve and pour over alarge rock, stump or wood block. As the water evaporates, crystalsform that attract mineral-hungry birds. (Be sure to keep the saltwater away from areas that are planted with shrubs or near gardens? salinating the soil can create problems for plant growth.) *Thesecan be fireplace ashes as long as they do not contain residues fromcolored (especially red) or slick paper.<br /><br /><br />Good food is just the beginning of a successful backyard birdsanctuary.
