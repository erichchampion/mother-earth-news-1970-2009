        <p>Perhaps all the firewood you'll need for this winter is splitand neatly stacked. But you may need to cut up a fallen tree orsplit kindling. Is your chain saw ready? Is you axe sharp? Here aresome tips to keep your wood-cutting equipment in goodcondition.</p><br /><p><strong>AXE MAINTENANCE</strong></p><br /><p><strong>Sharpening an Axe.</strong> Most axes are more than justa blade; they also function as a wedge. The sharp edge of the axehead creates an entry into wood, but the wider part of a convexblade actually pushes the wood apart to split or chip it.Sharpening an axe involves much more than achieving a sharp edge,here are some tips.</p><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Wear gloves and don't sharpen an axe on your lap (if it slipsand cuts your leg, it will be near a major artery).</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Maintain the same basic shape of the axe head as when it wasnew.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>To shape the head, start with a coarser rasp or file, makingstrokes diagonal (not perpendicular) to the edge, then diagonal inthe other direction.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Sharpen the edge with a stone (oil or water keeps the dust fromclogging the pores in the stone).</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Don't try to get out all the nicks in the edge. It's notnecessary; to do so and maintain the correct shape of the headwould quickly wear it down.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p>A step-by-step guide to sharpening axes is available at<a href="http://www.bushcraftuk.com/articles/skills--general/how-to-sharpen-an-axe.html" target="_blank">BushcraftUK</a>. It includes photos and illustrations.</p><br /><p><strong>Replacing an Axe Handle.</strong> Eventually, most axehandles will splinter or the axe head will become loose (and youdon't want it to fly off the handle).</p><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>To remove the old handle, drill some holes into the end of thehandle that you can see through the 'eye' of the axe head, thenpound the old handle out of the eye using a steel bar andhammer.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>If the new handle doesn't fit perfectly, use a rasp to shapethe end of the handle that fits into the eye.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Be sure the head is aligned perfectly with the handle ? notslightly twisted ? so that the head meets the wood squarely whenyou're chopping.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Tighten the handle by driving a wooden wedge into the split inthe handle. Most new handles have a groove for this wedge alreadycut into the end that fits into the axe head, but if yours doesnot, saw a groove into the neck of the handle.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Saw off the excess part of the new handle, including the excesswedge. For additional security, tap a metal wedge into the handlealmost perpendicular to the wooden wedge.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p><strong>CHAIN SAW MAINTENANCE</strong></p><br /><p>Chain saws make quick work of jobs that might take much longerwith an axe. Proper maintenance will increase the life of yourchain saw and make it more effective while you're using it.Maintenance for chain saws varies somewhat by model, but here aresome reminders that pertain to all (consult your owner's manual forspecific maintenance of your saw).</p><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Keep the chain lubricated.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Maintain proper chain tension.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Clean out the housing over the base of the bar.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Clean out the groove in the bar.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Maintain the engine (air filter, clean oil, spark plug).</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p><strong>Sharpening the Chain.</strong> A sharp saw chainproduces shavings as it cuts, but a dull chain produces finershavings that look more like saw dust. Sharpening a saw chaininvolves not only sharpening the cutting teeth, but also the depthgauges.</p><br /><p>Sharpen the cutting teeth with a round file and a guide. All ofthe teeth should be sharpened at the same angle to do the best job.Fastidious sharpeners will count the number of strokes of the fileused on each tooth to keep all the teeth even. About every fourthtime you sharpen the cutting teeth, file down the depth gauges aswell.
