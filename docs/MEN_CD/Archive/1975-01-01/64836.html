    <p>
                        <p>      Up in Maine last summer I started a welding route and made      a pocketful of money. The trade was easy, quickly learned      and much in demand . . . every other home seemed to have a      couple of articles for me to put back into service. Now,      while I spend the winter at my teaching job in New York      State, I'm waiting eagerly for next summer and another      season of my new sideline.    </p>    <p>      I acquired this skill in the first place because I couldn't      get an old wheel hoe welded . . . and decided to stop      looking for service and do the repair myself. For $39.95 I      bought a UL-approved Solidox welding set sold by Montgomery      Ward for use on small home articles. After some practice      with scraps, I brazed the hoe frame with no trouble at all.    </p>    <p>      My introduction, to the money end of welding came later,      when I bought a can of flux at a coastal hardware store.      "Don't know who you are," spoke up Mr. Lewis, the owner,      "but if you're interested, I have some small boat chains      and other things out back that need welding." I accepted      the offer and in three days had the items back in good      repair (except for a pulley and a bracket to a washing      machine motor, both too much for the Solidox to handle).    </p>    <p>      Since it turned out that Mr. Lewis was already accepting      lawn mowers and saws to be held for a mechanic who came by      once a week, I asked him to collect damaged metal items for      me in the same way. "People around here need something like      this," he agreed, and his store became my first "drop".    </p>    <p>      I knew, of course, that my little home welder wouldn't be      adequate for commercial work. Since the money possibilities      of this trade looked so good, I decided to go all the way      with equipment and training.    </p>    <p>      Accordingly, I began spending afternoons (at $10.00 a      session) with a Mr. Warner who owned a shop near Bangor. He      started me off checking flames, testing metals and      controlling torch pressures . . . and I soon found out why      welding may not be for everyone. It's necessary to study      and practice for many hours to get the right flames, to      avoid burning thin metals and warping thick pieces. And not      only the quality of the work but its neat appearance is      important in getting return jobs.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by HENRY L. FARR    </h5>    <p>      Still, I made progress . . . and I didn't lack for practice      material, since folks started dropping off broken items      when word got around that I was doing repairs. On each trip      to Bangor I took along a couple of articles to mend under      the expert eye of Mr. Warner or his son. Meanwhile, my      instructor got together for me a set of brass valves,      regulators, whips (hoses), blow pipes and other gear for      less than $100.    </p>    <p>      I got further valuable help from a visiting Navyman who      came by to have a slashed fender brazed. When he noticed my      slow work, he smiled and offered advice. "That's my line of      business," he told me. "If you just hold the torch more to      the side and then run the flame along the upper surface it      will heat more evenly." The same man dropped by several      more evenings to chat and lend a hand with some of the      harder jobs.    </p>    <p>      I also found books a big help in learning my new trade. The      first text I bought was R.H. Cooley's <em>Complete      Metalworking Manua</em> l ($10.00 from Arco Publishing Co.      or from MOTHER'S Bookshelf). Chapters 14 and 15, which      telescope the welding process into 21 pages, are very      useful. Later, I ordered a copy of <em>Introductory Welding      Metallurgy,</em> $5.00 from the American Welding Society,      2501 N.E. Seventh Avenue, Miami, Florida 33125.    </p>    <p>      Looking back, I believe that sound planning was as      important to my success as learning the welding process . .      . and here, too, reading can be helpful. One good guide is      the pamphlet <em>Starting and Managing a Home Business</em>      by Ralph Metcalf, available for 750 from the Superintendent      of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.      20402.    </p>    <p>      Since I intended to pick up work on a regular basis from a      number of prearranged collection points, my first step in      organizing the business was to map out a route that would      save travel. My wife and I drove around my prospective      territory to get a good idea of the kind of areas I'd be      working in, and found that the settlements were made up of      farms and summer cottages.    </p>    <p>      I then visited each community on my list-nine towns      and villages, all within 20 miles of my home-and checked to      verify that no other welding service was available. If the      coast was clear, I went after sponsors. This was really a      matter of making friendly contacts . . . so, whenever I      entered a settlement, I figured out several ways to break      the ice. In a diner, for instance, I ordered a very unusual      sandwich. That brought on a discussion which I turned to      the local schools and crops, and then to the subject of      finding a collection point. Another time I noticed in a      drugstore a poster advertising a coming drag race. After a      few words about local drivers I moved on to my own topic of      possible drops.    </p>        <p>      Incidentally, I found that collection points were easier to      get when I began tossing around a few welding terms such as      "flux", "spelter" and "brazing". An air of familiarity with      many angles of the field helps to give folks confidence.    </p>    <p>      Two days of scouting brought me all the contacts I needed.      I ran into a couple of setbacks, of course: One resort town      had to be scratched because of a bicycle shop that did      welding, and two agents that I thought were signed up      called later and backed off. Also, not all the people I      approached were equally friendly. ("I know you're an      out-of-stater by your voice," a farm implement dealer      shouted at me. "Get moving along!")    </p>    <p>      Other local businessmen, though, met me more than halfway.      The operator of a just-opened filling station signed on      before I could explain all the conditions. "Ought to bring      in some gas business too," he said. And a boatyard owner      loaded a damaged outboard into my station wagon before we      talked of terms at all. "Never mind the cost," he mumbled.      "And yes, I'll collect for you. But get this done so I can      pick it up myself by Wednesday."    </p>    <p>      My "partners" were all satisfied with a 20 percent      commission-one grocer even offered to forgo his      share-and I made my first pickups the Saturday after      Mr. Warner, my welding instructor, turned me loose.      Thereafter I covered the route weekly, mostly to iron out      problems . . . but next year once every two weeks will be      the plan.    </p>    <p>      Things went well and I lost only two drops during the      summer, while gaining four more. One of my new agents, a      retired mailman, was starting a swap shop and I did a lot      of welding for him.    </p>    <p>      I let people know about my service by means of newspaper      ads, and by having a boy or girl in each town distribute      handbills on goldenrod stock. Then my wife made up a bundle      of posters-red letters on gray-for store      windows and drops. (Later I also found a place to get a      batch of claim checks, which I divided among my      collectors.)    </p>    <p>      "I think about $3.00 would be a good minimum," Me. Warner      had suggested when I talked about pricing my work. "And you      could telephone owners the evening after pickups to give      estimates on larger jobs." This was the system I worked on      all summer, with only two misunderstandings.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, a beginner like me had to make a few mistakes.      One of them was promising work much too fast. When I      started my home business the neighbors brought in a lot of      jobs that had been building up . . . but I learned to      schedule sensible finish dates without losing customers.    </p>    <p>      Another half dozen or so errors arose from misreading of      instructions. Once I cut an old water tank in two pieces      crosswise, and then discovered that the lady who owned it      wanted it split lengthwise, for flowerbeds. Another time .      . . "I told you I wanted a <em>stand</em> welded onto this      spotlight," a retired game warden thundered. I had      mistakenly attached a handle.    </p>    <p>      A number of unusual situations came up along With the      ordinary jobs, and I found that I could keep the friends      I'd made by being flexible and fitting into the situation.    </p>    <p>      For example: "I hear you do welding," came over the      telephone one wet August evening, "I want you to go to the      Eternal Rest Cemetery to repair an ornamental iron rose."      Directions followed. The Solidox proved perfect for work on      the delicate tracery of metal, and the woman cheerfully      handed me $10.00 for two short hours of work.    </p>    <p>      Then, too, there's always the possibility of barter      transactions. I once found myself welding bronze letters      back into place over the entrance to a Little League park.      My pay? Four tickets.    </p>    <p>      I also broadened the scope of my service slightly to meet      the needs of my customers. "I know this isn't a welding      job," a man explained, stopping me on the road, "but I need      this axe sharpened to chop down a leaning cedar." I found      that other people were leaving dull articles along with the      damaged items to be welded . . . so I ordered an airmailed      copy of <em>Scissors</em> <em>Sam Says Be Sharp</em> ($1.50      from MOTHER'S Bookshelf) and Harry Walton's <em>Home</em>      <em>and Workshop Guide to Sharpening</em> ($3.00 from      Harper & Row, 10 E. 53rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10022)      and changed my newspaper ad to include sharpening and      grinding.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, of course, practice was increasing my skill as a      welder. After my second pickup I spent another session with      Mr. Warner's son to master some points I had noticed about      several of the jobs I'd collected. Next year I'll be expert      enough to go out on the "road to weld tractor rods, cracked      furnaces and farm equipment.    </p>    <p>      It was a profitable summer: Before the last pickup my wife      went over the books and figured I was making over $3.00 per      hour. And the $200 or so we laid out for equipment and for      my training will all be to the good next season.    </p>    <p>      My own experience convinces me that welding is a first-rate      home business opportunity . . . especially now, when      inflation is causing so many of us to think "fix it"      instead of "toss it". ("For years I've intended to have      this step stool repaired," a summer visitor said when I      stopped by. "Now, please do mend it for me.") And-in      view of the trouble I had trying to get my wheel hoe put in      order-I believe a newcomer might find very little      competition in his own area, even with the top pay welders      are getting. Think it over: Could welding bring in that      extra money you've been looking for?    </p>    <p>      <em>Henry Farr first sent this article to MOTHER about a      year ago. Now, with another season of welding behind him,      he has a few additional thoughts on his vacation      business.</em>    </p>    <p>      I had a good summer . . . a lot easier than the first one,      since the business was already established. Two of my      pickup points had to be dropped (one collector was tired of      being involved, the other had brought in too little work to      keep me going), but I added a new 16-mile subroute that      paid well. In the end I didn't bother to go into the field      for jobs, since I had enough to do as it was.    </p>    <p>      The price of materials has risen about 7 to 9 percent in      the past year. A tank of oxygen, for instance, runs around      $9.00 at present. The cost of copper rods went up      temporarily but is now down to $2.00 per pound. I haven't      raised my own charges . . . and I was right about one      effect of inflation: People are more save-it conscious than      ever.    </p>    <p>      Finally, a plug for the little Solidox I continue to find      it just dandy for short jobs. It really produces a terrific      heat.    </p>
