                    <h5 id="byline">     by LYNNE WOOD:    </h5>        <p>      Way 'back in MOTHER NO. 22 (page 118) Sue Montgomery asked      how she could recycle the debris of small scraps      (especially those not suited for patchwork) that were      always left over from her sewing projects. Well, here I am      . . . finally getting around to writing down my solution to      that problem. Just as Sue does, of course, I use up my      "good" remnants doing patchwork and making stuffed animals      and dolls. But the tiniest bits of surplus cloth I set      aside in a special box labeled "For My Little Friends".    </p>    <p>      During my leisure hours I turn these variegated odds and      ends into "cloth balls", completely safe baby toys that are      tremendously popular with all the baby-through-toddler set.      The fact that hardly two scraps in my box are alike is a      great plus when I'm using them for cloth balls. The more      variety in the textures and colors used in sewing these      globes, the more they will catch a child's eye and provide      him or her with an interesting plaything. Bright, stiff      materials such as sailcloth, fake furs and suedes are      ideal.    </p>    <p>      To make a cloth ball you'll need (in addition to your most      colorful, merry remnants) a cardboard pattern for an      equilateral pentagon (Fig. 1). The bigger you cut this      pattern, the bigger the finished toy will be. I make mine      about three inches across between the widest points. Use      your pattern to cut 12 pentagons from surplus scraps,      adding a 3/8-inch seam allowance on all sides as you      scissor around the guide. Once you have the sections cut      out, baste down the seam allowance around all five edges of      each patch and then iron over the stitching so the material      lies flat (Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      You're now ready to begin constructing the cloth ball by      sewing the first three pentagons together to form the top      of the toy (Fig. 3). This is done very easily by placing      two pentagons together and whipstitching along the common      seam line, then snugly fitting the third piece against the      first two. When joined like this the three pieces will form      a kind of dome. Into the triangular edges under the dome,      fit the pointy end of three more pentagons (Fig. 4). This      completes the top half of the toy. Now repeat the same      process to create the bottom of the toy. Finishing the      cloth ball is just a simple matter of fitting the two      halves together, matching up their jogs (Fig. 5). As you do      this, remember to leave a small open space along one seam      line so that you can stuff the ball with batting      or-to be even more frugal-with old, cut-up      nylon stockings. Then blindstitch the opening closed.    </p>    <p>      If you want this homemade toy to make a noise (and what      child isn't delighted by anything that does?) you can put a      big jingle bell smack in the middle of it before the final      stitching. The bell won't ring, but it will rattle.    </p>    <p>      I hope this idea will help Sue make good use of her sewing      leftovers . . . and encourage every seamstress to make a      toy for a little friend. Several of my favorite youngsters      wouldn't be parted from their rotund fabric noisemaker for      anything!    </p>
