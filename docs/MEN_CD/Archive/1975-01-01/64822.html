                       <h5 id="byline">   by WILLIAM P. EARWOOD    </h5>       <p>      I really felt sorry for Jim DeKorne (MOTHER NO. 28) when he      described how he filled all those concrete blocks with more      concrete. I've had to do the same thing . . . never could      lay a course straight. There <em>is</em> another      alternative, though. What with paying 50 cents each for      blocks, and then having to buy the cement to tamp into      them, I figure it would be a little cheaper to cast one's      own concrete building units in place.    </p>    <p>      Some forms I've designed for that purpose might, I think,      be helpful to do-it-yourself builders. The accompanying      diagrams show how they work. Fig. 1 is the layout of the 8"      X 16" block, with the spacing of the holes noted. As you      can see from Fig. 2-a plan of the form-the      equivalent of three blocks is laid down in one pour. The      holes are created around pieces of plastic drainpipe as      each course goes up (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the construction      of corners, Fig. 5 is a detail of a doorway or crawl space      and Fig. 6 indicates how to make a slot for a casement      window or whatever.    </p>    <p>      Most block construction calls for an 8" X 16" footer. I'd      suggest building forms for the wall's base from 2" X 8"      boards, and then using the same lumber for the block forms      after the footer is done. Several molds will make the      concrete work go a lot faster.    </p>    <p>      The height of the block can be controlled by the form's end      plates (see Fig. 2). If you goof on your measurements, just      make the necessary correction by raising or lowering those      pieces. Also, leveling can be adjusted by means of small      wedges under the same panels.    </p>    <p>      A note on making the holes: Set the pipes in place, pour      the concrete, wait about an hour and rotate the lengths of      plastic a few times so they won't freeze in position.    </p>    <p>      My method can, of course, be used to cast block of      different sizes. For instance, if you want to build a      hotbed or compost bin with four-inch-thick walls, pour a 4"      X 10" footer and use one-inch plastic pipe to form the      holes.    </p>    <p>      Casting your own concrete units in position has several      advantages. For one thing, if you're a weekend builder of a      place in the country, you won't have to worry about someone      ripping off your blocks in your absence. Or, if you're      building and gardening too, you can just fill as many forms      as you have time for and then go back to the bean patch.      You'll be surprised how much concrete work you can get done      using small forms . . . and it's interesting to see what      other do-it-yourself ideas you can figure out.    </p>
