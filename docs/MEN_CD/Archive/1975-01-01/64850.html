            		    <h5 id="byline">by ELIZABETH A. MARTIN</h5>                                <p>      Ever admire the beauty of a traditional homemade quilt . .      . and then shudder at the thought of all the stitches that      hold the masterpiece together? Well, there's a simpler      alternative: tying. You can tie a frayed blanket between      layers of cotton or gingham print in a fraction of the time      you'd spend on conventional quilting. All you need is a      simple frame (see the instructions with this article), a      few inexpensive materials and the barest number of spare      hours.    </p>    <h3>      QUILT SIZES    </h3>    <p>      Baby quilts are approximately 3' X 5' (standard crib size)      and, when tied, can be made in an afternoon. Two-yard      throws-afghan-size car blankets, or stadium      robes-are 4' X 6' and also take only a few hours.      They get their name because the quilt top and backing 'each      requires two yards of 45" fabric.    </p>    <p>      A quilt that measures 7' X 9' hangs to the floor on a twin      bed and Vill fit a full-size bed as a comforter (a cover      that usually lies on the. mattress only and is supplemented      with a dust ruffle to conceal the box springs). A quilt (8'      X 9') that completely covers a full-size bed will serve as      a comforter on a king-size or large water bed.    </p>    <h3>      MATERIALS    </h3>    <p>      The backing or underside of a tied quilt should be a      closely woven, non-slippery fabric. (Covers backed with      nylon, satin, rayon and some polyesters tend to slide off      the bed.) Cottons, flannels and sheets are all good      materials for this purpose. I prefer flannel myself: It's      durable and warm, won't slip and feels good against the      skin. Like all the makings for my quilts, it's also      washable.    </p>    <p>      Filler or batting may consist of an old blanket (two if      they're thin). Otherwise use cotton or polyester quilt      batting, which is available at most yard goods stores or      from Sears.    </p>    <p>      The quilt top can be scraps put together as gay patchwork,      or you can use cotton prints, flannel, gingham or a      colorful sheet Be sure to preshrink both the top and      backing before "putting up" the quilt.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO STRETCH THE QUILT ON THE FRAME    </h3>    <p>      At this point-before you go any farther-make      sure that :he quilt's top and backing are the same size.      Use a straight pin to mark the center of each edge.    </p>    <p>      The backing goes on your frame first, with the center      points of its edges matched to the center points marked on-      the -boards and pinned to the frame's cloth covering. Then,      working from the center to the ends of each side, continue      to pin the fabric to the stretcher.    </p>    <p>      Next, spread the blanket filler or batting evenly over the      taut cloth. Be sure there are no lumps.    </p>    <p>      The top is then laid over the filler and pinned to the      frame just as the backing was. Adjust the C-clamps that      hold your frame together at the corners so that the quilt      is taut but not strained . . . and you're ready to tie.    </p>    <h3>      TYING    </h3>    <p>      Ties should be evenly spaced and no more than two inches      apart. They can be arranged in rows or staggered:    </p>        <p>      If the quilt top has a geometric or regular pattern, let      the Print on the fabric space your ties for you. For      example, with one-inch checked gingham you'd want a knot in      the middle-or at the corner-of every other      square. Use a grid to space the ties on a scattered      pattern. This guide can be made of a 9" X 12" Piece of      cardboard with holes punched in it at the proper intervals.      Lay the grid on the material and mark the place for each      fastening with a pencil, as shown in one of the photos that      accompany this article.    </p>    <p>      Either yarn or crochet cotton can be used for the tying.      Choose the shortest needle you can find that has a big      enough eye and thread it with a three-foot length of yarn      or string. This should be pulled through the eye until the      ends are even, to create a double strand, but should not be      knotted. If possible, wear a thimble while working.    </p>    <p>      Tying is always done from the top of the quilt, with one      hand underneath to make sure the needle goes through all      thicknesses. This is very important. If the thread or yarn      doesn't go through all the way so that it shows on the      back, you must take it out and put it in again. When in      doubt, crawl under the quilt and look! (Sometimes, if the      fabric is heavy or has a firm finish, the needle sticks      fast in the cloth sandwich and has to be pulled through      with pliers.)    </p>    <p>      As you work from the top, take as small a stitch as      possible down and back up through all layers of cloth at      the first marker in one of the end rows. Leave a two-inch      tail of thread, take a second stitch over the first, tie a      square knot and pull it tight. <em>Don't cut the      thread!</em> just go on to the next mark and repeat the      process until all the yarn on the needle is used.    </p>    <p>      At that point go back and snip the thread in two halfway      between each pair of ties. Leave the tails on, and try to      keep them all the same length. If you spaced the fastenings      evenly and made the breaks midway between, you shouldn't      have to do any trimming. And, believe me, it's much faster      to snip the connections between a whole line of knots than      to do so after you finish each one.    </p>    <p>      When you've tied as far toward the center of the quilt as      you can reach from one end, repeat the process from the      other. Then release two C-clamps to free one short side of      the frame and "roll up" the tied material around that      board-removing pins as necessary along the sides-until you      come to fresh territory. Replace the clamps so that the      fabric is pulled snugly taut and continue in this fashion      until the tying is done. (Don't try to roll all four sides      of the stretcher . . . work only from the two opposing ends      toward the middle.) When the quilt is done, remove it from      the frame.    </p>    <h3>      EDGING THE QUILT    </h3>    <p>      To finish your quilt in the simplest way, just turn the raw      edges of the top (down and in) and the backing (up and in)      to the inside and blind stitch by hand or top stitch by      machine.    </p>    <p>      If you prefer an ornamental border, pin the lace, rickrack      or whatever to the top-right sides      together-about 1/4 inch from the fabric's raw edge.      Machine stitch the trim to the quilt top. Then turn under      1/4 inch of the backing's raw edge and pin it-all      around the cover's four sides-to the turned, trimmed      edge of the top. Blind stitch by hand or carefully top      stitch by machine through all thicknesses.    </p>    <p>      If you've used washable materials and preshrunk them be      fore tying, the finished quilt can be machine washed and      tumble dried . . . a good point to remember during its      making, since you can expect your hand-tied cover to keep      you warm through a good many cold winters in the future.      That's quite a return for a few hours of pleasant handwork!    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO MAKE A QUILTING FRAME    </h3>    <p>      To ensure that a finished quilt will lie smoothly, without      pulls and puckers, its layers of material should be      stitched together while stretched on a frame. This      structure may be very simple or somewhat more elaborate . .      . depending on how much quilting you expect to do.    </p>        <h3>      I. SIMPLE FRAME    </h3>    <p>      The simplest frame consists of:    </p>    <p>      [1] Four boards (suggested size 1 " X 4") approximately      8-1/2' long.<br />      [2] Four C-clamps.<br />      [3] Four chairs of equal height.    </p>    <p>      Scrap lumber works fine. Width and thickness aren't      critical, but do sand the wood smooth so you won't get      splinters while quilting.    </p>    <p>      Lay two of the boards on the floor parallel to each other,      cross them with the other two to form a rectangle and      fasten the frame together with C-clamps. Set a chair at      each corner of the structure and lift the frame to rest on      the tops of the backs. Securely tie each comer to its      support with rope or strips of cloth.    </p>    <p>      The fabric for the quilt is fastened to the frame with      thumbtacks.    </p>    <h3>      II. QUILTING FRAME WITH FREE-STANDING LEGS    </h3>    <p>      If you do a lot of quilting, you'll want a sturdier frame      that's easier to use. I've found the following design most      satisfactory for both stitching and tying.    </p>    <p>      You will need:    </p>    <p>      [1] Two boards (1" X 4", preferably hardwood) 8'      long.<br />      [2] Two boards (1" X 4", preferably hardwood) 10'      long.<br />      [3] Four C-clamps.<br />      [4] One 4' X 8' sheet of 3/4" plywood.<br />      [5] Four strips of cloth (an old sheet works fine) 5" wide,      two pieces 8' long and two pieces 10' in length.<br />      [6] Some short flathead nails.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STEP 1:</strong> MAKE THE LEGS OF THE FRAME: Cut      the plywood according to the pattern shown to give you four      each of the two types of leg sections. You can see the two      basic units-plus a frame board and a C-clamp-in      the accompanying photo.    </p>    <p>      Each leg is formed by fitting the taller plywood piece at      right angles down over the shorter. A frame board will then      rest in the "U" at the top of the upright.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STEP 2:</strong> ATTACH CLOTH STRIPS TO THE FRAMING      BOARDS: Cut an old sheet into strips as directed in [5]      above, and fold the raw cloth in 1/2" on each lengthwise      edge. Then fold each strip in half and machine stitch the      turned-under edges together. Finally-using short,      flathead nails-attach one strip of the doubled fabric to      each of the framing boards. Position the cloth so that its      single-fold edge is even with an edge of the board and      fasten it down by nailing through the stitched edge (which      will be near the center of the board as shown in the      photo).    </p>    <p>      <strong>STEP 3:</strong> MAKE A MARK in permanent ink at      the center of each of the frame's boards (to be used later      as a guide for the attachment of the quilting material).    </p>    <p>      <strong>STEP 4:</strong> ASSEMBLE THE FRAME: Fit the leg      pieces together and place the supports at the corners of a      rectangle measuring about 7' X 9'. Rest the two 10' boards      on the legs so the sides are parallel. Then lay the two      shorter pieces across the longer ones to form right angles      and fasten the rectangle together at the corners with      C-clamps.    </p>
