                        <h3>OMELETTE AU SPROUT MILITARISTICA</h3>    <p>      Heat some healty-type oil in a frying pan or on a griddle      while you beat two eggs till your wrist is sore. Chop a      small fistful of sprouts and grate or slice 1/8 to 1/4 cup      of cheese and sprouts and fold the egg up over the mountain      of nutrition. Flip the omelette and let it cook till you      thnk it's done Voila! A low-cost, high-protein, crunchy      breakfast treat.    </p>    <p>      This recipe is taken from Ed Zahniser's articles, "Good      Things From the Garden in the Closet", pages 50-53, THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) Issue No. 12    </p>          <h3>QUICK-FIX TASTY TREATS</h3>     <p>      Grind together 1 cup sprouted wheat, 1 cup almonds or other      soft nuts and 1 cup seeded raisins. Salt to taste and mix      well. Roll into little balls and keep on rolling right      through some grated coconut. Chew 50 times like you should      chew all your food. Unlike store-bought goodies (which      decompose with 10 chomps) these sprout yummies just get      better and better. A definite taste trip.    </p>    <p>      This recipe is taken from Ed Zahniser's article, "Good      Things From The Garden in the Closet", pages 50-53, THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) Issue No. 12.    </p>      <h3>CRUNCHY CABBAGE</h3>    <p>      Even hard-core vegetable haters often yield to dishes      prepared in the Chinese manner... which is basically a      question of cutting the making into small pieces and      cooking them quickly in a little oil to preserve their      natural crispness. Take cabbage, for example (shredded,      that is... about 4 cupfuls) Combine it with 2 cup of mung      bean sprouts and saute the vegetables in 3 tablespoons of      oil for about 5 minutes (until the cabbage is cooked but      still crunchy). Add 1 tablespoon of caraway seeds plus salt      and pepper, toss the mixture lightly and enjoy. Serves 6.    </p>    <p>      From The Complete Spouting Cookbook by Karen Cross Whyte,      Troubador Press, copyright © 1973 by author.    </p>         <h3>SPROUTS AU GRATIN</h3>        <p>      Steam 3 cups of soybean sprouts for 10 minutes. Heat 2      tablespoons of oil over a medium fire, blend in 2      tablespoons flour and slowly add 1 cup of milk. Keep      stirring! When the sauce boils and thickens mix in 1/2 cup      cottage cheese over the top and cover the whole with 1/4      cup of bread crumbs dotted with butter. Bake this      nourishing creation in a 375° oven for 30 minutes or      until it's nicely brown, and feed it to 4-6 people.    </p>    <p>      From The Complete Sprouting Cookbook by Karen Cross Whyte,      Troubador Press, copyright © 1973 by author.    </p>      <h3>SOY SPROUT MILK</h3>        <p>      Soy sprout <em>what</em> ? Believe it or not, this highly      nutritious liquid is very tasty as beverage. It can also be      used as a substitute for the cow's milk called for in many      recipes. It's an excellent alternative for strict      vegetarians and allergy sufferers.    </p>    <p>      Just pour 1 cup sprouted soybeans, 4 cups of warm water and      2 tablespoons honey into the blender and whiz them all      together fr 5 minutes. Then cook the mixture for about 10      minutes over medium heat, while you stir it constantly.      Strain off the milk for drinking or cooking... and don't      forget to use the pulp as a filler in meat or vegetable      dishes!    </p>    <p>      From The Beansprout Book by Gary Courter, Simon and      Schuster, copyright © 1973 by author.    </p>         <h3>NAVY BEAN SOUP</h3>       <p>      This cold-weather favorite is faster cooking and far more      nutritious made with sprouted instead of plain dried beans.      For 5 servings, you'll need 4 cups of navy bean sprouts and      2 cups vegetable or meat broth. Simmer these      ingredients-along with 1 large chopped onion, 2      minced cloves of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary, 1/2      teaspoon caraway seeds, 2 tablespoons tomato paste and a      bay leaf-until the vegetables are tender (about half      an hour). Fish out the bay leaf and add salt and pepper to      taste, also 2 tablespoons of margarine or butter. Half a      minute in a blender will reduce the soup to a velvet      smoothness.    </p>    <p>      From The Complete Sprouting Cookbook by Karen Cross Whyte,      Troubador Press, copyright © 1973 by author.    </p>

Start a garden in your kitchen cabinet by [1] soaking clean, whole untreated seeds overnight in three times their volume of water, [2] placing the swelled beans, oats, alfalfa or whatever in a canning jar with a cheesecloth or screen wire cover, [3] tipping the container up at 45? angle in a bowl, [4] setting the bowl in a warm (room temperature to 90?F), dark place and [5] flushing the developing sprouts with clean water every four or six hours (twice a day?morning and evening?will usually work almost as well). In three to six days the shoots can be added to salads, sprinkled on soups, blended into health drinks, baked into bread, used as meatloaf filler, enjoyed in stew or eaten a hundred other ways.
