        <h3>Solar Slates</h3><p>After several years of research on solar technology, we had our south-facing roof replaced with photovoltaic (PV) Sunslates. These imported lifetime slates, although heavier than composition shingles, are lighter than a tile roof. We have the first roof of this solar slate technology in northern California’s Tuolumne County. With it we power all of our electrical appliances and a pool pump. Atlantis Energy Systems of Sacramento is the importer <em>[(916) 438-2930; www.atlantisenergy.org]</em>. The slates are rather expensive, but there are state and federal rebates available. We have not received an electric bill in two years.</p><p><em>Doug Daniels<br />Sonora, California</em></p><h3>Easy Jeans Patch</h3><p>To fix a hole in a pair of jeans so it will not continue to unravel, paint the edges of the hole with acrylic paint. When it is dry, the paint will not dissolve in water.</p><p><br /><em>David Medcalf<br />Lemitar, New Mexico</em></p><h3>Warm Hands</h3><p>Keeping hands warm can be quite a challenge for home mechanics working on automobiles in cold garages during the winter. One useful method of combating the cold is to wear a thin pair of disposable latex gloves. These inexpensive gloves are available in packages of a dozen at hardware and auto parts stores. The gloves keep your hands warm, and they keep them clean as well.</p><p>If this isn’t enough, fill a 2-liter plastic bottle with hot water and wrap it in towels to retain heat. Then when your hands need warming, grasp the bottle in both hands while enjoying a pleasant few minutes of rest.</p><p><em>Joyce Rusch<br />Santa Cruz, California</em></p><h3>Chicken Yards</h3><p>I made a modification to the concept of a chicken tractor (movable pen) in order to more efficiently accommodate one in my garden. Instead of a pen that I move around the garden, I divided my garden into three sections, and put a coop that has access to each of the sections in the center. I use one section each year to raise chickens (like crop rotation).</p><p>When it comes time to plant my crops I move the chickens to another section. Then I buy several round bales of hay or straw, and unroll them in the garden, leaving a small gap between for planting seeds. This takes care of the problem of mulching, and when the garden is finished producing vegetables for the season, the chickens have a field day scratching in the remnants.</p><p><em>Thomas Ledbetter<br />New London, North Carolina</em></p><h3>Recipe Organizer</h3><p>Having trouble getting all those recipes organized? Try using a loose-leaf photograph album. The recipes slide easily in and out of the clear pockets, and the plastic protects the recipes from the inevitable spills and splashes. Add some stick-on divider tabs to separate categories (appetizers, casseroles, desserts), and you’ll always know where to find that favorite recipe.on’t forget to include the picture that prompted you to cut the recipe out of the magazine in the first place. Best of all, as your recipe collection grows, additional pages are always available.</p><p><em>Sharon DuBois<br />Topeka, Kansas</em></p><h3>Family Business</h3><p>I grew up during the Great Depression, when work was hard to find. My father adapted by starting our family business - making and selling baskets. I have passed it on to my children just as my father passed it on to me. These baskets are rustic because they are made of vines instead of reeds. We use coat-hanger wire to frame the baskets. The only other raw materials are the free vines. When we pull the vines down from trees, we help the trees to thrive. Even private property owners let us harvest the vines that harm their trees.</p><p>We took this business to a new level when we began bending and welding together heavier-gauge wire and iron rods to create frames for artistic creations such as wheelbarrows, wishing wells, gazebos and various wild animals. The main materials for these creations are still vines of varying thickness.</p><p>We have sold these creations wholesale to florists and greenhouse owners. We also have sold them at retail prices to individuals at arts and crafts shows, and by simple word of mouth. The “family business” has helped us to supplement our other income and be self-sufficient during tough economic times.</p><p><em>Jack Vale<br />Zolfo Springs, Florida</em></p><h3>Chickens Rock!</h3><p>Chickens may have saved my family’s life. A few years ago, we moved onto a farm on a beautiful meadow with a lot of rocks. I used to love the idea of rocks in my yard until I learned that rocks meant rattlesnakes.</p><p>Our first year, we had eight rattlesnakes near the house. I have a little girl and was quite concerned; I even thought we might have to move. We purchased 12 chickens that summer. The next year, we had no rattlesnakes around the house even though our neighbors still did. I figured out this was due to the chickens, which were very active, scratching every inch of ground in a one-acre area at least twice a day.</p><p>Besides helping with the snake problem, chickens do many other jobs for us. They work all day laying eggs and eating pests, especially earwigs and fly larvae, in the goat and cow manure. The chickens go to bed at night by themselves, and the rooster is an excellent alarm clock. They are the best ranch workers I’ve ever had.</p><p><em>Mila Johansen<br />Penn Valley, California</em></p><h3>Running of the Dogs</h3><p><br />If your image of a dog sled team conjures up pictures of Alaska’s 1,100-mile Iditarod race, think again. Mushers come in all shapes and sizes, and dog teams, like engines or saw blades, can be fitted for all kinds of jobs.</p><p><br />My family lives in Warren, N.H., on the edge of White Mountain National Forest. We have a four-dog team that hauls us through miles of northern landscape in every season. In summer, we attach them to mountain bikes. In autumn, they pull us uphill when we hike. In winter, of course, we use sleds. We also hook them to a skijor rig, which is a fancy term for nothing more than attaching one or two dogs to a gangline, then letting them pull you - as fast as 20 mph - on a pair of cross-country skis for a wild and exhilarating ride.</p><p>When it’s time to work, we can hook our team to a cargo or toboggan and use them to haul freight. A four-dog team can pull a 200-pound person 10 miles at an average speed of 15 mph, so they have no problem pulling a bundle or two of kindling, or several buckets of newly tapped maple syrup. They also can follow a snowmobile trail just about anywhere, and there’s nothing quite like visiting a neighbor’s house on a sled.</p><p>Dog sledding may not be for everyone, but on a small scale it is far less complicated than you may imagine. We use four Alaskan sled dogs - Muppin, Charlie, Willow and Laika - but most draft dogs will do as well. (Try Siberians or Malamutes if you intend to pull greater weights, because they tend to be larger.)</p><p>Nearly every northern state boasts a sled dog club, and the clubs prove a boon for anyone thinking about getting into the sport. Attend a few races. Watch the classifieds. You might check www.sleddog central.com, or nooksackracing.com; both are excellent Web sites for mushers. Unless you are considering running the dogs in races, you needn’t acquire first-string dogs. Look for ads that admit a dog is no longer fast enough for the owner’s team, or search for older, more dependable dogs. Also, scan the pages carefully in the spring when mushers are weeding out dogs from their competitive teams. Thanks to good friends and careful research, we have never paid for a dog. Good owners are happy to see their retired-racing dogs go to responsible friends and neighbors who will provide the dogs with the kind of lives they deserve.</p><p><br />Wouldn’t a snowmobile be easier? Sure it would. But when our son stands on the runners of the sled, ready to guide the team over a six-mile trail, I inevitably feel pride. The dogs are part of our day, so ingrained in the fabric of our hours that we could not imagine life without them. They are as distinct in our minds as we are to each other. And when they come to a distraction, or to a possible turnoff, and my son shouts, “On-by,” I watch with joy as the dogs skim along, not turning but following the training we have given them.</p><p><em>Joe Monninger<br />Warren, New Hampshire</em></p><h3>Ode to My Trusty Swiss Army Knife</h3><p>Ever since it was given to me by my sister as a college graduation congratulation, my Swiss army knife has been my favorite tool. Not too heavy, not too light, it has served me food, repaired a million broken things, screwed and unscrewed screws, untied knots, cut twine, fished out lost items, cleaned my nails, revealed the intricacies of life and nature under its wee magnifying glass and harvested broccoli, kohlrabi, lettuce and more. It is my constant companion. Together we’ve toured the United States by train, flown and ferried around Scotland, and been to Timbuktu and back. For over a year, my first as a Peace Corps volunteer, it was my only knife. The second year, a blacksmith friend crafted me another blade. It was he whom I trusted to carefully and artfully sharpen both blades on my dear tool.</p><p>When I am separated from my knife, I reach for it often. It’s funny to be so attached to a tool, but it’s so ubiquitously useful. I am grateful. Thanks, Sis!</p><p><em>Carolyn Llewellyn<br />Barre, Massachusetts</em></p><h3>Hooked on Her Scythe</h3><p>I love my scythe. No doubt about it - it is perfect. With an aluminum snath (handle) and Austrian blade, it is a virtual multitasker, albeit a nontraditional model. It cuts weeds under the fruit trees where the brush hog can’t go - the tip can cleverly snag weeds around tender plants and fences, and it has been known to cut a mighty path through weeds short and tall. Amazingly, you can talk while you use it, hear the birds sing, chickens cluck and goats call. My husband at first chided my purchase, but he too has seen the beauty and simplicity of the “Wonder that is the Scythe.”</p><p><em>Mary Jane Phifer<br />Woodford, Virginia</em></p><h3>Versatile Fencing Pliers<br /></h3><p>Now, while I love new tools, the one tool that I’ve never had to replace has been my fencing pliers. No matter what I have to fix or do, the job can usually be done by my good ol’ fencing pliers. This tool works like a pair of pliers, cuts wire, pounds nails and pulls out fencing nails. It also works great for picking up scorpions and depositing them elsewhere. I’ve even used it in a pinch to dig a hole for a geranium the cat dug out. For some reason, I’m always breaking handles or pulling the metal parts off the handles. I’d have to say that my fencing pliers are No. 1 on my list, followed by that roll of duct tape and baling twine.</p><p><br /><em>Laurie McCaslin<br />Pahrump, Nevada</em></p><h3>Handy Circle Hoe</h3><p>I am a grower of vegetables and flowers. I have a tool that is wonderful: It is the circle hoe. Instead of the flat surface of a regular hoe, it has a 3-inch circle head on a long handle. The tool is perfect for getting the weeds between plants. Its small head allows it to fit into tight spaces, and the long handle eliminates the need to work on my hands and knees.</p><p><em>Angel Franklin<br />Junction City, California</em></p>
