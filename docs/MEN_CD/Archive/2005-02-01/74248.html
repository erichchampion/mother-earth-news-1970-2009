            		    <h5 id="byline">      By Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      Fresh or frozen, peas are among the most versatile of all      vegetables. They are naturals for Asian stir-fried dishes      laced with ginger, garlic and sesame oil, and their vibrant      green adds color to pasta dishes. Peas also can be used to      make a delicious puréed soup, or you can enjoy them      in fruit-and-vegetable salads composed of peas and      pineapple or orange sections, dressed with a sesame-scented      vinaigrette. And of course there are the classic veggie      pairings: peas with carrots, peas with cauliflower, peas      with pearl onions.    </p>    <p>      It is but a happy accident that peas’ fine flavor and      vibrant good looks are matched by great nutrition. All peas      are a good source of calcium, iron and vitamins A and C,      and those with edible pods provide plenty of dietary fiber      and make terrific snack food.    </p>    <p>      The “homegrown” difference between fresh and      not-so-fresh peas must be tasted to be believed. Only      gardeners and their customers know the sweet, crisp flavor      of fresh peas, be they shell peas, snow peas or plump snap      peas. If you grow all three types or buy them from your      local farmer’s market, you’ll have everything      you need to explore pea cuisine - the source of      several crazes in the history of food. In 1696, Madame de      Maintenon, wife of French King Louis XIV, recorded that      “Some ladies, even after having supped at the Royal      Table, and well supped too, returning to their homes, at      the risk of suffering from indigestion, will again eat peas      before going to bed. It is both a fashion and a      madness.”    </p>        <p>      The peas she mentioned were early strains of English shell      peas, so-named because English breeders developed many      fine-flavored varieties in the centuries that followed.      Today, in addition to shell peas, we can also enjoy the      edible pods of snow and snap peas. Often associated with      Asian food, snow peas have flat pods, while snap peas      feature thicker pods that are more round than flat. Snap      peas are now available in the frozen food section of every      major supermarket, and because they produce more food per      square foot than other peas and freeze beautifully, they      are the favorite of many gardeners.    </p>    <p>      Market gardeners love them, too. “They sell very      easily if you give people samples, and it’s great to      hear the crunch as they bite into them,” says Kevin      Wilson of Powell River, British Columbia, who harvested 27      pounds of snap peas from a 20-foot quadruple row last      spring, and then sold them at a farmer’s market by      the pint. Snow peas yield lower because the pods are not as      fat, but they, too, can make a profitable crop, and the      young leaves of some snow peas are good to eat in salads.      The pods of English peas are too tough to eat, so the      harvest is limited to the plants’ succulent immature      seeds, which are so far superior to canned peas that      there’s hardly a way to compare them.    </p>    <h3>      <em>More Productive Peas</em>    </h3>        <p>      Peas require cool temperatures, below 80 degrees, so they      grow best in areas where cool spring weather lasts well      into early summer. Maine, Wisconsin and the Pacific      Northwest have the best climates for peas, but anyone who      plants promptly in early spring can grow a good crop. To      make sure peas mature before the weather turns hot, plant      them three or more weeks before the last spring frost.      Young pea plants have no trouble surviving late cold snaps,      and the seeds often are willing to germinate under late      snow.    </p>    <p>      Peas are nitrogen-fixing legumes, a miracle that involves      an interaction between pea roots and several strains of      soil-borne bacteria. As long as the soil is reasonably      fertile and contains a little nitrogen left from the      previous crop, no further feeding is normally needed. An      appropriate soil pH of about 6.5 is important for smooth      operation of the nitrogen-fixing process, and the bacteria      need to be present, too. They usually are present in soil      where peas have been grown previously, but it’s cheap      and easy to inoculate pea seed with N-fixing bacteria. You      can buy the inoculant at garden centers (it works with      beans, too). Just wet the seeds, then shake them in a jar      with the powdered inoculant before planting. However,      it’s always wise to amend the soil with a half inch      to 1 inch of compost before planting peas.    </p>    <p>      Peas benefit from dense planting, in which the plants are      only 2 inches apart in the row. Wilson plants peas in      quadruple rows, with two rows of peas on each side of a      trellis in a 3-foot-wide bed. At Peregrine Farm in Alamance      County, N.C., organic farmers Alex and Betsy Hitt use the      quadruple-row strategy to grow big crops of snap peas;      their approach will work with other types of peas, as well.    </p>        <p>      “Our standard pea-planting method is two rows of a      tall pea, like ‘Sugar Snap,’ with rows of a      shorter variety on either side,” Alex Hitt says.      “A trellis goes down the middle, between the two rows      of ‘Sugar Snaps.’ This arrangement helps the      tall variety stay upright until it begins to tendril and      grab the trellis. Because the tall variety does not really      produce any peas below 24 inches, this gives us production      lower down, and a few days earlier, from the shorter      variety.” Hitt doesn’t think much of short      varieties in terms of flavor or productivity, but he      believes they help tall varieties grow better.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The following seed companies offer large      selections, including collections that let you sample      several<br />      varieties in a season:</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Johnny’s Selected Seeds<br />      955 Benton Ave.<br />      Winslow, ME 04910<br />      (800) 879-2258<br />      <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com" target="_blank">www.johnnyseeds.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Nichols Garden Nursery<br />      1190 Old Salem Road N.E.<br />      Albany, OR 97321<br />      (800) 422-3985<br />      <a href="http://www.nicholsgardennursery.com" target="_blank">www.nicholsgardennursery.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Park Seed<br />      1 Parkton Ave.<br />      Greenwood, SC 29647<br />      (800) 213-0076<br />      <a href="http://www.parkseed.com" target="_blank">www.parkseed.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Territorial Seed<br />      P.O.

If you plan to follow peas with a nonvining crop,      a simple string trellis attached to posts is great because      you can cut it down and compost the string and spent vines      together. Nylon or plastic net trellising (sold by garden      supply companies for less than $10 for a 5-by-15-foot      piece) attached to posts also works well. Many gardeners      follow peas with cucumbers, pole beans or another vining      crop, so they install a secure trellis made of wire mesh,      and keep it in service all summer long.    </p>    <p>      A super low-maintenance trellising idea comes from David      Fisher and Anna Maclay, owners of Natural Roots organic      farm in Conway, Mass. They grow peas on upright oats: Using      a walk-behind seeder, they plant one oat seed for every      five or six peas. “The oats and peas grow at the same      rate, and reach the same height of about 30 inches,”      Fisher says. The method works with shell, snow and snap      peas, and later on, the farm’s livestock get to clean      up the row.    </p>    <p>      And then there’s the old practice of supporting peas      with small limbs gleaned from early spring fruit tree      pruning. This type of twig trellis works fine with peas      that grow less than 30 inches tall, but taller varieties      require more substantial support.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Harvesting Peas</em>    </h3>    <p>      When planted in cool, rich soil and given something to      climb on, peas pretty much grow themselves. Then comes the      fun part, picking the peas - which is not without its      challenges. The sugar content of peas increases as pods      approach ripeness and quickly converts to starch as the      seeds become mature. With snow peas and snap peas, overripe      specimens also get tough and stringy, so check your peas      daily when you think they’re almost ripe.    </p>    <p>      Harvest English peas before the pods become waxy and when      the peas are plump and sweet. Pick snow peas when the      little peas just begin to swell in the pods. With snap      peas, do not be misled by the flat pods sometimes found in      your supermarket. Young specimens store and ship well, but      they do not have the high sugar content of perfectly ripe      snap peas. “It’s a mistake to harvest snap peas      too early or too late,” Hitt says. “Pick them      when they have begun to show the individual swell of each      pea in the pod. Before that, they have not produced the      maximum amount of sugar, and after that, they become tough      and pithy.”    </p>        <p>      The dried peas used to make pea soup are grown just like      other peas, and then allowed to mature until the pods begin      to dry. A few seed companies still sell the      ‘Alaska’ variety, but many more choices bear      brown, yellow or green peas, and some bear pretty purple      pods.an Jason at Salt Spring Seeds on Salt Spring Island,      British Columbia, keeps one of the best selections. Salt      Spring’s online catalog is available at      www.saltspringseeds.com, or you can write to Salt Spring      Seeds, Box 444, Ganges, Salt Spring Island, BC, Canada      V8K2W1. For more pea sources, see “Picking Pea      Varieties”.    </p>        <h3>      <em>Storing Peas</em>    </h3>    <p>      Peas cook so quickly that their flavor suffers when they      are canned, but they are a cinch to freeze. If you grow a      nice crop or find them at a farmer’s market, freezing      is a simple matter of dumping the cleaned peas or pods into      boiling water for a minute, scooping them out and putting      them into a bowl of ice water, and then packing them into      containers. Fill freezer bags with blanched, cooled peas      and then lay the filled bags flat on a cookie sheet in the      freezer. When the bags are frozen hard, they can be neatly      stacked into their permanent place in the freezer. When      frozen, English peas and snap peas keep well for a year,      but snow peas are best used within a few months.    </p>    <h3>      Eat Your Pea Greens    </h3>    <p>      When Washington State University (WSU) Extension      researchers noticed pea vines selling for several dollars a      pound at Pike Place Market in Seattle, they launched a      two-year study to evaluate the edibility of various types      of pea foliage. After looking at a dozen varieties,      including shell, snap, snow, split and marrowfat peas (the      type of pea that is fried into snack food puffs), a tasting      panel of chefs, farmers and Extension agents agreed that      4-inch-long tops from young snow peas produced the best      greens. “Pea shoots make a great addition to salad      mix, which is the most popular way of eating shoots in the      United States right now,” says Dr. Carol Miles, the      WSU agricultural systems specialist who directed the study.      Miles says you can lightly cook pea shoots, too, or they      can be used as an edible garnish.    </p>    <h3>      Picking Pea Varieties    </h3>    <p>      There are a few things to look for as you shop for pea      seed. If you live in a climate where spring is short,      choose fast-maturing varieties such as ‘Sugar      Sprint’ snap pea, ‘Oregon Sugar Pod II’      snow pea or ‘Dakota’ shell pea, all of which      mature about 60 days after seeding. Powdery mildew      resistance is easy to come by, but if you live in the      Northwest also look for resistance to Pea Enation Mosaic      Virus, available in ‘Cascadia’ snap pea,      ‘Oregon Giant’ snow pea and many others.      Small-space gardeners will get more peas per square foot      with taller varieties such as ‘Super Sugar      Snap,’ but shorter ones bear all at once, which is      helpful if you plan to freeze your peas.    </p>
