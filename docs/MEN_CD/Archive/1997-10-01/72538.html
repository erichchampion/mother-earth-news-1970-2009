                <p>      <strong>Energy & Environment</strong>    </p>    <p>      The reinvention of the battery makes solar more practical      than ever.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Bruce Bownell    </h5>            <p>      When the Soviets launched Sputnik, the world's first      man-made satellite, the era of American invincibility was      over barely twelve years after Hiroshima marked its      beginning. I'm part of the generation spurred by Sputnik      and the space race it engendered. One of the first      technological hurdles to be overcome was also one of the      most basic. How to produce electricity on-board? Batteries      light enough to launch would never power on-board      electronics for a fraction of the time necessary, so a way      to constantly generate power had to be developed. In the      pursuit of that power, a minor miracle was accomplished.      Juiced by a virtual blank check from the U.S. government,      scientists were able to invent the photovoltaic (PV) panel,      which not only made it possible for us to visit the moon,      but also slightly less remote regions of the earth.    </p>    <p>      Readers of MOTHER are no strangers to the dizzying ride      solar energy has taken, from our best hope of unlimited      power in the early seventies, to complete disrepute in the      Reagan/Bush era, to a small but promising resurgence today.      Technological progress has been frustratingly slow, thanks      to a complete lack of governmental interest and the recent      relative stability of fossil fuel prices. Finally, in the      last half of the '90s with the development of slightly      improved PV panels integrated with newly available      computer-based controllers and inverters, we are again at a      threshold for PV to become widely used.    </p>    <p>      Many new developments are coming not from the      industrialized nations but from the third world. In the      absence of large integrated electrical transmission systems      (grids), third world countries are beginning to see the      wisdom of independent power production for each home. One      can now begin to predict the economic success of PV's      future in the United States as well, as the cost of output      falls slowly while conventional power costs slowly rise.      It's a good bet that there will be a period of price      fluctuation when more electrical utilities are deregulated      (California, Massachusetts and Rhode Island residents will      be permitted to buy power from whoever they like as of      January 1,1998, and more state deregulation is close on      their heels.), but it is inevitable that fossil      fuel-produced power costs will increase. Demand will rise      across the first decade of the new century, driven by world      population increases and the rapid spread of an electrical      lifestyle to the countryside of China, Russia, Africa, and      South America.    </p>    <p>      Many installations will incorporate, in addition to a PV      system, some combination of micro-hydroelectric, wind power      and a backup fossil fueled generator. These sources will be      integrated to battery storage and the home by the new      generation of computer controlled multi-function inverters.      These systems will yield power availability and quality      nearly as reliably as today's grid at these remote sites.    </p>    <p>      The remaining weak links in this promised lifestyle are      batteries, devices which haven't changed much in the better      part of a century. Lead-acid batteries still need to be      carefully watched (and in some instances watered), and      money should be set aside for their replacement      (approximately every ten years). Their toxic nature demands      a separate "battery house" as well as mandatory re cycling.      An auto industry-government consortium is hard at work      improving batteries for the electric car revolution, and      the most promising developments of that program are fuel      cells, which store power upon charging by splitting water      (H 2 O) into it's respective atoms. The atoms are stored as      oxygen and hydrogen, and electrical power is released by      recombining these same atoms across a membrane. Instead of      having to deal with an ecological nightmare that is a used      lead-acid battery the only waste byproduct of these new      fuel cells is water.    </p>    <p>      Fuel cells power the space shuttle with a design several      generations older than current models. More recently, some      city buses and experimental cars have used fuel cells to      store their energy. Some companies have small experimental      1 & 2 KW sized modules, which hopefully will also      become practical and affordable as the technology advances      and market demand increases. This will lead to the second      wave of independent living as the middle class, both here      and abroad, will be able to embrace PV with it's new found      alliances with computer-based controls and trouble-free      fuel cells. The convenience factor will now be appropriate,      and independent electrical production will just be another      appliance that Americans will enjoy.    </p>    <h3>Can You Live a Solar Life?</h3>    <p>      A single occupancy small apartment in which cooking and hot      water are supplied by gas uses an average of 192 KWH per      month, or 6.4 KWH per day. A single occupancy country      residence would use slightly more power, say 8-10 KWH per      day.    </p>    <p>      A country home with two parents and two teenage children      using heat and hot water from natural gas will use 958 KWH      per month, or 31.7 KWH per day.    </p>    <p>      Although system costs are still slowly dropping, a PV power      system capable of supplying the latter country home could      easily tip the scales at over $50,000. Now if the choice is      between this and extending the power grid a few miles to      your new country home, paying the utility $10 -$15 a foot      to do it, such an investment would pay for itself the      minute you turned it on. For the rest of us who live life      "on the grid," paying the better part of a year's salary as      a hedge against future rises in utility power costs would      be impossible.    </p>    <p>      The concept at loggerheads here is, as you can see, what we      can get from PV versus the power that we have come to      accept as necessary. A PV powered home not funded by a      millionaire would, by necessity, feature no air      conditioning, no electrical heating appliances of any kind,      and very few large electrical motors such as washers and      dryers. Such a home would need to be heated and cooled by      design rather than by utility. Passive solar heating would      need to augment a wood stove in winter, and well-designed      ventilation would have to do the job of summer cooling.    </p>    <p>      Solar energy's biggest problem and at the same time most      encouraging feature is that it demands that we re-think      every light switch and appliance, every needless waste of      energy in our homes. For a country which has 5 percent of      the world's population but uses 20 percent of the world's      fuel supply, such an investment of time would not only save      money in the short-term, but resources far more precious.    </p>
