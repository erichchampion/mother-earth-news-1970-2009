                <p>      <strong>Mother's Kitchen</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>When your son asks, "What's a rolling pin?" it's      time to put him to work using one.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>            <p>      N ot long ago I sent my mother a card showing a '50s photo      of a June Cleaver look-alike rolling out a pie crust. The      inside caption read, " I don't know what she's doing      either. Must be some kind of ancient household ritual."      Which brings me to why I'm writing about pie-making in the      fast-paced '90s. Besides the fact that my editor and I both      love pies, the truth is that I fear for the ancient      household ritual. As soon as the year 2000, rolling pins      could become artifacts. (Just the other day in an antique      store I heard a teenage girl ask her mother the purpose of      this artifact.) At this very moment my teenage son is      rolling out a pie crust and muttering words that aren't      allowed in this house. All because I don't want homemade      pies to be nothing more than a happy memory because the art      died out with his generation of the Vassal-Bokram clan. I      don't think my two sisters could make a pie to save their      lives. (Bye, bye Miss American Pie) I don't want future      generations to think that pies are born in bakeries.    </p>        <p>      When I was first married, I used to make lots of pies. I      pursued my pie-baking hobby after buying a vintage rolling      pin at a flea market. I found it relaxing, rolling out the      dough and seeing if I could make it resemble a circle.      (I've often thought I could make millions by inventing a      square pie pan.) Back then I was big on whole grains,      natural sweeteners, and tons of butter. For '90s pies, I've      had to cut back on fat and time since I'm not hanging      around the stove all day. For those reasons, I rarely make      a double-crusted pie. I usually resort to quick-bake,      no-bake, or an occasional store-bought pie shell. But I      have found that in the food processor age, pie baking can      be faster and easier than it was in the good ole days. And      since homemade pies are rare, they're impressive. (Wow,      Herbie, did you see that fabulous round thing that Phyllis      made?) So dig out that rolling pin and relax a little.      Don't forget, you're leaving a legacy.    </p>    <p>      Here are some easy, basic pie crusts.    </p>    <h3>Food Processor Whole Wheat Pie Crust*</h3>    <p>      Makes one 9-inch crust    </p>        <p>      <em>1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour (or un</em>      <em>bleached white flour if pastry flour is un      available)<br />      1/2 cup unbleached white flour<br />      2 tablespoons unsalted butter, well chilled<br />      3 tablespoons soy or safflower margarine, frozen<br />      pinch of salt<br />      2-3 tablespoons cold water</em>    </p>    <p>      Put all the ingredients in a food processor except the      water. Pulse the dough about 4 or 5 times until there are      pea-sized butter balls. Drizzle a little water and pulse      until it starts to clump together a bit, adding more water      if necessary. Don't over mix; the dough should have little      bits of butter in it. Empty the dough onto a large sheet of      wax paper and shape it into a ball. Flatten the ball into a      half-inch circle and wrap it in plastic wrap. Freeze for 10      minutes if you're going to roll it out immediately.      Otherwise, the dough can be refrigerated for up to a week      or frozen for up to two months.    </p>        <p>      * For a non-dairy, vegan crust, replace soy margarine for      butter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Processed by Hand Crust</strong> (For an upper body      workout.)    </p>    <p>      Have a large, shallow mixing bowl and a pastry blender      handy. (A pastry blender is a hand-held utensil with      whisk-like wires for mixing. A strong fork will also work      in a pinch.) The butter and margarine don't need to be as      cold since there's no danger of overprocessing by hand.      Mash the butter and margarine into the flour with the      pastry blender until there are pea-sized balls of dough.      Add just enough water to get the dough to stick together.      Empty out on wax paper and work the dough just until it's      blended. Roll into a ball and proceed as above.    </p>    <h3>Roll, Roll, Roll Your Dough</h3>        <p>      Here's the part that scares some people but it's really      quite easy; just regress a bit and pretend it's Play-doh.      Here we go:    </p>    <p>      • Place the flattened dough circle on a large piece of      wax paper with another piece covering the top. Roll and      press the rolling pin from the center of the dough away      from you. Then turn the waxed paper an inch or so clockwise      and roll again. Keep it up until you are all the way      around.    </p>    <p>      • You now have a weird looking circle. Don't panic.      Peel off the waxed paper and put it back on the dough. Flip      over, peel off the other piece, and put it back on. (The      waxed paper gets crumpled, and this will fix it.) Repeat      the rolling ritual until the circle is one inch bigger than      the inverted pie pan.    </p>        <p>      • Keep cutting off any pieces of dough that deviate      from the circle and use them to patch up the bare spots.      Eventually you'll end up with enough of a circle to call it      a pie. Try not to work the dough to death because that will      toughen it. Peel off the top waxed paper and invert the      dough onto the pie pan, centering it before peeling off the      other waxed paper.    </p>    <p>      • Pat the dough into the pan. Turn the ragged edges      under so that they're even with the rim of the pan. Here's      the fun part, crimping the edging. There are a number of      ways to do it; here's my method. Press your left index      finger against the inside rim of the pie while your right      thumb is pressing the outer rim on an angle. Keep moving      the pan counterclockwise until the pie is finished.    </p>    <h3>A Partially Baked and Baked Crust:</h3>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lay a piece of foil inside      the crust and covering the rim. Press down lightly so the      foil is pressing against the dough. Some cooks weigh the      foil down with uncooked beans, but I don't usually bother      with it. If the crust puffs up anywhere, just press it down      or deflate it by poking a hole with a fork. For a partially      baked crust, bake for 7-8 minutes. The crust will be puffy      and starting to harden. Remove and cool a few minutes      before adding the filling. Bake according to directions.      For a baked crust, do all the above and remove the foil      (beans) after 7-8 minutes. Stab the bottom of the crust a      few times with a fork and bake for another 5 minutes or so      until the crust is lightly browned. Remove and cool on a      rack. Add the filling and refrigerate according to      directions.    </p>    <h3>      Graham Cracker Crust</h3>        <p>      Why use a store-bought graham cracker crust when this is so      easy and tastes so much better? I use a natural graham      cracker such as "Hain" or "Frookie."    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup crushed graham crackers (about 6 whole      crackers)</em> <em><br /></em> <em>2 tablespoons brown      sugar, packed<br />      1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      3 tablespoons melted butter</em>    </p>    <p>      Break up the crackers into small pieces. Place in a food      processor and pulse until there are fine crumbs, not      powder. (Or... Put the crackers in a large, zip-lock      freezer bag and crush with a rolling pin.) Add the rest of      the ingredients and pulse 2-3 times just until blended.      Using a 9-inch pie pan or springform pan, pat the crust      around the sides up to the rim, making a flat edge with      your fingers. Make sure the edge isn't too thin, or it will      burn easily. Evenly pat down the bottom of the crust. Bake      for 20-25 minutes at 325°F until it starts to brown.      The crust will still be a little crumbly. Add filling and      bake, or cool first before adding the filling for a      refrigerated pie.    </p>    <p>      Or... Chocolate Graham Cracker Crust    </p>    <p>      Some pies taste better with a chocolate crust. Just use      chocolate graham crackers and omit the cinnamon.    </p>    <h3>Key Lime Pie</h3>    <p>      Graham cracker crust in a 9-inch springform pan, baked (see      above).    </p>    <p>      <em>4 egg yolks</em> <em><br />      2/3</em> <em>cup fresh lime juice<br />      1 tablespoon grated lime rind<br />      1 (14-ounce) can low-fat sweetened condensed milk</em>    </p>    <p>      Topping.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 pint whipping cream<br /></em> <em>2 tablespoons      sugar or to taste<br /></em> <em>I teaspoon vanilla</em>    </p>    <p>      Bake crust and let cool on a rack while you prepare the      filling. Preheat oven to 350°F. In a mixing bowl, whisk      the yolks until creamy. Whisk in the rest of the      ingredients. Pour into the crust and bake for 30 minutes      until the center of the pie is as firm as the exterior.      (Touch with your finger.) Let cool for one hour at room      temperature. Then refrigerate until serving. Just before      serving, whip the cream and spread a thin layer over the      pie. Decorate each piece with a lime slice or lime zest.      It's best eaten the same day since, after a day or so, the      crust will soften.    </p>    <h3>      Apple Cider Pie <em>Vegan</em>    </h3>    <p>      It's up to you if you want to peel the apples. I don't like      to take the time and waste the fiber so I choose      thin-skinned apples. (A store-bought Granny Smith has a      thick, tough skin.) Usually I use whatever apples are left      out in my root cellar such as Pippin, Fuji, Gala, Empire,      or Mutsu.    </p>        <p>      Prepare one 9-inch whole wheat pie crust and partially      bake. (See above.) Leave the oven temperature set at      425°F.    </p>    <p>      Pie Filling:    </p>    <p>      <em>10 medium-sized firm apples</em> <em><br />      2 tablespoons maple syrup<br />      1/2 cup apple cider (1 use unfiltered cider.)<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/4 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      1 tablespoon arrowroot flour</em>    </p>    <p>      Cut the apples in quarters, cut out the seeds, and slice      across into quarter-inch slices. Put in a large, nonstick      skillet with the maple syrup, 1/4 cup of the cider,      cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cover and cook on medium heat for 10      minutes, stirring every few minutes. Meanwhile, in a small      bowl, whisk the arrowroot flour into the remaining 1/4 cup      cider. Add to the apples and cook on medium-high heat      uncovered until the juice bubbles and thickens. Remove from      heat and let cool for a few minutes before evenly spooning      the filling into the pie shell.    </p>    <p>      Topping:    </p>    <p>      <em>1/3cup each: brown sugar, whole wheat pastry flour,      chopped walnuts<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      2 tablespoons soy margarine or butter, well chilled</em>    </p>    <p>      Cut the margarine or butter into small cubes. In a food      processor, pulse the sugar and flour. Add the rest of the      ingredients and pulse until small pebbles are formed (or      use a hand pastry blender). Remove and press evenly onto      the pie. Put your hand over the edge of the crust as you      get near the edges so the topping stays on the pie. Place      the pie in the center of the oven with a piece of foil on      the bottom shelf to catch drips. Reduce oven temperature      from 425°F to 375°F. Bake for 40-45 minutes until      browned. Cool at least one hour on a rack before slicing so      the juices can solidify.    </p>    <h3>Whiskey Sweet Potato Pie</h3>    <p>      The whiskey really makes this pie, but you can make it      without the booze. This was a good way to use up some      liquor that was left at our house.    </p>    <p>      Prepare one 9-inch whole wheat pie crust and partially      bake. (See above.)    </p>    <p>      <em>3 cups sweet potatoes; cooked, peeled, and mashed</em>      <em><br /></em> <em>3 eggs<br />      1/4 cup real maple syrup (or honey is OK)<br />      1/3 cup brown sugar, packed<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon<br />      1 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br />      1/8 teaspoon allspice<br />      2 tablespoons Scotch whiskey</em>    </p>    <p>      Start cooking the sweet potatoes while you prepare the      crust. Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the 3 cups mashed      sweet potatoes in a blender when they've cooled. Add the      rest of the ingredients and blend until smooth. Pour into      the pie crust and place in the center of the oven. Bake      50-55 minutes until an inserted knife in the pie's center      comes out almost clean. Cool for at least one hour on a      rack before slicing. Place a spoonful of whipped cream on      each slice if you wish. Refrigerate any leftovers.    </p>    <h3>Mocha Ice Cream Pie</h3>    <p>      This is the world's easiest pie so have the kids help you      on this one. You can use whatever ice cream flavor you      prefer so go ahead and experiment.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 chocolate graham cracker crust (above)</em><br />      <em>2 pints coffee, espresso, or cappuccino frozen yogurt      or low fat ice cream</em>    </p>    <p>      Drizzle Topping:    </p>    <p>      <em>1/4 cup chocolate chips (I use barley malt      sweetened.)</em> <em><br /></em> <em>2-3 tablespoons milk      or soy milk</em>    </p>    <p>      I prefer a 9-inch springform pan for this recipe because      it's easier to serve, but you can use a pie pan if you      like. Press the chocolate graham cracker mixture into the      bottom of the springform pan and about one inch up the      sides. Bake according to the above directions and cool      thoroughly. If the ice cream is rock-hard, let it sit out      for 10 minutes or so until soft enough to handle.    </p>    <p>      In the meantime, make the drizzle by melting the chocolate      chips in a small sauce pan on low heat. Whisk in the milk      until the chocolate is thin enough to drizzle off a spoon      and remove from heat. Spoon the ice cream carefully into      the crust until you've emptied the cartons. Smooth out the      ice cream with a spoon or spatula. Heat up the drizzle      topping again. Coat a teaspoon with chocolate and drizzle      zigzag lines across the whole pie until it's covered. (If      you put too much chocolate on the spoon it'll leave      chocolate puddles instead of lines.) Freeze an hour or two      until the pie is hardened. Let it sit out a few minutes      before cutting.    </p>    <p>      Topping ideas:    </p>    <p>      yogurt or "lite" sour cream.    </p>    <h3>The Great Pie Crust Dilemma</h3>    <p>      When it comes to pie crust, we have one little      problem-the fat. I'm not even trying to make fat-free      pies. I'll settle for less fat and easy on the sugar. Now      the dilemma: which fat should I use? As I roam the Midwest      in search of the perfect pie (and I came close at a diner      in northern Wisconsin), the pie experts tell me that lard      makes the best crust. No argument there, but I'm not crazy      about using a highly saturated animal fat in my food. (Only      tropical oils and butter beat lard when it comes to the      saturated fat percentage.) We've read about how evil      saturated fat is raising the bad LDL cholesterol in our      blood. Butter is a saturated fat that makes a tough crust.      So we'll substitute margarine, right? That depends.    </p>    <p>      The Center for Science in the Public Interest is trying to      confuse us by reporting that trans fatty acids (margarine)      are no better than butter. Margarine contains large amounts      of chemically altered (partially hydrogenated) vegetable      oils. Adding hydrogen atoms to liquid oils to make them      more solid creates trans fatty acids. Altering the fat      causes it to act like it's saturated fat in the      bloodstream, increasing our risk of heart disease.    </p>    <p>      So now what; should we fling pies at each other like "The      Three Stooges"? While that may be a healthy (but messy)      solution, it's not likely that we'll overdose on trans      fatty acids because we make an occasional pie. (Just as      long as we don't eat the entire pie ourselves.) I like to      use a little butter in the crust for flavor, and the rest      of the fat is margarine. If you don't mind using animal      fat, use lard. Life is for living, pies are for pleasure.      Enjoy.    </p>
