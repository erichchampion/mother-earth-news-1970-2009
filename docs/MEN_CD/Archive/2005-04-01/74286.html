                    		<h5 id="byline">     By Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      The trouble with crows is that they are so smart. Captive      crows have proven capable of learning to mimic the human      voice, match symbols with numbers and solve simple puzzles.      As New York clergyman Henry Ward Beecher declared more than      a century ago, “If men had wings and bore black      feathers, few of them would be clever enough to be      crows.”    </p>    <p>      Wild crows, on the other hand, sabotage gardens by      collecting seeds, pecking into tomatoes or melons, or      harvesting fruits a day or two ahead of humans. And      crows’ winter roosting behavior is a budget-busting      problem for many towns and cities, where thousands of crows      often roost together to keep one another warm.    </p>    <p>      American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) are talkative,      territorial and devoted to their families. And although      they can be garden pests, they do have their positive side.      Crows eat lots of insects, help clean up roadside carrion,      and their domestic lives exemplify an enviable level of      cooperation. Males and females work together to build      nests, incubate eggs and feed their young, all the while      participating in crow community life. Extended families      often share summer territory, and when a good food supply      is found, a sentinel crow often watches from a high tree      while its relatives settle in for a feast    </p>    <p>      What can you do when the site of that feast is your garden?      The old standby, the scarecrow, certainly has merit, but      crows will quickly become accustomed to a scarecrow that      never changes. For best results, construct a scarecrow with      a post up its back so it can easily be moved from one spot      to another. Every week or so, give your scarecrow a flashy      makeover by attaching dangling metal pie tins, compact      disks or other shiny, reflective objects to its arms or      hat. Movement makes sharp-eyed crows nervous, so giving      your scarecrow a helium-filled Mylar party balloon is a      good idea, too    </p>    <p>      Crows hear well, so the The Fund for Animals Wildlife      Rehabilitation Center suggests adding sound to your      crow-control arsenal in the form of a portable radio. You      don’t need to keep it on at night - crows stay      in their roosts after dark - but during the daytime      be sure to periodically change the station. Crows will      notice a difference between smooth jazz and contemporary      country; although no studies have been done on their      listening preferences, it’s reasonable to expect that      talk radio would put them on edge    </p>    <p>      Crows also are skittish around owl effigies and balloons      designed to scare them, though again it’s best to      plan a bit of movement into the scene. You can use bird      flash tape made of reflective Mylar as a tail for a bobbing      balloon, or mount an owl effigy atop a post that includes      whirligig blades that spin in the wind. Many bird-scare      devices truly look nightmarish, so you may need to strike a      balance between their deterrence value and how much terror      you can tolerate in your garden    </p>    <p>      Where crow pressure is modest, you may get good protection      with reflective tape alone, which can be tied to posts,      tomato cages or plant supports. In a small garden, try      tying string or fishing line, spaced several feet apart,      between tall posts installed along your garden’s      edge, so they form a wide overhead grid. Wildlife      biologists are not certain exactly how such strings work,      but they theorize that when crows hit the lines they decide      that the site is unsafe for feeding. If crow damage is      limited to the birds pecking into ripening ears of corn,      placing paper cups or paper bags over the ears after the      silk turns brown often gives good protection. When pilfered      seedlings are the main problem, protecting seedling beds      with any type of barrier - from bird netting to an      old upside-down shopping cart - may do the trick    </p>    <p>      In dire situations, you may need to use bird netting to      declare large sections of your garden off limits. If they      are hungry enough, crows will feed through netting that is      draped directly over plants, but they can’t penetrate      through to fruits and vegetables secured beneath a tent of      bird netting    </p>    <p>      An energetic dog also will do the trick. In Barnardstown,      Mass., organic grower Elaine Morley solved a serious crow      problem by training Tasha, her black lab/border collie mix,      to chase any crow that dared to enter her garden    </p>    <p>      With all of these crow-control measures, remember that      early intervention is key. Once crows find a patch of      watermelons, they will return each morning to peck on the      rind a few times. All too often, the crows will throw an      early morning watermelon party on the day when a melon is      perfectly ripe.    </p>    <p>      And don’t make the mistake of trusting crows that are      obviously watching your garden, but not actively causing      damage. Proving that patience and wisdom go hand-in-hand,      crows don’t mind waiting for weeks until grapes or      pumpkins are perfect for picking. When you know crows are      watching your garden, the most important thing you can do      is to watch them back and use your intelligence to counter      one of Mother Nature’s smartest animals.    </p>    <p>      <br />      Contributing editor Barbara Pleasant shares her home in the      mountains of western North Carolina with three pairs of      crows. Her Web site is www.barbara<br />      pleasant.com    </p>    <h3>      When Crows Come to Town    </h3>        <p>      Cities and towns from Kansas to New York share a serious      problem every winter. Murders (the name for a group of      crows) - ranging from 1,000 to 75,000 individual      crows - establish winter roosts in street-side trees,      making a great ruckus and drenching cars and sidewalks with      their droppings. Beyond being messy and odoriferous, the      massive amount of droppings may pose a public health      hazard.    </p>    <p>      But getting roosting crows to disperse is far from simple.      Trained wildlife-control professionals typically use a      combination of harassment techniques including pyrotechnics      (exploding shells and firecrackers) and playing tapes of      crow death cries and hawk screams at ear-splitting levels.      To be effective, crow hazing campaigns must be conducted      several days in a row in early evening or just before dawn,      the times when crows are naturally mobile. But the plans      can backfire when crows forced to abandon a roost next to      the county courthouse find a new roost in trees around a      church or school.<br />      To avoid such failures, some towns spend thousands of      dollars on crow-control specialists. One such firm, Bird      Control International, uses a combination of trained hawks      and falcons, broadcast distress calls, high-powered      spotlights and pyrotechnics to move roosting crows to      places where they can better wait out the winter    </p>    <h3>      <em>Eat no Crow</em></h3>          <p>      As the saying goes, “eating crow” means      enduring a humiliating experience. The story behind the      phrase dates back to the War of 1812, when an American      hunter shot a crow behind British lines. To disgrace the      hunter, a British officer made the hunter eat some of the      crow. Later, the tables turned when the hunter regained his      musket and forced the Brit to finish off the bird. Crow      tastes terrible, largely due to the birds’ eclectic      diets. Crows eat more than 600 different foods, and      one-third of their diet consists of animal matter. To      carnivorous crows, rotting possum carcasses are as      delectable as grasshoppers, spiders, frogs or the corn seed      you plant in your garden    </p>    <h3>      Is it a Raven or a Crow?    </h3>        <p>      Compared to the clear “caw caw” of a crow,      ravens have croakier voices, and they tend to be larger      birds, with bodies up to 26 inches long compared to      crows’ average length of 17 to 21 inches. All three      species of raven native to North America can be      distinguished from crows by their broad, wedge-shaped tails      (as opposed to fan-shaped) and their flight patterns. Crows      may glide from one nearby tree to another, but while in      open flight, they always flap their wings. Ravens, in      comparison, soar and glide like hawks. Ravens also live      twice as long as crows, often surviving for up to 15 years      in the wild    </p>    <h3>      Resources    </h3>    <p>      If you can’t find reflective tape, bird netting or      other crow-scaring equipment through a local source, the      following mail-order companies sell many interesting      devices - from fake owls that hoot and swivel their      heads to spooky-looking, motion-activated sprinklers.    </p>  <p>      <em>Biocontrol Network</em><br />      (800) 441-2847<br />    <a href="http://www.biconet.com" target="_blank">www.biconet.com    </a></p>    <p>      <em>Gempler’s</em><br />      (800) 382-8473<br />    <a href="http://www.gemplers.com" target="_blank">www.gemplers.com</a>    </p>    <p>      <em>Margo Supplies (Canada)</em><br />      (403) 652-1932<br />    <a href="http://www.margosupplies.com" target="_blank">www.margosupplies.com    </a></p>    <p>      <em>Peaceful Valley Farm Supply</em><br />      (888) 784-1722<br />    <a href="http://www.groworganic.com" target="_blank">www.groworganic.com</a>    </p>    <p>      <em>To read crow-scaring tips from Mother’s Archive,      go to www.MotherEarthNews.com and search for      “crows.”</em>    </p>
