        Two dangerous spiders: The brown recluse (top most) prefers to lurk in the seldom- disturbed areas of homes, such as basements, closet corners and behind furniture. The female black widow (above) is perhaps the most harmful spider to humans. It prefers outdoor habitat under many kinds of debris, but also may come indoors.
