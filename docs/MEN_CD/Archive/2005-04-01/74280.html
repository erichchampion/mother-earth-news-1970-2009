                    <h3>      Grow a Wild Flower Meadow    </h3>    <p>      <strong><em>Enjoy lots of color, less mowing and more      wildlife in your back yard</em></strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      When you care for a piece of land, you want to do the right      thing by it. Whether your land is measured in square feet      or acres, one very right option is to deck it out with      wildflowers - low-maintenance bloomers that look      beautiful, support wildlife and are willing to accept what      your site and soil have to offer.    </p>    <p>      I’ve been tinkering with wildflowers for years,      enjoying my successes and learning from my failures. These      days, my goal is to establish truly sustainable plantings      composed of native perennials - beautiful plant      communities that can be maintained with once-a-year mowing.      There are many ways to plant a wildflower meadow, and each      is infinitely more interesting than mowing a lawn or bush      hogging a field. And beyond being beautiful, wildflowers      have the power to nourish the land.    </p>    <p>      “When you push a lawn back to habitat, you will      quickly see the animals return,” says Mark Simmons,      an ecologist at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.      “All kinds of creatures will colonize quickly,      because you’re providing food and habitat for birds,      animals and insects.”    </p>    <p>      To keep things simple, we’ll look at two likely      starting places for wildflower meadows - an area of      lawn in a typical home landscape and a section of open      field about a half acre in size From Lawn to Wildflowers.    </p>        <p>      The site I’m working now was a slightly weedy zoysia      lawn two years ago. I think it needs another year of work      before it’s ready to support native perennials, which      tend to be slow-growing plants that compete poorly with      weeds that thrive in disturbed lawn or garden soils.      Meanwhile, the plot is supporting a succession of annual      wildflowers, few of which are native species. In a      transition site, this is not a bad thing. Last fall,      migrating monarchs paused to sip nectar from the sulphur      cosmos I planted after I stripped off the sod, tilled the      soil and dug in 3 inches of rotted horse manure. I dug and      amended the site again in winter, then planted a mixture of      colorful species adapted to my area. In late spring,      honeybees busily worked the poppies, and a few weeks later,      goldfinches showed up to dine on ripe bachelor button seeds    </p>    <p>      These and other non-native, annual wildflowers (the same      category used for most highway plantings) provide lots of      color, and many of them reseed pretty well, even when the      soil is dug, amended and replanted with additional species.      Many “meadow in a can” labels advise against      cultivating the soil before planting because it can      increase weed problems, but I have found that sites      switched from lawn to wildflowers benefit from the same      methods used to cultivate a garden: amending the soil with      organic matter to improve its texture and drainage, and at      least two seasons of dedicated weeding to deplete the      soil’s “weed seed bank.” Later on, when I      make the switch to perennials, the annuals will gradually      disappear as the perennials take over    </p>    <p>      With perennial wildflowers, it’s wise to stick      exclusively with natives, which will become the permanent      anchor plants in your wildflower meadow and will slowly      elbow out more short-lived annuals.    </p>    <p>      “Native plants are best for native critters, but      beyond that is the fact that native plants are adapted to      the local soil and environmental conditions. So, they      don’t need additional water and fertilizer,”      says Donna VanBuecken, executive director of Wild Ones      (www.for-wild.org), a national organization that promotes      landscaping practices that preserve or restore native plant      communities. “If your objective is to heal the Earth,      then the goal is to build a biodiversified native community      that includes plants, insects, butterflies and other      wildlife.”    </p>    <p>      You can buy perennial plants from a native plant nursery or      grow your own, which is a fun project in itself. Two      methods work especially well: sowing seeds in a specially      prepared nursery bed in the fall, and rooting stem-tip      cuttings taken from established plants in the spring. A      third option is to adopt plants rescued from places being      cleared for new construction - a tactic VanBuecken      uses. Organized plant rescues also are conducted by      numerous native plant societies, which now exist in almost      every state. If you’re rescuing on your own, always      get permission from the landowner first, and dig plants in      the morning so you can spend the afternoon transplanting      them into the ground    </p>    <p>      In addition to blooming wildflowers, a sustainable      perennial meadow should also include grasses. The best ones      are native warm-season bunch grasses or sedges that      stabilize the site and make great neighbors for perennial      wildflowers. “There seems to be a symbiotic      relationship between grasses and flowers,” says Alan      Wade, who has worked with Midwestern native plants at      Minnesota-based Prairie Moon Nursery for 22 years.      “Grasses alone can fail after 10 years or so, and      flowers by themselves usually have a lot of weeds.”      In terms of planning, it’s best to shoot for an equal      mix of grasses and flowers, allowing some leeway for      preferences your site may reveal to you over time    </p>    <p>      I wait until I begin plugging in perennials to establish      grasses. With few exceptions, seeds of warm-season bunch      grasses, such as little bluestem, germinate best when      planted directly into the soil in spring. Spring also is an      excellent season to transplant egg-sized plugs of grass cut      from wild stands with a sharp knife. Once you know what to      look for finding donor swaths of native grasses is pretty      easy    </p>    <p>      After the little perennials and grasses are in place comes      a season of hand weeding. By this time, you’ll start      recognizing both the weeds in the site and the plants you      want to grow. To minimize disturbance to young wildflowers      and grasses, pull weeds when the soil is wet, and get them      while they’re small.    </p>    <p>      From this point on, you can maintain your little meadow by      cutting it down once a year with a weed trimmer, or you can      use loppers to nip out individual plants as they fail and      stockpile the debris. I like to clean out the debris,      because neatness counts in my meadow. As space opens up in      winter, chop through the pile of withered plants and return      them to the site as mulch. Then wait until early spring to      mow so the plot can provide shelter and habitat for birds      and other small critters through the winter.    </p>    <h3>      Tips from the Pros    </h3>    <p>      • “Create several little meadows as opposed to      one big one. “Most yards are filled with soil brought      in from different places, so it’s possible that      plants that do poorly in one area may thrive in another.      Later on, when the plants seed out, they will relocate      where they want to grow.” - Donna VanBuecken,      Wild Ones    </p>    <p>      • “While sowing seed, cover a few places with      pieces of carpet or tarp. Later on, you can use these      unsown places as weed indicators. Plants that match those      in the weed indicator plots are weeds, not the wildflowers      you sowed.”    </p>    <p>      <br />      <em>- Alan Wade, Prairie Moon Nursery</em>    </p>        <p>      • “Dominant species will change over the years.      Celebrate the changes and the diversity, but don’t be      afraid to edit as needed.”    </p>    <p>      <br />      <em>- Cheryl Lowe, New England Wild Flower      Society</em>    </p>    <p>      <br />      • “Become sensitive to your site. Watch it for a      year, mow it from time to time, and see what happens. You      may be pleasantly surprised.”    </p>    <p>      <br />      <em>- Mark Simmons, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower      Center</em>    </p>    <h3>      Restoring a Field    </h3>    <p>      In some fortunate situations, the land already hosts a good      basic population of meadow plants - like a thin stand      of native bunch grasses and wildflowers - so the main      task is hoeing out weeds and replacing them with a      diversified guild of native plants. Keith Bowers, president      and founder of Biohabitats, a Maryland-based firm that      restores dry and wetland landscapes across the country,      tells of one such site where his team plugged in a few      plants and added bird feeders and perches, so that birds      would bring in seeds from adjoining land with good stands      of desirable wildflowers.    </p>    <p>      I was not so lucky when I wanted to create a wildflower      meadow in an abandoned field. My land was covered with tall      fescue, a grass too big and rowdy to share quarters with      wildflowers. Not wanting to use herbicides, I hitched the      disc onto the tractor and shredded the stuff to bits. Then      I sowed corn poppies, envisioning a beautiful field of      flowers the following spring. It didn’t work. The      soil was too poor to support the flowers, and the fescue      came back with a vengeance.    </p>    <p>      Not willing to give up, the next fall I planted a      soil-building cover crop, crimson clover, mixed with      bachelor button seeds. The planting made a great show in      spring, but I was still seeing quite a bit of fescue. After      a few more drags of the disc, I sowed a smother crop of      sulphur cosmos mixed with nitrogen-fixing crowder peas. The      land liked this regimen so well that I repeated it for      another year. By then, the fescue was gone, and I was able      to begin planting native wildflowers    </p>    <p>      I used the “kitchen-sink” approach, throwing in      seeds of everything I thought might work. I also dug in      asters, goldenrods, broomsedge and other natives I found      elsewhere on my property and plunked them down in the      meadow. I had to sell the place while the meadow was still      a work in progress, but after three years of interesting      effort, it was coming along quite nicely    </p>    <p>      Fall-sown cover crops rarely winterkill in Zone 7 (average      minimum winter temperatures between zero and 10 degrees),      but in climates where they do, they offer an excellent way      to prepare a field for wildflowers. Oats work great for      this purpose, and the dead plants can be left in place as a      weed-suppressing mulch. If the site needs more work to      control invasive species, plant it with buckwheat in      summer. When preparing space for a restored prairie (the      Midwest’s version of a native wildflower meadow),      Wade often spends two years on site preparation before      sowing seed or plugging in plants. “Weed competition      is the main reason new meadows fail,” he says    </p>    <p>      The best times to plant seed are spring and fall, and each      season has advantages. Wildflower seeds often do best when      seeded in the fall, while warm-season grasses germinate      best when sown in spring. On the other hand, weed      competition is greater in spring, less in fall. The choice      is yours    </p>    <p>      In both seasons, Bowers says good seeding technique is      important. “Except for some cool-season grasses, the      seeds don’t germinate well unless they are buried      beneath a quarter inch of soil.” You can press the      seeds in place with a roller, or do it using human power by      walking over the seeded area while tamping around with the      backside of a shovel    </p>    <p>      Whether you use seeds or plants (marked with sticks or      plant labels), the main task the first season after      planting is mowing. Mow the infant meadow every three weeks      or so at a height of 4 to 8 inches. You can use your lawn      mower if the blade can be set as high as 4 inches, or you      can use a string trimmer. Evenness of cut is not as      important as regularly topping back the plants, which will      include those you planted as well as numerous weeds. Mowing      keeps the weeds from setting seeds, encourages the flowers      and grasses to stay low, developing roots and crowns, and      keeps enough light coming through to coax slow-sprouting      seeds to life. Limit weeding to battles with superweeds      such as bindweed or Canada thistle, which should be sliced      off at ground level with a sharp knife.on’t pull      them, which will disturb little seedlings while dragging      more weed seeds to the surface.    </p>    <p>      In the second year, management of a wildflower meadow      involves weeding, weeding and then more weeding. You      won’t disturb the soil if you use a pair of pruning      shears to cut weeds off at ground level. Switch to a knife      to cut around the base of big, woody weeds. For tap-rooted      weeds such as dandelion or dock, use a fishtail weeder,      also called a dandelion fork.    </p>    <h3>      Maintenance Mowing    </h3>    <p>      In its third season, weeding a wildflower meadow of any      size becomes much more casual, and you won’t need to      mow until fall. “A regular lawn mower won’t      work. You’ll need a weed trimmer with a blade      attachment,” Wade says. Or, you can go low-tech with      a swing blade or machete. Be prepared to encounter stems as      much as an inch in diameter and chop down everything to      about 4 inches. The main reason to mow a young meadow in      the fall is to disperse seed over a wide area, which is an      easy way to support the reseeding process naturally. After      four or five years, you can switch to spring mowing, which      preserves wildlife habitat through winter and allows you to      enjoy the show as wind riffles through dried grass, birds      snap up seeds and snow turns plant skeletons into white      sculptures    </p>    <p>      It is also good to burn a mature meadow in early spring,      though other considerations - such as safety and air      quality - make mowing more practical for most people.      As for the debris that accumulates when you mow, you can      gather it up or let it lay. Tallgrass prairies or wetland      meadows may produce so much debris that it will smother      little plants, but meadows composed of low-growing species      don’t usually need to be raked after mowing    </p>    <p>      By this time, your meadow may make suggestions for      refinement. “Dominant species will change over the      years. Celebrate the changes and the diversity, but      don’t be afraid to edit as needed” says Cheryl      Lowe, horticulture director at the New England Wild Flower      Society’s Garden in the Woods in Framingham, Mass.      Maybe you’ll want to increase populations of some      plants (hint: root some stem-tip cuttings), or get rid of      some you don’t like. “Once you put a meadow in,      the process doesn’t end,” Bowers says.      “That’s where it begins.” You consider      what you have, think about where you want to go, and little      by little, you get there. Look around you. Nature works      this way all the time.    </p>    <h3>      Learn from Your Local Landscapes    </h3>        <p>      What plants should you put in your wildflower meadow?      Instead of using the pictures on a package of wildflower      seeds as your vision, get familiar with natural wildflower      meadows in your area. Keith Bowers of Biohabitats calls      these “reference ecosystems,” and he thinks      they offer the best possible lessons in learning to read      your land and its latent possibilities. Alan Wade of      Prairie Moon Nursery agrees completely. “Look for      local, natural landscaping groups and get advice from other      people in your area. Contact the Nature Conservancy to find      out about local natural areas you can visit,” Wade      advises. Take along a good wildflower field guide, such as      those published by Knopf for the National Audubon Society.      The more wildflower meadows you actually experience, the      more inspired you will be to proceed thoughtfully with your      own.    </p>    <h3>      Wildflower Resources    </h3>        <p>      You can find local sources of native wildflowers and      grasses through local native plant societies, or through      the supplier database maintained by the Lady Bird Johnson      Wildflower Center. Go to the Web site at      www.wildflower.org, click “Explore Plants,”      then “Suppliers Directory.” From there, you can      search by state, region or by site criteria. Suppliers      range from large companies to people who sell seeds      collected from their own land. A close match between the      source of seeds or plants and their permanent home is      ideal, and it’s always best to plant seed soon after      it has been harvested. Another place to check is your local      office of the U.S.epartment of Agriculture’s Natural      Resources Conservation Service (NRCS; there is an office in      every county). Sometimes local organizations work with NRCS      to make free wildflower seeds available to help citizens do      their part to improve various types of wildlife habitats    </p>    <p>      To learn more about wildflowers and grasses native to your      area, the following regional companies (and many more)      maintain Web sites that feature extensive information about      native wildflowers and grasses (most with great photos).    </p>    <p>      <em>Ernst Conservation Seeds, Meadville, Pa.; (800)      873-3321; <a href="http://www.ernstseed.com" target="_blank">www.ernstseed.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Native American Seed, Junction, Texas; (800) 728-4043;      <a href="http://www.seedsource.com" target="_blank">www.seedsource.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Plants of the Southwest, Santa Fe, N.M.; (800)      788-7333; <a href="http://www.plantsofthesouthwest.com" target="_blank">www.plantsofthesouthwest.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Plants of the Wild, Tekoa, Wash.; (509) 284-2848;      <a href="http://www.plantsofthewild.com" target="_blank">www.plantsofthewild.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Prairie Moon Nursery, Winona, Minn.; (866) 417-8156;      <a href="http://www.prairiemoon.com" target="_blank">www.prairiemoon.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Shooting Star Nursery, Frankfort, Ky.; (502) 867-7979;      <a href="http://www.shootingstarnursery.com" target="_blank">www.shootingstarnursery.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Western Native Seed, Coaldale, Colo.; (719) 942-3935;      <a href="http://www.westernnativeseed.com" target="_blank">www.westernnativeseed.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Wildflower Farm, Coldwater, Ontario; (866) 476-9453;      <a href="http://www.wildflowerfarm.com" target="_blank">www.wildflowerfarm.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Wildseed Farms, Fredericksburg, Texas; (800) 848-0078;      <a href="http://www.wildseedfarms.com" target="_blank">www.wildseedfarms.com</a></em>    </p>
