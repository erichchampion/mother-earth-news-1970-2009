        When selecting a variety of garlic to grow for cooking scapes(flowering garlic stems), it's best to stick to those proven to dowell in your particular area. The U.S. Department of Agriculturehas identified only 10 major garlic cultivars based on geneticanalysis of the 400 garlics in its collection, so the field is morenarrow than it may seem from reading seed catalogs. The scapes of'Chesnok' and 'Purple Italian Easy Peel' garlic are consideredexcellent for cooking. Check with your local agricultural Extensionoffice to see if these varieties do well in your area.
