    <p>
                          <p>      I keep having this wonderful dream in which I've been      transported to Italy, roaming the countryside and eating to      my heart's content. Then I awake to a reality breakfast of      oatmeal and tea. I remember when my husband and I really      were transported to Florence, Rome, and beyond to eat,      sight-see, and eat once again. Not only were the      surroundings beautiful but the food was the best I've ever      tasted. I loved the homemade mozzarella balls in our      salads, handmade pasta, a zillion flavors of gelato, and      eggplant sandwiches. It seemed that every espresso stand or      fast food counter had eggplant sandwiches-Italy's      answer to our bagels. It usually consisted of two slices of      sauteed eggplant on some delicious Italian bread, sometimes      with a slice of mozzarella or tomato. I loved this      vegetarian snack so, needless to say, I ate quite a few.      After the eggplant sandwiches and gelato sampling, I had      little room left for a two or three course dinner. I was      forced to quit after the pasta course while my husband      moved on to the veal.    </p>        <p>      Americans are usually too busy for several courses, so when      it comes to Italian food, it's either pasta or meat. In      Italy, the meat dish was almost secondary in comparison to      the rest of the meal. The U.S.D.A. "Food Pyramid" and the      "Mediterranean Diet" illustrate that we should go easy on      the meat and dairy and emphasize instead grains, beans,      fruit, and vegetables. Many of us grew up believing that      Italian food should be smothered with cheese and sauce when      in fact, Italian cooking varies depending on the region.      Italian cooking need be neither heavy nor labor intensive.      Don't worry, there's no need to throw out your favorite      lasagna recipe; use less cheese and more vegetables.      "Mangia!"</p><p> Chicken with Tomatoes and Artichokes (serves 4)    </p>        <p>      Here's an easy chicken recipe that can be on the table in      30 minutes or prepared ahead and reheated. Serve over      pasta, orzo, or risotto (rice).</p><p> 2 teaspoons olive oil<br />      4 to 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 3 ounces      each<br />      1 medium onion, halved and sliced<br />      4 large cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 teaspoon grated orange rind<br />      1 eight-ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, defrosted (I      used Bird's eye)<br />      1 fourteen-and-a-half or fifteen ounce can plum tomatoes,      drained and chopped. liquid saved<br />      1/4 cup each: chicken broth, tomato liquid, fresh squeezed      orange juice<br />      2 teaspoons fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)<br />      1/4 teaspoon salt dash cayenne pepper and freshly ground      pepper<br />      12 ounces spaghettini<br />      1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br />      1 cup chopped Italian parsley salt and pepper to taste</p><p> In a      large skillet, heat the oil on the medium- high heat. Saute      the chicken breasts for about three minutes per side until      browned, ducing heat if they start to bum. Stir in the      onions and garlic; saute until wilted. Add the rest of the      ingredients except the spaghettini cover, and reduce heat.      Simmer for about minutes until the chicken is done in the      center. Meanwhile, boil the water for the pasta Boil the      pasta for about 4 minutes until just tender (al dente).      Drain thoroughly and toss in a large bowl with the oil,      parsley, and sea sonings. Put pasta onto plates, then spoon      the chicken and sauce over the top.</p><p> *Spaghettini: thinner      than spaghetti but not as thin as angel hair or capellini</p>			<h3>Commit (Dessert)</h3>    <p>You can buy cannoli shells but if you're not pressed    for time, these easy shells are much lower in fat. Not fried    like the readymade, these are more of a rolled cookie.</p><p>    Filling.</p><p> 1 fifteen-ounce container low fat or skim ricotta    cheese<br />    1/4 cup sugar<br />    1 tablespoon maple syrup<br />    1 teaspoon grated lemon rind<br />    1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br />    1/2 cup minichocolate chips<br />    optional: 1/2 cup unsalted pistachios, shelled</p><p> Chop the    pistachios in the food processor or by hand so the pieces    aren't too large. Pour into a small bowl. Using a food    processor or mixer, beat together until smooth everything    except the chocolate chips and nuts. Stir in the chocolate    chips. Shortly before serving, spoon the filling into the    shells and dip the ends of the shells into the nuts.</p>		<h3>Homemade Cannoli Shells</h3>		<p> 2 tablespoons    unsalted butter, melted and cooled cup sugar<br />    2 egg whites<br />    1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />    1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br />    1/3 cup unbleached white flour</p><p> Preheat oven to 375°F. In    a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar. Add the egg whites    and extracts; beat until smooth and slightly foamy. Spoon the    flour into the measuring cup and level with a knife. Stir    into the egg mixture until the lumps are gone. Lay a broom on    your kitchen table and clean the handle: you'll use it for    shaping the shells. Oil generously two nonstick cookie    sheets. Depending on the size of your cookie sheets, make up    to four pancakes, 1 tablespoon dough each, on one of the    cookie sheets. Using a spoon, spread out the dough into a 3    1/2" to 4" thin circle. Make sure the edges aren't too thin    or they'll crumble later. Bake for about seven minutes until    the edges are golden brown and the center firm. Using a    pancake turner, remove the shells from the cookie sheet as    quickly as possible. Wrap each one around the broom handle    with the edges overlapping underneath the handle. Don't wrap    them too tightly or they won't come off. Cool before sliding    off the handle. Repeat using the other greased cookie sheet.</p>		<h3>Green and White Lasagna</h3>		<p>Making lasagna has    never been easy for me, even with my Italian stepmother's    terrific recipe; either it's too dry or too soupy. Although    this recipe uses more dairy than I would like, it comes out    deliciously perfect every time. When fresh basil isn't    available, I use a tablespoon of pesto from my freezer and    add it to the sauce.</p>		<h3>Basil Cream Sauce:</h3>		<p> 3    tablespoons unsalted butter<br />    3 tablespoons unbleached white flour<br />    1 large clove garlic minced<br />    1/4 teaspoon salt<br />    1/4 teaspoon each: white pepper, nut cayenne pepper<br />    3 cups lowfat or skim milk (1 prefer 1% milk)<br />    1/4 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan cheese<br />    1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, snipped with a scissors into    strips<br />    14 lasagna noodles</p><p> Filling:</p><p> 2 ten-ounce packages frozen    chopped spinach, defrosted<br />    1 egg, beaten<br />    1/4 teaspoon salt<br />    1 fifteen-ounce container lowfat ricotta cheese<br />    1 cup provolone or mozzarella cheese, grated (I used smoked    mozzarella for more flavor)<br />    1/4 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan cheese*</p>		<h3>Topping:</h3>		<p> 1 cup Provolone or Mozzarella    cheese, grated</p><p> Sauce: In a medium sauce pan, melt the butter    and whisk in the flour, garlic, and spices. Keep whisking on    medium heat for about one minute to cook the flour. Stir in    the milk and whisk until smooth. Keel stirring occasionally    until the sauce has thickened, at least 10 minutes. Remove    from heat and stir in the cheese and basil. Lay a piece of    plastic wrap over the top of the sauce and set aside.</p><p>    Preliminaries: Preheat oven to 375°F. Boil water in a    large soup pot; add the lasagna noodles. Boil until tender;    about 10 minutes. Drain and lay the pasta out on a    non-terrycloth dishtowel.</p><p> Place the spinach in a colander and    press out the water. In a large bowl, whisk together the    ricotta and egg; stir in the cheeses and spinach.</p><p> Assembly:    Have ready a 9"x13" baking pan. Pour the sauce into a glass    measuring cup. Spread 1 cup of sauce in the bottom of the    pan. Put down 4 noodles lengthwise, overlapping the edges if    necessary. Spread one-third of the filling over the noodles.    Repeat the order two more times. Sprinkle the cheese on top.    Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes until the top is lightly    browned and the lasagna is bubbly. Don't overcook. Cool for    15 minutes before slicing. Cut into squares and serve.</p><p> *I use    Pecorino Romano cheese for all my Italian cooking. It has a    stronger flavor than Parmesan so less cheese is needed.</p>		<h3>Tomato and Mozzarellla Salad (serves 4)</h3>		<p> This    salad is best when the tomatoes are fresh from the garden but    I make it occasionally during the winter using fresh Italian    plum tomatoes which are usually available all year round.</p><p> 4    fresh or smoked mozzarella balls, 1 to 2 inches in    diameter<br />    4 to 5 ripe plum tomatoes about 16 large, fresh basil    leaves<br />    1 head Boston leaf lettuce or greens of your choice</p><p> Dressing:</p><p>    1/4 cup good quality extra-virgin olive oil<br />    2 tablespoons Balsamic vinegar<br />    1 large clove garlic, minced<br />    pinch sugar<br />    salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</p><p> Slice the cheese and    tomatoes into quarter-inch slices. Wash and dry the whole    lettuce leaves. Whisk together the dressing in a glass    measuring cup. Arrange the lettuce leaves in a single layer    on a platter or individual plates. Alternate the cheese,    tomato, and basil slices on the platter. Drizzle the dressing    over the top just before serving. The salad can be covered    with plastic wrap and refrigerated for an hour or so without    the dressing.</p>		<h3>Eggplant Sandwiches</h3>		<p> 1 medium    eggplant<br />    extra-virgin olive oil<br />    optional: 2 large cloves garlic, minced<br />    1 whole-grain baguette or a hard-crusted Italian bread, cut    into thick slices<br />    1 medium tomato, sliced<br />    fresh lettuce, spinach, or arugula leaves Other ideas: pesto    sauce, roasted red pepper provolone, mozzarella, or goat    cheese</p><p> Slice the eggplant into half-inch circles and place in    a colander. Generously salt the slices and place the colander    in the sink for thirty minutes. Turn on the oven broiler and    line a cookie sheet with toil. Rinse the slices in cold water    and pat dry with paper towels. Place the slices on the cookie    sheet and brush with olive oil and garlic. Broil for about 3    to 4 minutes per side about six inches from the flame until    they're lightly browned. The slices will continue to soften    as they cool. Pile the eggplant into a plastic container or    wrap in foil until needed. I like to make the sandwiches    while the eggplant is still warm. Keep in the refrigerator    for up to a week. Lightly toast or warm the bread and    assemble the sandwiches.</p>
