        <p>Cultivated blueberries are descended from native species, but in the northern plains the “blueberry” of choice is the saskatoon (<i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i>), or Juneberry. The fine-flavored ‘Thiessen’ variety can produce more than 10 pounds of fruit per bush; most selections will bear 6 to 7 pounds at maturity. But like many native plants, saskatoons are picky about site, preferring soil high in organic matter on a gentle northeastern slope. On the plus side, saskatoons aren’t picky about pH (anything near neutral will do), and the fruits contain more vitamin C than other blueberries.</p><p>Two more natives - elderberries and aronia (black chokecherry) - are too tart for snacks, but they’re great for making nutrient-rich juice or prize-winning wines. Aronia wines have won international competitions. Elderberries produce a rich, dark red wine that’s thought to carry the restorative health benefits of make-you-pucker elderberry juice. (Learn more about <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/home-brewing-beer-wine-cider-soda.aspx#Making_Wine" target="_blank">wine making</a>.)</p><p>If these berries won’t fill your yard, there are still more tart berries to explore, for example cranberries (if you have a moist, acidic site) and lingonberries, a good edible ornamental ground cover for partial shade in cold climates. Lingonberries’ need for acidic soil restricts their spread, but some non-native berries run a high risk of becoming out-of-control. Birds eat the berries and drop the seeds everywhere. For this reason, pump up your yard with trusted and/or native fruits before trying goumi (<i>Elaeagnus multiflora</i>), honeyberry (<i>Lonicera caerulea</i>), and other recent imports with eerily close genetic ties to known invasive species.</p><p></p><hr /><h2>More Information on Less Common Native Berries</h2><p>Find less common native berry seeds and plants with our <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Find-Seeds-Plants.aspx" target="_blank">Seed and Plant Finder</a>.</p><p>To learn how to use blueberries in your home landscape, check out the new book <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=4151" target="_blank">Landscaping with Fruit</a> by Lee Reich (Tower, 2009).</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Real-Food/Growing-Berries.aspx" target="_blank">Growing Strawberries, Blueberries, Raspberries, Blackberries, Currants and Other Berries That Thrive Where You Live</a></li><li><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1998-02-01/Uncommon-Fruits.aspx" target="_blank">Uncommon Fruits</a></li></ul>
