    <p>
                    <p>      Heavy, meaty, high caloric main dishes gobble up more than      35  cents of the average American food dollar. I think      that's too much to spend, especially on meals that are      bigger and harder to digest than they ought to be.    </p>    <p>      For that reason, I've worked to develop lighter, less      expensive but still nutritious-preparations for the meals I      fix. And my favorite creations of all are soups made from      nothing taut fresh vegetables, clear water, and spices.      Such comestibles are filling, warming, healthful, and      inexpensive. Plus-if, like many MOTHER people, you grow      your own vegetables-these soups will cost you almost      nothing!    </p>    <p>      Please remember, of course, that the following recipes are      simply guidelines. Change them freely to suit your tastes      and/or the ingredients you have on hand. Your only      limitation in the gentle art of soupery is your      imagination.    </p>    <p>      Experiment, have fun, enjoy. Above all else, enjoy. Pour      yourself a glass of wine, tea, juice, or whatever turns you      on, and have at it!    </p>        <h3>      HOMESTEAD VEGETABLE SOUP    </h3>    <p>      1 sweet potato<br />      1 carrot<br />      1 turnip parsnip<br />      1 white potato<br />      1 onion<br />      1 tablespoon of butter<br />      2 tablespoons of rice<br />      2 quarts of cold water<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      1 sprig of parsley<br />      1 root of celery<br />      1 teaspoon of salt    </p>    <p>      Dice all the vegetables. Then melt the butter in a skillet,      add all the vegetables-except for the white potato-and fry      until the pieces are lightly browned. Dump the chunks into      a soup kettle and add the rice, water, herbs, and celery.      Boil the mixture 1-1/2 hours, add the white potato, and      continue the boil for another 15 minutes. Season to your      family's taste and serve.    </p>    <h3>      SPEEDY SPUD SOUP    </h3>    <p>      Potatoes (enough to fill a large pot) Water to cover 1      quart of milk Salt and pepper to taste 2 tablespoons of      flour 1 tablespoon of butter Peel the potatoes-make sure      they're sound!-and cut them into pieces small enough to be      eaten with a spoon. Rinse or soak the spuds well in cold      water, then cover with water and boil. Next, add the quart      of milk and season the broth to taste. When the 'taters are      cooked, fry 2 tablespoons of flour and 1 tablespoon of      butter in a pan, stir the combination until it turns brown,      and then blend the mixture into the potato stock. Serve      promptly. This soup may be seasoned with celery or parsley,      too, if you desire. To make it still more delectable, beat      up 1 or 2 eggs in a cup of cold milk, stir it into the      soup, and serve.    </p>    <h3>      RED BEAN SOUP    </h3>    <p>      2-1 /2 cups of red kidney beans<br />      1 celery stalk<br />      1 slice of onion<br />      1 carrot<br />      4 cups of water Salt, paprika, and pepper to taste      Croutons, optional Boil the beans, celery, onion, and      carrot in the water until they're nice and tender. (Toss in      a ham bone or some bacon, if you like, for the added      flavor.) Then, add your seasonings, strain, and serve with      croutons. Yield: 6 servings.    </p>    <h3>      CREAMED CELERY SOUP    </h3>    <p>      1 bunch of celery, cut into fine pieces<br />      1/2 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 slice of onion<br />      5 cups of water<br />      2 cups of your favorite white sauce    </p>    <p>      Combine the celery, salt, onion, and water in a saucepan.      Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the      celery is very tender. Strain and reserve two cups of the      mixture for stock. Next, force the celery through a sieve      into the stock. Fold in the hot white sauce. Stir the      thickened soup well and serve. Yield: 4 servings.    </p>    <h3>      GOOD 'N GARLICKY SOUP    </h3>    <p>      6 or 7 crushed garlic cloves<br />      6 tablespoons of oil<br />      6 pinch of red pepper<br />      6 slices of white bread, cubed<br />      6 cups of water<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      4 beaten eggs<br />      2 tablespoons of chopped parsley<br />      Grated raw carrot, optional    </p>    <p>      Saute the garlic in oil until it's lightly browned. Add the      pepper, then remove the seasoned cloves from the pan. Now,      cook the bread in the same pan until it, too, is brown.      Pour in the water, salt, and garlic. Cover and let the      collection simmer for 30 minutes. Then blend in the eggs      and cook another 5 minutes. Finally, garnish with the      parsley and carrot. Yield: 6 servings.    </p>    <h3>      GARDEN SOUP    </h3>    <p>      Here's a real good way to use up mushroom skins and ends.      Mix them with chopped onion, celery pieces and leaves,      sliced or diced carrots, and chopped parsley. Cover this      salad with cold water and simmer for about 35 minutes.      Strain the stock and season it with salt and pepper.    </p>    <h3>      LOVE APPLE (better known as tomato) SOUP    </h3>    <p>      1 quart of tomatoes<br />      1 quart of water<br />      1 teaspoon of soda<br />      1 quart of milk    </p>    <p>      Salt, butter, and pepper to taste Crackers Stew the      tomatoes in water until they're soft. Then drop in the      teaspoon of soda and allow the liquid to bubble. Supplement      this base with boiling milk, salt, butter, and pepper to      taste-plus a little rolled cracker then boil everything a      few minutes and serve.PEPPY TOMATO CONSOMME    </p>    <p>      2 tomatoes, sliced into cubes<br />      3 sliced green peppers<br />      1 small onion, diced<br />      2 quarts of boiling water<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      3 or 4 whole cloves    </p>    <p>      Combine the tomatoes, peppers, and onion in a kettle. Then      pour in the boiling water and add the salt and cloves. Keep      the mixture at a boil for 5 minutes, then reduce the flame,      cover the pot, and simmer for 2 hours. Strain the result,      and serve. Yield: 6 servings.    </p>    <h3>      CREAMY CORN SOUP    </h3>    <p>      1 cup of cooked corn<br />      1 cup of boiling water<br />      1 cup of milk<br />      1 slice of onion<br />      1 tablespoon of butter<br />      1 tablespoon of flour    </p>    <p>      Salt and pepper Chop the corn and mix with the water, milk,      and onion in the top of a double boiler. Let the solution      cook for 25 minutes. Then-when the vegetables are      soft-force them through a sieve, and bind the resulting      porridge with the butter and flour which have been cooked      together. Salt and pepper to taste. Yield: 6 servings.    </p>    <h3>      CURRIED CORPS' SOUP    </h3>    <p>      Season the above potage to taste with curry powder.    </p>    <h3>      CREAMED LETTUCE SOUP    </h3>    <p>      1 teaspoon of chopped onion<br />      2 tablespoons of butter<br />      2 heads of lettuce, chopped<br />      2 tablespoons of rice<br />      2 cups of white stock<br />      1/2 cup of hot cream    </p>    <p>      1 egg yolk, slightly beaten Salt, pepper, and a dash of      nutmeg Saute the onion in butter for a few minutes (DON'T      BROWN!). Put in the lettuce, rice, and stock, cover the      mixture, and cook it until the rice is tender. At that      point, fold in the hot cream, egg yolk, and desired      seasonings. (NOTE: Once you've added the egg yolk, don't      allow the soup to boil!) This recipe works best if you use      only the heart of the lettuce. Save the outer leaves for      salads or sandwiches.    </p>    <h3>      SOUP KITCHEN SECRETS    </h3>    <p>      Here are some of my personal potage practices. I'm happy to      share them with you!    </p>    <p>      A handful of spinach leaves, pounded and added to a soup      five minutes or so before serving will produce a fine green      color. Parsley or celery leaves work, too.    </p>    <p>      An excellent gumbo for a small family can be made from the      throwaway trimmings of steaks and roasts at the local      butcher shop.    </p>    <p>      To make your own curry powder, combine 1 ounce each of      pepper, ginger, and mustard 3 ounces of coriander seed and      turmeric 1 to 3 ounces of cayenne and 1 to 2 ounces of      cardamom, cumin seed, and cinnamon. Powder all the      ingredients, sift them together, and store the mix in a      tightly capped bottle. You can use it to season soups,      rice, gravy, and some stews.    </p>    <p>      Parsley or celery can be dried in a slow oven. In the case      of parsley, the stems can be picked out and the leaves      tightly bottled for later use. The dried celery stalks and      roots can be grated and also bottled. A small bunch of      fresh parsley, or 2 tablespoons of dry, are all you need      for 4 quarts of soup.    </p>    <p>      Rolled oatmeal is almost as nice as rice in soup.    </p>    <p>      To make noodles: Stir in all the flour that one egg and a      dash of salt will absorb. Roll out the dough as thinly as      possible and let it dry. Then roll it up again, slice the      dough into narrow strips, and drop them into boiling soup      about 15 minutes before you expect to serve them.    </p>    <p>      To prepare croutons: Drop cubes of stale bread into about 1      inch of fat. (See MOTHER NO. 3, "Free", for information on      getting old bread for nothing!) When they've browned,      remove the bits of bread and drain them on absorbent paper.      Float the croutons in soup just before you serve it. You      can also place thin slices of fresh bread well buttered and      cubed-in a baking par:, buttered side up. and bake them      briefly in the oven.    </p>
