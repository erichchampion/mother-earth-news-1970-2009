                    <p>      I don't know who said it first, but he or she was      absolutely right: The more things change, the more they      stay the same. Take today's "new" back to the land      movement, for instance. It isn't new at all. The whole      history of this country is founded on one back to the land      movement after another, dating from the growth of the first      towns established on this continent. In short, as long as      great numbers of people have flocked to our cities, a      lesser number of (possibly more intelligent) folks have      been trying to getaway from them.    </p>    <p>      Nor have the details of this constantly self renewing swap      changed in the slightest. Big farmers have always been      squeezed out of the country by even bigger ones (and the      lure of those "easy" dollars in town). And back to the      landers have always had a struggle getting enough money      together to buy their little dream place out in the sticks.      And they've always felt that most of the chunks of property      offered to them "out there" are too big, or too small, or      too expensive. And they've always worried about what life      would be like once they really made the break and left the      city behind. And they've always at least the ones dedicated      enough to roll up their sleeves and make a life for      themselves out in the country been damn glad in later years      that they made the switch. ,    </p>    <p>      You don't believe it? You don't think that the very same      problems you're now facing have been faced ten times ten      thousand times before? Then you haven't read the history of      this country as it was written by the people who've gone      before.    </p>    <p>      Here, for instance (thanks to Mrs. Joe E. Hanauer of Dixon,      Missouri), is an excerpt from Ten Acres Enough a book      penned by a fellow named James Miller away back in 1864.      Sure, the prices were lower back then but everything Mr.      Miller had to say 112 years ago is still being said in      almost exactly the same words by the average homesteader of      1976.    </p>    <p>      As the old saying goes, "The more things change ."    </p>    <p><strong>      CITY EXPERIENCES MODERATE EXPECTATIONS    </strong></p>    <p>      My life, up to the age of forty, had been spent in my      native city of Philadelphia. Like thousands of others      before me, I began the world without a dollar, and with a      very few friends in a condition to assist me. Having saved      a few hundred dollars by dint of close application to      business, and avoiding taverns, oyster houses, theatres,      and fashionable tailors, I married and went into business      the same year.    </p>    <p>      These two contemporaneous drafts upon my little capital      proving heavier than I expected, they soon used it up,      leaving me thereafter greatly straitened for means.    </p>    <p>      It is true my business kept me, but as it was constantly      expanding, and was of such a nature that a large proportion      of my annual gain was necessarily invested in tools,      fixtures, and machinery, I was nearly always short of ready      cash to carry on my operations with comfort. At certain      times, also, it ceased to be profitable.    </p>    <p>      The crisis of 1837 nearly ruined me, and I was kept      struggling along during the five succeeding years of hard      times, until the revival of 1842 came round. Previous to      this crisis, necessity had driven me to the banks for      discounts, one of the sore evils of doing business upon      insufficient capital. As is always the case with these      institutions, they compelled me to return the borrowed      money at the very time it was least convenient for me to do      so they needed it as urgently as myself. But to refund them      I was compelled to borrow elsewhere, and that too at      excessive rates of interest, thus increasing the burden      while laboring to shake it off.    </p>    <p>      Thousands have gone through the same unhappy experience,      and been crushed by the load. Such can anticipate my trials      and privations. Yet I was not insolvent. My property had      cost me far more than I owed, yet if offered for sale at a      time when the whole community seemed to want money only, no      one could have been found to give cost. I could not use it      as the basis of a loan, neither could I part with it      without abandoning my business.    </p>    <p>      Hence I struggled on through that exhausting crisis,      haunted by perpetual fears of being dishonored at bank      lying down at night, not to peaceful slumber, but to dream      of fresh expedients to preserve my credit for tomorrow.    </p>    <p>      I had always loved the country, but my wife preferred the      city. I could take no step but such as would be likely to      promote her happiness. So long as times continued fair, we      ceased to canvass the propriety of a removal. We had      children to educate, and to her the city seemed the best      and most convenient place for qualifying them for future      usefulness.    </p>    <p>      Then, most of our relations resided near us. Our habits      were eminently social. We had made numerous friends, and      among our neighbors there had turned up many valuable      families. We felt even the thought of breaking away from      all these cordial ties to be a trying one. But the refuge      of a removal to the country had taken strong hold of my      mind.    </p>    <p>      Indeed, it may be said that I was born with a passion for      living on a farm. It was fixed and strengthened by my long      experience of the business vicissitudes of city life.    </p>    <p>      For many years I had been a constant subscriber for several      agricultural journals, whose contents I read as carefully      as I did those of the daily papers. My wife also, being a      great reader, came in time to study them almost as      attentively.    </p>    <p>      Every thing I saw in the journals only tended to confirm my      longing for the country, while they gave definite views of      what kind of farming I was fit for. In fact they educated      me for the position before I assumed it. I am sure they      exercised a powerful influence in removing most of my      wife's objections to living in the country. I studied their      contents as carefully as did the writers who prepared them.      I watched the reports of crops, of experiments, and of      profits.    </p>    <p>      The leading idea in my mind was this that a man of ordinary      industry and intelligence, by choosing a proper location      within hourly reach of a great city market, could so      cultivate a few acres as to insure a maintenance for his      family, free from the ruinous vibrations of trade or      commerce in the metropolis. All my reading served to      convince me of its soundness. I did not assume that he      could get rich on the few acres which I ever expected to      own. But I felt assured that he could place himself above      want. I knew that his peace of mind would be sure. With me      this was dearer than all. My reading had satisfied me that      such a man would find Ten Acres Enough, and these I could      certainly command.    </p>    <p>      As I did not contemplate undertaking the management of a      large grain farm, so my studies did not run in that      direction. Yet I read every thing that came before me in      relation to such, and not without profit. But I graduated      my views to my means, and so noted with the utmost care the      experiences of the small cultivators who farmed five to ten      acres thoroughly. I noted their failures as watchfully as      their successes, knowing that the former were to be      avoided, as the latter were to be imitated.    </p>    <p>      As opportunity offered, I made repeated excursions, year      after year, in every direction around Philadelphia,      visiting the small farmers or truckers who supplied the      city market with fruit and vegetables, examining,      inquiring, and treasuring up all that I saw and heard.    </p>    <p>      The fund of knowledge thus acquired was not only      prodigious, but it has been of lasting value to me in my      subsequent operations. I found multitudes of truckers who      were raising large families on five acres of ground, while      others, owning only thirty acres, had become rich.    </p>    <p>      On most of these numerous excursions I was careful to have      my wife with me. I wanted her to see and hear for herself,      and by convincing her judgment, to overcome her evidently      diminishing reluctance to leaving the city. My uniform      consideration for her comfort at last secured the object I      had in view. She saw so many homes in which a quiet      abundance was found, so many contented men and women, so      many robust and bouncing children, that long before I was      ready to leave the city, she was quite impatient to be      gone.    </p>    <p><strong>      PRACTICAL VIEWS SAFETY OF INVESTMENTS IN LAND    </strong></p>    <p>      There was not a particle of romance in my aspirations for a      farm, neither had I formed a single visionary theory which      was there to be tested. My notions were all sober and      prosaic.    </p>    <p>      I had struggled all my life for dollars, because abundance      of them produces pecuniary comfort: and the change to      country life was to be, in reality, a mere continuation of      the struggle, but lightened by the assurance that if the      dollars thus to be acquired were fewer in number, the      certainty of earning enough of them was likely to be      greater. Crops might fail under skies at one time too      watery, at another too brassy, but no such disaster could      equal those to which commercial pursuits are      uninterruptedly exposed. They have brassy skies above them      as well as farmers.    </p>    <p>      For nearly twenty years I had been hampered with having      notes of my own or of other parties to pay. But of all the      farmers I had visited, only one had ever given a note, and      he had made a vow never to give another. My wife was shrewd      enough to observe and remark on this fact at the time, it      was so different from my own experience. She admitted there      must be some satisfaction in carrying on a business which      did not require the giving of notes.    </p>    <p>      Looking at the matter of removal to the country in a      practical light, I found that in the city I was paying      three hundred dollars per annum rent for a dwelling house.      It was the interest of five thousand dollars, yet it      afforded nothing but a shelter for my family.    </p>    <p>      I might continue to pay that rent for fifty years, without,      at the end of that time, having acquired the ownership of      either a stone upon the chimney, or a shingle in the roof.      If the house rose in value, the rise would be to the      owner's benefit, not to mine. It would really be injurious      to me, as the rise would lead him to demand an increase of      his rent.    </p>    <p>      But put the value of the house into a farm, or even the      half of it and the farm would have a dwelling house upon      it, in which my family would find as good a shelter, while      the land, if cultivated as industriously as I had always      cultivated business, would belie the flood of evidence I      had been studying for many years if it failed to yield to      my efforts the returns which it was manifestly returning to      others.    </p>    <p>      We could live contentedly on a thousand dollars a year on      the farm and we should have no landlord to pay. My wife, in      pinching times, has financiered us through the year on      several hundred less. I confess to having lived as well on      the diminished rations as I wanted to. Indeed, until one      tries it for himself, it is incredible what dignity there      is in an old hat, what virtue in a time worn coat, and how      savory. the dinner table can be made without sirloin steaks      or cranberry tarts.    </p>    <p>      Thus, let it be remembered, my views and aspirations had no      tinge of extravagance. My rule was moderation. The tortures      of a city struggle without capital, had sobered me down to      being contented with a bare competency.    </p>    <p>      I might fail in some particulars at the outset, from      ignorance, but I was in the prime of life, strong, active,      industrious, and tractable, and what I did not know I could      soon learn from others, for farmers have no secrets. Then I      had seen too much of the uncertainty of banks and stocks,      and ledger accounts, and promissory notes, to be willing to      invest any thing in either as a permanency. At best they      are fluctuating and uncertain, up today and down tomorrow.      My great preference had always been for land.    </p>    <p>      In looking around among my wide circle of city      acquaintances, especially among the older families, I could      not fail to notice that most of them had grown rich by the      ownership of land.    </p>    <p>      More than once had I seen the values of all city property,      improved and unimproved, apparently disappear: lots without      purchasers, and houses without tenants, the community so      poor and panic stricken that real estate became the merest      drug. Yesterday the collapse was caused by the destruction      of the National Bank, today it is the Tariff. Sheriffs      played havoc with houses and lands incumbered by mortgages,      and lawyers fattened on the rich harvest of fees      inaugurated by a Bankrupt Law.    </p>    <p>      But those who, undismayed by the wreck around them,      courageously held on to land, came through in safety. The      storm, having run its course and exhausted its wrath, gave      place to skies commercially serene, and real estate swung      back with an irrepressible momentum to its former value,      only to keep on advancing to one even greater. I became      convinced that safety lay in the ownership of land.    </p>    <p>      The reader may look back over every monetary convulsion he      may be able to remember, and he will find that in all of      them the agricultural community came through with less      disaster than any other interest. Wheat grows and corn      ripens though all the banks in the world may break, for      seed time and harvest is one of the divine promises to man,      never to be broken, because of its divine origin. They grew      and ripened before banks were invented, and will continue      to do so when banks and railroad bonds shall have become      obsolete.    </p>    <p>      What, then, is the safest fund in which to invest, in this      country? What is the only fund which the experience of the      last fifty years has shown, with very few exceptions, would      be absolutely safe as a provision for heirs? How many men,      within that period, assuming to act as trustees for      estates, have kept the trust fund invested in stocks, and      when distributing the principal among the heirs, have found      that most of it had vanished! Under corporate insolvency it      had melted into air. No prudent man, accepting such a      trust, and guaranteeing its integrity, would invest the      fund in stocks.    </p>    <p>      But lands, or a fund secured by real estate, is      unquestionably not only the highest security, but in the      hands of heirs it is the only one likely to survive a      single generation.    </p>    <p>      Hence the wisdom of the common law, which neither permits      the guardian to sell the lands of his ward, nor even the      court, in its discretion, to grant authority for their      sale, except upon sufficient grounds shown: as a necessity      for raising a fund for the support and education of the      ward. Even a lord chancellor can only touch so sacred a      fund for this or similar reasons. The common law is wise on      this subject, as on most others. It is thus the experience      and observation of mankind that such a fund is the safest,      and hence the provisions of the law.    </p>    <p><strong>      PRACTICAL VIEWS SAFETY OF INVESTMENTS IN LAND    </strong></p>    <p>      There was not a particle of romance in my aspirations for a      farm, neither had I formed a single visionary theory which      was there to be tested.

I need not recapitulate them here, as too many      of them are yet dark spots on the memory of some who will      read this. Their frequency, as well as their recurrence at      shorter intervals than at the beginning of the century, are      among their most remarkable features, baffling the      calculations of older heads, and confounding those of      younger ones.    </p>    <p>      As the century advanced, these convulsions increased in      number and violence. The whole business horizon seemed full      of coming storms, which burst successively with desolating      severity, not only on merchants and manufacturers, but on      others who had long before retired from business. No one      could foresee this state of things. I will not stop to      argue causes, but confine myself to facts which none will      care to contradict.    </p>    <p>      These disasters made beggars of thousands in every branch      of business, and spread discouragement over every      community. I passed through several of them, striving and      struggling, and oppressed beyond all power of description.      How many more the community was to encounter I did not      know. But I conceived it the part of prudence to place      myself beyond the circle of their influence before I also      had been prostrated.    </p>    <p>      In spite of the losses thus encountered, I had been saving      something annually for several years, when the stricture of      1854 came on, premonitory of the tremendous crash of 1857.    </p>    <p>      The trials of that incipient crisis determined me to      abandon the city. I found that by realizing all I then      possessed, I could command means enough to purchase ten to      twenty acres, and I had grown nervous and apprehensive of      the future. While possessed of a little, I resolved to make      that little sure by investing it in land. I had worked for      the landlord long enough. My excellent wife was now      entirely willing to make the change, and our six children      clapped their hands with joy when they heard that "father      was going to live in the country."    </p>    <p>      I had long determined in my mind what sort of farming was      likely to prove profitable enough to keep us with comfort,      and that was the raising of small fruits for the city      markets. My attention had always been particularly directed      to the berries. Some strawberries I had raised in my city      garden with prodigious success.    </p>    <p>      My friends, when they heard of my project, expressed fears      that the market would soon be glutted, not exactly by the      crops which I was to raise, but they could not exactly      answer how. They confessed that they were extremely fond of      berries, and that at no time in the season could they      afford to eat enough a confession which seemed to explode      all apprehension of the market being overstocked.    </p>    <p>      But my wife and myself had both examined the hucksters who      called at the door with small fruits, as to the monstrous      prices they demanded, and had begged them, if ever a glut      occurred, that they would call and let us know. But none      had ever called with such information. It was the same      thing with those who occupied stalls in the various city      markets. They rarely had a surplus left unsold, and their      prices were always high. A glut of fruit was a thing almost      unknown to them. It was a safe presumption that the market      would not be depressed by the quantity that I might raise.    </p>    <p>      But here let me say something by way of parenthesis,      touching this common idea of the danger of overstocking the      fruit market of the great cities. It is a curious fact that      this idea is entertained only by those who are not fruit      growers. The latter never harbored it. Their whole      experience runs the other way, they know it to be a gross      absurdity. Yet somehow, the question of a glut has always      been debated.    </p>    <p>      Twenty years ago the nurserymen were advised to close up      their sales and abandon the business, as they would soon      have no customers for trees since everybody was supplied.      But trees have continued to be planted from that day to      this, and where hundreds were sold twenty years ago,      thousands are disposed of now. Old established nurseries.      have been trebled in size, while countless new ones have      been planted. The nursery business has grown to a magnitude      truly gigantic, because the market for fruit has been      annually growing larger, and no business enlarges itself      unless it is proved to be profitable.    </p>    <p>      The market cannot be glutted with good fruit. The      multiplication of mouths to consume it is far more rapid      than the increase of any supply that growers can effect.      Within ten years the masses have had a slight taste of      choice fruits, and but little more. Indulgence has only      served to whet their appetites. The more of them there is      offered in the market, the more will there be consumed.    </p>    <p>      Every huckster in her shamble, every vender of peanuts in      the street, will testify to this. The modern art of semi      cookery for fruit, and of preserving it in cans and jars,      has made sale for enormous quantities of those choicer      kinds which return the highest profit to the grower. It is      in the grain market that panic often rages, but never in      the fruit market. If it ever enters the latter, the      struggle is to obtain the fruit, not to get rid of it.    </p>    <p><strong>      BUYING A FARM A LONG SEARCH ANXIETY TO SELL FORCED TO QUIT    </strong></p>    <p>      I had in round numbers a clear two thousand dollars, with      which to buy and stock a farm, and keep my family while my      first crops were growing. As I was entirely free from debt,      so I determined to avoid it in the future. Debt had been      the bitter portion of my life, not from choice, but of      necessity. My wife took strong ground in support of this      resolution what we had she wanted us to keep.    </p>    <p>      I had settled it in my mind that I would use one thousand      dollars in the purchase of land, and that I could make Ten      Acres Enough. This I was determined to pay for at once, and      have it covered by no man's parchment. But when we set out      on our search, we found some difficulties.    </p>    <p>      Every county in New Jersey contained a hundred farms that      were for sale. Most of them were too large for my slender      purse, though otherwise most eligibly situated. Then we      must have a decent house, even if we were forced to put up      with less land.    </p>    <p>      Numerous locations of this kind were offered. The trouble      was keeping my slender purse in view that the farms were      either too large or too small. My wife was not fastidious      about having a fine house. On the contrary, I was often      surprised to find her pleased with such as to me looked      small and mean. Indeed, it seemed, after ten days' search,      that the tables had been turned she was more easily suited      than myself. But the same deference which I paid to her      wishes, she uniformly paid to mine.    </p>    <p>      It was curious to note the anxiety of so many land owners      to sell, and to hear the discordant reason which they gave      for desiring to do so. The quantity in market was enormous.      All the real estate agents had large books filled with      descriptions of farms and fancy country seats for sale,      some to be had by paying one fourth of the purchase money      down, and some which the owners would exchange for      merchandise, or traps, or houses in the city.    </p>    <p>      Many of the sellers appeared simply to want something else      for what they already had. They were tired of holding, and      desired a change of some kind, better if they could make      it, and worse if they could not. City merchants, or      thriving mechanics, had built country cottages, and then      wearied of them it was found inconvenient to be going to      and fro in fact, they had soon discovered that the city      alone was their place. Many such told us that their wives      did not like the country.    </p>    <p>      Others had bought farms and spent great sums in improving      them, only to sell at a loss. Farming did not pay an owner      who lived away off in the city. Another class had taken      land for debt, and wanted to realize. They expected to lose      anyhow, and would sell cheap,.    </p>    <p>      Then there was another body of owners who, though born and      raised upon the land, were tired of country life, and      wanted to sell and embark in business in the city. Some few      were desirous of going to the West. Change of some kind      seemed to be the general craving.    </p>    <p>      As I discovered that much of all this land was covered with      mortgages of greater or less amount, it was natural to      suppose the sheriff would occasionally turn up, and so it      really was. 'there were columns in some of the county      papers filled with his advertisements. I sometimes thought      the whole country was for sale.    </p>    <p>      But yet there was a vast body of owners, many of them      descendants of the early settlers, whom no consideration of      price could tempt to abandon their inheritances. They      seemed to know and understand the value of their ancestral      acres. We met with other parties, recent purchasers, who      had bought for a permanency, and who could not be induced      to sell.    </p>    <p>      In short, there seemed to be two constantly flowing streams      of people one tending from city to country, the other from      country to city. Doubtless it is the same way with all our      large cities. I think the latter stream was the larger. If      it were not so, our cities could not grow in population at      a rate so much more rapid than the country. At numerous      farm houses inquiries were made if we knew of any openings      in the city in which boys and young men could be placed.      The city was evidently the coveted goal with too large a      number.    </p>    <p>      This glut of the land market did not discourage us. We      could not be induced to believe that land had no value      because so many were anxious to dispose of it. We saw that      it did not suit those who held it, and knew that it would      suit us. But we could not but lament over the infatuation      of many owners, who we felt certain would be ruined by      turning their wide acres into money, and exposing it to the      hazards of an untried business in the city. I doubt not      that many of the very parties we then encountered have,      long before this, realized the sad fate we feared, and      learned too late that lands are better than merchandise.    </p>    <p>      One morning, about the middle of March, we found the very      spot we had been seeking. It lay upon the Amboy Railroad,      within a few miles of Philadelphia, within gunshot of a      railroad station, and on the outskirts of a town containing      churches, schools, and stores, with quite an educated      society.    </p>    <p>      The grounds comprised eleven acres, and the dwelling house      was quite large enough for my family. It struck the fancy      of my wife the moment we came up to it; and when she had      gone over the house, looked into the kitchen, explored the      cellar, and walked round the garden, she expressed the      strongest desire to make it our home.    </p>    <p>      There was barn enough to accommodate a horse and cow, with      a ton or two of hay, quite an extensive shed, and I noticed      that the barnyard contained a good pile of manure which was      to go with the property. The buildings were of modern date,      the fences were good, and there was evidence that a former      occupant had exercised a taste for fruit and ornamental      trees, while the garden was in very fair condition.    </p>    <p>      But the land had been wholly neglected. All outside of the      garden was a perfect scarecrow of tall weeds, thousands of      which stood clear up to the fence top, making sure that      they had scattered seeds enough for twenty future crops.    </p>    <p>      Still, I noticed that the land directly opposite our      potential farm was in the most admirable condition, and I      saw at a glance that the soil must be adapted to the very      purpose to which it was to be applied. The opposite ground      was matted with a luxuriant growth of strawberries, while      rows of stalwart raspberries held up their vigorous canes      in testimony of the goodness of the soil. A fine peach      orchard on the same neighboring property, seemed impatient      to put forth and blossom unto harvest.    </p>    <p>      The eleven acres we were considering could be no worse land      than this, and though I had a horror of weeds, yet I was      not to be frightened by them. I knew that weeds were more      indigenous to New Jersey than even watermelons.    </p>    <p>      This miniature plantation of eleven acres belonged to a      merchant in the city. He had taken it to secure a debt of      eleven hundred dollars, but had pledged himself to pay the      former owner whatever excess over that sum he might obtain      for it. But pledges of that loose character seldom amount      to much since the creditor consults his own interest, not      that of the debtor.    </p>    <p>      The debtor had long been trying to sell, but in vain, and      now the creditor had become equally embarrassed, and needed      money even more urgently than the debtor had done.    </p>    <p>      The whole property had cost the debtor eighteen hundred      dollars and his views in founding it were similar to mine.      He meant to establish for himself a home, to which at some      future period he might retire. But he made the sad mistake      of continuing in business in the city, and one disaster      succeeding another, he had been compelled to abandon his      anticipated refuge nearly a year before we came along.    </p>    <p><strong>      MAKING A PURCHASE FIRST IMPRESSIONS    </strong></p>    <p>      The owner of these eleven acres had been for some months in      the furnace of pecuniary affliction. He was going the way      of ninetenths of all the business flesh within the circle      of my acquaintance.    </p>    <p>      As a purchaser I did not seek the owner, nor to his      representative did myself or my wife let fall a single word      indicating that we were pleased with tire property. when      fifteen hundred dollars were named as the price, I did      indulge in some expression of surprise, thinking it was      quite enough.    </p>    <p>      Discovering subsequently that the owner was an old city      acquaintance, I dropped in one morning to see him, and for      an hour we talked over the times, the markets, the savage      rates demanded for money, and how the spring business was      likely to turn out. On real estate I was mute as a mouse,      except giving it as my decided opinion that some holders      were asking greater prices than they would be likely to      realize This side thrust brought my friend out. He      mentioned his house and eleven acres, and eagerly inquired      if I did not know of some one who would buy.    </p>    <p>      With as much indifference as I could assume, I asked the      owner his terms. He told me with great frankness that he      was compelled to sell, and that his need of money was so      great, that he might possibly do so whether the debtor got      anything or not. He urged me to find him a purchaser, and      finally gave me the refusal of the place for a few days.    </p>    <p>      Now, the plain truth was, that my anxiety to buy was quite      as great as his. was to sell. During the next week we met      several times, when he invariably inquired as to the      prospect of a purchaser. But I had no encouragement to      offer.    </p>    <p>      When I thought I had fought shy long enough, I surprised      the owner by saying that I knew of a purchaser who was      ready to take the property at a thousand dollars. He sat      down and indulged in some figuring, then for a few moments      was silent, then inquired if the offer was 'a cash one, and      when the money could be had. I replied, the moment his deed      was ready for delivery.    </p>    <p>      It was evident that the offer of instant payment determined      him to sell at so low a price: cash was everything. Opening      his desk, he took out a deed for the property, ready to      execute whenever the grantee's name, the date and the      consideration should have been inserted, handed it to me,      and said he accepted the offer if he could have the money      as quickly as possible.    </p>    <p>      I confess to both exultation and surprise. I had secured an      unmistakable bargain, The ready made deed surprised me, but      it showed the owner's necessities, and that he had been      prepared to let the property go at the first decent offer.      The natural selfishness of human nature has since induced      me to believe that I could have bought for even less, had I      not been so precipitate. His searches and brief of title      were also ready: a single. day or two was enough to bring      them up. He had been determined to sell.    </p>    <p>      The transaction seemed to involve a succession of      surprises. The owner's came when he found that I had      inserted my wife's name in the deed. So, paying him his      thousand dollars, I returned with the deed to my wife,      telling her that she had now a home of her own. That, come      what might, the property was hers. That the laws of New      Jersey secured it to her, and that no subsequent      destitution of mine could wrest it from her.    </p>    <p>      This little act of consideration was as gratifying a      surprise to my wife as any that either buyer or seller had      experienced. If she had rejoiced at my having secured the      place, this added twist gave the transaction a new interest      in her estimation, and fixed and made permanent the      attachment she had spontaneously acquired for it. Her      gratification only served to increase my own.    </p>    <p>      It is thus that small acts of kindness make life pleasant      and desirable. Every dark object is made light by them, and      many scalding tears of sorrow are thus easily brushed away.      When the heart is sad, and despondency sits at the entrance      of the soul, a little kindness drives despair away, and      makes the path cheerful and pleasant.    </p>    <p>      Who then will refuse a kind act? It costs the giver nothing      but it is invaluable to the receiver. No broader acres, no      more stately mansion, whether in town or country, could now      tempt my wife to leave this humble refuge. Here she has      been ever happy, and here, I doubt not, she will end her      earthly career.    </p>    <p>      In a week the house was vacated and cleansed, and we were      in full possession. My wife was satisfied, my children were      delighted, and I had realized the dream of twenty years!    </p>    <p>      One strong fact forced itself on my attention the first      night I passed under my new roof. The drain of three      hundred dollars per annum into the pocket of my city      landlord had been stopped. My family received as safe a      shelter for the interest of a thousand dollars, as he had      given them for the interest of five thousand!    </p>    <p>      The feeling of relief from this unappeasable demand was      indescribable. Curiously enough, my wife voluntarily      suggested that the same feeling of relief had been      presented to her. But in addition to this huge equivalent      for the investment of a thousand dollars, there was that      which might be hereafter realized from the cultivation of      eleven acres of land.    </p>    <p>      This lodgment was effected on the first of April, 1855.      When all our household fixings had been snugly arranged,      and I took my first walk over my little plantation, on a      soft and balmy morning, my feeling of contentment seemed to      be perfect.    </p>    <p>      I knew I was not rich, but it was certain that I was not      poor. In contrasting my condition with that of others, both      higher and lower upon fortune's ladder, I found a thousand      causes for congratulation, but none for regret.    </p>    <p>      With all his wealth, Rothschild must be satisfied with the      same sky that was spread over me. He cannot order a private      sunrise, that he may enjoy it with a select circle of      friends, nor add a single glory to the gorgeous spectacle      of the setting sun. The millionaire could not have more      than his share of the pure atmosphere that I was breathing,      while the poorest of all men could have as much. God only      can give all these, and to many of the poor he has thus      given.    </p>    <p>      All that is most valuable can be had for nothing. They come      as presents from the hand of an indulgent Father, and      neither air nor sky, nor beauty, genius, health, or      strength, can be bought or sold. Whatever may be one's      condition in life, the great art is to learn to be content      and happy, indulging in no feverish longings for what we      have not, but satisfied and thankful for what we have,    </p>    <p>      I had no sooner made myself snug upon my little farm when      the tornado of 1857 toppled my former establishment into      utter ruin. My successor was made a bankrupt, and his      business was destroyed, leaving him overwhelmed with debt.      He had lost all, while I had saved all. Had I not sold when      I did, and secured what the sale yielded me, I too should      have been among the wrecks of that terrific visitation.    </p>    <p>      But I heard its warring in the quiet of my little farm      house, where it brought me neither anxiety nor loss. My      position was like that of one sitting peacefully by his      wintry fireside, gazing on the thick storm without, and      listening to the patter of tire snow flakes as the tempest      drove them angrily against the window pane, while all      within was calm and genial.    </p>    <p>      Instead of regrets for what I had failed to grasp, my heart      overflowed with thankfulness for the comparative abundance      that remained to me. My peace of mind was perfect. The      unspeakable satisfaction was felt of being out of business,      out of debt, and out of danger. Not rich, but possessed of      enough.    </p>    <p>      The thoughtful reader may well believe that subsequent      disturbances, rebellion, war, and even a more wide spread      bankruptcy from all of which my humble position made me      secure have only served to intensify my gratitude to that      Divine Providence which so mercifully shaped my ways.    </p>
