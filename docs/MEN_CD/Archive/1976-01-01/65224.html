    <p>
                    <p>      Once again, we must take strong exception to all the      Washington politicians and economists who are trying to      bring back the economic "good times" of the 1950's and      1960's with mirrors, hot air, and wishful thinking.    </p>    <p>      In the first place, those "good times"-with their suddenly      intensified use of strip mining, clear-cutting, and other      "more efficient" methods of exploiting the earth-were not      at all good times for the planet. More species of plants,      birds, and animals were hounded into extinction more square      miles of irreplaceable ecosystems were paved over or plowed      under more new forms of pollution (and substantially more      tons of most old pollutants) were spewed into the air,      dumped into the water, and spread across the land by man      during the 1950's and 60's than during any earlier 20-year      period of Homo sapiens' short reign upon (and misuse of)      this beautiful Big Blue Marble we ride through space. (Of      course, we're doing our damndest to break that pollution      record right now.)    </p>    <p>      In the second place, those "good times" of the 50's and      60's weren't really so good at all for exceptionally large      chunks of the world's people: Hundreds of millions of      blacks, browns, reds, yellows, and whites continued-en      masse-to be forced to work as slaves, tortured, persecuted,      raped, displaced, dispossessed, disinherited, and,      murdered. Whole countries disappeared and entire nations      lost control of their destinies during those "good" twenty      years.    </p>    <p>      And, in the third place, many-if not most-of the      individuals living even in the Western countries that did      boom throughout much of the 50's and 60's (the U.S.,      Canada, western Europe, etc.) also failed to share in the      real wealth of that boom. Sure, we've all had more plastic      geegaws to buy and the paper dollars to buy them with.    </p>    <p>      But how many more of us now own land that a bureaucrat      can't arbitrarily take away? How many more of us now own      our own businesses? How many more now walk the streets of      our "great" cities in safety? How many more actually feel      that our lives are deeply satisfying? How many more think      their savings will really be worth something when they      retire? How many more of us now even feel secure in our own      homes with all the doors double-latched, a pistol in the      bureau drawer, and a German shepherd curled up on the      floor? And that's the Good News.    </p>    <p>      The Bad News is that the free ride (which, as noted, even      at best wasn't all that good) is over. The most fertile      land is already being farmed. The fossil fuels are drying      up. The most easily exploited resources of all kinds have      already been tapped. And there's more of us every year to      use what's left.    </p>    <p>      There are, in short, too many people expecting too much and      not enough to go around. It is simply no longer possible      for New York City to keep 1,200,000 of its residents alive      with welfare payments and to pay back the 160,000 small,      middle class investors who trusted the city enough to loan      it money. Forget the big banks and the politicians and the      weak administrators in the middle who caused it all (and      who profited, now profit, and will continue to profit from      the NYC mess). Think just about the little people on either      end: Now that there's no longer enough to go around, which      ones are you going to cut off? The welfare recipients or      the trusting investors who put their life savings into your      bonds?    </p>    <p>      And New York City, of course, is only the beginning. Only a      teenie, tiny, little, playacting dress rehearsal for the      real day of reckoning that has to catch up with us all      sooner or later.    </p>    <p>      Because just like NYC we've all been living beyond our      means. And now again, just like NYC we're all starting to      get found out. We're running out of everything food, fuel,      minerals, ozone, clean air, pure water-except people.      There's simply not enough to go around anymore. And      there'll be even less, per capita, tomorrow. And less the      day after that. And less and less and less.    </p>    <p>      And as we all begin to try to "get ours" while we think the      gettin's still good, the planet and a lot of little people      are going to get hurt.    </p>    <p>      You think we've got big strip mining equipment now? You      ain't seen nothin' yet. Just wait until we're really      desperate for that coal and that iron ore and that bauxite.      You think the pollution is bad now? Just wait until the      issue of "jobs or a few fish" really begins to heat up. You      think processed food is tasteless, chemical-laced, and      expensive now? Just wait till we're all eating seaweed,      pulverized rocks, and chocolate-flavored bacteria. You      think that retired people and others living on fixed      incomes have it rough now? Just wait until it really gets      down to a question of "us or them" (and-unfortunately-by      long before that comes to pass, you'll probably be a "them"      yourself). You think crime, inflation, shoddy goods,      bureaucratic highhandedness, terrorism, political      infighting, and such other products of "progress" are bad      now? Friend, you just ain't seen the way it's gonna be.    </p>    <p>      Long term, then, the quality of life has to deteriorate      possibly quite drastically and much faster than you care to      imagine.    </p>    <p>      Short term? Anything can happen as politicians and      economists all rush to center stage with contradictory      "cures" for what each "leader" believes (probably      mistakenly) ails us.    </p>    <p>      And so, once again, we'll stick by the economic guidelines      we first suggested in mid-May of 1975: Just as Walter      Prescott Webb predicted 25 years ago (see The Plowboy      Interview in MOTHER NO. 32), Western Man's 450-year-long      expansionary binge-which was fueled by cheap, plentiful      energy and other resources-is now drawing to a close. And,      just as predicted, the industrialized nations of the world      are having a difficult time understanding what's happening      to them. The sooner our "leaders" realize this and begin      converting the world's countries to a steady state economy,      the better.    </p>    <p>      Still, there's no need for you to wait until those leaders      wise up. The time was never better for you and your family      to make the necessary conversion on your own. If you      haven't already done so, learn to become as food and energy      self-sufficient as possible and do it. Strive, also, for      economic self-sufficiency: Learn a basic trade or set up a      home business that will always be in demand and which you      or your family can control. Pay off all bills. Tear up      credit cards. Put yourself on a pay-as-you-go basis. Stock      up on quality tools and books that will help you live      better for less by growing your own food, building the      things you need, etc.    </p>    <p>      It seems a certainty that we'll all be walking a tightrope      between potentially catastrophic economic busts and just as      potentially catastrophic booms during at least the next ten      years. Those who insulate themselves best from our "modern,      interdependent" way of life will probably fare best during      the roller-coaster ride ahead.    </p>    <p>      And what if the worst of either extreme-boom or but doesn't      come to pass? Great! You'll still be ahead of the game as      you enjoy the satisfactions of self-sufficiency and      independence. Economic virtue even in "normal" times is its      own reward.    </p>
