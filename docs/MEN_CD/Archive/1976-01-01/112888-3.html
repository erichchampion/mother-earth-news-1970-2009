        Figure 4. It must accept all the strain of slapping over waves and plowing into surf. In fact, the joining plate shown in the diagram probably represents the inside limit on size. You could easily extend yours to reach all the way between the two nearest ribs. The bigger the plate, the firmer the joint. Next, fasten a beveled 1x2 chine along the inside bottom of each side. (Remember, you'll have a "right" and a "left"!) Each chine is beveled so the sides will slope up and outward from the floor at a "flair angle." Then, 1x1 ribs can be joined to the chines as shown. The transom is also pictured here, but should not yet be fixed in place.
