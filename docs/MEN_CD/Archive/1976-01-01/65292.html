                    <p>      One of the world's most effective environmental groups is      San francisco-basd FRIENDS OF EARTH. Although FOE publishes      Not Man Apart - a monthly tabloid magazine packed with      authenticated, hard-to-find facts that every concerned      citizen needs - far too few of MOTHER's readers regularyly      see a copy of NMA. We are therefore quite pleased that      FOE's staff has agreed to write a regular FRIENDS OF THE      EARTH column for THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.    </p>    <p><strong>      PASS THE POLLUTION, PLEASE    </strong></p>    <p>      Have you ever heard of "exporting" pollution? Well, it's a      fact: To get around their own nations' clean air and water      regulations, some businesses move factories and operations      to countries where labor is cheaper and governments are      less cautious about environmental protection. We're glad to      report, however, that a recent United States court decision      on the proposed Darien Gap highwaya U.S.-funded      roadbuilding project that would cut through the jungles of      Panama and Colombia-may help put an end to some of this      particular brand of international finagling.    </p>    <p>      The ruling (which marks the first time a domestic court has      considered the effects of a U.S. enterprise overseas) says      that the Darien Gap project must conform to United States      regulations, even though the highway will not be built in      this country. In other words, the road has been stopped      until a required environmental impact report is prepared,      filed, and approved.    </p>    <p>      And once that statement is compiled, it will (or at least      it should) point out a factor that may be the project's      final undoing: Road construction in the area planned will      cause the cultural extinction of that region's nomadic      Choco and Cuna Indians.    </p>    <p>      For centuries, as you're probably aware, the Chocos and      Cunas have coaxed a bare existence from the jungle by      clearing a patch of land, planting mixed crops there for a      season or two, and then moving on (which allows the      depleted soil to "rest"). The highway would bring in new      people and more development, which would limit both the      availability of potential cropland and the Indians'      necessary freedom to move around. The result of the new      "stability"? Bye-bye Indians. Goodbye soil.    </p>    <p>      As it stands today, the court's decision applies only to      federally funded projects but it's a step in the right      direction. Friends of the Earth is working toward the day      when no industry will be allowed to rip off another culture      or country for the sake of profit.    </p>    <p><strong>      NUCLEAR NEWS: <br />      THE HOT ATOMIC CONTROVERSY    </strong></p>    <p>      The "nuke" battle is heating up as quickly as a runaway      reactor especially in California, where voters will decide      in June on a nuclear safeguards initiative. If passed, the      measure won't necessarily ban atomic-based power (even      though industry spokesmen are making claims to the      contrary), but it will require that the state legislature      determine ( whether or not nuclear plants are safe, and (      if the existing limits on liability insurance should be      continued or abolished. (If a serious reactor accident were      to occur today, victims would recover only pennies on every      dollar's worth of loss and a good many people want that      situation changed.) Petition drives for similar nuclear      postponement measures are now underway in the states of      Maine and Oregon.    </p>    <p>      San Diego's General Atomic (a reactor manufacturing      subsidiary of Gulf Oil) recently bowed out of the nuclear      picture "for the time being". The corporation's ill-fated      business ventures have apparently lost around $500 million      most of which was spent on the company's commercially      unsuccessful HTGR's (high-temperature gas-cooled reactors).      The power plants GA did manage to buildPeach Bottom 1 (in      Peach Bottom. Pennsylvania and Fort St. Vrain (in      Platteville, Colorado) have been plagued with costly delays      and pesky operation troubles. Adios, General Atomic.    </p>    <p>      The utilities industry is beginning to realize that      uraniumwhich is the fuel that feeds all nuclear reactors      today-is a very limited resource. Ralph Lapp, a well-known      spokesman for the corporate "powers that be", recently      warned that no new ore-producing areas have been discovered      in the past 17 years which means, in effect, that we'll      soon be running out of the radioactive material. One      consulting geologist has said that "potential supply from      known reserves of uranium is insufficient to satisfy      project demand in the Western world as a whole beyond      1979", and that " very large shortfalls in supply may be      anticipated in the first half of the 1980's". From all      indications, electric power companies aren't going to be      able to keep their reactors running unless they find nine      new producing regions equal in size to the entire Colorado      Plateau (which occupies an area of several thousand miles).    </p>    <p>      Nuclear supporters, of course, say the obvious way out of      the bind is to push development of the breeder reactor,      which makes its own "fuel" as it operates. Trouble is, that      particular power producer is years away from design      completion no one is sure if it will "breed" fuel fast      enough anyway and it presents safety problems of a      magnitude that makes an ordinary reactor look as harmless      as a wood stove.    </p>    <p>      Back in the late 1960's and early 1970's, Westinghouse      Electric a major manufacturer of nuclear power plants-was      trying hard to get reactor construction contracts so hard,      in fact, that the company "sweetened" its offers by      promising potential clients "cheap" uranium. At the time,      the ore was relatively inexpensive (about $6.00 a pound),      and the company thought costs would eventually go even      lower. But something went wrong: The price of uranium has      skyrocketed (and will probably continue to do so) and      Westinghouse now figures to lose around $127.5 million      every year trying to live up to its premature promises.      Worse yet, the company projects that if today's trends      continue-it will suffer a whopping $1.5 billion loss      between 1979 and 1982 alone.    </p>    <p>      What to do? Well, Westinghouse is looking for a legal way      out of its obligations but the utilities (including      Wisconsin Electric, Union Electric, and a good many others)      have filed suits to force the company to come through with      its original offers. Needless to say, Westinghouse is not      pleased at the prospect.    </p>    <p>      The Australian Council of Trade Unions which represents 37      unions and 380,000 Aussie workers-has called for a ban on      the mining and exportation of that country's uranium. The      resolution (which defied an executive committee      recommendation) begins, "In view of the danger of global      radioactive pollution, the threat of nuclear proliferation,      and the problems of disposing of radioactive waste " and      goes on to forbid selling Australian uranium to countries      that want to use the material for anything other than      medical research and therapy. Since a large chunk of the      world's uranium reserves is down under, the ACTU's      admirable move should prove to be very significant indeed.    </p>    <p>      One frequent argument for nuclear power is that building      all those reactors, recycling plants, and waste disposal      facilities will provide jobs for thousands of unemployed      workers but a utility organization's own research suggests      otherwise. "In 1971," reports an Edison Electric Institute      pamphlet, "the electric industry had an average capital      investment of $224,230 behind each of its employees and      during the past ten years, average investment has shown an      increase of 84 percent, an indication of the increased      efficiency in the use of manpower in the industry."    </p>    <p>      What this statement reveals is that while a significant      amount of "new" money has been poured into utility      companies to foster growth over the past decade-there has      not been a correspondingly large upswing in the number of      jobs created as a result of that growth. In fact, it would      seem that if you're trying to increase employment-money      invested in any other industry but utilities would be      considerably more productive. For instance: In 1968 (again      according to EEI's own figures) it took an average of      $173,370 in capital investment to sustain one job in      electric utilities, while only $15,720 were required to      keep a person working in the lumber and wood products      industry. That's eleven jobs to one, folks for the same      amount of money.    </p>    <p>      As the dream of "cheap", "safe" nuclear energy fades, many      companies are finding themselves holding the proverbial bag      they've spent huge numbers of bucks for unreliable power      plants, and are now shelling out even more to keep the      "iffy" facilities running. For the most part, the utilities      have simply had to grin and .bear the situation but now the      tide is turning.    </p>    <p>      A landmark suit, asking for $150 million in damages, has      been filed by Nebraska Public Power District against      General Electric, Westinghouse, and a number of others in      the nuclear family. The problem? A series of expensive      delays and mishaps have cost NPPD a bundle and the utility      blames the vendors and contractors for providing faulty      equipment and service. The strange thing is that the plant      in question (the 778-megawatt Cooper site, near Brownville,      Nebraska) is no worse than most other facilities. If the      litigation is successful, a good many more utility      companies with similar problems may take their troubles to      court, too.    </p>    <p><strong>      CALIFORNIA'S REDWOODS: DEAD WOODS?    </strong></p>    <p>      Conservationists have been saying so all along, and now the      federal government has officially agreed for the first      time: Logging around California's Redwood National Park is      wrecking the sanctuary.    </p>    <p>      A two-year study of the area by a team of United States      Geological Survey scientists concluded that increased      erosion has toppled 1,000-year-old redwoods and caused the      siltation of fishbearing pools. (Private surveys financed      by the lumber companies argue that most of the damage is      the result of natural forces but frankly, we don't believe      them.) Loggers have left piles of litter-tires, heaps of      gravel, cut logs, battered culvert pipes, and steel cables      all over the park. And what can be done about the damage?    </p>    <p>      Well, we hope the USGS report will convince California's      state board of forestry which has sole regulatory power      over the industryto adopt strict guidelines for (or a      complete ban on) logging near RNP. But the board seems to      be the timber companies bosom buddy, and hasn't really done      much in the past in terms of protecting the environment, so      it's probably more realistic to consider other      possibilities: such as leasing or buying the land      surrounding the park, or at least working for more      legislative regulation of logging areas and practices.    </p>    <p>      Our best hope right now is a bill that has been introduced      in Congress by Representative Phillip Burton of California.      The measure which would provide enough money to purchase      the watershed land surrounding vulnerable areas of the      preserve-would result in a bigger and more stable Redwood      National Park, set aside and protected for all of us to      enjoy. A letter in support of the bill, directed at your      Congressman, would certainly help.    </p>
