                    <p>      And now a direct from England - the world's most      conscientious ecology cartoon feature. A little overstated      for our American tastes, perhaps, but full of real meat,      notheless. Ah, if we only had a cartoon series like this on      our side of the pond! but, sincewe don't. MOTHER presents      Mr. Crabtree Crusades. <em>Man made rot is eating at the      heart of nature. We are despoiling the heritage of our      sons.

He wishes fiercely that it    should be that same world for Peter and all his generation    and future generations. He tells Peter of summer meadows,    woods, and stream banks where insects hummed and fluttered,    and flowers grew, untouched by sprays or any other malignant    work of man. Summer evenings, he recalls, had a soft warmth    seldom coming now, which brought on the wing hosts of moths,    bats, zooming beetles. Was this world, that had made magic of    his childhood, to be entirely denied to Peter and those after    him? Nature, given a chance, can still recover.</p>
