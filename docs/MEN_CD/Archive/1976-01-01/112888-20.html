        Figure 21. You can further finish and waterproof this seam by gluing and nailing a small trim piece along the outside (Fig. 21).<br /><p>This is it! Turn her over and ... finis! The structure of your boat is basically complete. At this point it won't go anywhere, but it will float. The sides, of course, will retain some flex until internal buttressing is installed, so it may be a good idea to keep the center frame in place until you've gotten your ship upright. Once flipped onto her belly, the vessel will collect rain, and you'll have your first genuine bilge water right in your own backyard!</p>
