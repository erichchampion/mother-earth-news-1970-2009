                    <hr />        <p>      As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      .Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.    </p>    <p>      Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farrh . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over again.    </p>    <p>      And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses!, and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly SO years.    </p>    <p>      Naturally (in more ways than one/, the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott .Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>Â°, P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered here-and      here only-where we ail can read what the Nearings have to      say.    </p>    <p>      My wife and I are just about ready to "make our move" to      the country. We have been spending our weekends (we both      work in the city right now) building a house and clearing      enough land to plant our first garden. We would be very      pleased if you would share with us your personal choices      for a small homestead library.    </p>    <p>      I got carried away looking through ourlibrary to answer      your question! Here's a list of more than twenty that we've      used and enjoyed:    </p>    <p>      Food First by Frances Moore Lappe and Joseph Collins      (Houghton Mifflin, 1977).    </p>    <p>      Diet for a Small Planet by Francis Moore Lappe (Ballantine,      1975).    </p>    <p>      Nature's Children by Juliette de BairacllLevy (Schocken,      1971).    </p>    <p>      Herbal Handbook for Everyone by Juliette de Bairacli Levy      (Branford, 1988).    </p>    <p>      Grow It! by Richard W.

If      so, what cultivation methods do you use? We raise no grain      except green corn. Our growing season is too short for      cereal grains, and-even if we could ripen the crop-we lack      the harvesting and processing facilities we'd need to make      graingrowing profitable.    </p>    <p>      When I first read Living the Good Life I was especially      impressed by the thoroughness of your planning . . .      particularly in the layout and upkeep of your gardens.    </p>    <p>      Ever since then I've wished that I could get a peek at your      garden planning book. Do you keep such a record (surely you      must) and could you give us an idea of its basic design and      layout?    </p>    <p>      Our"garden book" is a loose-leaf affair that is divided      Into sections according to use. For instance, we have one      "chapter" which is devoted exclusively to our twenty-odd      compost and sod piles. This section covers the "life" of      each heap . . . when it was begun, the date when we began      use of its contents, and whether that particular compost      was acid or alkaline.    </p>    <p>      The main body of the book lists a rowby-row and bed-by-bed      record of all of our gardens: types and names of plants      grown, sources of the various seeds, the planting dates,      and records of maturation and harvest . . . with, of      course, recommendations for the future.    </p>    <p>      Could you please tell me the most effective method of      attracting earthworms to a piece of land (it is heavily      laced with clay) that they now avoid almost completely?    </p>    <p>      You're going to have to lighten up that clay by adding      something to it. Sand will lighten clay soil, as will      sawdust, but compost is the single most important agency      for breaking up clay.    </p>    <p>      Our present Maine garden has a subsoil of yellow clay that      we've been working on for 25 years. Thanks primarily to the      use of large amounts of compost, that soil now has a high      humus content and can be worked after an ordinary rain      without sticking to our tools.    </p>    <p>      Is a stone wall strong enough to use underground? Can it      withstand the pressure and movement of the surrounding      earth?    </p>    <p>      A loose stone wall would not be particularly effective. Our      basement walls are built with forms filled with a      welltamped aggregate of clean stones and a lean mixture of      sticky concrete.    </p>    <p>      Do you think it's a good idea to raise children in a      "homestead lifestyle" during these difficult times? We've      tried both communal living and alternate educational      systems, and haven't found either to be particularly      helpful.    </p>    <p>      Children can readily adapt to-and participate intoday's      homestead life. Young people should be called upon to      contribute to the household . . . and to enjoy doing so.      Keep them away from television, and much in the company of      their peers. If you enjoy what you're doing, your children      will enjoy sharing in your work.    </p>    <p>      I've enjoyed many of your helpful and inspirational      writings and books. You folks have affected my life and I      appreciate your willingness to share. Now, as silly as it      may sound, I'm interested in knowing how you wash your      clothes . . . since I'm concerned about both the economic      and ecological impact of our three-person family's wash.    </p>    <p>      Laundry has never been a problem for us. When we lived in      Vermont I washed everything in the kitchen sink after      heating the water on our wood stove. Now, 28 years later,      I'm still doing It the same way. I do, when we have      exceptionally heavy and dirty articles, go to the      launderette. In all cases, of course, I use good old soap      powder and never detergents.    </p>    <p>      A lot of "city folk" seem to be going back to the land      these days. Our family has been considering this, and we      are saving money, but we know that the change will be      enormous and isn't to be taken lightly. Can you suggest any      sort of preparatory activity or training that might help us      to "make it", should we decide to try our hands at a      simpler lifestyle?    </p>    <p>      We recognize the difficulty and suggest that, while you're      still in the city, you read-carefully-all the descriptions      of homesteading that you can find in book or article form      (including our own book, Living the Good Life). Thenwhen      you do take the step from city to country life-pick a      district that you like, rent or buy a house there, find a      likely neighbor or famlly in your new location, and      "apprentice" yourselves to them for a period of time . . .      even as much as a year. Take part in their work, learn      their skills, and look upon this period as a valuable      educational experience. At the same time, put what you      learn into practice on your newly acquired property.    </p>    <p>      Your books and articles have made you quite wellknown. Do      you receive a lot of "fan mail"? If so, how much of this      correspondence are you able to answer, and how do you      budget your time to handle this task?    </p>    <p>      Yes, we do receive a lot of mail, and we try to answer all      of It as promptly as possible. We either find or make the      time, and often write our letters early in the morning,      before we get involved in our own work. We accept this      chore as an obligation which we should fulfill as one of      our contributions to the burgeoning homestead movement.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, we have kept ail of these letters (boxes of      'em) that relate to homesteading-including the requests to      visit and participate in our work-and have filed them      alphabetically, noting the interest, age, and geographic      location of the sender. Someday this collection may prove      to be a gold mine for some Ph. D candidate's thesis.    </p>    <p>      Do you ever make use of any of the "wild foods" that grow      on your homestead? If so, could you give me a partial list      of those that you find most useful? We generally find it      easier and more convenient to raise our food in the garden      rather than forage for it in the wilds. We are gardeners,      not Euell Gibbonites. We do, however, dig dandelions out of      our lawn when they're at the right stage, and we greatly      relish lamb's-quarters, a pro lific weed.    </p>    <p>      I have a regular infestation of small rabbits in my garden.      Last year I vowed to just "plant enough for all of us", but      the bunnies have increased in number and are taking too      large a share. Fences don't seem to faze them. Any      suggestions? I can't bring myself to kill the little      things.    </p>    <p>      You're right, ordinary fences won't stop them. We keep all      wild animals (and dogs) out of our gardens with a five-foot      stone wall which we built ourselves. The wall's foundation      is three feet deep-to resist frost heaves-and the structure      successfully thwarts burrowers, keeps out witch grass and      other weeds, and even confounds slugs (they get tired try      ing to climb It).    </p>    <p>      We have had poor results from our attempts to transplant      wild berries (from neighboring woods and streams) onto our      land. Blackberries and salmonberries have been particularly      difficult . . . they either die or remain stunted for long      periods. Could you give us some tips on what time of year      to transplant these berries, and-perhaps-on transplanting      techniques in general?    </p>    <p>      Why transplant wild berries? Why not just leave them In      their natural habitat and pick them there? Mankind has      spent centuries cultivating and breeding various wild      fruits, and the result of that work is an extensive variety      of domesticated berries and the like, available in western      countries. We realize that these may lack the tang of their      wild cousins, but they do give a greater yield-and are      available in far more varieties-than nature alone can      equal. Don't get too caught up In the "nature thing" . . .      why not grow good berries in your own garden-under your own      control-and pick the wild ones in the woods at the same      time?    </p>    <p>      Do you folks ever use "games", or any sort of evening      social activities? We would be especially interested in      activities that can be shared by two people . . . and that      have some educational value.    </p>    <p>      We don't play indoor or outdoor games. (Quite aside from      being too old for many of them, we never did dissipate our      energies in that way. An acquaintance once asked Scott to      play miniature golf with him, whereupon Scott replied,      "When I'm physically incompetent I'll play golf . . . and      when I'm mentally incompetent I'll play miniature golf."      We're not yet either physically or mentally incompetent, so      we don't play games.) We have no TV or radio, but we do      have a large collection of fine phonograph records, and an      extensive library of both contemporary books and classics.      In the evenings we usually read aloud to each other or      listen to good music that we've chosen. We might shell      beans or sort potatoes or ap ples, or do some knitting or      darning, or work on the next day's soup while we listen . .      . to get something constructive done. And every Sunday      evening we play fine records while watching the sun set      over the water in front of our house.    </p>    <p>      We will be settling a good three hours from any sort of      professional medical help. Our research (and advice) about      the sort of "homestead medicine chest" we should carry has      been largely contradictory. We would very much appreciate      your suggestions.    </p>    <p>      We have no medicine chest as such. We do not believe in      medications, and prefer to eat the right foods In place of      such things. We also fast one day a week, and occasionally      for longer periods during the year, to preserve our health.      Along with the medicinal effects of good food, we advocate      fresh air, sunshine, hard outdoor work, and periods of      relaxation. We do keep Band-Aids handy (and bandaging) for      binding wounds . . . in addition to tweezers for splinters,      rubbing alcohol for foot (and other) massages, and an aloe      plant and comfrey leaves for poultices. Our new homestead      is wonderful, but we were unlucky enough to settle in      during a particularly bad "tick year". This isn't a real      problem (aside from the Rocky Mountain spotted fever      possibilities) of coursewe just check the children and      animals at night (or whenever they come in from the woods      or fields)but do you know of some method of keeping these      pests away from stock and humans?    </p>    <p>      As far as we know there are no ticks in our neighborhood,      nor were there any in Vermont during our sojourn there . .      . so we've had no experience with them. We have been told,      however, that rubbing alcohol, kerosene, or turpentine will      kill the pests. You simply take a small bottle of one of      these liquids, turn it up over the tickspot (holding the      mouth of the bottle tight against the skin), and the tick      will drown. It's then quite easy to pick the parasite off.      I don't mean to sound trite, but most of the marriages that      I've known (those of friends, relatives, and one of my own)      since I've reached adulthood have fallen apart in the first      few years. Could you tell me anything that you've learned      about successfully living with another person? I suspect      that it's a vanishing skill.    </p>    <p>      First, there must be an area of common interest. Within      that area, there should be the widest possible range of      activities in which all members of the family can      participate while giving each other both mutual respect and      mutual aid. Each person must be considerate of the other's      failings, idiosyncrasies, and divergencies ... and both      partners should have free time to be on their own. Each      party, furthermore, should be sufficiently independent      (financially) of the other to be able to carry out his or      her own personally chosen interests. Of course love, added      to all of this, would be nice too.    </p>    <hr />
