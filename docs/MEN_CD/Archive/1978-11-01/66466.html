                <p>      Cynthia Carter knows how to take the chill out of a cold      winter morning. She just serves up sizzlin' hot . . .    </p>            <p>      Here's a recipe that the sausage lovers in your family are      sure to rave about: an easy to fix, economical (and      delicious) herb-flavored German oatmeal sausage!    </p>    <h3>      FROM PIG . . .    </h3>    <p>      Anyone who raises and slaughters his or her own hogs can      prepare the pork for this recipe at home. Just save the      tail, feet, head (minus the eyes), and any other edible      leftover scraps from a butchered pig. Scrub the pieces of      meat well and simmer 'em all day in a large pot. (Be sure      to replace any water that steams away as the pork cooks.)    </p>    <p>      Let the boiled meat cool-in the pot-overnight      and into the next afternoon, then pick the meat from the      bones and run it through a meat grinder. (If you don't      raise hogs, you can substitute three pounds of unseasoned      bulk pork sausage from the supermarket or butcher.)    </p>    <h3>      . . . TO PAN . . .    </h3>    <p>      Chop two medium onions into fine pieces and cook them in      three quarts of water until they're tender. Then add the      three pounds of ground boiled pork, about two teaspoons of      salt (to taste), a little pepper, one-eighth teaspoon each      of nutmeg and allspice, four teaspoons of summer savory      (three teaspoons of sage will do if you don't have savory),      and 18 ounces (1 pound, 2 ounces) of non-instant rolled      oats.    </p>    <p>      Boil the ingredients until the oatmeal and pork are done      (about fifteen minutes), let the mixture cool a bit, press      it into loaf pans, let the loaves cool completely, and wrap      them in wax paper and foil. They can be stored in the      'fridge or frozen for later use. (If that recipe sounds too      complicated, just mix the onion, water, pork, spices, and      oatmeal together . . . spread the mix in loaf pans . . .      and cook 'em in a medium oven for four hours.) . . .    </p>    <h3>      . . . TO DINNER PLATE    </h3>    <p>      When you're ready to eat the sausage (it's great with eggs      for breakfast or as a main dish at dinner time), all you      have to do is cut a few slices off a loaf and fry 'em in      butter or oil until they're golden brown and crispy.    </p>    <p>      This German oatmeal sausage has been a favorite with my      family for at least three generations. I'm sure you and      your folks will enjoy it every bit as much as we do.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER'S NOTE: My recipe tested tasters tried Ms. Carter's      sausage and rated it as very good indeed. They tell me that      raw ground pork can be used, too. Just fry it enough to      render out some of the fat before you add it to the other      ingredients. Have a hearty appetite!    </p>
