                    <hr />    <p>      About 20 years ago, American cooks began to rebel against      the hours they spent in the kitchen ... which prompted big      food companies to start pushing "convenience" fare. Now,      however-due largely to a general mistrust of the food      industry and fear of the chemical additives it uses to      color, flavor, and preserve its products there's a growing      trend back toward natural, unadulterated provisions. And to      lessen the time required to prepare such meals-there's now      a wide range of kitchen equipment available . . . including      the improved, modernized pressure cooker. With one of these      cookers, food can be cooked three times as fast as by      traditional methods while retaining more of its nutritional      value and using less energy.    </p>        <p>      Each of the following dinners for two can be prepared-the      whole menu at the same time in the same pot-in a three      quart pressure cooker. It is important, however, to keep      the level of the contents at least two inches below the lid      to avoid possibly clogging the pressure pot's steam vent.      Better use a larger cooker if you have big appetites!    </p>    <p>      PORK CHOPS WITH BROWNED POTATOES,<br />      CHEESED CAULIFLOWER, FIGS, CARROTS, AND STEAM-BAKED      APPLES<br />      Dessert Apples<br />      2 good-sized baking apples<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      2 tablespoons brown sugar<br />      2 tablespoons bitter orange marmalade<br />      2 tablespoons toasted slivered almonds<br />      2 tablespoons maple syrup<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      Main Dish<br />      <br />      1/3 cup raw bran flakes or bread crumbs 1 egg, lightly      beaten 2 tablespoons milk 2 center-cut loin or rib pork      chops, about 3/4-inch thick salt and freshly ground black      pepper to taste 4 tablespoons butter 2 medium potatoes,      peeled and sliced 3/8-inch thick 2 medium carrots, scraped      and halved lengthwise 1/2 cup white wine 6 (or so)      cauliflower 1/2 cup grated Swiss Gruydre cheese 4 whole      Kadota figs (usually available canned)    </p>    <p>      Core the apples about three-quarters of the way down and      peel the top one-third. Set each one on a square of      aluminum foil large enough to enclose the fruit completely.      Then cream together the butter and sugar. Into each apple      put a tablespoon of the butter mixture, followed by an      equal amount of marmalade, then almonds, and finally,      another tablespoon of the butter-sugar mix. Wrap each apple      tightly with the foil and set aside.    </p>    <p>      Spread the bran flakes (or bread crumbs) evenly on a dinner      plate. Beat the egg lightly with 1-1/2 tablespoons of the      milk and pour the mixture onto a second platter. Trim any      excess fat from the pork chops, add salt and pepper, and      press them firmly into the bran flakes to coat both sides      and the edges. Cover them similarly with the egg-milk      mixture, then again with the bran until they have a thick      crust. (If the egg needs thinning, add the remaining milk.)    </p>    <p>      Heat the pressure cooker (without its base rack) to      medium-high frying temperature, add three tablespoons of      butter and-when it's hot-quickly sauce the pork chops until      they're nicely browned. Then carefully lift out the meat,      add the remaining butter to the pot, and lightly brown the      potato slices and carrots, seasoning with salt and pepper      to taste. When they're done, turn off the heat, spread the      vegetables in an even layer on the bottom of the cooker,      pour the wine over them and place the pork chops on top.      Position the base rack on the meat. Put the cauliflowerets      (seasoned lightly) into a small, open dish, sprinkle on      half the grated cheese, and place the dish in the pot. Put      the four figs directly on the base rack, add the apples      (right side up), and fasten the lid on the cooker. Bring      the pressure up to 15 pounds and cook for exactly five      minutes.    </p>    <p>      When the time's up, remove the pot from the heat and reduce      the pressure immediately. Unwrap the apples, dribble a      tablespoon of maple syrup over each one, and let them cool      until you're ready for dessert. Serve up the pork chops      with the potatoes, carrots, figs, and cheesed cauliflower.      Then scrape the bottom of the cooker to incorporate the      brown drippings into the natural wine sauce, and spoon the      liquid over the meat. Finish up with a sprinkle of grated      cheese over the entire main dish.    </p>    <p>      SAUTEED, POACHED CHICKEN WITH<br />      BROCCOLI, CARROTS, AND STEAM-BAKED PEARS<br />      Dessert Pears<br />      2 ripe pears<br />      1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br />      3 dates, pitted and chopped<br />      6 walnut halves, coarsely chopped<br />      2 tablespoons flaked coconut<br />      2 tablespoons pure maple syrup<br />    </p>    <p>      Main Dish    </p>    <p>      2 servings frying chicken (breasts, drumsticks or thighs) 2      tablespoons all purpose flour 2 tablespoons paprika salt to      taste ' freshly ground black pepper to taste broccoli      flowerets for 2 servings 4 medium carrots, scraped 2      tablespoons corn or peanut oil 1/2 cup dry white wine Cut      the pears in halves lengthwise and scoop out their cores      and strings. Rub the cut surfaces at once with lemon juice      to prevent the flesh from darkening. Combine the chopped      dates and walnuts with the coconut, then lightly pack this      mixture into the hollows and stem channels of the pear      halves. Wrap each pear section tightly (cut side up) in      aluminum foil and set aside Mix and spread the flour and      paprika on a plate. Pat the chicken with salt and pepper      and roll it in the flour mixture.    </p>    <p>      Leave the broccoli flowerets in whole stalks, trimming only      the tough bottom end and slashing the remaining stem into      quarters. Cut any tough root ends from the scraped carrots.    </p>    <p>      Heat the pressure cooker to medium-high frying temperature,      add the oil, and-when it's hot-quickly sauce the chicken to      a golden brown. Turn off the heat and add the wine. Place      the cooking rack in the pot-resting on the chicken-and      carefully set the broccoli, carrots, and pears on top.      Fasten the lid, bring the pressure to 15 pounds, and cook      for five minutes.    </p>    <p>      When the cooking is completed, remove the pot from the      heat, reduce the pressure at once, and serve the chicken      and vegetables. Leave the pear packages to cool until      you're ready to serve the dessert. Then open them and      dribble half a tablespoon of the maple syrup over each pear      half.    </p>    <hr />
