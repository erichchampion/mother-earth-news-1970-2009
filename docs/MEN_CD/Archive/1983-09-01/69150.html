            		             <h5 id="byline">      by D.J. Young    </h5>    <p>      Knowing a few little "tricks of the trade" can make      gardening-which is <em>always</em> a satisfying      experience-a total joy. Occasionally, these      timesaving, moneysaving, or just plain energy-con serving      tips can be found in horticulture books and magazines, but      more often they're passed along by oldtimers who've been      digging in the good earth for decades. It was such a man as      this who taught me the "cabbage magic" trick.<br />      <br />      "You can grow more than one head of cabbage per plant, you      know," he remarked one day. I didn't really      <em>believe</em> him (who would?), but I tried his method      anyway ... and it worked! Anyone can do it, and the      technique should be especially helpful if your growing      season is too short for producing two crops (in spring and      fall).</p>      <h3>LEAVE A LITTLE TO GROW ON</h3>      <p>      The procedure is easy: When you harvest the main cabbage      head (probably at about this time of year), just leave      enough bottom leaves to constitute a viable plant (see the      photograph). If you cut <em>below</em> the lowest leaves,      the stubble will wither quickly and die ... and you want it      to live long enough to be the sprouting surface for a      second crop. Now, make believe what's left is a whole new      plant. Treat it like one, cultivating it, watering it, and      even working some rich manure into the first inch of soil      (being careful not to injure the roots).<br />      <br />      Before long, you'll see some small sprouts forming around      the rim of the main head's stub. Keep on treating the plant      like a new one, and in time these little "sub-heads" will      grow to the size of a fist. There will probably be several      of the shoots-perhaps as many as six-and, in total, they'll      provide almost as much food value as the big main head did      ... but with a delightful difference. The cores of these      little cabbages will be pale green-almost      white-leafy, and tender. The outer leaves will be darker      green, but <em>still</em> tender and tasty. They're all, in      fact, simply delicious!<br />      <br />      The small size and fine quality of the minicoles make them      especially suitable for Chinese stir-fry, delicate      steaming, or soups and stews. (Since you'll be harvesting      them in the late fall when the first chill winds are      blowing, the savory leaves are particularly appropriate for      soup.)<br />      <br />      This bit of cabbage magic isn't difficult to perform ...      but it can increase your <em>Brassica</em> yield      dramatically, and <em>that</em> should make it a very      worthy addition to your private collection of garden      know-hows!    </p>

At harvest time, cut the main head just above the bottom leaves, as shown. The stub and leaves that remain will provide a sprouting surface for new, young plants. MIDDLE. Here a cluster of ""subheads"" has sprung up from the stubble of the main head Note that the original bottom leaves have completely died off and withered away. RIGHT. The cluster was separated into six (count 'em!) tasty fist-sized heads. Each has a tender, leafy white core and flavorful outer leaves.
