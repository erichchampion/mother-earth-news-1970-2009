        <p>Moths are no respecters of woolen clothing, no matter how special, expensive, <em>or</em> dear to your heart the garment might be! The night fliers aren't the only culprits, either: Rips, stains, and snags can mar the best-cared-for cardigan. Whatever the mishap, though, it's almost impossible to locate matching yarn in order to repair the damage, and many a fine old woolen knit has been relegated to the rubbish as a result.<br /><br />Well, it doesn't have to be that way. Stains and holes need not mean the end of your sweater ... indeed, a moth's meal can be the start of a new life for your beloved woolen.<br /><br />First of all, don't even try to find perfectly matching yarn. Instead, look for a selection of colorful two- or three-ply hanks of twist (a friend or relative who knits or crochets is an ideal source for these scraps). Next, get yourself a pair of sharp scissors and a tapestry needle with a large eye. Then sit down with your tools, the multicolored yarns, and your old sweater ... and get ready for a good time!<br /><br />Begin by patching the hole or stain with one strand of yarn. Go right over the fault, catching or covering the edges with yarn, making a little "button" of color. Now, put a few petals around the little patch (the "lazy daisy" embroidery stitch works well here) ... and there you have it! A flower! You can mend a whole sweater with daisies ... or let your imagination go wild, and embroider fish, fowl, and a veritable Noah's Ark of creatures. Furthermore, there's no need to <em>limit</em> your efforts to depicting flora and fauna: Sailboats, cars, buildings, or office supplies can all be worked into attractive thematic patterns. Then again, if you prefer <em>abstract</em> decorations, simply cover the offending spots with squares or rectangles, using various colors for the patches. Sometimes the yarns themselves will suggest designs.<br /><br />Who knows ... you might even end up looking at those moths as <em>allies!</em></p><hr /><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE.
