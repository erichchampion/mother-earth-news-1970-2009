        <h5>Issue # 83 - September/October 1983</h5><p>No doubt about it, the spring of 1983 won't go down as one of the better periods for the nuclear power industry in the United States . Indeed, a series of events has the entire enterprise reeling, and some observers believe its days are numbered. (This assumes, of course, that the federal government won't attempt to rescue the industry through subsidies . . . but that's another story. Left to its own free-market devices, the commercial reactor business appears to be close to breathing its last.) Among the body blows dealt in the past few months were the following:</p><p><strong>WPPSS (Washington Public Power Supply System, sometimes called "Whoops").</strong> A decade ago, a group of Pacific Northwest utilities determined that the low-cost power provided by their hydroelectric facilities wouldn't be enough to "fuel" the enormous growth projected for their service area, so they decided to build five large nuclear power plants. The rest of the story reads like a Greek tragedy: With demand far below projections, plans for two of the projects have been canceled ... two more plants, although partially completed, are also likely to be written off without ever operating ... and just one, now five years behind schedule, is expected to be fired up this winter. The upshot of all this is that a massive financial obligation- involving several billion dollars in bonds and billions more in interest on those notes-must be met somehow. For a long time, it was assumed that the Northwest utilities, which had sold the bonds in the first place (and were expected to make the money back by selling all that nuclear electricity), would have to pony up the loot. But now, several courts have ruled that the utilities <em>aren't</em> responsible for the debts, and WPPSS's has taken its only recourse, which is simply to declare the largest bond default in the history of this republic!</p><p><strong>California Laws.</strong> Economics also played a part in the most important nuclear <em>legal</em> decision in years. In 1976, it seems, antinuclear activists in the Golden State persuaded their legislature to pass three laws aimed at curtailing the growth of nuclear power in the state. Knowing that the Atomic Energy Act awards all authority over the "atomic" part of the nuclear business to the federal government, the Californians cast their laws as land-use and economic statutes. At long last, two of the laws have been upheld by the Supreme Court in a stunning unanimous decision. The laws say that, for economic reasons, a state has the power to <em>forbid</em> the construction of nuclear power plants within its borders until the nuclear-waste and fuel-reprocessing problems are solved. Jim Harding, Friends of the Earth's energy expert, called the decision "a platinum pen" for signing the nuclear power program's death warrant.</p><p>Salem. Meanwhile, the season saw some near misses ... one being a malfunction at the Salem reactor in Massachusetts, which came as close to catastrophe as anything since Three Mile Island.</p><p>The problem was what the industry calls, in its private, arcane jargon, an "anticipated transient without scram". In plain English, this means that the control rods-which, when inserted, can stop the heat-producing reaction in a power plant's core-stuck (failed to "scram"), very nearly leading to a disastrous accident ("transient"). In fact, expert observers told the FOE journal <em>Not Man Apart</em> that if an alert operator (a flesh-and-blood human being) hadn't noticed that the gauges weren't relaying good news and hadn't acted within one minute, Salem could have had the first full-scale meltdown in nuclear history. The reason for the near miss? Routine maintenance required by the manufacturer of a certain set of parts hadn't been carried out for-count <em>'em</em> - <em>eight years!</em></p><h3>CARVING UP ANTARCTICA</h3><p>Robert Waldrop, former Sierra Club assistant representative in Washington, D.C., came up with a wonderful one-liner: "Alaska is the last chance to do it right the first time." Antarctica needs an equally good one-liner and an enormous amount of help from conservationists ... since the environment of the fifth largest continent is far more vulnerable than that of the 49th state, and the people who are aware of its delicacy are pitifully few.</p><p>As it stands, 14 industrial nations have declared themselves the "guardians" of Antarcticaalong with its animal and mineral wealth-and have been conspiring lately to begin the dismemberment of the coldest continent. Why should we be concerned? For one thing, Antarctica is one of the world's largest scientific laboratories. Cores from its thick, icy crust have provided extraordinary clues about the earth's history ... and about the latter-day cluttering of it. In addition, the continent's edges and seas are critical habitats for whales, seals, penguins, and albatross. The threats are clear: exploitation of shrimplike crustaceans called krill (which are essential food for whales) and the mad dash for minerals and oil. The big 14the Antarctica Treaty nations-are even now working out details of new agreements to govern the mining, drilling, and krilling that may commence soon. The "Cold Rush" is on because of the treasures Antarctica is thought to contain , . . and because some of the world's 150-odd countries that <em>don't</em> belong to the treaty group are beginning to ask for a share of the wealth. Meanwhile, the treaty powers proceed as if they have a God-given right to determine the fate of a continent: They won't even allow nonmember nations, environmental organizations, or the press to attend their meetings!</p><h3>CALIFORNIA INDIANS WIN ONE</h3><p>In a surprising decision, a federal court in California has ruled that the Forest Service cannot complete the last few miles of a logging road because it would cross a site sacred to the Karok, Yurok, and Tolowa Indians. Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, were coplaintiffs in the case.</p><p>The road would have connected the towns of Gasquet and Orleans in the Siskiyou Mountains in the far north of California. Between those burgs lies a stretch of forest that contains more species of coniferous trees than any other this side of the Himalayas. What's more, this complex old-growth forest is a last refuge for the wolverine ... and it contains prime spawning grounds for salmon, steelhead, and the rare summer steelhead in its clear, gravelbottomed streams. The Forest Service and local logging companies wanted to finish the road to provide access to valuable timber, but-for the first timea judge ruled that Indian religion took precedence over economic necessity in a resource decision.</p><h3>FAREWELL, GOOD FRIENDS</h3><p>The past months have been sad ones ... marked with the deaths of three environmental giants:</p><p>Tom McCall, governor of Oregon for two terms in the 1970's, pioneered legislation requiring deposits on beverage cans and bottles, stimulated far-reaching land-use controls) and hit the national spotlight with a publicity campaign that said, "Please come visit Oregon ... but don't stay!" Tom lost a battle with cancer, but not before he had successfully defended his land-use law against repeal last fall.</p><p>Wilson Clark, an energy specialist who began his career at Friends of the Earth, went on to become principal energy adviser to California Governor Jerry Brown (the first antinuclear politician of national renown). Wilson died when his car went off the road as he swerved to avoid hitting a deer.</p><p>Phillip Burton, Congressman from San Francisco, can rightfully be credited with saving more acres of parks and wilderness than any other member of Congress. He was author of the Redwood National Park bill, the Omnibus Parks bill of the late 1970's (a law that added acreage to nearly every park in the system), the Golden Gate National Recreation Area bill, and hundreds of others.</p><p>All three men will be sorely missed ... and all leave a legacy to be proud of.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to become a member of the worldwide organization Friends</em> of <em>the Earth, and/or receive their excellent paper</em> Not Man Apart, fill <em>out the coupon below and mail it with your check to: Friends of the Earth, Dept.
