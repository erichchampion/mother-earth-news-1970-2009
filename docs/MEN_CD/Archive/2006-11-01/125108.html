        Here's your chance to take one small step that will help protectthe environment, save energy and save money. The<a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=cal.showPledge" target="_blank">Change A Light, Change The World</a> campaign   encourages Americans to replace a conventional bulb or fixture   in the home or workplace with a compact fluorescent light (CFL)   bulb that has earned the government's Energy Star label for   energy efficiency.<br /><br />If every American home changed just five of its most-used lightfixtures to Energy Star bulbs, each family would save about $60every year in energy costs ? and together we'd save about $6.5billion each year in energy costs and prevent greenhouse-gasemissions equivalent to those from more than 8 million cars.<br /><br />Energy Star qualified bulbs and fixtures use one-third the energyof traditional models, last up to 10 times longer and reduceutility costs. In fact, consumers can save up to $30 in utilitycosts over the lifetime of one bulb. And the less energy we use,the less energy electric utilities must generate, and less demandmeans fewer greenhouse gas emissions.<br /><br />These bulbs are readily available at home improvement stores,discount stores and many other retail outlets. And current bulbsare much brighter, easier on the eyes and less expensive thanprevious versions of the CFL.<br /><br />The 'Change a Light, Change the World' campaign is an annual effortby the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department ofEnergy, and this year, the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment joined the campaign to extend its reach. It started inearly October and runs through November.<br /><br />Make your own commitment to change the world today! Just take the<a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=cal.showPledge" target="_blank">Energy Star Change a Light Pledge</a> to replace   any number of standard lightbulbs. You also can sign up to   receive energy-saving tips quarterly from Energy Star.   Individuals who pledged during last year's campaign will prevent   greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to nearly 3,000 vehicles and   save $2 million in energy costs.   <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=lighting.pr_lighting" target="_blank">Learn more</a> about Energy Star light bulbs and   fixtures.<br /><br /><br />
