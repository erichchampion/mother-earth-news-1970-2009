        As the fall hunting season progresses, it's important to be awareof chronic wasting disease (CWD), a type of spongiformencephalopathy similar to mad cow disease, that afflicts deer andelk in North America.<br /><br />Though there are no confirmed cases of animal-to-human infection,the disease may take several years to surface, so the Center forDisease Control recommends that everyone follow theseguidelines:<br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Avoid eating meat from deer and elk that look sick or testpositive for CWD.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>If you harvest deer or elk from areas known to be CWD positive,consider having the animals tested before consuming them. Moststate wildlife agencies have information about testingservices.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><br />While scientists don't know for sure how this degenerativeneurological illness is transmitted, evidence suggests the diseaseis spread through direct animal-to-animal contact, or throughcontaminated feed and water sources.<br /><br />CWD was first identified in captive mule deer during the late 1960sin Colorado, and in wild populations by 1981. In the mid-'90s, CWDwas found among free-ranging deer and elk in northeastern Coloradoand southeastern Wyoming, where the disease is now endemic.<br /><br />Cases of CWD have been reported in the following 11 states:Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Illinois,New Mexico, New York, Wisconsin and West Virginia.<br /><br />For more information, including specific recommendations on fielddressing deer and elk, visit the<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/cwd/" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control</a> site, or the<a href="http://www.cwd-info.org/index.php" target="_blank">ChronicWasting Disease Alliance</a>.<br />
