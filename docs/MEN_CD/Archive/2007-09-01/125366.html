        <p>When it comes to backyard or pathway lights, forget practicaland boring ? think fun and fancy. You can create a soothing,inviting mood with unique and attractive outdoor lighting.</p><br /><p>Better yet, you can use solar powered outdoor lights, to saveenergy and save yourself digging ditches, laying the wire andattaching it to a junction box. When choosing an outdoor solarpowered light you will need to consider a variety of factors inorder to match the function you want with the available lightingchoices.</p><br /><p>Solar lights use small photovoltaic cells that absorb sunlightduring the day and turn it into energy. Rechargeable batteriesstore the energy, making it available at night when it is needed.<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Alternative-Energy/2007-04-01/Bright-Ideas-for-Home-Lighting.aspx" target="_blank">LED</a> (light emitting diode) bulbs, which require little powerand last 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs, provide theillumination. There is no wiring necessary to connect the lights toeach other or to the electric grid.</p><br /><p>For starters, there are three kinds of garden solar lights:</p><br /><p><strong>Path lights</strong>: solar powered path lights come ina variety of fairly standard styles from modern to classic. Theycan be hung from a pole or embedded in the ground to light a darkwalk or guide the way. And because there is no wiring involved,they can easily be moved to a new location whenever the remodelingbug hits you.</p><br /><p><strong>Decorative accent lights</strong>: For more fun andfancy, check out the solar powered garden lights that glow withattractive designs and colors. Position them right and it will belike having a giant-size firefly in your yard. These unique lights,made of blown glass or hand-made materials, will add a touch ofwhimsy to your yard, when placed in and around your shrubs andflower beds. You can find these lights online or in homeimprovement stores and garden centers. Most have the glowing lightperched on top of a slim stake that can easily be pushed into thesoil. The small solar collector is attached to the stake and<em>must receive direct sunlight each day</em> in order to chargethe batteries.</p><br /><p><strong>Spot lights</strong>: For focused lighting, there arespotlights that can be tucked into the garden foliage illuminatinga unique landscape feature. The one we tested from Gaiam has a cordattached to the small solar panel, which is placed in directsunlight, up to 8 feet away from the lights. On some solarspotlights, the solar panel is attached to the spotlight head,which must have direct sunlight to recharge the batteries.</p><br /><p>Here are some companies that carry a variety of solar gardenlights.<br /><a href="http://www.gaiam.com/" target="_blank">www.gaiam.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank">www.homedepot.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.snappdragon.com/" target="_blank">www.snappdragon.com</a></p><br />
