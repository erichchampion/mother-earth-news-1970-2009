        <p>My wife, two-year-old child and I presently live in a 22-foot, chassis mounted, channeled-through motor home on a one-ton Ford truck. We've been in this rig for the last eight months. Before that we lived in a 21-foot trailer for a year.</p><p>I am able to earn an above-average living in the Chicago area in the summer by plying my trade of paperhanging. I have been able to do as well in the winter in Miami, Florida. Being able to make contacts in this field as an independent contractor, I could-if others were interested-provide a means of making money for a caravan. I know the market in this trade and feel that if three to five men were to form a contracting-decorating service to work in the larger urban areas it would take-at most-two months to fill the next egg for the families involved. I am not well versed in forage living but, if I were more knowledgeable in that field, I am sure that less "out- side" income would be needed.</p><p>We have traveled the middle west, southwest, south and east coast and-to our amazement-we've only been told to move on twice in two years. This is most surprising for we are quite longhaired and I have a beard. I am sure, due to the ever-growing alertness of our nation's paranoids, that this sort of luck can't last for long.</p><p>We are neither far left nor right. We won't be a part of anything where guns do the talking, and today they talk from both sides. The thing for us to do, I guess, is stay out of the way-if that's possible-and let the guns take care of each other.</p>
