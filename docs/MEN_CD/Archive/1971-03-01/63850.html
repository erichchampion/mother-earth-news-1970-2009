                    <h5 id="byline">      by STEPHEN KOVAKA    </h5>        <p>      A small step-in van, I believe, is just about the handiest      vehicle there is. We've had ours for nearly two years      and-in that time-it has probably paid for      itself (I'll tell you how to arrange that), been our      transportation and home-away-from-home, provided rides for      thousands of hitchhikers and given us more fun than three      Volkswagens.    </p>    <p>      The best places I know of to get one of these trucks are      (1) the Post Office and (2) bakeries, milk companies and      other businesses that keep a fleet of delivery vans. Our      pride and joy is a '61 Dodge one-ton mail truck (Dodge      makes really good trucks) and, since everyone we pick up      wants to know how we got it, here's the details.    </p>    <p>      The General Services Administration is the U.S. Government      agency that actually sells old mail vans. The trucks are      sold at a <em>closed bid auction .</em> This means that all      bids are submitted in writing by a certain <em>due date      .</em> The bids are then opened by the GSA and the highest      price offered on each vehicle wins.    </p>    <p>      Mail truck auctions take place several times a year at      different P.O. garages, depending on which ones have a      supply of overage vehicles. Your first step, then, is to      find out when and where the vans are being sold. Write or      call the GSA for this information. The agency's local      number and address is in most large city and state capitol      phone books under "U.S. Government." Ask to be notified of      mail truck auctions in your area and GSA will send you a      list of vehicles being sold at each garage that has them.      This list will give the year, manufacturer, mileage and      condition of each truck and will usually list one-quarter,      three-quarter and one-ton vans.    </p>    <p>      Now take someone who knows about cars and trucks (if you      do, so much the better) to a garage that has the kind of      van you want. The person in charge there will give you keys      to the ones in which you're interested and you can then      drive the vehicles around the lot to get an idea of the      shape they're in.    </p>    <p>      Be particularly observant of the transmission in an      automatic shift truck. This is one of the worst things to      fix yourself and it's expensive to have repaired. I think a      standard shift-if you can get one-will present      far fewer maintenance problems, be more fun to drive and      give you greater control of the van.    </p>    <p>      When you find a truck that makes you happy, fill out and      send in your bid sheet (this should have come with the      auction notice) to GSA. Remember that the price of one of      these trucks can be really low but also remember that your      bid must be the highest for the particular truck you want      or you won't get it.    </p>    <p>      The cheapest truck I know about went for $75. Ours cost      $250 and that's about the highest I've heard of . . . but,      at that, we outbid a P.O. garage mechanic by only $25. (He      had told us the van was one of the best in the lot so don't      be afraid to ask the mechanics for tips on bidding and the      condition of a truck . . . they may or may not be of help.)    </p>    <p>      You'll be competing against others who are looking for a      good truck and you may find it wise to bid on an      otherwisesound vehicle with a bad tire, cracked radiator,      broken alternator or other relatively minor but readily      apparent fault that will discourage heavy bidding. Then,      when you come to pick up the van, you can bring along the      replacement part and bolt it on.    </p>    <p>      You might also consider bidding on two or three vehicles,      just to make sure you get one. If you win on all three      bids, though, you'll have to buy all three trucks. Of      course, many of a van's body (not engine-they're      pretty standard) parts are hard to come by and you might      want a second vehicle just for spares. If you have a place      to keep it, that will be approximately $75-$150 for just      about all the parts you'll ever need which is a good deal!      Or, you could resell the extra truck formaybe-enough      to pay for all the ones you bought.    </p>    <p>      Suppose now that you've sent in a bid and received      notification that you've won. You've mailed or delivered      the bid price to GSA and they've given you a certificate of      ownership which you must take to the garage when you go to      pick up your truck. You'll also need to take along some      license plates so you can drive your new toy home.    </p>    <p>      Many states issue inexpensive temporary plates for just      such occasions but you may prefer to halve this particular      bit of red tape by purchasing the current yearly license      the first time around. When you register your truck, try to      license it as a camper (passenger vehicle). This is cheaper      than truck registration although insurance might cost less      if the rig is wearing truck plates.    </p>    <p>      At this point I would like to offer some advice: Your truck      will probably have logged 50-90 thousand miles of short      distance driving when you get it. This means you can expect      to have some major and/or minor repair work ahead of you .      . . maybe not immediately, but sooner or later. If you're      forced to take the vehicle to a repair shop you may end up      paying as much as you would have for a late model van from      a regular dealer . . . plus, your transportation will      always be in the garage and not on the road.    </p>    <p>      I speak from experience. Three thousand miles after I got      my truck I somehow cracked a piston and decided to have the      whole engine rebuilt by a "good" mechanic. He did a lot of      work for the $500 he charged me but the job took him over a      month and he put the rocker arm assembly back together      wrong. This warped a valve and caused undue rocker arm and      valve stem wear as I later learned when I had to do a valve      job in the middle of a trip to western Canada.    </p>    <p>      There is a solution to this problem, though, and along      about the time I was writing the mechanic his check I hit      upon it: Learn to fix mail trucks!    </p>    <p>      For this you'll need about fifty dollars worth of tools and      a <em>Motor's</em> repair manual. This is the handbook that      regular mechanics use and there are two editions, one for      cars and one for trucks.    </p>    <p>      The truck repair manual can only be purchased by      professional mechanics. The car manual, however, is      available in bookstores and libraries and-since cars      and small trucks are nearly the same mechanically-you      can probably use the car manual perfectly well for your      van.    </p>    <p>      There's another way to get a copy of the Motor's repair      manual. This handbook is published annually for vehicles of      the current year and those of 6-8 years past. For each      edition, the publisher adds the latest model and drops the      oldest. Thus the manuals overlap considerably and you may      be able to get a mechanic to part with one of his      superfluous back issues.    </p>    <p>      Then again, basic engine design doesn't change that much in      most cases and you may be able to do as I did: use a new      manual for an old truck. Just be sure the handbook is a      Motor's repair manual. This is <em>the best</em> repair      guide I've seen with loads of diagrams, actual photos of      <em>your</em> engine, specifications and instructions on      how to do most jobs on each make of car and a whole long      section on trouble shooting and figuring out what's wrong      in the first place.    </p>    <p>      A lot of people have converted used vans into perfect      luxury vehicles with wood paneling, beds, gas stoves,      stereos, etc. That's fine for long trips if you don't like      to camp out but it definitely limits the use you can make      of your truck. We designed our van for maximum utility by      giving it a quick-change interior.    </p>    <p>      Along one wall I've built a tool box (you always break down      when you're going somewhere), a storage chest that fits      over the wheel well and a food box. One half of the food      box is insulated with fiberglass house insulation and will      keep perishables cold for two days on 50 cents worth of ice      (it also provides us with icewater). On top of the three      chests are two foam rubber couch cushions that make the      whole thing into a bed or seat. The important point here is      that the complete assembly can be removed in ten minutes.      This leaves the interior of the van free for moving      furniture.    </p>    <p>      If you don't mind the work, light hauling is one of the      best, most foolproof, part-time jobs there is. Starting      such a business is a snap. Simply run an ad in your local      paper that says,    </p>    <p>      Furniture, what have you moved cheaply and quickly.<br />      We also clean out attics, garages and basements.    </p>    <p>      Then just sit back and wait for the calls to come in . . .      And there will be a lot of calls.    </p>    <p>      You can move the average apartment full of furniture and      gear in one to five hours and charge $20-$70. Thirty      dollars is about average. Allow yourself and your friend      (you'll need help) about $4-$5/hr. each. It's hard work.      Add on a little to pay for truck upkeep . . . and you'll      have your rates. If there's a refrigerator or range to      move, tack on another $3.00 and rent a dolly from U-Haul.    </p>    <p>      My brother and I have made as much as $800 in three weeks      during peak moving season and we were so busy we had to      turn people away. You'll meet a lot of good folks this way      and it's really enjoyable work that you can arrange to suit      your own hours. This is a good deal for your customers too      because you're charging only about half of Mayflower's      rates . . . if they'd even do the job.    </p>    <p>      You'll find that cleaning garages and attics can be an      especially good part of your business. People throw away      all kinds of good stuff and-this way-you get      first pick before it goes to the dump.    </p>    <p>      Hauling electric bands and their gear to and from jobs is      another job possibility. You'll usually get into the dance      or concert free in addition to getting paid.    </p>    <p>      You'll find millions of other uses for your truck: Alley      picking, hauling building materials, bringing in wholesale      produce for food co-ops, picking up <em>every</em>      hitchhiker you see and distributing underground papers      (another paying job if any are published in your area). You      can haul your homegrown vegetables into the nearest city      and sell them from the back of the truck, make the van into      a lunch wagon . . . or just take <em>everyone</em> you know      to the beach.    </p>
