        <p>Generally speaking, there are two ways to market cartoon-illustrated humor scripts: (1) You simply put the finished script plus illustrations into the envelope, add a self-addressed, stamped return envelope and promptly mail. (2) You write a letter, querying the editor about his possible interest in your humor piece, briefly describing it and its slant. .<br /><br />Although I have used both methods, I am inclined to believe the first method very often brings home the bacon since humor is almost impossible to adequately "describe" - and seeing the finished script sometimes overcomes any latent hesitation an editor might have if he had to visualize, imaginatively, a piece described.<br /><br />However, should you like to try the Query Method, here is the sort of letter I usually write:<br /><br /><em>Dear Mr.</em> -----:<br /><em>Would your book be interested in seeing, on spec, a 1,500 word</em> <em>humor piece, complete with three cartoon illustrations as a package deal?</em><em>Primarily, this piece is a lightly handled account of (and describe your subject, matter, theme and conclusion) which I think might very well offer your book editorial change-of-pace and entertainment for your readers.</em><em>Sincerely yours,</em> Be sure you enclose a self-addressed, stamped reply business envelope. Be damned sure you include the words, <em>"package deal".</em> These are <em>magic</em> words to editors of small magazines.<br /><br />When I use the direct submission method, I <em>always</em> enclose a brief note to the editor along with the finished properties. It usually goes something like this:<br /><br /><em>Dear Mr.------:<br /></em><br /><em>The enclosed humor piece and accompanying cartoon illustrations are offered as a package deal. I hope it lands on target.</em> <em>Sincerely yours,</em> Right about here, I want to emphatically disagree with those who have referred to the humor piece as "easy money". It's not. If anything, a well slanted, carefully planned and written script-running from 1,000 to 2,000 words - requires a lot more thinking and labor than several batches of cartoons. And should earn as much, if not a hell of a lot more for you, than several batches of cartoons.<br /><br />You set your own standard of expectations, of course . . . but you're batty if you accept less than what slanted humor copy complete with cartoon illustration, package-deal, is actually worth. Such packages are not often seen - especially in the smaller editorial offices. Don't let existing cartoon or copy rates influence <em>your</em> rates. At the same time, don't get too unrealistic in your rates.<br /><br />And what is good humor/illustration worth? Well, not <em>less</em> than $50.00 for 1,000 words plus two illustrations. <em>About</em> $75.00 for 1,500 words plus two or three illustrations. <em>(Scale that up 50-100% for 1970-Ed. )</em> Naturally, take as much as you can get. Good, well slanted humor is worth a decent price by virtue of its scarcity. As you progress (assuming you stay with it), you will be astounded to find $5.00 cartoon markets gladly shelling out $80.00 to $200.00 for 1,500 to 2,000 word humor scripts with two to four illustrations . . . PROVIDING you have given the book exactly what it needs in slant plus a lot more in offbeat feature material.<br /><br />Recently, an IG contributor suggested that a writer send his script to the illustrator working with him for added evaluation on rewrite. This is sheer nonsense and a waste of time.<br /><br />Most cartoonists don't know beans about writing. If the gagwriter knows his end of the business and has produced a salable script, the cartoonist will be doing his job if he confines his attention to producing equally good illustrations to accompany the script. I'm <em>not</em> saying cartoonists cannot learn to write. <em>Many</em> can. But I am assuming the only writer/cartoonists teams will be those comprised of gagwriters who cannot draw and cartoonists who cannot write. Why add confusion to the collaboration?<br /><br />If you <em>are</em> a cartoonist who can write, then you have no business hitching up your checks with a gagwriter. In fact, editors seem to possess a <em>special preference</em> for a cartoonist who can write <em>and</em> illustrate. Anyway, that's been my experience.<br /><br />Hardly a month goes by without additional illustration assignments coming my way from editors who have purchased humor copy sans illustration. And, for the most part, they <em>prefer</em> a package deal from one guy if possible. The only way a gagwriter can combat this is to learn how to turn out such superior humor copy that he is literally <em>outwriting</em> his competitors.<br /><br />I'll make it plain - right here - that I consider a 50/50 sharing of a check from a humor piece sale to be utterly stupid. If anything, it should be 70/30 with the <em>writer</em> getting the bigger percentage. It requires a hell of a lot more skill to turn out salable wordage than it does to illustrate that wordage.<br /><br />There are <em>many</em> magazines that will take a script and illustrations, monthly, if they are written in the First Person with a fictional treatment built around an imaginary character in keeping with the book's subject matter. Thus, if you turn out regular pieces using the ficticious name of Pete McPipewrench, there's a splendid chance that the ASSOCIATED PLUMBERS' NEWSBLATT will buy them all year long and love you for producing them. A final word on the matter: Keep the copy clean and with wide margins. Keep all illustrations drawn on the Vertical unless an editor specifies otherwise</p><p>. . . . .Carl Kohler<br /></p>
