                    <p>      You cannot possibly realize how courageous I'm being by      simply writing for this Journal Of The Talented. Everytime      I whomp up something for these pages, mail starts flooding      my mailbox . . . all of it telling me what a dolt and      laggard and poseur I am. Naturally, I'm learning      Caution.<br />      <br />      However . . . all this talk about not doing cartoons for      <em>less</em> than $10 was just too much for me. I've tried      and tried hard (it wasn't easy) to ignore it, but I've      succumbed at last and must laugh right in your face.<br />      <br />      And <em>why</em> am I presuming to be so rude?<br />      <br />      Because - as of this morning - I turned out 20 cartoons      that will sell for $5 each. It took me all morning to draw      them. Kinda crazy, eh? Spending an entire morning earning a      lousy $100?<br />      <br />      Furthermore (and get this now), <em>the editor wrote the      gags.</em> Pretty stupid setup, eh? What's more, I've got      about five such editors - all of them editing very      specialized books that badly need at least 4 technical      cartoons a month, each - doing their own gag writing . . .      and assigning the artwork to me.<br />      <br />      It can't be done? Wanna bet cash on it? Hell, there are      <em>many</em> such editors who would be delighted to have a      cartoonist (one whose style they prefer, of course) do the      artwork on special gags. This is becoming a very      commonplace method, in freelance cartooning - just in case      you've been so busy spec-freelancing you've failed to hear      about it.<br />      <br />      Nobody in their right mind draws ex <em>cept</em> on      assignment anymore. That is, for 80% of their Bread and      Butter money. Naturally, everybody (I guess) still whomps      out a few to "Hopeful" markets . . . and they should. But      ignore all the assignment work in the middle and minor      books? Not me, frent. And you shouldn't either..    </p>    <p>      But back again to this Brave Plan For Raising Rates. It may      work beautifully for some of you . . . at some books.      However, you can safely wager there will be many, many      books that will view such shenanigans with a cold eye. And      those are the books I plan to approach (by mass query) with      the notion of do ing their cartoons on assignment if      they'll write the gags.<br />      <br />      Have you ever thought of working for $5 per, say, for a few      months and then, in a nice businesslike way, requesting a      modest rate raise to $7.50 . . . and several months after      that, to $10? Of course you haven't. You're a freelance      cartoonist, not a sane businessman! But it works - assuming      the editor really likes your work. And if he doesn't like      your work that much? Then you aren't building any future by      working for him in the first place.<br />      <br />      Editors are people. People do not take to change      (especially sudden change) very kindly. But work them up to      it, gradually, and you'll be astounded at the results. This      simple advice is not original. It's been written hundreds      of times by cartoonists much more gifted artistically than      I'll ever be . . . and whose shrewd business sense makes me      appear naive by comparison. And this simple (but sage)      advice <em>works.</em><br />      <br />      Years and years ago, Lew Card wrote: "You'll make more      money with your typewriter than you ever could with your      drawing board." He was 100000% correct. Trouble is, just      because he invented the typer-system of cartooning,      everybody naturally thought he was talking entirely about      typers - which he wasn't. Not entirely.<br />      <br />      He meant . . . queries, too.<br />      <br />      A query is such a nice, uncomplicated item. It only costs      6 cents to send and it saves you a whale of a lot of time      and labor . . . and often produces rather wonderful      results.<br />      <br />      Yet, sending out 200 to 1000 queries is damned hard work.      And (I'm inclined to believe) most cartoonists would prefer      to risk time drawing cartoons and risk postage by marketing      them on pure (or near pure) speculation. That insanity      seems to be a fairly uniform attribute of the cartooning      critter regardless of style or stage. This has given too      many editors the cruel upper hand, lo, these long      years.<br />      <br />      I have nothing against $10 sales. Like any other working      pro, I make a lot of them and I love them - if I can't get      more. But I like the $5 variety too - provided I don't have      to write a gag for it - and so should you on the same      premise.    </p>    <p>      For instance: Ever thought of combing the small, specialty      books with an offer to do a regular, monthly Feature      Character panel for them? Offering a Trade Character doing      hilarious things familiar to the guys in that particular      trade . . . and asking, say, $7.50 for such a spe cialized      item?<br />      <br />      Try it. It might surprise you how many editors would love      to have a feature they could count on coming in, with the      proper slant, every month. Eventually, you'll get $10 or      $15 for it. Multiply that by 20 or 30 editors and you can      tell the boss to go to hell while you retire home to      freelance fulltime.<br />      <br />      It's been done. I know several guys who are beginning to do      it, just that way, right now. But remember, write queries      (enclosing a sample of the particular character you have in      mind, which should vary with each magazine) first.    </p>    <p>      I better quit before I find I've written a full chapter on      the spec-less methods of selling cartoons.<br />      Goodbye, churls.    </p>    <p>      . . . . .
