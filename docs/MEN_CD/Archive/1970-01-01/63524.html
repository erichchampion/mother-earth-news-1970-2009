               <h1 id=" title">      DIGGER BREAD    </h1>    <p>      Every time we make this bread, it's a big hit around our      house. Have a big hit around your house. You will need two      coffee cans for two loaves. The same cans are used for      measuring and baking. It's a good idea to use the three      pound size for measuring and the one pound size for baking,      since the small tins bake most thoroughly without burning.    </p>    <p>      Do up the wet mix first:    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup lukewarm water (but not over 85 degrees, as the      yeast would be killed).<br />      1 cake or 2 packages of yeast (the cake works faster; if      the recipe is doubled or tripled this is still      enough).<br />      1 tablespoon of flour<br />      1 tablespoon of honey or raw sugar    </p>    <p>      Mix all of these in the can. If you wish, you may add a      couple spoonfuls of honey, molasses, brown sugar, or      dextros. A well-cooked potato put through a blender and      incorporated into the water at this stage can take the      place of the milk below.    </p>    <p>      Mix the dry ingredients while the wet mix stands:<br />      1 level can of whole wheat flour. Nasty old white flour      will never do!<br />      Rye flour must be mixed with other flour or gluten because      the loaf it makes is dense and does not rise well. Coarse      ground flours, like stone ground and meals, also must be      mixed with fine ground flour or gluten. (Note on gluten:      this is the substance that holds the dough together and      contains the yeast bubbles when the bread rises. It is      developed naturally by kneading.)    </p>    <p>      Add to taste any of the following:<br />      Salt - add a tablespoon or so.<br />      1 /8 can of powdered milk<br />      Handful or two of raisins<br />      Something weird, wheat germ, soya flour, food supplements,      nuts, dried dates, etc.    </p>    <p>      Mix the dry ingredients in a huge bowl or pan. Combine the      dry and wet mixes and blend until it is uniform. Toward the      end of this process such things as ripe bananas or sliced      peaches may be thrown in. Let the dough rise in a warm      place until it has risen by half. The top of a stove with      the oven on is about right. Sometimes this takes an hour or      two. Take this opportunity to grease the cans and light a      joint.    </p>    <p>      Kneading -<br />      Alter the dough has risen, sprinkle some flour on a counter      or a table top. Be sure to keep the flour on the kneading      surface, dough, and your hands! Turn the dough out on the      floured surface. Knead by pushing down the top and folding      the edges up onto the top again. Kneading usually takes      10-15 minutes. A well-kneaded dough is rounded and springs      like a plump baby's bottom.    </p>    <p>      "Why does a poor man make good bread?"    </p>    <p>      "Because he needs it a lot." Be sure all cans are well      greased. Divvy the dough, knead the halves into balls and      put into the cans. Let rise again until dough has almost      doubled in volume (about 45 minutes to an hour). Now you      may switch to the baking portion of this here recipe.    </p>    <p>      Baking -<br />      Put can upright in an oven preheated to 390 degrees, and      bake for one hour. The larger cans take longer to bake.      After baking, let the cans cool for 5 to 10 minutes. With      pot holder in hand, twirl bread in the can. It will glide      right on to the counter or whatever. Eat healthy!    </p>    <p>      <em>-from the HAIGHT-ASHBURY ST. LOVE</em>    </p>    <p>      CORRECTION: This classic recipe had passed through several      hands before I received it, and - somewhere along the way -      a portion of the liquid must certainly have been forgotten      by someone. Mike Renaud now bakes much of the bread around      here and - when he brews up a batch of the Digger article -      he substitutes 1-1/2 cups of water and a banana for the      one-half cup of water called out in the recipe. The bread,      so modified, is delicious. - MOTHER.    </p>
