                 		<p>      <em>This is the first draft of a work in progress by Gary      Snyder. It arose as a by-product of the Wild West debacle,      from the warmth of numerous meetings of ecological      activists working up to and out of a display at Wild West.      It's been arising in Gary Snyder for years. On August 17 he      submitted this draft for scrutiny by a group including      Cliff and Mary Humphrey, Keith Lampe, Sterling Bunnell,      Stephanie Mills, Joan McIntyre, Edward Bear, and others      whose names I didn't get. Gary ran the scrutiny session      with a light perceptive hand. The results you will see in      the final version soon to be printed throughout the      underground press.</em>			</p>      <h3>I. POPULATION</h3>			<p>      <strong>The Condition</strong><br />      <br />      Position: Man is but a part of the fabric of life -      dependent of course on the whole fabric for his very      existence, and also responsible to it. As the most highly      developed tool-using animal, he must recognize that the      evolutionary destinies (unknown) of other life forms are to      be respected, and act as gentle steward of the earth's      community of being.<br />      <br />      Situation: There are now too many human beings; and the      problem is growing rapidly worse. It is potentially      disastrous not only for the human race but for most other      life forms.<br />      <br />      Goal: The goal would be half of the present world      population or less.<br />      <br />      Action<br />      <br />      Social/political: Legalize abortion; encourage vasectomy      and sterilization (provided free by clinics), remove income      tax deductions for more than two children above a specified      income level, and scale it so that lower income families      are forced to be careful too. Take a vigorous stand against      the Catholic church and any other institutions that      exercise an irresponsible political force in regard to this      question; work ceaselessly to make all political problems      be seen and solved in the light of this prime problem.    </p>    <p>      The community: Explore other social structures and marriage      forms, such as group marriage and polyandrous marriage      which provide family life but which produce less children.      Share the pleasure of raising children widely, so that all      need not directly reproduce to enter into this basic human      experience. Let no two persons produce more than two      children. Adopt children. Let reverence for life and for      the feminine mean also a reverence for other species, most      of which are threatened.<br />      <br />      Our own heads: "I am a child of all life, and all living      beings are my brothers and sisters, my children and      grandchildren, & there is a child within me waiting to      be brought to birth, the baby of a new and wiser self."      Love, love-making, a male and female together, seen as the      vehicle of mutual realization, where the creation of new      selves and new worlds of beings is as important as making      babies.			</p>      <h3>II. POLLUTION</h3>			<p>      <strong>The Condition</strong><br />      <br />      Position: Pollution is an excess production of substances      which cannot be absorbed or transmuted rapidly enough to      offset their introduction, thus causing changes the cycle      is not prepared for. All organisms have wastes and      by-products, and these are indeed part of the total      ecosystem; energy is passedalong the line and refracted in      various ways, "the rainbow body." This is cycling, not      pollution.<br />      <br />      Situation: The human race in the last century has allowed      its production and dissemination of wastes, by-products and      various chemical substances to become excessive. Pollution      is directly harming the ecosystem. It is also ruining the      environment in very direct ways for humanity itself.<br />      <br />      Goal: Clean air, clean clear-running rivers, the Presence      of Pelicans and Ospreys in our lives, unrnuddied language      and good dreams.<br />      <br />      Action <em><br /></em><br />      Social/political: Waste and by-product quantity must be      reduced. Strong legislation controlling DDT and related      pesticides with no fooling around. Direct exposure of the      collusion of certain scientists, the pesticide industry,      and agri-business in trying to block this legislation.      Strong penalties for air and water pollution by industry.      "Pollution is somebody's profit." Phase out petroleum      fuels, explore all possible energy sources of a      non-polluting nature: solar power. Tell the truth regarding      atomic waste disposal and the threat it represents. Stop      all germ and chemical warfare research and experimentation.      Laws and sanctions encouraging the use of bio-degradable      substances; and sanctions against wasteful use of paper,      etc. which adds to the solid waste of cities. Determine      methods of re-cycling solid urban waste; and re-cycling as      a basic principle should inform all waste disposal      thinking.    </p>    <p>      The community: DDT and such: don't use them. Air pollution:      use less cars. Cars pollute the air, and one or two people      riding lonely in a huge car is an insult to intelligince      and the Muse. Share rides, pick up hitchhikers, legalize      hitch-hiking and build hitch-hiker waiting stations along      the highways. Also - as a step toward the new world - walk      more: look for the best routes through beautiful      countryside for long-distance walking trips: San Francisco      to Los Angeles down the Coast Range, for one. Learn how to      use your own manure as fertilizer if you're in the country      as the far East has done for centuries. There's a way, and      it's safe. †<br />      <br />      Solid waste: boycott wasteful Sunday papers which use up      trees, and add vastly to the solid waste of the city.      Refuse paper bags at the store. Organize park and street      cleanup festivals. Don't waste- (a monk and an old master      were once walking in the mountains. They noticed a little      hut upstream. The monk said, "A wise hermit must live there      - "The master said, "That's no wise hermit, you see that      lettuce leaf floating down the stream, he's a Waster." Just      then an old man came running down the hill with his beard      flying and caught the floating lettuce leaf.)<br />      <br />      Our own heads: Part of the trouble with talking about DDT      is that the use of it is not just a practical device, it's      almost an establishment religion. There is something in      western culture that wants to totally wipe out      creepy-crawlies and feels repugnance for toadstools and      snakes. This is fear of one's own deepest natural      inner-self wilderness areas, and the answer is, relax.      Relax around bugs, snakes arid your own hairy dreams. Again      farmers can and should share their crop with a certain      percentage of buglife as "paying their dues" - Thoreau says      "How then can the harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice also at      the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of      the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the      fields fill the farmer's barns. The true husbandman will      cease from anxiety as the squirrels manifest no concern      whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not, and      finish his labor with every day, relinquish all claim to      the produce of his fields, and sacrificing in his mind not      only his first but his last fruits also." In the realm of      thought, inner experience, consciousness, as in the outward      realm of interconnection, there is a difference between a      balanced cycle, and the excess which cannot be handled.      When the balance is right, the mind recycles from highest      illumination to the stillness of dreamless sleep; the      alchemical "transmutation."			</p>      <h3>III. CONSUMPTION</h3>			<p>      <strong>The Condition</strong><br />      <br />      Position: Consumption is also a matter of balances and the      problems that arise with excess. "The Wanton Boy that kills      a fly shall feel the Spider's enmity."<br />      <br />      Situation: Man's use of dozens of "resources" and his total      dependence on certain of them (like dependence on fossil      fuels) exhausts certain presences in the biosphere with      incalculable results on the other members of the network:      while rendering mankind vulnerable to the consequences of      the loss of major supplies. In fragile areas animals and      birds have all but been extincted in pursuit of furs or      feathers or fertilizer or oil: the soil is "used up" and      all of this to feed outrageous excesses like war, or a      phoney consumption-oriented economy.<br />      <br />      Goal: Balance, harmony, humility, the true affluence of      being a good member of the community of living      creatures.<br />      <br />      Action<br />      <br />      Social/political: Seek out new self-renewable energy      sources. And: it must be taught ceaselessly til it sticks      that a continually "growing economy" is no longer healthy,      but a Cancer. Restructure business corporations so that      they can function without presenting a contunually growing      profit; stress responsible, controlled production. Soil      banks, open space, phase out logging on federal land.      Protection for all predators and varmints. Absolutely no      further development of roads and concessions in National      Parks and Wilderness areas; build auto campgrounds in the      least desirable areas. Develop consumer-boycott and      consumer research power in the areas of irresponsible and      dishonest products. Thus: expose the myths of capitalism      and the cold war. & Communist myths of growth and      production by the by.<br />      <br />      The community: Sharing and conserving; boycotting the      wasteful. The inherent aptness of communal life, where      large tools are owned jointly, and personal objects are      private. If enough people refused to buy a new car for one      year, it would permanently alter the American economy.      Re-cycling clothes and equipment. (Goodwill and Salvation      Army are useful: they should perhaps be confronted and      straightened out on their pricing and wage policies.)      Support local handicrafts in shoes and clothes. Learn to      break the habit of too many unnecessary possessions - a      monkey on everybody's back - but avoid a self-abnegating      anti-joyous self righteousness. Simplicity is light,      carefree, neat, and loving-not a self-punishing ascetic      trip. (The greatest Chinese poet, Tu Fu, said, "The ideas      of a poet should be noble and simple.")<br />      <br />      Don't shoot a deer if you don't know how to use all the      meat and preserve that which you can't eat; to tan the hide      and use the leather - to use it all, with gratitude, right      down to the sinew and hooves. Simplicity and mindfulness in      diet is perhaps the starting point for most people.    </p>    <p>      Our own heads: It is hard to even begin to gauge how much a      complication of possessions, the habits of "ownership" and      "use" stand between us and a true, clear, liberated way of      seeing the world. To live lightly on the earth, to be aware      and alive, to be free of egotism, starts with concrete      acts, but the inner principle is the insight that we are      interdependent energy fields of great potential wisdom and      compassion - expressed in each person as a superb mind, a      beautiful and complex body, and the almost magical capacity      of language. To these potentials and capacities, "owning      things" can add nothing of authenticity. "Clad in the sky      with the earth for a pillow."			</p>      <h3>IV. TRANSFORMATION</h3>			<p>      <strong>The Condition</strong></p><p>      Position: The unbalance in man's relation to nature &      his selves is partly an inherent existential question with      biological and ultimate roots - birth, suffering, old age      and death; and partly a cultural problem. In approaching      questions of Being and Emptiness we have the wisdom      traditions and some emerging sciences to help us. In      transforming culture, we must augment the philosophical      perceptions with a deep study of history and      anthropology.<br />      <br />      Situation: Our civilized - and probably most other -      societies of the last three millenia have functioned well      enough up to this point. But they no longer have survival      value. They are now anti-survival.<br />      <br />      Goal: Nothing short of total transformation will work. What      we envision is a planet on which the human population lives      harmoniously and dynamically by employing a sophisticated      and unobtrusive technology in a world environment which is      "left natural." Specific points in this vision:<br />      <br />      A healthy and spacious population of all races, much less      in number than today.<br />      <br />      Cultural and individual pluralism, unified by a type of      world tribal council. Division by natural and cultural      areas rather than arbitrary political boundaries.<br />      <br />      A Technology of communication and quiet transportation:      land use being sensitive to the properties of each region.      Allowing, thus, the bison to return to much of the high      plains. Careful but intensive agriculture in the great      alluvial valleys. Computer technicians who run the plant      part of the year and walk along with the Elk in their      migration during the rest<br />      <br />      A basic cultural outlook and social organization that      inhibits power and property-seeking while encouraging      exploration and challenge in things like healing songs,      flute-playing, meditation, mathmatics, mountaineering, and      all the other possible ways of authentic      being-in-the-world. Women totally free and equal. A new      kind of family - responsible, but more festive and relaxed      - is implicit.<br />      <br />      Action<br />      <br />      Social/political: It seems evident that there are      throughout the world certain social and religious forces      that have worked throughout history toward an      ecologically/culturally enlightened state of affairs. Let      these be encouraged: Alchemists, hip Marxists, Anarchists,      Third Worlds, Teilhard and cryptoGnostic Catholics, Druids,      Witches, Taoists, Biologists, Yogins, Quakers, Tibetans,      Zens, Shamans, Sufis, Amish and Mennonite, American      Indians, Polynesians - all primitive cultures, all communal      and ashram movements of all persuasions, &c. The list      is long. Since it doesn't seem practical or even desirable      th think that direct bloody force will achieve anything, it      would be best to consider this a continuing "revolution of      consciousness" which will be won not by guns but by siezing      the key images, myths, archetypes, eschatologies, and      ecstasies so that life won't seem worth living unless one's      on the transforming energy's side.<br />      <br />      Our community: Without falling into a facile McLuhanism, we      can hope to use the media. New schools, new classes, -      walking in the woods and cleaning up the streets. Let no      one be ignorant of the facts of biology and related      disciplines; bring up our children with natural things and      a taste of the wild. Let some groups establish themselves      in backwater rural areas and flourish, let others maintain      themselves in the urban centers, and let them work      together, a two-way flow of experience, people, money and      home-grown vegetables. Investigating new lifestyles is our      work - as is the exploration of Ways to change one's      innerworld - with the known dangers of crashing that go      with such. We should work where it helps with political      people, hoping to enlarge their vision. And with people of      all varieties of politics or ideologies at whatever point      they become aware of environmental urgencies. Master the      archaic and the primitive, as models of basic      nature-related cultural styles, as well as the most      imaginative future possibilities of science and technology,      and build a community where these two vectors cross.<br />      <br />      Our own heads: Is where it starts. Knowing that we are the      first human beings in history to have all of man's culture      and previous experience available to our study, and being      free enough of the weight of traditional cultures to seek      out a larger identity. - The first members of a civilized      society since the early Neolithic to wish to look clearly      into the eyes of the wild and see our selfhood, our family,      there. We have these advantages to set off the obvious      disadvantages of being as screwed up as we are - which      gives us a fair chance to penetrate into some of the      riddles of ourselves & the universe, and to go beyond      the idea of "man's survival" or "the survival of the      biosphere" and to draw our strength from the realization      that at the heart of things is some kind of serene and      ecstatic process which is actually beyond qualities and      beyond birth-and-death. "No need to survive!" "In the fires      that destroy the universe at the end of the kalpa, what      survives?" - 'The iron tree blooms in the void!"<br />      <br />      Knowing that nothing need be done, is where we begin to      move from.<br />      <br />      13. VIII. 40069<br />      <br />      <em>from<br /></em> <em>WHOLE EARTH CATALOG      SUPPLEMENT<br />      September, 1969</em> † Usually aging in concrete      vats or cisterns sunk in the earth adjoining the field is      the only processing. After @ 2 months the material is a      consistent fluid which can be ladled or pumped into the      soil between rows of plants.
