        <p>Several years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved a process called<a href="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opairrad.html" target="_blank">irradiation</a>for protecting meats, fruits, vegetables and spices fromdisease-causing bacteria. Irradiation uses gamma rays, electronbeams or X-rays to break up bacteria lurking in mass-producedfood.</p><br /><p>While consumers expressed little interest in purchasingirradiated foods, which must be labeled as such, the FDA recentlyproposed changing the rules governing how irradiated food islabeled. Currently, it must be labeled as 'Treated by/withirradiation' and with a radura symbol. Under the proposed rule,manufactures would be allowed to replace the word 'irradiation'with 'pasteurized.'</p><br /><p>A public comment period on the changes is open until July 3,2007. You can<a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/oc/dockets/comments/getDocketInfo.cfm?EC_DOCUMENT_ID=1511&SORT=&MAXROWS=15&START=1&CID=&AGENCY=FDA" target="_blank">write the FDA</a> about irradiated foods, or use the OrganicConsumers Association's<a href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/oca/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=11102" target="_blank">online form</a>.</p><br /><p>Here are answers to commonly asked questions aboutirradiation:<br /><strong><em>Does irradiating food make itradioactive?</em></strong><br /> No. There are three different methods used to irradiate foods, andwhile one of them does involve the use of nuclear radiation, noneof them render the food itself radioactive. Each method uses anenergy source, either gamma rays, x-rays or electron beams, toproduce high frequency energy that breaks the chemical bonds incells that are essential for cell growth and reproduction.</p><br /><p>Gamma rays, made with radioactive cobalt or cesium, are usedmore often than the other methods; however, the food never comes incontact with the material, so it can't become contaminated in thatway.<a href="http://www.epa.gov/radiation/sources/food_safety.htm" target="_blank">Accordingto the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, too much of thisradiation can make some of the atoms in the food unstable, (akaradioactive), but the FDA limits the amount of energy that can beused to prevent this from happening. Currently, the process hasbeen approved for meat and poultry, spices, as well as certainfruits and vegetables.</p><br /><p><strong><em>Will eating these foods harm myhealth?</em></strong><br /> No one really knows for sure, because there haven't been anystudies conducted on people who have eaten irradiated foods over along period of time. At the very least, irradiated foods areslightly less nutritious, since the process destroys nutrients suchas thiamine (an essential B vitamin) and also vitamin C. The<a href="http://www.usda.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>claims that this loss is insignificant, which isn't surprisingsince it's the same position they've taken regarding thenutritional decline of our food supply overall.</p><br /><p>Among the concerns voiced by George Tritsch, research professoremeritus at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., andothers is that bombarding foods with gamma rays creates freeradicals, the unstable molecular fragments that go about our bodiescrashing into cells as they search for an unimpaired molecule torender them stable again. In addition, certain fats subjected toirradiation produce potentially carcinogenic byproducts, such asformaldehyde and benzene, although many scientists dismiss thisconcern because similar compounds are created during ordinarycooking processes.</p><br /><p>See<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Whole-Foods-and-Cooking/2007-06-01/Shocking-News-About-Meat.aspx" target="_blank">Shocking News About Meat</a> from the June/July 2007 issue of<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></a> formore on meat safety issues.
