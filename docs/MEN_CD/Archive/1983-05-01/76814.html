        <p>As our friends north of the border may be aware, the plans for the <em>1988</em> Olympics, which are to be held in Canada, are already beginning to spark some controversy in the province of Alberta. It seems the Winter Olympics were <em>awarded</em> to Canada on the basis of approved downhill-skiing locations, and other sport sites, within Banff National Park. But when the time came to get permission to <em>use</em> the land in question, Banff Park officials imposed so many restrictions on the Calgary Olympic Committee that they were forced to look elsewhere. The committee then chose another spot in a nearby provincial forest ... unfortunately, they ended up clearing a mountainside of trees while creating the proposed ski runs in the <em>wrong location!</em> After the visiting international committee vetoed <em>that</em> site, the Calgary group had yet another route cut for consideration.</p><p>Several years ago, the U.S. government banned the use of diethylstilbestrol (DES)and other similar synthetic hormones that had been used to speed animal (and profit) growth in the livestock industry after questions arose over the long-term effects on humans who were eating meat produced with the chemicals. (Many readers may be aware of the controversy about the use of DES by pregnant women.) Oddly enough, however, DES use is still allowed in the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, where it turns chickens and cattle into living "fast food". Doctors there report that children raised on the DES-laced meat and milk are beginning to show unnaturally accelerated growth. Physicians have noted breast development on some six-year-old girls and the onset of menstruation in seven-year-olds. As news of these disorders spread through the Commonwealth, the consumption of milk dropped <em>5.5%,</em> and poultry sales plummeted <em>30%</em></p><p>Our report from over the ocean, in Germany, is mixed. On the negative side, <em>half</em> of that country's species of butterflies are now threatened with extinction. Fortunately, the toads are doing much better: In Munster, for the first time in German history (and in <em>world</em> history, as far as we know), all traffic was 'halted on a main highway-from <em>8:00</em> p.m. until midnight-to allow a migrating knot of 'toads to reach their spawning grounds.</p><h3>IT'S ALL HAPPENING AT THE ZOO</h3><p>It's too bad that the wild and rare California condor can't elicit consideration similar to that which the German toads received. Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <em>and</em> both the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos, are now advocating the seizure of <em>all</em> condors in the wild. They claim that the bird a chance for survival as a species <em>only</em> if it's confined and protected. What these organizations don't mention, however, is that live condor is considered to be quite a trophy by zoos, since it enhances the prestige of the institution <em>and</em> attracts visitors. FOE believes that protection of the wild condor, <em>and</em> of its habitat, should take precedence over building a captive flock for exhibition. If you agree, please send letters urging that the capture plan be halted immediately, and that it be replaced by a comprehensive habitat protection program, to: Office of Endangered Species, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Dept. TMEN, Washington, D.C. <em>20240.</em></p><p><strong>DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR</strong><strong>GETS PROMOTED</strong> Embattled Secretary of the Interior James Watt is trying to win friends and influence people ... and <em>his own employees</em> are among them' It seems that officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have been asked to promote the sale of a new book, <em>At</em><em>the Eye of the Storm-James Watt and the</em><em>Environmentalists,</em> among Interior Department employees. The volume, written by self-styled Watt defender Ron Arnold, is being offered to the civil servants at the bargain price of $6.00 (instead of the normal <em>$14.95)</em> per copy.</p><p>Questions about the <em>propriety</em> of this bit of promotion have been raised recently by an employee at Kodiak, Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge. In a letter to Congressman John Seiberling, the USFWS worker wrote, "In a time when 11% of our people are out of work and the national debt is skyrocketing toward Pluto, the government has absolutely no business promoting <em>anyone's</em> personal book or propaganda campaign." Congressman Seiberling has yet to take action on the matter.</p><h3>WASTE NOT, WANT NOT</h3><p>On the other side of the country, the citizens of Hooksett, New Hampshire are battling their state Supreme Court over the right to stop the construction of a hazardous-waste-treatment plant in their tiny town. The residents recently passed ordinances <em>prohibiting</em> such construction without voter approval... after the Stablex Corporation announced plans to build a facility on the banks of the Merrimac River, 1,000 feet from the town wells and close to a school. The state court, however, ruled-in December-that the town doesn't have authority in such matters, so Hooksett is left with the federal court as its only recourse. "The decision turns our town's planning board into a garden club," commented one citizen.</p><h3>NOW WHERE DID WE PUT THAT URANIUM?</h3><p>Since the beginning of the Atoms for Peace program in 1954, some 43 countries have received shipments of highly enriched uranium from the U.S. Unfortunately, the agencies responsible for <em>monitoring</em> the export of the nuclear fuel have no clear records of what has become of it ... since the General Accounting Office reports that only 7% has been shipped back to the U.S. Would an international "lost and found" listing help?</p><h3>HUDDLED ON THE HUDSON</h3><p>Despite objections from environmentalists <em>and</em> local residents, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has voted to restart the reactor facility at Indian Point ... which is located 35 miles north of New York City on the Hudson River. Some experts have termed the site an "insane" place to locate a nuclear power plant, because of the difficulty of planning emergency evacuation procedures for the thickly populated area. Though the first disaster drills weren't held until March, the plant was given the green light to start up by the head of the NRC, who said, "It is very unlikely that a serious accident will occur in the next few months." With a cool head like <em>that</em> in charge, what are we worried about?</p><h3>ENVIRONMENTAL WHAT AGENCY?</h3><p>News of alleged illegal activities at the Environmental Protection Agency-and particularly as they relate to administration of the Superfund for hazardous-waste cleanup-is widespread as this column is being written. It will probably be quite some time before we have any clear idea of just how serious the problems may be, but we'd like to leave a parting thought that goes beyond name-calling. The cleanup of waste dumps involves more than political squabbling, corporate profiteering, withholding of evidence, or breaking of laws ... it's a matter of life and death!</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to become a member of the worldwide organization Friends of the Earth, and/or receive their excellent paper</em> Not Man Apart, fill <em>out the coupon below, and mail it with your check to: Friends of the Earth, Dept.
