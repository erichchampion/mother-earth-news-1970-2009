        <em>In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts regarding one of humankind's better ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced our still-standing offer: Send us a short account of an actual barter, and if we print it in this column (write Successful Swaps, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), 105 Stoney Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791), you'll receive a 12-month subscription (new or extended) to MOTHER.<br /><br /></em>We've adopted bartering as a way <em>of</em> life out here in the boondocks, where we're exchanging our caretaking skills for the use <em>of</em> a house and a few acres <em>of</em> land. Being far removed from civilization has its disadvantages, though . . . especially since the members <em>of</em> my family are all avid readers, and we often have a hard time getting to a library.<br /><br />However, since I'm a freelance cartoonist, I thought that I might be able to swap my drawings for magazines. So I picked out some publications that interested us, and offered cartoons to each <em>of</em> the periodicals in exchange for a subscription. We now receive a number <em>of</em> magazines and trade journals <em>of</em> our choice . . . because-so far-my deal has <em>never</em> been turned down!<br /><br />Furthermore-thanks to the success <em>of</em> those original swaps-I'm now getting additional orders for freelance cartoon work . . . and that extra cash is helping us purchase nonbarterable items.<br /><br />G.R.O.<br />Washington<br /><br />Even though a friend and I were confident that our consulting firms-each providing a different sort <em>of</em> expertise-offered valuable services to local businesses, we were having trouble <em>selling</em> our ideas to potential clients. Then we discovered that we were each much more successful at promoting the <em>other's</em> enterprise than at publicizing our own!<br /><br />This is how our trade works: I call on prospective customers, convince them that they could benefit from my friend's service, and set up interviews for him. He, in turn, does the same for me, and-on occasion-we also help each other with projects that involve our individual specialties.<br /><br />Self-employment provides a lot <em>of</em> opportunities for barter, but ours is the most unusual-and successful-"corporate swap" we've seen yet!<br /><br />R.C.<br />California<br /><br />I've discovered that trading my mechanical skills for things I need and want is extremely gratifying. However, fulfilling my dream <em>of</em> learning to fly-something I had never before been able to <em>afford</em> to do-has been my best swap ever.<br /><br />It all started last year, you see, when our local airport offered <em>free</em> ground-school classes. I enrolled in the program, and before long I'd struck up a friendship with the instructor. So, when I discovered that he was an aircraft mechanic, I suggested that we barter my shop assistance for flying lessons . . . and he liked the idea so much that we immediately worked out a trade.<br /><br />Now, I'm well on my way to realizing my dream ... since I'm accumulating flying time in exchange for occasional labor in my instructor's workshop.<br /><br />R.W.<br />Texas<br /><br />My husband and I love to go backpacking, but the birth <em>of</em> our baby daughter made us wonder whether we should take a summer's moratorium on wilderness outings. After all, we weren't sure that we really wanted to pack diapers, blankets, baby food, <em>and</em> our delicate child into the backcountry.<br /><br />However, I discussed the problem with my sister, who lives close by, and we came up with an arrangement that would benefit everyone involved. She and her husband don't enjoy the out-of-doors as we do, you see, but their athletic 14-year-old son had always listened to our tales <em>of</em> hiking and camping with unconcealed excitement. So we decided a "kid swap" was in order: We'd take their son backpacking while they cared for our baby girl!<br /><br />After a relaxing five-day trip into the wilderness, we returned with a tanned and enthusiastic teenager whom we'd gotten to know and love, and picked up our happy, well-cared-for little girl, who had delighted <em>her</em> temporary parents!<br /><br />M.O.<br />Montana<br /><br />When my spouse and I opened our own business, we <em>knew</em> we should have a sign for our store. We found the custom-made variety to be extremely expensive, however, and we were anxious to keep the costs <em>of</em> all our initial purchases to a minimum. As it happened, though, our business was located next to a signmaker's shop, and I discovered that he was weeks behind in filling his orders.. Well, although I knew nothing about engraving, I <em>was</em> interested in learning . . . and, I suppose, the thought <em>of</em> a possible barter gave me courage. In short, I offered to do engraving work for our business neighbor for a month, part time, in exchange for his making a sign for us. Evidently the artist thought the swap was a good one. He took me up on it immediately and gave me training not only in engraving, but in all the <em>other</em> aspects of his profession that interested me.<br /><br />As it turned out, he liked my work so much that he's kept me on, at a nice wage and with flexible hours. Furthermore, I got to make the very sign I'd bartered for! That custom-made "shingle", <em>and</em> a custommade job, resulted in one <em>rewarding</em> trade.<br /><br />A.W.<br />California<br /><br />My husband Mike and I are turning our hobbies-ham radio and cooking-into tools for barter. Our first swap came about when a welder friend, who was planning a year-long sailing trip, turned to amateur radio in his search for a means of on-board communication. Mike tutored him in the basics of Morse code and taught him the technical theory required for the F.C.C. exam . .. and-as a result-our buddy now has his license, and we have a shovel and poker for our woodstove and a monogrammed boot scraper for our front porch.<br /><br />Another acquaintance had an unused 60' tower rusting on his property. Well, as you've probably guessed, my husband is giving <em>him</em> "ham" lessons in exchange for the tower, which will serve as a mount for our radio antenna.<br /><br /><em>I've</em> gotten into the act, too! I occasionally cook dinner for these same friends, and-in return-I get an evening out, while they care for our son. As you can see, we're becoming confirmed "horse-traders"!<br /><br />E.R.P.<br />Idaho<br /><br />I'm always on the lookout for ways to stretch our limited finances, and keeping a home vegetable garden is by far the easiest way I know to extend a food allowance. This year, though, deciding <em>where</em> to put my growing spot presented a problem . . . since I was limited to using the small back yard of our new city house. I feared that the delicate seedlings wouldn't stand a chance when competing with my children and their active friends, yet I hated to deprive the youngsters of their play area.<br /><br />However, as the signs of spring appeared (and my green thumb began itching in earnest), I noticed that my next-door neighbor hadn't touched her garden plot. So one morning I went over, introduced myself with a batch of warm muffins, and proposed an idea.<br /><br />So far our deal has worked beautifully. My neighbor-an elderly widow who lives alone-enjoys visiting while I tend "her" garden, and, as an added bonus, I can let my year-old daughter roam at will in the fenced yard. (Most of the time, though, the toddler runs to sit in "Grandma's" lap while I'm busy digging.) Our household eats organically grown-and inexpensive-food, my boys have our whole back yard to play in, and (perhaps best of all) my neighbor has become part of a family again.<br /><br />S.C.<br />Minnesota
