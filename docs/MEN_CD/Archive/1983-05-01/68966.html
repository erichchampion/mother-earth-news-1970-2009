        <p>Believe it or not, homemade soups can be just as easy <em>(and</em> affordable) to fix as they are delicious <em>(and</em> nutritious) to eat! Why, in our house, these made-from-scratch dishes (often chock-full of vegetables from the garden) are mealtime mainstays all year round . . . even in the <em>summer!</em><br /><br />I got hooked on making my own soups a couple of years ago, when-after searching through a rack of cookbooks to find <em>yet another</em> way to prepare the mountains of zucchini we were harvesting-I came across a recipe for a squash soup, calling for a combination of pureed zucchini, chicken stock, milk, and spices . . . topped with yogurt. Unable to resist, I tried it . . . and it turned out to be <em>fabulous!</em> With a pale creamy green color and a delightfully delicate flavor, the zucchini potage was a treat for the eyes and a feast for the palate!<br /><br />Once I'd discovered how tasty our squash could be when added to a simple poultry bouillon and milk base, with a few spices and yogurt for extra flavoring, I decided to experiment with other vegetables, and <em>different</em> broths and herbs. And before I knew it, I was an enthusiastic (and prolific!) soup simmerer . . . with my own "stock" formula which has since served as the basis of an endless variety of sumptuous "brewed from scratch" delicacies. So, if <em>you're</em> a potential soupmaker too, I think you'll enjoy the following tips . . . why, they just might help you get the soup "bowl" rolling around your house.</p><h3>THE BASICS </h3><p>The most important task in soupmaking is the preparation of the <em>stock</em> (the job requires time, but <em>not</em> vigilance). All that you'll need to start with are [1] soup bones (any kind will do, including chicken, beef, ham, and fish) . . . [2] a couple of celery stalks (with leaves), a carrot, and an onion . . . [3] a bay leaf (use <em>three</em> of these when preparing fish broth), several sprigs of parsley, and a dash of vinegar . . . and, of course, [4] a large pot (about eight to ten-quart capacity, if possible) with a lid.<br /><br />To begin, place the bones in the kettle and pour in enough water to cover them completely. Then add I tablespoon of vinegar for every 3 quarts of stock (I think this helps draw the nutrients and flavor out of the bones). Next, chop the parsley and vegetables and toss them in, along with the bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat . . . cover the pot . . . and simmer the ingredients till the vegetables are soft and most of the meat has dropped of the bones.<br /><br />After cooking the stock for a <em>minimum</em> of 1 hour, remove the pot from the stove and strain off and refrigerate the broth. Save the vegetables and the meat (you may want to pick some of it off the bones) and put them aside to use later. Then, once the liquid has thoroughly cooled, skim off any fat (it'll have risen to the surface). What's left should form the base for <em>several</em> batches of soup, so just freeze what you don't need right away, and pour the rest into a fresh pot . . . lunch will be ready in no time! <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:</em><br /><br /><em>Some cooks prefer to scrape the fat</em> <em>off</em> <em>stock only when they're ready to use the base, since the thin layer of grease does tend to help seal out air and preserve the broth.]</em> </p><h3>IS IT SOUP YET?</h3><p>With the stock prepared, puree the meat and vegetables you set aside and use them to thicken the broth. If you need more "additives", check out your refrigerator to see what sort of interesting (potentially blendable) leftovers you've got. Practically any cooked vegetable will do (except <em>beets,</em> which tend to be pretty overpowering unless you're making borsch). And don't turn up your nose at last night's cheese sauce or that half-empty can of tomato paste, either. Even this morning's Cream of Wheat cereal, or yesterday's grits, can be used to add flavor and substance to soup.<br /><br />Then again, just in case you get carried away and add <em>too many</em> pureed edibles to the pot, it's a good idea to have some stored vegetable "juice" (left from cooking and canning, say) on hand to use as a thinner. (This nutritious-and tasty-liquid can also serve as a fine soup <em>base if</em> you'd rather not use meat stock.)<br /><br />After your "brew" reaches a pleasing consistency, the only other thing it needs-to give it that satisfying gourmet aura-is a touch <em>of</em> spice <em>(carefully</em> added, a <em>pinch</em> at a time, while the soup is hot). The most popular potage seasoners are the "big French three": <em>sweet basil, thyme,</em> and <em>marjoram.</em> While these spices used individually or combined-add zest to most broths and chowders, <em>summer</em> (or <em>winter) savory is</em> a must for bean creations. However, my favorite flavor enhancer is the hard-to-find (yet easy-to-grow, indoors or out) <em>chervil.</em> This tasty green herb is both subtle <em>and</em> versatile . . . and can be tossed into a pot of soup by the handful, or sprinkled sparingly on each serving.<br /><br /><strong>A FEW FINAL TIPS</strong><br /><br />Cream soups-garnished with sprigs of parsley or chervil, bacon bits, freshly made croutons, or paprika-are delicious, but they're also likely to be quite rich (since they're usually made with cream or a white sauce). So, if you're calorie-conscious, try creating your cream concoctions with yogurt or pureed cottage cheese rather than the traditional ingredients. The result will be just as tasty, and not nearly as "weighty"!<br /><br />Clear soups, on the other hand, are low i n calories, because-for the most part-all they consist of is a light broth plus a judicious amount of chopped vegetables and, maybe, a half-cup of cooked rice or noodles. (When you make one of these dishes, try adding a dash of lemon or some tomato juice to lend it a bit of tang.)<br /><br />However-whether you choose to make hearty vegetable medleys . . . savory cream potpourris . . . simple nutritious broths . . . or (if you're like me) <em>all three-I'm willing</em> to bet it won't take you too long to fill up a recipe box with original soup ideas to fit practically any occasion. I just hope, after your family gets a taste of how scrumptious "homebrew" can be, that you'll be able to stir up a batch of it as quickly as <em>they</em> can stir up a year-round appetite for homemade soup!<br /><br /><strong>SOUPS TO BEGIN WITH</strong><br /><br />I wrote down the following recipes <em>as 1 made</em> the soups (using whatever ingredients I happened to have on hand!):<br /><br /><em>VEGETARIAN SOUP</em><br /><br />4 cups of water left over from cooking carrots and/or potatoes<br />1 small potato, cooked<br />1 small carrot, diced and cooked<br />2/3 cup of cauliflower, cooked<br />1/8 teaspoon of dried dill weed<br />salt to taste<br />a pinch of paprika<br /><br />Start this hearty brew by pureeing everything <em>except</em> the salt and paprika. Then heat the ingredients (in a pot) to the boiling point before adding any salt. Garnish the soup <em>when you</em> serve it-with a generous shake of paprika . . . and it should satisfy two to four healthy appetites!<br /><br /><em>VEGETABLE MEDLEY SOUP</em><br /><br />4-5 tiny onions, sauteed<br />4-8 small leaves of cabbage, cooked<br />3 baby carrots, cooked<br />1/2 cup of green beans, cooked<br />1/3 cup of cooked tomatoes<br />2 cups of chicken broth <em><br /></em>1 cup of water left over from cooking potatoes<br />tiny mushroom caps, sauteed<br />salt to taste<br /><br />Puree the first <em>five</em> ingredients in a small amount <em>of</em> broth, and pour this blend into a saucepan with the potato water, the remaining broth, and the mushroom caps. Then warm the soup and add salt <em>(if</em> necessary). This nutritious recipe makes enough to satisfy a family <em>of</em> four.<br /><br /><em>CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP</em><br /><br />1/2 bunch of broccoli<br />3 cups of chicken broth<br />3-5 heaping tablespoons of yogurt<br />salt to taste<br />1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg<br />a handful of fried noodles<br /><br />Remove the tough portions of the broccoli stems. Cut the heads into small pieces and cook these in the chicken broth until they're tender. Then puree them <em>with</em> the broth and yogurt. Now, pour this mixture into a saucepan and heat it just to the boiling point. Salt the soup to taste . . . and-as you ladel it into bowls-add the nutmeg and fried noodles to each serving. Be thrifty when portioning it out, though, because this recipe makes only three helpings!<br /><br /><em>CLEAR SOUP</em><br /><br />4 cups of strained chicken or beef stock<br />2/3 cup of shredded raw spinach (watercress or chervil) or 1/4 cup of chopped spinach, cooked<br />1/2 cup <em>of</em> peas, cooked<br />1/4 cup <em>of</em> diced raw carrots salt to taste<br /><br />This one's easy, and should make enough for four hungry people. Just put all the ingredients into a saucepan and let them simmer for about 5 minutes, salting to taste when the mixture is hot.<br /><br /><em>LIMA BEAN SOUP</em><br /><br />1/2 cup <em>of</em> cooked rice <em><br /></em>1 cup o <em>f</em> lima beans, cooked<br />1 quart <em>of</em> chicken or meat stock<br />2 tablespoons <em>of</em> marinara sauce (tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and spices)<br />salt to taste<br /><br />Puree the rice and limas with a cup <em>of</em> the broth. Then add this blend, along with the marinara sauce, to a pan containing the rest of the stock. Heat the mixture, seasoning it as you like. This recipe serves two to four hungry folks.</p>
