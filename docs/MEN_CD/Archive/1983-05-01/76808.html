        W.W. Donovan has a way to avoid (temporarily, at least) being inconvenienced by a dead battery cell. Mr. Donovan-a Floridian who resides in Titusville-says the following "fix" works about 90% of the time. Using a hydrometer, he first finds which cell is dead, and adds one teaspoon of Epsom salts to that "empty pocket". Next, W.W. tops off <em>all</em> the cells with water and places the battery on a charger. If no charge can be measured, he adds <em>another</em> teaspoon of Epsom salts. Then if-after three such applications-no charge is noticed, the battery falls in the 10% failure category. However, the Sunshine Stater says this cure should carry most batteries through a few more months (perhaps until you can afford to buy a new one).<br /><br />May and June are often considered "wedding months", and if <em>your</em> spring calendar includes a few of these nuptial celebrations, you might want to take this tip from Norma Sizemore of Lima, Ohio. When the reception ends with the traditional custom of throwing rice at the bride and groom, Mrs. Sizemore collects the small pieces of leftover netting (which held the grains) and carries them home. She's found that they're the perfect size to cover her sprout jars, and-when held in place with a rubber band-they'll keep even the tiniest alfalfa seeds in the jar!<br /><br />A MOTHER-reader from Hernando, Florida recommends that automobile owners drop an expired driver's license down inside one of the window wells of their vehicles. According to Thelma Mahoney, this practice could help prove you own the car in the event that it's stolen.<br /><br />When Virginia McQuitty was a child, her grandmother's table was often loaded with mountains of food and lots of special goodies (like homemade pickles!). Virginia recalls that her grandma always kept a "spoon jar" on the table to be sure to have enough utensils to handle the feasts. Today, the Delbarton, West Virginia MOTHER-reader keeps a wide-mouth pint jar filled with "odds and ends" of spoons and forks on <em>her</em> kitchen table. The practice eliminates the need to jump up for extra silverware for coffee, jellies, pickles, desserts, cereals . . . <em>or</em><em>spoon-dropping kids!</em><br /><br />While polishing up an old brass fire extinguisher, Ron Bradshaw noted the chemical properties of the very expensive metal cleaning solution he was using. The Louisville, Kentucky resident decided that the liquid looked and reacted much like dilute sulfuric acid, more commonly known as "battery acid". Well, Ron just happened to have some of that corrosive chemical on hand . . . having used the solution previously for tanning hides. He applied the dilute acid to the brass and discovered that it worked quite well, and cost about one-sixteenth as much as the original cleaner. (Naturally, Ron warns users to exercise caution when handling this solution.)<br /><br />The next time you visit a dump or junkyard, you might want to "harvest" the vegetable bins from any old, discarded refrigerators that you find, advises Sherry Miranda of West Lafayette, Indiana. Sherry says they make ideal storage units inside barns or sheds, because they won't rust (unless the enamel coating is chipped or cracked) ... they're easily cleaned ... and many already have holes bored, which make it easy to nail the bins to the wall.<br /><br />And while you're at the junkyard, be sure to pick up a few <em>seat belts</em> from discarded cars. According to Morrow Olcott of Bloomsbury, New Jersey, the straps make great gate latches. Just nail one to your wooden gate post, and the other to your fence "door". (If your gate is metal, attach both cloth strips to the post, then pass one buckle end around the upright member on the gate and back to the other.) Morrow says they're weatherproof, easily installed, don't cost much, and never get out of alignment the way most conventional latches eventually do. Best of all, the Garden Stater claims, although it takes only one hand to push the button to open a belt, no animal of his has ever figured out how to free itself!<br /><br />For fluffier omelets, simply add a pinch of pancake mix to the egg blend before cooking. This will keep the omelets from going flat when they cool, as well . . . according to Owen Bradford of Phoenix, Arizona.<br /><br />"When rock-hopping with my fishing rod, I like to travel as lightly as possible," writes Doug Smith of Cambria, California. "But I used to have trouble finding a suitable place for my spare hooks and leaders ... a spot where they wouldn't tangle together. Well, now I just slip the made-up leaders and hooks into a wallet-sized photograph holder. One rig fits in each plastic sleeve, and the whole packet rides neatly in my front shirt pocket."<br /><br />To keep gold chains or other delicate necklaces tangle-free, simply run the links through a plastic drinking straw and fasten the clasp on the outside. What's more, as Don Carroll of Owasso, Oklahoma writes, "If the straw is too long to fit in the jewelry box, it can be folded or bent and will <em>still</em> keep your necklaces straightened!"<br /><br />"If you have a youngster who's allergic to nuts, brown some oatmeal in a bit of butter or margarine, and use the crunchy flakes as a substitute for chopped nuts in candy or cookie recipes, " writes Mrs. Arthur E. Norha of Virginia, Minnesota.<br /><br />When Charlotte Pierce hosts a gathering in her Greensburg, Kentucky home, she places a colored light bulb in the outside socket on her porch. That way, Charlotte writes, she can tell any guests who are uncertain about where she lives what color porch light to watch for.<br /><br />In issue 79, MOTHER ran an article on how to convert a discarded shopping cart into a bicycle-wheeled carryall for suburban and urban shoppers. Well, reader John Onuska of Beaver, Pennsylvania has another use for old or damaged grocery carts. He converts the metal baskets into rabbit hutches!<br /><br />MOTHER-reader Country Monia sent in this interesting bit of lore. According to the Topeka, Kansas resident, <em>colors</em> can influence our appetite for food. The Sunflower Stater suggests that green and blue make people feel <em>less</em> hungry (she wonders whether that might have something to do with the phrase "blue plate special"), while the color orange will cause diners to desire <em>more</em> food. Country is planning to redecorate her kitchen soon, <em>and</em> put a green light in her refrigerator!<br /><br /><em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the frustrating little problems of everyday life. Why not share your best "horse sense" with the rest of MOTHER's readers?
