        <p>THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED FISCAL 1984 BUDGET for the Department of Energy would [1] cut federal funds for energy conservation from $498.3 million to just $101.3 million ... [2] virtually kill the government's. highly effective weatherization and energy-assistance program for schools, hospitals, and other public buildings (moneys for such grants would be slashed from $282 million to a token $3.3 million) ... [3] channel more than 60% of the DOE's entire budget into defense-related accounts ... and [4] reduce funding for renewable energy sources-including sun, wind, and water-by more than 50%, to only $102.3 million (that's less than half of the $270 million that's been earmarked for just the Clinch River Breeder Reactor). Meanwhile, the largest single allotment on the White House's proposed budget for the United States is $3.9 billion ... to be spent on the development, testing, and production of nuclear weapons.</p><p>EACH YEAR, AMERICA'S REFRIGERATORS CONSUME ELECTRICITY AMOUNTING to nearly half of all the current produced by nuclear power plants in 1981 ... despite the fact that the efficiency of the "typical" (15-cubicfoot, frost-free) new model has improved by almost 15% since 1975. Furthermore, in a recent article in Technology Review, scientist David B. Goldstein points out that Japan is now marketing refrigerators that use electricity at a rate less than half that of comparable U.S. domestic models ... and that American appliance manufacturers may find themselves "in a plight similar to that of the automakers" if consumers become more aware of the massive amounts of energy-and money-their iceboxes are wasting.</p><p>"SOLAR REFRIGERATORS" MAY HELP FIGHT DISEASE IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES if prototypes now being developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration prove to be economically feasible. According to the World Health Organization, more than five million youngsters in underdeveloped nations die each year of childhood illnesses (measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, etc.) that can be prevented with immunizing vaccines. The medicines, however, are sensitive to heat and must be refrigerated. Conventional coolers (including kerosene-driven units) are impractical for such purposes in many regions so researchers are hoping that photovoltaic-powered units can be utilized to solve the problem.</p><p>A FOUR-MEGAWATT, WAVE-POWERED ELECTRICITY-GENERATING FACILITY may be built on the coastline of the Isle of Lewis (in Scotland's Outer Hebrides), if the results of a forthcoming two-year study are favorable. The power station would consist of a hollow, 60meter-long concrete breakwater equipped with turbines ... to be driven by air forced through vertical towers as waves break against the structure. The United Kingdom's Department of Industry believes that such facilities could-by the end of the century-produce costcompetitive electricity at numerous island locations (including the Falklands and Fiji). The environmental impact of wave-energy technology, however, remains to be evaluated ... and may yet prove to be the concept's undoing.</p><p>HIGH ENERGY COSTS WON'T TREAD ON THIS COMPANY: Bergey's, Inc., a tire retreading firm in Perkasie, Pennsylvania, has installed a $600,000 pyrolitic-process system that-according to the unit's manufacturer (Kutreib Corporation, Dept. TMEN, 430-T Phillip Street, Chetek, Wisconsin 54728)-will turn scrap tires into methane gas and a liquid fuel that's 4,000 BTU per gallon higher in heating value than conventional No. 2 oil. Furthermore, in addition to providing all of the gas and oil the company needs, the process will yield steel wire (scavenged from belted tires), nylon and rayon fibers, and carbon black ... all of which are marketable. The combined savings and sideline sales-with the help of federal tax credits amounting to $120,000-should pay for the entire system within just five yearsi</p><p>A $40 MILLION AD CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY'S "IMAGE" has been launched by the Committee for Energy Awareness, a public relations group representing utility companies ... 39 of which-at last report-had contributed funds to the effort (the organization has declined to release a complete list of participating firms). According to Georgia Power's chairman Robert Scherer-head of CEA's board of directors-the program is intended "to prove nuclear power is essential to our well-being". And who, exactly, will ultimately pay for the media blitz? Well, if the organization gets its way, consumers will. (Other companies represented on CEA's board of directors, incidentally include Pacific Gas and Electric, Commonwealth Edison, Middle South Utilities, Arizona Public Service, Texas Utilities, Houston Power and Lighting, Consumers Power, Carolina Power and Light, and Rocky Mountain Energy.)</p><p>A SUN-POWERED AIRCRAFT, DESIGNED TO MONITOR CROPS for the United States Department of Agriculture, is being developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Inc. Although apparently still on the drawing board, the device-called the High-Altitude Powered Platform (HAPP)-will likely be a long-winged affair with a single midmounted propeller driven by solar cells located on two vertical stabilizers and on both sides of its wing tips. These extremities will fold upward during the daytime to catch more sun and, at night, return to a more aerodynamic horizontal position ... making it easier for the craft to run on stored daylight power. With a wingspan of 150 to 300 feet and a total weight of somewhere between 1,000 and 3,000 pounds, the HAPP will probably cruise at a level of about 70,000 feet, above the zones of high wind activity.</p><p>WORLDWIDE OIL AND GAS WELL DRILLING WILL REACH A LEVEL OF 130,000 NEW HOLES A YEAR BY 1995, according to Predicasts, Inc.... Scenes for the movie Jaws 3-D were shot in a 110-foot-diameter tank containing, 1.6 MILLION GALLONS OF WATER WARMED BY THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST SOLAR WATER-HEATING SYSTEM. ... The sun's energy was tapped for a distinctly different purpose during last fall's "Fiesta Days" in Santa Barbara, California, where SOLAR-POWERED BLENDERS WERE USED TO MIX MARGARITAS .... Appropriately enough, EUROPE'S FIRST WIND FARM WILL BE BUILT IN THE NETHERLANDS, as a part of that country's progressive national wind-energy program.*</p>
