    <p>
                    <p>      <em>Garden magic from John Jeavons and Bill Bruneau.</em>    </p>        <p>      Green manuring - growing crops especially for their      organic matter and ability to improve the soil - can      dramatically build up poor and exhausted soils and maintain      the fertility of better ones. Let me give you two examples      from our own experience. When we first started Ecology      Action of the Mid-peninsula in 1974, we were minifarming a      site in the Stanford Industrial Park that had <em>no</em>      topsoil or subsoil: It had all been scraped off in      anticipation of future construction. Eight years later, we      had improved the soil to a depth of over two feet!    </p>    <p>      Then in 1982, we moved to our current steep hillside      location in northern California. Its thin rocky topsoil had      few available nutrients. Indeed, some feel the site      approximated marginal Third World growing conditions. But      now, four years later, it is becoming a beautiful and      productive garden/minifarm.    </p>    <p>      In both cases, we were able to dramatically improve the      soil through deep cultivation, intensive plant spacing, the      addition of composts and aged manures . . . <em>and</em> a      continuous program of growing green manure crops.    </p>    <p>      Green manuring will help your soil in many ways. Perhaps      most important, it boosts your plot's organic matter (O.M.)      level. And a high O.M. level (2.5 to 4%)    </p>    <p>      - keeps nutrients from leaching down beyond reach of      crops,    </p>    <p>      - provides food for microbial soil life,    </p>    <p>      - helps legumes fix nitrogen in their root nodules,    </p>    <p>      - and helps the soil produce good structure and      maintain the air-pore spaces essential to good crop health.    </p>    <p>      In addition, your green manure crops will <em>till the      soil</em> for you. Alfalfa, for instance, can send down      roots as deep as 60 feet, pulling up nutrients for next      year's crops. A single rye plant grown in good soil can      produce an average of three miles of roots per day -      387 miles of roots and 6,603 miles of root hairs in a      season! Such root and roothair growth will      <em>fiberize</em> the soil, helping loose soils bind      together and clay ones open up.    </p>    <p>      Green manures also provide a <em>living mulch</em> that      will protect soil from erosion and other weathering      effects. Indeed, right now, during the late summer and      early fall, is an excellent time to put in a green manure      crop. The plants will protect your garden from winter      damage and will produce organic matter during the      off-season, when much of. your plot would otherwise lie      fallow. Then next spring, your soil will have good tilth      instead of being hard and compacted.    </p>    <p>      Many fall-planted green manure crops will also <em>pump      excess water</em> out of the soil, allowing you to prepare      the soil and plant crops much earlier than usual. Fava      beans, for instance, can pump soil dry in as little as five      days of warm weather. (If, on the other hand, you are      trying to conserve soil moisture in early spring, you may      want to harvest your green manure crop on the first warm      day.)    </p>    <h3>      Compost It    </h3>    <p>      To get the maximum benefit from a green manure crop, you      should compost it. If, instead, you spade or till it      directly into the soil, you'll have to wait 30 days for it      to decompose before you can plant again. (Turning under      such a crop is also quite arduous.)    </p>    <p>      You'll do far better if you compost the current green      manure crop, while using compost made from the      <em>previous</em> growing season's green manure (along with      kitchen and other garden waste) to fertilize the current      planting. You can harvest the crop by pulling it out by      hand or skimming it off with a sharpened spade.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: See "Skimming the Garden" in MOTHER NO.      99, page 72, for a complete explanation of this      technique.]</em> In our experience, a one-inch layer of      cured compost - about eight cubic feet per 100 square      feet - appears to maintain fertile soil in good      health. (Other organic fertilizers may be needed to      initially build up a soil's nutrient reserve . . . or even      to maintain that level if not <em>all</em> waste nutrients      are returned to the soil.)    </p>    <p>      We feel <em>the</em> secret to composting green manures      successfully is to combine lots of fresh green matter (from      a legume crop, when possible) with lots of dry carbonaceous      matter <em>and</em> one-third topsoil (by weight). The      green matter - from your freshly cut manure crop      - provides nitrogen to the pile. The dry matter      - from a previously cut manure crop, or other dry      material such as leaves and straw - provides the      carbon that <em>holds</em> the water-soluble nitrogen in      the compost (and, later, in the soil). And the topsoil      slows and cools the composting process. There are      indications that slow-cooked compost will produce 12-40%      more compost (excluding the soil itself from these      percentages) than hot-cooked piles. Hotter piles, in      effect, burn off part of their mass.    </p>    <h3>      Four Old Standbys    </h3>    <p>      Below are some good green manure crops you might think      about growing. When choosing one green manure over another,      consider    </p>    <p>      - how much O.M. it will add to the soil,    </p>    <p>      - how much nitrogen it will return to the soil (many      soils need up to .5 pound of nitrogen per 100 square feet      per year),    </p>    <p>      - if it can pull up nutrients from the substrate      below,    </p>    <p>      - if the crop fits your particular soil and weather      conditions,    </p>    <p>      - and if you want the harvest to also provide food      for your family.    </p>    <p>      Remember that two or more green manure crops can often be      grown together to their mutual benefit, and that you can      frequently save seed from your current crops so you can      reseed for <em>free</em> next year.    </p>    <p>      The first four crops we'll list are old standbys; ones that      have served often and well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cereal rye</strong> produces lots of organic matter      (the rye straw grows up to seven feet high) <em>and</em>      lots of roots (which makes it very good for fiberizing      compacted soil). It's also drought-tolerant and very      winter-hardy . . . and, of course, can give you food: rye      grain.    </p>    <p>      Sow this rye in cool weather - in many areas, you can      plant it in fall and expect it to overwinter and produce      abundantly the next spring. It matures in as little as 16      to 18 weeks of growing season. If you want to harvest the      grain, time your planting so the rye will have only about      one month of hot weather before it matures. Yields are up      to 60 pounds of rye straw per 100 square feet plus 4 to 26      pounds of grain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Agricultural mustard</strong> is a very      <em>fast</em> way to get lots of green matter: It can      mature in as little as six weeks and yield 180 to 270      pounds of green matter per 100 square feet!    </p>    <p>      Other benefits are that agricultural mustard will grow in      cold or hot weather and that it apparently has the ability      to bring health back to rundown soil. It's often used in      orchards to reclaim and "invigorate" land. It also attracts      honeybees.    </p>    <p>      You can harvest this O.M. crop at any growing stage, but      just after flowering is best.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Alfalfa</strong> can be grown for just one growing      season, but this perennial is better used for long-term      soil buildup . . . say, in an area you plan to start      cultivating in a year or two. A deep-rooting crop, it      boosts fertility by pulling nutrients up from subsoil. And      since it's a legume, its roots fix nitrogen in the soil:      from .36 to .57 pounds per 100 square feet per year.    </p>    <p>      Drought-tolerant alfalfa thrives in all growing seasons,      maturing in about 17 weeks (although it can take a while to      get a stand established). You can harvest ituse it for      green matter, not dry - repeatedly through the      season. Traditionally, farmers cut their alfalfa at      nine-week intervals, but the best times are when about 10%      of the plants are in bloom; those can be anytime from three      to twelve weeks apart depending on climate and season.      Alfalfa can provide from three to six cuttings a year and      from 80 to 360 pounds and more of green matter.    </p>    <p>      When you want to clear the land for other crops, you'll      have to dig the roots out - a job hard enough to keep      you in shape without jogging. (If you clear the crop out      when it's just three months old, you won't have to dig the      roots out, but can let them decompose in the ground.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Banner fava beans</strong> are quite hardy legumes      that are very good for spring growing. If your winters      don't drop below 10°F, a fall planting will keep      growing throughout the cold months. The plant grows from      four to six feet high, produces lots of green O.M., and, as      noted earlier, can bring up excess moisture from damp      spring ground. It also tolerates acidic soil conditions.      When we minifarmed in mildclimate Stanford, fava beans made      our garden productive year-round and were our favorite      green manure crop.    </p>    <p>      Banner favas mature in 11 to 26 weeks. They fix .16 pounds      or more of nitrogen per 100 square feet per season, and can      yield 90 to 360 pounds of green matter. They also can yield      5 to 18 pounds of dry beans. Many people enjoy eating fava      beans - they are a staple in Egypt - but a few      people <em>are</em> fatally allergic to them.    </p>    <p>      The next four crops we'll discuss are some unusual,      <em>specialty</em> , ones you might consider growing.    </p>    <h3>      Specialty Crops    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Alsike clover</strong> is the "poor soil      workhorse." It grows in any temperature except severe cold      ... tolerates depleted, acidic, and poorly drained ground .      . . and stands up well to drought. The legume produces an      adequate (not large) amount of green matter and nitrogen      (about .27 pounds of N per 100 square feet). Sow it in      spring or autumn for best results.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fodder radish</strong> has a deep taproot for      bringing up nutrients from the subsoil and produces more      organic matter per day than almost any other green manure      crop. Although you can use it for green matter, it will      also produce a great deal of carbonaceous dry matter if you      let it grow for several months until the plants are      "woody."    </p>    <p>      Fodder radish grows well in hot or cool weather, but it's      best sown in late summer, early autumn, or early spring. It      will mature in as little as 17 weeks and can yield 100 to      500 pounds of green matter per 100 square feet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wooly pod vetch</strong> , like alsike clover, is      good at growing in poor soil and under conditions such as      heat or drought. In addition, it's <em>very</em> hardy      - it can handle cold down to 0°F! (It's more      cold-tolerant, but less productive, than its cousins purple      and hairy vetch.) It can also help knock out weeds in a      garden by outcompeting them.    </p>    <p>      A medium-fast-growing legume, wooly pod vetch produces only      an adequate amount of green matter (about 50 to 200 pounds      per 100 square feet) and nitrogen (up to .25 pounds). It      matures in 12 weeks and can be harvested more than once at      approximately nine week intervals.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Foul muddammas beans</strong> grow well in heat, so      they're suitable for late spring and summer sowing. They      also have a good root system which can fix up to 16 or more      pounds of nitrogen per 100 square feet.    </p>    <p>      Foul muddammas mature in 11 to 26 weeks, depending on      season, and yield 45 to 180 pounds of green matter per 100      square feet and 5 to 30 pounds of beans.    </p>    <p>      The last green manure crops we'll mention have an extra      "by-product": They can be harvested for food as well as for      dry carbonaceous organic matter.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>A fall green manure crop gives off-season      garden productivity!</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>      Double-Duty Crops    </h3>    <p>      Drought-tolerant <strong>hard red spring wheat</strong>      should be planted early so it will mature after only about      one month of hot weather. (Its growing season is from 16 to      18 weeks.) It produces a lot of straw for dry O.M.: 20 to      60 pounds per 100 square feet.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>SOWING GREEN MANURE CROPS</h3>    <p>      Almost all of the green manure crops mentioned in this      article can be directly sown into prepared soil by      hand-broadcasting. When doing so, <em>under</em> broadcast      at first, so you'll have some seed left to fill in any      gaps. Then gently chop the seed into the soil by poking      holes in the area with a rake. You may also want to tamp      the soil down with a wide board to eliminate excess air      spaces. Finally, water the area thoroughly.</p>        <p>      Some of the crops will produce more, and more quickly if      you first sprout them in soil on 1" centers in growing      flats. After 5 to 10 days, when the seedlings are about      1-1/2" to 2" tall, transplant them into the garden. This      works well with cereal rye, alfalfa, hard red spring wheat,      barley, and oats - all of which set out on 5"      centers.    </p>    <p>      Banner fava bean seed should be directly planted on 7"      centers, and foul muddammas fava beans should be directly      planted on 6" centers.</p>    </div>        <p>      The grain yield is 4 to 26 pounds per 100 square feet (the      average American consumes about 110 pounds of wheat per      year).    </p>    <p>      Like spring wheat, <strong>barley</strong> should be      planted to mature after only one month of hot weather. But      barley has a much shorter growing season - from 9 to      10 weeks! - so you can sneak it in a spot you can      spare for only two to three months. It actually contains      somewhat less protein and calcium per pound than wheat or      oats, but - due to its shorter growing season -      produces more of these nutrients per day of growing time.    </p>    <p>      Barley is a good straw producer (up to 60 pounds per 100      square feet) and yields 5 to 24 pounds of grain (the      average American consumes only about 1.2 pounds of barley      each year).    </p>    <p>      Grow your own oatmeal! Cold-hardy <strong>oats</strong>      mature in 13 to 17 weeks, and like barley and spring wheat,      need about one month of hot weather near harvest.    </p>    <p>      One hundred square feet will yield up to 60 pounds of oat      straw and 4 to 17 pounds of oats (the average American      consumes about 3.2 pounds of oats each year).    </p>    <p>      There are many other good green manure crops. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: The ones we've used most often at MOTHER 's      Eco-Village have been winter rye mixed with hairy vetch for      fall-to-spring plantings . . . and buckwheat for      short-term, warm-season growing.]</em> Any of them will      help you build a living soil from which you can harvest      increased crop yields.    </p>    <p>      Building your own soil is important for broader reasons, as      well. When we use fertilizers and organic matter from      somewhere else for our gardens, we may actually be      depleting the soil resource base of another growing area.      By improving our own soil base with "homegrown" materials,      we're taking a small step toward improving our whole      planet's soil and life resources.    </p>    <p>      In fact, in a world of diminishing agricultural      petrochemical resources, green manure is as precious as      gold. From 1975 to the year 2000, it is expected that the      percentage of desert on the earth's land surface will      increase from 49% to 63% or more - and one-third of      this process is expected to occur in the United States!      Each backyard garden or homestead can contribute to our      planet's much-needed increase in soil fertility.    </p><hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Ecology Action sells seed for all of the      above-mentioned green manure crops, in allotments big      enough to cover 100 square feet.
