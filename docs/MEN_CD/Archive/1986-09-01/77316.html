                    <p>      <em>If you'd like our panel of consultants to answer a      question concerning some aspect of selfreliant living that      has you stumped, send it to Ask Our Experts, MOTHER EARTH      NEWS, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, NC 28793.

We have a problem we never thought we'd have -      too many apples. Our trees are "overbearing," and we don't      know what to do with all the fruit!    </p>        <p>      Congratulations! And I'm glad you don't want to let any of      your harvest go to waste. The easiest way to preserve      apples - if you have the right storage space -      is to "cellar" them. Firm, unbruised apples can keep four      months or longer if they're stored at 32 to 40°F and      80% to 90% humidity. (Some folks wrap each one to keep them      from touching.)    </p>    <p>      Another classic way to process lots of apples is to make      applesauce. Just simmer cored and peeled quarters in water      until tender, mash through a food mill (actually, Golden      Delicious apples make nice chunky applesauce if unmashed),      add sweetening to taste (none is fine by me), pack hot in      clean canning jars, and process in a hotwater bath (10      minutes for pints, 15 for quarts).    </p>    <p>      Then there's apple butter, which is made by simmering one      part cider with two parts peeled and cored apples -      stirring occasionally - until the mass gets very      thick (this can take several hours). Add sweetening and      spices (cinnamon, allspice, ground cloves) to Taste, and      process 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath.    </p>    <p>      If you're fortunate enough to have a cider press, your      problems are over. Make a lot of cider. It can be frozen      (if you have a not-yet-full freezer) or canned by      processing 30 minutes in a hot-water bath. (It won't taste      as good as fresh cider, but it'll beat the stuffings out of      store-bought apple juice.) If you don't have a cider press,      find people who do. They'll probably be glad to work out a      reasonable barter.    </p>    <p>      There's a world of other possibilities, like drying (six      pounds of apple slices should dry in a 145°F oven in      four to 12 hours), and making apple jelly and apple      leather. You can even carve and sell apple-head dolls (they      wrinkle up beautifully when the heads dry), or just sell      some of the apples themselves.    </p>    <p>      No, when it comes to apples, you <em>can't</em> have too      much of a good thing. - <em>Susan Glaese</em>    </p>    <p>      Susan Glaese, who authored the compost article in this      issue, is MOTHER's head gardener.    </p>    <h3>      Gray-Water Purifiers    </h3>    <p>      I need help in locating manufacturers of what I refer to as      "gray-water purifiers," devices that process gray water      (some even process black water, I understand) to a      drinkable condition, thus enabling the water to be used      over and over again.    </p>    <p>      As one who's concerned with the possibility of polluted      groundwater (in addition to the high cost of drilling a      well), the gray-water purifying system seems like a logical      alternative. The possibility of combining this system with      a composting toilet is also an appealing option.    </p>    <p>      I'd appreciate any information you have concerning this      topic.    </p>        <p>      I know of no such equipment on the commercial market, and      if it were available for purchase, I'd recommend against it      in the strongest possible terms. Why? Let's start with      black water, or any household water that includes toilet      waste. First, human feces always contain "ordinary"      pathogenic bacteria and viruses that cause gastrointestinal      distress, and, depending on the circumstances, they may      contain life-threatening bacteria and viruses, such as      those responsible for typhoid, diptheria, polio, or worse.      Second, we humans have a habit of flushing down the toilet      various materials and fluids that contain toxic substances,      such as toxic heavy metals present in photographic      developing solutions and toxic organic compounds in      cleaning formulas, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Even if      you don't dispose of materials in this way, a visitor or      friend may do so.    </p>    <p>      In any event, using ordinary methods and care, no one can      safely and routinely disinfect and detoxify black water for      consumption. The theoretical methods that come to mind as      possibilities in <em>extreme</em> situations involve 1)      large amounts of energy to distill the water multiple      times, 2) large amounts of chemicals, especially chlorine,      3) large amounts of land for ponds or soil filtration, and      4) a laboratory for running chemical and bacteriological      tests every day.    </p>    <p>      Now, gray water - or any household water that doesn't      include toilet wastes - contains all the same      pathogenic and toxic components as black water, only in      lower concentrations. For example, both bath and laundry      water can contain pathogens washed from a body or clothing.    </p>    <p>      Having disappointed you, let me close with two thoughts.      First, with <em>great care</em> , you may be able to use      gray water - but never black water - on your      lawn or garden. As I pointed out in MOTHER NO. 82, I      strongly recommend against using gray water      <em>directly</em> on edible crops, particularly on ones      that will be eaten raw or slightly cooked. It's fine,      however, for corn, grains, fruit trees, and lawns. Second,      <em>never</em> try to store gray water inside or outside      your home for even an hour; use it promptly in the summer      and empty it into your septic tank or sewer in the winter.    </p>    <p>      For further information, you may want to contact the      Clivis-Multrum USA Company (14A Elliot St., Cambridge, MA      02138), makers and distributors of the original composting      toilet, and the New Alchemy Institute (237 Hatchville Rd.,      East Falmouth, MA 02536), which has done research on using      the nutrients in black and gray waters for aquaculture.      - <em>David Burmaster</em>    </p>    <p>      David Burmaster, Ph.D., is a consultant on surface- and      groundwater quality and hazardous-waste management. He is      the author of numerous articles and reports on these      topics.    </p>    <h3>      Outside Air    </h3>    <p>      I burn three to four cords of red oak and black locust in      my Ashley stove each winter as the only heat for my      60-year-old, woodframe home. Up until this year, all the      firewood has come from my property, but I'm going to have      to cut at least a cord elsewhere to get by this winter. The      expense and nuisance of finding firewood have me wondering      how I might cut down on the amount I burn.    </p>    <p>      Right now my heater uses the air inside my house for      burning, and I'm wondering how much wood I could save by      hooking the Ashley's air intake to the outside - so      that combustion air wouldn't have to come from the warm air      in my house.    </p>        <p>      My suggestion is to try outside air for a season (if it's      not too much trouble to install) and then decide. For some      houses and some people, it helps; for others, it doesn't.    </p>    <p>      It's very difficult to estimate how much wood you would      save by using outside air, but it's usually not much. The      primary benefit typically is increased comfort due to fewer      floor. level drafts. Since comfort is the primary objective      of using a wood heater, it may be worth it. However, I      wouldn't count on significant fuel savings. A switch to a      catalytic stove would probably have much more impact on      your fuel consumption, although catalytic stoves aren't      inexpensive. - <em>Jay Shelton</em>    </p>    <p>      Jay Shelton is the director of Shelton Energy Research and      the author of various books and articles about solid- fuel      heating.
