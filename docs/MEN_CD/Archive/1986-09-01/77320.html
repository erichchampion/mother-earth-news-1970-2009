                    <h5 id="byline">      by Susan Glaese    </h5>    <p>      <em>Making and using are the most important things you can      do to improve your garden.</em>    </p>        <p>      Rural author Wendell Berry once wrote of the farmer, "He      has seen the light lie down in the dung heap and rise again      in the corn." These words have sharply clarified for me the      agricultural life cycle - or, even better, <em>light      cycle</em> . Plants convert solar energy into food for      animals (ourselves included). Then the wastes from those      animals, along with dead plant and animal bodies, "lie down      in the dung heap," are composted, and "rise again in the      corn."    </p>    <p>      This cycle of light is the central reason that composting      is such an important link in organic food production: It      returns solar energy to the soil. In this context, such      common compost ingredients as onion skins, hair trimmings,      eggshells, vegetable parings, and even burnt toast are no      longer seen as garbage, but rather as sunlight on the move      from one form to another.    </p>    <p>      By making use of such substances, composting enables us to      have large amounts of "dung" for our gardens without      necessarily passing most of the ingredients through an      animal first. It also greatly speeds up the earth's own      soil-building processes so we can get the results in months      instead of centuries.    </p>    <p>      The benefits of using compost are so legion that it's no      exaggeration to say that it is <em>the</em> key to soil      fertility. The end product of composting is <em>humus</em>      , the broken-down organic matter that is the basis of soil      life. And the billions of microorganisms that are in a      single <em>teaspoon</em> of fertile soil perform numerous      functions. They change nutrients into a form that your      plants ran use . . . provide a sustained, ongoing flow of      that food . . . and bind earthen particles into small      aggregates, helping to build a friable soil.    </p>    <p>      There are other benefits of composting:    </p>    <p>      <em>Control of pH</em> . Acid or alkaline soil can lock up      many nutrients so that they're unavailable to plants. The      regular addition of compost rounds off such sharp edges,      helping to bring soil to the crop-favoring pH range of      between 6.5 and 7.5.    </p>    <p>      <em>Heat absorption</em> . Finished compost will help      darken most soils, helping them to better absorb heat from      sunlight. This can actually extend your spring and fall      growing seasons.    </p>    <p>      <em>Drainage, water retention, and aeration</em> . Imagine      the life of a root for a moment, ever tunneling in search      of water and food. If the soil is clayey, the roots will      have trouble making headway. They become shallow, never      reaching the food and water reserves deeper down. And their      oxygen supply is easily cut off in the tightly packed soil.    </p>    <p>      Sandy soil creates a different problem; it's like a long      stretch of good road with nowhere to get food and water.      Nutrients and moisture simply percolate down out of reach.    </p>    <p>      So we want it all - good drainage, good water      retention (even though the two sound almost contradictory),      <em>and</em> openness for the incorporation of air. Again,      humus is the cure-all. It opens up packed soils and binds      together loose ones. Acting somewhat like a sponge, humus      helps hold moisture, food, and air so plants can have      access to them at will.    </p>    <p>      <em>Nutrient retention</em> . Chemical fertilizers provide      quick-fix doses of three major nutrients: nitrogen (N),      phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Since such garden      additives are highly water-soluble, plants can take them up      quickly, but they can also be easily washed away by rain or      irrigation. In fact, it's estimated that from 25% to 85% of      the chemical nitrogen applied to soil and 15% to 20% of the      phosphorus and potassium are lost to leaching.    </p>    <p>      Humus holds those water-soluble nutrients inside itself,      keeping them safe from runoff and releasing them slowly to      plants. (Even better, the soil microorganisms in humus      release nutrients more slowly during cool weather -      when crops are growing more slowly - and most quickly      during warm weather, when plants are growing most      actively.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Free choice feeding</em> . The way in which roots and      humus directly interact is probably the most fascinating      argument that I know of for the use of compost. It's a      miraculous process whereby plants choose their own diet.    </p>    <p>      You may have seen the words cations exchange on a soil      test. Cations are positively charged molecules of different      minerals like ammonium, iron, potassium, magnesium, and      calcium. Since opposites attract, the negatively charged      molecules of humus (and, to a lesser extent, clay as well)      attract and hold the positive canons.    </p>    <p>      When a searching root comes along, surrounded by an aura of      positive hydrogen ions, it strikes up a friendly exchange      with the humus (or clay) molecules: The root trades its      hydrogen ions for the nutrient ions of its choice. Thus      humus allows plants to choose what nutrients they need.    </p>    <p>      <em>And more</em> . Compost also helps control nematodes      and soil diseases . . . attracts soil-building earthworms .      . . helps plants produce their own growth stimulators . . .      helps fix heavy metals and other toxins in the soil      (instead of letting them be absorbed by the crops) . . .      adds trace minerals to the soil . . . and makes plants      hardier and more resistant to insects and diseases. It can      even be used as a healing poultice on tree wounds!    </p>    <p>      Last, compost can be made virtually free at home, by      mimicking the earth's recycling system. Chemical      fertilizers, on the other hand, cost money and use      nonrenewable fossil fuels (both as ingredients and in their      manufacture).    </p>    <p>      <em>Composting requires nitrogen, carbon, air, water, mass,      and microorganisms.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Where    </h3>        <p>      Well, are you convinced? I hope so. Composting really is      the backbone of good horticulture.    </p>    <p>      If you are ready to start your own pile of black soil      magic, the first concern is <em>where</em> you'll build it.      When choosing a spot, take into account these suggestions:    </p>    <p>      1. Try to locate your pile near your garden - a      wheelbarrow loaded with compost is heavy.    </p>    <p>      2. If you're going to be importing some compost-building      ingredients by vehicle, try to build your pile in a spot      you can drive to.    </p>    <p>      3. Wetting the pile will be a lot easier if you locate near      a water source.    </p>    <p>      4. A good deciduous shade tree near the pile can provide      some shelter from heavy thunderstorms and excessively hot      summer sun, while it lets warmth-boosting fall and winter      light through. It'll even provide leaf material! However,      evergreens (which have acidic needles), walnuts (which      exude a toxin through their roots), and eucalyptuses (which      have resinous leaves) are not good choices.    </p>    <h3>      In What    </h3>    <p>      Now we need something to put your ingredients in. Actually,      a straight-sided pile can be constructed with no bin or      supports. That's a perfectly acceptable way to compost.    </p>    <p>      But it takes time to shape a freestanding pile; being able      to toss the makings into a container can really speed the      process along. In addition, if your neighbors live nearby,      they may voice aesthetic objections to a freestanding pile      of decomposing materials. In that case, you can compost      incognito by using an attractive homemade or commercial      bin. Privacy fencing (plant or wire) might also help shut      out the critical eyes.    </p>    <p>      The creative scrounger will find that numerous materials      make good bin buildings. Boards, poles, screen, wire, old      pallets, concrete blocks, snow fencing, and hay bales will      all serve well. At the other end of the spectrum are the      $70 to $200 commercial composters you can buy through      garden supply catalogs.    </p>    <p>      In the middle, between total scrounging and total spending,      are the two composters we recently designed at MOTHER EARTH      NEWS. (See the sidebar "Any Way You Stack It . . ." for      construction details.) The "quickie" version is a mobile      pen made out of hogwire panels. This low-cost model allows      you to use it to make a pile and then easily move the pen      when you want to start a new pile or turn the old one. The      "uptown" model is meant to be more aesthetically      acceptable, yet still entirely practical. Although you      could build it with just one bin (the design is basically      modular), you'll do better if you build more than one      enclosure so you can turn compost from one bin to the      other. Better still, build a three-bin version so you can      turn two half-decomposed "side" piles into the middle bin      to finish cooking!    </p>    <p>      Any pile, freestanding or contained, should be at least 3'      X 3' X 3' to insure that there's sufficient mass for the      composting process to take place. I find 4'-tall by 5'-wide      ones even better. The bottom of the pile should be exposed      to the earth, and the top should be covered with black      plastic or a waterproof tarp to protect it from extreme      rain or drying sun. Contained piles should also have enough      open spaces in their sides to allow for good air      circulation.    </p>    <h3>      DELUXE COMPOSTER    </h3>		    <h3>      ANY WAY YOU STACK IT...    </h3>    <p>      The great thing about organic decomposition is that it's      always ready to start without you. However, if you want to      be assured of consistently composted material on a regular      basis, you'll need to take the matter into your own hands      and provide a setting in which the breakdown process can      occur under the best conditions and with your supervision.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, compost doesn't ask much in the way of      accommodations . . . so, depending on how much you're      willing to spend, your bin can be as unassuming as a simple      wire enclosure, or as fancy as the covered "post-and-beam"      model featured in our photograph.    </p>    <p>      If you're short on time and not ready to spend much money      on a composter, the "quickie" version is right up your      alley. It'll take about $40 and less than two hours to put      together, and it's made of a 16'-long, 14"-wire stock panel      hacksawed into 48" X 52" sections and clipped together at      the corners with quick-connecting chain links. To ease the      chore of filling it up, one of the wire sections can be cut      in two, halfway up its 4' height, and similarly linked at      the horizontal split to make a hinged flap which you can      secure at the top with a couple of snap hooks.    </p>    <p>      Since the panels' wire openings are 2" X 8" at the bottom      and increase to 6" X 8" toward the top, it's necessary to      line the walls with cage fencing (or some other product      with openings no larger than 2" X 4"); this inner grid can      be secured to the outer with baling wire or leftover      strands from the trimmed-down panels. To put the lid on the      kettle, just invest a couple of bucks in a 5' X 7'      polyethylene tarp and some S-hooks or rope to keep the      heavy rain of your working pile. Then when it comes time to      start a new heap, simply open one corner of the enclosure,      remove it, and set it up at a different location.    </p>    <p>      The "uptown" model shown in the illustration costs      considerably more - perhaps as much as $200,      depending on where you get your materials - and is      nothing less than a weekend project. In return for this      investment, though, you'll get a sturdy and attractive      compost crib that's been specifically designed for ease of      use. Our version has two bins, though it could be built as      a single or a triple, depending upon your compost rotation      schedule. Its front doors hinge both down and outward, the      ventilated partition between the bins can be lowered in      stages, and the front center-posts fold down against the      ground; fully opened, with the framed covers flipped back      on their supports, each stall is surprisingly accessible      for routine turning.    </p>    <p>      Our illustration indicates the number and placement of      hinges, fasteners, hooks, and other hardware. The 4 X 4      posts should be sunk 2' into the ground if possible,      leaving 5' exposed at the front and 4' at the rear. All      posts are centered about 54" apart. The wall panels are 2 X      4s notched at the ends to make bolted-together half-lap      joints; they're secured to the posts with 40d spikes driven      into the wood and bent to form slip-out hook-and-eye      fasteners. Cut sections of dog pen wire are stapled to the      frames.    </p>    <p>      The tarp covers are framed in 2 X 2s, which are half-lap      jointed like the wall panels. Each lid has two support ribs      that are lapped and bolted in place. Wooden struts fastened      to the cover frames hold them up or support them when      they're flipped back, but normally they're just tied to      looped spikes fastened to the center-posts.    </p>    <p>      If you take the time to build either version now, you      should have a ready supply of valuable organic material      come next spring.    </p>    <h3>      Kosher and Nonkosher Materials    </h3>    <p>      So many types of organic matter can be composted that it's      almost easier to list what <em>shouldn't</em> be put in a      compost pile. Here's a partial list of what not to use:    </p>    <p>      <em>Cat feces.</em> While almost every other kind of animal      manure makes an excellent compost ingredient, cat feces can      contain a parasite ( <em>Toxoplasma</em> <em>gondii</em> )      or roundworm ( <em>Toxocara</em> <em>catty</em> ). Either      of these organisms can spread serious disease to pregnant      women, unborn babies, and children.    </p>    <p>      <em>Grease and fat</em> . OK in small amounts, but too much      will clog up the composting process.    </p>    <p>      <em>Coal, coal ashes, and barbecue briquettes.</em> These      have overly high amounts of iron and sulfur (and who knows      what else in the briquettes).    </p>    <p>      <em>Diseased plant matter.</em> Actually, you can place      diseased plants in the center of a compost pile that will      be prepared in the hot method - where temperatures      reach a pathogen-killing 140°F. Otherwise, burn them      before composting.    </p>    <p>      <em>Polyester, plastics, and other synthetics.</em> They      just don't rot.    </p>    <p>      <em>Urban floor sweepings.</em> In high-traffic areas,      these can contain as much as 500 parts per million of lead.    </p>    <p>      <em>Food preserved with BHT.</em> Recent research has shown      that even very small amounts of this antioxidant can alter      plant growth profoundly.    </p>    <p>      <em>Overly bulky or hard material.</em> Cornstalks,      sunflower stalks, nutshells, sticks thicker than a pencil,      large bones, and oyster and clam shells should be shredded      or pulverized before composting. If you can't do that, put      them in a long-range pile of their own or burn what you can      and add the ashes.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sludge.</em> Commercially reprocessed sludge is an      increasingly popular soil amendment and is almost certainly      pathogen-free, but I'm concerned about the heavy metals and      insecticides it may contain.    </p>    <p>      And what are good compost makings? Well, for starters, how      about these:    </p>    <p>      <em>Plant residues (preferably nonsprayed)</em> , such as      kitchen and garden wastes, weeds, grass clippings, leaves      (go light on those from eucalyptuses, walnuts, and      evergreens), straw, hay, hedge clippings, seaweed, aquatic      plants, and green manure crops.    </p>    <p>      <em>Commercial wastes</em> , such as buckwheat hulls, rice      hulls, molasses-making residue, spent hops,      fruit-processing wastes, commercial fishing scraps, lake      dredgings, sawdust, feathers, wood ashes (in moderation),      utility-company tree trimmings, and vegetable or dairy      wastes from grocery stores.    </p>    <p>      <em>Home wastes</em> , like eggshells, hair, wool scraps,      etc.    </p>    <p>      <em>Manures</em> from horses, fowl, cows, pigs, sheep, etc.      These are even better if they're mixed with straw (i.e.,      used stall bedding).    </p>        <h3>      The Six Essentials    </h3>    <p>      Once you've assembled lots of appropriate organic matter      from the "compost pile shopping list" above, you're just      about ready to start cooking. The funny thing, though, is      there is no <em>one</em> way to make compost -      indeed, there are almost as many methods as there are      experts to advocate them.    </p>    <p>      It's like baking bread: There are thousands of different      recipes, but all of them have in common some basic      practices and vital main ingredients. So before you build      that long-awaited heap, let's quickly review the six      essentials of successful composting:    </p>    <p>      <em>Nitrogen</em> . For a compost to cook properly and to      have maximum value for plants, it needs nitrogen, the      leaf-growth-promoting element. Good sources of N are pig,      chicken, sheep, horse, and cow manure (ranked in descending      amounts of nitrogen) . . . fresh <em>green</em> plant waste      (especially legumes) . . . kitchen wastes . . . blood,      bone, cottonseed, hoof, horn, and alfalfa meals (readily      available from garden supply centers, but somewhat costly)      . . . and urine. This last nitrogen source may be animal or      - if you're not made squeamish by the thought -      human. Indeed, "household liquid activator," as human urine      has been dubbed, is practically sterile, available to      everyone, and a perfect nitrogenous compost catalyst. (You      can collect it in a lidded bucket - a chamber pot,      our forebears called it - and dilute it with water,      then add it once the pile is <em>hot</em> . A week's urine      should provide plenty of N for a good-sized pile.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Carbon</em> . The vast bulk of any compost pile should      be carbonaceous material: dried leaves, hay, straw,      partially dried garden gleanings, shredded stalks -      almost any dried organic matter. This is the key      humus-building material and the substance that binds      nitrogen (an otherwise ephemeral element) into the compost.    </p>    <p>      <em>Air</em> . Although organic matter <em>can</em> decay      anaerobically (without oxygen), it will do so much quicker,      retain more nutrient value, and - for that matter      - cook with much less stink if it composts      aerobically (with oxygen). To provide good airflow to a      pile, you should, if possible, place thick, hollow material      like cornstalks and sunflower stalks at the bottom of a      pile. Also, be sure that any compost bins or pens have      perforated sides.    </p>    <p>      Once the pile is built, you can try poking holes in      numerous places with poles or branches to increase aeration      - although I've never noticed that this technique      made much difference. You can try using a "compost      aerator," a pole with a flap like a toggle bolt that opens      up when you pull it up out of your pile (available from      garden supply companies). I've never used one myself. Or      you can just break down and use the age-old method of      adding oxygen to a pile: turning it. Periodically, take a      garden fork and turn the pile - upside down and      inside out - over on an adjacent spot.    </p>    <p>      <em>Water</em> . A compost pile needs moisture to cure.      However, too much water will drown out the air and stop the      process. The ideal heap, then, is damp but not soggy.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mass</em> . As pointed out earlier, a compost pile      needs to have at least a cubic yard of bulk to heat up      properly. And the bigger the better - up to a point.      A pile can hardly be too long or wide, but one that is      <em>too tall</em> (say over five feet high) may mash down      and squeeze out air.    </p>    <p>      <em>Beneficial microorganisms</em> . These are the guys who      actually do all the work. You can buy beneficial bacteria      packets to inoculate your compost, but these little fellows      are pretty much everywhere and will thrive if you give them      an environment they like. One simple way to inoculate your      piles for free is to occasionally sprinkle some good garden      soil - or compost from a previous pile - on the      one you're constructing.    </p>    <p>      <em>If your pile doesn't heat up, something's wrong.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Putting It All Together    </h3>    <p>      Now that you know the six essential ingredients of a good      compost pile, you need to know how to combine them. The      basic technique is simply to alternate layers of      nitrogenous and carbonaceous materials. If your pile is all      carbon or all nitrogen, your bacteria's diet will be too      far out of whack for them to do their job.    </p>    <p>      The ideal carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is about 25 to 1, but      you'd need all sorts of time and charts to figure out how      to achieve that precise ratio out of the materials you may      have on hand. It's easier - and perfectly effective      - to just take some ingredients from the carbon list      and some from the nitrogen list and layer them,      experimenting with proportions until you find what works      for you.    </p>    <p>      In a nutshell, then: 1) Lay down some stalky material,      preferably on bare soil you have forked up some to allow      easier passage for bacteria and earthworms. 2) Fork on a      layer of carbonaceous material. 3) Fork on a layer of      nitrogenous matter. Each layer - N or C -      should be about two to eight inches thick. And fluff it up      as you add it to promote airflow. 4) Repeat steps 2 and 3      until you've finished building your pile. Sprinkle on a      spadeful or two of soil or cured compost occasionally, and      if your materials seem dry, spray on some water      periodically as you work. 5) Cover the pile with a      waterproof tarp to protect it.    </p>    <p>      I mentioned that you'll have to experiment to find the best      ratio of materials for you. One of my "old reliable"      combinations, if you'd like to try it, is alternating in a      5-5-2 pattern: a five-inch layer of green matter, a      five-inch layer of dry matter, and a two-inch layer of      manure. But - contrary to some opinions - good      compost piles can be made with all vegetative matter and      <em>no</em> manure. Just make sure you have enough nitrogen      (here's where something like blood meal or human urine is      invaluable).    </p>    <h3>      If It Didn't Work    </h3>    <p>      If all goes well, in about four or five days the interior      of your compost pile should have heated up. Indeed, before      long a hand poked inside the heap will get uncomfortably      hot.    </p>    <p>      If that happens, congratulations! Your compost is cooking!      If your pile doesn't heat up, something's wrong. First      check to see if the pile is <em>too wet</em> or <em>too      dry</em> . If it's too soggy, turn it, adding more dry      material as you do. If it's too dry, wet it.    </p>    <p>      Assuming the pile is properly moistened and isn't too      compressed for good air circulation, your problem is that      the compost mixture needs <em>more nitrogen</em> . Turn the      pile, incorporating more nitrogenous material as you do so.    </p>    <p>      You may have a diferent problem - namely, the cooking      mound will smell like ammonia. In that case, you've got      <em>too much nitrogen</em> . So turn the pile, adding more      carbonaceous matter.    </p>    <h3>      Fast, Medium, or Slow    </h3>    <p>      There's one last step to making compost: turning the pile.      And here you have some choices. If you want to get your      compost quickly, you'll turn the pile every time its most      intense heat (104° to 170°F) starts to drop -      about every three to five days. That will add more oxygen      and kick up the process. Keep that up and you should have      finished compost in two months or less. If all the      ingredients have been finely shredded, thinly layered, and      turned every three days, it's even possible to make usable      compost in two weeks!    </p>    <p>      If you want your compost in a medium amount of time, turn      the pile approximately six weeks after you make it and      again six weeks later. Your humus should be ready four to      six months after you started it.    </p>    <p>      And if you're long on patience and short on turning time,      just leave the mound alone. Such a slow pile should be      ready to use after a year (or even a little longer).    </p>    <p>      Time is not the only consideration here - there are      raging debates about whether "quick" or "slow" compost is      better. Since quick-cured piles get well above the      pathogen-killing temperature of 140°F, they're the way      to go if you want to compost diseased materials (or kill      weed seeds).    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, slow-pile advocates claim that      cold-cured compost (which cooks at around 100°F)      retains more nutrients.    </p>    <p>      So relax, dig in, and don't be afraid to experiment.      Whichever way you compost, you'll be making the best soil      builder your garden could have. You'll also be      participating in the light cycle that connects all life on      this planet-plant, animal, and even human. As Leandre      Poisson has pointed out, we ourselves are "light's ultimate      art."    </p>    <p>      PHOTOGRAPHS BY WESTSTAR PHOTOGRAPHIC    </p>    <h3>      Super Compost Books    </h3>    <p>      <em>The Rodale Guide to Composting,</em> $14.95 postpaid      from Rodale Press, 33 E.
