                    <h5 id="byline">      By Paula Thompson    </h5>    <p>      <em>They set out in search of a new beginning.</em>    </p>    <p>      Many people now in their 30s and early 40s came to      northwest Arkansas 10 to 15 years ago, following a dream or      escaping a nightmare. Like other waves of immigrants before      them, they set out in search of inexpensive land and a new      beginning.    </p>		<h3>Why They Came</h3>    <p>      Despite his degree in industrial engineering from Georgia      Tech, Bob Jordan chose to live in the country. He found      Vermont winters too hard on southern bones, and according      to the map he consulted, Arkansas had less population per      square mile anyway. In 1974, at age 29, Bob came "to settle      down."    </p>    <p>      Barbara Jordan wanted to live someplace warmer and prettier      than the south side of Chicago, where she grew up. In 1971,      at age 21, she discovered rural Arkansas and "fell in      love." She stayed.    </p>    <p>      After a 1972 visit to friends here, Wyit and Lillian Wright      bought 40 isolated acres. Two more years at their Tucson      jobs, teaching and managing a satellite tracking station,      paid for their land: "When we moved onto it at last, in      search of freedom and tranquility, we felt like a retired      couple in our late 20s."    </p>    <p>      Bill Brown, a corporate headhunter in Memphis, read      <em>Future Shock</em> the year he turned 30. He experienced      it the morning after Martin Luther King Jr. was      assassinated in Memphis. That day, Bill and his wife,      Jeannette, began planning their family's flight from the      city.    </p>    <p>      Gregg Thomas (1973), Loretta Shelton (1975), and Mike      Stephenson (1975) all came to learn about agriculture.      Nancy followed Mike from a New Orleans society family. She      was "into health foods" and imagined farming would be      "heaven." All were in their early 20s.    </p>		<h3>What They Found</h3>    <p>      "Despite all our reading and planning, we were ill      prepared," Bill said, shaking his head ruefully. "My      corporate skills didn't apply in the new context. The first      winter, I bought a woodstove because it was part of our      lifestyle image. Of course I didn't have a chain saw, an      axe, a truck, or any place to cut wood, but I had a      woodstove."    </p>    <p>      The urban escapists learned a lot of things the hard way.      They bought hundreds of acres of inexpensive land, only to      find that it had neither water nor access roads -      that even minimal utilities were years away. Wyit developed      a rule of thumb for friends looking for acreage: "Buy a      place with at least an old house on it. That means somebody      once was able to live there."    </p>    <p>      As families grew and resources didn't, the stress mounted      on many formerly carefree immigrants. "The early years were      paradise on Mossy Creek," Wyit recounted with a grin. "The      biggest decision we had to make in a day was where to go      swimming that afternoon. There were lots of parties,      minimal pressures, good times. We had a strong sense of      community."    </p>    <p>      "We all had the same needs," Lillian explained. "We have a      well-established food-buying club in the Fayetteville      Co-op. But there aren't many of us left who started out      with it."    </p>        <p>      The sense of being in the same boat sustained them for a      while. In many places, a gathering of 50 people for an      afternoon potluck or cooperative workday wasn't unusual.      But varying degrees of success began creating problems in      paradise.    </p>    <p>      "Our business was going well, but when we wanted to go out      to dinner and a movie, we couldn't think of anyone with      money enough to come with us," Wyit remembered sadly. "It      got kind of lonesome, being the only ones with any      discretionary funds."    </p>    <p>      At first, many took pride in the primitiveness of their      living conditions. The Wrights mentioned a neighboring      family who bragged about getting through one whole year on      only $500. But the cost was higher in the end. The family      broke up. "The wife is a CPA in Tulsa now." An apprentice      Yuppie making up for lost time, they imagine.    </p>		<h3>What They Did</h3>    <p>      Gregg and Loretta developed and managed a 400-acre farm at      Cass on salaries, but watched their friends grubbing and      losing ground. "All your time is spent surviving and      worrying," Gregg said. "It grinds you down. Pretty soon,      you're fighting over where to plant the carrots."    </p>    <p>      The people who stuck it out, adapting rather than      abandoning their dreams, often turned to entrepreneurship      as an alternative to a town job or a supplement to farming.    </p>    <p>      Bob and Barbara started with one hive of bees. When they      built up their own apiary, they formed coalitions with      other beekeepers to service fruit growers' pollination      needs. For the past five years, they've sustained an      average of 120 hives, marketing tons of Spring Fever Farm      honey through direct and mail-order sales.    </p>    <p>      Mossy Creek Woodworks started making "practical things,"      but the Wrights quickly found that toys sold better. By      their second year, they had a stable income from a line of      wooden toys taken to craft fairs, Silver Dollar City, and      local outlets. After the arrival of a son took Lillian out      of the business, Wyit hired extra people to make the toys.      He turned his attention to wholesale marketing through such      outlets as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of      American Folk Art in New York. A new interest in computers      helps him keep up with accounts as far-flung as Alaska and      Puerto Rico.    </p>    <p>      Loretta and Gregg's Ozark Horticultural Services offers      consulting, landscaping services, and blueberry plants. "I      knew about growing things," Loretta said. "What I had to      learn about was business."    </p>    <p>      Nancy's farming "heaven" came crashing down "like a lead      balloon the first strawberry harvest season. It was awful.      I have a picture of me sitting under a tent, nursing my      baby and trying to deal with pick-your-own customers. I      didn't think I'd survive!" For a city-bred woman, it was a      heavy dose of rural reality.    </p>        <p>      After an initial financial disaster, Bill took a job as a      community organizer based 26 miles from his home in Busch.      His first annual salary in Arkansas equalled his previous      year's taxes. "You have to simplify your economic demands      and expectations, or you have to leave," he said flatly.      "The Ozarks can be a very unforgiving context."    </p>		<h3>The Compromises</h3>    <p>      The Wrights came with the goal of "voluntary simplicity,"      but, Lillian added quickly, "we chose this house because it      had indoor plumbing."    </p>    <p>      After the birth of their fourth child, Barbara came to a      "gradual, disappointing realization that life would be      easier in town." Their oldest was school age, and the      small, rustic farmhouse was too crowded and stressful for      the family. When the highway department paid for a right of      way through their land, they bought a house in      Fayetteville, though Bob continues to work at the farm.    </p>    <p>      "I always thought I wanted to live and work at the same      place, but I find I'm more productive with the two      separated. There are fewer distractions," he added with a      mischievous smile at his nearly new daughter.    </p>    <p>      The age of children appears to be a determining factor in      changes of residence and lifestyle. The Wrights have loved      their isolation on Mossy Creek but are now considering a      move to Fayetteville. Lillian is tired of driving several      miles of rugged dirt trail and 50-plus round-trip miles of      highway to Fayetteville for Josh's preschool and Suzuki      lessons.    </p>    <p>      "You grow up when you have to take responsibility for      someone else," Lillian summed up. "We chose him. We owe      him."    </p>    <h3>      ON THE ROAD TO THE OZARKS    </h3>    <p>      Each wave of immigrants worries about the effects of the      next wave of immigrants - that they will spoil the      unspoiled . . . uncomfortably increase the competitor for      opportunity ... re-create the problems everyone came here      to escape . . . destroy the refuge they seek.    </p>    <p>      But one urban escapee from the late '60s has some respect      for many of the Ozark newcomers. "The escaping in-migrants      today are more sophisticated than we were, better armed      with money and tools. When they flee the cities, they're      set up for it. They'll probably make it, too! From my own      experience, the people who realized their dream 10 years      ago were the ones who didn't act impulsively. They      researched an area before they bought land, and they      <em>paid</em> for the land <em>before</em> they moved.      That's the best advice I could give anyone planning to come      here now."    </p>    <p>      Ozarkers have always prided themselves on being      individualistic, free, unwilling to march to anyone's time      but their own or take anyone else's word for how life      should be lived. They tend to stick to their own business      when allowed to do so. This traditional tolerance appeals      to highly divergent types: gentlefolk, militant      fundamentalists, bigots, and the targets of their bigotry.      All seek the benign neglect of the backwoods.    </p>    <p>      But how long will it be possible to maintain that kind of      elbow room? The number of people per square mile in 10      northern counties of the Arkansas Ozarks (Baxter, Benton,      Boone, Carroll, Madison, Marion, Newton, Searcy, Stone,      Washington) increased 156% in 20 years, from 25 in 1950 to      39 in 1980. In the three most populous counties, density      has more than doubled in the past 50 years (Baxter 289%,      Benton 222%, Washington 256%).    </p>    <p>      As the population continues to increase, the conflicting      aims of these diverse groups may focus into sharper      contrast. If the right to stretch your arm ends at the      other fellow's nose, the next wave of Ozark immigrants may      have to play it closer to the vest than their predecessors      ever dreamed of.    </p><p>- Paula Thompson</p>    <h3>A Decade Later</h3>    <p>      After 10 years, give or take, how do they feel about their      Ozarks experience?    </p>    <p>      "We have no regrets," Loretta said, "but we've evolved.      It's nice to live in a pretty place, but there's no time to      enjoy it when you're scrabbling for an existence. I don't      want to be an old lady on welfare, so I have to do      something about it now."    </p>        <p>      The something was to accept a job with a horticultural firm      in Australia, doing pretty much what she's been doing but      for a healthy, guaranteed salary.    </p>    <p>      Involved for the past two years in Arkansas location      filmmaking, Gregg hopes he'll be able to continue his new      direction in Australia. Once again, they're emigrating for      a new beginning.    </p>    <p>      "Our life has been almost too good, too easy here," Wyit      said with a twinge of guilt. "Our business has financed our      lifestyle - never driven us. As crafters we can plan      ahead, work when we want to. Your own business allows you      control. We'll always want freedom and privacy wherever we      live, but after 10 years a change is welcome. We'll be glad      to be nearer a library, places to eat out, friends,      playmates for josh. But we'll still evaluate ourselves by      our own standards."    </p>    <p>      Barbara's eyes glow intensely when she talks about her      Ozark odyssey. "Life <em>is</em> better in the country. I      miss it, body and soul. We came as a result of our need to      get back in touch with the earth, with ourselves. That need      hasn't changed. A lot of people who left are only trying to      make enough money to get back here."    </p>    <h3>      Holding On to the Dream    </h3>    <p>      "The gentlefolk back-to-the-landers," as MOTHER once styled      them, have found many paths to their dreams. A major      commonality is the persistent sense of community, of      networking, of intentionally chosen extended families. Some      of that can be traced to common experience, some even to a      ghetto mentality, but a great deal more must be charged to      the nature of these gentle revolutionaries. They work hard,      they care for each other, they still believe the world can      be improved by demanding less and contributing more. They      make good neighbors, and they are good children for an      increasingly strained Mother Earth.    </p><hr />    <p>      <em>Paula Thompson, an Ozark native, is a writer, an      award-winning actress, a child-development specialist, and      a blueberry farmer.</em>    </p>
