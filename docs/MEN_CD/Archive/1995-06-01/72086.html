                    <p>      <strong>Country Skills</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Rekindle an age of cheap, efficient woodworking      tools in your home.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Robert Houghton    </h5>        <p>      The average construction site is full of hard-working men      and women sweating over their craft while attached like      marionettes to the electrical grid. You'll see them waving      thousands of dollars worth of candy-col ored power tools      over their work, while trailing miles of copper gossamer      back to the nearest generating station. Ask one of them to      drill an oak plank two inches beyond the reach of their      longest extension cord, however, and they become as      productive as a three-year-old bruising grass with a toy      mower. Those that quick-draw a battery-powered tool in      response to such a challenge will lose their snugness after      the tenth or eleventh hole.    </p>    <p>      We seem to have forgotten what some of history's best      craftspeople had no choice but to understand: The right      hand tool, with a generous application of human muscle and      skill, does the job quickly and well. A hand tool is on      intimate terms with the material it works in ways that a      shrieking, woodshredding, finger-risking power tool cannot      approach. Despite the trend toward "more power," a hand      tool is always a cheaper-and often more      efficient-alternative to the plugin come-latelys.      I've equipped my own toolbox with a few secret weapons that      make me a more productive, perhaps even more graceful,      worker than my plugged-in partners.    </p>    <p>      The need for a board to pass daylight is fundamental in      construction, and nothing bores kilowatt-free holes through      wood better than a brace and bit. Originating in fifteenth      century Europe, shaped like a set of handlebars, the modern      carpenter's brace with spring-loaded split jaws and ratchet      was introduced in 1864. By pushing on the brace's pivoting      "head" end and turning the middle, the carpenter can rotate      a cutting bit fixed in its "chuck" end continuously, and      with tremendous force. A ratchet allows the brace to be      used in close quarters where it can't be turned full      circle.    </p>    <p>      Although a brace will accept any drill, an auger bit with a      lead screw which pulls the cutting edge into the wood is      most efficient. I always keep a few augers in the common      sizes up to one inch in my toolbox, along with an expansion      bit that can be adjusted to drill any size hole from one to      three inch diameters.    </p>    <p>      Using a brace and bit is as simple as lining up the bit,      holding the head steady in one hand-if possible      against the body-and turning the brace with the other      hand, as if cranking an old-fashioned ice cream freezer.      Don't push on the bit, but allow the lead screw to feed the      cutting edge into the wood. Take a few turns in reverse now      and then to clear chips from the hole. To avoid splintering      the exit, either back the work with a piece of scrap, or      drill until the lead screw begins to break through, then      finish from the other side.    </p>    <p>      A pushdrill is ideal for fast, small holes, such as those      you need for starting screws and nails. It uses a      spring-loaded spiral shaft to rotate special "drill points"      when you apply a downward pressure to the handle. When      released, the handle springs back, ready for another      cutting stroke. A carpenter hard at work with a pushdrill      looks like he's churning butter. Since its bits are stored      in the handle, my own pushdrill imparts an aura of      organized efficiency to my efforts. Onlookers no longer      catch me rooting through 50 pounds of tools looking for a      tiny twist drill. There is absolutely no trick to using a      pushdrill; extend your forefinger along its shaft as a      guide, start slowly, then pump like you're rubbing two      sticks together to make a fire in the Arctic.    </p>    <p>      If you imagine a pushdrill on steroids, about 28 inches      long fully extended, you have pictured a Yankee      screwdriver. It uses a similar spring-loaded spiral action      to turn the standard array of screwdriving bits. A      carpenter wielding a Yankee is impressive, like a military      officer brandishing his saber, and effective; a stroke or      two will drive most screws. It has a switch which reverses      the driving action, or locks the shaft for use as a      ratchet-action screwdriver. A well-used Yankee can      easily keep up with an electric screw gun in soft materials      such as drywall, but since you are able to control the      speed of rotation with downward pressure, it is ideal for      driving screws in finish work as well. A Yankee paired with      a pushdrill is unsurpassed for setting hinges or cabinet      hardware.    </p>        <p>      I recommend using a Yankee with either Phillips head or      square Robertson drive screws that make it easy to keep the      driving bit centered. In hardwood or finish work, drill a      pilot hole which is approximately the diameter of the screw      shank m inus the threads. If you're driving screws into      seasoned oak or other really tough stuff, it helps to      lubricate the screws with a smear of bar or liquid soap.      Driving the screws takes no more skill than putting the      point of the screw on the mark and pushing. Use long, firm      strokes, and finish carefully to avoid over-driving.    </p>    <p>      The true measure of a carpenter's productivity, of course,      is how quickly a large pile of shavings can be produced. An      important, often-overlooked advantage enjoyed by the      human-powered tool user is the ability to choose the      size of those shavings. The choice between fast, rough work      (large, coarse shavings) and fine, finish work (paper-thin      shavings) rarely occurs to the plugged-in      practitioner, but judiciously made, can make for a faster,      better jot).    </p>    <p>      Where you desire quick wood removal, and where close (+/-      1/8") is close enough, a hewing hatchet will make the chips      fly Where a conventional hand ax has a doublebeveled      cutting edge, a hewing hatchet is sharpened to only one      bevel, with the opposite face left fiat. With some      practice, a carpenter can easily follow a straight line or      convex shapes with the flat side of the blade. You can      carve concave shapes with the beveled side. It is an ideal      tool for "taking off the high spots" in stick framing.    </p>        <p>      A good, sharp edge and a measured approach are necessary to      use a hewing hatchet. Trying to lop off too much in one      swipe will often tear grain and take the cut off the line.      Instead, use short, controlled chops to work down the line,      while supporting the work on a solid surface that won't      damage the blade in case of a misplaced swing. Stand or      kneel so that a swing which misses or glances off the work      will also miss your knees. Wearing a threecornered hat and      knickers is optional for this type of work.    </p>    <p>      A low-angle, adjustable-mouth block plane is useful for a      variety of more finished work, with accuracy down to the      nearest sixty-fourth of an inch. About seven inches long,      most block planes have their blades set at an angle of 20      degrees; the low-angle variety places the blade at only 12      degrees, which minimizes the tendency to tear the wood      grain. The "mouth" of the plane can be adjusted close to      the plane iron for fine work, or moved back to create a      large opening to pass thicker shavings for rougher work.    </p>    <p>      Sharpness for a block plane, as with any tool, is a virtue.      Before using the plane, adjust the mouth opening according      to how much wood you want the plane to take in one bite.      For the finest work, the merest sliver of light should be      visible between the cutting edge and the plane mouth. So      adjusted, a plane can cut end-grain wood glassy smooth,      slice through knots without tearing the surrounding grain,      and remove long grain shavings so thin they are as      transparent as onionskin. Open the mouth up to about an      eighth of an inch, and a block plane can remove the      thirty-second part of an inch at one swipe, with the clean      sound of a fingernail drawn across canvas.    </p>        <p>      Even sharp planes take a considerable amount of muscle to      work. Old molding planes were designed with a knob on the      front for hitching the tool to a team of carpenter's      apprentices. Assuming you work alone, use your upper body,      take as long a stroke as possible, and line up each swath      carefully before putting your back into it. Rub a little      paraffin or wax on the plane's bottom to reduce friction.      Hold the plane at a slight angle to the length of the cut      as you work to slice the wood fibers on the diagonal. If      shavings clog the mouth, either open it up or draw in the      iron.    </p>    <p>      For much of the fine work normally relegated to a heathen      belt sander-removing saw marks, smoothing glue lines or      torn grain-I recommend one of the simplest tools of      all: the cabinet scraper. Essentially nothing more than a      flat piece of tool steel, its secret is in its sharpening.      Viewed in magnified cross-section, a scraper has a T-shaped      edge. The "ears" of the T are actually burrs formed by      first filing the edge perfectly square, then rubbing a      steel burnishing tool, or the back of a gouge, at an angle      along the scraper's edge. Use the scraper by holding it at      about a 60° angle to the work with both hands, thumbs      toward the middle, and ...scraping. It should produce      feather-fine shavings, not dust. When it produces only      crumbs, it's time to reburnish.    </p>    <p>      Learning to work with hand tools may be easier than      acquiring them. The neighborhood hardware store might have      a few, and some are available through specialty catalogs.      Have patience, and many of them will turn up at flea      markets, antique stores, and garage sales. I looked lot      years before I bought my trusty hewing hatchet for a few      dollars from a furniture dealer. Inspect an old tool      carefully. Handles must be secure. Any moving parts should      work freely and show little wear. Cutting edges must be      free from rust pitting. You can easily clean decades of      grime from wooden han dles and knobs with a rag moistened w      it h a little paint stripper. Also, 2/0 steel wool and WD40      will remove surface rust.    </p>    <p>      A few dabs of oil on moving parts, a little linseed oil      rubbed into wooden handle now and then, some occasional      sharpening, and a hand tool will last generation,.      Oldtimers used to build elaborate tool cases with ingenious      hold-down systems for each tool to secure its wood and      steel from damaging contact with others. To protect my own      hand tools, I wrap each one in a piece of canvas.    </p>    <p>      Of course, I do use power tools. But I prefer them for the      repetitive, brutish task, at which they excel. When my      fingers wrap around a hand tool, I enjoy my fraternity with      a long heritage of carpenters and cab inet      makers-through my pride in the crap, our common      material, and particularly through the tools themselves. My      brace was first my great-grandfather's; my planes were his      son's; my hewing hatchet belonged to an "E.W," then an      "A.R.," probably before my great-great-grandfather was out      of diaper,. As the chips fly, the shavings curl, and the      steel sings in my hands, I know I am hearthe same tune that      these men enjoyed, and dancing the same jig over the work      those many craftspeople whose capabilities could be      measured in the keenness of their gaze, the strength of      their arms, the steadi ness of their hands, and not by a      tangled length of copper.    </p>
