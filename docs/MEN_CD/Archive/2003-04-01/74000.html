                    <h2 id="subtitle">      <em>Consider your Choices</em>    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      By K.C. Compton Illustration by Brian Orr and Karen      Rooman    </h5>        <p>      <em>I</em>s your hair thinning in all the wrong places?      <em>Take Viri-Locks twice a day and say goodbye forever to      male pattern baldness.</em> Has halitosis made you a social      outcast? <em>BreathLess could be just what the doctor      ordered to sweeten your breath, save your teeth and change      your life.</em> No longer the life of the party? Hooo,      <em>boy. You may have Festive Activity Disorder (FAD).</em>      Ask your doctor if MoodBGone is right for you.    </p>    <p>      People who pay attention to print and broadcast ads      probably are convinced that a prescription drug exists to      cure any ill-even illnesses they didn't realize they      had. The same consumer might conclude that herbal medicines      are worthless-or dangerous, in fact, if the knitted      brow of the television news anchor is any indication. "A      <em>new study reveals St. John's wort no more effective      than a placebo in treating depression . . . "</em>    </p>    <p>      Most news anchors missed the revelation in that same study      that the prescription drug Zoloft also was no more      effective than a placebo. They didn't follow up the story      to discover that the study itself is now on trial, its      protocol questioned even by one of the leading scientists      who helped initiate it.    </p>    <p>      Much larger concerns about pharmaceutical medicines growl      and huff outside the studio door, but few members of the      mainstream media seen able to tear themselves away from the      party line (pharmaceutical drugs good, Herbs weird) long      enough to investigate.    </p>    <p>      The issue isn't whether the best choice is synthetic      pharmaceuticals or natural herbs-the answer to that      question is as individual as the compounds and the      illnesses being considered. The issue is why the American      public can't get its hands on enough well researched,      unbiased information to even make informed choices.    </p>    <p>      In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration decided to allow      pharmaceutical companies to advertise prescription drugs      using" their specific names and the conditions they treat.      And the rush was em: In 2001, according to a recent article      in The <em>New York</em> Times, the ding companies spent      $19.1 billion on promotional campaigns, including $ 2.7      billion-yes, billion-for advertising aimed      directly at you and me, not physicians. The article quoted      a report from the U.S. General Accounting Office stating      that spending on consumer-directed adversities rose at a      far greater rate than spending on drug research. In the      future. we may not have many new treatments for disease,      but we can count on lots of new, great-looking television      and Internet ads. Stay tuned.    </p>    <p>      Some of this advertising has paved the way for frank and      helpful doctor-patient discussions. Consumers pay attention      to these ads; in fact, according to a 1998 studysponsored      by <em>Prevention</em> magazine with the U.S. Food and Drug      Administration, an estimated 61 million patients talked      with their doctors about a medical condition after seeing a      drug advertisement. Unfortunately, ads and news report,      rarely provide enough clear information and are sometimes      downright deceptive. Investigators for the General      Accounting Office recently reported that some drug      companies lave repeatedly disseminated misleading ads for      prescription drugs, even after being cited lot- violations.      That leaves only physicians, already over-worked, to answer      the questions created by advertising claims.    </p>    <p>      Doctors themselves give this advertising mixed reviews. A      recent FDA survey of 500 physicians reported that 40      percent of doctors surveyed said drug companies'      advertising of medicines to consumers had a positive impact      on their patients. But a nearly equal amount-33      percent-disagreed, and said the ads' effects were      negative. Among the criticisms were that the ads sometimes      prompt patients to ask for unnecessary prescriptions and      that the ads confused the relative risks and benefits of      medicines.    </p>    <p>      And the physicians themselves are not immune to pressures      from the pharmaceutical industry. A study quoted in the      <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> said      that doctors' interactions with drug company      representatives began during medical school and continued      at a rate of about four times a month. The study concluded      that these visits from phannaceutical representatives      resulted in increased prescription rates of the sponsor's      medications, and with "nonrational prescribing," meaning,      the drug prescribed wasn't necessarily the best suited to      treat the condition. The good news is, 81 percent of us who      asked about conditions we learned of from ads actually did      have the condition. The bad news is, the drugs we were      offered weren't necessarily the best medicine-just      the best-advertised medicine.    </p>    <p>      Buried in the landslide of advertising dollars is the      crucial fact that our pantries are full of foods that can      help maintain our health-sometimes we don't need      drugs in the first place. When we do fall ill, many safe,      relatively inexpensive, natural options exist to treat our      conditions. Humans have always had to deal with catarrhs      and fevers of unknown origin, ordinary aches and pains, the      side effects of overindulgence and the cyclical maladies      that accompany being male or female. Throughout hundreds of      generations we have used what nature provided to foster our      health and to treat our ailments.    </p>    <p>      Some of these treatments were no more effective than those      you and I might make up off the top of our heads. But many      traditional herbal remedies have passed the test of time      and deserve to be put on a front shelf in our medicine      cabinets (see "Herbal Remedies You Can Trust," Page 92).      This is not to say that synthetics are never useful but      simply that they aren't the only game in town. There's not      a lot of gold in them thar' herbs, since they often can't      be patented, so they're minimally-if at      all-studied, tested and advertised. The media      generally ignore them-and only the most motivated      consumers ferret out the facts about what ought to be as      natural as a walk in the garden.    </p>    <p>      "The pharmaceutical drug industry spends between $8,000 and      $13,000 per year <em>per physician</em> to promote their      products," says James Duke, Ph.D., one of the world's      foremost authorities on medicinal plants. Recently retired      from a 30-year career with the U.S. Department of      Agriculture, Duke holds a doctorate in botany and has done      extensive fieldwork, which inspired his passionate advocacy      of herbal medicines-and an almost equally passionate      outrage over the promotion of expensive, often ineffective      and sometimes toxic synthetic drugs.    </p>    <h3>      IS GARLIC RIGHT FOR YOU?    </h3>    <p>      "A hundred times a day the television tells you to ask your      doctor if expensive Brand X is `right for you,"'Duke says.      "At the same time the press loudly lambastes herbal      companies for making unproven claims, they're meekly      sleeping through the even greater deficiencies of some of      the synthetic drugs.    </p>    <p>      "How many of us have heard that no herb has been clinically      shown to arrest anthrax? True, none have. But how many of      us has heard that Cipro (the synthetic prescription      antibiotic presumed to work against anthrax) also hasn't      been shown to arrest anthrax? How many have heard that      garlic often <em>works with</em> synthetic antibiotics? If      I were exposed to anthrax, I'd certainly want to take some      garlic (a proven antibacterial) and some echinacea (a      proven immune booster) along with my Cipro if I could even      get the Cipro. The garlic and echinacea, I have in my      garden and in my pantry.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>The pharmaceutical drug industry spends between      $8,000 and $3,000 per year per physician to promote their      products.</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      "How many times do we hear the press tell us that a disease      is especially dangerous for people with compromised immune      systems? Do we ever hear the corollary, that boosting our      immune systems will help us resist these diseases, that      there is an abundance of herbs and foods that can give our      bodies that boost? Ninety percent of plant derived      chemicals are cheaper both environmentally and ecologically      to extract from whole plants than to synthesize. Which      alternative do you think makes more sense?"    </p>    <p>      The media's failure to report positively or even from an      informed perspective on herbs and supplements is a      complicated situation-but worth untangling. At stake      is nothing less than our health. William Allen, an      independent science writer and a senior fellow at the      institutes for Journalism and Natural Resources, says that      those drugcompany advertising dollars are only part of the      picture.    </p>    <p>      "The situation has to do partly with public relations,      partly with the record of scientific achievement of      pharmaceutical companies," Allen says, "and partly with the      perception of drug companies as mainstream and of herbal      companies/advocates as `fringe.' I'm not saying it's fair;      it just is."    </p>    <p>      The pharmaceutical industry has a lengthy record of doing      and supporting good scientific research on many of its      drugs, Allen says. On the other hand, there has been good      science debunking some of the herbal advocates' claims.      This contrast lingers in the minds of many journalists and      shades their perception on both sides of the issue. Add to      this the pharmaceutical industry army of public-relations      flaks, mountains of press releases and incessant presence      in broadcast and print advertising, and the sum is a      well-funded, powerful and extremely aggressive force.    </p>    <p>      "Against this tidal wave," Allen says, "there are      relatively few science writers ... to cover the      pharmaceutical industry for the mass media. This means      <em>...</em> that the drag industry gets relatively, little      scrutiny by journalists qualified to probe the drug      industry's downside-not to mention having the time to      do so. Instead, it's the non-science journalists who get      assigned to crank out a story on the big drug company's      press release about this or that new drug."    </p>    <p>      Drug development and trials are costly affairs:      Pharmaceutical companies are highly motivated to get their      products on the market as soon as they are able. According      to a study from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug      Development, taking a drug from discovery to approval for      marketing in the United States typically takes 10 to 15      years and costs approximately $802 million. Unfortunately,      the drive to recuperate this investment sometimes means      that drugs are on the shelves and in our bodies before      they've been given a good test-drive. Adverse drug      reactions are one of the leading causes of death in this      country, according to a report in the May 2002 <em>Journal      of the American Medical</em> <em>Association (JAMA).</em>      Right up there with heart disease and cancer, we're dying      from drug companies' oopsies.    </p>    <p>      In fact, 10 percent of all new drugs approved from 1975 to      1999 either acquired new warnings or were withdrawn,      according to a JAMA article, which concluded that serious      adverse drug reactions commonly emerge only after FDA      approval. Consider the drug Baycol, widely prescribed as      one of the newest and best defenses against dangerous      cholesterol. The parent company, Bayer, removed Baycol from      the market in 2002 after it was cited as the cause of more      than 30 deaths.    </p>    <p>      The good news is that often it isn't necessary to resort to      drugs. Plenty of foods and herbs can help bring cholesterol      levels down. (See <em>Natural Health,</em> December/January      2002.)    </p>    <p>      Hundreds of reports of adverse side effects on the      antimalarial drug Lariam also are on file, and the Army is      investigating whether Lariam played a role in murders at      Ft. Brag, involving soldiers just returned from Afghanistan      who had taken the drug. Yet, according to Duke, whole sweet      Annie (Artemisia annua), an herb vastly cheaper than the      synthetic chemicals in Lariam, contains several      antimalarial compounds that have been promo to work against      malaria and even cling-resistant bacteria.    </p>    <p>      In January, the FDA announced that all drugs containing      estrogen for menopausal women must include a boxed warning      on labels stating that these drugs may slightly increase      the risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast      cancer. This warning comes decades after the dings were      first placed on the market.    </p>    <p>      The sky-high cost of research also means that many      effective but unpatentable herbal medicines never get fully      tested so they can be marketed as dings. Instead they are      sold as nutritional supplements, and FDA rules prohibit      manufacturers from making health claims about supplements.      If consumers want echinacea to treat a cold, or uva-ursi to      treat a bladder infection, they have to embark on their own      research projects to discover whether the herb is      appropriate for them, if the herbal medicine has      contraindications, and how much and how often they should      he treating themselves. They can buy the herb, but they      won't find this information on the package.    </p>    <p>      Newer drugs are often more expensive and not as effective      as drugs that have been around for a while, but once the      drug companies' patents on new medicine nun cut, any      company can produce a generic version. So the companies      want to establish a beachhead quickly and sell their brands      as aggressively as possible before their patents expire.      Consumers are admonished to buy, buy, <em>buy</em>      medications that may be no more effective but are certainly      more expensive than their older cousins.    </p>    <h3>      EVEN OUR WATER IS ON DRUGS    </h3>    <p>      Many studies have surfaced in the past few years detailing      the appearance of drugs of all kinds, including      antibiotics, antidepressants and hormones, in our water      supplies. Some of these substances have been documented as      causes of genetic mutations in small fish and amphibians.      The primary methods of water treatment in the United States      fail to remove all of these micro-contaminants from our      drinking water, although some studies indicate that      activated charcoal filtration appears most effective.    </p>    <p>      The FDA has said drug residues in water supplies are at      such low levels that they are unlikely to pose risks to      human or aquatic life. But little research exists on how      much of this micro-contamination out-bodies can tolerate or      what is likely to happen when Substance A mixes with      Compound B plus a little fertilizer or pesticide runoff      from local fields. Perhaps nothing, perhaps a lot. The      point is, no one knows.    </p>    <p>      "The unnatural synthetic drugs our genes are just now      experiencing are much more likely to accumulate in the      environment and to harm the human body than natural      compounds our genes have known for 7 <em>million</em>      years," Duke says. "Researchers have estimated that up to      80 percent of drugs taking by people and livestock are      excreted and thin go hack into the environment. If more and      mere synthetic drugs are made and sold, isn't it reasonable      to believe that these substances will increasingly show up      in our drinking water? I would certainly expect that even      low levels of some drugs in our water will have an effect.      Fish and frogs' sex lives today our lives tomorrow."    </p>    <p>      Given medical care's skyrocketing cost and the tact that      cheap, sale and effective herbal alternatives exist lot-      many companies ills, maybe insurance companies will lead      the way to prevention and more natural treatments. A clash      among titans is sure to ensue- <em>Forbes</em>      magazine ranks the pharmaceutical industry as the most      profitable industry in the country, one that's not likely      to go quietly into that good night.    </p>    <p>      But this doesn't mean we arc cut the mercy of the drug      companies and an overly influenced medical profession. We      should review reliable research on whatever medicines we      consume-whether herbal or synthetic-and we      should ask who paid for that research. The Internet makes      it possible as never before to do our own research,      carefully and with a grain of salt. Quackery and deception      abound and we need to be informed enough to spat      it-on either side of the medical divide.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Adverse drug reactions are one of the leading      causes of death in the United States.</strong></em>    </p>
