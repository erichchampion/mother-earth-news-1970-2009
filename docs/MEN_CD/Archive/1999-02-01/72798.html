            		<p>			 <strong>COUNTRY VET</strong></p>				<p>				<strong>Preventive care for pregnant      mares.</strong>		</p>	<h5 id="byline">		      <em>By Bryan M. Waldridge</em>    </h5>        <p>      If Tennyson was right--that "In the spring a young man's      fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love"--well, then,      horses and humans aren't so far apart. Horses are what are      known as long-day breeders, which means that, with longer      days just around the corner, now's the time to start      getting your broodmares ready. Good preventive medicine      will help to ensure the health of the mare and increase the      likelihood of a live foal.		</p>		<h3>				 Good Beginnings			 </h3>		<p>	       Broodmares should be in good overall health and be up to      date on vaccinations, Coggins testing, and deworming. Good      dental care will enable your mare to chew her feed properly      and maintain her weight throughout pregnancy. For optimal      conception rates, broodmares should be neither too thin nor      too fat. What's the right weight? You shouldn't see but      should easily feel your mare's ribs, and there should be      some fat around its tail head. Also, the bones of its      pelvis, neck, and shoulders should blend smoothly with the      rest of the body. The spring transitional period (time to      come into first heat in which ovulation occurs) is longer      in thin mares than in mares in good body condition.</p><p> Many      broodmares have some muscular skeletal or lameness problem      that makes them unsuitable for athletic use. Most of these      conditions will not affect their ability to carry a foal.      However, serious conditions that cause chronic pain will      decrease conception rates. And, as the foal grows and the      mare's weight increases, some lameness problems may become      more severe.</p><p> It's important that prospective broodmares      have excellent conformation of their external reproductive      tract to minimize the possibility of uterine infections.      Ideally, the lips of the vulva should be perpendicular to      the ground and not slope toward the mare's anus.. A      veterinarian can use ultrasound to examine the internal      reproductive tract for uterine cysts, which may hinder the      mare's ability to conceive and maintain pregnancy.      Ultrasound can also be used to image the ovaries and detect      follicles and ovarian tumors.</p><p> Increased amounts of fluid in      the uterus may sometimes be found with uterine infections.      If a uterine infection is suspected, a sterile swab can be      passed into the uterus to check for telltale white blood      cells. A culture can then be performed to identify the      infective bacteria and determine which antibiotics will be      most effective.</p><p> A speculum passed into the uterus can be      used to check for urine pooling in the vagina and to assess      the cervix. Injuries to the cervix can occur during      dystocia (difficult or abnormally painful births) and may      not allow the cervix to close properly during subsequent      pregnancies, increasing the risk of uterine infections.      Biopsies taken from the inside lining of the uterus are      often very useful in determining if there is scarring or      inflammation of the uterus. Uterine biopsies are graded,      enabling your veterinarian to predict your mare's chances      of carrying a foal to term.    </p>    <h3>      Eating for Two    </h3>	<p>			For the first two trimesters, the pregnant mare's    nutritional requirements are the same as before pregnancy.    Mares in early- and mid-gestation can easily maintain their    weight on good quality legume (clover or alfalfa) pasture or    hay and a trace mineral salt block.</p><p> The period of greatest    development is during the last trimester, when 60% to 65% of    fetal growth occurs. The mare's nutritional needs increase    during this time to meet her own requirements, as well as    those of the rapidly growing fetus. In the last three months    of pregnancy, the mare's protein and energy requirements    increase 32% and 20%, respectively. Unless you are feeding    your mare a high-quality forage, she may need X to Y4 pounds    of a high quality grain mix per 100 pounds of body weight    daily to meet her increased requirements. She'll also need    more calcium and phosphorus in order to mineralize the    developing fetal skeleton. Calcium requirements increase by    85% in the last trimester-an amount that can't be met simply    by increasing your mare's feed. At this stage, you'll want to    supplement a grass hay diet with a 50:50 mixture of trace    mineralized salt and dicalcium phosphate, fed free-choice. To    avoid possible bone disease in foals, it's important that    pregnant broodmares be fed nutrients to meet but not exceed    recommended requirements .		</p>    <h3>      Keep off the (Fescue) Grass    </h3>	<p>			Never feed pregnant mares tall fescue grass during the    last trimester of pregnancy, as this may lead to prolonged    gestation, oversized foals, dystocia, decreased milk    production, and thickened placentas, or afterbirth. Tall    fescue grass is the most widely grown forage in the U.S. and    is found mainly in the Southeast and Midwest, where there's    an estimated 35 million acres of the stuff. The toxicity of    fescue is linked to a fungus that grows between the cells of    the plant and produces toxins. While the fungal toxins are    generally bad news for animals, they're a boon for fescue    grass, boosting the plant's resistance to drought and insects    and enhancing its growth. It is estimated that 80% of fescue    pastures are infected by the fungus.</p><p> Horses are more    susceptible to infected fescue than are cattle, and as little    as 5% to 10% infected tall fescue plants in a pasture can    lead to fescue toxicity in mares. Gestation can be prolonged    for several weeks, resulting in a foal that is much larger    than normal, yet at the same time developmentally premature,    with overgrown hooves, fine hair, lax leg tendons, and,    perhaps, missing incisors.</p><p> Many foals born to mares fed    infected fescue will not survive. Only one foal in 11 lived    past the first few days of age in one study. In some cases,    the placenta becomes so thick that the foal, unable to break    out, suffocates. In others, udder development and milk    production are inhibited, leaving the mare with dangerously    little or no colostrum, a necessary source of protective    antibodies for the foal.</p><p> It is possible to test tall fescue    grass or seed to determine if the infective fungus is    present. And noninfected varieties of fescue have been    developed, although they are not as hardy. Also, drugs have    recently become available that help to offset some of the    toxic effects of infected fescue. But the absolute best    prevention remains to avoid feeding tall fescue grass and    that means pasture, hay, and haylage-during the last    trimester.	</p>	    	<p>	  <strong><em>A mare seeds 85% mere calcium in the    last trimester-sad that can't be met by simply increasing    feed.</em></strong>	</p>				<h3>Vaccination and    Deworming		</h3>    <p>      Pregnant mares should be vaccinated for equine herpes virus      1 at five, seven, and nine months of gestation. Equine      herpes virus 1 is a common cause of late term spontaneous      abortion in horses and may also cause respiratory and      central nervous system disease. To reduce the risk of      exposure to equine herpes virus, you'll also want to      isolate your pregnant mares from other horses that have a      history of respiratory tract disease or spontaneous      abortion.</p><p> Vaccination against common equine diseases      such as equine encephalomyelitis, tetanus,      rhinopneumonitis, and influenza should be performed one      month before the expected foaling date to promote high      immunoglobulin concentrations in the colostrum. The foal is      completely dependent on colostrurm for its ability to fight      infections. Vaccinating the mare before foaling will ensure      that the foal will be able to mount an effective immune      response against many of the diseases it is likely to      encounter after birth.</p><p> If the mare is to be moved to a      different farm to foal, this should be done at least one      month beforehand to allow her to produce antibodies against      any diseases present in the new environment.</p><p> Deworm your      broodmare during the last month of gestation to reduce      parasite burdens and decrease the number of eggs to which      the foal may be exposed. Most currently available dewormers      are safe for pregnant mares. Some veterinarians recommend      deworming one or two days after foaling to reduce the      foal's risk of contracting roundworms or small stomach      worms.		</p>		<h3>				 Gestation and Birthing			 </h3>		<p>	 			Normal gestational length-calculated from the last day the mare      stood for breeding-ranges from 320 to 350 days. You'll find      accurate breeding records very useful for predicting      foaling times, allowing you to keep an eye on your mare      during the days that foaling is expected.    </p>    <p>      Prolonged gestation (greater than 350 days) doesn't      necessarily indicate an abnormality, especially if the mare      has no history of exposure to infected tall fescue grass.      Prolonged gestation may occur normally in mares bred early      in the year, in those carrying colts, and in those that are      undernourished during the second half of gestation.    </p>    <p>      Late-term foals may be examined using ultrasound. Your      veterinarian may want to examine the placenta and determine      the fetal heart rate, which can be an indicator of fetal      stress.    </p>    <p>      It is difficult to predict foaling times based on udder      development, appearance of udder secretions, and relaxation      of the tail head and other pelvic ligaments. However,      frequent examination may allow a reasonable guess as to      when foaling is imminent. Usually, the mare's udder will      not appear to enlarge until three to 30 days before      foaling. Maiden mares may not develop an enlarged udder      until one to two days before foaling.</p><p> Normal colostrum      ranges from honey-like to thick and yellowish. As foaling      approaches, some mares may leak colostrum and it may      accumulate on the teat ends (waxing). If the mare leaks      enough, you can milk her periodically before foaling,      freeze the colostrum, and give it to the foal after birth.</p><p>      Water hardness tests and some tests specifically made for      use in mares may be used to predict when mares will foal.      These tests measure colostral concentration of calcium,      which increases as the mare approaches her foaling date.      However, these tests are more useful to predict when a mare      will not foal, rather than when she definitely will.      Several electronic devices are also available that set off      a remote alarm when the foal passes through the birth      canal.</p><p> Be sure foaling stalls are disinfected, clean, warm,      and dry. The stall should be large enough to easily      accommodate the mare, foal, and anyone who assists during      foaling. Mares are very likely to lie down during foaling      and so there must be enough room for the mare to stand up      easily. If foaling appears imminent the mare's vulva may be      washed with an antibacterial soap and her tail wrapped to      minimize contamination.</p><p> Most mares will foal at night or      very early in the morning. Labor progresses through three      stages. During the first stage, the foal positions itself      for delivery, a process that can take anywhere from 30      minutes to four hours. During this stage, the mare may      appear uncomfortable and show clinical signs resembling      colic, such as sweating and pawing at the ground or at its      abdomen. Second-stage labor begins with rupture of the      fetal membranes (water breaks) and ends with delivery of      the foal. This stage is normally very rapid and should not      exceed 40 minutes. If the foal is not delivered within this      period of time, a true emergency exists and you should call      your veterinarian. Third-stage labor involves passage of      the placenta and should be complete within four hours.      After the placenta is passed, carefully examine it for      missing pieces. It's important that no part of the      afterbirth remain in the uterus. Retained placenta in mares      can cause serious complications including founder      (laminitis) and severe uterine infections-and requires      veterinary attention.</p><p> Breeding mares and following them      through gestation to foaling can be a very rewarding      experience. Good preventive health care along the way will      increase the chances of a healthy mare and foal. Your      veterinarian is the best source of advice for health cafe      and any problems that may be a concern in your area.    </p>
