                    <h2>      AN ELECTRIC MINI-CAR FOR URBAN DRIVING    </h2>        <p>      California aerospace engineer Paul R. Shipps has had long      and varied experience in the design, development, and      testing of rockets, aircraft, and other advanced vehicles.    </p>    <p>      Six years ago, when Paul started his own small      advanced-vehicle design, consultation, and testing      business-however-he had something more down-to-earth in      mind: the creation of energy-efficient,      environmentally kind, day-to-day personal transportation.    </p>    <p>      In recent months, Paul says, even this work has been slowed      in order to allow for the attack on a still more urgent      problem: the rapidly multiplying government regulations      which have already made the use of innovative and efficient      mini-vehicles like the ones he has in mind nearly      impossible in this country.    </p>    <p>      Paul's written a $3.00 booklet, Electric Mini-Cars for      Urban Driving, which began as an educational handbook on      electric cars, efficient energy use, and small car safety.      As it turned out, though, the fact filled publication is      also an expose of our nation's poorly-thought-out vehicle      safety regulations.    </p>    <p>      At present, only one Shipps-designed mini-car-the      three-wheel, 2.5-horsepower, maximum-30-mph "Sportster"      shown here-qualifies for marketing. Paul expects to      have plans for the vehicle available (for $15) by the time      you read this. And he'll soon be offering three-part kits      which can be assembled into your own Sportster at a total      cost of about $1,200 (excluding batteries). With the kits      will come full-size template blueprints to simplify      construction for the amateur.    </p>    <p>      Paul estimates that it will take one individual three      months of spare time to put together one of his mini-cars.

Actually, though, the 825-pound mini-car uses less energy per mile than does the 150-mpg, 100-pound moped!
