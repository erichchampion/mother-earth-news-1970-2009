             			 			<h5 id="byline">by TILDE MERKERT</h5>      <p>If you start your herbs and flowers and many of your      vegetables indoors from seed as I do, you may want to try      the inexpensive germination booster that I find handy. For      one thing, it's easy to put together, and - for another -      it really does the job I want it to do.    </p>      <p> Not only does my little plant starter      speed germination ... it also seems to help prevent      "damping off" (the killer fungus to which seedlings are      subject. If their planting medium isn't absolutely      sterile). And it accomplishes all this by the mere      introduction of some auxiliary heat to the tiny      plants-to-be.</p><p> To make a "seed incubator" like mine, start      by finding an insulated pad ... the kind that's metal on      one side and asbestos on the other. Such pads are used to      protect counters and tabletops from hot pots and are      available at hardware or kitchen supply stores. The pad's      dimensions will determine the capacity of your starting box      (I've found 13" by 19" to be a good size). </p><p>Next get some      four-ply plywood (about 5/8" thick) and cut two box sides,      each measuring 5" by 18-1/2". Then saw out two 5" by      12-1/4" end pieces, and nail the four components together      to form a topless, bottomless box</p><p>. Now-out of 1/4"-thick      lath-cut two "tabs", each 81 by 1/2". Nail these to the      center of the box's long sides (as pictured), so that half      (or 1/4") of their width extends above the top edge of your      indoor gardening aid. And now cut another pair of tabs      (make each of these only four inches long) and nail them      the same way to the box's ends. (These tabs will hold the      insulated pad - which is going to rest on top of the box -      in it's proper position.) </p><p>Next, mount two wired porcelain      light fixtures to the inside ends of your warming device,      with their shared cord clamped to the corners (as shown)      and extending out through a small hole beside one of the      fixtures. (The total length of the cord depends on the      distance to the electrical outlet you'll be using.) Attach      a plug to the end of the cord, and screw two 15- or 25-watt      light bulbs (the lesser wattage will probably provide      sufficient heat) into the fixtures.</p><p> Place the finished      frame on a slab of asbestos or a heavy piece of board atop      your propagating table (or in another handy spot), and set      the insulated pad squarely over the top of the box, metal      side up. </p><p>Finally, arrange your planting trays or other      seed-starting containers on top of the pad, where they can      be watered easily and where they'll be gently and evenly      warmed. Do leave the lights on continually for as long as      it takes the seedlings to sprout their second?or true-pair      of leaves. From then on, adequate sunlight will provide all      the warmth the young plants will need until It's time to      set them out in your garden.    </p>

In use, the box is flipped over so that the ""tab"" you see along the bottom edge of the rectangle's nearest side (and matching tabs nailed to the other three sides of the box as well) are on top of the topless and bottomless base.
