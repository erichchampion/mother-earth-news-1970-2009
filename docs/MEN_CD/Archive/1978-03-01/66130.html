                <h5 id="byline">     by CAROL ANN FULLER    </h5>        <p>      Green bean lovers, arise and take note: To enjoy this      tender, tasty, succulent vegetable at its flavorful best...      you've just gotta grow and process your own!    </p>        <p>      The green bean section of our northern Utah garden is      always one of the most prolific parts of the produce patch.      And the bushels of beans we pick each season are definitely      at the top of my family's list of year-round favorite      vegetables.    </p>    <p>      That's probably because we've developed our very own      "down-home" methods of growing and processing the beans ...      methods which yield a vegetable only remotely resembling      the limp, tasteless, flat, conned green beans that most      folks now pick from the supermarket shelves.    </p>    <h3>      IT ALL STARTS WITH THE RIGHT VARIETY ... AND COW MANURE    </h3>    <p>      We've found that pole beans (stringless pole beans) are a      far better choice than bush beans for the home garden. The      pole beans-which grow up, rather than out-take up less      space. And if you keep them picked back, they'll bear for a      much longer period.    </p>    <p>      Here in northern Utah, we have good luck with Blue Lake      Poles (available from Burpee, Henry Field, J.W. Jung, L.L.      Olds, and George W. Park seed companies). Check with other      vegetable raisers or a reputable garden center in your area      for the names of stringless pole beans that grow best where      you live.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps a commercial fertilizer would achieve the same      result. But we don't know because we have cows and we've      never had to buy our vegetables' plant food from a store.      We just spread a moderate amount of barnyard droppings      across the garden, and plow and harrow it in with the      tractor during the fall or very early spring. (if you don't      have real farm equipment to use, you can do the same job      with a heavy-duty rototiller ... or a shovel.) It's then      fairly easy to rake and rerake the fertilized and worked      soil Into an "onion bed" when planting time rolls around.    </p>    <p>      And we do plant early ... while the ground is still moist      and soft. The beans don't require anything fancy either: We      just scratch out a shallow trench?perhaps a couple of      inches deep-with the point of the hoe. Then we drop in a      thick row of beans, cover the seeds, and tamp the soil      lightly.    </p>    <p>      Most seed packet directions stress that green bean      seedlings should be thinned as they sprout and break the      ground. "Only adequately spaced plants," we're told, "will      grow vigorousty and bear heavily." Well, in poor soil,      maybe so. We've found, however, that our garden's earth      plus cow manure plus plenty of summer water produce growing      conditions so good that we never have to thin our beans at      all.    </p>    <h3>      OUR BEANS CLIMB THE FENCE    </h3>    <p>      It's so time consuming to set up an individual pole or      string for each bean plant to climb ... that we simply      don't do it. Instead we wait until the seedlings are two to      three inches tall. Then we drive a steel fencepost (easy to      put in and easy to take out again in the fall) into the      ground at each end of each row of beans. We also pound a      couple more of the posts into the earth at equally spaced      points along every row.    </p>    <p>      It's then a simple matter to string some lightweight woven      wire fencing down each row and secure it to the posts with      twists of used baling wire. Such a quickie fence-while far      too flimsy to turn a rambunctious animal?is just what the      climbing bean plants need. Within days the seedlings'      tendrils begin to reach out, wrap themselves around the      support, and pull the profusely sprouting beanstalks up the      wire gridwork.    </p>    <h3>      FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE DO THE REST!    </h3>    <p>      Beans need a lot of fresh air and sunshine. Not only to      produce a bumper crop, but because anthracnose and blight      (two of the plants' worst enemies) cause the most damage      under moist, damp conditions.    </p>    <p>      For that reason, we like to plant two rows of beans (spaced      far enough apart for easy picking, weeding, and tending)      ... then a couple of rows of low-growing "spacer" crops ...      then two more of beans, etc. Carrots and beets make good      spacer vegetables. Or, if you wont something that'll help      repel bean beetles, try onions, garlic, and summer savory.    </p>    <p>      Water your beans regularly as they grow (but don't keep the      ground around them soaked) ... and if you fertilized,      planted, and supported the plants property in the first      place, fresh air and sunshine will do the rest.    </p>    <h3>      BUMPER HARVESTS ARE THE NORM    </h3>    <p>      I've said that our green beans are prolific, and I meant      it. Although we sometimes plant more, three 12-foot rows      are all we ever need to supply ourselves and our neighbors      with fresh beans throughout the summer ... and feed our      family all of the delicious vegetables that we want all      winter long.    </p>    <p>      We usually start picking low on the vines (while the plants      are still blooming farther up) and gradually work our way      to their tops. And do pick those vines hard! The more beans      you harvest, the more the plants will produce.    </p>    <h3>      USE YOUR BOUNTY LOTS OF WAYS    </h3>    <p>      One of the easiest and most popular ways to serve green      beans is boiled ... with pepper, salt, and butter. And      there's absolutely no need to laboriously pop off their      ends and snap stringless bean pods into short lengths      before cooking either. Just break off the stems, snap the      extra-long pods once in their centers if you absolutely      must, and drop 'em in the kettle. The bloom-ends of the      pods are powerhouses of vitamins and other nutrients and      it's to your health advantage to leave 'em on. If your      eager eaters are too proud to munch whole pods at once,      they can cut 'em into pieces on their plates.    </p>    <p>      Overcooked beans-by the way-lose flavor, color, texture,      eye appeal, and nutritional value. Depending on your      altitude, you should find that green beans fresh from the      garden are ready to eat when boiled in an open pan for 10      minutes or less. Or put a mess of the tasty vegetables in a      pressure cooker with a quarter cup of water and a pinch of      salt, and they'll be table-ready after cooking just two      minutes.    </p>    <p>      Other serving suggestions: Green beans are hard to beat      prepared with onions, peppers, chunks of ham, or bits of      bacon. Or pickle the long ones in a vinegar-sugar-water      solution for a cold salad. The beans also pickle well with      cucumbers and/or onions. Green beans are delicious, too, in      casseroles ... and the boiled beans can always be chopped      and added to an otherwise raw leafy salad. Use your      imagination!    </p>    <p>      If some of the beans "get away from you" before you can      pick them, don't throw the oversized pods away. Pick 'em,      snap 'em into bite-sized pieces, steam 'em, drain 'em,      saut√© the cooked beans in buffer with fresh      mushrooms, and serve. Mmmm mmmm! Are they good!    </p>    <p>      And don't forget that the juice from your cooked beans is      also flavorful and nutritious. Save it and add it to soups,      gravies, stews, and casseroles. I even freeze some for      later use.    </p>    <h3>      SAVE SOME FOR WINTER    </h3>    <p>      Extra beans-either whole or snapped?can be dried (see      MOTHER NOS. 6, 10, 34, and 46) very quickly and easily for      winter eatin'. They reconstitute nicely in soups. Or soak      'em in water and add 'em to creamed dishes.    </p>    <p>      It's also easy to freeze a lot of beans for later meals      with little effort if you organize your work.    </p>    <p>      Pick the pods when they're young and tender and wash them      well. (Be sure to remove the fine, hair-like "fuzz"?which      can harbor foreign matter and cause spoilage-from the      pods.) I dump my fresh pickings into a sink of water, swish      'em around, pick out individual pods, snap off their stems,      break the biggest ones in half, and drop the pieces into      another sink of water. The beans are then swished around      again and transferred to a wire basket (with handle).    </p>    <p>      When the basket is halt to two-thirds full, I plunge it      into a pot of boiling water. As soon as the water (set over      my stove's high heat) has come back up to a boil, I start      timing .. . and blanch the beans for three minutes.    </p>    <p>      The bright-green pods are next dumped into a sink of ice      water and swished around once more. As they cool, I start      blanching another basket of the vegetables ... then come      back, scoop the cooled beans out of sink one and into a      second sink of icy water. The pods are then swished around      again for a minute or two (don't leave them in the water      any longer than necessary) until they're chilled all the      way through.    </p>    <p>      At that point the cold pods are scooped out of the water,      drained, and spread on a porous terry towel to dry further      ... before being sealed in plastic bags, labeled, dated,      and put in the freezer.    </p>    <p>      This "assembly line" processing goes quite rapidly,      especially when I've frozen several blocks of ice ahead (in      loaf pans, recycled cartons, etc.) for the chilling part.      Later, in the winter, it's just as easy and convenient to      dump a package of the frozen vegetables (no need to thaw)      into a pan and cook 'em up exactly as if it were still      summer.    </p>    <p>      Fresh and almost-fresh delicious green beans all year      round! You and your family can enjoy these delights too.      Just plant a few magic beanstalks this spring!    </p>
