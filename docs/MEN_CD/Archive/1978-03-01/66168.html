                        <h3>      MARY JO WAMSER    </h3>    <p>      I can't help it. I've been growing Swiss chard (Beta      vulgaris cicla) for three years ... and I've become so      hooked on this wonderful plant that I just can't help      raving about it. Wouldn't you talk up a food crop that's      [11 easy to grow, [2] colorful enough to serve as an      ornamental, [3] mild-tasting, [41 loaded with nutrients,      and [5] exceedingly resistant to pests?    </p>    <p>      Chard's beauty sets it apart from most garden greens. Its      tall, curlyedged, dark-green leaves-with their slender,      ivory-white centers-make the plant truly an "edible      decoration". (For that reason, Beta vulgaris cicla is just      as eye-pleasing when grown in a pot as it is sown along the      borders of a path or in traditional rows.) And with no more      care than the regular waterings and feedings that you      extend to the other inhabitants of your garden, chard      quickly grows lush and strong ... and stays that way. Fact      is, if you're careful to harvest only the leaves, the      plant's rootstocks will continue to flourish and send up      plume-like foliage year after year . . . in which case      you'll never have to buy seed again.    </p>    <p>      Chard isn't just "another pretty face in the pea patch",      however ... it's also good for you. Only 100 grams (about      3-1/2 ounces) of B. vulgaris cicla-briefly steamed or      cooked in a little water till limp-contain 1.8 grams      of protein, 1.8 milligrams of iron, and 5,400 International      Units (more than the minimum adult daily requirement) of      vitamin A. And if you eat the greens raw, the figures are      even more impressive: The same 100 grams of uncooked chard      contain 2.4 grams of protein, 3.2 milligrams of iron, 6,500      I.U. of vitamin A, and 32 milligrams of vitamin C to boot.    </p>    <p>      But alas, the flavor of chard is not what you'd call      "exciting". Chardin fact-is rather bland and lacks the zip      of, say, spinach or mustard greens. Perhaps this is just as      well. Many people prefer delicately flavored vegetables ...      and (as luck would have it) a large number of garden pests      don't. (Snails and slugs, for instance, have been known to      turn down chard in favor of nearby plantings of spinach or      romaine.) Those of us who wish to enhance chard's rather      benign taste, however, can do so easily by preparing the      greens with such flavory companions as garlic, onions,      and/or cheese. (Suggestions follow.)    </p>    <p>      By now, you have-I trust-had your "chard      consciousness" raised, your sense of frugality stimulated,      and (I hope) your curiosity aroused. If so, do go out and      invest 39c in a packet of Swiss chard seed (a packet      that-once planted-may well keep you supplied with the      food forever). You have nothing to lose ... and a whole new      dimension of aesthetic and gustatory delight to savor.    </p>    <h3>      SUN-SEEDY CHARD (Serves 4)    </h3>    <p>      With this dish, the most critical element is timing. The      various ingredients require very little cooking time, and      once cooked-should not be allowed to sit while you set the      table. If you want everything to taste fresh and crisp,      prepare your table and pour the drinks first ... then start      cooking.    </p>    <p>      1 pound of fresh chard<br />      1/4 cup of margarine or butter<br />      2 cloves of garlic, minced<br />      1 medium onion, chopped<br />      1/2 cup of shelled sunflower seeds<br />      1 pound of fresh mushrooms, washed and sliced salt and      pepper to taste<br />      1-1/2 cups of grated cheese (cheddar, Jack, Swiss,      Parmesan, or any combination thereof)<br />    </p>    <p>      Wash the chard and cut the green parts of the leaves from      the central white shafts, then pack the greens into a      steamer or a good-sized pan that contains a little water.      Chop the white part of the chard.    </p>    <p>      Next, melt the margarine or butter in a frying pan and      saute the garlic, onion, seeds, and white parts of the      chard for about 10 minutes (that is, until the vegetables      are limp and the seeds crisp). Add the mushrooms to the      frying pan and turn the heat on under the pan of chard.      Bring the chard to a boil, then reduce the heat to the      lowest setting and allow the greens to simmer. At the same      time, cook and stir the mushroom-garlic-onion-seed mixture      until the mushrooms have released most of their liquid ...      about 10 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. By this time,      the chard in the pan should be just limp.    </p>    <p>      Now remove the chard from the pan with tongs (or with a      large slotted spoon) and distribute the greens evenly among      four plates. Top with grated cheese, spoon the hot mushroom      mixture over all, and serve immediately. (Hint: A wedge of      lemon is a nice go-with, as are slices of tomato and/or      other fruit.)    </p>    <h3>      GREEN RICE    </h3>    <p>      (Makes 8 side-dish servings or 4 main-dish servings)<br />      1 pound of fresh chard water<br />      3 cups of cooked (approx. I cup raw) brown rice<br />      1/2 cup of chopped or slivered almonds<br />      2 eggs, well beaten<br />      1 cup of milk<br />      2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce<br />      1-1/4 teaspoons of salt<br />      1/2 cup of chopped onion<br />      1/4 cup of butter or margarine<br />      1/2 cup of grated sharp cheese    </p>    <p>      Wash the chard and cut the green parts away from the white      stalks. (You may dispose of the white part at this point,      or chop the stalks up, saute them briefly, and add them to      the casserole mixture below.) Steam or cook the greens in a      small amount of water ... then-in a large strainer-drain      the leaves and press as much water from them as you can      with your hands or the back of a spoon. Chop the greens      into very small pieces.    </p>    <p>      Now-using a fork-toss the almonds and the cooked brown rice      and chard together in a large bowl. Add the eggs, milk,      Worcestershire sauce, salt, and onion. Toss everything      gently, being careful not to mash the grains of rice.    </p>    <p>      Finally, pour the mixture into a greased two-quart      casserole dish, dot the contents with butter or margarine,      and sprinkle grated cheese over the top. Bake at 350'F for      30 to 40 minutes.    </p>    <h3>      CHARD SOUFFLE (Serves 4)    </h3>    <p>      3 tablespoons of butter or margarine<br />      3 tablespoons of whole wheat flour<br />      1 cup of scalded milk<br />      1/2 cup of grated sharp cheese<br />      2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion<br />      1/2 cup of cooked, drained, and finely chopped chard<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      4 egg yolks, beaten<br />      4 egg whites    </p>    <p>      Melt the butter or margarine in a saucepan and blend in the      flour, stirring constantly over a medium flame. Gradually      stir in the milk and blend until smooth. Then lower the      heat and add the cheese, onion, chard, and salt, and      continue to stir until the cheese has melted. Remove the      mixture from the heat and pour it over the beaten egg yolks      in a bowl. Blend well and allow the mixture to stand.    </p>    <p>      In another bowl, beat the egg whites until they're stiff      but not dry. Gently fold the egg whites into the      cheese-chard-onion mixture, then pour the combination into      a greased souffle dish or a straight-sided casserole. Bake-      uncovered- in a 375' oven until the souffle has puffed up      and browned (about 35 minutes). Serve at once (before it      falls).    </p>        <h3>      EXTRAORDINARY LASAGNA (Serves 6 or 8)    </h3>    <p>      1 medium onion, chopped<br />      1 clove of garlic, minced<br />      2 tablespoons of olive or salad oil<br />      1 pound of hamburger<br />      1/2 pound of fresh mushrooms, sliced<br />      1 can (8 ounces) of tomato sauce<br />      1 can (6 ounces) of tomato paste<br />      2 teaspoons of salt<br />      1 teaspoon of oregano<br />      3/4 cup of water or dry red wine<br />      1 cup of cooked, drained, and finely chopped chard (about 1      pound raw)<br />      I1 cup of cottage cheese<br />      1/3 cup of grated Parmesan cheese<br />      2 eggs<br />      1 package (12 ounces) of lasagna noodles, cooked according      to package directions<br />      1/2 pound of Monterey Jack cheese, grated<br />    </p>    <p>      Brown the onion and garlic lightly in one tablespoon of the      oil in a large frying pan. Add the hamburger and cook until      the meat is no longer red. Throw in the sliced mushrooms      and cook until they've lost most of their liquid . . . then      stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, one teaspoon of      salt, the oregano, and the water or wine. Simmer 15      minutes.    </p>    <p>      In a clean bowl, combine the chard with the cottage cheese,      the Parmesan cheese, one of the eggs, and the remaining      teaspoon of salt and tablespoon of oil. In another bowl,      beat the second egg slightly and toss with the cooked and      drained lasagna noodles.    </p>    <p>      Now pour half the meat sauce into the bottom of a long      (about 9" X 13") baking dish and cover with half of the      noodles. Spread all of the cheese/chard mixture over this      and top with [1] the remaining lasagna noodles, followed by      [21 the remaining meat sauce. Next, cover the baking dish      with foil and pop it into a 350' oven. About 45 minutes      later, remove the foil and sprinkle grated Jack cheese over      the hot lasagna . . . then return the dish to the oven      (uncovered) and bake 15 to 20 minutes longer. Allow the      lasagna to cool five to 10 minutes before dishing it up.    </p>    <p>      Add a green salad, bread, and wine to this extraordinary      main dish, and you've got a thoroughly delightful meal for      up to eight persons. And if this doesn't make you a chard      fanatic ... I don't know what will!    </p>
