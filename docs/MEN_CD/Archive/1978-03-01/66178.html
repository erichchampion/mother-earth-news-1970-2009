              		    		<hr />    <p>      <em>I'm not exactly wild about plastic (few of us are),      but-like everyone else- I end up using it anyway. And-like      more and more folks these days?I end up reusing what little      plastic I come in contact with again and again before      throwing it out.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Over the years, I've seen lots of ways to "recycle"      plastic ... but it wasn't until I visited my      father-in-law's garden last summer that I learned of a way      to recycle plastic and keep birds, rabbits, and groundhogs      out of the garden at the same time.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It's like this: One windy day, Ed (my father-in-law)      took a large plastic trash bag full of grass clippings over      to his garden to work into the soil, After dumping the      clippings, however, he found himself clutching a big, empty      sack that was flapping violently in the wind. Not wanting      to be left holding the bag (so to speak), Ed opened the      sack, dropped it over a nearby post, and started doing      something else. Then-before going home-he tied the bag to      the post (so it would stay put).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>During the next few days-as he worked in the      garden-Ed watched birds fly into and out of his      strawberry patch. Not just into . . . but into and out of      the patch. The birds didn't stay long when they landed, and      they didn't seem to land as often as before.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Ed also noticed that-oddly enough?when the plastic      crackled in the wind, rabbits left the area almost as fast      as Bugs</em> Bunny zips <em>through a Warner Brothers'      cartoon. Even groundhogs kept their dis'eance. (One lived      close by all summer, but never bothered the garden.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So ... if you're fed up with plastic and</em> <em>with      garden pests, good news! You can use one to bother the      other. All you need are some stakes or posts (which you      probably already have in place), a little twine, and a used      trash bag or two. Put 'em all together, and you've got a      plastic scarecrow: a "scare bag".</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If scare bags have one drawback, it's that they work      too well. People in Ed's garden, for instance, are always      looking to see who or what is behind them. (Ed admits that      he's turned and said, "Howdy", to a plastic bag more times      than he likes to remember!) I'd say that's a pretty small      price to pay, however, for a device that [1] lets you make      good use of "useless" plastic and [2] helps put food on the      table, too ... wouldn't you?</em>    </p>
