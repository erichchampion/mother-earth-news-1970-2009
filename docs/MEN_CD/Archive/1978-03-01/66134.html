Many tax consultants (both part-time and full-time) do their work on the kitchen table (below right) or even on a card table set up in their very own living room (below, left). It doesn't really matter to most of their clients, who are more interested in having their tax returns prepared fast and accurately than they are in the surroundings in which that preparation was done. This is just one of the many reasons that a professional tax service can be set up on even the tiniest of shoestrings ... yet net its operator a minimum of $1,500 (for no more than 14 weeks' work) the very first year. And after that, the sky is the limit!
