    <p>
                        <p>      Contrary to what you may have thought, you don't need a      great deal of greenery-either in the form of      pastureland or money-to get started raising cattle.      Not if you do it Luilla Thompson's way!    </p>    <p>      So you want to raise a small herd (maybe just two or three      head) of cattle ... and enjoy honest-to-goodness      "homegrown" milk, cream, butter, yogurt, cottage cheese,      ice cream, and/or beef for a change? But you don't have the      time, money, acreage, or know-how to start right out with      several full-grown animals? Then here's a suggestion: Why      not start small ... by raising bottle calves?    </p>    <p>      Ken and I acquired our very first herd this way more than      ten years ago. Since then, we've ''mothered" a good many      baby bovines (and learned a great deal through trial and      error). And we're still convinced that the ''bottle method"      is by far the easiest, most economical, most educational      way to get started in small-scale dairy farming or beef      raising.    </p>    <h3>      WHERE TO BUY CALVES    </h3>    <p>      Whenever possible, Ken and I buy our calves directly from      the original owner, and we recommend that you do the same.      Check with local dairies, which frequently sell some of      their calves at birth. (An advantage of buying from a dairy      is that sometimes the calf has been allowed to nurse for a      few days, in which case the young'un has already gotten a      good dose of the colostrum-or first milk-it      needs for a good start in life.) While you're at the dairy,      ask about buying some fresh colostrum too (even if they      have no calves to sell you). A couple plastic jugfuls of      colostrum kept at home in the freezer can come in handy      later on.    </p>    <p>      You can sometimes also purchase calves at feedlots,      since-frequently- cows that are brought to the lots      for fattening are pregnant, and the managers of the      operations don't want to bother with infants. Quite often,      too, a calf born in one of these huge "meat factories" will      get very little care (perhaps not even a first feeding).      Hence, you may want to ask someone who works at a feedlot      to notify you immediately when a calf is born.    </p>    <p>      We also buy calves now and then from the local livestock      auction ... buy only if we feel we have the time, money,      and extra pens to gamble with. (The sad truth is, you never      really know what you're getting when you buy an animal at      auction.) If you decide to go to one of the sales, try to      arrive several hours before the bidding starts and don't      buy any critter that you can't check close-up first.    </p>    <p>      What does a calf cost? Well, the current price for day-old      calves in this area (Broadwater, Nebraska) is about $50.      Calves from milker stock can still be bought at auction for      about $25, however. (Last spring, I purchased eight little      ones at auction for an average of $10 each. Four turned out      to be "hot calves" [see below] and died the first week ...      while the other four grew well and netted us a nice return      in the fall.)    </p>    <h3>      WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A CALF    </h3>    <p>      Before Ken and I purchase any calf, we check it over very      carefully. First, we stand the animal up and run our hands      over its body to check for swellings, enlarged bones, and      deformities. (We also put an ear to the critter's rib cage      to try to detect lung problems.)    </p>    <p>      Next, we check the baby's navel for signs of infection.      Navel ill-a troublesome malady that afflicts newborns      whose umbilical cords haven't been clipped (or sterilized)      properly-is difficult to treat once it takes hold, since      the infection spreads rapidly throughout the body. Better      to discover it now than later.    </p>    <p>      Finally, we give the prospective purchase a good "once      over" to see that the infant's eyes are bright and clear      (no clouds or white spots), its ears are up and alert (not      drooped), and its nostrils are free of any discharge. We      also put the animal to the "finger test": A healthy calf      will usually suck your finger. (If the youngun squirms or      pulls away when you perform this-or any other test,      consider it a good sign. A sick or poor-quality calf is      usually overly docile.)    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO AVOID BUYING A "HOT CALF"    </h3>    <p>      Calves born in feedlots should be examined very carefully      before any money changes hands. Many (if not most) of the      lots put their cattle on a diet high in concentrates and      additives ... feed that makes the animals gain a great deal      of weight very quickly, but that can leave the stomachs and      intestines of unborn calves badly "burned". Such burned      infants are known in the trade as hot calves.    </p>    <p>      Hot calves rarely live more than a few weeks, since they      cannot absorb food. Therefore, it's imperative that you      determine whether the feedlot calf you're thinking of      buying is ''hot" before you commit yourself to the      purchase.    </p>    <p>      Open the calf's mouth and smell its throat. If the mother      was on hot feed, the odor will be sour-sweet and very      strong (somewhat like rotten ensilage). Also check the      animal's gums: They may be blue-tinged, or even bloody. In      general, you'll find that a hot calf is listless, has      droopy ears and dull eyes (eyes that may also show white      "burn" spots), and prefers to lie tightly curled in a fetal      position.    </p>    <p>      If the calf you're looking at displays any of the above      symptoms ... save your money and move on to the next one.    </p>    <h3>      KEEP YOUR PURCHASE DRY AND WARM    </h3>    <p>      You can't buy an already-stressed calf, haul it 30 miles in      the back of a pickup in cold weather, and expect the animal      to survive (much less thrive). Some provision must be made      for keeping the baby bovine dry and warm from the time you      buy it until you can get it home to a draft-free pen.    </p>    <p>      Whenever Ken and I go out to buy a calf, we always (even if      it's only a little chilly) drive through an alley behind a      nearby appliance store and [1] pick up a large cardboard      crate (the kind that stoves and freezers come in), [2] put      some straw in the box, and [3] set the container in the      truck. (We also carry an old quilt with us to wrap the      animal in, since calves are usually wet and/or muddy at the      time of sale.) Then we're ready to tuck our new baby into a      nice, comfortable, sheltered environment for the trip home.    </p>    <p>      When we arrive back -at the farm, we immediately isolate      the new calf from the rest of our herd. (It's easier than      you think to wipe out a large portion of an existing      herd?one that you've spent a lot of time building up-by      bringing in a strange calf that harbors disease germs.)      Then-as an added precaution-we change our clothes and shoes      before doing any chores. (A good many diseases can be      carried home from an auction-or a feedlot-on      the soles of boots.)    </p>    <p>      About housing: A simple threesided lean-to (measuring, say,      4' X 5') built against the side of a shed or garage will      suffice to keep your baby out of the cold. Or you can build      a freestanding structure. Just [1] plant four posts in the      ground, [2] nail two-by-fours between the tops (and the      bottoms) of the uprights, (3] fasten old boards (or what      have you) to the structure's sides, and [4] cover the top      with chicken wire and a layer of straw or hay      (plus-maybe-an old flap of canvas that can be      let down over the front during really nasty weather).    </p>    <p>      For his first few days at home, we like to make sure our      new baby is dry, warm, and comfortable. That means plenty      of straw or hay for bedding, and-if the weather is cold -a      heat lamp for extra coziness (since the infant doesn't have      its mother around to help keep it warm). And do keep the      baby both warm and dry, with the emphasis on that last      word. (Calves can actually withstand below-zero      temperatures easily if they're dry. Wet and cold-on the      other hand-are two of the surest invitations to scours I      can think of.)    </p>    <h3>      FEEDING TIME    </h3>    <p>      Once your baby is established in his new quarters, it's      time to feed him. For this, you'll need a couple of calf      bottles (which you can obtain at any feed store or      veterinary supply house). These bottles hold two quarts      each and are preferable-in my opinion- to "nipple      buckets".    </p>    <p>      If the calf is only a few hours old and hasn't had its      first meal with mama, you'll want to feed the critter warm      (i.e., body-temperature) colostrum ... a quart of it, if      he'll drink that much. Without at least one feeding of this      precious fluid (which is rich in proteins, minerals,      vitamins, and disease-fighting antibodies), the calf's      chances of survival are greatly reduced.    </p>    <p>      In the event fresh (or frozen) colostrurn isn't available,      you can concoct a satisfactory "colostrum replacer" as      follows: First, mix together two eggs, a tablespoon of      honey, onehalf teaspoon of powdered A, D, and E vitamins (I      use Pfizer's water-soluble AD and E), and one cup of bovine      milk replacer (available from the feed store). Stir this      mixture into one quart of warm water and administer it in      onequart quantities for the calf's first two feedings.    </p>    <p>      As soon as our new animal has had his first feeding, we      give him a shot of A, D, and E vitamins to help him along.      (A small bottle of liquid A, D, and E will cost you $5.00,      but it'll treat many calves and will be well worth the      money.) We inject 1/2-cc of the vitamins (using a small      needle and syringe) intramuscularly in the fleshy part of      the critter's rump. Afterwards, we follow up with a 1/2-cc      shot of Combioticagain given "I.M."-either in the opposite      hip or the shoulder. (Combiotic contains penicillin and      dihydrostreptomycin ... antibiotics that will help stave      off any infections that may have gotten started in the sale      yard, on the ride home, etc.) [EDITOR'S NOTE: If you've      never given an injection before, you'll do well to reader      reread-Linda Martin's article, "How to Give That      First Injection" , in MOTHER NO. 43, page 90a.]    </p>    <p>      After the baby's first two feedings, switch from colostrum      to highquality milk replacer. The key words here are      high-quality. Don't buy the cheapest milk replacer you can      find, unless its contents are the same as the more      expensive mixes. (Check the protein and fat content on the      bag. Some replacers have a protein count of only 12-1/2%,      which is much too weak. You want a protein level of at      least 25%.)    </p>    <p>      Instructions for mixing bovine milk replacer come on the      sack. You may want-as I do-to make the fluid a little      richer for the first few weeks by putting a well-beaten egg      into every two quarts of replacer. (This adds food value      and makes the calf's eye and coat shine.) A little honey in      the mix will help combat constipation.    </p>    <p>      How often-and how muchshould you feed your bottle baby?      Some folks say to feed one quart twice a day at first. But      I prefer to give our calves each one quart three times a      day for their first two weeks ... then two quarts twice      daily until the fourth month, by which time the young      bovine should be eating mainly solid food. (See the      accompanying "Feeds and Feeding" chart.)    </p>    <h3>      FEEDS AND FEEDING    </h3>    <p>          WHAT TO FEED                  Birth to two weeks.                 Two one-quart feedings of colostrum the first day, then          one quart of milk replacer three times a day. (Keep          fresh water and alfalfa before the calves.)                Two to eightweeks.                  Two quarts of milk replacer twice daily. Be gin feeding          calf pellets (the best you can buy). Put salt in pen          and continue to make water and alfalfa available.                  Eight to 12 weeks.                  Start mixing pellets with a ground feed made by          combining ground corn, oats, and bran with a little          powdered molasses. (Gradually increase the ratio of          ground feed to pellets.) Feed two pounds of grain per          day per calf, plus two quarts of milk replacer twice          daily. Continue to offer salt, water, and alfalfa.          (Good green pasture may be substituted for the          alfalfa.)                  12 to 16 weeks.                  Two quarts of milk replacer once a day. Offer access to          good leafy forage or good grass. If you're raising the          calf for beef, you may increase the allotment of grain          (mentioned above) ... other wise-if grass is very          good-the calf can graze through the summer. (In summer,          our calves get just pasture grass, iodized salt, free          choice minerals, and water.)                 Note:                  Excellent material on feeds and feeding is usually          available free of charge through the county extension          office. Check the county listings in the white pages of        </p>    <h3>      WHAT TO DO IF YOUR<br />      CALF REFUSES ITS BOTTLE    </h3>    <p>      Sometimes (especially if the youngster has already grown      accustomed to nursing his mother) a perfectly healthy calf      will refuse the bottle. I find that the easiest way to get      a reluctant beastie to eat in such a case is to [1] fill      the bottle with milk that's nice and warm, [2] stand      astraddle the calf, holding him firmly between your knees,      [3] lean forward until your chest is over its head, and [4]      place the bottle in the calf's mouth. Of course, if the      calf is particularly husky you'll have to watch that he      doesn't throw his head up quickly and bump you in the      chest. This method has, however, always worked well for me      (maybe because the calf thinks he is under his mother and      feels secure).    </p>    <p>      After a couple of feedings by the "overhead" method      described above, you should be able to hold the bottle      through the fence and feed the young'un in the normal way.      (For me, the "normal way" includes lots of chatter: I      always talk to our babies while I feed them. They quickly      grow accustomed to my voice and seem to grow much better.)    </p>    <h3>      WEANING TO SOLID FOOD    </h3>    <p>      At the end of their first week, I put fresh water out for      our calves and offer them a good-quality, leafy hay or some      alfalfa. Some calves won't eat much at first, but they      should be offered the food anyway.    </p>    <p>      At two weeks, I begin to offer each baby calf starter      pellets (available from any feed store). The calves may      hesitate to eat these at first, but you can "help 'em      along" by putting a few pellets in their mouths after every      bottle feeding. (The sooner the calves begin to eat solid      foods, the sooner you can quit messing with the bottle.)    </p>    <p>      I try to have my young'uns off the bottle by the time      they're four months old. (For the last two weeks, I feed      each one only one bottle a day.) From the third week on, I      keep a block of salt in their pen and watch the babies      carefully so that they don't eat too much of it.    </p>    <p>      As the calves grow, they'll generally do well on a diet of      good hay or alfalfa, ground corn, oats, soybean meal, salt,      and (always) plenty of freshwater. (See the accompanying      chart.)    </p>    <h3>      NUTRITIONAL DIFFICULTIES (AND HOW TO AVOID THEM)    </h3>    <p>      Fortunately, the so-called nutritional diseases of cattle      are seldom fatal ... but they can cause substantial      financial loss due to slow weight gain (not to mention a      great deal of unhappiness on the part of your animals).      Therefore, it pays to know what these diseases are and how      to spot them.    </p>    <p>      Usually-if a good quality of grass, silage, or alfalfa and      grain is available-a calf won't need any supplements      once it has started to eat solid foods. Occasionally,      though, the available grain won't have the vitamin content      it should have (even the best hay will lose its food value      if it's allowed to get wet or moldy, or deteriorate), and      your little ones can begin to develop vitamin A and/or D      deficiencies.    </p>    <p>      Vitamin A deficiency is characterized by rapid breathing,      stiffness, weight loss, appetite loss, swelling of joints,      and (sometimes) convulsions. The calf may begin to show      improvement within minutes after a shot of A, D, and E, if      the problem is acute. Occasionally, however-if the animal's      been on poor-quality feed-two vitamin shots a week apart      will be necessary to get the calf back on its feet. (Moral:      If you suspect poor-quality hay or grain, watch for signs      of vitamin A deficiency.)    </p>    <p>      Although cattle of all ages can suffer from a lack of      vitamin A, younger animals are particularly susceptible      (especially those that are fed skim milk rather than a      highquality milk replacer). Newborn calves are the most      vulnerable, since they do not have a reserve supply of the      vitamin in their bodies. For this reason I give my calves a      shot of A, D, and E vitamins after their first feeding. (I      also add a little powdered A, D, and E to their milk or      water once or twice a month, for added insurance.)    </p>    <p>      Vitamin D is required by calves for the proper absorption      of calcium and phosphorus. Without it, the animals can      develop rickets and/or bumpy knees. One to two pounds of      sun-cured alfalfa per day, however, will prevent rickets in      calves up to 195 days old ... so the deficiency isn't      difficult to cure. The time to watch most sharply for      vitamin D deficiency is winter, when animals don't get much      direct sunlight.    </p>    <p>      If your calves start to chew on bones, rocks, wood, etc.,      they may not be getting enough calcium in their diets. A      good way to supply calcium is to add 40 pounds of finely      ground limestone to each ton of grain.    </p>    <p>      It's also possible-if a calf is fed for too long on milk      without forage or grain-that the animal may become nervous      and irritable and lose its appetite. In this case, the      beast is probably suffering from a magnesium deficiency.      (There's enough magnesium in most forage and grain to      ensure that this condition seldom occurs if the calf is      eating solid food.) Legumes, grass hay, soybean meal, wheat      bran, and beet pulp are all rich in magnesium.    </p>    <p>      Among dietary minerals, iodine is particularly important      since goiters can grow in the throat of an iodine-deficient      calf and choke the animal. In some iodine-scarce areas (and      that includes sections of almost all states west of the      Mississippi), this mineral must be added to calves' (and      people's) diets on a routine basis. Fortunately, this is      easy to do: Simply buy iodized-instead of plain- salt for      your animals.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of salt, calves should consume about 1/4 to 1/2      ounce of sodium chloride per animal per day. If the      young'uns don't get their daily salt, they'll sometimes      overeat and become ill. Always keep a block of salt where      the calves can get at it easily.    </p>    <p>      One nutrition-related disease that can endanger a calf's      life is, grass tetany. This malady occurs when a calf      that's been confined to a small pen on rations of dry hay      is suddenly turned out into a lush, green field. Among the      ailment's symptoms are twitching muscles, grinding teeth,      unusual excitement, nervousness, and cramps. If the disease      is not caught early enough, the period of excitement can be      followed by paralysis, unconsciousness, and death ...      sometimes as quickly as 30 minutes after the first symptoms      are noted.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, grass tetany demands prompt treatment.      Usually, intravenous administration of calcium chloride      solution is recommended. (This is best handled by a      veterinarian.)v None of our animals (luckily) has ever had      grass tetany, but I have seen cattle in a pasture near our      home die of the condition. Here-as always-an ounce of      prevention is worth a pound (at least) of cure. Feed your      young cattle powdered minerals free choice for several      weeks before turning them out into lush pastures, and then      introduce them to the rich forage gradually. Also, watch      for grass tetany if fields have recently turned green after      a good rain.    </p>    <h3>      SOME COMMON ILLNESSES OF CATTLE    </h3>    <p>      It goes without saying that when you acquire your first      bovine bottle baby, you should check with your county agent      or veterinarian to determine which vaccines (if any) are      recommended for cattle in your area ... then have your      young'un vaccinated. This'll take care of most of the      important, life-threatening illnesses with which your calf      may come in contact.    </p>        <p>      Unfortunately for the small holder, there are at least as      many cattle ailments for which no vaccine exists as there      are illnesses of the "immunizable" type. The following      represent some of the more common "non-immunizable"      illnesses that can afflict cattle of all ages.    </p>    <p>      COLDS. I find that if one of my calves gets a runny nose or      shows any other signs of a cold, a scaled-up dose of common      aspirin (to bring down any fever) and a shot of Combiotic      will usually knock the infection right out. In addition, if      the animal has the chills and is shivering, I fix him a      warm toddy consisting of a quarter cup of whiskey, one      ounce of lemon juice, two teaspoons of honey, and an eighth      of a teaspoon of powdered A and D vitamins mixed in one cup      of warm water.    </p>    <p>      LEAD POISONING. Lead kills far more farm animals than any      other metal ... primarily because so many paints contain      lead, and calves like to lick or chew on painted objects.      The symptoms of lead poisoning include drooling, choking,      trembling, and loss of appetite. A purgative dose of Epsom      salts is the most common treatment. The best medicine, of      course, is prevention: Simply keep your calves away from      boards that've been treated with lead-based paints, and you      won't have to worry about lead poisoning.    </p>    <p>      HARDWARE DISEASE. It's a fact: If nuts, bolts, nails,      staples, and other small metallic objects are left around,      they'll often disappear into a calf's stomach. This-in      turn-gives rise to an illness known (appropriately enough)      as "hardware disease", the symptoms of which include pain      and a lack of appetite that's not accompanied by distension      of the stomach. (In advanced cases, labored breathing is      noticeable ... but at that stage of the disease, there's      not much you can do.)    </p>    <p>      If hardware disease is suspected, a vet can place a magnet      in the animal's reticulum (second stomach). The magnet then      remains in the stomach permanently and attracts nails,      staples, etc. (which gather on the magnet rather than      irritating the calf's tissues).    </p>    <p>      To prevent hardware disease, keep your bovines' pens and      grazing areas free of wire, nuts, bolts, screws, and other      metallic objects.    </p>    <p>      PINKEYE is quite common in baby bovines and can afflict      older cattle, too. While not a serious disease, pinkeye is      highly contagious among cattle and does cause a great deal      of discomfort. The main symptom is red, running eyes that      sometimes cake shut. (In severe cases, a white blind spot      may be left on the eye after the disease clears up ...      which is to say, in two or three weeks.)    </p>    <p>      There are several pinkeye medications on the market. When      just one of a calf's eyes is affected, you may want-in      addition to applying medication to tape a patch over the      afflicted eye to protect it from sunlight and (possibly)      keep the disease from spreading to the entire herd.    </p>    <p>      Since flies transmit pinkeye from calf to calf, it's      important to keep the barn and pens clean to hold down the      fly population. We've found that a good way to catch flies      is to set out shallow pans containing a piece of meat (for      bait) and a nicotine sulfate solution (one-half ounce of      the sulfate per gallon of water). (Naturally, we make sure      these pans are out of the reach of children and animals.)    </p>    <p>      WORMS. Cattle can and do get worms, and there are numerous      preparations on the market to kill the parasites. Here      again, prevention (i.e., good management) is the best      medicine. Feed your calves from racks or troughs (not right      off the ground), give them a clean water supply, and rotate      pastures often.    </p>    <p>      BLOAT. If you walk out to the calf pen one morning and find      that your little bovine pal is swollen to twice his normal      girth and has trouble breathing, chances are you're looking      at a case of bloat. If the calf is still on its feet, you      may be able to alleviate the condition by giving the animal      a pint of mineral oil (make sure the oil gets into the      stomach, not the lungs) or by making the calf walk around      for awhile.    </p>    <p>      Many times, however, the bloated bovine will already be      down on the ground with its feet sticking straight out when      you first come on the scene. In this case, there's no time      to lose: The calf's abdominal cavity must be punctured      immediately-either with a knife or a special device called      a trocar-to release the trapped gases. (Otherwise,      the beast may well die from a ruptured stomach or the      shutting off of air to the lungs.) This remedy is known as      "tapping" or "sticking".    </p>    <p>      Point of puncture for bloat: on the left side ...      equidistant from the rearmost rib, the edge of the animal's      loin, and the hip bone.    </p>    <p>      When I come across a calf that's down and almost dead, I      run full speed to the house, grab my paring knife (it's      usually sharp and handy), pour a little alcohol or other      antiseptic on it, and dash back to the calf pen to make the      "tap". (A trocar is nice if you have one ... but in a      life-or-death situation, a paring knife is better than      nothing.) Always remember this: The point of puncture is on      the left side equidistant from the rearmost rib, the edge      of the animal's loin, and the hip bone. (See diagram.) Put      the point of the knife on the puncture site, hold the top      of the knife steady with one hand and hit the knife handle      with the fist of your other hand. (Keep your face well back      when you do this.) I usually leave the knife in place for a      few minutes and move it slightly while I work the      surrounding area with my free hand to aid the release of      gas. After removing the knife, I put antiseptic ointment on      the wound.    </p>    <p>      In the case of a small calf, I usually try to keep the      animal's head elevated (with hay or an old pillow), to      avoid having any stomach fluids escape into the lungs. If      he seems weak, I'll then give the young'un a shot of      Combiotic to ward off infection. I've lost count of how      many calves I've stuck (many of them have belonged to other      people), but so far I haven't lost any animals using this      method.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, there is such a thing as chronic bloat. Epsom      salts and/or mineral oil will relieve the condition, but I      don't know of any permanent cure. (I do know that chronic      bloat will slow down a calf's growth.)-LT.    </p>    <h3>      THE MOST DREADED CALF DISEASE OF THEM ALL: SCOURS    </h3>    <p>      Scours (a kind of diarrhea) comes in a number of varieties:      white, green, black, and bloody. The disorder can be      brought on by any number of upsets, including exposure to      wet and cold, overfeeding, contact with an infected animal,      or a trip through the auction yard.    </p>        <p>      The disease begins with simple diarrhea. Unless this is      stopped at once, the afflicted animal soon begins to pass      yellowish, greenish, or light-brown (and in any case very      foul-smelling) feces. At the same time, the calf becomes      dull and listless, exhibits a below-normal body temperature      (i.e., below 1010 to 103F), experiences dehydration, and      may pass bloody stools. Pneumonia, and death often follow.    </p>    <p>      There are many scour remedies on the market. I have yet,      however, to find one that'll work well after the disease      has become at all advanced, and I have yet to find one that      will nip scours in the bud as well as the "home remedy"      we've used for fifteen years: Whenever I notice that a calf      is passing looser-than-usual feces, I skip the next feeding      of milk. In its place I feed a fluid made by mixing three      tablespoons of pectin (Sure-Jell or Pen Jell) in a cup of      warm water. (Although it tastes terrible, the calf will      usually gulp down at least a cupful of the fluid from a      bottle before it notices.)    </p>    <p>      Once the pectin finds its way to the animal's digestive      tract, it causes the stomach's contents to jell and stops      the cramping. (Of course, if you don't feed the solution      immediately after it's prepared, the pectin will jell in      the bottle instead of in the calf! )    </p>    <p>      An hour after the feeding of pectin-water, give the      afflicted animal half its normal amount of milk,      followed-an hour later-by another serving of pectin      and water. If the condition doesn't clear up in six hours,      administer a shot of Combiotic. Also, add an egg to the      baby's milk at each feeding for a couple of days to give it      extra strength.    </p>    <h3>      LICE (AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM)    </h3>    <p>      Although lice are seldom a problem during the warmer months      of the year, cattle of all ages can (and often do) become      lousy in the fall and winter. Frequently, the parasites are      carried in by birds.    </p>    <p>      Four kinds of lice bother cattle. Three suck blood and the      fourth eats skin and hair. All cause itching and a slowdown      in growth rates.    </p>    <p>      If your mini-herd becomes infested with lice, make up a      delousing medicine by mixing 1-3/4 pounds of rotenone and      one-half pound of detergent with 25 gallons of water ...      then spray your animals with the liquid twice: once now and      again in five to 18 days. (The first bath kills mature lice      and the second gets the newly hatched parasites-or "nits"      -that weren't killed by the initial spraying.) This      treatment will also ward off cattle grubs.    </p>    <h3>      DEHORNING    </h3>    <p>      When you purchase a calf, ask its seller whether the animal      is of a horned breed or a polled (hornless) breed. If the      critter is the horned type-or if you can feel horn buttons      poking through the calf's scalp a few days after you've      taken him home-you'll want to dehorn the little bovine as      soon as possible.    </p>    <p>      The advantages of dehorning are many ... the main one being      safety. Hand-raised calves aren't afraid of humans, and the      tiny calf you're rearing on a bottle will-when it grows to      be a 1,000-pound cow or bull-think nothing of "nudging" you      for attention now and then. If your pet still has horns at      that time, those gentle nudges could well be painful ... or      dangerous. (I know: Several times, our bottle-raised herd      bull has jolted me with his horns ... and made me realize      how dumb I was to let him keep his horns when he was a      little cutie.) In addition, of course, horned cattle tend      to hook each other at the feeding trough, get caught on      fences, etc.    </p>    <p>      The easiest way to prevent horns from appearing is to apply      caustic potash (or a similar substance) to the calf's horn      buttons four to 10 days after birth, or whenever you can      feel horn buttons forming beneath the scalp. Caustic potash      is available at drugstores in both pencil and paste forms.      (CAUTION: Always wear gloves when you work with caustic      potash.)    </p>    <p>      If you can feel a horn button just below the skin, scrape      away the hair covering it and apply a thick layer of      Vaseline to the area around the nub. Then cover the horn      button itself with caustic potash. (The "burn" area should      be about the size of a nickel.) Protect the animal from      rain for the next six to eight hours, or until a scab has      begun to form. The scab should heal completely within a      week to ten days.    </p>    <h3>      CASTRATION    </h3>    <p>      If you intend to raise a bull calf for beef, it'll be      necessary to castrate him. (Neutered males simply "dress      out" better than bulls.) Many folks wait until their bulls      are two or three months old to unsex them, but if the calf      is strong and healthy the operation may be performed a few      days after birth. I find that two or three weeks is a good      age, since the calf is still small enough for easy      handling, yet large enough to withstand the stress of the      operation.    </p>    <p>      The three most-used methods of castration are [1] the      lateral incision method (which is what we use on our farm),      [2] the end incision method, and [3] bloodless      (emasculatome) castration. (Each of these methods is      described in detail in G.W. Stamm's Veterinary Guide for      Farmers, available for $9.95 from any good bookstore or      Mother's Bookshelf (please add 950 for postage and handling      when ordering by mail). Ideally, castration should be done      in early spring before the fly season gets underway, to      minimize the danger of fly-borne infections ... and-for      your own safety-the animal being castrated should be      restrained. If you've never done the operation before, have      a veterinarian (or an experienced herdsman) help you the      first time.    </p>    <h3>      IT'S EASIER THAN YOU THINK TO RAISE YOUR OWN VEAL    </h3>    <p>      If-in the preceding pages-I've given you the      impression that calf raising is an expensive and laborious      undertaking fraught with pitfalls ... believe me, it's not.      We've never regretted having a small herd of the young'uns      around our farm: We've never felt bad, for instance, about      having our own milk cow (hand-raised from the bottle      stage), or our own beef in the freezer ... and the money we      get every fall for the calves that we sell as yearlings      ($2,100 net last year) always comes in mighty handy.    </p>    <p>      I suppose if I had just two words of advice to give to      someone who hasn't yet raised a bottle calf, they'd be:      First, try to get as good a calf as you can find (or      afford) in the beginning. (Later on, you can try your hand      at raising a so-called "bargain" calf.) Second, don't wait      any longer ... do it. You have nothing (except a little      time) to lose ... and a good deal of milk, cream, butter,      yogurt, cheese, beef, extra income, and satisfaction to      gain!    </p>    <p>      For more information on calf rearing, be sure to read Hank      Rate's article-"The One-Cow Family Meets the      One-Family Cow"-in MOTHER NO. 15, pages 48-56, and      "How to Raise a Dairy Calf" by J. Micheal Thompson in      MOTHER NO. 33, pages 60-61.-The Editors.    </p>
