                     <p>      <strong>Janed Schofield</strong>    </p>    <p>      My husband and I had long dreamed of the day when we could      afford to forsake our suburban home and live a simpler      back-to-the-land existence. Then one night-armed with pen      and paper -I decided to actually analyze the economics of      the job that I'd hoped (vainly, it seemed) would help us      someday reach our goal. When my computations were finished,      I stared at the hard, cold facts and made a startling      discovery: I couldn't afford to keep on working!    </p>    <p>      As a teacher, you see, I made $9,000 a year. Yet my actual      <em>spendable income</em> (consisting of net wages minus      work-related expenses) came to only $2,530 annually. I was      truly amazed to learn how much it was costing me to work!      Here's how my income was being distributed:    </p>        <p>      Well, I decided if that was all the further my nine-to-five      routine was getting me, it was time to let go of it.      So-with little hesitation-I did just that! From then      on I managed to augment my husband's salary by cashing in      on my love of horses. My years of training in riding,      combined with my teaching experience, blended to produce a      career-instructing young horsemen and -women-that not      only gave me an income but provided me with lots of outdoor      activity as well. My new "job" also afforded me more      leisure time to develop home and garden skills that helped      to stretch what money I <em>did</em> bring home.    </p>    <p>      What's more, my new occupation eliminated our need for a      second family vehicle ...so I was able to barter my car for      two acres of remote New Hampshire land. Of course, once we      acquired that property, we immediately wanted to relocate      to it ...and upon closer examination of my <em>husband's      earnings,</em> we realized that the idea of simply packing      up and trying to make do in a rural setting wasn't too      farfetched at all!    </p>    <p>      The following list demonstrates how much of his income was      being used each year to do no more than maintain our      (unloved!) lifestyle:    </p>		    <p>      Faced with those facts, we made the decision to abandon our      suburban way of life, so we sold our house and moved onto      the two wholly owned country acres ...on which we built a      small, mortgage free camp. I now cook with bottled gas for      a mere    </p>    <p>      $6.00 a month. Our light is produced by economical kerosene      lanterns. A small barrel stove has taken the place of a      costly oil furnace ...wood-obtained through barter-provides      all our heat ...and a brook on our property supplies all      the water we need.    </p>    <p>      My husband's financed pickup truck (and its accompanying      payments) has been replaced by a used van (completely paid      for) that we've converted into a camper. Soon our annual      budget looked more like this:    </p>		    <p>      As you can see, our change of lifestyle has resulted in our      having more cash to spend than we did before. Best of all,      however, is the fact that we're both finally free of the      40-hour week ...and can devote ourselves full time to      gardening, foraging for wild edibles, fishing, hunting,      writing (which helps pay our bills), and traveling.    </p>    <p>      In fact, our pleasure expenses have actually increased      since our move to the country. For example, at the moment      our camp is rented (providing us with another source of      cash income) while we spend a year traveling in Alaska.      After three months on the road, with our expenses totaling      $2,900 for 12,000 miles of un forgettable experiences,      we're now care taking a remote cabin on the Alaskan coast      ...enjoying the icy splendor of glaciers and snowcaps while      we continue to expand our knowledge and skills.    </p>    <p>      We're living our dream, and all it took was the gumption to      free ourselves of the life we thought we couldn't      <em>afford</em> to leave. You $16,550 know, until we faced      the facts, we never realized the astronomical costs      involved in maintaining a suburban lifestyle.    </p>    <p>      It seems that the solution to money problems sometimes lies      not in earning <em>more,</em> but rather, in simplifying      your way of life ... and perhaps even earning      <em>less.</em> Moving from your present dwelling to a dream      farm or camp in the country-to that place where you can      garden and cut your own wood-may be the answer to      <em>your</em> financial dilemma. In fact, you may be able      to eliminate entirely that tedious 40-hour week, and meet      your reduced expenditures by a part-time or seasonal job,      or a home business.    </p>    <p>      The transition from a life in suburbia to one on the farm      does take time, thought, and money. How much of each you'll      need will, of course, depend on your skills, level of      determination, hoped-for lifestyle, and current equities.      You may have to "cash in" some assets and deplete your      personal savings ...or you may have to devote extra time to      honing a talent that'll net the in- come you'll require, or      to learning the skills necessary to live in harmony with      the earth. Whatever method you adopt to rid your self of      those Monday morning blues, rest assured it <em>can</em> be      done. And the entire process will prove to be an exciting      journey ... one that may far exceed your original dreams.    </p>
