                      <p>      HATE TO DO YARD WORK? ...WELL, READ ON: Maryland      researchers have found that a typical 121-square-meter      suburban lawn consumes the annual food equivalent of      173,000 calories in labor, water, fertilizer, and other      resources ...and estimate that a household could grow 448      pounds of garden produce (including tomatoes, cucumbers,      and potatoes) in the same amount of space, using only half      the energy!<br />      <br />      SUNSET FOR SOLAR ENERGY: The Reagan administration has      dismissed 370 of 959 employees at the Solar Energy Research      Institute (SERI) in Golden, Colorado and has cut the      facility's 1982 budget to E50 million, a 50% reduction from      current spending levels. The budget-slashing is based on      the new policyrnakers' belief that private industry should      fund most solar development work.<br />      <br />      SUBSTANTIAL RESULTS IN ENERGY CONSERVATION-primarily      through voluntary efforts in the private sector-are      occurring faster than anyone would have predicted,      according to a study performed by the Lawrence Berkeley      Laboratory. Conservation measures taken since 1973-almost      entirely in response to economic forces and without      significant government planning-are saving about six      million barrels per day of petroleum, researchers say. The      major gains have been made in energy-conscious housing      design and remedial residential projects, such as      weatherproofing.<br />      <br />      THE BUNNY THERMAL UNIT: A Grants Pass, Oregon man has      combined his rabbit-farming and plant-raising businesses to      produce a hare-heated hothouse. The nursery owner claims      that 500 of the mammals, whose body temperatures average      103°F, are able to warm 25% of his 30,000-square-foot      greenhouse to 88° freezing weather.<br />      <br />      THE NEXT THREE MILE ISLAND? Nuclear Regulatory Commission      officials have pinpointed what they believe will be the      cause of future accidents at nuclear facilities: breaks in      the stout metal jackets that surround the radioactive cores      of older pressurised water reactors. Such containers-which      are the "last line of defense" in averting reactor      mishaps-have become embrittled through repeated bombardment      by neutrons ...and ruptures are likely if the sleeves are      subjected to the stress of emergency core-cooling      procedures.<br />      <br />      NONPOLLUTING MASS TRANSIT: Earth Cycles-a non-profit      organization in Anchorage, Alaska-has started a commuter      bike loan program, letting folks borrow single-speed,      fat-tired bicycles to run errands or to sightsee. The      two-wheelers are checked out on a first come, first served      basis, and each cyclist leaves a refundable $8.00 deposit      and a piece of indentification at the group's      headquarters.<br />      <br />      THE HEAT SPONGE, a thermal storage unit suited for use in      existing structures, gathers surplus daytime heat for      nighttime release in a series of phase-change salt      "shelves" arranged in a cabinet. The inventor says that      five Heat Sponges-which may be plugged into standard      electrical outlets-can save 500 gallons of fuel oil      annually ...when used in a 1,800-square-foot house in the      northeastern United States.<br />      <br />      THE NEW LAND RUSH: It's estimated that 109'0 of all the      frozen food consumed in the U.S. passes through an      18,000,000-square-foot subterranean warehouse complex in      Kansas City, Kansas. Developers of the "underground      industrial park" are having no problem attracting tenants,      since energy bills at the facility range from 40 to 90%      less than they do aboveground ...thanks to the      earth-sheltered facility's stable 88°F ambient air      temperature.<br />      <br />      JEFFERSONIAN SOLAR? The Southern Railway System-which has      successfully experimented with photovoltaic railroad      signals and solar-equipped cabooses-has broken new ground      with the world's first sun-heated freight depot. In an      interesting mix of old and new, architects were able to      design solar features into a building whose appearance is      "in keeping with the Jeffersonian architecture of      Charlottesville, Virginia".<br />      <br />      ENERGY-SAVING PROJECTS FOR THE HOME is a new 112-page      volume containing information on cost-efficient heating and      cooling alternatives for the household. Write ORTHO Books,      Dept. TMEN, Room 3300, 575 Market Street, San Francisco,      California 94105 for more information ... A SOLAR ACCESS      TEST CASE-possibly the first in the nation-will be tried in      Manhattan Beach, California, where the owners of a passive      solar house are seeking to block construction of a      condominium that would, by shading the dwelling for part of      each day, hinder operation of the home's heating and      cooling systems ... A retired New Zealand engineer claims      he can travel 135 miles, in his HYBRID CHARCOAL / GASOLINE      VEHICLE, using only 1-1/2 gallons of fuel and a burnerful      of wattle tree-derived charcoal lumps ... The Department of      Energy has admitted that 11.870 POUNDS OF RADIOACTIVE      URANIUM HAVE BEEN RELEASED ACCIDENTALLY, during the past 36      years, from a government-owned nuclear fuel enrichment      facility near Oak Ridge, Tennessee ... Civic organisations      in San Luis Obispo, California have erected a      PHOTOVOLTAIC-POWERED CLOCK, which has run flawlessly for      more than a year, to promote public education about solar      energy ... Detroit Diesel, a division of General Motors,      has begun the first commercial tests of a machine-suited      for industrial cogeneration applications-that COMBINES      STEAM AND GAS TURBINES. The modified engine raises turbine      efficiency by 30 to 40% ...Ore-Ida-a large food-processing      company-has installed solar systems to heat the oil that      the business uses to cook more than 4,000,000 POUNDS OF      FRENCH FRIES A DAY. The Oregon-based company says that      switching to alternative energy sources has allowed the      firm to cut its energy bill by 16% since 1972 ....even      during    </p>
