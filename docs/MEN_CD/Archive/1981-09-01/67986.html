        <p>This story is strictly for the birds ...and for folks who loved them!</p><p id="byline">It was one of those busy-about-the-house days, and since my little blue parakeet-Boy-dearly loved to stretch his wings, I let the bird loose to fly around while I went about my chores of cake baking, dress remodeling, and sorting out items to take to the Goodwill Industries.</p><p>A few hours later, my sister came by to add her own donations to my Goodwill bundle, and-as she carried the awkward package in-she propped the door open with her foot for a few seconds. You can probably guess what happened next ...the bird saw his chance and-suddenly-he was gone!</p><p>SOMEWHERE ... BLUE BIRDS FLY</p><p>I was frantic. I raced around the front yard, the back yard, and up and down the street calling out, "Boy! Boy! Come here, Boy!" No response. After several futile hours of hunting, I telephoned a few of my neighbors and asked them to please be on the lookout for my pet. Finally, I called the local newspaper to place an ad in the "Lost and Found" column, promising a reward for the parakeet's return.</p><p>That night (as any pet lover will understand), I slept very little. I kept thinking about my lost friend shivering and hungry in some tree or bush. The following day was equally sad. I tried to keep busy, so I wouldn't picture poor Boy alone in the world (at the mercy of the elements and the neighborhood cats), yet the sight of his empty cage would bring tears to my eyes. I hoped that someone would find and take good care of him, even if I never got him back.</p><p>However, I soon learned that I'd underestimated the power of the press ...because-immediately after my ad appeared - eight people called me to report that they'd found the tiny runaway! Delighted but anxious, I opened the door before the first visitor even had time to ring the bell. A very angry peep issued from the paper sack in the stranger's hand ...and 1 knew that voice! We opened the bag and put it up to Boy's cage. Joyfully, I watched the bird scamper out. I spoke to him. "Boy, where have you been?" He cocked his little head to one side in recognition and went right to his seed cup.</p><p>The man refused my reward ...so I thanked him profusely, and-after seeing him to his car-went back to scold my prodigal pet for creating so much trouble and distress.</p><p>TWO'S COMPANY</p><p>About that time, the doorbell rang. I happily answered it, and told the bird-catcher that my parakeet was home safe and sound and that all was well. The woman insisted, however, that I take a look to see whether her find might not actually be the pet I'd lost. Well, I was so pleased at having Boy back that I figured I could afford to humor her, but when we put the blue cheeper in an old cage that Boy had outgrown, I was startled by how much it resembled my bird! A little disconcerted, I called the new arrival "Boy", and-would you believe!-he reacted just as my own parakeet would have. Was it possible, I wondered, that I'd made a mistake?</p><p>"Didn't I tell you it was your bird?" the woman laughed. What could I say? I thanked her and gave her the reward. Then, as I opened the door to bid her goodbye, there stood a bright-eyed lad, and-yes-in his hand he had a sack from which emanated some irritated (and uncannily familiar) cheeps.</p><p>I can only say that, financially, I'm now somewhat poorer than I was a short time ago ...but I'm extremely rich in joy! Eight little parakeets are happily chirping in their new outdoor aviary, and-to this day-I still don't know for sure whether any one of them is Boy.</p>
