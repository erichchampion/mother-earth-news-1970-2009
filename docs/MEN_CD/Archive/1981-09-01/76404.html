        <p>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Inc., P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28791</p><p>In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts regarding one of humankind's better ideas-barter-and offered up an Interesting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied ...and announced our stillstanding offer Anyone (and that means you!) who sends us a short (about 300 words) account of an actual barter that's good enough to print will receive-as the folks on the following page have-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .</p><p>My family's well-endowed cow not only pays her way by filling our larder ...she provides bounty for barter as well!</p><p>Our Brown Swiss/Jersey, you see, produces more milk than our household can consume ...even though we use it in cooking and make our own butter and cheeses. Se-rather than waste the surplus dairy goads-we've developed a convenient swapping system: When any member of the family needs an item purchased or a service rendered, Bony's by-products simply butter the way!</p><p>To date, I've received two beautiful wildlife paintings-from a local barter-minded artist-in exchange for cottage cheese and yogurt ...my daughter's piano lessons are paid for with milt and cream cheese ...ass, as a "beak you" to some neighbors who share their well-kept but outgrown clothing with my brood, I furnish the folks with homemade cheese.</p><p>Everyone involved in our "butter bargaining" circle is satisfied with his or her end of the deal ...and we intend to keep on boding as long as our milk manufacturer will cooperate!</p><p>J.S. Montana</p><p>My wife and I first tried bartering last winter, when our aging pickup needed some extensive repairs. We own a small stove store, you see, and found ourselves with a greater supply of woodburners than of ready cash.</p><p>A small ad in the local newspaper-backed up with some word-of-mouth advertising-soon brought an able mechanic to our shop ...and he was more than happy to rebuild our vehicle's engine in exchange for a brand-new woodburner. After that initial success, we were hooked! We next traded a second stove for body work and a paint job on the same trusty truck ...while yet another bartering deal landed us a rifle as downpayment on a third heater.</p><p>We're so pleased with the results of swapping that we're now actively seeking sit a trader with a cold house and a spare motorcycle, and next year we may exchange a greenhouse or solar collector system for a homestead tractor.</p><p>We've found barter agreements to be the most satisfying "sales" of all bringing us many new friends while helping us obtain needed goods and services during tough economic times.</p><p>R.G.<br />Illinois</p><p>The fine art of bartering has enhanced our Alaskan bush Vie and is often about the only way to purchase things here in the far North. This past year, for example, my husband and I exchanged carpentry work for a snug winter's lodging, and-as the cold season tightened its icy grip-we traded food supplies with other snowbound dolts. Since the nearest grocery store is 35 tulles down river by dogsled-swaps such as a taw jars of high-bush cranberry jelly for a tin or two of salmon have, in these parts, long been a common way of adding variety to winter meals.</p><p>We barter for services as well: A refinished rifle stock paid a buddy of ours for delivering the winter mail, and we used a walrus tusk to hire an airplane for a midwinter trip from tile bush to town and back. During the spring, friends boarded our dabs for a month in exchange for a week of our help in finishing a greenhouse and starting a log sauna. And our part in the group effort that helped a neighbor move nine birch trees from the forest to a boat was repaid when the same work crow helped us lower our fishing vessel down the steep riverbank to the water.</p><p>We're looking forward to yet another season of swapping, too ...because we've discovered that trading has magic that tar surpasses the lure of cold cash.</p><p>C.F.<br />Alaska</p><p>Living in an urban apartment saves me a lot of tame and money, since I can "hoof it" to my nearby workplace. Still, I'd always longed for enough garden space to let me grow a wide variety of vegetables (an Impossibility in the postage stamp-sized plot allotted by the landlord). How I yearned to plant a taw of the new hybrids! But although the R.G. unfamiliar (at least to me) vegetables Illinois such as spaghetti squash- were tantalizing, I was reluctant to commit even a corner of my precious apace to any crop other than the "old favorites": peas, beans, and tomatoes.</p><p>So when one of my co-workers lamented that he loved garden-fresh produce but had neither the time nor the expertise to prepare and cultivate a growing plot on his unused land, I immediately suggested a swap: my labor and experience in exchange for the use of his acreage. Well, he enthusiastically agreed to the deal ...and so did several other folks in the neighborhood.</p><p>The members of our new-found "garden club" shared the initial heavy work of clearing and tilling, and later we split the cost of the supplies. Since then, I've embarked on my "garden beat" every Saturday morning ...sad a few hours of labor keeps !he four plots I'm now responsible !or weed-free. Then, as each crop is harvested, I take hems half of the produce ...a share which provides me with plenty of fresh vegetables, and an ample supply for causing as well.</p><p>As you might guess, I'm as contented as a brown bear is a blueberry patch ... and I'm especially pleased that the gardening deal has treated our group of "cliff dwellers" to s beach of country neighborliness.</p><p>R.C.<br />Pennsylvania</p><p>With "extra" money being virtually nonexistent in our household, try friend and I hadn't been able to indulge is one of our favorite pastimes: traveling. But then our sightseeing urge was fullfilled in a way that we hadn't ever Imagined!</p><p>A buddy of ears dad quit his factory job to make a career as a cross-country tractor-trailer jockey ...and whenever he was in our area, the wandering track er would stop by and hill our evening hours with tales of places he had been. Finally we realized that <em>he</em> was our tick et to adventure!</p><p>Our long-haul friend, you see, needed helping hands to load, unload, and secure the freight in his rig ...and we want ed to see some new sights. So (and what could be more fitting?.) we simply traded our labor for a free ride and a guided tour of the country!</p><p>D.H.<br />Indiana</p><p>About two years ago my wife and I bought a small "dream farm" in the Aloha State. However, since we spent practically all of our savings to purchase our new homestead, we were in a quandary as to how we could ever afford to get the land planted.</p><p>After a few months in our new home, though, we noticed that many of the nearby fields of bananas, taro, and bam boo had become so overgrown that the plants were actually strangling one an other. A trifle apprehensively, we approached the next-farm neighbors with the Idea of a trade: We would thin their crops and accept rootstock in return for the labor.</p><p>It's been over a year now since that swap began ...and our new friends have manageable fields, while our plantings, in turn, are well on their way to be coming overgrown!</p><p>D.R.<br />Hawaii</p>
