                <p>      Here's the information you'll need to determine whether      wind energy can trim your use of conventional sources of      power.    </p>             <p>      Text and charts from The Wind Power Book by Jack Park,      copyright Â© 1981 by the author and Cheshire Books.      Reprinted by permission of the author and Cheshire Books.    </p>    <p>      Harnessing the wind is a fantastically appealing idea.      Anyone who's stepped out into a howling autumn blow knows      instinctively-that there's tremendous power in the      movement of air, but the would be windplant owner must      decide whether his or her area has enough wind year round      to justify the expense of such a system.    </p>    <p>      Windplant designer and builder Jack Park owner of Helion      Inc., president of the American Wind Energy Association,      and author-has addressed that subject in a new text      ...The Wind Power Book. It is-in the opinion of      MOTHER's technical staff-the clearest, most      understandable explanation yet of the factors that anyone      must consider before either purchasing or constructing a      wind energy system.    </p>    <p>      In fact, we were sufficiently impressed <em>by</em> the      <em>book</em> to secure the right to reprint a portion of      the volume's introduction ...which we hope will help to      give everyone who reads it a sound understanding of the      whys and wherefores of wind power.    </p>    <p>      THE USES OF WIND POWER    </p>    <p>      Today, the wind can be harnessed to provide some or all of      the power for many useful tasks such as pumping water,      generating electricity, and heating a house or barn. Let's      examine a few of these more closely.    </p>        <p>      Pumping water is a primary use of wind power. Daniel      Halliday and others began manufacturing multi-bladed      windmills for this purpose in the mid-nineteenth century.      Halliday's work coincided with advancements in the iron      water-pump industry. Soon the combination of wind machines      and iron water-pumps made it possible to pump deep wells      and provide the water for steam locomotives chugging across      the North American plains. The demand for windpowered      deep-well pumps created a booming windpower industry at the      turn of the century. Sears sold those machines for about      $15, $25 for a tower.    </p>    <p>      The wind has also been harnessed to provide mechanical      power for grain grinding, sawmill operation, and even      driving a washing machine. While I don't envision next      year's Kenmore washing machine to come complete with a      tower, blades, and drive shaft in lieu of an electric cord      and plug, mechanical power from a wind machine can prove      useful.    </p>    <p>      Electricity can power just about anything, and its      generation from wind power seems to grab the lion's share      of attention. You can pump water, run washing machines,      grind grain, heat houses, and read books if you have      electric power. As soon as electric generators from old      cars became available, farmers started building "light      plants", or homemade wind generators. Such early mechanics      magazines as Popular Science and Modern Mechanix      demonstrated how to convert waterpumping windmills into      wind chargers by using junked generators, bicycle chains,      and the family wind machine.    </p>    <p>      Many Midwest farmers already had gasoline or kerosene      generators to charge their batteries, and the addition of      wind power helped reduce fuel costs and wear-and-tear on      generators. Out of all of this backyard activity grew the      pre-REA windcharger industry. Some half-million wind      systems once existed in the United States alone, but it's      not clear from historical records whether this number      includes the water pumpers along with the wind chargers.    </p>    <p>      Farmers used wind-generated electricity to power a radio,      one or two lights for reading, eventually an electric      refrigerator or a wringer washing machine, and not much      else. Electric irons for pressing clothes, electric      shavers, and other gadgets built to run on direct current      appeared, but most of these proved unrealistic uses for      wind-generated electric power. In fact, they may have      contributed to the demise of wind electricity when rural      electrification began. Electric appliances performed much      better on an REA line, which wasn't subject to dead      batteries. "Let's go over to the Joneses, Pa. They got one      of them new powerlines. Maybell says her refrigerator don't      defrost no more!"    </p>    <p>      Rural electrification put numerous wind chargers out of      business. In the Midwest you can drive for miles on an      empty dirt road, following a long electric powerline to      only one, or perhaps two, homes at the end of the road.      Leave one road and follow the next. It's the same story.      REA lines were installed and wind generators came down.      Sears catalogs touted all the marvelous gadgets one could      buy and plug into the newly installed powerline.    </p>    <p>      Electric stoves, hot curlers, electric air conditioners,      two or more televisions ...these aren't very realistic      loads to place on a wind-charged battery. However, wind      power <em>can</em> contribute to the operation of these      devices, especially if grid power is already doing part of      the job. With such <em>cogeneration</em> (wind power used      together with grid power), the more wind power available,      the less grid power needed.    </p>    <p>      In another application, wind power can provide heat for      warming our households, dairy-barn hot water, or just about      anything else for which heat is used as long as the heat is      not needed in a carefully controlled amount. This wind      heating concept is called the <em>wind furnace,</em> and      it's one of our most useful applications of wind power.      Wind furnaces can use windgenerated electricity to produce      the heat, or they can convert mechanical power into heat      directly.    </p>    <p>      ENERGY BUDGETS    </p>    <p>      Wind machine design must begin with a realistic assessment      of energy needs and available wind resources. When      confronted by inexperienced people observing my wind      machine, I'm asked most often, "Will it power my house?"      Taking this question to its most outrageous extreme, I'm      often tempted to reply, "Just how fast would you like your      house to go?" But usually I just ask, "How much power do      you need at your house?" Blank stares, mumbled confusion,      sometimes ignorant silence follow. Then, "Well, will it      power the average house?"    </p>    <p>      Apparently many people would like to install a $1,000 wind      machine and "switch off" good old Edison. This is a      fantasy. It might be reasonable to use the wind to power      your house if old Edison is a $30,000 powerline away from      your new country home, but most end uses for wind power      will be somewhat less extravagant.    </p>    <p>      A successful windpower system begins with a good      understanding of the intended application. For example,      should you decide that water pumping is the planned use,      you must determine how high the water must be lifted and      how fast the water must flow to suit your needs. The force      of the wind flowing through the blades of a windmill acts      on a water pump to lift water. The weight of the water      being lifted and the speed at which the water flows      determine the power that must be delivered to the pump      system. A deeper well means a heavier load of water      ...speeding up the flow means more water to be lifted per      second. They both mean more power required to do the job,      or a larger <em>load.</em>    </p>    <p>      This concept of load is crucial to the understanding of      wind power. Imagine that instead of using a windmill you      are tugging on a rope to lift a bucket of water from the      well. This lifting creates a load on your body. Your      metabolic processes must convert stored chemical energy to      mechanical energy. The <em>rate</em> at which your body      expends this mechanical energy is the <em>power you</em>      are producing. The weight (in pounds) of the bucket and the      rate (in feet per second) at which you are lifting it      combine to define the power (in foot-pounds per second)      produced. How long you continue to produce that power      determines the total amount of mechanical energy you have      produced.    </p>    <p>      The kind of application you have in mind pretty clearly      defines the load that you'll place on your windpower      system. Knowing something about that load will allow you to      plan an <em>energy budget.</em> "What the #$Â°/a&,"      you ask, "is an energy budget?" Let's explain that with an      analogy.    </p>    <p>      When you collect your paycheck, you have a fixed amount of      money to spend. You probably have a budget that allocates      portions of your money to each of the several bills you      need to pay. With any luck, something is left over for      savings, a few beers, or whatever else you fancy. Energy      should be managed the same way, and if you live with wind      power for very long, you'll soon set up an energy budget.    </p>    <p>      Setting up an energy budget involves estimating,      calculating, or actually measuring the energy you need for      the specific tasks you have in mind. If you plan to run      some electric lights, you must estimate how many, how long,      and at what wattage. If you plan to run a radio for three      hours each evening, you'll have to add that amount of      electrical energy to your budget. If you want to pump      water, you should start with estimates of how much water      you need per day and calculate how much energy is required      to pump that much water from your well into the storage      tank.    </p>    <p>      Wind furnaces require that you calculate the amount of heat      needed. In some cases, you need to calculate only the heat      required to replace the heat lost from your house when it's      windy. Such a system works only when it's needed. Your      energy budget will now be in heat units, probably British      Thermal Units (BTU) ...which can easily be converted to      horsepower-hours (HPH) or to kilowatt-hours (KWH): energy      units more familiar to wind machine designers.    </p>    <p>      Your utility bills and the equipment you already own will      help define your energy needs. For example, average      electrical energy consumption in U.S. residences is around      750 KWH per month, or about one kilowatt-hour per hour. Or,      more specifically, most residential well pumps are rated at      one to three horsepower. You can easily determine how long      your pump runs and arrive at the total energy required per      day, per week, or per month. In short, you really need to      get a handle on your energy needs before you can proceed to      the design of a windpower system.    </p>    <p>      WIND RESOURCES    </p>    <p>      You will also need to determine your energy paycheck. There      are two possible approaches: [1] Go to the site where you      intend to install the wind machine and analyze the wind      resource, or [2] go searching for the best wind site you      can find. The former approach is more direct. You own some      property, there is only one clear spot, and that's where      the tower will be planted ... along with your hopes for a      successful project. The latter approach offers more avenues      for refinements and better chances for success. In any      event, the larger the paycheck, the less strain on your      energy budget ...and the smaller and less efficient a      windmill needs to be.    </p>    <p>      In either approach you need to measure, estimate, or      predict how much wind you can expect at your chosen site.      I've talked with folks who claimed to be wind witchers,      possessing the ability to use a wet index finger and      predict the windspeed with great accuracy. I've talked with      people who installed wind generators back in the days      before rural electrification. Most of these machines were      installed in areas now known to be quite windy, with      average windspeeds of 14 to 16 miles per hour (MPH). When      asked, these folks almost always guessed that the wind      averaged 30 MPH or more. Those old wind chargers were      installed haphazardly. "Heck, anywhere you stick one, it      will work just fine."    </p>    <p>      Once you have established an energy budget, you have      effectively established a standard for the performance of      your windpower system. That puts you in a different league      from the pre-REA folks. Your system will be good if it      meets the energy budget. Theirs was good because it was all      they had. Your site analysis should be careful and      conservative. If it is, the wind system you plan will      probably serve its purpose. If not, you'll have to be happy      with what you get, just like the folks be fore the REA. As      you gain familiarity with your system, you might learn how      to save a little power for later. Or maybe you'll build a      larger wind machine because you like wind power so much.    </p>    <p>      From an engineering standpoint, the available wind power is      proportional to the cube of the windspeed. Put another way,      if the windspeed doubles, you can get eight times the wind      power from it ...unless the tower collapses. If you are off      by a factor of two on your windspeed estimate, you'll be      off by a factor of eight on the power you think is coming      to you. Remember those farmers who guessed their average      windspeed to be 30 MPH, although it's been measured at      around 15 MPH. A factor of two.    </p>    <p>      Folks who have lived in an area for a long time can usually      tell you what seasons are windy and the direction of the      wind during those seasons. But they're not very good at      estimating windspeeds. You'll have to measure the windspeed      yourself, or use some accurate methods to estimate it.    </p>    <p>      SYSTEM DESIGN    </p>    <p>      Once you have established your energy budget and collected      adequate wind resource data, you can begin the task of      system design. Whether you intend to de sign and build the      windmill yourself, assemble one from a kit, or buy one off      the shelf, these are necessary preliminaries. Too      frequently, designers disregard energy budget and site      analysis. Instead, they make arm-waving assumptions on the      use of the wind machine and where it might be installed,      and use other criteria like cost as the design goal. Some      of the best wind machines on today's market have been      designed this way, but it's very important to recognize      that most manufacturers of mass-produced wind machines have      left the tasks of energy budget and site analysis up to the      buyer. The information provided in later chapters of The      <em>Wind Pow</em> er <em>Book</em> will help you make these      analyses <em>before you</em> select a factory-built wind      machine suited to your needs or set about designing and      building your own system.    </p>        <p>      A thorough energy budget should tell you something about      the time of day, week, or month when you need certain      amounts of energy and power. For example, if everybody in      your house rises at the same time each morning, your      electric lights, hot curlers, coffeepot, television set,      toaster, stove, water heater, and room heaters probably      become active all at the same time. An enormous surge in      electricity use occurs ...the same problem Edison has.      Their generators idle along all night doing virtually      nothing until everybody wakes up at once. If you had a wind      electric system, it would be really nice if the wind at      your site were strongest when the loads on the system were      greatest. Chances are, though, that your consumption      doesn't coincide with the windSo, you can either try to      synchronize your loads with the wind or store      wind-generated energy until you need it.    </p>    <p>      The methods of energy storage are legion, but only a few      are practical. If wind is being used to pump water, your      energy storage might be a familiar old redwood water tank.      Electrical storage has traditionally taken the form of      batteries ...still the most reasonable means of storage in      many installations. Cogeneration allows you to send      wind-generated electricity out to utility lines (running      the meter backward) when you don't need it all. In effect,      old Edison becomes the energy storage for the wind system.    </p>    <p>      There are a number of exotic ways one might choose to store      excess wind energy. You might dynamite an enormous mine      under your house and pump it up with air from a      wind-powered compressor. This compressed air can then power      a small generator, sized for your loads, as well as provide      aeration for the tropical fish tank. If you own enough      land, you can bulldoze a large lake and pump water up to it      with wind power. A small hydroelectric turbine will produce      electricity as you need it. In fact, you might sink two      telephone poles out in the yard and use a wind-powered      motor to power a hoist, lifting a '56 Oldsmobile up to 100      feet. As it descends, the motor that lifted it becomes a      generator. Such a mechanism could provide you with 500      watts of electricity for about 15 minutes ... maybe enough      to burn the toast! There are as many possibilities for      energy storage as there are crackpot inventors around, and      some of these possibilities are just as crazy.    </p>    <p>      Some systems provide energy storage as an inherent part of      the design. The wind furnace, where wind power is being      used exclusively for heat production, is a good example.      Heat storage is energy storage: You may store energy by      heating water, rocks, or a large building with the excess      heat. But probably you'll be heating with wind power when      you need heat the most. Wind chill can draw heat from a      house much more quickly than heat loss occurs under no-wind      conditions. So little, if any, storage would be necessary.    </p>    <p>      But for most applications, some energy storage is      mandatory.    </p>    <p>      Wind system design is a process of balancing energy needs      against wind energy availability. Besides picking a good      site and buying or building the right wind machine, you      have to select a suitable storage system, plan all wiring      or plumbing, build a tower, support it with guy wires, and      get building permits and neighbor approval. This design      process can be conveniently summarized in the accompanying      flow chart. To follow this chart, you start where it seems      appropriate and follow the arrows, completing the task in      each box before proceeding to the next. The remainder of      The <em>Wind Power Book is</em> organized to help you use      this flowchart in your design process. Whether you intend      to design and build the entire system or just to assemble      it from factory-built parts, a systematic approach will      help you achieve a windpower system worthy of your efforts.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Paperback copies of The Wind Power Book by      Jack Park can be purchased from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.      Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791 for $11.95      each. Another book that should definitely be a part of any      prospective windpower user's library is a new treatise by      Donald Marier (editor of Alternative Sources of Energy      magazine) called Wind Power for the Homeowner: A Guide to      Selecting, Siting, and Installing an Electricity-Generating      Wind Power System ...also available-for $12      .95-from Mother's Bookshelf. (Please include 95d for      shipping and handling.)    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>ENERGY AND POWER</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      A clear distinction must be made between energy and power      ...two different but closely related quantities. Briefly,      power is the rate at which energy is extracted, harnessed,      converted, or consumed. It equals the amount of energy per      unit time, or    </p>    <p>      <em>Power =</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Energy</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Time</em>    </p>    <p>      An equivalent relation between these entities is    </p>    <p>      <em>Energy =Power X Time</em>    </p>    <p>      The amount of energy extracted or consumed is therefore      proportional to the elapsed time. For example, a typical      light bulb draws 100 watts of electrical power. One watt (1      W) is the basic unit of power in the metric system, Leave      the light bulb on for two hours, and it will consume 200      watt-hours (100 watts times 2 hours equals 200 watt- hours,      or 200 WH). Leave it on for ten hours, and it consumes      1,000 watt-hours, or one kilowatt-hour (1 KWH), the more      familiar metric unit.    </p>    <p>      In the English system, energy is measured in foot-pounds,      British Thermal Units, and a host of other units that don't      concern us here. One foot-pound (1 ft.-lb.) is the amount      of mechanical energy needed to raise one pound one foot      high. One British Thermal Unit <em>(1</em> BTU) is the      amount of thermal energy needed to heat one pound of water      1Â°F. Power is most often measured in horsepower and in      BTU per hour. One horsepower (1 HP) is the power required      to raise a 550pound weight one foot in one second:    </p>    <p>      <em><em>1 horsepower</em> = 500</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Foot-Pounds</em></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Second</em></em>    </p>    <p>      Note that the units of power are expressed in units of      energy per time, as one would expect.    </p>    <p>      Conversions between metric and English units require that      you know a few conversion factors, For example, one      horsepower equals 746 watts ...and one kilowatt-hour is      equal to 3,413 BTU. Thus,    </p>    <p>      <em>100 W =</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>100</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>HP= 0.134 HP</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>746</em>    </p>    <p>      <br />    </p>    <p>      <em><em>10,000 BTU</em> =</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>10,000</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>KWH 3, 413</em></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>3,413</em>    </p>    <p>      Rarely is it a simple task to estimate the wind energy      available at a particular site ...the windspeed is      constantly changing. During one minute, 300 watts of power      may be generated by a windmill, or 300 watt-minutes of      energy (which equals 5 WH). During the next minute the wind      may die, and you get absolutely no energy or power from the      machine. The power output is constantly changing with the      windspeed, and the accumulated wind energy is increasing      with time. The wind energy extracted by the machine is the      summation or total of all the minute-by-minute (or whatever      other time interval you care to use) energy contributions.      For example, if there are 30 minutes during a particular      hour when the windmill is generating 5 WH and another 30      minutes when there is no energy generated, then the machine      generates 150 WH (5 X 30 = 150) of wind energy. If there      are 24 such hours a day, then 3,600 WH or 3.6 KWH are      generated that day.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>WIND ENERGY AND WIND      POWER</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Energy and power are derived from the wind by making use of      the force it exerts on solid objects, pushing them along.      Buildings designed to stand still against this force      extract very little energy from the wind. But windmill      blades are designed to move in response to this force, and      wind machines can extract a substantial portion of the      energy and power available.    </p>    <p>      The wind energy available in a unit volume (one cubic foot      or one cubic meter) of air depends only upon the air      density p (Greek "rho") and the instantaneous windspeed V.      This "kinetic energy" of the air in motion is given by the      formula    </p>    <p>      <em>Kinetic Energ y</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>= 1/g X p X V'</em></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Unit Volume</em></em>    </p>    <p>      To find the kinetic energy in a particular volume of air,      you just multiply by that volume. The volume of air that      passes through an imaginary surface -say the disk      swept out by a horizontal-axis windmill oriented at right      angles to the wind direction is equal to    </p>    <p>      <em>Volume- A X V X t</em>    </p>    <p>      where t is the elapsed time (in seconds) and A is the area      (in square feet or square meters) of the surface in      question. Thus, the wind energy that flows through the      surface during time t is just    </p>    <p>      <em>Available Energy = 1/2 X p X V 3 X A X t</em>    </p>    <p>      Wind power is the amount of energy which flows through the      surface per unit time, and is calculated by dividing the      wind energy by the elapsed time t. the fraction of the wind      power avail Thus, the wind power available under able that      is actually delivered to a load the same conditions as      above is given or to a storage device by the formula    </p>    <p>      <em>Available Power = 1/2 X</em> P <em>X V 3 X A</em>    </p>    <p>      Both energy and power are proportional to the cube of the      windspeed.    </p>    <p>      If all the available wind power working against a windmill      rotor could be harvested by the moving blades, this formula      could be used directly to calculate the power extracted.      But getting such an output would require that you stop the      wind dead in its tracks and extract every last erg of its      kinetic energy. This is an impossible task. Some non-zero      windspeed must occur downstream of the blades to carry away      the incoming air, which would otherwise pile up. Under      ideal conditions, the maximum power that can be extracted      from the wind is only 59.3 percent of the power available,      or    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Maximum Power =</em></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>0.593</em> <em>X p X V 3 X A</em></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>2</em>    </p>    <p>      In practice, a wind machine extracts substantially less      power than this maximum. For example, the windmill rotor      itself may capture only 70% of the maximum power. Bearings      will lose another few percent to friction ...generators,      gears, and other rotating machinery can lose half of      whatever power remains. Pushrods, wires, batteries, and      monitoring devices will lose still more. The overall      "system" efficiency of the entire wind machine is the      fraction of the wind power available that is actually      delivered to a load or to a storage device:    </p>    <p>      <em>Efficiency =</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><em>Power Delivered</em></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Available Power</em>    </p>    <p>      Thus, the power extracted by a particular wind machine with      system efficiency E is given by the formula    </p>    <p>      <em>Extracted Power = 1/2 X p X</em> <em>V 3</em> X A X E    </p>    <p>      The final output of a wind machine is greatly reduced from      the power that is really available in the wind. In      practice, values of E commonly range from 0.10 to 0.50,      although higher and lower values are possible.    </p>    <p>      One more factor is needed before the formula above can be      used in your calculations . . a conversion factor, K, that      makes the answer come out in the appropriate units, whether      metric or English (see chart below).    </p>					<p>      The final formula combines everything so far presented:    </p>    <p>      <em>Power =1/2 X p X</em> <em>V 3</em> X A X E X K    </p>    <p>      This is a very important formula ...perhaps the most      important in <em>The Wind Power Book.</em>    </p>
