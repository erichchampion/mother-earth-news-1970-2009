        <p><em>The worldwide organization called Friends of the Earth is one of the most effective environmental groups in existence today, and the activities of FOE-along with a broad range of other news concerning ecological developments - are described each month in its publication titled</em> Not Man Apart <em>. You can become a member of Friends of the Earth, and receive the excellent tabloid by sending $25 ($12 for students and retired people) - or $15 for a subscription only - to FOE, Dept. TMEN, 1045 Sansome Street, San Francisco, California 94111. And to increase the reach of the organization's doings, we've arranged to bring you this bi-monthly column, which is prepared by the staff of FOE/NNMA.</em></p><p><strong>CONGRESS GETS A LITTLE GREENER</strong></p><p>You couldn't call it a landslide by any means, but the first major environmentalist foray into national electoral politics produced many satisfying victories, a few disappointing losses, and a determination to do even better next time.</p><p>The Friends of the Earth Political Action Committee, to take one handy (and perhaps slightly self-congratulating) example, supported a total of 48 candidates in 25 states. Of these, 34 - or 70% - won, and in many cases the environmental support played a <em>big part</em> in the victories.</p><p>The most dramatic win took place in New Mexico, where incumbent Republican Senator Harrison Schmitt was defeated by Jeff Bingaman, the state's Attorney General. Environmentalists put 1,500 volunteers into the Bingaman campaign, setting the stage for one of the biggest upsets of this election.</p><p>In other key contests, environmentalists were credited with saving Republican Senator Bob Stafford of Vermont in a tough primary . . . and then with helping him prevail in the general election. Stafford is a champion of clean air, and one of the few high-ranking Republican members of the Senate sympathetic to environmental concerns.</p><p>The biggest <em>disappointment</em> occurred in California, where governor Jerry Brown - running with enthusiastic environmental backing - lost his race for the U.S. Senate.</p><p>However, Congressman Philip Burton - a San Francisco Democrat and one of the best friends environmentalists have in Washington - won what the newspapers called "the toughest race of his long career". With the help of determined environmentalist support, Burton overcame a heavily financed campaign mounted by a popular Republican state senator.</p><p>In other election news, the nuclear-freeze initiative won in eight of nine states (only Arizona defeated it), but container-deposit initiatives <em>lost</em> in four of five states (a bottle bill <em>was</em> approved in Massachusetts).</p><p>One odd note: Berkeley, California environmentalists have been battling among themselves over two seemingly good ideas. The city fathers (and mothers) are favoring a plan to burn garbage to generate electricity, which sounds fine . . . especially since Berkeley's refuse currently gets dumped along the shore of San Francisco Bay. But others now claim that the "burn plant" would be wasteful of resources. It would be much better, they say, to separate the various elements of the trash . . . to be reused as fertilizer, building material, etc. What's more, they point out that an uncontrollable conglomeration of discarded matter would be incinerated, letting lord-knows-what out into the atmosphere through the smokestack. So the "anti" faction proposed a five-year moratorium on any garbage-burning facility in Berkeley . . . and it passed with 60% of the vote.</p><p><strong>BAD NEWS FOR WHALES</strong></p><p>Last summer (as reported in this publication) the International Whaling Commission voted, by a whopping 25-to-7 margin, to ban commercial whaling . . . starting at the end of the 1985 season. Conservationists rejoiced, but then the wait began. Would - we all wondered - the whaling nations, and Japan in particular, go along with the ban?</p><p>Under the commission's rules, it seems, any country that disagrees with any of the adopted resolutions has simply to say so . . . and then won't be <em>bound</em> by the ruling! And if Japan, or any of the seven other whaling nations, were to object (or to resign from the commission, as some have threatened to do), then the spotlight would turn to Washington, D.C. and to two fairly new - and never invoked - laws that empower the U.S. government to impose fisheries sanctions on any countries that "impair the effectiveness" of an international fisheries convention. In other words, if a nation refuses to go along with the whaling ban, the United States can force that land's ships to stay beyond our 200-mile zone . . . and can even suspend imports of fish and fish products from the offending country into the U.S.</p><p>As the 90-day grace period wound down, the smart money was betting that Japan would <em>not</em> object. But smart money, this time, was wrong. At the last minute (on election day, in fact, perhaps in an attempt to blunt the impact of the announcement), Japan and Norway declared their intention to file objections to the ban. This column was written before the U.S. had had time to react formally to the announcement of the objections. Conservationists expressed distress at the news, and - of course - planned to press the administration to invoke sanctions swiftly and surely. The whaling story, alas, is far from ended.</p><p><strong>HERBICIDE AWARENESS</strong></p><p>Judging from the mail that comes into FOE headquarters in San Francisco, the indiscriminate use of herbicides is one of the fastest-growing issues in the country, particularly in the Southeast. Here are two examples: Citizens are up in arms in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after having found out that the TVA has been spraying the weed-killer called 2,4-D (related to Agent Orange, and linked to spontaneous abortions in some areas of the country) into their drinking-water reservoirs for the past 20 years. Another flap is going on in Moundville, Alabama, where residents are trying to stop their power company from spraying another dangerous poison onto their right-of-ways. If you know of further pesticide abuses and efforts to stop them, please inform Bob Scowcroft - of FOE's San Francisco office - about them.</p><p><strong>A WIN FOR WILDLIFE</strong></p><p>Early in the year it seemed as if the Reagan administration would go all out to gut - or even kill - the Endangered Species Act: the law that protects rare animals, plants, birds, fishes, and their habitats. But as election day drew closer, and the mood of the public began to be measured, the administration began pulling back, until - at the end - a <em>strengthened</em> Endangered Species Act passed with almost no opposition!</p><p><strong>BREEDER SQUEAKER</strong></p><p>For ten years now, environmentalists have been trying to kill a project that would result in the construction of a demonstration breeder reactor on the Clinch River in Tennessee. And in September <em>they</em> almost won. The reactor-that-produces-more-fuel-than-it-uses (in theory, at least) escaped timely death by <em>a single vote</em> in the U.S. Senate. Breeder opponents vowed to finish the job during the lame-duck session of Congress late this year.</p>
