                <p>      <em>If you gather a few odds and ends, you can "make light"      of our latest in "current" events:</em>    </p>            <p>      Any piece of handwork can be a source of pride for the doer      and of inspiration for the admirer. Moreover, when art      serves a purpose beyond its aesthetic value, it can become      even more worthwhile . . . and our unusual heat-circulation      lamp is a good case in point.    </p>    <p>      The unit is really nothing more than a copper shade that's      fitted with a bulb and a perforated light shield . . . but      just <em>below</em> that tungsten globe hangs a muslin      "sock" - a tube about eight inches in diameter and      six feet long - which has a small electric fan housed      in its foot.    </p>    <p>      And, as noted above, there are practical reasons for this      attractive combination of components. Besides providing      warm, diffused illumination, you see, the fixture draws hot      air from the ceiling area (where it naturally collects) and      pumps it down to floor level (where chilly drafts seem to      run rampant). So the device not only makes efficient use of      available warmth - increasing the usable heat      provided by your woodstove, for instance - but      furnishes some degree of air circulation, too.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER'S research director, Emerson Smyers, came up with      the idea while reminiscing about the old-limey paddle fans      that graced many a residence and public place not too long      ago (and have recently made quite a comeback). "Most people      think they were there for cooling, but they're only half      right . . . those big blades did a heck of a job      circulating heat, too, and anyone who doesn't believe it      should take a closer look at some of the original models.      Many actually had resistance elements built right around      the motor housing that could be switched on in the winter      to throw off additional warmth."    </p>    <p>      In an effort to adapt that technology, Emerson merely      designed a more compact package and placed his fan (which      uses about one-quarter the energy required by its      predecessors) out of view. The result - which would      cost about $45 if all new parts were used (naturally, we      scrounged some of ours) - required a 19" X 27" sheet      of 16-ounce copper (this item can be purchased as scrap for      a couple of dollars), a porcelain socket fixture with a      threaded mounting stud, a swag light kit with a switch, a      150-CFM (cubic-foot-per-minute) 8"-diameter circular fan      (available from Solar Usage Now, Dept. TMEN, Box 306,      Bascom, Ohio 44809 . . . write for catalog ordering      information, or use any comparable muffin fan and adapt the      design to fit it), about a foot of 1/4"-loop wire chain, 2      yards of muslin cloth, three lengths of copper-coated 1/8"      welding rod, 8 feet of speaker wire, seven 1/2" plastic      tether rings, a 4" X 27" scrap of sheet metal and a piece      of foam rubber of the same size, and a half-dozen small      sheet metal screws.    </p>    <p>      According to Mr. Smyers, assembling the lamp required only      the most basic metalworking or electrical skills, but did      call for the use of a soldering iron, an electric drill      with a bit assortment, tinsnips, needle-nosed pliers, a      hammer, a pin punch, and a sewing machine.    </p>        <p>      Emerson first scribed and cut out one 16" and one      3-1/4"-diameter disk, a 2-1/4" X 27" strip, and a 4" X 10"      rectangle from the copper sheet. Then, using some leftover      scraps, he made three 5/16" X 9/16" tabs, which he bent      into Z-shapes.    </p>    <p>      Next, he bored a small hole at the center of the larger      disk and removed a "pie slice" section - 2-1/2" wide      at its base - from it. After bending the penny-metal      pie into a shallow cone, adding (optional) decorative ribs      or flutes at 1-1/4" intervals, and holding it to that shape      by soldering the three Z-tabs at equal points along the      seam (then filling that joint as well), the researcher      drilled a 3/8" opening through the cone's apex . . . and a      1/4" hole about 3 inches from that peak. Then he soldered      three 3/4" rings (which he bent from short pieces of      welding rod) at equal points around the lid's lower surface      to support the 8"-diameter sock collar.    </p>    <p>      The bulb's jacket is similar in construction to a tin can.      To make it, Emerson - using his pin punch -      first drove a patterned series of holes through the 4" X      10" copper sheet, to within 3/4 inch of each end. Then he      bent a 1/8" lip into one side, formed the piece around a      section of pipe to create a 3 "-diameter tube, and      completed the Z-seam by trimming and bending the mating      edge and soldering the seam. The can's lid is the 3-1/4"      disk with a 1-1/4" hole cut through its center, and both      its inner and outer edges nipped every 1/4 inch or so to      allow the outside to contour to the cylinder for a clean      solder joint, and the inside to grip the porcelain lamp      socket.    </p>    <p>      Assembling the sock section was simply a matter of bending      the long copper strip and the sheet-metal panel into 8      "-diameter rings . . . Z-ing and soldering their seams . .      . and stitching the muslin to form a tube that's 8" across      and about 6 feet long. The welding rods - bent into      8"-diameter rings, tacked together, and stitched into the      muslin sock at 2-foot increments - hold the cloth to      shape, and the 1/2" rings (sewn to the seam on the inside      and about a foot apart) serve as guides for the speaker      wire that powers the fan.    </p>    <p>      The motor, by the way, is held within the lower housing by      the same sheet metal screws that pin the sock to the ring,      and foam padding was used between the fan frame and the tin      collar to subdue noise and vibration. (In a similar manner,      Emerson screwed the upper part of the sock to the copper      collar . . . then bored holes in <em>that</em> ring to      accept a trio of 4" chain sections.)    </p>    <p>      Once the lamp and fan wires were joined within the lamp      socket, that fixture fastened - with the aid of      washers - into the conical shade, the free fan lead      threaded through that lid and the guide rings, and its      terminals wire-nutted to those of the motor . . . the lamp      was ready to hang. But, as Emerson points out, its      appearance can be enhanced by adding designs - using      a quality textile-printing ink - to the outside of      the muslin before the sock is assembled . . . and that hour      or so of extra effort can make a pleasant world of      difference!    </p>
