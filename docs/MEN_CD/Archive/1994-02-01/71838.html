            		<p>				NATURAL KITCHEN    </p>    <p>      <strong>It's high time we had some tasty salad options      during the winter months.</strong>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">		By Anne Vassal</h5>		        <p>      It's depressing. That's the only way to describe preparing      salads in the dead of winter. Handling limp lettuce,      crunchless carrots, and soggy celery just adds to the      overbearing bleakness that hits many of us midwinter.      Desperately we long for a little crunch, flavor-anything-in      our greens. For those of us who aren't growing our own      winter gardens in solar greenhouses, crisp, flavorful      veggies can be pretty hard to find north of the Mason Dixon      line. Even our pet rabbit turns up her nose at the sight of      February's pathetic produce. It's no wonder people attempt      to liven their salads by smothering them with heaps of oily      or creamy dressings.    </p>    <p>      Some of you may consider rebelling by beginning a salad      fast until June, when you can start harvesting the veggies      from your outdoor garden again. Be warned, rebelling isn't      such a hot idea. Winter is typically the meat-and-potato      season, when we crave stick-to-your-ribs type foods      (logical since our bodies need extra fuel to equip us for      winter weather). But because cooking breaks down the fiber      in our food, meat and potatoes are sorely lacking in fiber      and other nutrients that are found only in fresh produce.      Of all the times to skimp on nutrition, the cold and flu      season may be the worst of all.</p><p>			Fiber has another important quality during the winter    months. It helps us control the extra weight that inevitably    sneaks up on so many of us. Because raw produce has more    bulls than cooked produce, you don't have to eat as much of    it to feel full. As it is digested, the fiber takes with it    waste calories that otherwise hang around waiting to    metabolize as fat. Therefore salad skimping is one sacrifice    you want to avoid. Because flying off to tropical veggie-rich    climates in February may not be feasible financially, we need    to start getting creative with seasonal fruits and    vegetables.    </p>		<h3>Couscous Salad with Harissa Sauce	</h3>	    <p>     <em>*2 cups couscous (1 use whole wheat instead of white    couscous )</em><br /> <em>1 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth cup    frozen peas, defrosted</em><br /> <em>1 teaspoon ground cumin    teaspoon ground coriander teaspoon cinnamon</em><br /> <em>1    tablespoon lemon juice dash of salt and cayenne pepper</em><br />    <em>1 15-ounce can garbanzo beans, rinsed 3 green onions cup    chopped fresh herbs: cilantro, mint (use parsley if the other    two are unavailable)</em><br /><em>4 radishes, chopped    (optional)<br />    Spicy Hot Harissa Sauce</em><br /><em>1 large clove garlic</em><br />    <em>2 jalapeno peppers, stems and seeds removed (for a milder    sauce, try 1 jalapeno and 1/2 roasted poblano pepper with    skin removed)</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup olive oil cup lemon juice</em><br />    <em>1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind</em><br /> <em>1/4teaspoon    salt</em><br /> <em>1/8 teaspoon caraway seeds</em><br />		</p>    <p>      Bring broth to a boil. Put couscous in large bowl or pan      with a lid. Pour broth over couscous, cover, and let sit      for 15 minutes. Fluff with fork and add peas and spices.      Stir in rest of salad ingredients.    </p>        <p>      <strong>WINTER SLAW: For a change of pace this winter, turn      cabbage and apples into crispy coleslaw.</strong>    </p>    <p>      In blender, mix dressing well, and store in separate      container. Before serving, shake dressing and then drizzle      over couscous.    </p>    <p>      *Couscous is an African pasta dish made from wheat. It can      be found with Mediterranean foods in supermarkets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Orange Watercress Salad</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 bunch watercress, washed and trimmed, or fresh      spinach, chopped</em><br /> <em>2 navel oranges</em><br /> <em>1 daikon      radish (about 3/4 cup cut into matchstick-size pieces)</em><br />      <em>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dressing</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 tablespoon sesame or canola oil</em><br /> <em>1 teaspoon      grated orange rind cup fresh orange juice</em><br /> <em>*1      tablespoon crystallized ginger, cut up with scissors into      small pieces a dash of cayenne pepper</em><br />    </p>    <p>      Toast sesame seeds briefly in dry skillet, and shake pan a      few times until seeds are lightly browned. Combine      watercress, oranges, and radish. In blender, mix dressing      well and pour over salad. Toss, and top with sesame seeds.      Eat within an hour or greens will become soggy. (Dressing      can be made ahead of time if necessary.)    </p>    <p>      *Found in oriental grocery stores, in the Chinese cooking      section of supermarkets, or in natural food markets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wild Rice Salad</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 1/2 <em>cups basmati brown rice (or other long grain      rice)</em><br /> <em>1/2 cup wehani or wild rice</em><br /> <em>3/4 cup      red onion, finely chopped</em><br /> <em>2 tablespoons champagne      vinegar (or white wine vinegar)</em><br /> <em>1 tablespoon mild      oil</em><br /> <em>1/3 cup currants</em><br /> <em>1 small red pepper,      sliced into thin strips and then chopped</em><br /> <em>2 green      onions, diced</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup chopped walnuts      (optional)</em><br />    </p>    <p>     <strong>Dressing</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/3 cup orange juice, fresh or frozen</em><br /> <em>2      teaspoons grated orange peel</em><br /> <em>3 tablespoons apricot      jam (I use unsweetened jam)</em><br /> <em>a few dashes cayenne      pepper</em><br /> <em>salt and freshly ground pepper to      taste</em><br />    </p>    <p>      Bring four cups water (three cups if you're using wild      rice) to boil. Stir in basmati and wehani rice. Cover and      simmer for 40 to 45 minutes. If using wild rice, cook      separately according to directions. Refrigerate rice      overnight if possible. Heat champagne vinegar and oil in      microwave or stove. Pour hot liquid over red onions and      currants. Prepare rest of salad. Whisk dressing and pour      over salad. Stir in red onions and currants. Serve topped      with walnuts if desired.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garbanzo Bean Salad</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 19-ounce can garbanzo beans (chick peas), rinsed well      and drained</em><br /> <em>2 cups celery, chopped</em><br /> <em>1      small red onion, quartered and sliced thin</em><br /> <em>1/2 cup      parsley, chopped</em><br /> <em>2 teaspoons dried dill</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dressing</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 tablespoon olive oil (1 use extra virgin)</em><br /> <em>2      tablespoons balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar</em><br /> <em>1      teaspoon Dijon mustard</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup lemon juice</em><br />      <em>2 large cloves garlic, minced</em><br /> <em>1/4 teaspoon      cayenne pepper</em><br /> <em>salt and freshly ground pepper</em><br />    </p>    <p>      Pour salad ingredients into a large bowl and then mix.      Whisk together dressing ingredients, pour over bean salad,      and stir so that beans are coated. Salad will keep in      refrigerator for five to six days.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Apple Coleslaw</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>4 cups green cabbage, sliced very thin</em><br /> <em>1 red      apple, chopped into</em><br /> <em>1/2</em> <em>inch pieces</em><br />      <em>2 green onions, sliced</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dressing</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon cider vinegar</em><br /> <em>2</em>      <em>tablespoons apple cider</em><br /> <em>1/4 cup thick      yogurt</em><br /> <em>2 tablespoons light or soy mayonnaise</em><br />      <em>2 teaspoons honey</em><br /> <em>1/4 teaspoon curry      powder</em> <em>1/4 teaspoon salt</em><br /> <em>dash cayenne      pepper</em><br /> <em>1/2 cup cilantro or fresh parsley</em><br />    </p>    <p>      Pour cabbage, apple, and onions into bowl.
