        The New Mexico solar food dryer combines direct and indirect solar heating. Direct sunlight heats the racks of food in the upper part of the dryer, while the corrugated metal absorber plate at the bottom of the dryer promotes indirect heating by creating a convection current of hot air that travels upward through the racks of food.
