                    <hr />    <p>      <strong>WATER QUENCHES FIRE ANTS</strong> , according to      Florida State University insect ecologist. Dr. Walter      Tschinkel. Just choose a cool, sunny day when most of the      ants are close to the surface . . . break open the tops of      all of the colony's hard mounds . . . and pour about three      gallons of scalding water into each "hill". One or two      additional applications of the hot liquid may be necessary,      but any survivors will stay (where they can be re-treated)      rather than merely relocating and building up their      strength again, as they often do after chemical treatments.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHILE MILLIONS STARVE</strong> , the government      estimates that 20% of all food produced in the U.S. (an      amount which adds up to about 137 million tons and is worth      some $31 billion) is wasted. Our nation's production and      distribution systems, for example, lose-in one year      alone-enough food to keep 49 million people alive . . . and      another 60 million tons of edibles (worth $5 billion) are      simply left in fields and orchards for lack of commercial      markets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TINY CREATURES FROM FRESHWATER LAGOONS</strong> :      The Center for Disease Control reports 123 deaths,      worldwide, caused by Naegleria fowleri . . . a strain of      freshwater amoeba which devours human brain cells (only      three people have, so far, recovered from such attacks).      Although-in the past 12 years-there've been fewer than 35      victims in the United States, the CDC cautions against      extended underwater swimming.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A $10 LIGHT BULB</strong> , made by General      Electric, will be on the market in early 1981. The lamp      will fit into existing sockets . . . should last four times      longer than-and use about one-third the energy of-normal      bulbs . . . and is expected to save the consumer about $20      over its projected life. Illumination in the new bulb is      produced by an arc of electricity in a quarts-tube-enclosed      metal halide vapor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ELECTRIFIED BEEF</strong> will soon be on the      market, as the packing industry rapidly adopts a new      process that tenderises meat with a series of 600-volt      shocks . . . administered to a carcass for about one minute      before it's hung up to age. The treated meat is said to      produce steaks that are 50% more tender than are untreated      cuts, which will upgrade more beef to the "USDA Choice"      class.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ORGANIC LAWN MOWERS :</strong> Shortly after his      rent-a-goat ad appeared in a San Diego newspaper, Harold      Norris was swamped with calls for the service . . . which      many homeowners saw as a means of preventing the brush      fires that often sweep southern California's overgrown      canyon residential areas. Harold charges a $7.50 rental      rate for one sure-footed weed-eater per week, or $11 for      two.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SINKING FEELING :</strong> Since 1915,      approximately 35 trillion gallons of irrigation water have      been pumped from beneath the surface of the broad valley      between Arizona's Picacho and Santa Rosa mountains. As a      result, a 120-square-mile area between Phoenix and Tucson      has dropped -from 7 to 121 feet below its former level-and      created at least 800 earth fissures (some chasms are as      much as 25 feet wide, and one is a full nine miles long).    </p>    <p>      <strong>EAT IT BUT DON'T DIGEST IT</strong> is the theory      behind a whole new line of food preservatives, sweeteners,      and colorings that's being developed by California's      Dynapol Company. This nonabsorption technology leashes      small molecules-such as those in food additives-to much      larger molecules that can't pass through the intestinal      walls to be metabolised by the body!    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN ANTI-RADAR DEVICE</strong> -which enabled      Israeli pilots to carry out their secret Entebbe rescue      mission-emits rays that alter the magnetic fields and      centers of gravity of instrument dials, and confuse the      aiming devices on many weapons as well. Though the details      of the "ray" are still among Israel's best-kept military      secrets, its inventor, Sydney Hurwich of Toronto, once      staged a demonstration-reminiscent of the reports often      given by flying saucer slighters-that stopped watches and      jammed the guns of Canadian police.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STOP SMOKING WITH SPINACH :</strong> Preliminary      studies indicate that simple sodium bicarbonate may enable      smokers to drastically cut down their use of (or abstain      from) cigarettes. It seems that people with high acid      levels in their urine are more likely to crave nicotine      than are men or women with low levels. Though researchers      used four grams of bicarbonate to aid smoker withdrawal in      their tests, they suggest that beet and spinach green-sand      other alkalizing foods-may have "much more profound      effects".    </p>    <p>      <strong>GUESS I'LL GO EAT WORMS :</strong> A worm farmer,      who points out that his wrigglers are 70% protein, offers      this recipe for their preparation: "Boil them for five      minutes, then change the water and reboil four or five      times until the meat is 'purified'. Put the worms on a      cookie sheet and bake in a 380Â°F oven for about is      minutes. They come out crisp and tasty, like french fries      or bits of bacon."    </p>    <p>      <strong>SURVIVAL Or THE FURRIEST :</strong> Mice in a      London meat market have developed long fur coats as      protection against the chill inside cold-storage units ....      While serfs in the middle ages paid 20% of their earnings      to their masters, the average worker today hands over 40%      of his or her pay to <strong>MILORD, UNCLE SAM .... GOLD      FRANKLINS</strong> , the new troyounce, half-ounce, and      quarter-ounce gold pieces from the Franklin Mint      (sculptured by Gilroy Roberts, designer of the U.S. Kennedy      half dollar) are an American alternative to South Africa's      Krugerrands . . . . NEW YORK'S SUPER RATS , oversized      rodents that are impervious to most kinds of poisons, are      being snared by the city in mesh cages baited with peanut      butter sandwiches.    </p>
