                <p>      <strong><em>It'll take a little talent and patience, but      you can save money and fill your outdoor clothing and      equipment needs with . . .</em></strong>    </p>        <hr />                    <p>      Bein' in the great outdoors is always much more enjoyable      when you have the proper clothing and equipment ... but      quality goods bring premium prices at the local sporting      emporium or department store and such expenses aren't      always easy to squeeze into most people's already tight      budgets. Furthermore-while MOTHER thinks it's great that      some people can whip up a hooded parka or sleeping bag from      scratch-not everyone has that kind of sewing ability.    </p>    <p>      The answer to the problem of obtaining moderately priced,      quality outdoor gear may be the "sew-it-yourself kit",      which is made up of premeasured and precut materials      (including all the thread and fasteners you'll need to put      the project together), and contains step-by-step stitchery      instructions. Besides saving you between 30% and 50%      compared to similar ready-made's, such custom construction      packages offer the satisfaction of doingmostof-it-yourself      . . . allow you to add personal touches like fur trims,      appliques, yokes, embroidery, and contrasting colors ...      and even help you develop the kind of sewing skills you'll      need to start from scratch in the future!    </p>    <h3>      TIME AND SPACE    </h3>    <p>      But, while "prefab" kits will definitely save you money      and-in the end-probably provide products that are better      constructed than their factory-made counterparts ... they      can be time-consuming projects to assemble. Also, though      there are a number of "sew-easy" items available, some of      the more advanced kits require a great deal of stitchery      skill.    </p>    <p>      Then, too, unless you're making small items (such as      bicycle or tote bags, booties, or mittens), you'll need      plenty of room to work . . . because considerable      quantities of material are involved in the construction of      a tent, comforter, sleeping bag, or long coat. And, despite      the fact that some companies enclose their pre-measured      down in convenient plastic pouches, you'll likely still      have a small blizzard on your hands when you actually pack      your garment with insulation.    </p>    <p>      One time-consuming job you'll encounter when working with a      great many kits is "searing the seams". You see, many      sew-it-yourself items are made from rip-stop nylon or nylon      taffeta, and it's absolutely imperative to apply heat to      the cut edges of such materials to prevent their      unraveling. This means that-before seaming'em together-the      pieces of fabric have to be fused all around with a candle      flame (and then re-seared if you're working, for example,      on a curved seam that has to be clipped in order for it to      lie flat). This sealing process must be done slowly and      carefully in order not to burn your product or yourself.    </p>    <h3>      AN IN-HOUSE TEST    </h3>    <p>      We decided to find out just how much work and talent it      takes to assemble some of these attractive items from      moneysaving kits. Using four different packages from      Frostline (one of the leading manufacturers of      sew-it-yourself outdoor clothing and equipment), a quartet      of MOTHER's helpers-folks with varying degrees of sewing      skill-constructed the items pictured here: a small (16-1/2"      X 9-1/2") duffel bag . . . a "High Country" down vest ... a      "Decorator" down-filled, twin-size comforter ... and a      fashionable "Down Around" maxi coat.    </p>    <p>      Babs, who made the duffel bag, knows the rudiments of      sewing, but doesn't claim to be an expert by a long shot.      Though the kit took three "spare time" evenings to put      together, she found the bag quite easy to make ... and was      pleased with the results!    </p>    <p>      Johnnie, on the other hand, is an experienced dressmaker.      Yet she had to spend a number of evening hours-plus the      good part of one weekend-working on her fairly complicated      down vest with its "hand-warmer" pockets. The cozy, solidly      constructed end product, however, seems to confirm that it      was time well spent.    </p>    <p>      Pat assembled the comforter in the photo-using her 1911,      hand-operated Puff sewing machine-in approximately eight      hours. Since the bedcover's fabric (Trinyl) didn't have to      be seared (though Pat did turn in all the edges twice to      prevent any chance of ravels) and involved straight seams,      her "just basic" sewing knowledge was quite adequate ...      although the task of getting the down into the comforter's      "tubes" took a fair bit of patience. (Pat claims to have      absolute proof that the kit's down is "the real thing",      though: When she brought the package home, her bird dog      immediately "pointed" it!)    </p>    <p>      Our fourth stitchery "guinea pig", Celeste, had made a      Frost-line down jacket some four years before, and-since      she sews most of her own clothes-didn't hesitate to take on      the myriad complications of making a down-filled maxi coat.      Even so, she was a little taken aback by the sheer quantity      of material and complexity of parts she had to deal with ..      . the more than two hours it took just to sear the taffeta      material ... and the patience required to get the proper      amount of down inserted and distributed evenly before      machine-quilting the garment.    </p>    <p>      Though she found the instructions "pretty good", Celeste      thinks some important little details (that wouldn't be      "common knowledge" to any but a very experienced seamster      or seamstress) were left out. However, after almost 30      hours of work, she had a gorgeous down coat for less than      half the price she'd have paid in a store.    </p>    <h3>      THE PERFECT WINTER PROJECT    </h3>    <p>      Our conclusions? There's no doubt that -if you pick a      project to match your skills -the do-it-at-home sewing kits      can give you a sturdy, stylish piece of clothing or outdoor      equipment at about half the price of its ready-made      equivalent. Of course, the stitchery will occupy a number      of hours of your "spare" time. But there's a big stretch of      long winter nights ahead . . . and these practical and      personalized outfits, packs, and camping-gear pieces could      be the perfect way to fill up those evenings with some      projects that will make you "right proud" of yourself!    </p>    <hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: More information on the above kits can be      had by writing Frostline, Dept.
