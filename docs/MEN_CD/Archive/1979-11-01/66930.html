                <p>      <strong><em>Come next year's holiday season, why not put      your kitchen skills to work?</em></strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by ELLEN SUE SPIVACK    </h5>    <p>      Now that the yuletide is drawin' nigh, some mighty      mouthwatering smells will be waftin' from kitchens all over      the land. Strangely enough, however, most of the good cooks      responsible for those aromas are missin' out on a chance to      turn some of their home-grown cooking talent into pockets      full of spare change. (And extra cash can come in pretty      handy to fill empty spaces under the Christmas tree or to      stuff a few stockings with special gifts.)    </p>    <p>      It seems almost every chef has several specific dishes at      which he or she excels. And no matter what <em>your</em>      specialty might be-fine fruitcakes, bread, tasty      casseroles, a pungent pear relish, or some ethnic dish from      out of your family's past-I'd be willing to bet that      someone else would pay good money to taste your culinary      wares or learn your secrets.    </p>    <h3>      SHARE AND SUCCEED    </h3>    <p>      One of the best ways to market your kitchen skills is to      teach a cooking class or two. You can often get such jobs      through your local adult education center (where you'd      probably have use of a school's home economics facilities)      . . . or you could simply turn your <em>own</em> kitchen      into a classroom. Then too, women's clubs and church groups      are often glad of a chance to provide their members with a      demonstration of how to prepare some delicious holiday      dishes and treats.<br />      If you decide to teach, spread the news by word-of-mouth      (for example, a club "show" could be a good time to sign up      class members for an expanded, out-of-your-home course).      Advertise in the local classifieds as well, and put up      notices on public bulletin boards. You can charge about      $3.00 or $4.00 per person per class (with perhaps $1.00      extra per session to cover food expenses) . . .      or-better yet-simply set a flat rate of $25 to      $30 for a five- or six-lesson course.    </p>    <p>      Now . . . pull out all those lip-smacking recipes that      you've tested and loved over the years. Do you have an      impressive number of 'em? If so, why not put together your      own cookbook? Duplicating services aren't all that      expensive if you shop around . . . and your      students-who, after all, have had a chance to      <em>taste</em> the scrumptious dishes-are likely to      snap up such a publication for a price that'll bring you a      tidy profit. In addition, try to display your cookbook at      local bookstores, and/or advertise and sell it through the      mail. If your recipes have a wide appeal or a specific      theme, you might even send them off to a publisher who      specializes in kitchen anthologies.    </p>    <h3>      GO PUBLIC!    </h3>    <p>      Another way to earn some kitchen-created cash is to market      your specialties at public events. People get a little      tired of hot dogs, soft drinks, and manufactured sweets ...      so homemade cookies, cakes, pies, quiches, salads,      preserves, etc. can be "hot" items at these affairs. (To      determine your selling price, a general rule of thumb is to      double your ingredient costs and add a little extra to      absorb the usual booth fee.)    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if you don't like dealing directly with      the public, you might offer some of your special dishes to      a local caterer. Or-if you have the time-even      do some catering <em>yourself</em> . Many folks in your      community would probably welcome a healthful, wholesome      "banquet" brought to their homes or clubs from time to      time. And along that same line, some of the health food      stores and restaurants in the area might jump at the chance      to have fine breads and other homebaked goodies delivered      regularly to their doors.    </p>    <p>      The point is ... it could be a mistake to keep your      culinary abilities hidden at home, when the holidays are a      perfect time to make kitchen skills pay!    </p>
