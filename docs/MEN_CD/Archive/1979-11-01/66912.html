                <p>      <strong>This is the second of two excerpts. The first      installment, which appeared in MOTHER NO. 59, covered the      use of the crosscut saw.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Reprinted from Crosscut Saw Manual by Warren Miller      (available for $1.50 from the Superintendent of Documents,      U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.      20402).</em>    </p>    <hr />    <p>      Opinions vary among saw filers as to the order of steps      followed in filing a crosscut. Guidelines offered by saw      companies differ significantly. After examining the reasons      for the different orders, I've concluded the following      sequence is preferable.    </p>    <p>      <em>Cleaning:</em> removing rust or pitch.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hammering:</em> straightening a saw if it has bumps,      kinks, or twists in it.    </p>    <p>      <em>Jointing:</em> the means by which the tips or all the      cutter teeth are made to conform to the circle of the saw.    </p>    <p>      <em>Raker fitting:</em> includes shaping the raker gullet      and swaging and sharpening the raker.    </p>    <p>      <em>Pointing up cutter teeth:</em> filing the teeth sharp.    </p>    <p>      <em>Setting:</em> bending the tips of the cutter teeth away      from the plane of the saw, causing the kerf to be wider      than the blade.<br />      These are the tools necessary for each operation.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hammering:</em> two steel straightedges about 10 to 14      inches long, a 3- to 4-pound cross-pein saw hammer (some      manufacturers call them cross-face hammers), a fairly flat      anvil.<br />      Jointing: jointer (short or long), 7- or 8-inch special      crosscut file (mill bastard blunt file), saw vise.    </p>    <p>      <em>Raker fitting:</em> 7- or 8-inch slim taper      (triangular) file, pin gage, raker gage, hammer for swaging      (8- to 16-ounce tinner's riveting hammer), 6-inch slim      taper file with "safe" corners (corners ground smooth),      6-inch mill bastard file, saw vise.    </p>    <p>      <em>Pointing up cutter teeth:</em> 7- or 8-inch special      crosscut file (mill bastard blunt file) for lance tooth      saws, 6- or 8-inch Great American crosscut file for      champion tooth saws, saw vise.    </p>    <p>      <em>Setting:</em> 8-ounce set hammer (or tinner's riveting      hammer), setting stake or set tool or anvil, spider, saw      vise.    </p>        <h3>      CLEANING THE SAW    </h3>    <p>      Often a filer must clean a rusty or pitchy saw. One good      method is to lay the tool on a flat surface and clean with      an axe stone or a pumice grill stone. Liberally douse the      blade with kerosene or diesel oil to cut pitch and keep the      stone from plugging up with debris. Small kinks show up as      bright areas for high spots and dark places for      indentations. Use only enough pressure on the cutter teeth      to clean them... if metal is taken off the tips, both set      and tooth length will be affected.<br />    </p>    <h3>      HAMMERING OR STRAIGHTENING    </h3>    <p>      Few saws are completely straight. Although slight kinks or      bumps won't cause much trouble, a straight saw requires      minimum set and is less likely to buckle during the push      stroke when one person is sawing. And it will cut      straighter.    </p>    <p>      The saw to be straightened is hung vertically from one of      the handle holes.    </p>    <p>      Hold the straightedges lightly-one on each side of      the saw-so they are directly opposite each other. By      moving the devices back and forth as well as along the saw,      any kinks or bumps can be found. If you move the      straightedges with a slight twisting motion, quite small      kinks can be found by the difference in resistance. A      straightedge contacting the convex side of a kink will      twist easier than one on the concave surface.    </p>    <p>      When a kink is located, determine its shape and axis by      moving the straightedges over its surface. Mark its shape      with chalk or grease pencil (a wetted finger works well      too), put the concave side down flat on the anvil,      and-with the appropriate face of your cross-pein      hammer-strike the saw several times over the kink.      (The appropriate face is the one that is fairly parallel to      the kink axis.) Check with straightedges and determine      further action. Take care to strike the saw with the face      of the hammer and not the edge. If done properly, the      hammer should leave no visible mark. A slightly      round-faced, 3-pound hammer can be used, but results aren't      as good as with the cross-pein type.    </p>    <p>      If it should be impossible to acquire a straightedge      specifically for saw work, acceptable substitutes exist.      The characteristics of a desirable straightedge are that it      be light, stiff, and reasonably straight. A thickness from      0.050 to 0.100 inch is acceptable with the thinner      dimension being desirable. Possible substitutes might be      draftsman's or machinist's straightedges, or the rule from      a combination square.    </p>    <h3>      JOINTING THE SAW    </h3>    <p>      The number and variety of jointers are considerable, but      the principle is the same for all. They hold a file in such      a way that it can be run over the saw teeth to insure that      they all lie on the circle of the blade. There are short      and long jointers. The short jointer, generally part of a      combination saw tool, is by far the more common.    </p>    <p>      To use the short jointer, insert the file so it rests      <em>flat</em> on the supports (lugs) and adjust the screw      so the rasp bends to conform to the circle of the saw. Make      sure the surface of the file is square with the guide rails      on the body of the jointer... the tool may be warped or      improperly seated on the supports. Insert the file so it      runs in the normal filing direction (if used backwards, its      life will be severely shortened). Because a new rasp often      will cut faster than desired, a worn-out 7- or 8-inch      special crosscut file with the tang broken off works well.    </p>    <p>      Place the jointer on one end of the saw. Holding the tool      so the file rests on the cutter teeth, run the jointer the      length of the blade, using uniform downward pressure. This      is crucial if the circle of the saw is to be maintained. It      is also important to hold the guide rails on the body of      the jointer in contact with the side of the saw at all      times to assure that the file is square to the blade.    </p>    <p>      After the jointer has been run the length of the saw, look      at the teeth. If each tip has a shiny spot where the file      has just touched it, jointing is complete. If some teeth      are so short they weren't touched, repeat the process until      all show the mark of the file. If a tooth has been chipped      or broken so it is much shorter than the rest, don't worry      about it. No sense jointing the life out of a saw to make      it perfect.    </p>    <h3>      PAKER FITTING    </h3>    <p>      For a saw to operate efficiently the raker teeth must      remove all the fiber severed by the cutter teeth, but no      more.    </p>    <p>      Because the cutting teeth exert pressure on the wood as      they cut, a certain thickness of wood is compressed and      springs back after the teeth pass over. As a result, fibers      are not severed quite as deeply as the teeth penetrate.      Consequently, the rakers following the cutters must be      shorter by the amount the wood springs back, so no      unsevered wood is removed.    </p>    <p>      Optimum depth is obtained by experiment, but figures vary      from 0.008 inch for hard or dry wood to 0.030 inch for      soft, springy wood... 0.012 inch is a good average figure      to begin with.    </p>    <p>      The depth of the rakers below the cutter teeth is      determined by using a tool called a raker gage or raker      depth gage... generally part of a combination saw filing      tool of which numerous varieties were manufactured. The      essential feature of all of them is a hardened steel filing      plate with a slot cut in it a little wider than the      thickness of a saw and a little longer than the distance      between the two tips on a raker. This is held on a frame in      such a way that when the gage is placed over the raker, the      top of the filing plate is the same level as the desired      raker depth. The raker tips are cut to the level of the      plate with a file. The height of the filing plate is      adjustable.    </p>    <p>      One way of checking the setting of a raker gage is to file      a raker, using the tool... then by placing a straightedge      between the two cutter teeth on each side of the filed      raker, you can measure the relative height with a feeler      gage placed between the raker and straightedge.    </p>    <p>      There are two basic ways a raker can be shaped before it is      filed to its proper depth: straight or swaged. The straight      raker is by far the easier to file, but it results in a      relatively "slow" running saw. The swaged raker is      considerably more difficult to shape but results in a      superior tool. The reason for the difference is apparent      when one remembers that the raker acts like a chisel to      remove the shaving. Much less energy is required to remove      wood from a board if a chisel is held at a low angle to a      board than if it is held vertically. Swaging results in a      raker tip that is similar to a chisel held at a low angle      to the wood.    </p>        <h3>      FITTING STRAIGHT RAKERS    </h3>    <p>      With a 7- or 8-inch slim taper file, dress (smooth) the      outside face of the rakers from the raker tip to the bottom      of the sawdust gullet. Make sure the file is held square      with the saw. This will provide clean, sound metal for the      cutting edge of the raker, cause less friction between the      outside face and the shaving, and aid shaving removal.    </p>    <p>      Next, file the raker to the proper depth. Place the      properly adjusted raker gage on the saw so the raker fits      in the slot in the filing plate. Hold the gage so it rests      firmly against the tops of the cutter teeth as well as the      side of the saw. Run a file across the raker tips until      they are even with the top of the filing plate. Once the      raker tip has been filed, the raker must be sharpened. With      a 7- or 8-inch slim taper file, shape the raker gullet to      the approximate shape shown in the accompanying      illustration, rounding the gullet out to the tip until the      flat spot on top <em>almost</em> disappears. If the tip is      overfiled, it changes the raker depth. If not filed enough,      the flat spot acts like a "sled runner" and does not permit      the edge to work properly.    </p>    <h3>      FITTING SWAGED RAKERS    </h3>    <p>      Swaging is forming the leading edge of the raker into a      curve so it more efficiently picks up the shaving. It is      done by striking a prepared raker tip on the inside face      with a hammer to bend the tip outward in a smooth curve. A      swaging hammer should have a face small enough to permit      you to strike the raker tip with the center of the face.      The best tool for swaging appears to be a tinner's riveting      hammer.    </p>    <p>      To prepare the raker, file it approximately to the shape      shown in the drawing, using the slim taper file. The exact      shape depends on whether the raker is straight or has been      swaged before. The objective is to shape the tip so it can      be bent without breaking, but retain enough thickness to      prevent bending during use. For starters, the cutting angle      should be between 30 and 40 degrees.    </p>    <p>      The raker is now ready to be "swaged to the pin". This      means bending the raker by striking the inside face of the      raker tip with a hammer until the tip <em>just</em> clears      a preset screw (called a pin) on a combination saw tool.    </p>    <p>      The pin is adjusted so the swaged raker is 0.002 to 0.003      inch higher than the finished raker depth. This is done by      first filing a raker to depth, using the raker gage. Next,      place the pin gage over the raker and adjust the pin      (screw) depth so a 0.002- or 0.003-inch feeler gage will      just pass between the raker tip and the pin. Check      clearance again after tightening locknut.    </p>    <p>      To swage a raker, strike the raker tip a square blow, and      check the height with the pin gage. If it is still too      high, continue alternately swaging and checking until the      raker tooth just clears the pin. Keep an eye on the shape      of the bend... the outside face of the raker should bend in      a smooth arc. A kinked raker tip will be difficult to swage      next time the saw is filed, and it will quite possibly      break. If the tip begins to kink, the hammer probably is      being used too high on the tip. If it won't bend, the tip      may be too thick or the hammer is being used too low on the      tip. Often in the case of a new saw or a used saw with      straight rakers, it will be necessary to partially swage      the tip, then thin the tip some more with the file and      continue swaging.    </p>    <p>      There is no pat answer to the question:    </p>    <p>      "At what angle is the raker struck?" This will vary with      the shape of the raker tip and must be learned from      experience. Keep an eye on the desired swage shape...      knowing where to strike the tip will come with experience.    </p>    <p>      Some saws are so hard and consequently brittle that there      is a possibility of breaking raker tips when swaging. If a      saw is so hard that a fairly new file keeps slipping while      the filer is shaping the raker gullets, or if a raker      actually breaks when being swaged, the rakers should be      tempered.    </p>    <p>      To temper the raker, polish one side of each raker until it      is shiny. Place the saw in a vise. Heat the top      three-fourths of the tooth uniformly, using a propane      torch. As it gets hotter, the color will go from light      straw, to brown, to deep purple, to dark blue, to light      blue, to a light yellow color. There are differing opinions      on how far to temper the rakers (what color to heat to). A      compromise seems to be between light blue and the second      yellow. A suggestion would be to first temper to light      blue, then-if trouble is still      experienced-temper again to the second light yellow.      Don't heat into the body of the saw: It may cause the saw      to warp. Be very careful about playing the torch flame on      the raker tips... they heat very fast, making it extremely      easy to overheat them. This causes a soft raker that will      bend in hard wood and will not hold an edge.    </p>    <p>      Once the rakers are "swaged to the pin," the tips are      dressed on the outside face. To dress the swaged tip a      6-inch slim taper file with "safe" corners is run lightly      across the under edge of the swage to square it up and      establish the rake angle. It is most important not to nick      the raker with the edge of a file. A nick can cause the tip      to break off during swaging or in use. This is the reason      for the ground "safe" corners on the dressing file. After      dressing the outside face and rake angle, joint exactly as      with the straightstyle raker. As with straight rakers, a      trial depth of 0.012 inch for average conditions is good.    </p>    <p>      The last step is to dress the sides of the rakers. The      swaging process often widens the raker at the tip. This can      be corrected by holding a 6-inch mill bastard file flat      against the raker and saw and making one or two light      vertical strokes.    </p>    <h3>      REPAIRING BENT RAKERS AND CUTTER TEETH    </h3>    <p>      To check for bent rakers make up a spider (set gage) for      zero clearance on an unbent raker. A bent raker can easily      be found by using the spider in the same manner as for      checking cutter tooth set (see "Setting").    </p>    <p>      To straighten a bent raker, the concave side of the raker      is placed on an anvil and hammered until tooth is straight.      Badly bent cutter teeth could be straightened the same way.    </p>        <h3>      BROKEN RAKER TIP    </h3>    <p>      A broken raker tip allows the other tip on the raker to      bite too deeply on the cutting stroke, causing the saw to      catch just as it does with a long raker. File the unbroken      tip shorter, say 0.005 inch for starters. If it still      catches, file it even shorter.    </p>    <h3>      POINTING UP CUTTER TEETH    </h3>    <p>      To point up the cutter teeth, tilt the vise away from you      at about a 45-degree angle. With the vise tilted, the flat      spot on each tooth caused by jointing should appear bright.      The main light source needs to be in front so you can see a      good reflection off the flat spot. A wide set of windows      (preferably facing north to avoid direct sunlight) works      well. If possible, avoid point sources of light such as      incandescent bulbs and direct sunlight.    </p>    <p>      For filing the teeth, a 7- or 8-inch special crosscut file      is used. The stroke should be more nearly up and down the      tooth than across. The main point to keep in mind when      filing a cutter tooth is to file just enough to      <em>almost</em> make the flat spot from the jointing      operation disappear. Overfiling upsets the relation between      the cutters and the rakers and also results in a weak      point. A slight rolling or rocking motion of the file      generates a slightly convex filed surface and results in a      more durable tooth. Because of the set, a tooth whose filed      surface is flat will develop a concave cutting edge and a      thin, weak point.    </p>    <p>      As the tooth is being filed, it is a good idea to      periodically remove the burr that forms on the back side      because it can obscure the true tooth shape. Remove the      burr with whetstone or a <em>light</em> stroke of the file      across the tooth back... <em>just enough to remove the      burr</em> . The back side of the tooth must not be filed      because it may cause the saw to bind. The burr can also be      removed with a piece of hardwood.    </p>    <p>      After all the teeth are filed, run over them with a fine      stone held flat against the saw to remove any residual      burrs, especially at the tip of the tooth. A burr under the      spider would cause an error in the tooth set.    </p>    <h3>      SETTING    </h3>    <p>      To set a saw is to bend the tip of each cutter tooth away      from the plane of the saw a slight amount. Just as      alternate teeth are sharpened opposite each other, they are      set opposite to each other. Setting helps prevent binding      by resulting in a kerf that is slightly wider than the saw.      The amount of set required depends on the type of saw used      and the type of wood being cut. A saw should be set only as      much as required to keep it from binding. More set than      necessary results in more work to make a wider kerf, and a      saw that flops... with the possibility of a curving cut.      The set required can vary from almost nothing for a      crescent-taper-ground saw in dry hardwood to 0.030 inch for      the same saw in soft, punky wood. A set of 0.010 inch is a      good figure to start with. Flat-ground saws require more      set.    </p>    <p>      There are several ways of hammer setting a saw, only one of      which is recommended because of its speed and accuracy. The      necessary tools are an 8-ounce set hammer, a set anvil, and      a spider (set gage).    </p>    <p>      There doesn't appear to be a current manufacturer for a      hammer specifically designed for setting. A setting hammer      should have a fairly small face. A large face such as most      ball-pein hammers have is difficult to use for setting      without hitting adjacent teeth. The best substitute for a      setting hammer appears to be a tinner's riveting hammer      that weighs about 8 ounces.    </p>    <p>      There is no known current manufacturer for hand-held      anvils. Any piece of steel that can be held comfortably in      the hand and has a flat face and weighs about 2 pounds will      work. A piece of 1-1/2-inch-diameter shaft about 5 inches      long works admirably. It is not necessary to have a      bevel... simply setting the tooth over the edge of the face      will work fine.    </p>    <p>      The spider (set gage) is used to measure the tooth set. To      check the set for which the spider is adjusted, place it on      a flat surface so that the feet on the three short legs      contact the surface. With light pressure on the three short      legs, measure the clearance under the fourth foot (or      longer leg) with a feeler gage. A piece of plate glass or a      mirror will work for the flat surface, though it is wise to      check the spider several places on the surface so errors      caused by irregularities can be averaged out.    </p>    <p>      As indicated earlier, a set of about 0.010 inch would      probably be satisfactory for average work for a felling      saw. More set is required for a heavy bucking saw, say      0.015 inch.    </p>    <p>      To adjust the spider for less set, place it on a flat      carborundum stone and, while putting pressure on the short      crosspiece, grind the feet down until it measures right.      For more set, shorten either end of the long crosspiece. It      is important that the foot at the end of the long leg is      flat and parallel to the plane defined by the other three      feet. This assures a constant reading no matter where the      tip of the cutter tooth contacts the foot. This can be      checked by lightly grinding that foot while the two feet on      the short crosspiece are in contact with the stone and      observing the resulting pattern on the foot.    </p>    <p>      To set the saw, place an anvil on the point side of the      tooth and strike the tooth on the beveled side with a set      hammer. The bevel on the anvil should be about 1/4 inch      below the tip of the tooth and the direction and placement      of the hammer blow such that the tip of the cutter tooth is      bent over the bevel. Be sure to strike the tooth squarely.      If it is struck a glancing blow with the edge of the hammer      face, the point of impact will be badly marred. This      sometimes work-hardens the metal enough that a file won't      cut it. And it may make the tooth more susceptible to      breaking.    </p>    <p>      It is also important to keep the face of the anvil parallel      to the plane of the saw when setting. If it is held at an      angle, the tooth will be twisted when set. Check the set      with the spider. If the vertical legs rock, there is      insufficient set and the above procedure should be      repeated. If the horizontal legs rock, some of the set must      be taken out. This is done by moving the anvil nearly to      the top of the cutter tooth and striking a light blow.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes a tooth will have been bent from a point below      the filed part of the tooth. This can be determined by      checking with the spider up and down the tooth. If this is      the case, place the anvil on the tooth just below the bend      and straighten it by hammering the opposite side of the      tooth just above the anvil.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: MOTHER NO. 59 is available for S3.00      (plus $1.00 postage and handling per order) from THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted), P.O.
