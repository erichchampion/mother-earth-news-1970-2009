                        <p>      <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with      <strong>MOTHER's</strong> readers in a regular question and      answer column. If you'd like to get in on the action, send      your question or questions about self-sufficient living on      the land to Helen and Scott Nearing, <strong>THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted)</strong>, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C.      28739. And please don't expect personal replies to your      queries. The most important and most frequently asked      questions will be answered here -end here only-where we all      can read what the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In your writings, you've discussed eating rose hips for      vitamin C. Which method or methods do you recommend for      utilizing the tiny fruits to their best advantage? Also,      how many Rosa rugosa (or "wrinkled" rose) plants are      necessary to produce a sufficient quantity of fruit to      fulfill the vitamin C requirements of two adults? Are there      any particular rose varieties you prefer? Do you have any      tips on rose cultivation and control? I've heard that      "wild" roses can be a nuisance to grow because of their      tendency to spread over large areas</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>The rugosa species produces the largest hips and is      therefore the best "eating variety" rose. Half a dozen of      such plants would grow plenty of fruit for a family, though      we have over 20 bushes flourishing in our meadow. Once      established, the plants send out underground runners and      "daughter plants" which-if the soil and climate are      right-will produce a thicket.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We treat the wild roses just as we do raspberries,      planting them in hills six to seven feet apart in every      direction . . . limiting the number of canes they develop      to four or five per hill . . . and pruning out a third of      the old canes each year. This technique renews the plants      constantly.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Late in August or early in September, we go through      our rose hip "plantation" and snip off the hips or      rose-apples as they begin to color up and grow slightly      mellow. The process of preserving them is the same as that      described for making raspberry juice in Chapter 5, "Eating      for Health", of our book Living the Good Life (which is      available for $2.95 plus 95 cents shipping and handling      from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28739). We drink the bottled juice ... run the      softened hips through a blender . . . make soup of what      goes through a sieve . . . and dry on the stove-for      rose-hip tea-the solid material that remains.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Living the Good Life, you mention a "molasses drink" taken      for breakfast. Would you share your recipe with us?    </p>    <p>      We change our eating habits as we experiment with what      seems interesting or better. (However, we'll never turn to      the flesh of any creature that walks or wiggles.) As a      result of our constant experimentation, we no longer take      the "molasses drink" (which was just a tablespoon of the      syrup in a cup of hot water). Nowadays, we drink our own      dried herbs as a morning tea . . . adding a teaspoon of      honey per cup. Helen has a new anti-cookbook coming out in      the spring, which will have a full section on beverages.    </p>    <p>      I've been homesteading in West Virginia for over a year now      and want to raise blueberries for profit. However, before I      make the initial investment, I'd like to learn about the      "organic" methods of growing these plants . . . as well as      ways to control-without chemicals-insects and diseases that      prey on the berries. Any information you can give me would      be appreciated.    </p>    <p>      <strong>If you're to have success with hybrid blueberries,      you must live in a region that experiences at least 30      consecutive days with freezing temperatures each year. In      addition, you'll need acid soil . . . a well-drained plot .      . . and a moderately rich, sandy loam (though the delicious      berries can also be grown on peat land).</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Start with two-year-old plants and-for cross      fertilization-have at least three or four different      varieties. And-since each variety will bear ripe fruit over      a picking season of three or four weeks -a plantation      including early, medium, and late producers will provide a      total picking season of 10 or 12 weeks.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a useful      Farmers' Bulletin (available through your county extension      director) on blueberry culture. And Chapter 8 of our new      book, Continuing the Good Life (available for $9.95 from      any good bookstore or-for the same price plus 954 shipping      and handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28789), recounts our      experiences with this crop since moving to Maine.      Incidentally, we use no sprays or insecticides on our      bushes and reap bountiful harvests of big, beautiful      berries.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I disagree with your words of wisdom to the reader who      asked about having children in this age (MOTHER NO. 56).    </p>    <p>      My husband and I, too, considered the drawbacks of      pollution, nuclear war, overcrowding, and the high cost of      raising a child. However, it seemed to us that the decision      really came down to one consideration: Did we want all the      responsibility and the work that offspringwho, through our      loving guidance, might make the world better for being      here-would involve? We concluded that the possible rewards      out-weighed any labor, and now we have two beautiful      youngsters and are thinking about a third. (If we had it to      do over, we'd do the same.)    </p>    <p>      If earth-loving people don't raise their own followers,      what will happen to the world? Will there be a younger      generation that cares as we do?    </p>    <p>      <strong>In one sense, your contention is absolutely right:      Unless each generation leaves younger substitutes behind      it, the earth will soon be deprived of human beings. And if      we humans-through our succeeding generations-live up to our      possibilities as trustees and responsible directors of the      physical, social, and ethical well-being of the planet, it      will develop into a worthwhile living place for all life .      . . including humankind.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>But who can guarantee that your or our "beautiful      children" will not be corrupted or ensnared by wily      advertising and the seductive lifestyles that it portrays?      We know too many "earth-loving people" whose offspring have      not followed in the footsteps of their concerned parents.      We also know some "earth-loving parents" who've not been      able to stick together themselves, let alone been able to      care for their "beautiful children" properly. If you take      on childbearing and child-raising, you have an enormous      responsibility to society as to what your children become,      and as to how they contribute to or detract from the      wellbeing of the community.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>The population is doubling every 30 years, so the      quality of humanity is a real problem. We figured we were      performing a kind of social service not to have children in      this tormented world. And-without adding to the      population-we've tried to treat other people's children as      our own and to influence them for good.</strong>    </p>
