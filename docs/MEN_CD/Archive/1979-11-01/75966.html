                    <hr />    <p>      GO GOPHER Most vegetation uses the sun's rays to produce      carbohydrates, but the gopher plant (Euphorbia laythris)      produces hydrocarbons ... specifically, a petroleum type of      oil known as polyisoprene. An acre of the desert      weed-which reaches its four-foot harvesting height in      seven months-can produce 10 barrels of oil at a cost      (for cultivation and refining) of $20 a barrel . . . which      is now fully competitive with OPEC oil.    </p>    <p>      LIKEWISE: The latex that can be extracted from common      milkweed is chemically the same as crude oil, except that      the former contains no sulfur or other noxious compounds,      and-when the plant's hydrocarbons are      processed-they produce a higher-octane-rated      gasoline than do petroleum products!    </p>    <p>      THE POOR GET POORER: A DOE report notes that energy cost      increases "will rob poor households of what few pleasures      they have. While some wealthy individuals will continue to      drive large cars and take sauna baths, more and more      elderly poor will shiver in darkened dwellings."    </p>    <p>      MISDIRECTED ENERGY: When two Vermont power companies      proposed to buy 1% each of the embattled Sea brook nuclear      power plant stock for a total of $98 million,      environmentalists calculated that-for about the same      price-40,000 solar water heaters (which involve no      fuel costs, decommissionings, or waste storage) could be      professionally constructed and installed at a cost of      $2,500 each. The sun-powered heaters would produce just      slightly less power than the Seabrook purchase ... and      provide 3,000 to 4,000 installation jobs, at plumber's      wages.    </p>    <p>      DOES JIMMY KNOW that peanut hulls pressed into pellets are      being tested by the Army's Construction Engineering      Research Laboratory as an alternate fuel source? Dothan Oil      Mill in Alabama-which produces peanut      oil-already gets all of the steam needed to operate      its plant from ground-up goober shells.    </p>    <p>      HEARTY BACTERIA-collected from hot springs in      Yellowstone National Park by University of Georgia      researchers-could speed up the fermentation process      for making alcohol fuel. The little follows can also grow      in the absence of oxygen, live at temperatures as high as      172 OF, and ferment a number of sugars that yeast cannot      act upon.    </p>    <p>      SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, BROTHER! Alvin Weinberg, a physicist      who served for more than two decades as director of Oak      Ridge National Laboratory, said of the Three Mile Island      debacle: "It's our responsibility to prove this [nuclear]      technology can work. I don't think we can or should survive      if we can't fix it."    </p>    <p>      ALERT! ALERT! President Carter's Energy Mobilization Board      would have the authority to designate energy "priority"      projects ... a label which would exempt such undertakings      from local, state, and federal laws that safeguard public      health and the environment. The power of this board has      been described as "the energy equivalent of the Gulf of      Tonkin resolution".    </p>    <p>      POTENTIAL TNT: The National Safety Council warns that one      gallon of gasoline packs the explosive wallop of 14 sticks      of dynamite, and that there's just no safe way to store it      in an apartment, house, or car trunk.    </p>    <p>      BELIEVE IT OR NOT: The North Georgia Electric Membership      Corporation has offered interest-free loans-to its      electric heating customers-which would cover the      purchase and installation costs of airtight wood heaters,      with repayment to be made on monthly utility bills. For      further Information on this TVA-sponsored wood stove      program, call toll-free 800 / 251-9242 or, in Tennessee,      call 800 1362-9250.    </p>    <p>      WOULDN'T YOU KNOW: After an arduous battle, Martin      Greenwald won the right to link his two-kilowatt wind      generator to New York's Orange and Rockland Utilities      system in order to sell any surplus power at a "windmill      rate" ... only to receive a contract that calls for him to      pay minimum charges of "$4.07 monthly, not less than $24.42      per contract, plus $4.30 per kilowatt of windmill-generated      capacity per month" and $1.00 a month for an extra meter!    </p>    <p>      WAY-AHEAD CABOOSES: Southern Railway is so pleased with the      performance of the 22 cabooses it equipped with overhead      solar photovoltaic cells that the firm has ordered panels      for 58 more cars. The railroad has also installed solar      panels along its right-of-ways, to operate train detectors      and grade-crossing and signal lights.    </p>    <p>      PRESTIGE POWER: A University of Houston environmental      psychologist says that people who once took pride in having      the first color television set on the block are now      installing solar energy systems.... New Jersey lawmakers      asked Congress to authorize construction of a "TRASHOHOL"      PLANT to convert millions of tons of the state's garbage      into alcohol fuel.... Meanwhile, potato grower Farrell      Palmer of Aberdeen, Idaho turns his culls into ethanol by      FIRING HIS STILL WITH OLD CRANKCASE OIL from his farm      vehicles and a local service station The South African      Minister of Agriculture encourages that country's farmers      to grow sunflowers and ex iraci the plants' oil FOR USE IN      TRACTORS, INSTEAD OF EXPENSIVE DIESEL FUEL.... We thought      you'd like to know that there're two gasoline pumps in the      garage of the U.S. Senate, where top-ranking Democrats and      Republicans can buy fuel for-at last      report-JUST 67 cents A GALLON.    </p>
