                <p><strong>      To Alaska’s Helen Blanchard, getting “back to      basics” meant…</strong>    </p>        <p>      ----- REFORT FROM THEM THAT'S      DOIN' -----    </p>        <p>      Back in 1958, when Alaska was still a territory, my husband      and I carved out our own self-sustaining world-on      Gravina Island-under the Federal Homestead Act.    </p>    <p>      What did it cost? You might be surprised to learn that our      "piece of paradise" only set us back $85 for homesteading      fees and $4.00 for a roll of tar paper... to protect the      outer walls (under our hand-split cedar shakes) of our      driftwood log cabin from the constant dampness of      southeastern Alaska's coastal weather.    </p>    <h3>      CHILDHOOD LESSONS    </h3>    <p>      Doing without manufactured goods-and most of the      other folderol that many modern folk seem to think is      necessary for happiness-was a way of life in the      Ozark hills where my husband and I grew up. Our parents      took pleasure in hard work... and they taught us to work,      too!    </p>    <p>      In those not-so-long-ago days, chair frames were turned on      a foot-powered lathe and were bottomed with white oak      splints. Oak strips were also used to make baskets. Corn      shucks filled cotton ticking for bed pads... and      deliciously soft, warm, feather-filled mattresses were laid      on top. Our underwear was created from flour sacks, but the      rest of our clothes-made on a treadle      machine-were "store-boughten" cotton.    </p>    <p>      Even then, we knew we lived "modern" lives compared to      those our grandparents talked about, but-though we      <em>did</em> have "real" cloth-our family understood      that such material was a luxury .. to be conserved until      the rags of former outfits were used in rugs and each scrap      that was left over from the sewing became part of a quilt.    </p>    <p>      The fact is, the true homesteader has little need for      store-bought "newness". The homestead itself-with      satin-sleek newborn kids, silky soft rabbits, and fluffy      chicks-is always an exciting and ever-changing world      to those who are attuned to its wonders.    </p>        <h3>      KEEP IT SIMPLE    </h3>    <p>      Party line telephones were frowned on-in the Ozarks      of my childhood-as gossipy time wasters, and (though      many of our Alaskan neighbors "can't live without 'em") I      feel the same way about today's CB radios. "Visiting" by      means of such contraptions could, for instance, have cost      us the valuable time we used to build the solar greenhouse      that gives us fruit and vegetables right into December.    </p>    <p>      We don't have electricity either (after all, both my      husband and I lived the first 25 years of our lives without      utility power, and feel very comfortable with our      wood-burning stove and oil lamps), and-with the      exorbitant cost of electricity in Alaska-our      "sacrifice" amounts to real savings!    </p>    <p>      Though we don't keep an itemized list of everything we buy,      we <em>do</em> have a good idea of the cost of living on      our homestead. Our only luxury is a 55-gallon, $30 barrel      of white diesel fuel (that lasts a full year when burned in      our lamps)... and-since we raise forage crops and      utilize all our weeds and garden greens to feed our      animals-$600 buys a year's supply of grain and      alfalfa for our goats, rabbits, and chickens. In turn, the      critters more than earn the cost of their feed, especially      since I have customers who pay $1.00 for a quart of milk,      $1.25 for yogurt, and $1.25 for a dozen eggs. (And, of      course, our animals also furnish much of our food and      fertilizer.)    </p>    <h3>      FOOD FOR HEALTH AND INCOME    </h3>    <p>      Raising our own victuals is really all the health insurance      my husband and I need. With a year-round supply of      naturally grown potatoes and other root crops-plus      dried peas, cabbage, herbs, onions, garlic... and our own      canned garden produce-we don't have to buy much from      the store. The homestead, as noted, also provides us with      milk, meat, and eggs... and-from the surrounding      woods and beaches-we can obtain venison, mushrooms,      blueberries, red huckleberries, bog cranberries, fish, and      shellfish. However, to supplement this fare, I <em>do</em>      sometimes barter smoked fish for whole grains and honey.    </p>    <p>      In addition, those few things that <em>must</em> be      bought-such as feed, seeds, and plants-can be      absorbed into the homestead budget by raising one or two      crops that are locally in demand. In my teen years I sold      chickens to earn money... and in the Land of the Midnight      Sun organic eggs are eagerly sought after. One old-timer      here grew vegetables for years, and used a rowboat to      deliver his produce to the stores. He had no other means of      livelihood, yet the man raised a family <em>and</em> sent      his children to school.    </p>    <p>      My husband, who's a journeyman machinist, makes extra cash      by doing seasonal work-for a month or so in the      summer-at a local salmon cannery. He worries about      having money for hospital care in our old age... and is      saving to provide for such an eventuality.    </p>    <p>      Of course, I'm glad he's planning for the future, but I      don't worry about growing old at all... simply because I      figure to keep on homesteadin' forever!    </p>
