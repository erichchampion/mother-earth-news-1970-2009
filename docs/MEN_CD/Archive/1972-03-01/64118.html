                    <p>      We very much enjoyed MOTHER NO. 12 with its many      interesting and useful articles . . . as usual. However,      Paul was reading "Food Without Farming" while eating lunch      and it spoiled his meal completely.    </p>    <p>      First there was Mr. Churchill's description of catching,      killing and cooking pigeons. "We keep the pigeons in a cage      until we're ready to do something delectable with them", he      says, indicating his jolly sense of humor.    </p>    <p>      Next he discusses the "terrific" deer hunting in Wisconsin      where "an individual can legally harvest four deer a year.      Multiply this by the number of licenses in a family . . . a      total of approximately 100,000 deer are taken every year."      Quite the conservationist.    </p>    <p>      The part about snapping turtles hit closest to home since      we have a small, harmless and delightful snapper named      Otis. Imagine awakening a peacefully hibernating turtle      with "the largest fish hook you can find"! When Mr.      Churchill says to "give short quick jerks until he's hooked      underneath the rim of his shell," it appears to us that one      must inevitably impale the turtle with the hook. Snappers      are poorly protected underneath and it seems impossible      that one could hook them just by the rim of the shell . . .      it would be necessary to hook the flesh.    </p>    <p>      The horribly ironic thing about issue NO. 12 is that it      includes the insightful quotation from Joseph Wood Krutch      ("When a man wantonly destroys one of the works of man we      call him a vandal. When he wantonly destroys one of the      works of God, we call him a sportsman.") as well as the      grisly details of James E. Churchill's plundering and      killing.    </p>    <p>      Johanna and Paul Hutchinson<br />      St. Catharine, Ontario    </p>    <p>      I was extremely disturbed by James Churchill's "Food      Without Farming" in MOTHER NO. 12.    </p>    <p>      In case the author doesn't realize it, turtles are rapidly      becoming an endangered species. Although there's been no      "official" word, it appears that the number of turtles and      other reptiles in this country is rapidly decreasing.    </p>    <p>      The habitats of turtles, including snappers, are being      destroyed by the filling in of swamps and ponds for new      homes, shopping malls and highways (not to mention      landfills, etc.). Furthermore, turtles are often captured      right after birth (and then sold in huge quantities to pet      stores. Usually, through lack of knowledge or negligence,      they die soon after.    </p>    <p>      Snapping turtles are thought to be dangerous predators and      many people kill them on sight for this reason alone.      Actually, they serve a valuable ecological role: they're      aquatic scavengers who live off dead and decaying organic      matter (other dead and sick animals) and so help keep lakes      and ponds clean and prevent unhealthy species from      reproducing.    </p>    <p>      OK, that's the scientific part . . . turtles have a right      to live! There aren't many left and they should be      protected. But beside that, does Mr. Churchill think that      killing a <em>sleeping</em> (hibernating) snapper is sport?      Wow!    </p>    <p>      I've taught biology and also run an environmental nature      zoo, so I've had plenty of opportunity to observe snappers      and other turtles. They're quite intelligent, and kids      really dig learning about them and watching their      activities. These kids - and all people - must      be taught to respect life and not be hung up on killing . .      . ESPECIALLY if animals like the snapper are having a hard      time surviving.    </p>    <p>      Churchill's article reminded me of the hunter-oriented      magazines I see on the newsstands . . . there's already      been enough destruction of wildlife. Shouldn't you, MOTHER,      be more responsible (you usually are) about what you print?      Churchill's article was a down.    </p>    <p>      Barry Oblas<br />      Philadelphia    </p>    <p>      It's always amazing that no one ever questions the idea of      foraging wild plants . . . but a great hue and cry      <em>always</em> goes up when anyone suggests adding wild      birds and animals to the diet. Barry, Johanna and Paul      raise admittedly valid points here . . . but overlook, I      think, much larger points which are just as valid.    </p>    <p>      There is no question that shopping centers and subdivisions      are infringing on the natural habitat of snapping turtles,      as Barry suggests . . . but other works of man are vastly      increasing that same habitat. During the past 30 years,      thousands and thousands and thousands of homestead and farm      ponds have been built in this country and - as a      Midwest farm boy - I know firsthand that this has      created hundreds of thousands of acres of new turtle homes      . . . well-stocked with the young fingerling fish and      waterfowl that snapping turtles so dearly love. I don't      have any figures to back my feeling (only in-the-field      observations) but I think a survey might well prove that      the number of snapping turtles in this country is presently      <em>increasing. .</em>    </p>    <p>      Now, I know how easily it is to get overwrought about      catching, killing and eating wild game . . . but I also      wonder just what Paul was eating at that lunch we spoiled?      Hope it wasn't hamburger or steak or pork chops or chicken      or even fish fillets. Take a little trip through a      slaughterhouse (where all the killing and cutting is done      for us "civilized" folks) the next time you're in town . .      . and you may have a little more tolerance for those of us      honest enough to harvest our meals on a one-to-one basic.    </p>    <p>      Which brings up another point. It ain't enough just to be      "agin". Supposedly, MOTHER readers are interested in      getting away from the artificial and "back" to a more      natural life . . . but some of us seem to have given little      thought to what we're running <em>to</em> . It would seem      to me that living in natural harmony with a region would      mean subsisting on the plants and animals native to that      region. Sending our cows and pigs and chickens land maybe      the white man!) back to Europe and Asia - for      instance - and learning to "farm" turtles, buffalo      and rabbits once again . . . to use this continent as an      example.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the vegetarians among us feel that they've      sidestepped the whole issue when they refuse to eat meat,      eggs and related products . . . but I notice that most of      them continue to wear leather shoes and I've always      wondered what they think about the experiments that "prove"      that plants have extremely sensitive feelings too.    </p>    <p>      It's awful hard to make judgments that will stick when all      the facts are in, isn't it? - J S.    </p>
