                <p>      <strong>Report From Them That's Doin'<br /></strong></p>            <p>      Now that we're settled on our homestead here in Costa Rica      and have some time for something other than coffee picking      and gardening, I thought I'd drop you folks a line.    </p>    <p>      It's the rainy season now so we have all the natural      irrigation we can use . . . and more. Our gardens are      planted and we've been eating fresh carrots, peas, lettuce      and garlic for a while now and there's still much more to      come yet.    </p>    <p>      A while back we bought an old gray mare for $20 and she      helps us get our main crop-coffee-to market.      It's a shame that we have to sell all our delicious      organically grown beans to the big-money coffee people.      We're frantically trying to rustle up a way to sell direct      to folks in the States-perhaps to communes or some      such-and ship them by land or water. (Air freight      costs are about $1.00 a pound . . . obviously impractical.)    </p>    <p>      Another family is expected to join us soon and by spring      we'll be farming our 15 1/2, acres cooperatively, It'll be      wonderful to have a few friends nearby to share all the fun      (and all the work, too).    </p>    <p>      Since arriving in Costa Rica, we've been corresponding and      swapping seeds and warm weather farming information with      some folks we've met through CONTACT. They've been a great      help to us since the information in most organic gardening      magazines and articles we've found is pertinent to      temperate climates only. There is, however, an excellent      book on tropical small farming called <em>THE FARMER'S      S</em> GUIDE, available through the Jamaica Agricultural      Society. It touches on everything from livestock to cover      crops to good varieties of vegetables for our climate. Best      of all its emphasis is on organic methods and chemicals are      given little mention. We've read and researched every book      on tropical agriculture we could get our hands on, and this      one is the best by far. We hope to write about some of our      own experiments and adaptations, and will send them along      once we're sure they work.    </p>    <p>      As soon as we can get it together, we'll send you a sample      of our very own homestead-produced, roasted and packed      coffee beans. Until then, thank you for the help you've      been to us. If it hadn't been for those first few hopeful      issues our family would still be in Boston, thinking the      big move wasn't practical.    </p>
