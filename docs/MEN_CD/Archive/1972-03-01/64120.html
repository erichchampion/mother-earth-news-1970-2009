                   <h5 id="byline">      by JOHN KRILL    </h5>    <p>      If you're young and lazy, old and feeble or just plain busy      . . . you can reap rich garden harvests on slim      expenditures of time and physical exertion by putting a rug      in your produce patch. What's more, this gardening method      requires no tilling of the soil, no cultivating, no weeding      and no machinery in the form of tractors or gas powered      tillers. The technique will allow you-in a matter of      hours-to start a vegetable plot that will literally      maintain itself, even on tough sod. Only the fall frosts      will put an end to such a garden's unattended productivity.    </p>    <p>      Most of the few things you'll need for this "no work" way      of gardening can be found at residential curbsides on      rubbish disposal days or in the town dump: one or more      discarded rugs, a knife, a spade, a wheelbarrow      and-if it's available-some compost or manure.    </p>    <p>      Spread the carpet or carpets bottom-side-up on your garden      site in the fall or at least a month before planting time      in the spring. The covering will soon choke out all the      grass and weeds beneath it, eliminating the need to plow or      till the soil.    </p>    <p>      When you're ready to plant, cut one-foot squares from the      rug, as shown in Fig. 1. For tomatoes, space the squares      three feet apart in rows three feet apart. Separate the      planting holes by two feet in each direction for green      peppers, cucumbers and cantaloupes. Remember to leave a      broad margin of carpet around the edges on which the      cucumber, melon and other vines may spread (Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      Place your wheelbarrow near each freshly-cut-out square and      dig a 15" deep hole at every location (Fig. 3). Dump the      soil into the barrow, mix it 50-50 with manure or compost,      and fill each excavation with the mixture. Be sure to tamp      all but the last four inches of the soil-compost      combination well as you refill the holes. This will prevent      later settling that might leave your plants sitting in      depressions. New plants form poor root systems in compacted      soil, however, so the top four-inch layer of each little      plot must be left loose to allow each plant to establish      itself quickly and vigorously.    </p>    <p>      You're now ready to place cucumber or melon seeds or pepper      or tomato sets in each location (Fig. 4). Water well after      planting. Except for pulling an occasional weed from the      squares, that's it until harvest time (Fig. 5).    </p>    <p>      Your garden will need no more watering . . . the rug allows      rain to seep through its weave, then retains the moisture      by protecting the soil from the sun as it retards      evaporation. Insect pests mostly avoid a carpeted vegetable      patch because there are no weeds or loose soil for them to      hide in. You won't even need to stake the tomatoes since      they'll be lying on a clean surface with no dirt to blemish      them. Picking your produce in even the rainiest weather      will be a mud-free task.    </p>    <p>      I've found these scavenged floor coverings to be far      superior to the newly-popular plastic sheet mulches. The      rugs admit rather than repel rainwater, need no weights to      hold them down, cost nothing and (assuming they're wool or      cotton) decompose after a few seasons to provide a garden      with valuable organic matter.    </p>    <p>      Once started, a carpeted garden cares little if you're      present. We've taken long trips during the growing season      and returned to ours to harvest ripe produce that had done      splendidly with no care at all . . . and, when we stay at      home, I can now squander the long hours I used to spend on      garden drudgery. In my more than 50 years of raising home      vegetables, I've yet to find an easier, more efficient way      to produce a yearly crop of fresh-grown food.    </p>
