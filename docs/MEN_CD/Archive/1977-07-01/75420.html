                    			<hr />      <p>      I make my living translating books from French for      hard-nosed New York City publishers (no swapping      <em>there</em> , I'm afraid). But here in Woodstock we have      something we call "the energy exchange". Everyone's into      it, because-while money is scarce here-talent      is plentiful.    </p>    <p>      For instance, I study astrology and have developed some      skill in reading horoscopes. Since many people who want      readings can't afford to pay for them, and since I wouldn't      feel right taking money for what I think of as spiritual      counseling anyway, the energy exchange provides the perfect      solution.    </p>    <p>      The goods and services I've received in return for chart      readings include: haircuts, carpentry, medical services,      dinners, art works, therapy sessions, lessons in      self-hypnosis and auto mechanics, organic vegetables, and      psychic healing.    </p>    <p>      But my favorite exchange was the time I read a friend's      chart for 62 sheepskins. She and her old man were moving      away, and the fleeces that had lined their dome would have      otherwise gone to the dump. I traded some of the skins for      wood splitting and gave some of them away, but the rest are      right here on the floor of my cabin, keeping my feet warm      as I type!    </p>    <p>      Helen Weaver<br />      Woodstock, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      Last fall we splurged on a night's entertainment at a local      folk music coffeehouse . . . and loved it! Still, we      realized we just couldn't afford to frequent the place.    </p>    <p>      Undaunted, we offered the proprietress our      assistance-setting up, preparing refreshments,      cleaning up, etc.-in exchange for free admission. To      our surprise, she exclaimed that she'd been wanting just      such an arrangement! So now we often enjoy an evening's      earful of great music . . . <em>and</em> get to participate      in the fun of the whole operation besides!    </p>    <p>      And here's Terrific Swap Number Two: Mary's always looking      for natural dyes for her handspinning, and one day after a      rainstorm we came upon some black walnuts that had been      washed down from somewhere. We did some sleuthing, and      determined the origin of our find: the yard of one of our      town's more "socially prominent" people. I was afraid we'd      reached an impasse, but Mary persevered. And-when      approached-the woman in question offered <em>us</em>      this trade: all the black walnuts we could collect just for      hauling them away from her yard because they were "in the      way of the lawn mower".    </p>    <p>      We trucked our ten bushels home in high spirits. As Mary      says, it never hurts to ask!    </p>    <p>      Richard & Mary French<br />      Bolton Landing, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      After six months in the wilds of West Virginia, I'm      convinced that it's more satisfying to "horse-trade" with      folks than to pass greenbacks.    </p>    <p>      My first experience with the pleasures of barter occurred      when I traveled to a nearby town's fall festival. I tried      selling my handcrafted jewelry at the sidewalk flea market,      and found that I sold less than I traded. To be perfectly      honest, popular response to my work was somewhat meager . .      . but the other peddlers were eager to swap!    </p>    <p>      My day's wages included au antique bottle capper, fresh      fruit, wall hangings, apple cider, and honey. I even gained      admission to a tavern at day's end to hear a fine hammered      dulcimer band . . . in exchange for a bracelet.    </p>    <p>      By the way, those who lack their own handicrafts needn't      despair: I constantly exchange work and favors with my      neighbors. For instance, in return for helping pick corn,      I've been given enough ground corn, fodder, and baled hay      to allow me to winter my cow cost-free!    </p>    <p>      The amount of money you save by swapping is considerable,      but what gives me my real kick is that slight grin that      creeps over the other guy's face when you ask, "Wanna      trade?"    </p>    <p>      Doug Nestor<br />      Gay, W.Va.    </p>    <p>      I earn my main livelihood as an electrician      (self-employed), and there aren't too many "longhair"      electricians in this town of 3,000, so the serious      back-to-the-landers frequently ask for my assistance.    </p>    <p>      It seems most of these people are either working in the      construction trades, building their own places, or both . .      . so I'm often called upon to wire their houses, set up      welders, "energize" their wells (what pleasure to see      someone's tears of joy at the first sight of water on their      land!), or what have you.    </p>    <p>      In return for my work, I've been given a beautiful wood      stove, haircuts for my whole family, a brand-new Skilsaw,      all the firewood we can use, thoughtful personal gifts, and      on and on.    </p>    <p>      Nobody keeps records of who owes who . . . it's all just      done. <em>My</em> pleasure is in knowing I've helped, and      also in knowing I can turn to these like-minded friends and      neighbors for help in return.    </p>    <p>      Jack Vaughan<br />      Nevada City, Calif.    </p>    <p>      My current life in the city restricts most of the country      living habits I enjoyed earlier in life. I'm glad to say,      though, that my down-home indulgence in barter works just      as well in town as it ever did out in the sticks.    </p>    <p>      I've been unemployed for a couple of months, and have found      myself with a lot of time and no money. So last week I      started putting my chain saw to work.    </p>    <p>      I cut down a tree for the wood, and traded the wood to a      friend for repairs made on my freezer. Then I cut another,      larger tree down in exchange for an axle I wanted for a      trailer I'm building. And I did some concrete work for      another pal in return for a lawn edger.    </p>    <p>      I've not only made worthwhile trades, you see . . . I've      met some good people, kept busy, worked constructively, and      never had to worry about exchanging money.    </p>    <p>      Barter always reminds me that there's more to life than      running down to the corner store.    </p>    <p>      Joe McGillivray<br />      Phoenix, Ariz.    </p>    <p>      I've lived in Colorado for some time now and have spent      countless hours in the mountains, under many different      weather conditions. Though most folks in this region know      how unpredictable the elements can be in high country,      accidents and exposure still take lives every year.    </p>    <p>      Well, I've always been one to learn from others'      experiences if possible (rather than finding things out the      hard way), so I decided to take a mountain survival course.    </p>    <p>      Then I realized that tracking down training I could afford      was going to be the problem. I wasn't having much luck      until one day, while talking to a new friend, I discovered      that he did volunteer work for a local mountain rescue      organization. My acquaintance mentioned that he was      planning a survival course much like the one I was looking      for . . . and went on to complain about all the typing,      phone calls, and general office work involved in getting      the project underway. Naturally I immediately saw the      perfect solution to two problems: Why couldn't I do the      necessary clerical chores in return for free enrollment in      the class?    </p>    <p>      My offer was accepted and I'm now tromping about the      mountainsides with a little more wilderness wisdom . . .      and a lot more respect for the magnificent forces of      nature.    </p>    <p>      Janet Chappell<br />      Colorado Springs, Colo.    </p>    <p>      Since moving to the country, we've established "trade      relations" with three different families. In each case, the      friendship that's blossomed is a result of the swap that      originally got us acquainted.    </p>    <p>      In the first instance, when I enrolled our son in a      pre-school that's quite some distance away, I      philosophically accepted the daily chore of getting him      there. Then I found a way to share the driving with a      neighbor. Once a week, she takes our boy to his school      while I drive her daughter to hers (which is relatively      near). My friend does what she needs to do in town on that      day, and I have more time at home.    </p>    <p>      A second friendship started when another new acquaintance      got interested in the sled dogs we keep. We taught him all      we know about the animals, and last winter he helped my      husband train and run them.    </p>    <p>      Lastly, we exchange some of nature's abundance with still a      third family. They've given us raspberry starts and a row      of poplars, and we've shared cucumbers, pansies, and      strawberry plants with <em>them</em> .    </p>    <p>      Swapping is such fun, and once you get in the habit it's      just second nature!    </p>    <p>      Sandra Diedrich<br />      Gig Harbor, Wash.    </p>    <p>      My favorite form of barter is hitchhiking! When that car      pulls over, it's up to the thumber to find out what his/her      part of the bargain is. Most often it's      companionship-many's the tired driver I've kept awake      with my travelin' stories-but it could be almost      anything: taking a turn behind the wheel, providing an      "audience" (lots of folks like to tell jokes or brag about      their own exploits), or serving as map reader. Once, in      Vermont, I got a ride from some people who had lost their      dog. As it happened, I found the critter . . . and they      were so grateful they bought me dinner and drove me halfway      through the state!    </p>    <p>      Shel Horowitz<br />      Providence, R.I.    </p>    <p>      Right now I'm traveling (Thank you, MOTHER, for the courage      to try!) . . . picking fruit and working toward an eventual      patch of my own soil.    </p>    <p>      When I left the city, I needed a place to leave my      furniture and clothes but had no funds for storage. So      here's what I did.    </p>    <p>      One clothes-loving friend has my Goodwill and antique finds      hanging in her closet, to wear as she pleases. Another,      whose new job required an immediate wardrobe of dresses,      has that presently (to me) useless portion of my apparel in      safekeeping. And still another friend, who'd just moved      into an unfurnished place, has the use of my furniture.    </p>    <p>      It all feels much better than putting my well-loved things      into cold storage, and in this way several people-as      well as myself-are helped financially.    </p>    <p>      I find that swapping is not only more economical for all      involved, but it helps restore us to that healthy realm      where friendship, work, and play are interdependent.    </p>    <p>      Michelle Miller<br />      Enroute, U.S.A.    </p>    <p>      When a friend and I planned a backpacking trip into the      Adirondacks to climb Mt. Marcy, I found I had one major      problem: Since I'd never yet done any serious hiking, my      equipment for the climb consisted of one lone knapsack.    </p>    <p>      One of my co-workers heard me talking about the upcoming      trip and-since he happened to be a salesman for Mason      shoes-asked if I had a good pair of hiking boots.      When I admitted I didn't, he promptly showed me a Mason      catalog that featured a really rugged-looking pair.    </p>    <p>      The boots looked great, but their price was almost as steep      as the mountain I wanted to climb! Yet, just as I was      resigning myself to the use of a pair of worn-out work      shoes, this fellow asked me what I might be able to trade.    </p>    <p>      We soon made a deal: I'd supply my Mason man with fresh,      high-protein eggs laid by my organically raised Barred Rock      hens until the boots were paid for.    </p>    <p>      When I finally reached the summit of Mt. Marcy, I was ever      so thankful (and my feet even more so!) for the age-old      custom of barter.    </p>    <p>      Richard Vann<br />      Earlville, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      I once met an old, widowed farmer who was such a good      person that I decided to give him something simply for      being who he was.    </p>    <p>      I knew just what that something should be, too.    </p>    <p>      When we were introduced, it had come into the conversation      that this fellow's late wife had made an unforgettable      apple-sauce-raisin-spice cake. He was so sure I'd like it      that he'd given me the recipe.    </p>    <p>      Well, I used that old recipe to bake him a cake,      and-since he wasn't home when I delivered      it-left it on his front porch with a note.    </p>    <p>      What happened next was quite unexpected. My new friend      telephoned to say he loved the cake . . . and to ask if I'd      be interested in a garden plot! Since I lived (at that      time) in an apartment, I was elated. And when I went out to      cultivate We patch, I found he'd already prepared my soil      along with his own!    </p>    <p>      We worked side by side in both gardens, sharing the work      and the fun. I got a garden full of vegetables and a      forevermore friendship . . . and all because of a cake. (Or      was it because of the love behind the cake?    </p>    <p>      Marty Person<br />      Kansas City, Mo.    </p>    <p>      When I first moved to this part of the Alaska bush, I noted      the tractors, Cats, and other advantageous equipment in my      neighbors' yards and wondered how I'd ever survive: My only      piece of machinery was a typewriter.    </p>    <p>      Yet, over the years, my work at that typewriter has      provided gravel for the driveway, Cat work, firewood,      groceries, and furs.    </p>    <p>      In addition, I once traded some of my homemade jams and      jellies for a Franklin stove . . . and <em>that</em> was      later swapped for a Cole airtight heater. My other barters      include on-call help at a local roadhouse for labor      (result: a shallow well pounded in and chimney safeties      installed) and more surplus preserves for a hungry      bachelor's mechanical expertise (which has kept my new      garden tractor in top shape).    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the ultimate in bartering (for me, anyway) was      reached when a miner in the nearby hills wanted some of my      kippered salmon. No mere gold dust would I accept for that      precious stuff . . . he got his salmon and <em>I</em> got      two nicely matched gold nuggets for earrings!    </p>    <p>      Patricia Oakes<br />      Central, Alaska    </p>    <p>      My wife Anne and I have successfully battered our way      across Europe. Several summers ago, we traveled through      France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway on practically no cash.      We wanted to see more of the countryside and its people      than of the cities, and we usually exchanged our labor for      "tent and board" at farms along our way. We were always      treated wonderfully and, indeed, any groaning heard      resulted not from the work we did but from the abundance at      the dinner table!<br />    </p>    <p>      This year finds us in Germany, where our best barter yet is      with the art college where Anne now studies. I work in the      school garden (I'm a trained horticulturist) in exchange      for Anne's tuition and our living expenses.    </p>    <p>      Smaller swaps are practiced between the college and some of      its neighbors. For instance, the local "shepherd ladies"      (an opera singer and a photographer by profession, but they      prefer the country life) supply us with sheep manure in      return for a bit of pasture at the school.    </p>    <p>      Through bartering, the things we need seem to fall into our      laps . . . and our experiences have shown us that destiny      needn't always be determined by the crisp flick of the      Almighty Mark or Dollar.    </p>    <p>      Craig & Anne Riedel-Cook<br />      Alfter bei Bonn, Germany    </p>    <p>      The youngsters of today who go forth and seek new places,      build their own homes, and grow their own produce are      wonderful . . . but I would have them know that there were      those of us with the same visions and aspirations 30 years      ago.    </p>    <p>      We left Miami, Florida in a "covered wagon" truck      constructed by my husband and son . . . destination Maine.      Among our few possessions was a handsome black marbled      toilet seat of solid wood that I'd won in a radio contest.    </p>    <p>      To shorten a long story, we arrived, bought a $2,600 farm      with $150 down, and went to the nearest secondhand shop in      search of furniture.    </p>    <p>      There I was distracted from our purpose by the most      beautiful old parlor pump organ. How my heart and soul      coveted it!    </p>    <p>      "How much?" I asked.    </p>    <p>      "Tain't wuth much," the man said. "Got anything to swap?"    </p>    <p>      I offered him my fancy bathroom throne, and we soon struck      a bargain.    </p>    <p>      My husband and I have made many other good trades over the      years-mostly labor for labor (another      story)-but none so satisfactory as that      pump-organ-for-a-toilet-seat deal!    </p>    <p>      Irene Harvey<br />      Stockton Springs, Maine    </p>    <p>      After just a couple of weeks at my part-time office job, I      saw clearly that my nursing infant couldn't handle that      much separation from me. (And his daddy saw this even      <em>more</em> clearly!) So I quit my job for the sake of      family harmony . . . but that put the same old      uncomfortable squeeze on our budget.    </p>    <p>      Then one day, while browsing through our local natural food      store, I jestingly asked the owner (a friend) if he needed      a bookkeeper. To my great surprise, he answered, "I didn't      know you were a bookkeeper! Wow, we could really use      someone to do our books. And we'll give you some food for      it!"    </p>    <p>      So here I am with a part-time job again. Only-this      time-I can not only set my own hours but bring my son      with me (no problem nursing a hungry baby <em>there</em> ).      And, best of all, I quite literally "bring home the bread".    </p>    <p>      Janet Colyard<br />      Bricktown, N.J.    </p>
