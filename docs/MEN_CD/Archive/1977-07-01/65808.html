            <p>      Issue # 46 - July/August 1977    </p>				       <p>      This feature excerpted from <em>Design for a</em>      <em>Limited Planet</em> by Norma Skurka and Jon Naar,      copyright Â© 1976 by Norma Skurka and Jon Naar,      reprinted by permission of Ballantine Books (a division of      Random House, Inc.) . . . available from any good bookstore      for $5.95 (or from Mother's Bookshelf for $5.95 plus      75 cents postage and handling).    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <strong>While most everybody else is still just      <em>talking</em> about the problems of the energy crisis, a      few folks-such as the natural-energy leaders featured      in a little book called <em>Design for a Limited      Planet</em> -have quietly gone ahead and changed to      cleaner, more basic, and less costly (in terms of both the      individual and the planet) ways of heating and cooling      their homes. Here, three of those pioneering families tell      how they built their solar homes and describe what it's      like to live on more intimate terms with Ole Sol.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>"We live beneath an umbrella of nature . . . oaks,      birches, maples."</strong>    </p>		     <p>      Sydell and Steven Lipson (who was working in his father's      florist shop in New Haven, Connecticut) wanted to build a      "live-in" greenhouse-one large, plant-filled space      that would get most of its heating from the sun. They had      seen the experimental house with transparent plastic walls      that architect Mark Hildebrand had built for himself in the      woods, and they asked him for a refined version that could      be bank-financed. The Lipsons' 4-acre plot is next to a      forest preserve in the conservative township of Hamden,      Connecticut. Their "street-conscious" neighbors "didn't      want a bomb on the street," says architect Hildebrand, so      the design of the house had to be appropriate to the      community.    </p>    <p>      His design for the Lipsons' house appears to run counter to      energy-saving theories because three walls of the house are      transparent. They are made of two sheets of hermetically      sealed polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic with an air space      in between. Hildebrand had first seen the "pillow" walls      used in Colorado and had tried it out on his own house      before adapting the technique for the Lipsons' house. "I      was experimenting with industrial materials to replace      timber construction and thought of plastic because it was      economical," he explains. The PVC he chose had good      standards for longevity and visual clarity. But the      material, used commercially for packing and wrapping, is      thought of as disposable and, if subjected to stress, can      become brittle and crack.    </p>    <p>      "We had to design the pillows and install them so that in      erection or inflation, they would never be taxed," says      Hildebrand. When inflated, the skin stiffens and the      plastic forms both the interior and exterior surfaces. The      pillows are clamped in place with extruded aluminum frames,      similar to the ones that hold storefront windows.    </p>    <p>      The advantage of the plastic pillows, according to      Hildebrand, is that they insulate as well as Thermopane      glass-at about one-tenth the cost. However, because      of the impermanence of plastic, the pillows will probably      have to be replaced every three to five years, adding to      maintenance costs.    </p>    <p>      Since so much of the house is transparent, its siting and      profile had to be carefully planned. The roof is angled      upward toward the south, creating a two-story living room      with maximum exposure to the sun, while the north profile      is low, heavily insulated, and windowless except for a back      door. A roof overhang juts out enough to shield the pillow      walls in summer but allows the sun to penetrate all the way      to the north wall in winter. The living area is essentially      one space for living and dining with a separate sleeping      loft. The kitchen and bath are tucked under the low north      side.    </p>    <p>      Rather than clear the site, the Lipsons kept as many trees      as possible for natural climate control. In summer, the      leafy trees shade the house, while in winter their bare      limbs let the sun through. "Without ventilation," says      Sydell Lipson, "the interiors can get up to 120 degrees."      The house is designed for natural gravitation of air      through vents-placed low on the north side and high      on the south-that set up a strong air current through      the interiors. "In the winter, we open the vents for two or      three hours during the day and close them around the middle      of the afternoon, when it's about 85 degrees, to conserve      heat for the evening," she explains. On cold nights they      start a fire in their Franklin stove, consuming about 3      cords of wood for the heating season.    </p>    <p>      Connecticut building codes stipulate that all four walls of      a dwelling must be able to be heated to an average 68      degrees, which necessitated an auxiliary heat source. The      Lipsons chose a type of electric heater commonly used in      theater lobbies. It is relatively inexpensive but eats up a      lot of electricity. The Lipsons rely on their electric      heaters only in the dead of winter. And yet the electricity      bills are low, running an average of about $35 per month in      winter and $40 for the coldest month, January.    </p>    <p>      Concessions must be made to living in a house with no      central heating system. "Most people find our house chilly      in winter," says Sydell, "but you learn to live and dress      differently." The Lipsons also tend to use the house in      zones. Some areas are warm, and others are allowed to      become quite cool. The area within 12 feet of the      wood-burning stove (which is set on tiles to absorb and      radiate the heat) and the kitchen, which receives warmth      from cooking, are used intensively.    </p>    <p>      The 36-by-32-foot house cost the couple $30,000 to build,      but they economized by doing most of the work themselves.      They had no building experience, nor were they even      particularly handy, and it took them five months to build      the house.    </p>    <p>      "The house suits our lifestyle," Mrs. Lipson says. "We like      living in the woods. There is a certain joy in living in a      cool environment. I now find I don't function very well in      a house with central heating; it dulls me and makes me      sleepy."    </p>    <p>      <strong>"You live differently in a solar house. We are much      more aware of what the weather is doing."<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      In its first year of operation, Norah and Richard Davis's      solar house attracted two thousand tourists. "We finally      had to put up a 'No Trespassing' sign," Richard Davis said.      A transplanted southerner who went north to Bar Harbor,      Maine, to teach philosophy at The College of the Atlantic,      Professor Davis wanted to build a house out of recycled      materials. On the advice of a colleague at the college,      architect Ernest McMullen, his plans were expanded to      include a solar heating system.    </p>    <p>      Locating recycled materials wasn't that easy, although the      Davises did discover some interesting "finds": the ballroom      floor, doors, and 12-foot-long counters . . . from the      Evelyn Walsh McLean mansion (she was famous for owning the      Hope Diamond, now in the Smithsonian Institution);      structural timbers from a razed sardine factory; and a      2,000-gallon gasoline tank from a filling station to store      their solar-heated water. "We didn't save much money using      recycled materials," Richard says, "but we got materials we      couldn't otherwise afford-the 1-1/2-inch solid wood      doors and the quarter-sawn oak floors, for instance."    </p>    <p>      The Davis house is a compact, 1,300-square-foot building      with an open interior plan for the living-dining-kitchen      area, two bedrooms, and a utility room. Expenses came to      about $30,000.    </p>    <p>      The solar collectors, a trim bank of 26-foot-long      fiber-glass-faced panels, take up about half of the      southern facade of the house; a greenhouse that opens to      the kitchen and a deck occupy the rest of the front.    </p>    <p>      The house conforms to McMullen's-and a growing number      of other architects'-concept of energy-saving design:      that the right combination of materials for thermal mass,      siting, and fenestration will keep a house significantly      warmer in winter regardless of climate, without having to      install expensive solar hardware. A design change advocated      by engineers and architects concerned about fuel waste is      incorporated in the Davis house: instead of conventional      two-by-fours, the building is framed with two-by-eight      studs to make a deeper recess for wall insulation. The      house is insulated with 7 inches of fiberglass batts in the      walls and 9-1/2 inches in the ceiling.    </p>    <p>      McMullen's solar design combines features of the basic      water, air-to-rock, and greenhouse solar heat systems. The      roof-mounted collector is composed of corrugated aluminum      sheeting under fiberglass. Water is piped up to a feeder      pipe at the top of the corrugated sheeting, where it      trickles down the gullies and is heated by the sun to 120      degrees. The water collects in a trough at the bottom of      the collector, and from there it flows down into a      2,000-gallon water storage tank that is embedded in a rock      bin below the house. Beneath the rock bin is a manifold      constructed out of standard concrete block. Air is      circulated through the manifold, picking up heat from the      rock bin, and then distributed through ducts to the rooms.      The hot water supply is also tied into the solar system.    </p>    <p>      The Davises found that a larger-capacity storage tank would      have given the house more heat. Their 2,000-gallon tank was      supposed to store enough heat for three successive cloudy      days-but they forgot to take into account Maine's      strong coastal winds.    </p>    <p>      "If we have sunny winter days that aren't too windy, with      temperatures around 30 degrees, we can just get by on the      solar heating system. If it starts to go below 30 degrees      and the wind picks up, we have to resort to our      wood-burning furnace," Davis explains.    </p>    <p>      "We have adjusted to the fact that a solar house isn't      capable of responding rapidly to changes in temperature,"      he adds. "For instance, if we come home at night and the      inside temperature has dropped to the mid-50's, it takes a      while for the stored heat to warm the house up to the 60's.      In early winter, we keep the house at 70 degrees, but as it      gets colder, we feel comfortable at 65 degrees. You live      differently in a solar house," he says. "We are much more      aware of what the weather is doing."    </p>    <p>      <strong>"In the next ten years the architectural landscape      of this country will change radically."</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Environmental architect David Wright developed a simple way      to heat a house by the sun that has worked in different      regions and different climates. A Berkeley-educated      ex-Peace Corps member, Wright was one of the original      members of Sun Mountain Design, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a      non-profit group of engineers, builders, and architects      involved in solar-tempered design. They approached land      use, development, design, and research synergistically,      learning from their various disciplines. David, like the      others, prefers non-mechanical sun-heated houses to those      with complicated systems involving collectors, storage, and      circulation systems.    </p>    <p>      His own house on the outskirts of Santa Fe, in the      foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, is a prototype      of the non. mechanical structures he advocates. The only      visible hardware is a small separate solar collector that      stands several yards from the house on the south slope and      supplies the house with hot water.    </p>    <p>      In appearance, the house blends harmoniously with the      native New Mexican architecture. It uses adobe brick, and      the roof overhang echoes the traditional <em>vigas</em> ,      or roof beams, that extend out through the walls of old      adobe houses. Its inspiration goes even farther      back-to the twelfth-century pueblo dwellings at Chaco      Canyon, considered by many to be America's first      solar-heated habitations on a grand scale. At Chaco Canyon,      the multifamily structures that were archetypal apartment      buildings to house a whole community were built in an arc.      The windows and doorways faced south, into the sun, while      the backs of the pueblos were shielded by the hillside,      giving them protection from northern winds.    </p>    <p>      The Wright house reflects that same design. From a      bird's-eye view, it is shaped like a semicircle with a flat      front. The curved walls are 14-inch-thick adobe brick with      2 more inches of polyurethane insulation covered by a thick      layer of stucco. The flat front, facing south, is a      two-story-high window wall made up of double-glazed sliding      doors. An overhang shields the windows from the hottest      summer sun. In contrast to the front, the three remaining      sides of the house are surrounded by an earth bank and      broken only by a few small windows set high up to act as      vents. On the east, the main entry door is protected by a      vestibule that creates an air trap so warm house air can't      escape each time the door is opened.    </p>    <p>      David, with his wife, Barbara, built the house almost      single-handedly with some subcontracting for electrical and      plumbing work and a couple of part-time crews who worked      two-week stints. The house took them less than six months      to complete and cost the couple around $13,000, not      counting their own labor. The interior is basically a      two-story-high room with a balcony. Although the house is      small, the window wall gives the interior a feeling of      generous space.    </p>    <p>      David Wright's concept of a solar "heat sink", such as the      one they adopted in this house, was popular in the late      1930's. Houses were marketed and sold as "solar houses",      but they never adequately solved the basic problem: what to      do with the excess heat during the day and how to stem the      heat loss at night. (Night losses usually exceed the daily      heat gains.) Superior insulation and the thermal building      mass of adobe were Wright's solution to that problem. To      augment the natural insulation provided by the adobe walls,      fifteen 50-gallon water-filled oil drums, buried beneath      the living room window, soak up the sun's warmth. Water      holds about four times as much heat as adobe, and also      absorbs it and gives it off faster. To further reduce heat      loss at night, accordion-fold shutters made of canvas and      2-inch polyurethane panels are raised and lowered by a      hand-operated crank and pulley to cover the vast expanse of      the window wall at night.    </p>    <p>      Since completion, the house has required practically no      maintenance. The Wrights found that space heating based on      the concept of thermal lag follows natural rhythms and puts      the body's metabolism in tune with it. "The body heats up      and cools down gradually with the building," David      explains. During the winter months the Wrights found that      the house stores about five days' worth of heat, enough to      carry through an average cloudy period in New Mexico. For      auxiliary heat, they have a wood-burning Franklin stove,      which uses less than a cord of wood a year.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The complete, 215-page book, Design for a      Limited Planet, may be purchased from any good bookstore or      ordered for $5.95 (plus 75 cents shipping) from Mother's      Bookshelf, P.O.
