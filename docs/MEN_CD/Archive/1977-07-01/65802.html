                    <hr />    <p>      <strong>Most gardeners pass up the chance to grow their own      berry fruits . . . which is a shame, because do-it-yourself      strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and grapes are [1]      better tasting, [2] more healthful (no pesticide residues),      and [3] more economical than their store-bought      counterparts. Not only that, but berry plants are easy to      grow, highly ornamental in some cases, and . . . well,      we'll let Derek Fell take it from here!</strong><br />      <br />    </p>                                    <p>      Crisp salad greens, luscious ripe tomatoes, and tender,      juice-filled melons are all satisfying in their own way and      no garden should be without them. For me, though, the      ultimate taste thrill is provided by the berry fruits . . .      freshpicked strawberries, raspberries, blackberries,      blueberries, and grapes in particular. I value these crops      so highly that I make special forays into the back country      each summer to go after the wild ones . . . even though I      grow large quantities of the same delightful delicacies in      my own garden!    </p>    <p>      Below, I'd like to share with you a few thoughts and      suggestions on backyard berry production, in the hope that      I can convince you to begin growing strawberries and grapes      and bramble fruits yourself.    </p>    <h3>      THE MOST PRODUCTIVE BERRY OF THEM ALL    </h3>    <p>      Strawberries-because they produce a large amount of      fruit in a relatively small area-are among the most      productive (and most rewarding) of all berry fruits. If      you've never grown your own, now's the time to start.    </p>    <p>      You can plant strawberries in spring, summer, or fall. Fall      is probably the best time of all, since plants put in the      ground then will develop strong root systems during the      cool autumn months and break out into vigorous, bushy      growth the following spring. The trouble with      <em>spring</em> planting is that you have to disbud the      young plants as flowers form and pinch back runners to      ensure vigorous growth (and worthwhile yields of fruit) the      following season. (This procedure isn't necessary in the      case of fall-planted strawberries.)    </p>    <p>      When choosing strawberry varieties from a catalog or at a      garden store, don't be fooled into buying so-called      "everbearing" varieties . . . stick with the June-bearing      types every time. Breeders have spent a lot of time and      effort trying to improve everbearing strawberries, but the      sad fact is that there still isn't an everbearer on the      market that'll give worthwhile yields. (Standard varieties      crop all in one two-or three-week period, but-even      so-they out-bear the everbearers easily.)    </p>    <p>      In order to enjoy a longer cropping season, it's a good      idea to plant at least two varieties (one early, one late)      of this delicious fruit. Your agricultural extension      service (check the county listing in the White Pages) can      provide you with a list of recommended varieties for your      locality. In my experience-and I've grown and      inspected many different crops-the following      varieties can nearly always be counted on:    </p>    <p>      <em>Fairfax</em> -an early ripener-produces      extremely soft, dark red berries that-although      unsuitable for freezing-are superb when it comes to      fresh-off-the-runner eating.    </p>    <p>      <em>Guardian</em> is a newly developed midseason variety      that offers unusually good disease resistance and yields      large, tasty, bright red berries.    </p>    <p>      <em>Premier</em> (early), <em>Midway</em> (mid-season), and      Sparkle (late) are other widely available varieties and      they produce large crops of delicious berries that are      suitable for freezing.    </p>    <p>      One unusual domesticated variety that closely matches the      wild strawberry in appearance and flavor is the alpine      strawberry, Baron Solemacher. <em>Baron Solemacher</em>      plants cover themselves with beautiful white flowers, and      because this variety is so decorative, you'll often find it      listed in the flower-not the fruit-section of      seed catalogs. And, since it doesn't set runners, this      alpine strawberry must be grown from seed that is started      indoors ten weeks ahead of outdoor planting time. The seed      is tiny (and germination sometimes erratic) but a fine crop      of berries-fully twice the size of wild      strawberries-can be grown the first year. Just      remember that the seed <em>requires light to      germinate:</em> Press the tiny grains into the soil's      surface and keep the area moist and well lit.    </p>    <p>      I've seen many ingenious ways to grow strawberries      (including the "strawberry barrel" . . see the "May-June      Almanac" foldout in MOTHER NO. 45), but the easiest method      I know is one in which plants are simply grown all over the      top of a low mound of compost-enriched soil in an odd      corner of the garden. (Having grown strawberries in      regimental straight lines for many years-and having      worked hard to keep those lines straight-I was      delighted to discover the "mound method", which is so      productive and yet so easy on the back!)    </p>    <p>      Regardless of how you arrange your plants, remember that      strawberries love soils that are loaded with organic      matter. Well-rotted manure, garden compost, and leaf mold      are all highly beneficial to the berries, even if you also      feed them with a general-purpose fertilizer.    </p>        <p>      Remember, too, not to set your plants too deeply (see Fig.      1), and try not to allow weeds to invade your strawberry      patch. (It helps to keep the soil around the plants loose      and open, and to apply a mulch.) Also, make sure your      plants get plenty of sun.    </p>    <p>      Properly cared for, your strawberry mound (or barrel, as      the case may be) should supply you with juicy, tart,      vitamin-C-rich fruit for three or four years, or longer.    </p>    <h3>      BACKYARD RASPBERRIES    </h3>    <p>      Raspberries come in several colors-red, black,      purple, and yellow-but of the four main types, the      red raspberry commands my loyalty for its tangy, fruity      flavor and its productiveness. (Note: 1 don't know why,      especially since yellow and red raspberries seem      compatible, but black and red varieties don't grow well in      each other's presence.)    </p>    <p>      When selecting raspberries from nurseries and catalogs,      you'll find some described as "summer-bearing", others      listed as "fall-bearing", and still others called      "everbearing". The term "everbearing", however, is a little      misleading when applied to raspberries, since it's used to      describe a plant that crops at two distinct times: once in      early summer, and again in the fall. Of the new      everbearers, a variety known as <em>Heritage</em> is      particularly noteworthy for its ability to produce a      moderate crop of large, red berries on old canes in the      summer, then a heavier yield on new canes in the fall.    </p>    <p>      As with all types of "bramble fruit", raspberries are best      planted in the fall. When you receive your rootstocks from      the nursery (see the sidebar at the end of this article for      a list of suppliers), set them in fertile earth that's been      enriched with garden compost, leaf mold, or well-rotted      manure, and keep the soil thoroughly cultivated for the      first few months after the planting.    </p>        <p>      You'll find that raspberries produce many "suckers" (that      is, new canes arising from the base of the parent plant). A      certain number of these are necessary for the plant's      proper development, but for maximum yields it's      advisable-every fall, after the cropping season has      ended-to prune all but six or eight canes (per plant)      to within an inch of the soil line. (Those canes that you      do leave should be trimmed back to 30" in height. See Fig.      2.)    </p>    <h3>      BLACKBERRIES: BETTER "TAMED" THAN WILD!    </h3>    <p>      Because wild blackberries are so abundant, many gardeners      pass up the opportunity to raise the domesticated kinds . .      . which is a pity, since "tamed" blackberry plants offer so      many advantages over their wild counterparts. Cultivated      varieties not only produce heavier crops of fruit, but bear      larger, juicier berries . . . berries that-in my      judgment-retain more flavor after freezing than      almost any other kind of fruit. With the advent of      thornless blackberry plants and dwarf varieties (such as      Darrow) that require much less care than full-size      varieties, there's no longer any excuse for not raising      blackberries in your back yard!    </p>    <p>      Blackberries will thrive in many types of soil, but do best      in moderately light loam to which humus has been added. (A      slightly acid soil-about pH 6.0-is desirable.)      If the plants are to be trained to a trellis, set them six      feet apart . . . otherwise, give them three- to four-foot      spacing.    </p>    <p>      When the canes reach a height of three or four feet, their      tops should be clipped to encourage the appearance of      "laterals", or side branches. Then-each fall, after      harvest-the canes that bore fruit that year should be      cut off at ground level and new canes (no more than ten per      plant) allowed to develop. When the new canes reach three      feet in height, they-in turn-can be clipped to      encourage the production of laterals. (And, after      <em>these</em> shoots have borne fruit, they should be cut      off at ground level, and so on.)    </p>    <h3>      LOGANBERRIES AND BOYSENBERRIES    </h3>    <p>      Both of these bramble fruits are blackberry hybrids, which      accounts not only for their blackberry-like flavor but for      the fact that their cultural requirements are the same as      the blackberry's. (As with all cane fruits, it's a good      idea to apply plenty of compost to loganberry and      boysenberry plantings each year between spring and fall.      For maximum productivity, you also may wish to rake a      general-purpose commercial fertilizer into the surface of      the earth around the canes in early spring. And as always,      keep the berry patch's soil weed-free.)    </p>    <h3>A FEW WORDS ABOUT BLUEBERRIES</h3>    <p>      Most berries do better when they're "companion planted"      with others of their own kind. This is especially      true-however-of blueberries, which are largely      self-sterile. In other words, to ensure high productivity      it's essential that you plant more than one variety of      blueberry. (Currently, the three most popular varieties are      <em>Earliblue, Bluecrop</em> , and <em>Coville</em> , which      are-respectively-early-, mid-season-, and      late-cropping.)    </p>    <p>      It's also important to bear in mind that blueberries      require a highly acid soil (pH 4 to 5). If the dirt in your      garden is neutral or alkaline, plan on working a good      quantity of pine needles, acid peat, wood chips, and/or      other acidic materials into the ground six months to a year      before you set out your blueberries.    </p>        <p>      At the time of planting (which is to say late fall in      California, late winter in warm southern areas, and early      spring elsewhere), the uppermost "twiggy" branches of each      blueberry bush should be pruned back (this will encourage      its roots to develop more rapidly). Pruning will be needed      again after about three years of growth as the plants      become densely thicketed with twigs and side branches.      (Simply cut away all small branches in the lower region of      the bush and clip off a number of side branches from the      main growing stems to "open up" the plant and let it      breathe.) After this third-year pruning, thin your      blueberry bushes of unneeded woody growth on a yearly basis      (see Fig. 3). This heavy pruning will stimulate new growth      and encourage the early formation of larger-than-normal      berries.    </p>    <p>      As you've probably guessed, blueberries-because of      their bushy, shrub-like growth habit-make excellent      hedges.    </p>    <h3>GRAPES FOR<br />      THE HOME GARDEN</h3>    <p>      Because there are so many varieties of grapes (well over a      hundred altogether)-each one of which is adapted to a      given climate and type of soil-it's virtually      impossible for me to recommend any one or two or three      varieties in particular as being "right" for everyone.      (Especially since the varieties that are best for eating      are usually unsuitable for winemaking, and vice versa.)    </p>    <p>      My own personal favorite for eating purposes is a white      grape called Cayuga. The rootstocks of this variety give      rise to exceedingly productive vines that bear large,      thickly set bunches of grapes . . . grapes that are      indescribably sweet. For <em>purple</em> grapes, it's hard      to beat the tried-and-true Concord. (My all-time favorite      grape product, in fact, is a pie made from the dusky,      blackishblue fruits of this variety.)    </p>    <p>      There are almost as many ways to plant and train grapes as      there are apples in the state of Washington, and each      method has its advantages and drawbacks. The      <em>easiest</em> way I know to get the job done, however,      is the Kniffin four-cane system, which goes as follows:    </p>        <p>      First, work plenty of organic matter (compost, rotted      manure, or what have you) into the soil. Then drive sturdy      poles into the ground about twenty feet apart and run No. 9      or No. 10 gauge galvanized wire between them (as shown in      Fig. 4) so that one wire is six feet and a second is      approximately three feet above the ground. Plant rootstocks      eight feet apart along the length of this "fence".    </p>    <p>      As large side shoots begin to grow, prune away all but two      branches from each trunk and train these two "arms" along      the lowest-to-the-ground wire in opposite directions (Fig.      4). Then-at the end of the first season (i.e., in      late fall)-prune the arms of the old vines and allow      a second pair of main branches to develop over the first      pair. Thereafter, prune the vines severely back to the four      main arms each fall.    </p>    <p>      You can expect a good crop of grapes the second season      after planting . . . and every year after that for at least      a generation.    </p>   <h3> OTHER BERRIES</h3>    <p>      So far, I haven't even begun to talk about some of the      other, more "exotic" domesticated berries-such as      lingon-berries, currants, gooseberries, etc.-that      home gardeners can (and should) grow in their back yards.      Nor have I (for space reasons) talked about the joys of      foraging wild berries . . . although-as I mentioned      earlier-I'm so hooked on these fruits that I find it      necessary to both grow and forage them.    </p>    <p>      I don't know which is more pleasurable . . . harvesting      nature's bounty from the wild, or cultivating your own      berries and grapes. I do know this though: Enjoying the      best of both worlds is certainly a satisfying-and      healthful-way to live . . . one I wholeheartedly      recommend.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Where to obtain the fruit varietie's mentioned      in this article</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>STRAWBERRIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fairfax Brittingham, Burpee    </p>    <p>      Guardian Brittingham, Burpee, Emlong    </p>    <p>      Midway Brittingham, Burpee, Emlong    </p>    <p>      Premier Brittingham, Burpee    </p>    <p>      Sparkle Brittingham, Burpee    </p>    <p>      Baron<br />      Solemacher Brittingham, Burpee Burpee    </p>    <p>      <strong>RASPBERRIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Heritage Burpee, Emlong    </p>    <p>      <strong>BLACKBERRIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Thornfree Brittingham, Burpee, Emlong    </p>    <p>      Darrow Burpee, Emlong    </p>    <p>      <strong>BLUEBERRIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Bluecrop Brittingham, Burpee, Emlong    </p>    <p>      Coville Brittingham, Burpee    </p>    <p>      Earliblue Brittingham, Burpee    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRAPES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Concord Brittingham, Burpee, Emlong    </p>    <p>      Cayuga NYSFTCA    </p>    <p>      Brittingham Plant Farms<br />      Ocean City Rd.<br />      Salisbury, Md. 21801<br />      <br />      W.
