                        <p>This page contains excerpts from issues of <em>THE COUNTRY      GENTLEMAN</em> dated 1915.</p>     <h3> Round The Farm</h3>       <h3> Potatoes for Poultry</h3>        <p>      WHEN properly handled potatoes make an excellent feed for      poultry. They may be fed after being thoroughly cooked, but      should never be given raw. If given in a crash of ground      grains the proportion should not exceed fifteen or twenty      per cent of the complete mixture. As the cooked product is      quite similar to corn meal in feeding value, such feeds as      bran, middlings, ground oats and meat feeds should be fed      in connection with them. After young chicks are weaned they      may be given cooked potatoes in the same proportion as has      been suggested for the mature fowls. C. L. O.    </p>   <h3>An Economical Barn</h3>        <p>      TIME was when barn-building materials could be had for the      cutting or the hauling. But the present increasingly high      prices of lumber have forced barn builders to economize      wherever it is possible within the limits of safety.<br />    </p>    <p>      The plank frame barn design shown herewith makes every      stick of lumber do its share of the work. The Iowa      Experiment Station is striving to help Iowa farmers not      only- to solve their problems about livestock and field      crops, but to build better barns at the lowest possible      cost and to plan them for the greatest efficiency.    </p>        <p>      This barn-framing plan has met great favor among harn      builders. There are no heavy and long timbers in its      design. The rafter, are of two-by-six-inch material and the      wall studding is of the same size. The joists are      two-by-twelves, supported by heavy built-up girders at the      center. The roof arches, the wall studding and the joists      are all securely tied together and well braced to overcome      every possible pressure. The rafters, studding and joists      are all placed two feet center to center throughout the      length of the barn.    </p>    <p>      In Iowa a number of barns of this type have been      constructed. An estimate shows that they cost about a      dollar a square foot of floor space.    </p>    <p>      W. E. F.    </p>    <h3>The R.F.D. Letter Box</h3>    <h3>Feed for Finishing Steers</h3>    <p>      <em>Is any one of the following combinations a sufficient      ration for fattening beef: First, corn and soy beans and      shredded corn fodder; second, corn and cow peas and      shredded corn fodder; third, corn and a mixture of soy      beans and cowpeas and shredded corn fodder?</em>    </p>    <p>      B. P., Ohio.    </p>    <p>      ANY one of the rations listed might be sufficient to finish      steers, but whether the gains would be profitable or not is      a different question. If used, the corn and beans or peas      should be fed in the proportions of about four to one. The      absence of any succulent material in the feeds is serious,      while the presence of corn and corn fodder in any      considerable amount argues the need for a silo on the      farm.<br />    </p>    <p>      Soy beans or cowpeas, or both, will make a fairly      satisfactory substitute for cottonseed meal in steer      feeding, and are fed in about the same amounts. If      identical in price cottonseed meal might make gains      somewhat more economically. There has been little      experimental feeding of cowpeas to steers, because the      yield is small in the Middle West; the peas ripen      irregularly, and the price is high. When grown for feed in      that section they are commonly used as forage.    </p>    <p>      Soy beans are heavier yielders and have been fed to steers      with fairly satisfactory results. They seem to be      especially good for short feeding periods, but after three      months or more steers consuming them may lose their      keenness of appetite, and gains will decline slightly.      Probably because of the very high fat content, soy-bean-fed      cattle have lacked firmness of flesh, resulting in a slight      reduction in selling price.    </p>    <p>      With silage at hand a daily ration more satisfactory than      any of those given and about as profitable as any to be had      would be shelled corn twelve to fifteen pounds, corn silage      twenty to twenty-five pounds, soy-bean meal two and a half      to three pounds, and some shredded corn stover in addition.    </p>    <p>      G. G.    </p>    <h3>Grasses for Bottom Land</h3>    <p>      <em>I have some river-bottom, white, sandy land that is      very loose. It produces cotton well but not corn, as worms      eat the roots. Will this land produce alfalfa, and if not,      what is the best grass for it? The soil stands drought      ,well and cart kick up moisture any time.</em>    </p>    <p>      J. H. D., Ark.    </p>        <p>      IF YOUR land does not overflow so water would cover the      crop for more than twenty-four hours, I see no reason why      you should not grow alfalfa profitably. It is more      difficult to get a stand, of course, where the soil is so      loose, but once started the alfalfa plants will bind the      soil more closely together. Such land should be sown in the      fall, when there is a minimum amount of wind and also when      there is sufficient moisture in the soil not only to      germinate the seed but also to support the young plants      until more rain falls. Do not plant the seed too deep in      such loose soil, as the plants will have difficulty in      getting through. Better try out a small acreage before      going into the crop on a large scale.    </p>    <p>      Sudan grass should make a big yield of bay on your land and      is worthy of a thorough trial in your section. Bermuda or      Kentucky blue grass will be your best pasture grass.    </p>    <p>      C. E. H.    </p>   <h3> Pickling and Preserving</h3>       <h3>Candied Apricots</h3>    <p>      FOUR pounds of apricots, four cupfuls of sugar and four      cupfuls of water. Drop the apricots, which must be large      and perfect, in boiling water and cook for ten minutes,      then drain thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      Make a sirup with the sugar and water, and when it forms a      soft ball when tried in water put in the apricots. Remove      from the tire, turn the fruit occasionally and let it stand      overnight in a slow oven. Repeat this operation four times,      each time skimming out the fruit and letting the sirup just      come to a boil. The fifth time make a new sirup, as in the      first place, and when it boils and stands the test put in      the fruit.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the sirup is cool dip out the fruit and place it      in a pan to harden and candy, keeping it at a temperature      of sixty-five degrees. When candied place in boxes between      layers of waxed paper.    </p>   <h3> Pickled Chokecherries</h3>    <p>      Bring to the boiling point a pint and a half of vinegar      into which have been stirred half a cupful of brown sugar,      a tablespoonful of whole cloves and a dozen blades of mace.      Boil all together for five minutes, and set aside to cool.      Have ready three quarts of chokecherries and put them into      glass jars. Strain the spices from the cold vinegar, and      pour the latter over the fruit, filling the jars to the      brim. Seal at once.    </p>   <h3>Citron Melon Preserve</h3>    <p>      Cut the melon in small pieces about two inches thick and      remove skin and seeds. Weigh and measure the pieces. For      four quarts take a scant half-cupful of salt and sprinkle      it over the melon; pour on cold water to cover and let      stand twenty-four hours. Drain thoroughly and boil in fresh      water for about half an hour, changing the water if needed      to remove salt.    </p>    <p>      Drain again, and to each pound of fruit add three-quarters      of a pound of sugar and one lemon thinly sliced. Again      cover with enough water to dissolve the sugar and simmer      until transparent and tender.    </p>    <h3>Quince and Papaw Preserve</h3>    <p>      Eighteen quinces, papaws and sugar.    </p>    <p>      Peel, quarter and core the quinces. Weigh and put them into      a preserving pan, cover with water and cook slowly until      tender. Take the same weight of papaws, which have been      peeled and cut into pieces about the same size as the      quince quarters. Scald well and drain. Add to the quinces      their weight in sugar, the well-drained papaws and the      juice of the skins and the cores of the quinces, which have      been well cooked in water and strained. Cook slowly until      thick. Seal in jars.    </p>
