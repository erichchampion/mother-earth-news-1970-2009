                      <p>      <strong>CON ED LOSES WINDPLANT BATTLE.</strong> In a      landmark ruling, the New York Public Service Commission      last May ordered Consolidated Edison-which had said      it would not buy the excess electricity produced by a      2-kilowatt wind generator mounted atop a tenement building      at 519 E. 11th St. in New York City-to purchase the      surplus wattage anyway. Now-thanks to this      ruling-any Con Ed customer who wants to install a      windplant on his/her property may do so legally . . .      and-if the installation includes a device (such as      the Gemini Synchronous Inverter) that can feed excess      "juice" back into the utility lines-Con Ed must buy      the customer-produced electricity at the rate of 2.3d per      kilowatt-hour.    </p>    <p>      <strong>U.S. ENERGY CONSUMPTION WILL RISE 6% IN      1977</strong> (well above past rates of increase),      according to latest Institute of Gas Technology      predictions. IGT-whose projections have been accurate      in the past-further predicts that this year, for the      first time, more than 50% of the total petroleum used in      the U.S. will be of foreign origin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLORADO WINS SERI.</strong> After months of      delays, the U.S. Energy Research and Development      Administration has selected Golden, Colorado (just outside      Denver) as the site of the coveted Solar Energy Research      Institute. SERI-with an initial staff of 75      professionals and a first-year budget of $4 to $6      million-will function in concert with universities,      corporations, and other federal, state, and local      government agencies to coordinate domestic solar energy      research.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT MAY BE THE LARGEST DARRIEUS ROTOR IN THE      COUNTRY</strong> is now in operation at the Energy Research      and Development Administration's Sandia Laboratories      facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The machine-a      vertical-axis wind turbine with eggbeater-like      blades-stands seven stories tall and has a rotor      diameter of 55 feet. Peak power output (in a 28-mph wind)      is said to be 60 kilowatts . . . enough electricity to      power about 30 homes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"WE ARE NOT RUNNING OUT OF ENERGY.</strong> But we      are running out of cheap oil and gas . . . . We are running      out of the environmental capacity needed to handle the      pollutants generated in conventional energy production. And      we are running out of time to adjust to these new      realities." So says Denis Hayes in <strong>Energy: The      Solar Prospect,</strong> the 11th in a series of incisive      monographs published by the Worldwatch Institute. To get      your copy of this handsomely produced, richly informative      80-page book, send $2.00 to: Worldwatch Institute, 1776      Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ELECTRIC MASTER-METERING OF APARTMENT      BUILDINGS</strong> wastes 7 billion kilowatt-hours of      electricity per year, according to a recent study by the      Midwest Research Institute of Kansas City, Missouri. The      lack of feedback in the form of an individual electric      bill-the study says-causes residents of      master-metered buildings to develop poor energy-use habits      . . . habits that lead to the use of 35% more electricity      (on the average) than normal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NAZI COAL CONVERSION METHODS UNDER REVIEW.</strong>      Texas A & M University professor Arnold Krammer says      he'll be spending the next couple of years looking for      hitherto unknown coal-to-oil conversion methods in roughly      one million pages of captured Nazi documents now on file at      the National Archives. (The papers were obtained by Allied      forces in a sweep of German oil companies at the end of      World War II.) A futile undertaking? Dow Chemical, General      Motors, Union Carbide, Diamond Shamrock, and Texas      Utilities don't think so . . . they've donated $289,000 to      the project.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONSERVATION AND SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES WILL PROVIDE      FULL EMPLOYMENT</strong> at less cost (and with less      degradation of the environment) than continued expenditures      on large-scale, centralized energy sources. That's the      bottom line from Jobs and Energy, a comprehensive review of      the employment impact of alternative energy technologies,      just released by Environmentalists For Full Employment. You      can obtain your own copy of EFFE's 21-page report by      sending $2.00/copy ($5.00/copy for institutions) to      Environmentalists For Full Employment, 1785 Massachusetts      Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAFIA EYES ENERGY SCENE.</strong> Kentucky      Securities Director Jack Bunnell reports that authorities      in his state have uncovered attempts by underworld figures      to acquire coal companies and/or coal leases in Kentucky,      Alabama, Pennsylvania, and the Virginias. According to      Bunnell, the organized crime operations surfaced only      recently because of the cold winter . . . . Sweden's      Professor Goesta Wranglen-president of the      International Society of Electro-Chemistry-warns that      there's only <strong>ONE WAY TO BURY NUCLEAR WASTES      SAFELY,</strong> and that's to encapsulate them in gold.      Only gold, says Wranglen, can withstand radiolysis (the      corrosive effect of the "hot" water that surrounds the      wastes) for thousands of years . . . . Got an      energy-related invention you'd like the government to help      you develop? The first step is to fill out an evaluation      request form, which you can obtain from the <strong>OFFICE      OF ENERGY-RELATED INVENTIONS,</strong> National Bureau of      Standards, Washington, D.C. 20545. NBS will evaluate your      invention free of charge and put you onto sources of      funding if they think it's good . . . . <strong>MORE THAN      1,000 DEMONSTRATORS WERE ARRESTED</strong> following an      April 30 protest gathering at the Seabrook, New Hampshire      nuclear power plant construction site. Although the      gathering was peaceful, Governor Meldrim Thompson told      protestors they were "trespassing" . . . . The Housing and      Urban Development Department's <strong>TOLL-FREE SOLAR      HOTLINE</strong> (see Energy Flashes, MOTHER N0. 44) rang a      record 3,215 times during the last week of April. As a      result, the folks at HUD's National Solar Heating and      Cooling Information Center now request that      information-seekers write-not call-them at P.O.      Box 1607, Rockville, Md. 20850.    </p>
