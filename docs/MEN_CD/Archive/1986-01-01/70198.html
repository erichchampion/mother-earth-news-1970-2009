                    <h5 id="byline">      by Mary Alice Krebs    </h5>    <p>      <em>A delight to the palate, the shiitake      (pronounced she-ee-tah-key)      mushroom can turn waste wood into      $20-a-pound produce.</em>    </p>        <p>      Its flavor has been likened to those of lobster and filet      mignon. It's low in calories, it's high in protein and B      vitamins, and it reduces serum cholesterol. The shiitake,      the savory Japanese forest mushroom, is a rising star of      the gourmet world. And for those with the requisite time      and patience, it can also be the core of a lucrative,      low-labor business.    </p>    <p>      <em>Shiitake</em> <em>(Lentinus edodes)</em> has been grown      commercially in Japan for centuries and is still one of      that country's major agricultural exports. But until 1972,      you couldn't cultivate the mushroom in this country; live      shiitake culture was banned in the United States. Because      shiitake is lignicolous-which means that it lives on      wood, drawing its nutrients from lignin and      cellulose-there was concern that the fungus could      spread beyond its areas of cultivation and attack railroad      ties and wooden structures. That theory proved false,      however, and now even the usually staid USDA predicts a      promising future for domestic shiitake farmers.    </p>    <p>      Some experts, in fact, expect the mushroom eventually to      supplant the more familiar button type at supermarkets.      Small-scale growers are already finding profitable markets      as more and more restaurants, co-ops, oriental food stores,      and farmers' markets clamor for the delicacy-and pay      anywhere from $4 to $20 (and sometimes more!) a pound.    </p>    <h3>      GETTING STARTED    </h3>    <p>      Shiitake mushrooms are traditionally grown outdoors on      seasoned hardwood logs-preferably oak, although      maple, birch, poplar, aspen, beech, and other species have      also been used successfully. Shiitake spawn won't do well      on live or green wood, however, nor is it likely to survive      on deadfall wood, or on stock contaminated by lichens or      other fungi. It's necessary, therefore, to cut logs for      shiitake cultivation from freshly felled trees or      justtrimmed limbs. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: See the sidebar</em>      <em>"Improving Your Woodlot with Shiitake. "]</em>    </p>    <p>      For the sake of manageability, the stock should measure      between three and six inches in diameter. Fell the trees in      late fall or winter, when they're leafless and when the      wood's sugar content is highest and most beneficial to      fungus growth. Then cut the logs into 40-inch lengths,      being careful to keep the bark intact-the bark is a      critical requirement for fruiting. It's important, too, to      get the wood up off the ground immediately, to avoid      contamination from other organisms. Any logs that appear to      be diseased or that have fungus growing on them should be      used only for firewood.    </p>    <p>      Stack the billets out of the sun and wind to cure, making      sure to leave spaces between the logs for air to circulate      freely-the crib stack method shown in the photo on      page 40 is an effective arrangement. A shady spot in the      woods under a stand of pines is an ideal place to season      logs; or, if necessary, you can create a suitable      environment by building (or planting) a windbreak and using      a tarpaulin for shade. If you live in an area where there      is much rainfall, you may need to keep a cover over the      wood. Snow, on the other hand, does no harm to the wood.    </p>    <p>      Now you can go back to your other chores for a while, since      the cut logs need to cure for 30 to 90 days, or until their      moisture content has dropped to 40 or 50%. Professional      foresters and shiitake cultivators use a special measuring      device to determine the moisture content of wood. You can      test your stock, though, by cutting about six inches off a      log, then cutting a one-inch slice from the new end. Weigh      the one-inch piece, then dry it in an oven at 120° for      about 48 hours. (To avoid tying up your oven for that long,      you can use a small toaster oven, or simply dry the slice      overnight for several nights in a row.) Weigh the wood      occasionally, and when it ceases to lose weight, subtract      the dry weight from the wet weight to find the weight of      water in the log. Then divide the weight of the water by      the original wet weight . . . multiply that figure by 100 .      . . and you'll have the percentage of moisture in the logs.    </p>    <h3>      INOCULATING THE LOGS    </h3>    <p>      When the moisture content has dropped to 40 or 50%, the      logs can be inoculated. This is usually done in early      spring. About six to eight weeks beforehand, order your      spawn plugs-short wooden dowels impregnated with      shiitake spawn (see the sidebar for a list of suppliers).      If you get the plugs before the wood is cured, just store      them in the refrigerator. You'll need at least 3,000 plugs      per cord of wood; if you want to grow only enough mushrooms      for your family, though, 300 or so-about 15 logs'      worth-should suffice. (Of course, the more plugs you      buy, the greater the savings. And if you can, buy tapered      plugs; they're much easier to use.)    </p>    <p>      You'll also need to gather together a few tools and      additional materials: cheese wax (available from      cheese-making supply companies; ordinary paraffin is an      acceptable, but less desirable, alternative), a double      boiler, a cooking thermometer, a hammer, a small      paintbrush, and a drill and 5/16" bit with a stop collar.    </p>    <p>      Ready? OK, find a shady area to work in, since direct      sunlight can damage the spawn. In each log to be      inoculated, bore a row of oneinch-deep holes spaced no more      than ten inches apart; then turn the log about two inches      and drill another row of holes parallel to the first but      with the cavities offset so that each is alongside the      space between holes in the adjacent row. Continue this      pattern around the log. (Some growers recommend that woods      of light density, such as aspen and birch, be cut to a      length of just three feet and the spawn plugs placed every      five inches.) Obviously, smallerdiameter logs will take      fewer plugs than larger ones.    </p>    <p>      Once the holes have been bored, it's important to introduce      the spawn immediately; if you drill your logs one day and      plug them the next, other organisms will have enough time      to contaminate the logs. Hammer the spawn plugs firmly into      the holes, flush with the wood, and then use a paintbrush      to apply a coating of melted wax over the plugs. (Melt the      wax in a double boiler, making sure that its temperature      remains under 212°F. Hotter wax will kill the spawn.)      Growers in dry, windy climates sometimes also wax one end      of each log, to help keep moisture in and contaminants out.    </p>    <h3>      NOW FOR THE HARD PART    </h3>    <p>      With the inoculation done, restack the logs in a      well-drained, shaded area. (At this stage, instead of using      the crib stack, many growers lean the logs at a 45°      angle against each side of a horizontal pole, A-frame      style, to provide more growing surface.) The logs will take      between one and two years to bear fruit. After your first      crop is harvested, however, you can count on additional      harvests every spring and fall for the next three to five      years. All good things are worth waiting for!    </p>    <p>      For now, you need only check your logs once a week or so      for contamination. If you see surface molds or other fungi,      try providing more air circulation around the logs to take      care of the problem. If you notice any logs that are      heavily contaminated with surface molds, that are losing      their bark, or that are producing other kinds of mushrooms,      remove them.    </p>    <p>      Another thing to watch out for is excessive drying. Turning      the logs occasionally (twice per growing season is usually      enough) helps to keep the logs' moisture evenly      distributed. If you live in an area where the humidity is      normally low in the summer months, a porous covering (such      as burlap) should be placed over the logs to help them      retain moisture. If it's an extremely dry summer, the logs'      moisture content may be in danger of dropping below 30%,      the minimum required for the fungus to live. If these      conditions occur, test the logs for water content again,      and if necessary, soak them. Just a hosing down isn't      enough. They should be soaked steadily with sprinklers or      in a tub or nearby stream for 24 hours.    </p>    <h3>      FUNGUS AT LAST    </h3>        <p>      Shiitake usually fruits in the spring and the fall. You may      be able to tell when fruiting is imminent by checking the      ends of the log for a white, fuzzy growth called mycelium;      if you see it, you know the spawn has permeated the log.      If, after 18 or more months from inoculation, you still      can't see any mycelium, cut a thin slice six inches in from      the end of a log and place it in a covered jar with a damp      cloth. This should force the mycelium to appear within a      couple of days.    </p>    <p>      Once the mycelium shows itself, you can relax a little,      because the chances of other organisms contaminating the      wood at this point are slim. On the other hand, you may      still be in for a wait before the mushrooms appear. Just be      patient and trust the power of time and nature. A heavy      rainfall-particularly one following a dry      period-can cause the permeated logs to begin      fruiting. If Mother Nature simply-refuses to do the work      for you, a good soaking will usually do the trick.    </p>    <p>      When the mushrooms do begin to form, you'll need to harvest      them daily during the fruiting stage, which usually lasts      about a week. Shiitake mushrooms emerge as rounded knobs;      as they grow, the brown, gilled caps gradually open and      flatten, becoming quite large (two to six inches in      diameter). The stems are thick and meaty. The best time to      pick a shiitake mushroom is just before the cap flattens      completely; simply pull the fungus off the log with a      twisting motion. (Shiitake mushrooms are easily      distinguishable from most wild mushrooms, but if you have      any doubt about the kind growing on your logs, by all means      check with someone who can make a positive identification      before you consume or distribute them!)    </p>    <p>      Fresh shiitake stores well for up to two weeks if kept      refrigerated in ventilated containers. However, for every      hour after the mushrooms are picked and not refrigerated,      they lose a day of shelf life-so you'll probably want      to refrigerate them quickly. On the other hand, if you need      to store some for longer than just a couple of weeks, or if      you want to hold a supply to wait for anticipated higher      market prices, they can easily be dried outdoors on a hot,      sunny day or in a commercial dehydrator. (Many people say      that the shiitake's flavor is enhanced when dried; to      rejuvenate dehydrated mushrooms for cooking, just soak them      in hot water for 15 to 30 minutes.)    </p>    <h3>      MUSHROOMING PROFITS    </h3>        <p>      The cost for shiitake spawn averages $30 to $45 per 1,000      plugs. A person who intends to cultivate the mushrooms on a      commercial scale (and who would probably qualify for a      quantity discount) can expect to spend about $200 on spawn      for each cord of wood used.    </p>    <p>      The return on that cord of wood after fruiting begins      should be at least $450 each year for the life of the logs,      or about three to five years. This is based on a      conservative market-price estimate of $4 per pound,      fresh weight. Markets vary locally, of course, so you'll      need to check the going rate in your locale for more      accurate earnings projections. Fresh shiitake generally      brings the highest prices-but I recently discovered a      co-op where dried shiitake was selling for $50 a pound!    </p>    <p>      As you can see, growing shiitake takes care and patience,      but you can successfully cultivate this delectable mushroom      and enjoy not only a delightful addition to your dinner      table, but an extra income as well. Next time you head out      to cut firewood, you just might find yourself eyeing those      logs from a different point of view!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Shiitake is grown in most parts of the      country-but not always outdoors. In particularly hot,      dry climates, and in regions where humidity and moisture      foster vast numbers of competing fungi; shiitake is usually      cultivated indoors, in a controlled environment, using      techniques other than the traditional one discussed here.      One such method was outlined in "A Fungus Fit for a King"      on page 87 of MOTHER NO. 65. Anothersaid to shorten the      time for spawn growth to as little as four months-is      detailed in "Shiitake Gardening and Farming, "available for      $3.00 postpaid from Mushroompeople (listed in the sidebar      "Sources for Shiitake Spawn').    </p>    <h3>      Improving Your Woodlot with Shiitake    </h3>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Sources for Shiitake Spawn    </h3>    <p>      All the firms listed below offer free catalogs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mushroompeople</strong><br />      P.O.

Joe Deden and Mitch      Gilbert, the center's resident foresters, view shiitake      cultivation as an excellent way for landowners to use the      smalldiameter, low-grade hardwood trees that should be      thinned out of a woodlot as a matter of good management.      "Families can develop small businesses with shiitake      mushrooms that can increase their income and improve their      woodlots too, " Deden says. He recommends that you consult      a forester for help !n choosing trees that will both      provide suitable shiitake logs and encourage better growth      of your woodlot by their removal.    </p>    <p>      So far, Deden and Gilbert have attempted to grow shiitake      on 16 different species of wood, using a variety of      techniques. In addition to practicing the traditional      Japanese method explained in this article, the foresters      have been experimenting with growing the mushroom yearround      indoors. They encourage anyone interested in shiitake      cultivation to come to the resource center to talk with      them and view their operation. "Growing shiitake is a      learn-as-you-go proposition, " says Deden. "We recommend      that people start small and then expand their operations as      they learn which techniques are best for their areas. "    </p>    <p>      In addition, the center offers an excellent      threetimes-a year publication, The Shiitake      Newsletter, for $25 a year. For further information on the      center-or for answers to questions about growing      shiitake-send a selfaddressed, stamped envelope to      the S. E. Minnesota Forest Resource Center, Rt. 2, Box      156A, Lanesboro, MN 55949.    </p>    <h3>      The Secret Life of a Mushroom    </h3>    <p>      Imagine a thriving vegetable garden in which there are no      leaves, no stems, no vines . . . only vegetables-some      small and rapidly growing, others plump and fully ripened,      still others just emerging-which have slowly come up      through the soil from plants beneath the ground.    </p>    <p>      That, in essence, is what you see when you happen across a      patch of mushrooms in a meadow or forest.    </p>    <p>      A mushroom is only the visible part-the fruitof a fungus      plant. The vegetative portion, called the mycelium, grows      underground or (as in the case of shiitake) within an      organic host, or substrate, such as wood. Wild mushrooms      develop from microscopic seed called spores, while      commercial growers usually propagate their mushrooms using      spawn: small colonies of mycelia-seedlings, in      effect-that have been started in a medium suitable to      the species being raised. The spawn, in turn, is then      transplanted to the substrate, where the mycelium can      spread, mature, and eventually send fruit above ground.    </p>    <p>      The exact conditions that prompt fruiting are yet to be      fully understood, in part because the requirements vary      greatly by species (and there are roughly 10,000 mushroom      species in North America alone!). Some varieties fruit in      response to alternating periods of wet and dry and/or cold      and warm, while others require a sustained climate, often      one that's quite humid. Many mushrooms require shade, while      others thrive in sunlight (there are several types, in      fact, that grow only in desert areas). Some species of      mushrooms emerge, ripen, release their spores, and rot      within a matter of hours . . . yet othersparticularly      lignicolous varieties such as shiitake-can take years to      emerge and, once they do, can grow and develop for weeks or      even months before completing their life cycle.    </p>
