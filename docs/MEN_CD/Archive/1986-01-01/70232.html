    <p>
                        <p>      Lead. It's a word you'll probably be hearing a lot over the      next few years, because the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) has launched a major campaign to ban its use in all      gasoline motor fuels. But before that federal agency is      successful in its effort, you might want to be aware of      some facts that could affect you more directly than you      might think.    </p>    <p>      Technically speaking, the "lead" in question is actually      tetraethyl lead (TEL), a tox ic, oily compound developed in      1922 as an antiknock additive. At that time, before      petroleum refining processes were perfected, the addition      of lead increased gasoline's octane rating-its      measure of resistance to harmful detonation-from      somewhere around 50 to about 75. Modern gasoline, prior to      the introduction of lead, has an average octane number in      the mid-80s; adding just a teaspoonful of TEL to every      gallon raises that figure by about six points, enough to      satisfy the needs of nearly all automobile engines.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the unchecked use of lead in motor fuel has      taken its toll. In part, the steady development of      efficient, high-compression engines in the two decades from      the early 1950s to 1970 reflected the proportional increase      in the amount of TEL used during that period. More      significantly, the explosive growth in the world's use of      automobiles since World War II from just over 50 million      vehicles in 1950 to well over 300 million today-has      played a major role in the poisoning of our environment.    </p>    <p>      The fact that high levels of lead contamination have an      adverse effect on human health has never been questioned.      But more recent evidence suggests that levels of lead      concentration in the blood lower than that previously      thought dangerous may have some effects as well.      Additionally, studies conducted by the EPA and several      other institutions show a direct correlation between the      total amount of lead used in gasoline and the blood-lead      levels of both children and adults.    </p>    <p>      <strong>I</strong>n her time she must have been an eyeful.      Two-tone paint like a picture postcard from paradise. Just      the right amount of chrome in just the right places. And an      interior you could set up housekeeping in and not mind at      all.    </p>    <p>      You get the picture. A dreamboat.    </p>    <p>      But that was before.    </p>    <p>      Not tonight. Tonight she sat motionless on the shoulder and      didn't notice the rain doing a soft-shoe on her ragtop. She      didn't care that her owner sat sobbing quietly in her      Naugahyde lap. She didn't even mind that her hood was      lifted to reveal the steaming, dripping, smoking hunk of      junk that used to be her heart. Tonight you could sum up      how she looked in a single word.    </p>    <p>      Dead.    </p>    <p>      Lead exposure is measured in micrograms per deciliter of      blood (pg/dl); the CDC recently lowered its definition of      lead toxicity from a blood-lead level of 30 µg/dl to      one of 25 µg/dl. Even so, a number of effects have      been -detected at blood-lead levels as low as 10 to 15      µg/dl. These include a restriction in the synthesis      of heme (an element critical to the formation of hemoglobin      and certain detoxifying liver enzymes), a change in      brainwave patterns, and an inhibition of vitamin D      metabolism (which is necessary to the normal growth and      development of children).    </p>    <p>      Equally incriminating is the relationship between lead use      in fuel and lead concentration in humans: Between 1976 and      1980, the amount of TEL used in gasoline production dropped      from just over 100 thousand tons per six months to a low of      about 48 thousand tons per half-year. In that four-year      period, average bloodlead levels declined at a similar      rate, from 16 µg/dl to 9.6; more significantly, the      trends followed each other closely and even matched      seasonal fluctuations. Currently, the EPA maintains that      leaded gasoline is responsible for 80% to 90% of all      airborne lead emissions. If that figure is accurate, motor      fuel accounts for over half a child's, and about one-third      of an adult's, "baseline" exposure to lead . . . a term      used to indicate the level encountered in a typical rural      area, removed from the urban sources of lead pollution.    </p>    <h3>      EPA TO THE RESCUE?    </h3>    <p>      Recognizing the problem of lead in our environment, the      EPA, in December of 1973, proposed a five-step lead      phasedown program that would have limited the use of TEL to      0.5 grams per total gallon by January of 1979, down from      the then-current average of 2.5 grams per gallon. The      agency actually sowed the seeds of change as early as 1970      in an effort to prepare both the petroleum industry and the      automobile manufacturers for the eventual switch to      unleaded fuels.    </p>    <p>      The record shows that the lead reduction program has indeed      reduced harmful emissions . . . but it's been an uphill      battle, and it's far from over. No sooner was the program      under way than it received a setback from the energy crisis      of the mid-1970s; since the petroleum industry uses TEL to      coax a greater volume of highoctane gasoline from each      barrel of oil, the EPA rulings were seen as a significant      kink in the hose of progress. To compound the problem, a      number of small refineries that dealt mainly in the      production of leaded fuels-in concert with the Ethyl      Corporation, the leading supplier of tetraethyl      lead-petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals to review the      phasedown regulations.    </p>    <p>      Ultimately, the EPA extended the 1979 deadline, in part, to      1982. Early that same year, the agency also considered      relaxing some of the limits on lead in gasoline . . . but      stiff opposition from environmentalists and medical experts      prompted it to propose even more stringent standards, which      culminated in the March 1985 decision to limit the use of      lead in gasoline to 0.50 grams per leaded gallon (gp/g) by      July of the same year and to reduce it further to 0.10 gplg      by January 1, 1986. In addition, a Notice of Proposed      Rulemaking was issued soliciting comments on a to taliban      of lead in gasoline by 1988.    </p>    <p>      Why the sudden reversal in direction? Obviously, public      health is a major concern. But there exist some other      factors that might not be so apparent. For one, the EPA had      counted on a much higher attrition rate among pre-1975      leaded-fuel cars than actually came to pass. Steep new-car      prices, recession, unemployment, and the additional      at-the-pump cost of unleaded fuel have encouraged many auto      owners to hang on to their older models, which incidentally      are generally more simple and less expensive to service      than new cars. The sad truth is that the EPA      numbercrunchers predicted refinery lead usage in the      neighborhood of 21 billion grams by 1988 . . . but recently      had to revise their estimates upward by 67% to almost 38      billion grams, to bring the figures in line with the facts.      Even with yesterday's egg on its face, the agency continues      to maintain that by 1988 over 95% of all automobiles on the      road will be those designed to use unleaded fuel.    </p>    <p>      Another closely related factor is the unprecedented      incidence of fuel switching and emissions-control tampering      on the part of vehicle owners. According to EPA figures,      16% of all unleaded-fuel cars are being operated on leaded      gasoline. Furthermore, an estimated 28% have had a major      emission-control component altered or removed.    </p>    <p>      The agency's concern, of course, stems from the fact that      the platinum-palladium catalysts used in the exhaust      systems of 1975 and-newer automobiles to transform the bulk      of harmful emissions into inert gases will be rendered      ineffective if forced to handle several tankfuls of leaded      fuel. No federal law prohibits private individuals from      switching motor fuels, and the 40 states that do have such      regulations find them nearly impossible to enforce. To add      insult to injury, some of the perpetrators of the crime      could well be among those enlisted to prevent it: Not too      long ago, the Philadelphia police force was fined $300,000      for tampering with its fleet's emis sion-control equipment      and tanking up with leaded fuel.    </p>    <h3>      AN "A" FOR EFFORT    </h3>    <p>      Few could deny the EPA's noble effort to reduce airborne      lead contamination . . . but that may be only because there      are a couple of stones left unturned. Earlier, it was noted      that the development of tetraethyl lead paved the way for      the introduction of high-octane fuels. Subsequently,      engineers took advantage of the potent blend to develop      powerplants that were successively lighter in weight and      more efficient, and which utilized high-compression,      advanced-combustion chamber design and improvements in      metallurgy to squeeze an unprecedented amount of power from      a gallon of gasoline.    </p>    <p>      Lead, you'll remember, is the ultimate antiknock compound.      But it also happens to be the best valve-seat lubricant      around. An engine operated at even moderate highway speeds      is subjected to severe valve-component stress. At high RPM,      the exhaust valves are being hurled against their cast-iron      seats at a rate of several hundred times per minute, in an      environment of tremendous temperature. With insufficient      quantities of lead in the fuel, the two surfaces become      microscopically and instantaneously welded together, only      to be torn apart just as rapidly. Eventually-in as      few as several thousand miles of freeway driving-the      weaker valve seat deteriorates and recedes to the point      where it provides an ineffective seal, resulting in loss of      compression, degraded performance, andironically-increased      hydrocarbon emissions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>B</strong>y the time I showed up, O'Malley was there, leaning      against the guardrail looking completely and utterly bored      as he tossed a blackened chunk of metal into the air.    </p>    <p>      "That what did her in?" I asked, nodding at his plaything.    </p>    <p>      "Yep." He let it fall into his palm and pitched it to me.    </p>    <p>      I turned it over in my hand and gave it a quick once-over.      A valve, charred and burned blacker than one of Fat Eddie's      Biggie Burgers (two for a quarter).    </p>    <p>      "Any suspects?"    </p>    <p>      "Sure we got a suspect. You think we show up at the station      just to catch up on our sleep?"    </p>    <p>      I let that one pass. Too easy. "Care to let me in on it?"    </p>    <p>      "Sorry, shamus. Not a prayer."    </p>    <p>      "OK. So don't give me a name. I'll settle for a little      hint."    </p>    <p>      He took his sweet time relighting what used to be a cigar.      "I feel sorry for you," he said. "I know you've got one      just like her in your driveway. How about initials?"    </p>    <p>      "Sold. Give." I felt like a dog yapping after table scraps.    </p>    <p>      "EPA mean anything to you?"    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, the auto industry read the handwriting on the      wall early on. Beginning in 1971, most GM vehicles were      factory-equipped with induction-hardened valve seats; by      1975, essentially all cars and light trucks were made to      use unleaded fuel with no ill effects.    </p>    <p>      On paper, this has all the markings of a success story. A      decade has passed since auto manufacturers converted their      products to burn lead-free fuel, so we can assume that the      great majority of drivers operate catalyst-equipped      cars. Or can we? Let's look at some figures. Statistics      indicate that there are over 150 million automobiles in use      in the United States today. Conservative estimates place      about 10% of those in the pre-1972 model year,      must-have-lead category. But even the EPA admits that, as      you read this, there might be nearly 21 million vehicles on      the road that require some amount of lead in their fuel . .      . and other sources place the number as high as 50 million!    </p>    <p>      Where the source of this discrepancy lies is difficult to      pinpoint, and perhaps can be traced to registered vehicles      which aren't in use, a hidden population of antique and      classic automobiles, or the inclusion of nonautomotive      vehicles. But one thing is certain: The potential for      economic hardship that could be inflicted upon the owners      of even a "mere" 15 million suddenly inoperative vehicles      is sobering, and should be considered by EPA officials      along with the weighty health concerns. (Note: The      environmental impact of new production to replace those      cars should also be kept in mind!)    </p>    <h3>      WHERE DO WE STAND?    </h3>    <p>      At this point, the question might not be how many vehicles      will be affected, but rather what the effects may be . . .      and it seems that the answer hinges upon precisely how much      lead is contained in each gallon of fuel.    </p>    <p>      With regard to the major problem of valve recession,      current data appear to be contradictory. In the face of      industry arguments that any less than 0.20 gplg of gasoline      is detrimental to valve surfaces, the EPA counters with the      Doelling report, a 1971 study conducted for the Cities      Service Oil Company, which indicated that lead-content      levels of between 0.04 and 0.07 gplg were sufficient to      stave off valve recession. Therefore, the EPA maintains      that the 1986 level of 0.10 provides a sufficent margin of      safety for those cars and trucks that were designed to use      leaded fuel.    </p>    <p>      The agency's position, however, ignores the proposed total      lead ban due as early as 1988. Others, though, have focused      attention on the problems this ban could cause. According      to research done within the automotive valve industry,      damaging recession occurred 10 to 20 times more quickly      when unleaded fuel, rather than leaded, was used in engines      designed to operate with lead. In addition, other research      showed that the damaging effects increased substantially as      driving speeds increased from 30 mph to 45 or 55 mph. But      perhaps the most convincing argument comes from Japan's      Automobile Fuel Research Committee, where in four months of      using unleaded fuel in conventional vehicles driven at 50      mph, tests indicated extensive damage to valve stems and      seats, all within 3,000 to 5,000 miles of operation.    </p>    <p>      Even though valve-seat deterioration may be a major      concern, a second specter may also have to be dealt with.      With lead content substantially reduced or eliminated,      detonation may become a serious problem unless suitable      alternatives are developed to combat knock and preignition.      Under normal driving conditions, detonation doesn't occur      given a nominal engine compression ratio and an adequate      octane rating. But under heavyload conditions (which could      include trailertowing or even passing), the energy and heat      released by sudden preignition knock can burn holes in      pistons in a matter of moments.    </p>    <h3>      IS THERE LIFE AFTER LEAD?    </h3>    <p>      At this writing, it doesn't seem likely that the EPA will      bring to light any immediate solutions to the problems      described. That responsibility seems to fall on technicians      within the petroleum and automotive supply industries. To      be sure, alternatives to tetraethyl lead for valve      lubrication-phosphorous, sodium, or      methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyln      (MMT)-are being investigated . . . but the first is      more detrimental to catalysts than lead is and may have      some adverse health effects as well. The remaining two seem      less threatening, but their value as lubricants is still in      question.    </p>    <p>      The uncertainty surrounding minimum octane requirements may      not pose much of a problem, but it must be dealt with      nonetheless. Refiners, caught between EPA mandates and      motorists' real-life needs, have been using blending agents      such as methyltertiary-butyl ethyl (MTBE), tertiary-butyl      alcohol (TBA), and both methyl and ethyl alcohol (the 10%      component of widely marketed gasohol) to give their      products the necessary octane boost. But they argue that      there's a vast difference between a blending agent, which      is nothing more than a highoctane fuel, and an antiknock      additive, which is a true combustion catalyst. Essentially,      the concentration of blending agents might have to be 50      times greater than that of an additive such as tetraethyl      lead to have the same effect . . . and that could produce      an economic nightmare.    </p>    <p>      Where does all this leave the millions of motorists      presently operating leaded-fuel vehicles? Let's hope not on      the side of the road, staring down at what was once an      engine. On the bright side, it's agreed that a vehicle      burning leaded fuel over many thousands of miles has a      veneer of lead built up on the valve surfaces which, under      moderate driving conditions, might last more than 5,000      miles. But a half-year's worth of driving won't seem like      much compensation once the party's over. Though the health      hazards of lead in the environment are widely known, the      economic hazards of leaving 10 or 20 million American      motorists holding the bag are not . . . and the whole lead      question, at this point, seems to be lacking an acceptable      answer.    </p>
