                <p>      <em>"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to      repeat it."-George Santayana</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Susan Glaese    </h5>    <p>      Our farming grandparents knew that a record of growing      experiences kept over the years would show patterns and      reveal truths unique to one growing area. In fact, people      used to pass on such information from one generation to the      next to help weed out mistakes and perpetuate successes.    </p>    <p>      Record keeping can help you discover what works and what      doesn't. For instance, most of us gardeners get so carried      away by the sheer joy of spring planting that we seriously      oversow. As a result, we end up with zucchini sprawled all      over the pathways . . . unharvested beets that have turned      into woody baseballs . . . and scads of spinach that's      bolted to seed. But if your garden records make you stare      your past overindulgences in the face, you may well sober      up and learn to plant a more realistically sized plot the      next year.    </p>    <p>      But you have to keep your record-keeping system simple,      because if you don't, you won't stick to it! There's the      rub, right?    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, there is no standard form (that we could      tidily reproduce on this magazine page) for keeping records      . . . because of this basic premise: What you record should      depend on what you want to learn. Your record-keeping      system will be a lot more useful (and less work to      maintain) if you first decide what you're trying to find      out.    </p>    <p>      For instance, Mr. A. Count may want only to keep track of      his expenses through a year to see if he's getting his      produce for less than he'd pay at the grocery store. Ms. X.      Tinct, on the other hand, is trying to help save 50      heirloom plants and wants to master their specific      cultivation needs. Both gardeners will need records, but      completely different kinds of records.    </p>    <p>      Your own evaluation goals may depend upon one or more of      the following purposes:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Food Preservation:</strong> Would you like to quit      planting too much squash and too few peas?<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Good Varieties and Their Sources</strong> : Which      tomato grew best in your backyard, and where did it come      from?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Timing:</strong> Did you plant too early and watch      your crops get set back by frost . . . or too late and hit      the peak of the annual pest infestation?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Want to give your plot a      balance of root, fruit, and leaf crops? Can't do it unless      you know what went where in past plantings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Succession Planting:</strong> Like to maximize your      space-or keep your produce from all coming in at      once-by creating an orderly progression of crops?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fertilizer Records:</strong> What compost and soil      amendments have you been using? How much? Where? Have they      helped?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garden Areas:</strong> Are some sections of your      plot drier, wetter, colder, etc., than others? Which crops      do best in which areas?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Different Growing Techniques:</strong> Do raised      beds work better for you than rows? Does mulching help some      (or all) of your crops? Which companion-planting      combinations work? Does planting at different soil      temperatures-or by the moon-have an effect?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Costs:</strong> How much have you invested in      fertilizers, tools, seed, labor, etc.? (Such records are      essential if you hope to do any market gardening.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Etcetera:</strong> Greenhouse culture, seed      inventories, water use-your record goals are limited      only by your needs and imagination!    </p>    <h3>      METHODS TO THE MADNESS    </h3>    <p>      Just as you'll develop your own specific      record-keeping goals, you'll also have to develop      your own record-keeping methods-to discover the      note-taking system that will work best for you and that      you'll be most likely to stick with. Here are some ideas      from my own experience to help get you started.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Notebook:</strong> The classic tool for the      job. A notebook is easily portable and highly adaptable to      individual purposes. Some folks recommend not using a      three-ring binder notebook-they say if you can take a      page out and lose it, you will! I like to live dangerously,      though, in exchange for the luxury of shifting pages around      at will and of adding graph paper for charts.    </p>    <p>      Each year, I draw my garden outline on a notebook page and      staple two sheets of tracing paper over it. I write down my      first plantings on the original page. Then on the first      sheet of tracing paper, I record the harvest date of the      initial crops and the next plantings that went in. The      second tracing sheet is used for any third crops. This way      I can see at a glance what plants I grew in each bed.    </p>    <p>      Another advantage to a binder notebook is that you can add      three-holed manila folders to it. You'll be surprised what      you can stash in these: photographs of your garden, copies      of useful articles, the information on empty seed packets,      etc. (I've even been known to tuck away a bluebird feather      or autumn leaf in mine.) You can label folders by the      vegetable or by the month.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Index Cards:</strong> The index card is also a very      versatile record-keeping tool. You can set up a chart      system on the front and use the back for additional notes.      Index cards come in a variety of colors for convenient      reference, are easy to shuffle around as needed, and stay      orderly and safe in their own box. I keep a separate      section, divided by vegetable headings, for writing the      location of helpful articles and books on the different      crops I grow, along with useful cultivation facts I've      learned over the years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chalk or Felt-Tipped-Marker Board:</strong> Great      to have in your toolshed or greenhouse for writing notes      when you have grubby fingers. Just remember to transfer the      information to paper later on!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Calendars:</strong> When people first see the      scrawlfilled draft-horse calendar on my wall, the first      words out of their mouths are, "Is this your diary?" I do      write a record of each day's events in its blank spaces; I      guess it's the closest thing to a personal journal I have      the perseverance to maintain.    </p>    <p>      But a calendar can serve a more important purpose for the      conscientious gardener: Every winter I sit down with one      and write in my upcoming "garden duty" dates: approximate      days for starting vegetables, when to add bonemeal to the      blueberries, etc.    </p>    <p>      I also write down-in a set-aside recordkeeping      space-notes to add to the next year's calendar. Here I      record important reminders and lessons learned. For      instance, last March when the spring winds blew away a      day's work of adding leaf mulch, I wrote that event down      for next March-to remind me not to make the same      mistake twice!    </p>    <p>      The arrival of the first firefly, robin, swallowtail, and      goldenrod bloom are notable events, as well. Keep track of      those and someday you may be able to plant by the signs of      nature as our forefathers and foremothers did: "When the      oak leaves are the size of squirrel's ears . . ."    </p>    <p>      I find being able to look over a calendar of the year to      come-and seeing all those jotted-down bits of      hard-won wisdom-is indispensable to my efforts      to become a better gardener. In fact, I urge you, if you      try no other note taking, do keep "year ahead" notes this      annum for 1987! If you do just that one step, I'm sure      you'll begin to discover for yourself just how useful and      important good record keeping can be!    </p>
