                        <p>      It's a damp, gray, chilly day, and your mood has begun to      mirror the elements. What to do? Get out the soup pot! In      no time at all, a bubbling broth will fill the house with      rich aromas, lifting your spirits and sparking your      appetite. And, come suppertime, there'll be bowls of      steaming soup, for warming icy fingers and cheering      winter-weary hearts.    </p>    <p>      The recipe below, taken from MOTHER'S Fresh Foods Country      Cookbook, makes a hearty soup that, with its whole wheat      dumplings, is a meal in itself.    </p>    <h3>      CREAMY VEGETABLE SOUP WITH PARSLEY DUMPLINGS    </h3>    <h3>      Soup:    </h3>    <p>      <em>3 cups water or broth<br />      2 medium onions, chopped<br />      2 celery stalks, diced<br />      2 cups fresh or canned tomatoes (cut up tomatoes, include      juice)</em> <em><br />      2 carrots, sliced 2 potatoes, diced<br />      1 or 2 cups other favorite vegetables<br />      1/2 cup margarine or butter<br />      1/2 cup whole wheat flour salt and pepper to taste</em>    </p>    <h3>      Dumplings:    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 cups whole wheat flour</em> <em><br />      3 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1/4 cup minced parsley<br />      1/4 cup shortening<br />      1 egg, slightly beaten<br />      3/4 cup milk</em>    </p>    <p>      In a large, covered pot, cook the vegetables in the water      or broth until the firmest ones are barely tender (about 30      minutes). Melt the butter or margarine in a small saucepan      and stir in the flour to form a smooth paste. Mix in 1 or 2      cups of the hot broth to make a lumpfree sauce, add salt      and pepper, then gradually stir the thickening into the      large pot of soup. For the dumplings, sift together the      flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the parsley and      shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix the      egg and milk, and blend into the dry ingredients until they      are just dampened. Drop the batter by spoonfuls on top of      the boiling soup, cover the pot, and simmer for 12 minutes      before serving. Serves six.    </p>    <p>      The Fresh Foods Country Cookbook is available from Mother's      Bookshelf, P.O.
