                    <p>      <em>An old box, a few odds and ends-and your      guidance-can bring cheer into any child's      day.</em><br /><em>By Craig and Liz Larcom</em>    </p>    <p>      When winter weather clamps a damper on your youngsters'      usual activities, it's time to put a little magic in their      lives by helping them build a Quiz-In-A-Box. This simple      contraption holds a surefire double-barreled appeal for      school-agers: They get to make up their own test questions      for a change . . . and they get to feel the excitement and      satisfaction of tackling a basic electrical project.    </p>    <p>      You don't have to be an electrical whiz to direct them,      either. Just follow the easy (and safe) instructions, and      even if it's your first voltaic venture, you'll carry the      day.    </p>    <h3>      READY, SET . . .</h3>        <p>      First, of course, you'll need to round up the necessary      tools and materials. (If you have more than one budding      electrician, you'll probably want to ferret out the makings      for a Quiz-In-A-Box for each youngster; the cost per device      should come to less than a dollar, and the children will      enjoy trading boxes and trying each other's test      questions.)    </p>    <p>      For each game, find a sturdy, lidded box that's at least an      inch deep and no less than about 8" X 10" overall.      Department-store gift boxes are ideal, but don't hesitate      to improvise with whatever you have on hand; even an      ordinary shoe box will do, with some minor alterations to      the following instructions. You'll also need a sheet of      plain lettersize paper, about 10' of light insulated bell      wire, at least 18 brass paper fasteners, a A-battery, and a      small 1.5- to 2.5-volt bulb (such as a standard flashlight      bulb). Plus, to put it all together, you'll need scissors,      duct tape, a jackknife, a cutting board, a pen, and      longnose pliers. Wire strippers will come in handy, too.    </p>    <p>      If the box is white or a solid color, you can leave it as      is-but if it has print or a design on it that might      be distracting, scrounge up a sheet of plain wrapping paper      or a paper bag cut flat with which to cover the lid, and      cellophane or masking tape to hold the covering in place.    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to call the youngsters and get started.    </p>    <h3>      GO!</h3>    <p>      If the box lids are to be covered with paper, this is the      time to do it. Help each child cut and tape the wrapping or      bag paper over the lid. Also, if the sheet of letter-size      paper is the same size or larger than the box lid, it'll be      necessary to cut the sheet to fit the lid, minus about two      inches at the top. This will leave enough open space at the      top of the lid for the question and answer wires and the      bulb.    </p>    <p>      Now, with those preliminaries out of the way, your charges      can turn their attention to composing questions and      answers. Give them plenty of free rein here to build in      individu ality; they might want to use riddles, math      problems, trivia, posers on their favorite subject, or any      variation thereof. Just show them how to set up a column of      questions and a column of answers on the sheet of paper,      and let them go at it. The items within each column should      be spaced about 3/4" apart, and there should be around 2"      to 3" between the columns themselves. (Precision isn't      particularly necessary here, but if the youngsters have a      really hard time keeping their columns straight, you may      want to write or type up their tests for them.) The number      of questions and answers, of course, is limited only by the      length of the paper. Even if the children had to cut a      couple inches off the paper to allow room at the top of the      lid, there should be space enough for at least eight or      nine items.    </p>    <p>      While your offspring are busy creating and composing their      question-and-answer sheets, you can cut and strip the wires      they'll need. For each box, cut as many lengths of wire as      there are questions, making each piece long enough to reach      easily from the top of one column to the bottom of the      other. Then nip two more pieces that are 5" longer than the      first ones, and cut one shorty just 3" long. Now, use your      wire strippers or knife to remove about a half inch of      insulation from the ends of each segment.    </p>    <p>      When the children have finished their question-and-answer      sheets, have them mark a dot a bit to the left of each      query and each response. With that done, each youngster can      position the sheet on the lid and tape it in place. Then      it'll be your job (unless your progeny are old enough to      use a jackknife) to put the lid on a cutting board and make      the following cuts: a cross centered in the space above the      questions . . . a puncture, level with but far to each side      of the cross . . . and a small hole at each of the dots      marked on the sheet.    </p>    <p>      It's now a simple matter for your young builders to shove      in the paper fasteners, one at each question or answer      hole.    </p>    <h3>      WIRING</h3>        <p>      As they work, it would be a good idea to remind your      children that, although the electricity stored in a little      AA battery is not dangerous to them, wall outlets are the      source of much more powerful current and should be left      alone. Also emphasize at this point that they'll need to      concentrate on getting their wiring just right, with good,      tight connections, in order for their Quiz-In-A-Boxes to      function properly.    </p>    <p>      Now it's time to connect the bulb and batteries.      Demonstrate the process while the children work along: Poke      the shortest wire and one of the two longest wires up      through the cross in the box lid. Then wrap one end of      either of the wires around the bulb's metal collar, and      fasten it in place with duct tape.    </p>    <p>      Using long-nosed pliers, twist the other wire into a tight      spiral at one end, and tape it securely to the bulb's      bottom bump. Push the collar and wires down through the      cross to wedge the bulb in place.    </p>    <p>      Now, feed the long, dangling wire back up through the      nearest corner hole . . . and wrap the short-wire end into      a curlicue and tape it to the knobby (positive) end of the      battery.    </p>    <p>      Tape one end of the second long wire to the battery's      smooth (negative) end, and poke the opposite end of the      wire up through the other corner hole. And last, tape the      battery itself to the underside of the lid.    </p>    <p>      At this point the youngsters can turn their boxes over and      touch the ends of the long wires together-the bulb will      light up if the circuit is working. If the globe doesn't      gleam, check the wiring; the lamp connections are the most      likely to be at fault, so start there. Once everything is      working, the long wires should be taped down to the      underside of the lid near the corner holes, to prevent them      from being pulled out by over-exuberant testtakers.    </p>    <p>      The hard part's done now. All that remains is to join each      question with its answer: Put one end of a wire between the      two legs of a fastener . . . wrap it full circle around      both legs . . . and spread the fastener flat. Now repeat      the process to connect the other end of the wire to the      appropriate fastener in the opposite column . . . and do      the same for the remaining questions and answers. (You may      be able to save your young friends some frustration by      checking the first few links they make, to be sure they      haven't become confused while trying to locate the bottoms      of the correct fasteners.)    </p>    <h3>      DONE!</h3>    <p>      With all the paper fasteners connected in pairs, your      little ones can put the lids to their boxes in place over      the bottoms, to protect the vulnerable innards from mishap.      Show the young builders how the bulb lights when one long      wire is touched to a question and the other to a correct      answer-and then stand back to watch the kids light up with      pride as they test their completed masterpieces!    </p>
