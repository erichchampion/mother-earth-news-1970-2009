                          <h5 id="byline">by Greg and Pat Williams</h5>        <p>      Peat pots, plastic flats, foam cups we've tried most of the      traditional systems for starting seedlings. But last year      we experimented with soil blocks, and now you won't find us      using any other method! The blocks are easy to make and      very inexpensive, and they work wonderfully. There are      several mail-order sources for the little machines that      produce these cubes; a four-blocks-at-a-time model costs      under $20 and should last a lifetime. And we've had      excellent results using commercial potting soil with our      block maker instead of the costly mixes that are "specially      formulated" for soil blocks.    </p>    <p>      We have run into one problem, though: Top watering causes      erosion damage to the blocks, no matter what medium we use.      You can get around this by using misters, but then you have      to water quite frequently.    </p>    <p>      We think bottom watering is the way to go. Put absorbent      cloth under the soil blocks and stick one end of the cloth      into a container of water. The material will act as a wick,      absorbing moisture and bringing it to the bottom of the      blocks.    </p>    <p>      Our particular arrangement (which, admittedly, is difficult      to move) consists of two-inch soil blocks on an old cookie      sheet. One end of a thin cloth diaper runs under the      blocks, while the other end rests in a waterfilled bread      pan that sits just below the cookie sheet. No doubt you      could easily make a more attractive and portable unit from      scrap wood and plastic cookware. The important point is      that a diaper-or similar absorbent cloth-works      just as well as the expensive capillary matting sold by      horticultural supply houses.    </p>    <p>      When using cloths for bottom watering, make sure they're      wet before you add the soil blocks. And don't let the water      containers go dry! You'll probably need to add liquid only      once every few days-no more daily watering or hourly      misting!    </p>    <h3>      RESEARCH BRIEFS    </h3>    <p>      No-trench asparagus? Are there better ways to transplant      asparagus crowns than the tried-and-true, but truly      laborious, deeptrench method? Connecticut investigators      have tried planting one-year-old crowns of Mary Washington      asparagus in the usual trenches . . . directly on the soil      surface and covered with 3"-high mounds . . . and just      below the top of 8"-high raised beds. After the first      growing season, the crowns in the beds and those in the      mounds had a significantly better survival rate than the      ones in trenches . . . and more spears per crown, to boot!      Time will tell how long-term yields compare among the three      methods.    </p>    <p>      Blueberries love peat! Adding organic matter to heavy,      mineral-laden soil is a "must" for promoting good      establishment and growth of newly planted blueberries. But      not all sources of organic matter are equal. According to      Georgia experimenters, peat is a better soil amendment for      blueberries than pine bark and far superior to sawdust.      (However, two quarts of peat added to each planting hole      worked just as well as four quarts did.) And Mississippi      researchers have discovered that water-holding gel products      are not beneficial. So use peat with blues for best      results.    </p>    <p>      Stop damping-off. Damping-off, the destruction of young      seedlings by soil organisms, is perhaps most commonly due      to Pythium debaryanum and Rhizoctonia solani fungi.      Standard recommendations for controlling the problem      include using sterile growing media, applying fungicides,      improving drainage and ventilation, and even watering with      dilute chamomile tea. Botanists in India have announced      another preventive (at least for damping-off due to R.      solani): Simply add organic matter. Their research shows      that adding organic materials at the rate of 1% by weight      to fungus-infected growing media significantly inhibits      damping-off of seedlings. Plant materials with a high      carbonto-nitrogen ratio (such as straw) were most      effective.    </p>        <p>      Rotate your sweet potatoes! Plan now to rotate your plots      of sweet potatoes. Researchers in Louisiana report that old      plant residues reduce growth of future vine      cuttingsapparently by preventing proper nodulation.    </p>    <p>      Don't plant peas in compacted soil! Garden peas are very      sensitive to soil conditions-yields can be greatly reduced      if they are grown in compacted soil. Experiments in England      suggest that recultivating a compacted seedbed to a depth      of four inches before planting will restore yields to those      matching loose-soil levels.    </p>    <h3>      GLEANINGS    </h3>    <p>      Healthy Harvest lists over 300 organizations concerned with      sustainable agriculture and horticulture. It's available      for $6.95 postpaid from Healthy Harvest, 1424 16th St.      N.W., Suite 105, Washington, DC 20005 . . . . For an      introduction to fruit growing by biodynamic methods (which      use fertilizers and pesticides made from natural animal,      plant, and mineral materials), take a look at the 40-page      Iduna Fruit Tree Care Program: A BioDynamic Spray and      Cultivation Schedule, $5.50 postpaid from Iduna, P.O. Box      1582, Sag Harbor, NY 11963 . . . . The perfect guide to      help you plan for continuous bloom from early spring into      fall is "Sequence of Bloom of Perennials, Biennials, and      Bulbs," Cornell University Extension Information Bulletin      196 ($1.60 postpaid from Distribution Center, 7 Research      Pk., Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850). This bulletin      is designed for use in the Northeast, but can be helpful in      other areas as well .... Gardening with Children is a      delightful guide to "learning while growing," and a bargain      at only $3.05 (postpaid) from Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000      Washington Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11225.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Greg and Pat Williams raise most of      their own food on a small farm and publish</em>      <em>HortIdeas, a fine newsletter on gardening research and      products (available for $10 a year from G. & P.
