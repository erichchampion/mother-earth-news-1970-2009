Back in 1948 he began      collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural      construction materials and techniques. He combed the world      for ideas, tried them and started writing about his      experiments.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's      articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUTand GREEN REVOLUTION.      Ken has also issued a three-year series of pieces (called      TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun pit design of his      has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.    </p>    <p>      This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from      OWNER-BUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT      HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters      of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my      presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I      apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available      right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,      California 9364 for $10.00.<br />      -MOTHER    </p>		</div>    <p>      From 100 to 150 million Asian families live in substandard      houses-in crowded, unsanitary hovels. This estimate      comes from a mission of the United Nations on <em>Tropical      Housing</em> . The basic housing problem of Asian's      millions was presented at the opening session of the 1953      <em>United Nations Seminar on Housing and Community      Development.</em>    </p>    <p>      American dwellings are bad enough, but they are mansions      compared to what Asians have. It has long been taken for      granted in America that the world's masses-the      colored people of Asia, Africa, and Latin      America-will remain miserably housed. It is taken for      granted no longer-especially by the insurgent masses      themselves.    </p>    <p>      Research on housing for underdeveloped areas has begun. In      1954 the <em>National Building Institute,</em> under the      auspices of the <em>South African Council for Scientific      and Industrial Research,</em> began a research project on      low cost housing for the urban Bantu. Its final report,      <em>Research Studies</em> <em>on The Costs of Urban Bantu      Housing,</em> a thorough piece of work dealing with social,      economic and technical factors, establishes certain minimum      standards of building performance.    </p>    <p>      Curiously, this capable research staff chose the familiar      brick as the most satisfactory building material to meet      basic housing requirements. The reasons for this choice can      be appreciated when the nature of the material is      understood, and one observes a master brick mason at work.      For one thing, the size of the burnt clay brick has      remained nearly constant since the manufacture of these      building units was taken over from the baking of clay      pottery in ancient Egypt. One advantage of small building      units is adaptability to practically any design. The size      and weight of a brick, moreover, are perfectly scaled to      human use. A work rhythm develops as a master brick mason      establishes his balance, picking up a brick with one hand      and a trowel of mortar with the other.    </p>    <p>      The brick-on-brick procedure of wall construction, however,      is far behind some of the latest monolithic wall-forming      methods. Trade organizations like the Portland Cement      Association, the Structural Clay Products Institute and the      National Concrete Masonry Association were actually the      first to anticipate the waning use of individual masonry      units. These organizations have spent millions of dollars      developing improved masonry units, tools and equipment for      speeding block construction, and even more efficient      systems of wall construction. As is usually the case in      such highly organized projects, very little of this      invaluable research has seen the light of day.    </p>    <p>      The ancient slow brick-on-brick method of construction      persists. But where the professional block layer is too      routinized to experiment with an unorthodox masonry unit,      the amateur owner-builder, with his open mind, can make the      experimental approach and profit by it. The purpose of this      chapter is to familiarize the owner-builder both with the      standard practices of block and brick laying and with some      of the new departures in wall construction in and outside      of the masonry block industry.    </p>    <p>      Masonry units have at least one structural advantage over      monolithic (e.g., poured concrete) construction; as small      units they are, in effect, preshrunk. Less      shrinkage-cracking takes place and therefore less      temperature reinforcement is required customarily in      masonry walls. However, as with any material, the quality      of workmanship plays a decisive role in the structural      values of the building. Strength and resistance to rain      penetration of clay brick walls depend more upon the      <em>completeness of bond</em> between mortar and brick than      any other single factor. According to laboratory tests at      the National Bureau of Standards, partially filled mortar      joints result in leaking walls, and reduce the strength of      masonry from 50 to 60 percent. All joints in both the      backing and facing should be completely filled with mortar      <em>as the brick is laid.</em> The key to good brick laying      is in generous usage of water. Bricks are highly      absorptive, and if laid dry will absorb water from the      mortar before the bond has developed. Besides a thorough      soaking of the brick a few hours before use, the mortar      should be mixed with the maximum amount of water that it is      possible to use and still produce a workable mix. Where on      the one hand the compressive strength of mortar increases      with increased proportions of cement and with decreased      water-cement ratio, the tensile bond strength between      mortar and brick increases with <em>increased</em> flow of      the mortar-the addition of maximum water. However, in      most masonry structures strength of mortar is of secondary      importance to bond strength, workability, water retentivity      and low volume change. In areas where resistance to lateral      forces such as earthquakes and high winds is important, the      strength of the wall depends primarily upon the strength of      the bed joints through which failures normally occur. A      good mortar proportion for brick work consists of 2 parts      cement, 1 part fire clay or hydrated lime, and 9 parts      graded sand    </p>    <p>      Concrete masonry should be laid with a somewhat drier      mortar, and unlike clay brick, the blocks themselves must      be kept dry before and during laying in the wall. For      ordinary service a mortar proportion of 2 parts cement, 1      part fire clay and 6 parts sand has proven generally      satisfactory.    </p>    <p>      The first course of concrete masonry can be set either      directly onto the freshly poured foundation footing or on a      bed of mortar above it. In either event one should first      accurately set the corner block and adjust all intermediate      units to fit both wall-distance and mortar-spacing. This      last process is known as "running out the bond." Little      difficulty will be encountered if the block sizes conform      to the 4-inch module, and if the wall lengths are designed      with this "modular coordination" in mind. On this first      course the blocks should be carefully checked for correct      alignment and plumb. The use of a heavy line (nylon is      best) is essential for keeping accurate alignment and      level.    </p>    <p>      After the first course is laid around the perimeter of the      house, every inside or outside corner is laid      up-usually to four or five courses higher than the      center of the wall. As the corner course is laid, it must      be checked with a level for alignment, for being plumb and      for being level. Furthermore each block should be carefully      checked with a level or straightedge to insure that the      faces of the block are in the same plane. The use of a      storypole, which is simply a board with markings for each      course in height, provides accuracy in establishing the top      of the masonry for each course.    </p>    <p>      The next step in building a masonry wall is to lay blocks      between the corners. The top-and-outside edges of these      "stretcher" blocks are kept in line with a taut string. A      little practice in applying mortar and setting blocks will      make it possible to set each unit with a minimum of      adjustment. It is important to make adjustments for final      position while the mortar is soft and plastic. Attempts at      adjustment after the mortar has stiffened will most      certainly break the mortar bond and allow the penetration      of water.    </p>    <p>      Watertight mortar joints as well as a neat final appearance      depend upon proper tooling. This tooling operation compacts      the mortar and forces it tightly against the blocks on both      sides of the joint. This is best done with a concave or      V-shaped tool as soon as the mortar has become "thumbprint      hard."    </p>    <p>      A wide variety of blocks which conform to the 4-inch module      are now available-designed to handle just about any      conceivable wall problem. Of special value is the "header"      block which avoids the former necessity of building wooden      bond-beam forms. A block is also available to receive the      side flanges of metal window and door frames. Even      window-sill blocks are made, thereby eliminating the need      for any wood trim in an all-fireproof masonry home.    </p>    <p>      A large number of masonry block manufacturers now sell the      "mortarless" block. In my judgment this block is much more      suited to the average owner-builder. It can be laid faster,      with less need for skilled labor. As a general rule the      mortarless block is more precision-engineered. A variety of      joining designs have been developed; tongue-and-groove,      ship-lap, ball-and-socket, etc. In practice, one lays the      first course in the wet foundation footing around the      perimeter of the house. Obviously it is important to get      this first layer level, in line and plumb, as the rest of      the wall is established by this first course. Blocks are      then set layer upon layer until the desired height is      attained. No mortar is used and the blocks fit in one      position only. When the final height is reached the cores      at the corners and on 2-foot centers are poured with      concrete.    </p>    <p>      Another major improvement in the masonry industry occurred      when they started making the <em>lightweight block,</em>      using cinder, pumice, basalt, "perlite," etc. Insulation      and sound absorption qualities are higher, and, with less      weight involved, the units can be laid faster.    </p>    <p>      One would naturally suppose that the value of a building      material depends less on appearance than on its structural      and insulation values. But modern taste has dictated      unreasonably high standards for exterior appearance. In      some circles the degree of affectation supersedes the more      basic cost and strength considerations. In the 1930's the      attractive face-brick was first used extensively as a front      wall cover-up, and for a while about every other new house      suffered from this "veneereal" disease.    </p>        <p>      In more recent years the trend has been toward masonry      grills and patterned block units. These units are      manufactured in practically any color, shape, size, or      texture. One can buy "split block," "slump block," or      "scored block "-depending upon the desired effect one      wishes to achieve. There is also an equally wide range of      <em>pattern,</em> depending on how one treats the mortar      joint or combines the blocks in any one of a hundred      different ways.    </p>        <p>      In contrast to the growing number of builders who go to      such absurd lengths in finding new ways of using concrete      masonry for surface effect, an equally strong effort is      being made to develop methods whereby houseneedy families      may build their own homes out of masonry units produced by      themselves-for structure and enclosure rather than      "looks." The Tuskegee Institute staff was 15 years in      developing a concrete block wall-building system. Said F.      D. Patterson, Institute president:    </p>    <p>      Our experiments in housing have been oriented toward      farmers because they have the greatest need in this area      for housing improvement, but are least able to provide      themselves with the improvement needed through normal      commercial arrangements.    </p>    <p>      Experimentation at Tuskegee Institute has revealed that      building costs can be substantially reduced by utilization      of labor of the farm family in seasons when there is little      demand for labor in farm production. Without specific      training and under minimum supervision, unskilled labor in      home construction can be performed by members of the      family. Short courses have, in a brief period, prepared      farmers for satisfactory performance on semi-skilled jobs      in home building. In the Tuskegee Institute experiments,      reduction in material cost and in labor cost have made      possible convenient and attractive homes for farmers with      the expenditure of surprisingly small amounts of cash.    </p>    <p>      Architect Frank Lloyd Wright was one of the first to      develop an "improved" concrete block system. His Usonian      Automatic has the singular quality of providing a      continuous air space between the inner and outer wall. This      air space, of course, is invaluable for insulation against      heat, cold, and moisture. The Alcon Block is another type      of twin-wall construction which successfully incorporates a      "motionless" or dead-air space between the outer and inner      walls. No direct horizontal contact is made between the      blocks. This 16-inch square unit can be produced on the      site by the owner-builder, using a simply constructed metal      "gang form".    </p>    <p>      Absence of a continuous air space in conventionally built      8-inch brick walls is perhaps the main reason, construction      wise, why this type of wall is becoming less prevalent.      Experience has shown that in instances where the brick      header is continuous through the full thickness of the      wall, extreme care must be exercised in construction in      order to obtain a wall that will resist the penetration of      heavy rains accompanied by high winds. Concrete block or      structural clay tile is usually used to "back-up" the clay      brick facing. As is often the case where different      materials are used (concrete and burnt clay in this      instance) the thermal and moisture expansion coefficients      of facing and back-up are different. Movement of the      concrete block back-up, due to shrinkage as the wall dries      out, creates an eccentric load on the brick headers which      tends to rupture the bond between headers and mortar at the      external wall face.    </p>    <p>      The logical solution to this problem of moisture      penetration and poor insulation is to <em>separate</em> the      inner from the outer wall. The Cavity Wall has been used in      England for fifty years or more, but has only recently      gained favor in this country. New York's nineteen story      Veterans' Hospital is claimed to be the highest cavity wall      structure in existence. The wall consists of an outer layer      of facing brick and an inner layer of concrete block, with      a 2-inch continuous air space between. The two layers are      tied together by "Z" ties spaced 16 inches apart vertically      and 24 inches horizontally. The cavity is drained to the      outside by weep holes.    </p>        <p>      Where resistance to heat flow in addition to that provided      by the air space is required, insulating material can be      installed directly into the cavity. The wall then has the      double advantage of the lower heat gain typical of clay      products and a high resistance to heat flow due to the      cavity stuffing. According to tests at the Armour Research      Foundation and Pennsylvania State College, the pouring-type      insulation (SCR) produced by Owens-Coming Fiberglass proved      superior to all other varieties.    </p>    <p>      Cheaply built brick buildings suffered perhaps the greatest      structural devastation in the 1933 Long Beach (California)      earthquake. The human misery and financial loss at this      time prodded the masonry industry to find safer and      stronger ways of budding with brick. So now we have two new      methods of brick construction: Reinforced Brick Masonry and      Reinforced Grouted Brick Masonry. For a wall height of 20      feet, an un-reinforced thickness would have to be 12 inches      whereas the reinforced thickness can be reduced to 8      inches. That is, the un-reinforced wall requires 50% more      brick and 50% more weight must be carried by the supporting      structure. A brick or block wall reinforced every foot in      height with Dur-O-Wall steel masonry wall reinforcement      (Box 628, Syracuse, N.Y.) has 71% greater flexural strength      than its un-reinforced counterpart.    </p>    <p>      Along with the many varieties of fabricated metal      reinforcements, specially designed brick (like the Grout      Lock and SCR) are now manufactured for those who want to      insure maximum bond with reinforced grout or with the      mortar bed. Actually the same structural results can be      achieved using common brick and standard-size reinforcing      bars. The Rowlock system of reinforced brick masonry, for      instance, offers substantial savings in speed of erection      and amount of material. Perhaps the most dramatic use of      this system of construction is in the Lunt-Lake Apartment      building in Chicago. Walls of the first story are only 10      inches thick and the remaining eight stories are 8 inches      thick! This remarkable strength per thickness of wall is      achieved despite the fact that all the brick are laid on      edge-a pattern typical to Rowlock bond. One of the      developers of Rowlock, Henry Holsman, writes in the June      1949 issue of <em>Brick and Clay Record:</em>    </p>    <p>      If brick masons and manufacturers will adopt and promote      this type of reinforced brick construction, it will put the      mason and the brick industry on an equal competitive      footing with other methods of building construction, if not      far in advance of them. In my judgment it can be developed      so as to make the concrete skeleton method of construction      quite obsolete. To abolish the temporary forming in      building construction, which sometimes and quite often      costs as much as or more than the structure itself, will be      a great economical boon to the general public who, after      all, must pay the extra cost of any inefficient or      unnecessary method of building construction.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the lowest cost of all brick wall construction      methods (appropriately termed "economy wall") was developed      for the Lee County (Tupelo, Miss.) Housing Authority during      the second war. The wall construction consists of nothing      more than a 4-inch brick wall built on a reinforced brick      grade beam which in turn is supported by 8 inch by 16 inch      brick piers. The contractor's building cost of $1,538 for      each two-bedroom unit was lower than competing bids using      frame construction. This type of construction well      illustrates the fact that, from a design standpoint, the      outside layer of a brick masonry wall should not function      as a mere skin or covering; it should serve as part of the      structure as well. This is a fundamental quality which      should be insisted upon in the choice of any building      material. "Finish" should be an active load-carrying      participant rather than a passive or useless veneer.    </p>    <p>      The final stage of any masonry construction involves the      cleanup of random smears of mortar or traces of the white      efflorescence that often appears on fresh brickwork. It is      best to wait a few weeks after the last brick is laid      before applying the 10% solution of muriatic acid. A stiff      brush or rag is best for applying the acid to the wall. A      thorough wash-down with water should precede and follow the      acid treatment. This will be about the last thing that need      ever be done to the owner-built masonry home, at least      during his own lifetime. There is a real comfort in knowing      that one's masonry home has pleasing appearance and      structural durability. Good insulation and fireproofing,      from a material which is relatively cheap and convenient,      are features that help to make a masonry home a definite      candidate for selection by the amateur owner-builder.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong>   (books listed in order of importance) </p>    <p>      <em>Reinforced Brick Masonry:</em> Plummer and Blume,      Structural Clay Products Inst., Washington, D.
