                    <h3>Dear MOTHER:    </h3>    <p>      I must tear myself away from reading long enough to      acknowledge receipt of the back issues. What wonderful      material ... and to think that right away I see letters      from neighbors: Eureka Springs, West Fork, Bentonville,      even Fayetteville and several other Arkansas places I've      visited. Howdy, y'all! (This is wonderful country. I've      been from coast to coast and border to border and found but      one place that I like as well.)    </p>    <p>      MOTHER has brought me so much enjoyment and recalled so      many memories that I'd like to say a first-installment      "thank you" by sharing an experience or so.    </p>    <p>      I've had more than a passing acquaintance with so many      things in my lifetime that I might be able to help others      in difficulties they may meet. I've been city gal,      schoolmarm (nationally honored), farmer's wife, farmer,      mother, VISTA teacher. Now that I'm      retired-again-I'm a garden and flower      specialist with several sidelines belonging to my various      careers.    </p>    <p>      It's because of my own experience that the temerity of so      many-who seem to think they can go practically      emptyhanded and moneyless back to the land and live      comfortably through hard work and their love of the      countryside ("The pioneers did it, so can      we!")-simply amazes me!    </p>    <p>      Believe me, I wouldn't for one minute want to lessen the      enthusiasm or weaken the ambition of sincere young people      ... but-if you're one of them-I'd like you to      go into the great experiment with your eyes open, your head      alert and your feet planted solidly on the earth so that      you won't become disappointed and heartbroken. There is      another and better way, and if you're interested I'll point      it out. In the meantime let your wanderings include a      questioning walk through a pioneer cemetery. Look at the      markers and ask yourself, "Why?"    </p>    <p>      In that graveyard you'll find the headstone of John Doe,      65, 70 or even 80 years of age, and beside him memorials to      his beloved wives Jane (23), Anne (30) and perhaps even      Mary (50). Alongside, in the same section, there'll be rows      of little graves of children aged one month to two or three      years. That's the price the pioneers paid for our heritage.    </p>    <p>      "Oh, but it can't happen today," you say. Believe me, it      can, if you insist on doing everything the way our      ancestors had to do it, Country life doesn't have to work      out like that, but I've seen just such misfortunes.    </p>    <p>      Along with the word "organic" we must keep in our      vocabulary such concepts as moderation, reason,      consideration, cooperation, self-respect, self-sufficiency      and many others-like good judgment-which make for a      complete, fulfilled life. (Notice how few of these words      show up in your letters.) As for you more mature-minded      folks who sincerely want a satisfying lifestyle of reviving      and restoring nature, let's hope you'll save the best of      the past, use the best of the present and build a future      that we can honor and respect.    </p>    <p>      Now to a few practical points: One of the first things      you'll need after you find that little wooded farm is a big      black iron kettle-set up not too far from your spring      or well and downhill from it-and a three- or      four-inch stirring paddle. You'll have dozens of uses for      this tool besides making hominy, rendering fat for food or      soap and heating the laundry water. Do make a cover for      your kettle ... it's heavy to empty when it fills with      rain.    </p>    <p>      Another hint: Did you know that wheat will pop, and so will      milo and kafir? You need an iron skillet which will keep      the heat steady and not get too hot too soon. Take wheat of      a good grade (fanned clean, so it won't stick and burn),      spread a relatively thin layer in the hot pan and keep      stirring. The grains will brown like toast and double in      size. You can hear the kernels pop, although they don't      burst open. The aroma is delightful and the taste while      warm is to regular wheat as that of toast is to bread.      Then, if you grind the grain and recook it like any wheat      breakfast food, you'll enjoy a second surprise.    </p>    <p>      Another way I've used wheat is to soak it several hours in      at least double its bulk of water, bring it to a boil and      cook it slowly for about an hour. Then add rice in      proportion to take up the excess fluid and simmer the      cereals until they're tender. Finally, stir in raisins. Eat      the mixture as soon as it's cool enough. It can be reheated      in a double boiler, but my family seldom left that much.    </p>    <p>      Here's an idea which we're using in the third generation      ... one that you backpackers might find useful: Put a large      package of "quick cook" oatmeal in a big dishpan, add two      or three pounds of raisins and a package of dates-      chopped-and mix these ingredients thoroughly. Then      prepare a heavy syrup of Karo and sugar or molasses as if      you were going to make popcom balls. When it has reached      the right degree of stickiness to hold the mix together,      add it to the oatmeal, stir (and work fast). Then grease      your hands and make the stuff into cookies. They'll keep as      long as you let them, and should be wrapped individually to      keep them from sticking together.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of sweets, Kihi Mick wrote in MOTHER NO. 19 about      trouble in making cane syrup ... but the letter didn't tell      enough about how he was doing it for us to be able to help.      I wonder if he knows that he must plant "ribbon cane" seed,      that the crop must be headed and stripped (leaves taken      off) and the stalks left for several days to mature. Then      the stems must be cut and ground, and the juice pressed out      and boiled in a shallow pan (for faster evaporation) until      it reaches the desired consistency. I've seen it done many      times but never did it myself.    </p>    <p>      Thanks again, and best wishes to all MOTHER's readers.    </p>    <p>      Myrtle Cress<br />      Fayetteville, Arkansas    </p>
