            		<h5 id="byline">      by ROCHELLE KROOT:    </h5>          <p>      Faith B. Lasher's article "The Delightful Elderberry"      (MOTHER NO. 22) contained an editorial appeal for advice on      making jelly with honey. Accordingly, I'm passing on some      of the California Honey Advisory Board's recipes for      sugarless fruit confections.    </p>    <p>      A hint from CHAB: If you prepare jams and jellies with      natural sweetening, you should remember that the moisture      content of honey varies according to location. In      California, for example, sweets made with honey from the      northern part of the state will be softer than the same      products made with the output of bees kept farther south.    </p>    <p>      I hope these recipes will be of value to readers who love      sweets but want to avoid refined sugar. Enjoy!    </p>    <h3>PEAR AND CHERRY CONSERVE</h3>   <p>      2-1/2 to 3 pounds fully ripened Bartlett pears<br />      6 lemon slices<br />      3 Tbs. seedless golden raisins<br />      1/4 cup maraschino cherries, chopped<br />      1/3 cup maraschino cherry juice<br />      4 cups mild-flavored honey<br />      1 bottle liquid pectin    </p>    <p>      Peel, core and coarsely chop the pears. (There should be 5      cups.) Cut the lemon slices into eighths. In a      6-8-quart saucepan, mix together all the ingredients      except the pectin. Bring them to a full rolling boil,      stirring constantly, and boil them hard for 5 minutes.      (Give the mixture an occasional turn with a spoon to      prevent scorching.) Remove the pan from the heat and at      once blend in the liquid pectin. Skim off the foam with a      metal spoon, and continue to stir and skim for 5 minutes to      prevent the fruit from floating. Ladle the conserve into      hot sterilized jars and seal the containers. This recipe      makes about seven half-pint glasses.    </p>    <h3>HONEY PINEAPPLE JAM</h3>   <p>      2-1/2 cups (1-pound 4-1/2-ounce can) crushed      pineapple<br />      3 Tbs. fresh lemon juice<br />      3-1/4 cups mild-flavored honey<br />      1/2 bottle liquid pectin    </p>    <p>      In a 6-8-quart saucepan mix the crushed pineapple and      lemon juice. Add the honey and blend the ingredients well.      Then place the pan over high heat and at once stir in the      liquid pectin. Stir the mixture constantly while you bring      it to a full rolling boil and boil hard for one minute.      Take the jam from the stove and remove the foam with a      metal spoon. Alternately skim and stir the hot confection      for 5 minutes to cool it slightly and distribute the fruit      throughout. Ladle the product into hot sterilized      jars-about six of the 8-ounce size-and seal      them.    </p>    <h3>STRAWBERRY JAM</h3>     <p>      4-1/2 cups prepared fruit (about 2 quarts ripe      strawberries)<br />      1 box (1-3/4 ounces) powdered pectin<br />      7 cups mild-flavored honey    </p>    <p>      Completely crush the fully ripened strawberries, one layer      at a time, and measure 4-1/2 cups of the prepared fruit      into a 6-8-quart saucepan. Add the powdered pectin      and blend it in well. Place the pan over high heat, bring      the contents to a full rolling boil and at once mix in the      honey. Continue to boil the jam for 2 minutes, while you      stir it constantly. Then remove the pan from the fire and      follow the same skimming and cooling procedure as for Honey      Pineapple jam. Pour the result into hot sterilized jars,      seal them and let them stand at room temperature until the      spread is set (up to 24 hours).    </p>    <p>      Yield: about eleven 8-ounce glasses.    </p>    <h3>SPICY PORT WINE JELLY</h3>    <p>      2 cups port wine<br />      3 cups mild-flavored honey<br />      1/8 tsp. cinnamon<br />      1/8 tsp. cloves<br />      1/2 bottle liquid pectin    </p>    <p>      In a 6-8-quart saucepan combine the port wine, honey,      cinnamon and cloves. Stir these ingredients and bring them      to a full rolling boil. Add the liquid pectin, again bring      the mixture to a boil and cook it at that temperature for 2      minutes, stirring constantly. Remove the pan from the heat      and skim its contents with a metal spoon. Pour the jelly      into hot sterilized jars, seal them and let them stand at      room temperature until the jelly has set (up to 24 hours).      This recipe makes about eight 6-ounce glasses.    </p>    <h3>HONEY GRAPE JELLY</h3>     <p>      1 package (1-3/4 ounces) powdered pectin<br />      2-1/2 cups grape juice<br />      3-3/4 cups mild-flavored honey    </p>    <p>      Mix the pectin and grape juice in a 6-8-quart      saucepan and cook and blend them over high heat until      bubbles form all around the edge of the liquid. Slowly add      the honey, stirring constantly, and continue to stir and      cook the mixture until the entire surface is bubbling      (don't let it boil). Remove the jelly from the stove and      alternately stir and skim off the foam. Pour the confection      into hot sterilized glasses, seal them and leave them      undisturbed until the fluid has cooled and set ... about 24      hours. The approximate yield is eight 6-ounce jars.    </p>    <h3>RIPE PEACH JAM</h3>    <p>      3 pounds fully ripened peaches<br />      2 Tbs. fresh lemon juice<br />      7-1/2 cups mild-flavored honey<br />      1 bottle liquid pectin    </p>    <p>      Wash, peel and pit the peaches and chop or coarsely grind      them into the lemon juice. Measure the prepared fruit,      packing it down in the cup ... there should be 4 cups.    </p>    <p>      Mix the peaches and honey in a 6-8-quart saucepan,      bring them to a full rolling boil and boil them hard for      one minute ... keep stirring. Immediately add the liquid      pectin and repeat the boiling process for another minute.      Then remove the mixture from the heat and stir and skim it      as for Honey Pineapple jam. Ladle the mixture into hot      sterilized jars-about eleven of the 8-ounce      size-and seal the containers.    </p>
