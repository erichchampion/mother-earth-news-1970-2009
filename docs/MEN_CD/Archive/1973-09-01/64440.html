                    <hr />    <p>      In MOTHER NO. 21 Edith Little asked for information about      using yeast in a privy to decompose and deodorize feces or      "night soil". I don't know of any yeast that will serve      this purpose, but I do know that human manure can be      composted very nicely. There will be little objectionable      odor ... much less than from the average privy where waste      is allowed to pile up and putrefy, creating unhealthy      conditions. Flies will also be eliminated and the resulting      fertilizer will be of very high quality: an odorless,      crumbly black gold for the garden.    </p>    <p>      In order to compost effectively and efficiently, night soil      must be mixed with material that is high in cellulose or      carbon. I find that sawdust, wood chips, pine needles or      old leaves-in a ratio of four or five parts sawdust      or whatever to one part excrement by volume-seem to      work best. Straw or hay isn't satisfactory, for it tends to      pack down and is difficult to turn over later on.    </p>    <p>      The sawdust should be dumped down the hole of the privy      after each use to completely cover your latest "gift to the      earth". Use more if necessary, to insure that flies cannot      get down into the night soil to lay their eggs. The mixture      should be kept damp but not sopping wet.    </p>    <p>      After a period of time, as the pile builds up in volume, it      will begin to heat. At this point the material should be      turned over with a long-handled pitchfork every two or      three days, depending on how much the privy is used. This      will keep the pile cookin' by supplying air to the aerobic      bacteria responsible for the composting process ... and      will also insure that any stray fly larvae on the surface      of the mass get dug into the hot center and destroyed.    </p>    <p>      The heat is caused by the work of beneficial microorganisms      which break down the night soil-sawdust mixture. If      conditions we right, the temperature will be high enough      (at least 150° F for about 24 hours) to render the      compost completely free of any diseasecausing bacteria. As      an added safeguard, I would not use the fertilizer on      plants that will be eaten raw until the dressing has aged      for at least one year.    </p>    <p>      It would be advantageous if the privy were designed to      allow easy access to the composting chamber for turning and      removal of the contents. The facility could be as simple as      a tarp strung over a three-foot-deep pit in the ground ...      all that's needed is something to keep the pile from      getting too wet.    </p>    <p>      After the pit is full the privy should be moved to another      location ... or, if this is impractical, the compost dug      out and repiled elsewhere. You should continue to mix and      water the material until it's cool to the touch. At this      time you could throw in some red wriggler earthworms (which      can be obtained from your local bait dealer or ordered      through the classified section of <em>Gardening and      Farming</em> magazine) to further insure that the end      product will be nothing like what you started with. The      heap should then be covered with a tarp or sheet of plastic      to prevent leaching, and allowed to age for one year      (unless the fertilizer is to be used on fruit trees or      crops that will be thoroughly cooked, in which case it      could be spread as is).<br />    </p>    <p>      In MOTHER NO. 21, (pg. 110), Milton Wend suggests using      night soil which has merely been treated with hydrated      lime. I myself would be wary of fertilizing crops with      human waste unless it had heated up to 150° F in a      controlled composting operation and/or aged for at least      one year buried in a pit. (See pg. 70 of <em>The Last Whole      Earth Catalog</em> for a discussion of the latter process.)      The Chinese used to get around this precaution by never      eating any vegetables raw (see <em>Farmers of Forty      Centuries</em> by F. H. King).    </p>    <p>      Further and more detailed information on composting night      soil can be found in the book <em>Composting</em> by Harold      Gotoos ($5.00 postpaid from the American Public Health      Association, 1740 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10019). The      author also gives a nice set of plans for a community-size      methane generator.    </p>    <p>      Bruce Martin<br />      Ponca, Arkansas    </p>		<hr />    <p>      An innovation that I've seen lately-and that I would      surely include in the building/remodeling of a      privy-is the use of a vent pipe running from the vent      or waste area to above the roof. It keeps the air inside      the privy fresh and successfully eliminates the inside odor      ... even when nothing else is used.    </p>    <p>      Harold & Grace Brown<br />      Yarmouth, Maine<br />      <br />      <em>You're right, Harold and Grace ... and the article,      "Privies, Old and New," in Issue No. 14 (pages 43-46)      contains cutaway drawings of two versions of outhouses      built with such vents.-MOTHER.</em> <em><br /></em>    </p>		<hr />
