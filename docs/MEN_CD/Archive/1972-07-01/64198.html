                      <p><strong>      Yogurt making trust certainly be one of those basic,      well-loved arts that brings out the ingenuity in people!      Barbara Thiel's "Make Yer Own" article in MOTHER NO. 14, at      any rate, certainly inspired a flood of favorite down-home      methods for brewing up a batch of the creamy treat.      Most-although quite inventive-are variations on      the same theme, however, so we now consider our yogurt      class closed for the time being.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The yogurt maker in MOTHER NO. 14 works great except that      too much heat builds up in the bottom can where the light      bulb is.. . my cord began to melt and smoked up the first      batch I made. On later tries, I ended up putting the cord      and attachment for the bulb on the outside and left only      the bulb itself on the inside.    </p>    <p>      Robin Shaw<br />      New York, N.Y,    </p>    <p>      I, too, am a yogurt fan but was taught a way of incubating      that's cheaper and easier than Barbara Thiel's, After you      put your yogurt in the jars, wrap each container in a terry      cloth towel or piece of heavy material. Put the jars in a      pot (or clam steamer or metal box or cooler or whatever)      which has also been lined with towels. Place the lid on the      pot, put a weight of any kind on the lid and just let      things sit for six to eight hours. Delicious!    </p>    <p>      Nancy Cox<br />      Woods Hole, Mass.    </p>    <p>      Barbara Thiel's method of making yogurt is novel and makes      for interesting reading, but it's not as practical and      money-saving as mine . . . which uses very little      electricity and costs practically retiring because there IS      no yogurt maker involved.    </p>    <p>      All I do is first heat a quart or two of milk to just about      the boiling point (I use raw milk when I can because it's      creamier and contains all the healthful nutrients removed      during the pasteurizing of commercial milk). Then I let the      milk coat to almost room temperature and add half a cup of      yogurt for each quart of milk used. After I've stirred the      yogurt into the milk (stir until all lumps are dissolved),      I pour the mixture into a clean, warmed-run the dish      under hot water or place it in an oven for a few seconds      until it's <em>warm</em> , not <em>hot</em> -casserole      dish. Any dish will do so long as it has a cover and isn't      made of metal . . . metals may have a tendency to react      with the bacteria in the yogurt.    </p>    <p>      After I cover the dish, I wrap it in a towel so that the      heat is retained inside and leave it till eight hours later      when i check-gently-to see if it's solidified      and is the consistency that I like (Usually I make my      yogurt at night and refrigerate it in the morning).    </p>    <p>      The nice tittle gadgets are fine if you're in a crafty mood      and want to try something different, but I've used this      method for over a year now , . . and it works every time      with a minimum of fuss.    </p>    <p>      Carol Hupping<br />      Catasauqua, Pa.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER has shown several methods of making yogurt, but they      alt seem to be rather involved. May I add my 2 cents worth?    </p>    <p>      If you have an old beer cooler, a candy thermometer, a      container to put the culture in and some leftover yogurt      you really only need to spend money for a quart of milk      (skim works fine). And if you start the yogurt near      midnight and use the following method, you can limit the      subsequent "work" to putting a delicious batch of the stuff      in the refrig erator the next morning:<br />    </p>    <p>      1. Heat milk to simmer (about 170°F).    </p>    <p>      2. Pour two or three inches of 130° water in the      cooler.    </p>    <p>      3. Quickly cool the milk to 130° by setting the pan in      a bigger pot of said water and stirring with a thermometer      (easier than with a spoon, really).    </p>    <p>      4, Beat about 1/3 cup of yogurt until any lumps disappear      and then beat the milk while you add the yogurt.    </p>    <p>      5, Pour into containers (I use one-cup plastic glasses with      snap-on lids), place these in the cooler-hot water      should be level with the top of the milk-yogurt      mixture-and put the cooler lid on tight.    </p>    <p>      6. Leave the whole thing alone for five to seven      hours-till it sets-and then put lids on the      glasses and refrigerate. Turns o ut just right.    </p>    <p>      Sue Friend<br />      Cleveland Heights, Ohio    </p>    <p>      Why complicate things? Try NOT making yet own yogurt maker      (MOTHER NO. 14) . . . just stick your glass      jars-filled with the 120°F yogurt      mixture-into a carton, fill the empty spaces with      crumpled-up newspaper, wrap an old blanket or steeping bag      around the whole caboodle, stick it under your bed or in      some other out-of-the-way place and have two (six? ten?)      jars of yogurt in about six hours.    </p>    <p>      By the way, if you want thick, smooth yogurt, add one cup      of non-instant powdered milk to each quart of liquid milk.      Although I do blend the powdered version witty the regular      cow's juice I've found that heating it with the rest of the      liquid tends to make the finished yogurt lumpy. Anyway, as      long as the end product is between 115° and 120°      you're in good shape.    </p>    <p>      If you use the powdered culture for a starter, don't get      discouraged. It sometimes takes up to twelve hours to get      the first batch to set. Start by making no more than ono      quart (use a lot of starter) . . . consecutive batches will      take less time by and by.    </p>    <p>      Elisabeth Braam<br />      Reno, Nev.    </p>
