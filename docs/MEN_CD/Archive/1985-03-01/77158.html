                      <p><strong>      American Conservation Cutoff</strong></p>			    <p>      A new American Conservation Corps program, patterned after      the Youth Conservation Corps set up by FDR, has been vetoed      by President Reagan. The ACC would have employed young      people to do trail maintenance, tree planting, erosion      control, and other tasks in state and federal parks,      forests, and such. The savings from the program, compared      with the costs of hiring outside contractors to do the same      jobs, would have been huge. But the president evidently was      swayed by his budget director, David Stockman, who      apparently didn't want to spend the $225 million already      approved by Congress for the ACC.    </p>    <h3>      U.S. Sells Out Whales    </h3>        <p>      Even though all sperm whaling was supposed to stop with the      spring hunt of 1983, the United States has signed an      agreement that allows Japan to continue commercial whaling      through 1987. This action directly contradicts a 1981      International Whaling Commission ruling that the U.S.      signed to protect the whales.    </p>    <p>      According to Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge, Japan      has agreed to cease all commercial whaling by the end of      1987 in return for the U.S. concession. But dispatches in      Japanese newspapers quote Japanese officials as saying they      don't intend to stop whaling. Thus, more whales are fated      to end up as lipstick and pet food on Japanese supermarket      shelves.    </p>    <p>      "The U.S. government has just gone back on its 13-year      campaign in behalf of the whales," said FOE's wildlife      specialist, David Phillips.    </p>    <h3>      Good News for Wildlife    </h3>        <p>      Thanks to a comeback, the Bahaman swallowtail butterfly has      been dropped from the EPA's endangered species list.      Meanwhile, Tampa Bay has witnessed the reappearance of a      crustacean that supposedly disappeared 40 years ago: The      Mexican saber crab was recently spotted in the nearby      Alafia River.    </p>    <p>      In Ocean Springs, Mississippi, the sandhill crane is also      enjoying a small but steady resurgence in a 17,000-acre,      federally protected refuge. A few years ago there were      thought to be only 30 surviving sandhill cranes, but last      year the flock had increased to more than 50.    </p>    <p>      In Minnesota, the country's largest manufacturer of      electric fences has decided to redesign its product because      the fences are dangerous to hummingbirds. The small red      plastic insulators on the fences are often mistaken for      flowers by hummingbirds, which are electrocuted when they      try to extract nectar. Albert Berg, chairman of the board      for North Central Plastics, said that the style and color      of the insulators will be changed. The company advises      farmers who have fences with the old insulators to paint      the insulators another color.    </p>    <h3>      It May Be Kosher, but Should We Eat It?    </h3>    <p>      Late last vear the media had fun with an Agency for      International Development report that suggested scientists      may have found a pig whose meat could be kosher. This      discovery, according to reports, might lead to an important      new food source . . . particularly for Jews and Muslims,      who do not eat pork because "regular" pigs aren't      ruminants. (Porkers lack a second stomach, and therefore      don't have cud to chew. However, they do fulfill another      kosher requirement: They have cloven hooves.)    </p>    <p>      But hold on! Into the picture steps a California biologist      who spent years studying the "kosher pig," babirusa (or      deer boar), in the jungles of Indonesia. "Kosher or not,"      said Victoria Joan Selmier, "the babirusa is an endangered      species." Selmier's research has indicated that there are      fewer than 1,000 of the animals on the planet and that      their critical habitat is already threatened. The capture      of enough of them to begin a commercial breeding colony      might well spell the end of the wild population.<br />      <br />      Ironically, the babirusa owes its continued existence to      the fact that the people who share its habitation on the      Indonesian island of Sulawesi are Muslims and therefore      leave the babirusa alone. If these people were convinced      that it was all right to eat the animal, that would be the      end of it in no time. Selmier thinks the suggestions about      raising the babirusa domestically are hogwash. "The      babirusa wouldn't do a third as well as America's      60,000,000 hogs. Babirusa meat would be very expensive at      best, affordable only by the affluent."<br />      <br />      EDITOR'S NOTE: The worldwide organization called Friends of      the Earth is one of the most effective environmental groups      in existence today, and the activities of FOEalong with a      broad range of other news concerning ecological      developments-are described each month in its      publication titled Not Man Apart. You can become a member      of Friends of the Earth, and receive the excellent tabloid,      by sending $25 ($100 for sponsor, $1,000 for life, $12      student/low income)-or $15 for a subscription      only-to FOE, 1045 Sansome St., San Francisco, CA      94111.    </p>
