                    <h3>      Trusten Holder: Sowing for Others    </h3>        <p>      Arkansas residents who are poor, unemployed, or simply      seeking no-cost nourishment . can help themselves to fresh      turnips, free for the picking, thanks to the efforts of      Trusten Holder. "Free food is needed by many today,      especially with the high rate of unemployment," says      Holder, who spends much of his time planting turnip seeds      on unused property and along partially used rights-of-way.    </p>    <p>      Now retired after 36 years in environment-related state      jobs, Holder remains actively interested in land use. He      views ditch banks and field borders that have been disked      by farmers to prevent the growth of weeds as ideal places      to plant turnip seeds. But he also ventures onto public      land: His most ambitious effort to date took place in 1981,      when he scattered seed along an entire ten-mile stretch of      newly installed sewer line.    </p>    <p>      Holder, who has received numerous conservation awards in      his long career, derives great satisfaction from seeing      people pick the nutritious greens and roots he's planted.      He notes that it costs only about $6.00 to sow an acre, and      he tries to encourage others to follow in his footsteps.      "What better way is there," he asks, "to do good for a      minimum of cost and effort?" <em>-Marsha Gravitz</em>      .</p>      <h3>Ted Maczka: Garlic Man    </h3>        <p>      When Ted Maczka learned that Canada was importing millions      of dollars' worth of garlic annually, he set out to prove      that Canadians don't have to rely on foreign countries to      supply the herb. Now, on his farm in Prince Edward County,      Ontario, Ted raises a ton of worldclass elephant garlic      yearly.    </p>    <p>      The large bulbs grown by Maczka weigh up to six ounces each      and have giant cloves, which make peeling a breeze. The      taste of this huge garlic is reportedly excellent . . . yet      very mild. According to Ted, some people even eat it as      they would fruit-whole and raw.    </p>    <p>      The Polish-born Maczka, who calls himself the Fish Lake      Garlic Man, sells most of his organically grown crop to      stores and restaurants in Toronto. But the demand now      exceeds Maczka's supply, and Ted constantly encourages      others to contribute to Canada's self-sufficiency by      planting some cloves.    </p>    <p>      Maczka is often seen wearing a garland of garlic, which      quickly communicates his enthusiasm for the herb, and he's      always ready to elaborate on the wonders of the odorous      bulb. As for his homegrown product, Ted is unabashedly      proud: "I have the most beautiful stinking rose you've ever      seen!"-DM.    </p>    <h3>      Noel Johnson: Octogenarian Superman    </h3>        <p>      When Noel Johnson was 70 years old, doctors told him that      his heart was deteriorating and that he should therefore      avoid any strenuous activity. One doctor warned that even a      minor undertaking-such as trimming hedges-could      trigger a fatal heart attack. For more than 40 years,      Johnson had neglected his health-he drank, smoked      excessively, and paid little attention to his diet. But the      unhappy news from his physician put Noel on the offensive,      and he prepared to battle his way back to health.    </p>    <p>      Johnson gave careful thought to his diet: Seeds, nuts,      greens, and bee pollen soon replaced less nutritious fare.      Then, ignoring the medical advice he'd been given, Noel      started exercising. He was careful to start out      gradually-running only a city block or two at      first-so as not to overstress his weakened heart. But      before long he was running a mile.    </p>    <p>      After following his exercise program for a time, Noel began      to notice something: He was feeling better. In fact, he was      feeling really good. So he decided to increase his level of      activity. He took up boxing . . . and began to run      competitively in marathons.    </p>    <p>      Today, at 85, Johnson is a veteran of 13 New York City      Marathons and reigns as the World's Senior Citizen Box ing      Champion. He's also climbed Pikes Peak.    </p>    <p>      Recent medical evaluations have confirmed the benefits of      Noel's change in lifestyle. A doctor at a California      medical school described him as a "superman" and noted that      the octogenarian's improved physical condition "is evidence      that humans can increase their biological age with proper      eating, drinking, and activity." But Noel really didn't      need medical tests to determine that he's in excellent      health. "I have more vitality than I can use," he says,      "and I feel great." <em>-Rick      Lanning.</em></p>      <h3>In Brief . . .</h3>    <p>      Skier JIMMIE HEUGA, who won a bronze medal at the 1964      Olympic Games in Innsbruck, Austria, discovered in 1968      that he had multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis of his      condition was followed by several sedentary years, after      which Heuga decided to concentrate on developing a program      for "reanimating" his life. The former athlete is now      helping others with similar problems by devoting his time      to the Jimmie Heuga Center. The purpose of this nonprofit      organization is to "improve the quality of life of those      disabled by disease or trauma through goaloriented programs      of exercise, nutrition, and self-motivation."
