                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Part II    </h2>    <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us-for      instance-have read Paul's book</em> The Population      Bomb), <em>few people have any idea of how deeply the      Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research (the type that      tends to be published only in technical journals and      college texts). That's why we're pleased to present this      regular semitechnical column by these wellknown authors/      ecologists/educators.</em></p>      <h5 id="byline">by Anne and Paul Ehrlich</h5>    <p>      In our last column we discussed how the large herbivores in      the Serengeti ecosystem divide their food resources. Such      <em>resource partitioning is</em> not restricted to the      herbivores, though: The predators that feed on those      herbivores do it, too.    </p>    <p>      Lions (which weigh 200 to 400 pounds) feed primarily on      zebras and wildebeests when those migrating herbivores are      within their prides' territories, which can be found in      both the plains and the woodlands. The cats' prey among      <em>nonmigratory</em> ungulates includes buffalo (which no      other predator can kill) and giraffes, as well as warthogs      and antelope. Lions stalk their prey mostly at night and      sprint to catch their meals. Sometimes they hunt alone,      sometimes in small groups.    </p>    <p>      Another large cat of the Serengeti, the leopard (75 to 130      pounds), is confined to the woodlands and generally takes      smaller quarry than the lion does. At the uppermost end of      the size scale, the leopard's choice of prey (Thomson's      gazelles, topi, and an occasional zebra) overlaps that of      the lion, but the spotted cat feeds extensively on smaller      antelope such as Kirk's dik-dik (only 15" high at the      shoulder), small carnivores, hares, and birds. The leopard      is a solitary, nocturnal, stalk-and-sprint predator.    </p>    <p>      The cheetah is as large and heavy as the leopard, but is      much more slender. It hunts in the daytime, taking small      antelope and hares. After stalking, it can run down its      prey at speeds up to 60 mph. This cat, the classic      longdistance sprint predator, may chase its quarry as far      as 350 yards, whereas a lion will sprint no more than 50.    </p>    <p>      Hyenas hunt the plains at night and in the early hours of      the morning-in groups of one to three for wildebeests      and other antelope, and in packs of four to twenty for the      larger zebras. They are pursuit predators; that is, they      may harry their prey for up to two miles before finally      making the kill.    </p>    <p>      Wild dogs, the other Serengeti pursuit predators, take a      similar array of prey. They hunt mostly by day, with an      entire pack of two to nineteen dogs participating in chases      of a mile or more.    </p>    <p>      The pursuit predators concentrate more on attacking the      sick, wounded, or very old or young among their prey than      do the sprint predators.</p>      <h3>Scavengers and Decomposers    </h3>    <p>      Actually, there is relatively little competition for      <em>living</em> prey among predators, since each type has      its own food preferences, territories, and time of day to      hunt. Competition for <em>dead</em> prey is another matter,      however. Only cheetahs do not supplement their diet by      scavenging. Hyenas get about a third of their food that      way, lions 10% to 15%, leopards Solo to 10%, and wild dogs      about 3%.    </p>    <p>      Lions alone are not significantly interfered with by other      predators. But cheetahs lose 10% to 12% of their prey to      hyenas and (occasionally) lions; wild dogs lose about half      their kills to hyenas; and hyenas and leopards are thought      to lose 5% or more to lions.    </p>    <p>      The final major element in the Serengeti ecosystem is the      group of creatures that serve as decomposers. Many of these      lifeforms are similar to the decomposers in other      ecosystems: flies whose maggots help break down cadavers .      . . beetles that feed on hides or dung . . . and bacteria      and fungi' that do much of the fine work of reducing      organic compounds in dead plants and animals and in feces      to inorganic compounds.<br />      But the Serengeti ecosystem is unique in having a great      variety of <em>large</em> decomposers, including scavenging      predators-lions, leopards, hyenas, and wild dogs. These      animals (along with cheetahs, which eat only their own      kills) devour a third or more of the roughly 40,000 tons of      ungulates that die annually in the Serengeti.<br />      Of the remaining two-thirds of dead animal matter, half or      more is composed of soft tis sues. Nearly all of this is      consumed by the most abundant large decomposers in the      system: the marabou stork and seven species of vultures.      The remainder of the material is . consumed by insects,      other invertebrates, and bacteria.    </p>    <p>      Thus we can see the major outlines of the Serengeti system.      In a temporally and geographically varied, semi-arid      physical setting, energy and nutrients enter the system in      the form of grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees. This      vegetation supports an array of herbivores that includes an      unusual abundance and diversity of ungulates. And the      herbivores, in turn, sustain an equally sizable number of      large carnivorous predators. Finally, the decomposers make      their living on what remains of the available energy . . .      and return the nutrients to the soil, to complete the      cycle.    </p>    <h3>      Herbivore Social Systems    </h3>    <p>      Of course, this overview omits many important details that      influence the functioning of the system. We'll briefly      consider just one of them: How the combined selective      pressures of getting food and avoiding predators has helped      to shape the social systems of the hoofed herbivores.    </p>    <p>      Serengeti antelope, for instance, range in size from the      eight-pound dik-dik to the 1,500-pound eland. Dik-diks live      in pairs with their young on permanent territories (areas      defended against other dikdiks) in woodland with thick      cover. They communicate by scent marking, since calls or      visual displays would reveal their positions to predators.      Their territories, presumably, are large enough to contain      sufficient food at even the leanest time of year.    </p>    <p>      The tiny dik-diks have higher metabolic requirements per      unit of body weight than larger species have. As a result,      these animals must feed very selectively on tender young      leaves, buds, fruits, and seeds. Both the dik-diks' small      size and their need to search out special food items have      apparently led to natural selection against forming herds      for defense and have instead favored the practice of      territoriality.    </p>    <p>      In contrast, larger antelope, such as impalas, cannot be      quite so picky about their diets. A low-quality food intake      is mandated by their greater total food requirements and by      mouths too large to make fine discriminations among foods.      Impalas cannot remain hidden; they must move about to seek      the best grazing and browsing. Herds of up to a hundred or      more impalas seasonally shift their habitat preference.    </p>    <p>      About a third of the male impalas establish temporary      territories wherever the females are at the time; the rest      of the males form a bachelor herd. Members of an impala      herd benefit from group alertness and communication about      predators. In an attack, the entire herd reacts as a      coordinated unit.    </p>    <p>      Other antelope, such as waterbuck, kongoni, sedentary      populations of wildebeests, Grant's gazelles, and Thomson's      gazelles, have social systems with many of the same      features-especially the holding by males of spatially      defined territories within the region occupied by the      population at a given time, territories that are abandoned      when the herd moves on.    </p>    <p>      Migratory wildebeests have no spatially defined      territories. Instead, they set up tiny, temporary,      sometimes mobile territories wherever the females      are-defending them during the short rutting season.      This allows the males to maintain exclusive sexual access      to a group of females in spite of the need for constant      traveling in search of food.    </p>    <p>      Among buffalo, and perhaps among eland-the largest of      the antelope-a different system prevails. Both form      large herds that move a great deal. Rather than defending      territories, the males simply exercise individual dominance      on the spot to keep subordinate males away from any female      in estrus. Like the wildebeests, both the buffalo and the      eland males solve the problem of access to females simply      by staying with them. Neither of these species has a short      rutting period, so a brief defense of a group of females      would be to no avail; rivals for them must be      <em>perpetually</em> excluded.    </p>    <p>      Both buffalo and eland herds cooperate in the defense of      their young. Buffalo calves appear to be less able<br />      to fend for themselves than wilde-beest calves, and      attempts by males to cut out small groups of females from      the herd would expose the calves to predation.    </p>    <p>      The formation of cohesive groups by buffalo and other large      species is possible because of their ability to tolerate      low-quality food. The herd can sustain itself on abundant,      evenly distributed, relatively protein-poor food, such as a      field of grass. Therefore, the animals can stay together,      since they do not have to disperse to find food of higher      quality, which tends to grow in patches.    </p>    <p>      Thus we can see that the differences in social behavior      between different types of animals are linked to each kind      of creature's unique dietary needs and requirements for      self-preservation.    </p>    <p>      Now that you've been introduced to some of the intricacies      of the Serengeti ecosystem, in our next column we will      consider how that system reacts to disturbances-both      natural ones and those caused by humans.<br />      <br />      For more details on some of the animals of the Serengeti      ecosystem, see George Schaller's Golden Shadows, Flying      Hooves (University of Chicago Press, 1983) and A.R.
