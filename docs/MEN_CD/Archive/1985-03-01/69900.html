        <p>In the opening chapter of <em>Trout Fishing in America,</em> Richard Brautigan spoke of his stepfather, saying "he had a way of describing trout as if they were a precious and intelligent metal." And most anglers wouldn't feel that Brautigan was overstating the mystique of these members of the Salmonidae family. In fact, it's likely that more paeans have been written to trout - be they rainbows, browns, brookies, Dolly Vardens, goldens or any of the other various true trouts, chars or salmon - than to any other group of fishes.</p><p>Perhaps part of the charm, at least in many sections of the United States, is that trout season opens in the very early spring, making it the start of the angling year for great numbers of enthusiastic fisherfolk. In parts of New York State, for example, it's common to see men and women lined up elbow to elbow on opening day - despite the fact that snow often spots the spring fields and the still pools are likely to be rimmed with ice.</p><p>In addition to carrying the aura of legend, being sometimes almost heartbreakingly beautiful <em>and</em> having a well-deserved reputation as flashy and powerful fighters when hooked on tackle suiting their size, trout are also, in the minds of many people, one of the finest foods that swim. The following recipes, adapted from <em>Fresh Foods Country Cookbook,</em> are offered to help you celebrate the anglers' rite of spring with a delectable meal - whether your catch is the stuff of a streamside supper or the centerpiece of a full-scale sit-down banquet!</p><h3>Charcoal-baked Trout </h3><p><em>4 fresh trout (11 to 14 inches)<br />2 lemons (or 1 orange)<br />chopped fresh parsley<br />curry powder<br />salt and pepper to taste<br />4 tbsp butter</em> </p><p>Clean the trout and place four lemon wedges in the cavity of each fish. Sprinkle the inside of each with parsley, curry powder, and salt and pepper. Season the outside with salt and pepper and coat generously with butter. Wrap the fish individually in. heavy-duty aluminum foil, and once the charcoal fire has burned down to glowing embers, set the fish on the grill to cook for about 5 minutes on each side, or until the meat flakes easily. Serve garnished with a sprig of fresh parsley and more lemon wedges. Serves four.</p><h3>Beer-fried Trout</h3><p><em>2 lbs. filleted or pan-dressed trout<br />1 can warm beer<br />1 cup all-purpose flour<br />1/4 tsp garlic powder<br />1 tsp pepper (or to taste)<br />salt to taste<br />oil for frying</em></p><p>Mix the ingredients other than the fish and let stand 30 minutes at room temperature or until the beer flattens. Whisk the mixture until it's frothy and dip the fish in the batter. Heat the oil in the pan until it's hot and fry the fish about 1 minute on each side, or until the flesh flakes easily. Serves four.</p><h3>Broiled Trout</h3><p><em>1 lb. fillets<br />salt and pepper to taste<br />3 to 4 tbsp oil</em></p><p>Preheat the broiler. Cut the fillets into serving pieces, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grease the rack of a broiler pan, and place the fillets on the rack, skin side up. Brush with oil. Broil the fish for 5 to 8 minutes, about three inches from the heat, until they're brown. Baste with more oil. Turn, and baste the other side. Broil until brown. Serves four.</p>
