            		<p><strong>Homestead Handbook</strong></p>            <p>      Sheep, chickens, horses, pigs . . . if I could have only      one kind of homestead livestock, I'd choose honeybees. You      never have to muck out stalls of bee manure. You don't need      to keep their water trough thawed in subfreezing weather.      And - thank God - you don't have to get up in      the dark every morning before even a rooster goes off and      go out to pull on some bee udders. Members of <em>Apis</em>      <em>mellifera</em> can clean themselves, fetch their own      food and water, and store your harvest. They'll even patch      their home's leaks!    </p>    <p>      The fact that honeybees practically take care of themselves      is really only a small part of their appeal. Even the      golden sweetener they provide (which, like every other      homegrown product, is worlds better than its oversanitized      store counterpart) isn't what makes them irresistible to      me. The plain truth is I can no longer imagine my life      without those creatures and the fascination and respect      they engender. A honeybee colony is a mysterious and      independent creation. Bees haven't been bred and rebred      into docile egg machines or walking meat racks. They are as      wild today as when they were first imported into this      country. As a consequence, working with bees is a challenge      (and lesson) in cooperation, not domination... a rare      human-to-nature experience these days.    </p>                    <p>      But enough rhapsodizing. If you now keep bees, you're      probably already stricken with the obsession known as bee      fever. I'm going to address myself here to those who might      be <em>considering</em> beekeeping. If you're like I was a      few years ago, the two things holding you back are      ignorance and fear (nobody <em>wants</em> to get stung,      right?). Well, I'll try my best to help you start dealing      with both those factors. The books and the bees will teach      you the rest.    </p>    <h3>      Facts of Bee-oIogy    </h3>    <p>      Honeybees live in complex communities that may contain as      many as 100,000 members. The vast majority of these are the      unfertile females known as <em>workers.</em> And do they      <em>work.</em> They run the hive . . . feed and clean the      queen . . . gather nectar, pollen, and water (nectar gets      converted into carbohydrate-rich honey; pollen is used as      is for protein-rich "bee bread") . . . cool or heat the      hive, as needed . . . feed developing larvae . . .      <em>and</em> make the beeswax they use to build all the      hive's cells. During the peak of the season, a worker will      live only six weeks before she dies from exhaustion. She'll      have gathered enough nectar to make 1/12 of a teaspoon of      honey.    </p>    <p>      There are only a few hundred male, or <em>drone,</em> bees      in a hive. They don't work a lick. They just eat honey, fly      around, and look for an opportunity to mate. Such unions      occur rarely . . . when a week-old queen goes on her mating      flights high up in the air. It's then that the drones'      distinctive large eyes and big wings come into play, for      only the strongest males get to mate (passing on sperm that      the queen can keep alive inside her for years!). . . and      then fall to their - one hopes, blissful -      deaths. The unsuccessful suitors meet their doom in autumn:      No longer needed, they are forcibly evicted from the hive      by - who else? - the workers.    </p>    <p>      At the heart of the hive is its queen, the sole female bee      with fully developed reproductive organs. Indeed, all she      is, is a royal egg layer; she has absolutely no      decision-making authority. But what a layer! In the height      of the season, she can produce 1,500 eggs - more than      her own weight-in a single day.    </p>    <p>      The worker bees do treat her regally - they know the      hive's existence depends on having a healthy queen -      but as soon as she falters in her duties, they decide it's      time for a replacement. They'll pick out a few cells with      brand-new worker eggs, enlarge those cells to hold the      bigger queen bees . . . and then feed the chosen eggs a      diet consisting exclusively of royal jelly, a hormone- and      protein-rich substance that miraculously makes female      larvae develop into fertile adults. The workers will then      dispose of the old queen.    </p>    <p>      All this bee sociology is as relevant as it is intriguing.      Let's look at one of the "better beekeeping" conclusions      that can be drawn from what you've just learned. If a      single worker gathers only 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in      its entire lifetime, it must take a whole lot of bees to      give you a harvestable crop. Ergo, the number one rule of      productive beekeeping is to do everything you can to make      sure your hive is packed full of bees right at the time      when your area's good honeyflows are on (that is, when lots      of nectar-bearing flowers that bees like are in bloom). The      obvious but all-important fundamental for this? If you want      a lot of bees in your hive, you'd better have a healthy,      productive queen.    </p>    <h3>      OK, I Won't Do It Again.    </h3>    <p>      Hold on there a minute," you say. "Here you are telling me      how to increase production when I don't even have a hive      yet. I thought this article was supposed to be an      introduction!" Sorry, I got carried away. I tell you,      talking about honeybees is like that.    </p>    <p>      Back to basics, then. If you're going to keep bees, you'll      need a home for them. The modern beehive was invented by      Rev. L.L. Langstroth in 1851, and it was so simple and      ingenious that it's hardly been changed since. Before      Langstroth, most bee owners left their colonies in boxes,      hollow logs, or straw skeps. Once a year, the owner      gathered his or her harvest either by killing the bees and      taking all their honey . . . or by brusquely ripping out a      portion of the honeycomb (a procedure that didn't exactly      <em>please</em> the hive's inhabitants).    </p>    <p>      Langstroth's hive design made nondestructive manipulation      of the hive possible, because it incorporated two novel      features: movable frames and uniform bee space. All the      interior sections can be easily taken out and moved about.      These pieces are all separated by 5/16 of an inch, the size      of passageway honeybees naturally prefer, so the insects      won't stick the hive parts together with extra comb or      propolis (the tree-sap-derived "glue" they use for caulking      jobs).    </p>    <p>      With a modern beehive, then, you can harvest honey, search      for the queen, and even move bees and eggs from a strong      colony to a weak one - without damaging the hive or      angering the bees. Now, that's sweet!    </p>    <p>      Here's the layout. At the base is a bottom board, with a      little landing pad extension out front. On the hive's top      is an inner cover (a flat board with an oval opening) and      an outer cover (the real lid). In the middle of the hive      are open wood boxes called <em>supers.</em> The larger      ones, called the <em>deep</em> supers or <em>brood      chamber,</em> are stacked on the bottom and used for      raising eggs and larvae (brood). The smaller ones, called      the <em>shallow</em> supers or just plain <em>supers</em> ,      are used for storing honey. (Some beekeepers do use deep      supers for honey. The only drawback is weight: Full of      honey, a deep box weighs 60 pounds!)    </p>    <p>      Inside each super-deep or shallow-are ten <em>frames . . .      and</em> each of these removable rectangles contains a thin      sheet of beeswax that's been imprinted with little hexagons      the size of worker bee cells. Such sheets, called      <em>foundation,</em> give the bees ordered starting points      for drawing out either egg or honey cells.    </p>    <p>      You can build your own bee equipment (other than the wax      foundation), but don't . . . not when you're starting out.      Buy it knocked down from a bee supply company and tack it      all together (it's easy - even fun!). A one-hive      starter setup, including the hive parts you'll need,      smoker, hive tool, bee gloves, and hat and veil, will set      you back around $90. Then you'll have most everything      you'll need to get going, except for one thing . . . the      bees.    </p>    <p>      How do you get bees? There're three ways. You might catch a      wild spring swarm (a cluster of bees that have left their      hive and are temporarily hanging from a tree or bush).      Hiving a swarm is an exciting, glamorous beekeeping      adventure consisting of setting an empty hive under the      clustered bees and <em>shaking</em> them down into it. But      most folks would find that a bit unnerving for their      inaugural apicultural experience. (Psst: It's easier than      it looks. Swarms, being homeless, are often quite docile.)    </p>    <p>      You might be able to buy an established hive from another      beekeeper. This can be a good way to start out (it'll      probably cost from $50 to $100) . . . but don't buy a      colony that hasn't been formally inspected either by an      apiarist from your state department of agriculture -      it's free - or by someone you know who <em>knows</em>      bees. I did once, only to learn later that the bees had      American foulbrood, a contagious disease so dreaded I had      to kill all the bees and burn out the equipment!    </p>    <p>      The most common and reliable way of starting out is to      simply order your bees by mail. (That's right, the postal      service ships bees!) A three-pound box of packaged bees      will contain about 10,000 workers . . . one mated,      ready-to-start-laying queen . . . and some sugar water to      feed the small colony en route. (It'll set you back around      $30.) And if you give the folks at your post office your      phone number, they'll <em>gladly</em> call you when the      shipment arrives so you can promptly pick the bees up.    </p>    <p>      Installing the little crate of bees in an empty hive is a      simple operation that even a novice can handle. (I did it      <em>my</em> first year . . . and, believe me, I was a      novice!) Essentially - any beginning beekeeping book      has all the details - the procedure involves setting      the separately caged queen in your hive and then      <em>pouring</em> the other bees over her by shaking them      out of the crate like marbles! You won't get hurt (honest!)      . . . the travel-weary bees don't have a home to defend and      are flat-out discombobulated at this point, anyway.    </p>    <p>      A package colony will devote most of its energy during its      first season to building up enough numbers and stores to      last through the winter. So you probably won't get your own      honey harvest from it until year number two. That's the      disadvantage of starting with a package. One nice      advantage, though, is that you get to learn with a less      threatening number of bees. Your experience grows as the      colony does.    </p>    <h3>      Working Bees    </h3>    <p>      Have some of you been reading this article impatiently . .      . wondering when I was going to get around to the real meat      of the matter: going out and facing 50,000 armed insects      alone? If so, your wait is over. It's time to talk about      working bees.    </p>    <p>      Well, almost time. First, let me squeeze in a word of      advice. If you've never (or rarely) worked a colony of      honeybees, go out for a time or three with someone who      knows how to do it before you try it yourself. An      experienced beekeeper can show you tricks of the trade that      you'll never find in print. More important, that person      will have the hard-earned poise that can help calm those      anxious feelings you'll have... and will be able to show      you how you're <em>supposed</em> to behave around bees.    </p>    <p>      So just this once, <em>don't</em> be self-reliant. Call up      your local beekeeping society (your county extension agent      can put you in touch) and find out the name of a competent      hobby beekeeper who'd be willing to show you around his or      her backyard apiary.    </p>    <p>      You'd also be smart to have an interested (and, yes,      somewhat brave) friend accompany you the first few times      you work a hive yourself. When the human-to-honeybee odds      are 50,000 to 1, you can't help but be a little nervous...      and if you're too nervous, your actions may irritate the      bees. But somehow, if the odds are 50,000 to 2, you really      will feel a whole lot more comfortable. I guess it just      helps to have someone to talk to who doesn't buzz back.    </p>    <p>      OK, whether you're alone or with a friend, here's a      thumbnail sketch of what you do. Remember, if you      <em>cooperate</em> with those honey makers, you'll get back      from most hive visits without so much as a single sting. So      play the game on <em>their</em> terms:    </p>    <p>      [1] Visit the bees on a sunny day when nectar-bearing      plants are in bloom. Most of the bees will be out working      the flowers - and the rest will be too busy to worry      about you.    </p>    <p>      [2] Wear white or light-colored clothing (not wool). Tuck      your shirt into your pants and your pant legs into your      socks. Wear a hat, bee veil, and gloves. Don't wear perfume      or eau de barnyard (animal odors). And wash your beekeeping      outfit : regularly. If you don't, the residual odor of any      past bee stings will act as an attack alarm . . . and every      time you visit, you'll get stung more!    </p>    <p>      [3] Use a smoker - a little firebox-and-bellows rig      that's standard beekeeping equipment. You can start it up      on crumpled newspaper and then run it on dry grass, baling      twine, pine straw, wood shavings, or anything else that's      convenient and nontoxic.    </p>    <p>      Later, as you get more experience and confidence, you may      abandon some of those dictums. The day I first got up the      nerve to shed my bee gloves was the last day I wore them. I      found it a lot easier to work a hive smoothly bare-handed,      so I got stung less without gloves than I did with them!      Likewise, a good beekeeper can work most colonies in just      about any weather.    </p>    <p>      But no matter how cocky you get, <em>don't</em> abandon      that smoker. Smoke pacifies bees. They dive their heads      into honey cells and start gobbling up honey. I don't know      why . . . maybe the fumes make them think a forest fire's      coming and they'd better load up for a long escape trip!      But I do know that the one time I left that smoker behind I      collected ten years' worth of stings at once!    </p>    <p>      OK, you're all suited up. Your smoker's lit and burning      nicely (you might blow a few puffs on your hands and body      to help deodorize yourself), and you're hiveward bound.      Approach the colony from the side, so you don't get in the      way of foraging bees. Put the tip of the smoker in the hive      entrance and puff a few plumes. That'll cause a slight      stir, but they'll soon calm down.    </p>    <p>      After a moment's wait, lift off the hive's outer cover and      blow a little smoke down inside. Then, using your handy      hive tool - a little crowbar that's an indispensible      beekeeping aid - pry up the corners of the inner      cover and lift that off.    </p>    <p>      There they are, beautiful and busy! Smoke them down in the      super a bit, so you can pry out a frame and see what      they're up to. To do that, gently pry up the two corners of      an end frame with your hive tool and lift it out. Remember      to move deliberately and carefully around bees, because      quick, jerky movements are apt to excite them. Besides, you      don't want to crush any of those winged honey makers.    </p>    <p>      Frames in upper supers will either be empty or contain      honey, visible if uncured, and capped with lovely white      beeswax if ready for harvesting. To really learn what's      going on in the hive, though, you'll have to go below the      honey super and into the brood chamber, where the queen      lays her eggs. So, carefully reinsert that top frame you      took out (smoking the bees a bit to clear the way). Then      pry up the four corners of that super with your hive tool,      <em>twist</em> the super a bit to break any remaining bee      glue holding the supers together (don't forget the twist,      please, unless you want to risk yanking still-stuck-on      frames from below), lift the entire super off - it      may be heavy - and set it down on your inverted outer      cover.    </p>    <p>      Smoke the brood chamber. (You'll have to develop your own      feel for how much smoke to use. The best general rule I've      heard is when the bees start poking their heads back out      between the frames, it's time to smoke them down again.)      Pull out an end frame as you did before, hold it up, and      inspect both sides. Then set it down on end, so you'll have      more hive room to operate, push the next frame over with      your hive tool, pull it out, and hold it up. Before long,      if it's laying season and you have a good queen, you should      find several frames that are "slam full of brood" . . .      filled with large, oval patterns of brown-capped cells. If      you've got a number of those larvae-laden frames, as well      as some with open cells that - look <em>real</em>      closely - contain little white slivers (eggs) in      their bottom, you're in business. You've got a good queen      who's doing her job. You can reverse your sequence of      actions, close up the hive, and go home content.    </p>    <p>      You <em>can,</em> if you wish, find the queen by going      through every frame in the brood chamber, one by one.      Although it may seem impossible to spot that regal bee      amongst a horde of thousands, you'd be surprised how she      seems to jump out at you when you get the right frame.      (She's the one with the enlarged, bright abdomen who's      probably trying to scurry away.) As the old-timers in these      parts say, "You'll know her when you see her." But if      you're just doing a general health check on a colony, you      don't really need to find her. Her laying pattern will tell      you how things are.    </p>    <p>      Note: A lot of colony owners are reluctant to go down into      brood chambers. (.They're the kind that leave the bees      alone all year and timidly "rob" a super or two off the top      at the end of the summer, hoping the boxes contain      <em>something.)</em> They're called <em>bee-havers.</em> If      you want to be able to help your colony, to control the      quality of its queen, to increase honey harvests - in      other words, to become a bee <em>keeper</em> - you're      going to need to be willing to work that brood. So get down      in there.    </p>    <p>      Oh - or rather, Ow! - suppose you do get stung.      Don't jerk your hand back and drop the frame you had . . .      that's asking for more trouble. Instead, slowly and      carefully follow these "ancient beekeeping secrets": [1]      Promptly <em>scrape</em> the stinger out with your      fingernail or hive tool, and you'll get so little poison      you may not swell a bit. If you try to grab it, you'll      actually squeeze extra venom into your system. [2] Smoke      the spot. A stinging bee releases a banana-scented      pheromone to alert its comrades to attack the same area.      (Folks who don't smoke their stings often wonder why more      and more bees keep popping the same spot!)    </p>    <p>      See, that wasn't bad, was it? Admit it, actually you found      the whole thing a bit thrilling! <em>That's</em> the first      tingle of bee fever.<br />      <br />      <strong>Questions and Answers<br /></strong><br />      Let's take a moment to answer a few common beekeeping      questions.    </p>    <p>      <em>Where can you keep bees?<br /></em> Anywhere enough      nectar-bearing flowers grow. If other people are keeping      bees in your area, you probably can, too. If no one is      (unless you live in an untapped suburb or city), there's      probably not enough forage available.    </p>    <p>      <em>Where do you put colonies?<br /></em> Many urban      beekeepers put their hives on their rooftops, out of the      way of pedestrians. People with hives in crowded      neighborhoods keep them out of sight, preferably behind a      bush or barrier so the insects will have to fly up a few      feet to head out foraging. (Other hints for backyarders:      Keep a gentle breed of bees . . . make sure they have a      water source on <em>your</em> property... work hard to      reduce swarming... and after your first harvest, take your      neighbors some gifts of honey and explain to them how      innocuous your bees have been.)    </p>    <p>      In a rural area, choose a site that has some ventilation      (no muggy frost pockets, but no windy hilltops, either).      Ideally, it should be exposed to the sun in the morning (to      get the bees going) but shaded in the afternoon (so they      can spend less energy cooling). Also, put your first hives      where you can observe them often and easily - you'll      learn and enjoy a lot more that way.    </p>    <p>      <em>How much time does beekeeping take?<br /></em> Once you      know what you're doing, you can maintain a few healthy,      established hives in just a few hours a year. (Or you can      be smitten with a severe case of bee fever and spend every      spare minute in your beeyard!) The busiest times are      spring, when you try to make sure your hive is strong but      not about to swarm, and harvest, which takes place at the      end of your area's main honeyflows. Other than those, an      occasional inspection or trip to add more supers should be      just about all that's needed.    </p>    <p>      <em>How do you harvest honey?</em><br />      To get it away from the bees, you can just brush them off      each frame you're after. (Try it - it works!) A soft,      no-animal-hair brush - like an artist's drafting      brush - is best.    </p>    <p>      At the hobby level, the best way to go is to set a bee      escape (a dandy one-way exit that you can put in the oval      hole of the inner cover) under the supers you want to      harvest, go away for a day or two, and then come back to an      almost completely bee-free harvest. (Two cautions: Tape any      cracks above the escape, or other bees may well harvest the      honey before you do. And bee escapes don't work well in      real hot weather.)    </p>    <p>      Commercial beekeepers use blower guns or chemical      repellants to evict bees from supers. Don't bother.    </p>    <p>      <em>But how do you get the honey out of the      frames?</em><br />      Oh, <em>that's</em> what you were asking! There are two      ways to do that: Either cut the honey out in comb chunks      with a pocketknife or cut just the caps off all the sealed      cells and <em>spin</em> the liquid honey out in a special      centrifuge called a honey extractor. Extractors do increase      yields because they leave the honey cells intact. But they      also cost $170 and up: more than the rest of your start-up      expenses put together! So don't start out with one. (MOTHER      ran plans for an inexpensive homemade model in issue 68,      page 170. I'll vouch that it works great, because I      "retest" it every summer!)    </p>    <p>      Instead, just cut comb sections out with a sharp knife, and      carve off thin slivers of those to spread on toast,      biscuits, and pancakes. This <em>is</em> the most delicious      way to enjoy honey. If you want some liquid-with-no-beeswax      honey too, cut the comb out; "pop" all the cells with a      kraut chopper, hand-held egg beater, or something similar;      and set the squashings up in a sieve to drain out your      harvest. Heat and cool the remaining glob in a double      boiler, and it will separate into solid wax (which you can      use or sell) and some additional honey.    </p>    <p>      Note: Since extracting puts stress on bee equipment, if you      do want to extract you'll have to use special thick, wired      foundation in your frames. On the other hand, since you      want to be able to eat comb honey, you start that off on      thin, nonwired foundation.    </p>    <p>      <em>How much honey will you get?</em><br />      If you're in a good beekeeping area, if the weather's great      that year, and if your bees do well, you can get 100-200      pounds (30-60 gallons) or even more from one hive! Not me.      Where I live - an area where woodland trees are the      main nectar sources - my hives probably average 50      pounds each . . . which, by the way, is the national      average. (That includes the really lousy year when I may      not get any.) In most places, two hives - a good      number to start with - should give you all the honey      you can use and some extra to give away (or sell).    </p>    <p>      <em>Can you make money from beekeeping?</em><br />      Yes, some. Don't expect a full-time income. A commercial      beekeeper owns at least 500 hives and drives them all over      the place to pollinate crops.    </p>    <p>      But you <em>can</em> make some sideline money from bees.      Say you sell your honey for about a dollar a pound. If you      hit the national average, you'll earn $50 per hive (not      counting expenses). Most beekeepers don't keep more than      20-25 hives in one yard (they may have several outyards on      other people's property). So you may earn $1,000 or more      from each beeyard. The more hives you have, though, the      more investment and work will be required. And please,      don't try to expand past a few hives until you've kept bees      several years and have gotten over the first      overenthusiastic flush of bee fever.    </p>    <p>      <em>How do you prevent swarming?</em><br />      Swarming - the departure of many or most of a      colony's bees with the old queen, leaving behind the other      bees and some new queen cells - can cripple a hive's      honey production, but it's the way <em>colonies</em> per se      reproduce. You can't prevent it. There are scores of      intricate methods for <em>reducing</em> swarming. In      essence, though, colonies that are overcrowded or have      older queens are more likely to swarm. So give your      colonies plenty of space in the spring. And consider      requeening your hives every other year - it cuts      swarming in half. (Requeening entails killing the old      monarch and, a day later, installing a caged, new -      probably mailordered - one. It's a bit tricky, but      not <em>too</em> tricky.)    </p>    <p>      <em>What if you have a really mean hive of bees?</em><br />      It happens. Some colonies <em>are</em> more aggressive than      others. Often, the meanest bees gather the biggest      harvests, so you may choose to frown and bear it. If they      bother you (or your neighbors) too much, you can solve the      problem in one fell swoop . . . by requeening. A more      docile queen will lay more docile eggs, and in six weeks      you'll have an entire hive of more docile bees. The one      hitch to this scheme is you'll have to work your way down      through the brood chamber of your nasty colony so you can      find the old queen and kill her. (Bundle up!)    </p>    <p>      <em>What are some common beekeeping problems?</em><br />      Pesticides. A lot of people lose bees because farmers or      gardeners spray the flowers of crops that bees work.      Educate your neighbors to spray only in the late afternoon      (or not use pesticides on any blooms): What's good for your      flying pollinators is good for the crops. (Sevin is a      common bee killer; BT is safe.)    </p>    <p>      Diseases. There are a few honeybee ailments, the worst of      which is American foulbrood. (Your bees have got this      larval fungus if the hive smells foul and a matchstick      poked into a brood cell comes out gooey, as if there were      gum on it, instead of clean.) You have to destroy infested      colonies - it's the law - to keep the disease      from infecting other hives. To avoid the problem, buy only      inspected, clean bees and equipment. There are some      antibiotic preventives available, but don't use them unless      you've had a prior foulbrood problem.    </p>    <p>      Winterkills. A good number of colonies starve each winter,      primarily because their owners didn't leave enough honey in      the hive to last until the following spring flows      <em>(not</em> just until the end of winter: Lots of      colonies starve each March). So don't get too greedy.      Always leave plenty of honey - 30 to 90 pounds,      depending on the length of your winter - for the      bees. You'll save yourself a lot of sorrow or, at the      least, time and hassle syrup-feeding your bees.    </p>    <p>      Allergy. Most people develop an immunity to bee venom after      repeated periodic "exposure." (The sting itself still      smarts.) A few go the other way and develop serious      <em>nonlocal</em> reactions. If you become highly allergic      to bee venom, you may be risking your life the next time      you're stung. See an allergist for immunotherapy (it costs,      but it works) or give up beekeeping.    </p>    <h3>      So Long!    </h3>    <p>      That's all the information and opinions I can cram into one      article. If you're game, get ahold of some of the listed      resources, work a hive with somebody who knows how, buy a      colony or two, and get cracking: Spring is the time to      start!    </p>    <p>      I don't think you'll regret it. There's nothing like      walking out to the yard on a late May afternoon and      watching the bees on a bottom board (those on one side      facing out, on the other facing in) fervently fanning air      through the hive to drive the water out of their fresh,      uncured honey. You stick your nose down near the exit side      (the bees don't care), smell the unmatched aroma of honey      in the making, and grin with tickled contentment . . .      because, at last, the goods are in the woods.    </p>    <p>      I wouldn't give it up for anything.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The author made a 26-minute video cassette      on introductory beekeeping called "Sweet Rewards" that was      originally used in classes at MOTHER's Eco-Village. This      tape won't tell you anything you can't read in this      article, but it does show you quite a bit, including      inspecting a hive, installing a package colony, and even      shaking a swarm into a new hive.
