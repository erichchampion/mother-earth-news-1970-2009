                <p>      Advice and Observations on on John Victor's Problems    </p>		<p>      <em>To help acquaint you with the trials and tribulations      that often accompany the joys and triumphs of pursuing a      self-sufficient life in the country, here's one      back-to-the-lander's tongue-in-check account.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by John Victor    </h5>    <p>      Being blessed, as I am, with several years' worth of      hands-on experience in committing just about every      homesteading blunder imaginable, I figure it's my      neighborly duty to share this great wealth of knowledge      with my fellow MOTHER EARTHers.    </p>    <p>      Let's start at the beginning, with a few words on . . .    </p>    <h3>      SELECTING A HOMESTEAD    </h3>    <p>      One factor should always be kept in mind when shopping for      your prospective back-to-the-land land: No matter what size      parcel you choose, it's going to be either too big or too      small.    </p>    <p>      Our first homestead was a humble acre and a half-on      which we raised (more or less simultaneously) two gardens,      three hogs, forty chickens, two cows, and two hives of      bees, plus assorted pheasants, cats, dogs, and children . .      . all in full view of two stunned but understanding      neighbors.    </p>    <p>      But we did make a pretty good go of it, and without too      much stink (literally). Of course, there <em>were</em>      problems. For instance, we purchased feed for all those      critters from the local Agway store, making our enterprise      something less than profitable. (In fact, Agway flew its      flag at half-mast for three days when we moved away.) Our      gardens, however, became local legends: Organic fertilizer      grows unbelievably robust weeds.    </p>    <p>      As soon as we realized that the place was too small to      support our plans for self-sufficiency, we sold it to a      family with four kids and an aged grandmother. (They were,      last -we heard, busily acquiring double the stock we had      and were "free-ranging" dozens of chickens on the thick,      wine red pile carpet we painstakingly installed in the      dining room during a fit of homesteading extravagance.)    </p>    <p>      Best of luck to them.    </p>    <p>      As for too <em>big</em> , well, we now have ten acres with      a stream, a huge barn, several smaller outbuildings, and a      house that's three times the size of our previous shanty.      And to the menagerie we brought with us from the first      homestead, we've added six horses and a Scottish deerhound.    </p>    <p>      It's glorious having all that space to roam around in while      admiring the workings of nature. In the summer, for      instance, I get to take a daily stroll to the absolute      farthest corner of the pasture to get the cows in for      milking and check the fences. It's usually an invigorating      90Â° out, the pasture grass is a joy to feel under my      feet (it's generally a luxurious four feet high), and the      mosquitoes are so enormous that they have to take off and      land at the local airport.    </p>        <p>      Our chickens enjoy the extra room as well. In fact, I can      rarely find them (or their eggs) in their lofty roosts      among the beams and rafters of the three-story chicken coop      (which local old-timers say once housed a flock of several      <em>thousand</em> layers).    </p>    <p>      We're blessed with an abundance of mature trees on our      property-more than enough to keep our woodpile fat.      Unfortunately, every time one of them dies, it manages to      fall across a new fence that I spent weeks stringing.    </p>    <p>      So much for selecting a homestead . . . now on to a      discussion of some of the <em>specifics</em> of this      lifestyle.    </p>    <h3>      MONEY    </h3>    <p>      One of the greatest mysteries facing novice homesteaders is      the question of where to get the money to buy all the      things needed in order to become self-sufficient.    </p>    <p>      Books are full of money-making ideas, of course . . . such      as the rabbitry one expert blithely states can be started      on a "shoestring budget" of only a couple of grand. Another      piece of thrifty homestead wisdom advocates eliminating      electric bills by setting up a "low-cost,      build-it-yourself" wind-generated power plant . . . at a      cost of several thousand bucks. I was also pleased to be      informed that <em>hydroelectric</em> power is available to      any homesteader who happens to own a 20-foot waterfall and      has the financial resources to build a miniature replica of      Hoover Dam.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, for those of us whose total homestead income      is derived from selling an occasional rabbit, a dozen eggs,      or a quart of honey, such "low-cost" self-sufficiency      schemes are as out of reach as buying the World Trade      Center would be.    </p>    <p>      It is, of course, totally feasible to start out small and      accumulate the necessities over time . . . as long as you      don't mind starving and freezing in the dark while you do      so.    </p>    <h3>      HOMESTEAD ANIMALS    </h3>    <p>      The first rule of homestead livestock raising is that no      matter which breeds of animals you choose to raise in order      to provide your food, by the time you buy the critters,      then feed and raise them to maturity, you could purchase      the same animals at the supermarket - dressed out and      ready to eat - for less money.    </p>    <p>      Of course, this rule fails to take into account the joy of      killing the 1-1/2-year-old, two-pound turkey that's been      organically grown and had its feed and water carried to it      by you personally each day of its life, even in subzero      weather.    </p>    <p>      Now let's take a look, one species at a time, at a few of      the more popular varieties of homestead livestock and      discuss how each of them fits into the self-sufficiency      scheme.    </p>    <h3>      MILK COWS    </h3>    <p>      We got our two milk cows as calves by bartering labor      (mine) to a friend who happens to be a dairy farmer. I      tenderly carried them home in my lap (two trips) and      experienced the agrarian bliss of having both of the little      darlings go potty thereupon.    </p>    <p>      Maybe that early TLC accounts for the fact that now, as      adult cows, they follow me around like puppies . . . except      when it's time to milk. Then, neither of the stubborn      creatures can be coaxed into the barn with anything less      than the persuasive power of a bulldozer.    </p>    <p>      But milk we do have. In fact, those two bossies provide      enough to fatten a battalion of babies. So, naturally, both      of our children have developed an aversion to any milk      other than that which comes from the supermarket. But, of      course, there are more things to do with milk than drink      it, so we've also got yogurt and cheese coming out of our      ears. And we've got plenty of home-churned butter,      too-which the kids also won't touch. (Strangely      enough, though, when I make <em>ice cream,</em> it goes      like Grant taking Richmond.)    </p>    <p>      All in all, counting the $600 automatic milker we purchased      to save time (I don't care what anyone      says-hand-milking two cows in a freezing barn at 5 AM      is <em>not</em> a part of "the good life"), I figure that      the milk we've gotten so far has cost us about $10 per      gallon. But on the plus side, at least I know where it      comes from: In fact, I can see the two contented,      spoiled-rotten beasts lying out there under a pine tree      right this minute, chewing cud and anticipating their next      gourmet treat of store-bought grain.    </p>    <h3>      CHICKENS    </h3>        <p>      Our hens have brought a great deal of excitement to our      lives over the years. One particularly memorable experience      was the time our entire flock of 40 layers went on strike,      producing a grand total of three eggs in three weeks. (The      chicken-feed bill for that same three weeks was $12; you do      the math.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, we finally got them straightened out and laying      again . . . just about the time the kids developed an      aversion to-you guessed it-eggs. (They prefer      Cheerios for breakfast.)    </p>    <p>      Sure, I could let them out to roam free and peck around in      the dirt for bugs in order to cut down on the feed bill      (the chickens, not the kids). But everything predatory in      this world eats chickens, and the pea-brained birds are      stupid enough to <em>!et</em> everything eat them. Hence,      what I might save in feed bills by free-ranging my hens      would more than likely be offset by the increased mortality      rate.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if one can identify the nonlayers, he or she can      always thin and improve the flock, relegating the      nonproductive birds to the freezer . . . even if layers      <em>aren't</em> as fat, tender, and tasty as pullets.    </p>    <h3>      RABBITS    </h3>    <p>      Rabbits are, according to the experts, far and away the      most efficient animals you can have around a homestead when      it comes to feed-to-meat cost ratios. Best of all, domestic      bunnies typically breed like . . . well, like rabbits.    </p>    <p>      <em>Our</em> does, however, have sworn a vow of chastity.      The books say to take the doe to the buck at breeding time,      so she won't feel that her territory has been invaded and      thus make war rather than love. Well, theories are      wonderful things. But in practice, our does are exceedingly      virtuous while also excelling in the art of pugilism; they      routinely beat our poor buck to a pulp.    </p>    <p>      So once again, I turned to the literature for advice. In      one book I read that it's sometimes necessary to physically      restrain a frigid doe in order to make life easier for the      buck. The book neglected to mention, however, that said doe      might not take kindly to this idea and, in defense of her      virtue, might feel compelled to sink her chisel-like teeth      into the would-be restrainer's metacarpal if said      restrainer is too stupid to wear heavy leather gloves. I      was and she did.    </p>    <p>      We presently have the oldest maiden rabbits in the county      and a buck that could profit from a visit to a Masters and      Johnson clinic.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOGS<br /></strong><br />      I don't even want to talk about it.    </p>    <h3>      HORSES    </h3>    <p>      None of the experts recommend keeping horses on a homestead      unless you can afford the luxury. But considering the luck      I'd had with the experts' advice in the past, I figured      they were probably wrong about horses, too.    </p>    <p>      They weren't.    </p>    <p>      We have six of the hungry creatures, each of which delights      in munching everything in sight (except the yard-tall grass      in the pasture). One old mare that I made the mistake of      rescuing from the glue factory even eats my wife's      roses-thorns and all! Who needs goats?    </p>    <p>      I had hoped that, at the least, the kids would ride and      enjoy the horses, even if I couldn't get the lazy beasts to      pull a plow (the horses, not the kids). Wrong again.      Overall, the horses are pampered boarders here, eating and      sleeping and generally getting fat.    </p>    <h3>      CATS, DOGS, AND KIDS    </h3>    <p>      These three types of critters are almost as useless as the      horses. They eat, drink, take up space, get sick, make rude      noises, and contribute little or nothing in the way of      income or labor.    </p>    <p>      Except for the cats, that is. I'll have to admit that our      homestead feline population does a spectacular job of      mousing: We haven't lost so much as one kernel of grain to      a rodent of any kind to date. Of course, the cats also do a      phenomenal job of <em>getting pregnant.</em> (Perhaps I      should have them teach the rabbits about the birds and      bees?) In fact, if the current trend in rampant      kitty-littering continues, I'll have to <em>import</em>      some mice to help feed the burgeoning pride.    </p>    <p>      The dogs are, well . . . <em>interesting</em> <em>.</em>      Our deerhound is fiercely territorial. That would be fine,      I guess, except that he thinks his territory includes most      of the county, and is constantly attempting to prove it by      venturing out on raiding parties against our neighbors'      pets.    </p>    <p>      Our other dogs specialize in chasing and catching      things-like groundhogs, snakes, chickens, rabbits,      geese . . . always, it seems, eventually working up to      cars. (Usually, catching just <em>one</em> car cures the      offender of this annoying habit. But by then we've got to      get a replacement dog, and the process starts all over      again.)    </p>    <p>      Kids, of course, deserve special consideration when      discussing homestead life. No matter what you think your      back-to-the-land land might add to the wee ones' lives in      the way of pure romping pleasure and communion with nature,      my experience says it won't. For instance, back on our      cramped acre-and-a-half place, the little lovelies were      always out of doors and underfoot. Now, with ten beautiful      acres to play in, it takes a crowbar and a mule to get them      out of the house. (Except when it's raining or snowing, of      course.)    </p>    <p>      We also have a clear, shallow stream on our land, in which      they refuse to swim or wade (they want a clean, chlorinated      pool) and multitudinous animals they refuse to help care      for or even acknowledge . . . except when I'm about to put      one of them in the freezer (the animals, not the kids), at      which time said critter suddenly becomes their most      treasured pet.    </p>    <p>      Yep, my kids are natural-born contrarians.    </p>    <h3>      LABOR    </h3>    <p>      It takes more than animals a successful homestead to make      - there's also a lot of hard work involved.      Generally, homestead labor can be divided into two broad      categories: yours and theirs.    </p>    <p>      Your labor is a sure thing; you know you'll be there to      milk, feed, water, and weed. (After all, there's not much      of a way out of it.)    </p>    <p>      For homesteaders on a budget (as most are), "their" labor      is limited to what work can be bartered for or bought on      the cheap from local, honest crafts people. Honest such      folks generally are. But crafts people, well-I'm      reminded of the fellows who installed our storm windows and      expertly glued all the sliding panels fast to the frames,      so that the windows couldn't be opened. This same skilled      local help also managed to install the double-front storm      doors backward. And now they want to put new siding on our      house.    </p>    <p>      But I've learned: It's caveat emptor, even out here in the      country.    </p>    <p>      The neighbors are a big help, of course. For example, they      never fail to keep us informed of what we're doing -      like the time we drove in with two geese in the back of the      truck and immediately received several phone calls to the      tune of "See you got two new geese." Then there was the      time when, in an attempt to maintain a shred of privacy, we      arranged to have our new coal-burning heater delivered in      the middle of the night. But no good; the callers even knew      what <em>brand</em> it was.    </p>    <p>      And this isn't even <em>Vermont!</em>    </p>        <h3>      GARDENS    </h3>    <p>      Every homestead must have at least one garden -      preferably a large one so that the local fauna won't      starve. Yes, pests <em>are</em> a problem for many country      gardeners. And the farther out in the boonies you are, the      more of a problem they're likely to be.    </p>    <p>      In the beginning, I thought I could learn to coexist      peacefully with four-legged garden robbers. But they were      getting more of the fruits (and vegetables) of our labor      than <em>we</em> were, so I had to escalate to      live-trapping the repeat ofenders and releasing them      several miles away.    </p>    <p>      Well, that didn't make even so much as a dent in the      problem (the beasts seemed to have been equipped with      built-in homing devices), so now I discourage the greedy      little thieves with 55 grains of lead launched from a      22-250 Remington varmint rifle.    </p>    <p>      Many of you, no doubt, are thinking that shooting garden      pests is a bit of a drastic measure. Well, you might feel      differently if you had watched in awe, as my wife and I      did, while a woodchuck ambled insouciantly down a row of      ripening tomatoes, taking one-just <em>one</em>      -bite from a fruit on <em>each</em> and      <em>every</em> plant. If he could have only found it in his      heart to contain his munching to just a <em>few entire</em>      tomatoes-rather than vandalizing the whole      crop-he might not have become an <em>ex</em>      -groundhog.    </p>    <p>      Wild rabbits often get the same treatment. After all, it's      <em>my</em> lettuce, beet tops, carrots, and chard they're      feasting on. And yes, I tried fences, dried blood, coyote      urine, lion droppings, and all the other faddish      garden-pest deterrents. But after watching what was to have      been the winter's produce supply rapidly disappearing into      the insatiable maws of various pests, and after tallying up      the mounting expenses of humane deterrence, I was forced to      opt for the much more affordable cost of reloading my own      rifle shells.    </p>    <h3>      WHY BOTHER?    </h3>        <p>      After having suffered through all those misadventures (and      more), you may well be wondering why we've stuck with      homesteading rather than return to the more comfortable and      less physically demanding life of the city.    </p>    <p>      A good question . . . for which there are many, many      answers.    </p>    <p>      As I write this, I'm satisfyingly sore from a ten-mile      horseback ride a friend and I took last night, stopping      along the way to pass the time with various neighbors.      (Yes, they're very nice folks-in spite of their      curiosity.)    </p>    <p>      When I look up from the typewriter and out the window, I'm      greeted with a tranquil scene of horses grazing in one      corner of the big pasture, while our two milk cows lie      contentedly in the shade, moving only enough to chew cud      and flick their tails occasionally.    </p>    <p>      Closer to the house, a swarm of swallows is putting on a      display of avian aerobatics, darting in and out of the      barn, while down by the brook a brown crane is perched on a      log, hungrily eyeing the sleek, silvery fish flitting about      in the clear water.    </p>    <p>      In the freezer there's a gallon of fresh, homemade      strawberry ice cream, and the pantry holds jugs of the best      maple syrup I've ever tasted. Last night's pork spareribs      and this morning's sausage and eggs are pleasant memories,      and I'm anticipating yet another homegrown feast this      evening.    </p>    <p>      After dinner, my wife and I will stroll together out to the      henhouse to hunt up the daily bounty of fresh eggs, then      check to see if there's any money in the      eggs-and-honey-for-sale "honor box" out by the road. Then      tomorrow we'll decide which turkey, goose, or hog will be      the guest of honor at next Sunday's dinner.    </p>    <p>      And our daughters-bless their sweet little      hearts-are growing up straight and strong and free of      all the competitive, materialistic influences they'd be      exposed to in big-city schools and the overcrowded mazes      that pass for urban "neighborhoods."    </p>    <p>      No, I wasn't kidding about or exaggerating (well, not      <em>too</em> much, anyway) any of the problems we've had to      deal with while stumbling through the first few years of      our homesteading career. But there are problems involved      with learning to do most <em>anything</em> that's worth the      doing.    </p>    <p>      That's why, on the rare occasions when my wife and I get      frustrated enough to start considering alternatives to      homesteading, it never takes us more than a moment to      regain our determination to stick with the rural, agrarian      lifestyle we've come to love so much . . . hardships,      frustrations, botches, and all.    </p>
