    <p>
                    <p>      When you work for two employers and receive two W-2's, tax      form preparation isn't substantially different from the      (ahem) simple case we just finished looking at. But there      are some considerations that may lessen the tax you pay.    </p>    <p>      First of all, if you worked for two employers who paid you      a total of more than $37,800 in 1984, there's a good chance      that excess social security (FICA) was withheld from your      pay. Check to see that no more than a total of $2,532.60      was withheld; just add up the amounts on the line marked      FICA on your W-2's. The excess may be taken as a credit on      line 61, Form 1040.    </p>    <p>      Commuting to your second job (or second job location with      the same employer) from the first job is a deductible      expense on Form 2106-for itemizers and nonitemizers      alike. This deduction has been complicated somewhat,      however, by specific IRS rulings. For example, the service      judges that the principal place of business for a doctor is      both his or her office <em>and</em> the hospital. Hence      travel between isn't deductible. In addition, traveling      from a union hall to a job site isn't deductible.    </p>    <p>      If you have two jobs in different cities or general areas,      the question becomes, What is your principal place of      business? The entire city or general area of your principal      place of business is called your tax home (as opposed to      your residence) by the IRS, and the location of this base      can have profound effects on your taxes. For example, if      you work in two places that are so far apart that you have      to spend some nights sleeping at each location, you may be      able to deduct living expenses at the location that is not      your tax home. The location of your tax home is determined      by comparing (a) the amount of time spent working in each      area, to (b) the degree of your business activity in each      area, to (c) the amount of income you earn in each area.    </p>    <p>      This could lead to a situation where your residence is not      your tax home. If, for example, your main employment is in      a distant city, that's your tax home even though you travel      to your residence each weekend to be with your family. In      this case, the IRS would consider your residence to be      maintained for personal convenience. But (to stretch this      hypothetical situation one step further) let's say you      happen to have minor employment in the area of your      residence. Now you can deduct both your travel expenses      from your tax home to your residence area and also your      living expenses while there-including your part of      the costs of maintaining the household. Thus a portion of      your home and expenses while there become deductible. On      the other hand, you may not deduct any living expenses for      being in the area of your tax home.    </p>    <p>      Another peculiar situation for a tax home occurs when a      worker is on the road constantly. The IRS agent may      consider that such a person has no tax home and therefore      can't deduct expenses for business travel away from home.      There are three main criteria for establishing a tax home      in this case: (a) Some work is done in the vicinity of the      person's residence. (b) Rent is paid on the residence even      when the person is on the road. (c) The residence is in an      area where the person was raised or has lived for some      time, or a family member lives in the area.    </p>    <p>      If you and your spouse work in different locations, bear in      mind that you may have different tax homes, even if you      file a joint return.    </p>    <p>      What if you're assigned a temporary position by your      employer at a distant location? In order to maintain that      your original tax home continues as your tax home,      therefore making your travel and living expenses while on      assignment deductible, you'll have to prove that the      assignment was for a known limited length of time (less      than one year in one recent tax case), and that you've      maintained your original residence. Having a family at the      original residence (and tax home) is an important      criterion.    </p>    <p>      You'll save enough for property in the country sooner not      only by holding two jobs to bring in more income but also      by paying close attention to taxes.    </p>    <h3>      Where to Get IRS Forms and Publications    </h3>    <p>      <em>For free IRS materials, write to your area Forms      Distribution Center.

Each year's      percentage is set by the IRS.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Accrual accounting:</strong> An accounting system      wherein income and expenses are listed at the time of      service, not of payment. Under accrual, you count income      you've earned but not yet received and expenses you've      incurred but not yet paid bills for. You can't switch      methods of accounting without permission from the IRS.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Adjusted gross income:</strong> The amount of your      total income that remains after adjustments-such as      moving expenses, employee business expenses, IRA or Keogh      payments, penalties for early savings withdrawals, alimony      paid, deductions for married couples with both working, and      disability income exclusion-are subtracted. This      amount must be reported on line 33 of Form 1040 and      precedes either itemized deductions or the standard      exclusion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Allocation:</strong> A process wherein an expense      is divided between two situations. One part may be      deductible while the other isn't. For example, a portion of      the total cost of driving your personal automobile may be      deductible as a business expense: The total cost of driving      the car is allocated.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Amortization:</strong> A process similar to      depreciation wherein income (such as bonds bought at      discount) or expense (such as business startup costs) is      spread over several tax years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Basis:</strong> The cost from which profit is      figured on the sale of property. Basis in a house, for      example, is the amount originally paid plus capital      improvements-minus depreciation allowed or taken.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Capital gain and loss:</strong> The profit or loss      from property held for investment is figured by capital      gain. Gains or losses from property held less than six      months are considered short-term and are fully taxable or      deductible (from other gains). Property sold after more      than six months is long-term, and gain or loss is reduced      to 40% of the amount.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Credit:</strong> Tax credits are deducted from the      amount of tax paid, not from income. They are taken on      lines 41 through 50 of Form 1040.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Deductions:</strong> Expenses declared on Schedule      A by individual taxpayers and Schedule C by the      self-employed. These may involve certain personal or      employee-related costs. The alternative to itemizing      deductions is the standard deduction (called the zero      bracket amount).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Depreciation:</strong> A process by which a portion      of the value of property that will wear out, lose value, or      become obsolete may be deducted during each year of its      life. Accelerated cost recovery is a method of      depreciation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Earned income:</strong> Money earned by gainful      employment-as opposed to dividends, interest, or capital      gains.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Exclusion:</strong> Certain types or portions of      income may not be taxable. Exclusions are sometimes the      same as adjustments.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Exemption:</strong> A consideration of the number      of people dependent upon a taxpayer, including the      taxpayer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>First-year expensing:</strong> Up to $5,000 of the      cost of certain property bought for business use may be      deducted in the year purchased. Depreciation and investment      tax credit are alternatives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fiscal year:</strong> A 12-month accounting period      different from the calendar year. Taxes need not be filed      on the calendar year. A change of fiscal year must be      approved by the IRS.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gross income:</strong> Total income before any      adjustments or deductions are subtracted.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Imputed interest:</strong> On certain transactions      where no (or low) interest was charged (such as zero      interest loans to family members), the IRS will calculate      interest at the imputed rate, which is determined daily by      the service itself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Investment credit:</strong> 10% of the cost of      business property that will last five years or more may be      deducted in the year the equipment is purchased. Business      property that is figured to last three years (cars, for      example) entitles the purchaser to a credit equal to 6% of      the cost.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Recapture:</strong> If property that is being or      has been depreciated is sold for more than the basis in      that property (cost, plus capital improvements, minus      depreciation), the portion of the difference equal to the      depreciation deduction must be reported as ordinary income.      Thus the depreciation is recaptured. See special rules for      recapture of first-year expensing if property is held less      than two years and for investment tax credit if property is      held less than five years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Straight-line election:</strong> Property may be      depreciated by claiming an equal percentage of its cost in      each year of its life. For example, five-year property      would be claimed at a rate of 20% each year, assuming that      the property was put into service on January 1 of the first      year of depreciation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Zero bracket amount:</strong> The name the IRS uses      for its alternative to itemizing deductions. (This formerly      was called the standard deduction.) If you do not itemize,      this amount is figured into the tax table you use. If you      do itemize, the zero bracket amount must be subtracted from      your total itemized deductions on Schedule A.    </p>
