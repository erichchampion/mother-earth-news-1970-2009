                <p>      Here's the eleventh in a series of articles that will help      you tell friend from foe in your garden.    </p>        <h3>      Part XI: Aphid Biology</h3>      <h5 id="byline">by Ron West</h5>                <p>      Most gardeners would be quick to name aphids as the insects      that give them the most trouble. Few other pests are as      widespread, persistent, and downright annoying as these      small, soft-bodied "plant lice."    </p>    <p>      Aphids constitute a large family (Aphididae) of the order      Homoptera, a group which also includes the cicadas,      leafhoppers, whiteflies, mealybugs, and scale insects. Like      their kin, aphids feed on plant juices through a tubular      proboscis, which is inserted, hypodermicstyle, into the      plant's tissues. In addition to causing much physical      damage, this method of feeding contributes to the      transmission of many plant diseases, especially when the      homopteran is winged and moves readily from plant to plant.    </p>    <p>      Aphids often blend in with the color of the host plant or      hide on the underside of leaves, so the damage they inflict      is usually the first clue to their presence. Curled,      mottled leaves are-a sign that aphids (or similar insects)      are at work. In time, infested plants become stunted and      sickly, and a great deal of chlorophyll may be lost. Young,      tender growth is often preferred by aphids, and the damage      done in such instances can be devastating.    </p>    <p>      The typical aphid hardly needs description. It has a      pear-shaped body one-tenth of an inch or less in length, is      winged or wingless, possesses weak legs, and can be any of      a number of colors. Although these sluggish insects may      seem quite defenseless, they do possess one weapon.      Protruding from the rear of the abdomen are two tubular      structures, the cornicles, which secrete a waxy substance      that deters at least some attackers.    </p>    <p>      When ants are observed moving up and down a plant or tree,      it's almost a sure bet that aphids are present. Many of      these pests excrete copious amounts of a sweet fluid called      honeydew, which ants relish and readily gather up. In fact,      an ant will even use its antennae to milk an aphid, rubbing      the homopteran's abdomen in order to stimulate the flow of      additional honeydew.    </p>    <p>      Indeed, many ants regularly milk their aphid herds and, in      exchange for the sweet treat, provide their six-legged      cattle with a certain degree of protection. The high sugar      content of honeydew also provides an ideal growth medium      for sooty mold, a black fungus that often develops on      heavily infested vegetation. While this fungus does not      attack the leaf, it eventually covers the surface and      hampers many of the plant's vital functions.    </p>    <p>      One key to the enormous success of aphids is their amazing      reproductive capacity, which is potentially higher than      that of any other insect. It's estimated that a single      aphid could have 5 <em>billion</em> descendants between      spring and fall! Each female produces 50 to 100 offspring,      and there may be over 40 generations annually in mild      climates (and even more in greenhouses). Of course, a wide      variety of predators, parasites, and pathogens keep the      aphid population in check, but not always well enough to      prevent damage to our plants.    </p>    <p>      I mentioned that a <em>single</em> aphid could have many      progeny. Now, before you conclude that I don't know much      about the birds and the bees, let me explain a fascinating      aspect of aphid reproduction. Female aphids can give birth      without mating-a fact that no doubt enhances their capacity      to produce offspring! Known to scientists as      parthenogenesis, this phenomenon results in a true virgin      birth and in some respects is a natural cloning process.      Parthenogenesis is also common in some scale insects and in      many wasps.    </p>    <p>      In addition, aphids can give birth to living young, as well      as laying eggs as most insects do. Actually, the process is      somewhat different from the live birth of mammals in that      the aphid merely incubates each egg within its body prior      to giving birth.    </p>    <p>      Aphids live in densely packed colonies, and the seasonal      life history of the society is often quite complex. While      there are many variations, it typically proceeds something      like this: In the spring, wingless female aphids hatch from      eggs that were laid the previous fall. These insects      reproduce asexually and give live birth for two or more      generations on a specific host plant. In time,      <em>winged</em> females appear, which migrate to a      secondary host plant species, continuing their atypical      reproductive habits. As summer comes to a close, succeeding      generations migrate back to the original host plant      species; only then do the males appear. Mating then takes      place, and the resulting eggs pass the winter on the plant,      thus completing the cycle.    </p>    <p>      There are many variations on this scenario, depending on      which species is involved and on the climate of the area.      In the mild southern regions, for example, males and eggs      may not occur at all, since the hardy egg stage is      unnecessary.    </p>    <p>      Once we become familiar with an enemy, we are in a much      better position to battle it. Therefore, in the      <em>next</em> issue, we'll be taking a look at some of the      different types of aphids, and at various methods of      controlling these vampires of the vegetable garden.    </p>
