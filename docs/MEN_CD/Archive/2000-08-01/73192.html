                    <p>      As the cost of home heating oil goes up the energy      inefficiencies of our homes become painfully evident.      Precious warmth - and the energy needed to produce it is      lost forever through air leaks around windows, baseboards      and electrical outlets.    </p>    <p>      Not only is the lack of "enerficiency" financially costly      to individuals, it is also environmentally costly to the      next few generations. Wasted energy produced by      nonrenewable fossil fuel sources totals millions of dollars      annually.    </p>    <p>      But it can be so easy to improve the "enerficiency" of      every home. One of the quickest ways to see results is to      caulk, seal and weather-strip all seams, cracks and      openings to the outside. Take the time to caulk both sides      of your window casing, the inside of the frame and the      outer perimeter. Savings of $100-$200 per season can be      realized just by this alone.    </p>    <p>      Sources of air leaks in our home:    </p>    <p>      <em>Window sashes and frames</em> <em><br />      Baseboards, coves and</em> <em>interior</em> <em>window      trim<br /></em> Chimney <em>penetration<br /></em>      <em>Electrical boxes and outlets<br />      Light, fixtures<br /></em><br />      The same simple steps can be taken in the summer to improve      efficiency in air conditioning costs.    </p>    <p>      <em>D.
