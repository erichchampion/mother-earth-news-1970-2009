                    <p>      Here's a proven, early tornado warning system for rural      residents, drivers and those who depend on electrical      warning systems. The magnetic field of a funnel cloud      registers at approximately 4.5-5.2 kHz and will resonate on      any battery-powered AM radio I use the older radios (no      clips) and have familiarized myself with audio signals that      are normally present. During a storm I just turn down my      radio to 5.3 or as low as it will go (usually there are no      stations there). Lightning will be heard as intermittent      static. Any twister within a 20-mile radius will he heard      as a constant hum. T tried it last spring, heard the hum      and headed for the basement. We had a touch down five miles      away. It works! Spread the word, please! It saves lives!    </p>    <p>      <em>W. Knight<br />      Gillette, WY</em>    </p>
