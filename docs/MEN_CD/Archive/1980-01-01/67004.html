            <hr />    <p>      David and Lydia Miller have built five rammed earth homes      since 1945, and they plan to spend the rest of their      lives...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by David and Lydia Miller    </h5><hr />    <hr />		<p>In an era which tends to celebrate the new    and shun the old, rammed earth construction stands out as a    paradox: After all, the millennium-sold building method    may well <em>also</em> be the technology of the future ...    which we are just now returning to.</p><p> No one knows exactly when    the first rammed earth edifice was built, though historians    agree that the process was employed by the    Romans-during the heyday of that nation's    empire-to build structures in conquered lands. In fact,    the Romans spread the use of earth construction throughout    Europe ... and today, in France (where rammed earth is known    as pise <em>de terre),</em> numerous 400-year-old rammed wall    homes <em>still</em> shelter their occupants with a measure    of comfort and security which no "modern" frame edifice can    offer. </p><p>You see, because rammed earth has such a low rate of    thermal conductivity (it's actually near zero), warmth takes    almost 12 hours to work its way through a 14"-thick wall. The    half-day rate of heat transfer makes the material a perfect    substance for providing thermal mass in passive solar    construction ... since the sun's warmth will actually be    reaching the interior of the house during the cold hours of    the night.</p><p> In addition, the compressional strength of rammed    earth can be as high as 625 PSI, which-though it's only    two-thirds the value of a similar thickness of    concrete-still makes a rammed earth building nearly as    durable as a bomb shelter.</p><p> Why then-if rammed earth    construction is so strong and so time-honored hasn't    this building method caught on in the United States? Well,    the fact is that it did ... once, Ralph Paddy (of South    Dakota State College) conducted extensive research into earth    mixtures and building forms back in the thirties.</p><p> Then-    in 1938- the U.S. Department of Agriculture actually    erected an experimental community of rammed earth buildings.    The results of that test were quite positive: The USDA's    final report noted that rammed earth structures-which    would last indefinitely- could be built for as little    as two-thirds the cost of standard frame houses. The earthen    abodes were also shown to be considerably less expensive to    heat and cool, and-because the homes were labor (as    opposed to material) intensive-it was clear that they    would allow do-it-yourselfers plenty of opportunity to save    money.</p><p> We can only speculate as to why postwar America    snubbed the rammed earth concept: Perhaps the modest    <em>pise</em> technique seemed too basic in the face of our    newly formed technocracy. Or it may have been the    construction industry-which depends so heavily on    material intensive methods for its livelihood-that    helped deprive rammed earth of its rightful position in    building. Furthermore, the public's then increasing yen for    miracle synthetics certainly had something to do with the    lack of acceptance for so "earthy" a technique.</p><p> Fortunately,    attitudes are changing. People are returning to any number of    time-tested ideas and techniques that have been scorned    for the last several decades ... <em>including</em> the    concept of rammed earth construction. And at the center of    this "back-to-the-land-for-building-materials" movement stand    David and Lydia Miller, who have been proponents of rammed    earth homes for more than 40 years, and occupants of such    dwellings since 1945. </p><p>The Millers initially encountered the    "building with soil" process in an article from a 1937 issue    of <em>American Home</em> magazine and-during trips to    eastern Europe in the late 30's-their interest grew as    they corresponded with several English and German architects    who had used the method. </p><p>In 1940, David and Lydia met the man    who would design their rammed earth homes: J. Palmer Boggs    ... an environmentally oriented architect (and professor of    architecture at Oklahoma State University). Together, Boggs    and the Millers built their first house in 1945.</p><p> Then, in    1949-after David and Lydia had been airlifted out of    Berlin (where David had spent two years as a civilian legal    analyst for General Lucius Clay) the architect teamed with    the Greeley, Colorado residents again ... to build the rammed    earth structure the Millers live in today.</p>    <h3>      EARTH SOLAR    </h3>		<p>Since David and Lydia's present home was Boggs's second    collaboration on a rammed earth dwelling, the architect made    use of his previous experience to produce a design that could    still be called advanced by today's standards, but that was a    downright <em>radical</em> departure from normal building    practice back in 1949.</p><p> From a distance, the Miller    home-which rests atop a gentle knoll on the outskirts    of town-looks similar to-many of the sprawling    ranch style houses built in the late 50's. But as you turn up    the tree-lined driveway, you can see several external    features that set the structure apart from any    run-of-the-mill residence. For example, on the east side of    the building-where two perpendicular walls    meet-the thickness of the bulwarks (14 inches of earth    plus an inch of stucco covering) becomes apparent. In    addition, there's a surprising lack of glass on the front of    the house ... to prevent heat loss from that northern    exposure.</p><p> <em>Most</em> of the north-facing glazing is set    around the front door, which is framed by a pair of beautiful    sandstone columns (mined in Lyons, Colorado). However, the    northside bedrooms <em>do</em> have windows to admit natural    light, and a line of glazed vents runs along the roof level    in the living area. </p><p>Despite the lack of glass on the street    side of the house, the home's interior is kept bright by    extensive south-facing glazing. In addition, because the    house arcs gently to match the sun's path, light tends to    penetrate deeply into particular portions of the building at    specific times of day. </p><p>For example, the morning sun shines    into the bedrooms in the east wing and heats both the    wool- carpet -covered floor <em>and</em> an interior    12"thick rammed earth wall. By the afternoon, however, ol'    Sol has slipped around and is beaming in through the living    room's huge thermopane picture windows. More of the woolen    floor covering-as well as much of the inside north wall    <em>and</em> the massive sandstone fireplace- catches    these rays and stores their warmth away for future use.</p><p> While    visiting the Millers, two of MOTHER's staffers inadvertently    discovered just how effectively rammed earth <em>does</em>    hold the sun's energy. A photo session was held on a chilly    October afternoon, and the doors to the living room and    kitchen had to be left open to admit more light for the    photographs. Throughout the course of the camera work, the    home's inside temperature dropped from 65°F to 45°F.    However, once all the pictures were shot (the job took till    just about sunset) the house was closed back up, and the    hungry workers paused to sample some of Mrs. Miller's    homemade bread and plum jam. Amazingly enough, within less    than an hour after shutting out the evening's chill, the    inside temperature rose to 60°F with no source of heat    other than the warmth stored in the walls!</p><p> Furthermore, even    at only 60°F, the dwelling was surprisingly comfortable.    With heat radiating from the walls, the air temperature    actually seemed substantially <em>warmer</em> than the    thermometer indicated.</p><p> Of course, on really frigid days, the    Millers can produce additional warmth by circulating hot    water through pipes embedded in the four-inch concrete slab    floor. This auxiliary heating system was initially served by    a gas-fired boiler, but the Millers have recently    installed additional water-heating components: A local    company, McCreery and Sun, is in the process of placing three    4' X 8' collectors (from Solar Energy Products) on the    Colorado couple's roof, and has also installed a    water-heating device in the living room fireplace ... all of    which will tie into the originally gas-fueled heater. Though    the Millers have used a minimal amount of natural gas in the    past, they anticipate using next to none of the nonrenewable    fuel this winter. </p><p>Naturally, rammed earth walls do just as    fine a job of <em>cooling</em> as they do of heating. The    excess warmth of a particularly hot day doesn't reach the    interior of the house until nightfall ... when the outside    air has cooled. Plus, Palmer Boggs designed a few    <em>special</em> features into the Miller home to help the    walls do their cooling work. The southern side of the house    is equipped with eaves to prevent light from entering during    the summer months, and louvered vents are located at the    bottom and top of the wall to provide convective ventilation.    However, Mrs. Miller claims that it's never necessary to open    more than one of the vents, and that not even a number of    successive 95OF days can raise the inside temperature above    75°F!</p>    <h3>      PROOF IN THE LIVING    </h3>		<p>There are also a number of <em>subtle</em> advantages to    the use of massive earthen walls ... pluses which contribute    to the comfort of this venerable form of passive solar    living. Besides doing a great job of insulating and storing    heat, pise also allows more air exchange than does any    comparable material. Thus a rammed earth house breathes (and    doesn't tend to become clammy like a concrete structure)    without suffering any significant heat loss.</p><p> The thick walls    also provide a feeling of security which goes beyond their    warmth and strength. It's hard to beat a 14" layer of earth    for soundproofing, yet the material's ability to protect    inhabitants from the less desirable aspects of the    out-of-doors (such as extremes of temperature and noise)    doesn't-perhaps because of the native soil in the    bulwarks themselves-seem to intrude upon the residents'    relationship with their environment.</p>    <h3>      DOWN TO EARTH    </h3>		<p>Perhaps the best feature of rammed earth is that almost    anyone can build with it! As you'll see in the sidebar,    constructing the massive walls is actually rather easy, and    most people have the necessary raw materials in their own    back yards! And, if you're willing to supply the labor, a    rammed earth dwelling can be far less expensive than a    conventional (energy inefficient) house of the same size.</p><p>    According to Lydia and Dave, rammed earth homes lend    themselves particularly well to construction on the community    level. Because digging, sifting, and tamping the earth    requires a relatively extensive amount of labor, a work    exchange arrangement among a number of potential rammed earth    builders can offer a way to construct pise dwellings quickly    <em>and</em> economically. Better yet, the spirit of such a    group effort harks back to the days of house raisings in the    formative years of our country.</p><p> Even though the Millers    employed numerous laborers to help in the building of their    home, and used costly custom woodwork extensively (as in the    magnificent pentagonal ceiling that Boggs designed), their    3'200-square-foot abode was completed for $32,000 ... a price    which is slightly lower than that of a comparable    conventional residence of the time. But the point which David    and Lydia would wish to make-and that their house seems    to emphasize is that rammed earth is not just an economy    construction technique ... it results in some of the most    pleasant, comfortable, and energy efficient buildings    available at any price.</p>    <h3>      RAMMED EARTH FROM THE GROUND UP    </h3>        <p>      Though the composition of finished rammed earth walls has      frequently been compared to that of sandstone, it actually      more closely resembles the geological rock type called      conglomerate. Sand is one of the major soil construction      components and clay does bond the materials . . . but      aggregate, with rocks up to an inch in diameter, is also      included in pise    </p>        <p>      The earth in a rammed wall can usually be dug from the      excavation that's made for the home's foundation. Topsoil,      however, can't be included in the mixture and should be set      aside for gardening uses ... while the ground that is used      must be composed of about 30% clay and 70% sand and small      stones. Such a ratio is common in many parts of the      country, but roadbed aggregate must be added to especially      clay-heavy soils.    </p>    <p>      Once earth with the right composition is located (or      mixed), the material must be broken up with a rototiller      and sifted through appropriately meshed screens to remove      any large rocks. (The Millers have stones as large as an      inch in their walls, but some rammed earth builders specify      using nothing larger than hal finch pebbles.) After the      consistency is smoothed, water is added to give the mixture      the proper adhesion. The ideal raw material is just damp      enough to ball up in your hand ... but will still break      apart when dropped. Such a consistency is usually reached      by using about 12% H20, but the ratio varies, depending on      the <em>exact</em> proportion of clay in the soil.    </p>    <p>      Rammed earth walls are built on a foundation that is at      least as wide as are the bulwarks themselves (remember, the      soil-in its final compressed form-will weigh      about 140 pounds per cubic foot). The foundation can be      composed of either poured concrete or specially prepared      rammed earth that has been fortified with the addition of      10% cement.    </p>    <p>      To build the wall, the forms (which are detailed in the      accompanying illustration) are clamped onto the      foundation-the top of which is dampened      slightly-and from four to five inches of earth is      dumped directly atop the moistened concrete.    </p>    <p>      This dirt is then tamped with a flat bottomed device (such      as a concrete filled bucket with some sort of handle      embedded in it) which provides about    </p>    <p>      two pounds of weight for each inch of its diameter. To tamp      properly, just lift the ram and then let it drop ...      continuing the process until the tamper no longer makes any      indentation in the earth. Ramming will compact the loose      dirt to about 50% of its original height, so each layer      will eventually take up between two and three inches of      space.    </p>    <p>      To continue raising the walls, dampen the previously tamped      earth, throw in more dirt, and repeat the procedure. Once      the form is full, take away the wedges, slide the boards      off, remove the 118" steel straps, and move the form up for      the next level.    </p>    <p>      The ends of the walls are truncated by sliding a vertical      board inside the outermost metal straps and packing the      dirt against this barrier. Then, once you've squared one      wall, a corner can be formed by simply butting the next      wall perpendicularly against the original one.    </p>    <p>      The Millers now believe that it's not necessary to cap a      rammed earth wall with concrete, though their 30-year-old      home <em>does</em> have a six-inch layer of the mix poured      on top of the compressed soil. (Some rammed earth builders      are still employing the concrete cap on their walls, while      others compromise by mixing cement in a 1 to 10      ratio-with the last couple of beds of earth.)    </p>    <p>      You can incorporate windows and doors into the massive      walls by framing the proposed openings with 2"-thick lumber      (of appropriate width) and tamping the earth around the      frames. Plumbing and wiring may also be built into the      <em>unpacked</em> walls ... but both junction and switch      boxes should be temporarily plugged-with a piece of      lumber to prevent them from collapsing during the ramming      process.    </p>    <p>      It can take as long as several years for a rammed earth      wall to dry completely (and the strength of the material      increases during the curing period), but the forms can be      removed as soon as you've finished tamping. Then-two      days after the wall is completed - framing, nails,      and other connections can be added. You'll have to act      quickly, though, because within another two weeks the      rammed earth will be too hard to get a nail into ... unless      you first drill the wall with a masonry bit.    </p>    <p>      After the initial 14 days have passed, it's no longer      necessary to protect the rammed earth from rain ... though      moisture will still be able to penetrate the pise      Therefore, exterior and interior coatings are more or less      a matter of your own aesthetic preference. The Miller home      has an external covering of stucco (over chicken wire) and      a layer of plaster on the inside, but David and Lydia plan      to leave the walls in their next house bare. They find the      natural light brown color of the rammed earth to be quite      pleasing.    </p>    <p>      The limitations on size for rammed earth buildings come      more from practical than from structural concerns. There      are "soil skyscrapers" In Europe that are as tall as five      stories, but building a structure over two stories high      involves lifting that would be prohibitive for the      do-it-yourselfer. In addition, because it's difficult to      set floor joists directly Into a rammed earth wall, most      two story pise buildings use a ledge created by narrowing      the wall thickness on the inside -to brace the      support timbers at the second level. Thus a three-story      building with a 12"-thick top wall would have to have a      16"-thick bottom wall to allow enough material to form      joist ledges ... and would be too thick to be      heat-efficient (heat from the sun doesn't have time to      reach the Inside surface of walls over 161 thick).    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, there's just not much written information      available to the owner-builder. The excellent      pamphlets put together by Ralph Paddy at South Dakota State      College are out of print, and the USDA never published much      instructional material on Its test community.    </p><hr />    <p>      MOTHER <em>did report</em> on rammed earth, however ... all      the way back in No. 9 (page 105) with a chapter on the      subject from Ken Kern's book, The Owner-Built Home      (Scribner, $6.95 in paperback). And in No. 23 (page 51)      you'll find a special section devoted mainly to John      McMeekin's pise house. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> These      <em>back issues</em> are available-for $3.00 each      plus $1.00 shipping and handling per order-from      <em>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.O.</em> Box 70,      Hendersonville, <em>North Carolina</em> 28739.
