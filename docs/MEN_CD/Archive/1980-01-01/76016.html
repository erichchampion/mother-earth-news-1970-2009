                    <h5 id="byline">      by Ann and Paul Ehrlich    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and Professor      of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and Anne      Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through their      writing and research-gave special meaning to the words      "population", "resources", and "environment" in the late      1960's. (They also coined the term co-evolution, and did a      lot to make ecology the household word it is today.) But      while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing      in the areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of      us-for instance-have read Paul's book The      Population Bomb) . . . far too few people have any idea of      how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research      (research of the type that tends to be published only in      technical journals and college textbooks). That's why it      pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p><hr />    <h3>      IMMIGRATION IN THE FUTURE    </h3>    <p>      In our last column, we described the growing alarm that      many Americans feel over the ongoing "invasion" of this      country by illegal immigrants . . . mostly from Mexico.      During the mid-1970's, reports carried in the popular media      claimed that as many as 12 million illegal aliens were      residing in the United States, with thousands more pouring      in daily. However, recent-and more carefully      compiled-estimates have put the number of such unlawful      residents at about four million . . . and indicate that the      flow-the actual volume of which remains undetermined-is      heavy in both directions.</p><p> Most illegals apparently come to      this country for temporary work, sending the money to      families left behind. They move back and forth across the      border, working here and returning home frequently to see      their kin. The underlying causes of the migration are the      poverty and lack of jobs in Mexico (roughly half of that      nation's work force is unemployed or grossly underemployed)      and the availability of work at high pay (by Mexican      standards) in the United States.</p>			<h3>A DANGER TO HUMAN RIGHTS</h3>			<p>People who are strongly opposed to Mexican      immigration claim that illegals are taking jobs away from      American workers and that they are a huge burden on our      welfare system. But our studies -as well as those of other      students of the problem-indicate that neither of these      claims has much basis in fact. Still, although the nature      and size of this unauthorized influx have been distorted      and vastly overblown, a real problem <em>does</em> exist.</p><p>      One central issue is that of human rights. People who come      to this country illicitly are particularly vulnerable to      exploitation and abuse. Because they fear exposure,      illegals can't protest when an employer fails to pay them      or when someone robs or cheats them. They rarely apply for      welfare or unemployment benefits-even though they have      often earned them-for the same reason.</p><p> Furthermore, when      they cross the border into the U.S., many migrants are      preyed upon by border bandits. Robbery is almost usual . .      . and rape and murder aren't rare. Not uncommonly, the very      smuggler who was hired to bring the men and women into the      U.S. will rob and abandon his charges.</p><p> What's more, when      Mexican illegals are caught by the Immigration and      Naturalization Service (INS)-either when crossing the      border or while within this country-they're detained in      substandard facilities, then sent back to Mexico after only      the most rudimentary of proceedings. Until recently, the      INS frequently conducted raids on firms suspected of hiring      illegals and rounded up and sent to Mexico all employees      who couldn't prove they were U.S. citizens or legal      residents! Indeed, the INS has sweeping powers to detain      and deport people, which-if abused-could pose a threat to      many American citizens, as well as to illegal aliens. So      far, for the most part, the INS has conducted itself with      restraint . . . but if public hysteria pushes the agency      into a witch hunt, tile situation could change.</p>      <h3>POWER TO THE POWERLESS</h3>			<p>In fact, the situation along our southern border is <em>already</em>      changing. Some illegals are beginning to assert their      rights before being returned to Mexico . . . by demanding      proper deportation proceedings, for instance. It used to be      almost unheard of for a captured alien to resist arrest,      but now such struggles are no longer unusual. (There have      even been gunfights between the Border Patrol officers and      smugglers.)</p><p> Worse yet, the tightened surveillance -      signaled by the erection of the highly publicized fence in      the San Diego/Tijuana border area-has resulted in the      diversion of migrant traffic to desert areas farther east .      ... and some men and wom en don't survive the crossing. As      a result of such tragedies, the U.3.-Mexican border has      become an area often characterized by violence . . . and      the possibility of a serious international incident      occurring there is very real. </p><p>The changes in the border      situation have led to a change in attitudes in Mexico, as      well as in the U.S. Mexican people have, for years, deeply      resented the gringos' penchant for exploiting Mexicans on      both sides of the border: either in the form of U.S.      companies which "invest" in Mexican factories in order to      produce commodities for the American market with      inexpensive Mexican labor, or in the form of other firms      that employ low-cost Mexican labor (legal or illegal) in      the U.S. Mexico is a relatively poor country alongside of a      very rich one, but the nation is no longer powerless . . .      and its government knows it: The land's newly discovered      endowment of oil and natural gas alone gives its leaders      great leverage . . . which is already being used in dealing      with their wealthy and powerful northern neighbor. </p><p>Until      recently, most Mexicans regarded the temporary northward      migration of hundreds of thousands of workers as generally      beneficial to their country, particularly since it helped      relieve the nation's acute unemployment problem. As long as      the workers seemed to be needed by American employers and      were willing to go-and as long as the American public      remained unconcerned-there seemed to be no reason for the      Mexican government to worry. But now the migration has      become a public issue in the U.S.... the Border Patrol has      been urged to "crack down" . . . and there has even been      federal legislation proposed that would outlaw the hiring      of illegals. </p><p>California, in fact, already has such a law,      but the legislation has been difficult to implement. The      burden of enforcement doesn't fall (as it properly should)      on the INS or the police, but is the re sponsibility of the      <em>employers</em> . . . even though it's virtually      impossible for them to determine whether a prospective      employee is a citizen, an illegal, or a legally admitted      alien entitled to a job here.</p><p> Clearly such laws, if      enforced, would soon lead to discrimination against all      Hispanics, unless some sort of forgery-proof work permit      were issued by the government to everyone eligible to work      in the United States. And many people-including      ourselves-believe that requiring work permits for any      Americans could be a first step toward repression.</p>      <h3>SHOULD WE "SLAM THE DOOR"?</h3>			<p>As a result of      the growing fuss over this whole situation, the Mexican      government is showing concern about the treatment of its      citizens in the United States . . . as it did during the      era of the braceros: farm laborers legally recruited for      seasonal work in American fields. Mexican leaders are      worried about the escalation of border violence, the      exploitation of migrants, and the potential consequences of      any serious attempt by the United States to "slam the door"      in the face of Mexicans seeking work.</p><p> Such a radical      "solution" to the immigration problem has actually been      proposed, of course . . . but mainly by people far from the      scene who haven't considered the logistic problems posed by      any attempt to seal a nearly 2,000mile border. The effort      would be doomed to failure, and-at the very least-it would      undoubtedly result in an escalation of violence. A closed      border would also encourage illegals to bring their      families and stay longer, since reentry into Mexico would      be more difficult and hazardous than it now is. </p><p>Then, too,      slamming the door would likely lead to a great increase in      violations of the civil rights of U.S. citizens (especially      those of Mexican descent), as well as the rights of legal      immigrants near the border or anywhere that illegals might      be found . . . which is now almost everywhere. (A recent      report indicated an influx of Mexican illegals in New York      and Boston. Such immigrants go where the jobs are . . . and      employers like them because they're willing to work long,      hard hours for low pay and few benefits in jobs that most      American-seven those who are chronically unemployed-shun.)</p><p>      Sealing the border is clearly not a sensible solution. The      illegal migration can only be dealt with successfully by      attacking its roots. Thus, much of the problem must be      solved in Mexico. If that land's poverty were reduced and      its people were able to make a living at home, they      wouldn't go to a strange country (where they're generally      treated badly) to earn enough to keep their families alive.      And if the population explosion in Mexico could be curbed,      the growth in the work force in coming decades would not      completely swamp the rate of job creation.</p>			<h3>AT THE ROOT OF THINGS</h3>			<p> The Mexican government is aware of      its necessary role in easing the migration problem. In the      last few years, Mexico has established one of the world's      strongest family planning programs. </p><p>However, eradicating      poverty in any rapidly growing, less-developed country has      proven to be an extremely thorny problem . . . and Mexico      is no exception. That nation's leaders hope that their      land's new-found oil wealth will help bail them out. Of      course, whether the supply of "black gold" will really help      solve the problems or will only exacerbate the rich/poor      division within the country remains to be seen . . . but      the opportunity for economic improvement does exist, and so      does the Mexican government's desire to end the nation's      underemployment and poverty.</p><p> Still, some of the problem's      roots lie north of the border, too . . . principally in the      lure of available jobs for migrants. What, then, should the      United States do? Keeping the illegals outan all but      impossible and enormously costly task-would cause economic      problems in the U.S. (by removing workers from their jobs      with no replacements available under the existing      conditions of those jobs) . . . offend Mexico . . . erode      our civil rights . . . and be inhumane to boot. Thus, it      seems to us that the best approach would be to legalize the      migrants in some way . . . and thereby achieve some degree      of regulation and control over who's here and what they're      doing. This approach would, in addition, make it easier to      eliminate the worst abuses and exploitation.</p><p> Earlier this      year, Senator S.I. Hayakawa of California came up with a      proposal for legalization that strikes us as one of the      most practical so far. He suggested that each migrant      deposit $250 (which is less than the going price for being      smuggled into the U.S.) with the Mexican government, to be      held in interest-bearing bonds. In exchange, the migrant      would be issued a travel document entitling him or her to a      six-month visa. The deposit would be returned only if      reclaimed within the six-month period, and the worker would      then be eligible for another visa the following year. </p><p>A      system of this sort would be beneficial to both countries.      It would offer temporary employment to Mexicans, thus      relieving their nation's unemployment pressures while-at      the same time-encouraging the return of many laborers who      would have acquired the kind of skills needed in a      developing country. It would not encourage workers to stay      in the U.S. and bring their families, asironically-closing      the border would do. It would provide American employers      with the low-cost, hard-working labor they want . . . and      help prevent the abuse of those workers. It would also      avoid the need for the police-state enforcement of      immigration laws. And, by satisfying needs on both sides of      the border, the plan would help improve relations between      the United States and Mexico.</p>			<h3>A HUMANE POLICY</h3>			<p>While Hayakawa's proposed system would      solve many aspects of the illegal immigrant problem, the      plan still wouldn't necessarily decrease the contribution      of immigration to population growth in the United States.      Even if most of the Mexican workers were <em>legally</em>      admitted only on a temporary basis, some proportion would      come to stay, regardless of the law.</p><p> Meanwhile, many      Americans are purposely having small families out of the      wish to end U.S. population growth and thus ensure a      brighter future for their children. Who can blame such men      and women for wanting to close the border if they see our      land's population still growing because of a high rate of      immigration? </p><p>There are two important prerequisites to the      establishment of a sensible and humane national immigration      policy. The first is to gather dependable statistics on      both the inflow and the outflow of aliens. The second, of      course, is to establish an explicit national population      policy . . . of which immigration must be an important      component. </p><p>In a finite world, one can no more reasonably      plan a nation to accommodate an ever-growing number of      citizens than one can design an airplane to handle an      ever-growing passenger list. It's crucial that this country      not only end its population growth as soon as possible, but      that it then institute a gradual decline toward a      population size that can be maintained permanently at a      high standard of living. For this goal to be achieved, the      birth rate must be established slightly below the death      rate . . . but just how far below will depend on the level      of net immigration (the number of immigrants minus      emigrants) that a national consensus deems desirable.</p><p> It      seems unlikely that there would be a consensus in favor of      total cessation of immigration. Most Americans apparently      agree that some categories of immigrants must be admitted:      for example, close relatives of people already resident or      naturalized, and refugees from oppression . . . especially      those who've become refugees as a result of American      foreign policy. Emigration of Americans to other lands, of      course, would balance at least <em>some</em> of such      admissions.</p><p> One of the toughest and most persistent      problems that we'll face in the future will be the pressure      for entry into rich countries from citizens of poor      countries who are simply seeking a chance for a better life      . . . a dilemma that the United States already shares with      other industrialized nations around the world. </p><p>A problem as      complex as this one, however, cannot be solved with simple      measures or police action. It will persist in some form as      long as great differences in wealth and opportunity exist      between nations like Mexico and the United States, and as      long as population growth hinders the poor countries'      efforts to develop. But until such inequities can be      reduced, Americans can try to deal with the situation      wisely and humanely . . . rather than reacting to the      migration phenomenon with fear and hostility.    </p><hr />    <p>      A detailed discussion of the movements of people between      nations-with special emphasis on Mexican-American      relations-can be found in      The Golden Door: International Migration, Mexico and the      United States by Paul R. Ehrlich, Loy Silver-back, and Anne      H. Ehrlich (Ballantine, 1979, hard cover, $12.95).    </p>
