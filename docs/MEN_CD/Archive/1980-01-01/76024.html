            			<hr />			<p>It's the dead of winter, and in many      parts of the country the cold wind mutters threats of snow.      The frost is deep in the soil, and the green of the garden      is only a memory. Inside, the rootcellar's starting to look      mighty bare, and the jars of put-by tomatoes are dwindling      fast. Grab a kitten for comfort, curl up in front of the      fire with your garden plan and the new seed catalogs . . .      and dream of spring's fresh promise.</p>      <h3>All-Americans</h3>          <p>      <em>Two of the All-America Selections for 1980 are of      particular interest to vegetable gardeners. A wonderful      vivid yellow zucchini, named Gold Rush, sets loads of      squash on compact plants (they take up a mere four square      feet!). The unusual plant's habit of growth is upright and      open, so air can easily penetrate to the base and prevent      overly wet soil and rotting fruit. Furthermore, just think      how attractive bright yellow Gold Rush would look when      steamed up with a crisp batch of dark green Scallopini      squash ... a Patty Panlzucchini cross that was an All      -America winner in 1977!</em></p><p> <em>Another 1980 prizewinner,      the bronze medal Holiday Time pepper, is both ornamental      and edible! The compact plants (a full-grown specimen can      be put in a quart jar) will even bloom and set fruit      indoors . . . and you don't need to worry about insect-or      hand-pollination. The fruits poke up through the foliage      like tiny dunce caps, and they color as they mature from      yellow to orange to scarlet. When it's time for some spicy      food, you'll find that the little peppers can make a      pungent contribution to your meal.</em></p><p> <em>And here's a      little more All-American news: The (organic, naturally)      garden at MOTHER's Eco-Village has been designated a      display garden by the All-America Selections folks. This      means we'll be exhibiting AAS winners from</em> <em>the      past, present, and immediate future . . . and that people      who attend next year's seminar series on MOTHER's beautiful      mountain property will have still another sight to look      forward to! More about our organic display garden the only      one we know of!-in future issues.</em></p>			<h3>Keepin' It Sweet</h3>			<p>Folks used to joke that the only way to      really appreciate the flavor of sweet corn was to have a      pot of boiling water next to you in the field as you cut      the succulent ears . . . because the time it took to walk      from the corn patch to the kitchen was considered long      enough for this delicate vegetable's rich supply of sugar      to start changing to starch. </p><p>Well, the need for such haste      disappeared-back in 1961-with the development (based on      research done at the Universities of Michigan and Illinois)      of the "shrunken gene" varieties of extra sweet corn. The      two new hybrids (known as Early Extra Sweet and Illinichief      Super Sweet) are twice as sweet as normal corn at the      moment of harvest and-because the sugar content converts to      starch more slowly-four times as sweet 48 hours after      picking. In fact, the only problem with these fine      cultivars is that they absolutely must be kept isolated      from other varieties of corn ... since cross-pollination      causes the extra-sweet hybrids to revert to their dominant      ancestor, starchy field corn. </p><p>However, several seed houses      are now offering alternative varieties that don't need to      be separated from other types of corn: the EH (for      everlasting heritage) hybrids. These corns remain tasty for      up to two weeks after pickin', and their pericarps -the      protective skins of the kernels-are much more tender than      those of "normal" corn. The new EH hybrid species are      called Kandy Korn (Gurney), D-5 (Burrell), Tender-treat EH      and Mainliner EH (Burpee), Golden Sweet EH (Stokes), and      losweet EH (Herbst). Try 'em . . . and leave the pot on the      stove!</p>			<h3>NEW INTRODUCTIONS</h3>        <p>      Brent Elswick brings us all up to date on the best of the      recent croppin' introductions on page 36 of this issue, but      some of the exciting vegetables introduced for 1980 are      just too new for Brent to have tried. Burpee, for instance,      has come up with a compact cucumber-Bush Champion -that can      be grown as close. ly, as 12 inches in the row . . . and      does a terrific job in pots on the patio, too. The same      company's new Butter Boy Hybrid butternut squash produces a      bumper yield in one-third less space than the old favorite      Waltham takes up. Burpee has an upgraded beefsteak tomato,      as well-called Super-steak-that brings Fusarium and      Verticillium resistance to the old favorite.</p><p> For the latest      in leaf lettuce, Park is featuring Crispy Sweet (which      combines the flavor of butter-head types with the      cut-and-come-again qualities of loose-leaf varie. ties),      while the firm's new melon-Honeydew Pineapple -is early (85      days) and has a unique tropical flavor. </p><p>An "ever bearing"      potato is going to be offered by Henry Field: called the      McNeilly va. riety, the hybrid continues to make new tubers      through September ... allowing you to harvest some and      leave the rest to mature. Gurney, in turn, has introduced      the Butte potato ... which out-produces the Russet Burbank      and has 58%a more vitamin C and 20%a more protein than      other varieties. </p><p>Gurney also offers a novel dwarf      grapefruit tree-the product of the company's Micro-Budding      technique-which will bear fruit indoors in two to three      years ... and that's up to ten years earlier than normal      kinds!</p><p> As you can see (and we've dropped just a few      tantalizing tips), 1980 is going to be a great year for new      vegetables. So pen a line to some of the companies in      MOTHER's seed-supplier access list on page 174 ... and      order up some wish books!</p>			<h3>REGIONAL SEED MERCHANTS</h3>			<p>You can, of course, get a fine selection      of seeds from any one of the big national outfits, but did      you know that there are companies that specialize in      varieties for particular geographical areas? Hastings and      Wyatt-Quarles, for example, offer plants for the South,      while Burrell sells far West favorites. Roswell, on the      other hand, deals in items for the Southwest . . . and      Johnny's, Farmer, and Vesey all have hardy seeds for the      far North.</p><p> So if your climatic conditions are      <em>really</em> unusual-very dry, or cold, or hot-consider      placing your garden purchase order with one of the regional      seed merchants. (By the way, some of the <em>big</em>      companies regionalize their catalogs, too: Burpee has its      famous "bulls-eyes" to indicate vegetables particularly      suited to your area, Thompson & Morgan indicates-with      asterisks-varieties that will do well in the South, and the      Dave Wilson Nursery in California breaks down the country      into 41 zones and suggests fruit trees especially adapted      to each!)    </p>
