            <hr />    <p>      In response to a number of letters asking for advice,      here's how to    </p>    		<hr />        <p>      Well. cold weather has settled in again, and you can bet      your bottom dollar that quite a few folks are scratching      for an effective, <em>inexpensive</em> way to heat their      homes this winter season. Many such people have turned to      wood as a source of warmth for their abodes ... but, of      course, not all of us have the kind of access to low-cost      timber that makes wood heat <em>really</em> economical.</p><p>      Happily, though, MOTHER's crew of researchers came up with      a dandy little furnace last winter (see MOTHER NO. 53, page      104) that uses waste motor oil-drained from cars, trucks,      buses, etc.-as a source of (for the most part)      <em>free</em> fuel! Better yet, the stove is so simple in      design that just about anyone can build it in a day's time      ... for a total cost of less than $40! </p><p>Of course, the used      lubricant taken from an automobile's crankcase is bound to      be dirty, so it must be filtered before use ...      and-unless you want to spend a lot of time and money      (not to mention energy) on a complicated system of hoses,      pumps, and filters-we think the best way to go about      tidying up your "motor squeezin's" is to fashion the setup      depicted here. Give it a try ... and happy heating!</p>      <p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: You can obtain a copy of MOTHER NO. 53      by sending $3.00 plus $1.00 for shipping and handling to      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.O.
