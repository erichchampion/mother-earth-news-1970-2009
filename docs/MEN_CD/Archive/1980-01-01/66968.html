                <p>      If you've always wanted a vineyard of your own, January's      the month to get it started... with (often      free-for-the-trimmin') grape cuttings!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by GORDON TILLOTSON    </h5>        <hr />    <p>      Our Oklahoma farmstead has a warm, gentle slope-just      to the south side of the house-where my wife Diane      and I had, from the day we moved in, dreamed of building a      grape arbor. Unfortunately, although we knew we      <em>wanted</em> a "backyard vineyard", we didn't have the      faintest idea how to begin such a project. Then one      day-quite by accident-we noticed a small card      tacked to the bulletin board at the County Agricultural      Extension Service office: "Oklahoma Grape Growers      Association meeting, second Wednesday of every      month".<br />      <br />      You can bet we went out of our way to attend the next      meeting-and we <em>learned</em> a lot there,      too-but, more important, we met Walter Riggs ... one      of the local grape growers. I asked him if he had any      grapevines for sale.<br />      <br />      "Oh no!" Walt exclaimed. "I never sell my plants. But I'll      tell you what ... if you come to see me in January, I'll      give you as many cuttings as you want. Heck," he chuckled,      "I'll even show you how to prune the vines!"    </p>    <h3>      DO YOUR HOMEWORK    </h3>    <p>      In the course of the next two months, I just about emptied      my local library's shelves of books on every facet of grape      culture: taking cuttings, soil management, planting,      grafting, pruning ... even winemaking. In the process, I      learned that grapes fall into four principal      categories.<br />      <br />      <em>Vitis labrusca:</em> the American or Fox-type grape,      grown mainly east of the Rockies and in the Great Lakes      region of the U.S. and Canada. (The familiar Concord grape      is the leading and typical variety of this species.)<br />      <br />      <em>Vitis vinifera: the</em> "Old World" grape, grown      principally in California, Arizona, and lower Texas.<br />      <br />      <em>Vitis rotundifolia:</em> found mostly in the south      Atlantic and Gulf states. This species includes the      muscadine and scuppernong varieties.<br />      <br />      <em>Vitis riparia:</em> the "offspring" of the wild grape,      and the most. widely distributed of any American species.      It's highly resistant to phylloxera, a small insect that      feeds on the roots of the grapevine.    </p>    <h3>      GET OUT IN THE FIELD    </h3>    <p>      That January (1974), we showed up at Walt's place. His 200      eight-year-old vines sent canes running in mass confusion,      and we began to understand why Mr. Riggs had chuckled when      he offered to teach us about pruning.<br />      <br />      He pointed out the main trunk of a vine.<br />      <br />      "Look for the four arms-two on each side-with      the best one-year-old growth," he told us.<br />      <br />      We saw that two of such "super shoots" were down at the      three-foot-level supporting wire, and two more were up at      the five-foot-level strand.<br />      <br />      "Now count out 15 buds on each of the four strong canes,"      he instructed, "and cut off the rest of the arm."<br />      <br />      With that part of the task done, we trimmed off all the      other canes, sprouts, and suckers ... being sure to leave      two renewal spurs-with two buds apiece-at each      level, to insure the growth of new fruiting canes for the      next year's grape production.<br />      <br />      I have to admit that we were shocked at first-to be      cutting away 80% or more of the plant's growth, but we soon      learned that, if the trimming weren't done, all the grape's      vitality would go to supporting the tremendous vine ... and      little "energy" wouId be left to produce fruit.<br />      <br />      When we'd finished pruning and had raked all the cutoff      growth from between the rows, our teacher pointed out the      pattern of his vineyard. Upright posts (Walt used old      railroad ties) were placed every 20 feet, while each vine      was five feet from the nearest post and 10 feet from its      closest neighboring plant.    </p>    <h3>      SELECT YOUR GRAPES    </h3>    <p>      When our education in "grape basics was complete, Mr. Riggs      helped us make cuttings for our own nursery bed at home. We      looked over his offerings and gathered a number of      one-year-old prunings. We chose three varieties.<br />      <br />      <em>Himrod:</em> a white, seedless table grape ... not      especially good for jelly or wine, but just wonderful for      fresh-from-the-vine eating.<br />      <br />      <em>Landot 244:</em> a French varietal grape, excellent for      making a deep ruby wine... dry and very much like      Beaujolais. (Walt said it should age well, <em>if</em> we      could let it situnsampled long enough.)<br />      <br />      <em>Concord:</em> the all-time favorite for jams, jellies,      and old-fashioned Concord wine.<br />      <br />      We made bundles of 20 to 30 cuttings all 10 to 12 inches      long with four buds each. They were trimmed off square on      the bottom and at an angle on the top so we'd know "which      end was up" when planting time came around.    </p>    <h3>      CARE FOR YOUR CUTTINGS    </h3>    <p>      Once we arrived back at our garden, we tagged the bundles,      buried each of 'em heads-down in a 15-inch-deep hole (to      keep them cool and dormant), and marked the locations with      stakes.<br />      <br />      Then, at the end of March (1974), we dug our cuttings up      and-after careful sorting and selecting-set out      50 sprigs in our prepared nursery bed. We placed the sticks      in a shallow trench-at an angle, so they'd catch the      sun-covered the bottom halves, and were careful to leave      two buds (per shoot) above the ground. (That way, if one      bud <em>didn't</em> produce, there was always a second      chance.)<br />      <br />      When spring rolled around again (1975), we ended up with 20      vines to set out and a dozen to share with our neighbors.      (According to one grape authority, a 50% Survival rate from      cuttings is considered good, so we were really fortunate to      have done so we] I.)    </p>    <h3>      LAY OUT YOUR VINEYARD    </h3>    <p>      We laid out our grape arbor as Walt Riggs had taught us ...      digging the holes (which would "house" our now rooted      vines) three feet deep and ten feet apart. Since we have a      lot of red clay in our earth, we filled the bottom of each      pit with good topsoil ... to make it easier for our vines      to get started. Carefully, we spread the roots of the young      plants over the rich earth and gently packed more topsoil      around them.<br />      <br />      At that point, we went our own way a little. We followed      the topsoil with alternate layers of old hay, a handful of      wood ash, and two handfuls of rock phosphate. Just before      we put on the last layer of hay, I worked in a shovelful of      well-rotted cow manure. (Most grape growers in our area shy      away from fertilizing. They tend to feel that the vines      produce better grapes by having to work at it.) All through      the summer and fall of that second season and the third, we      cleared the new arbor of weeds by rototillingjust enough to      break the soil-and kept the vines well mulched with      spoiled hay.    </p>    <h3>      PRUNE CAREFULLY    </h3>    <p>      The new year arrived (January 1976), and it was time to      prune. We picked out two lower and two upper canes on the      main trunks, trimmed them back to 10 <em>buds</em> each,      and cut off the rest of the growth.<br />      <br />      And-since we didn't want to run into trouble with      vine training later on-we set the posts and strung      the wire. (Now our grape patch was starting to look like      areal vineyard!)<br />      <br />      Sure enough, the first tiny fruit clusters appeared that      fall ... but we decided to pinch them back, and let the      vines mature for one more year.<br />      <br />      In January 1977 we again selected the four strongest and      healthiest canes ... and this time (as we'd done at      Walt's), we cut them back to 15 <em>buds</em> each before      removing all the other growth.    </p>    <h3>      REAP THE HARVEST    </h3>    <p>      When fall came 'round again, we reaped our first harvest      ... big clusters of fine, succulent fruit! Soon, there was      jelly on the shelves and wine in the cellar (both of which      provided us with special Christmas gifts for friends and      relatives!).<br />      <br />      Sure, it took work ... and time ... and patience to turn      our free cuttings into a producing row of grapes, but that      kind of "sweat equity" isn't much to pay for the great and      glorious satisfaction of owning your own vineyard!    </p>
