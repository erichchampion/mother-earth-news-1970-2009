            			<hr />    <p>      For the past several years, the good folks at the Institute      for Local Self-      Reliance in Washington, D.C. have worked to help urban      residents gain greater control over their lives through the      use of low-technology, decentralist tools and concepts. We      strongly believe that more people (city dwellers and      country folk alike) should be exposed to the Institute's      admirable efforts ... which is why we've made this "what's      happening where" report by ILSR staffers one of MOTHER's      regular features.    </p><hr />    <p>      Over the next few months, a new national program will help      many Americans take a hard look at how they use energy in      their homes, and will also explain what can be done to cut      a household's use of electricity, gas, heating oil, etc.      Under the National Energy Conservation Act of November 1978      (which is just now getting into gear), each state is      required to design its own power consumption plan. However,      although there will be <em>features</em> that vary from      plan to plan, the goals of them all will be the same: to      tell homeowners how they can use energy more efficiently,      and to help them finance the investment required to cut      down on power use.</p>			<h3>SUCCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL</h3>			<p> So far, the best energy conservation efforts      have involved governments and citizens working together at      the local level. For example-after a study of local power      consumption that involved more than 2,000 residents-the      city of Portland, Oregon enacted the nation's most      ambitious energy conservation law. That plan could save the      citizens an estimated 30% of their current energy use by      1995.</p><p> And we here at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance      in Washington, D.C. are showing how citizens in a big city      can work together to cut home energy costs.</p>			<h3>AN ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAM</h3>			<p>Last March, the Institute      began an experimental neighborhood energy audit program in      Anacostia ... an area in the southeast section of the      nation's capital. In order to measure the results, we      selected a four-square-block section of 1,000 households,      which-collectively-were consuming 150 billion Btu's of      electricity, gas, and oil each year . . . for a combined      energy bill of $700,000.</p><p> To run the program, the Institute      recruited six previously unemployed neighborhood residents      from a local job bank. The crew was then given four weeks      of extensive training in building construction and      materials, heat transfer, heating and cooling mechanical      systems, and solar applications.</p>			<h3>A NOT-SO-SIMPLE JOB</h3>			<p> Our initial audit proved that there's more to      running an energy conservation plan than talking about      storm windows and attic insulation. We uncovered a      structurally deficient foundation in the very first house      that we visited (and it doesn't make much sense to insulate      a dwelling that's falling down). Therefore, the auditors      put that particular homeowner in touch with a local housing      rehabilitation program.</p><p> Our team also found that many      people were reluctant to spend their hard-earned money on      home weatherproofing, even when such an investment would      clearly save them cash in the long run. So the Institute      prepared a fact sheet on financing (including a lot of      private and public loan sources), and the auditors      discussed financing possibilities with residents after each      inspection. In some cases the auditors were able to      convince local merchants to offer discounts on      weatherization materials to those families who had received      a home energy analysis.</p>			<h3>EARLY RETURNS</h3>      <p>After this winter, the Institute will have some real data      on long-term energy savings produced by our project, but      there have already been impressive results!</p><p> We found that      most people in Anacostia, for example, have their water      heater thermostats set too high. Simply by turning them      down, the 200 audited households were able to save an      estimated total of $2,000 in fuel bills.</p><p> Many of the      families we visited also discovered some basics about the      construction of their homes in the course of their audits.      Some folks, for instance, who live in houses with crawl      spaces between the highest ceiling and the roof were      surprised to learn such areas existed. Another tenant was      shocked to find out that a simple electric fan doubled his      electricity consumption at certain times of the day. (He      made his discovery after learning how to read the meter as      it recorded his home's electric usage.)</p><p> Depending on how      each state designs its energy plan, community organizations      around the country may get a chance to set up auditing      projects similar to the Anacostia program. Interested      groups should contact their state's energy office to find      out how they can help draft their own region's plan. A      helpful information packet about the National Energy      Conservation Act-which includes suggestions for formulating      state plans-is available for $2.50 from Annette Woolson,      Environmental Action Foundation, 1346 Connecticut Avenue      N.W., Suite 724, Washington, D.C. 20036. For a good guide      called "Project Save Me", on organizing a local energy      audit program, send $2.00 to Oasis 2000, U.W. Center-Barron      County, Rice Lake, Wisconsin 54868.</p><p> <em>You can have a free      catalog of</em> <em>ILSR's selection of books and pamphlets      by sending the Institute a self-addressed, stamped      envelope.
