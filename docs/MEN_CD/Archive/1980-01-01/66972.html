                <p>      Jim McClarin made an interesting and energy-saving discovery...    </p>		<hr />        <p>      One evening-in order to preserve two gallons of fresh      milk while I was temporarily without refrigeration-I      set about to sour the liquid into yogurt. First, I heated      the milk to kill most of the bacteria. Then, when it had      cooled down to around 105°F, I inoculated the "moo      juice" with storebought yogurt.    </p>    <p>      However, just as I reached that point in the yogurt-making      process, I was unexpectedly invited out to dinner. In order      not to waste the milk (or pass up the invitation), I had to      locate a warm spot for my pail ... and remembered some      half-buried mental note on how the ancient Chinese had made      a practice of cooking eggs in compost.    </p>    <p>      Luckily, the pile of future garden helper that I had built      months earlier was spewing out quite a bit of steam, so I      stashed the airtight container in the hot compost ... just      (I thought) until I could get back home and rig up my usual      light bulb and ice chest incubator. As it turned out,      however, I didn't return until quite late ... and decided      the pail could stay where it was till morning.    </p>		<h3>AND GUESS WHAT!</h3>    <p>      When I lifted the lid the next day, I found ... not yogurt,      but cheese! Perhaps the milk wasn't heated up enough in the      first place ... or maybe the humus heap was too hot. At any      rate, a fine cheese curd had formed.    </p>    <p>      Since that first attempt, I've learned to probe carefully      in the warm "working" mound until I find a spot with just      the right warmth to create successful compost yogurt ... a      dish that has become a regular part of my diet!    </p>    <p>      For my second experiment, I decided to try to cook a nice      fresh egg ... safely enclosed in a plastic bag. I dug down      into the decaying matter until I said "ouch" when I grabbed      a hot handful, dropped in the sack with a rope attached,      and covered it over again.    </p>    <p>      Then, early the next day, I peeled and ate the most      mouthwatering hard-boiled egg of my life ... except, of      course, the taste treat <em>hadn't been</em> boiled: My      slow-cooked repast had none of the mealiness of yolk and      rubbery textured white that I had-in the      past-associated with the dish. Now, whenever I hanker      for a <em>real</em> breakfast treat, I drop a few eggs into      the compost heap In the evening and look forward to a      morning feast.    </p>		<h3>THE PERFECT ROAST</h3>    <p>      Before long, I got around to trying to cook meat dishes in      my organic "oven". The first roast, alas, was a failure. My      newly built compost pile hadn't warmed up enough yet, while      the established heap was a bit too cool. I was undaunted,      however, and bought another roast ... along with a meat      thermometer. Once the new heap had gotten "up to heat", I      put the second piece of beef inside my yogurt pail (to keep      it sealed against bacteria) and buried the whole kit and      caboodle in the hottest part of the pile (where the      temperature tested out at 155°F).    </p>    <p>      Thirteen hours later, a brief taste of the meat trapped in      its own broth convinced me that compost is the only way to      roast!    </p>    <p>      I served the tender, juicy viand to friends at lunch that      day, and they all agreed it was superb.    </p>    <p>      In no time at all, a duck with orange juice and apricots      found its way into the hot heap. It stayed buried for 23      hours at 155-165°F ... and was perfect when I      served it with wine and wild plum sauce.    </p>		<h3>SOME LIMITATIONS</h3>    <p>      I must admit, however, that my unusual cooking method does      have its limits ... as I found out when I tried to cook      pinto beans and soybeans. After repeated checks for      "doneness," I finally had to throw the still-hard legumes      away ... and the same fate befell my compost-uncooked      potatoes and carrots. (I guess such victuals require higher      temperatures than most "garden mounds" are able to      generate.)    </p>    <p>      At one point, I tried to turn my natural heat source into      an organic shower ... by lacing a garden hose back and      forth through the pile as I built it. However, that setup      produced only a pitiful gallon of warm water at a time. The      shortcoming <em>might</em> be remedied with the use of a      buried water tank, but I'm not sure it's wise from the      standpoint of composting-to rob the brewing pile of      that much heat.    </p>    <p>      There's no telling where my experiments with compost      cuisine will take me from here. I might try to incubate      soybean tempeh ... on the theory that all of the compost's      little microbes generate so much life force that-as      seems to happen with my yogurt-they're <em>bound      to</em> produce a beneficial effect on other fermenting      organisms ... even when sealed away from them!    </p>    <p>      Of course, my limited knowledge of microbiology doesn't      permit me to <em>recommend compost</em> cookery to anyone      else. I can merely state that it works just fine for me!    </p><hr />		<h3>      THERE'S MORE TO COME!    </h3>            <p>      <em>You may be surprised to know that the heat generated by      a pile of compost can do much more then merely cook a meal.      In fact, MOTHER recently returned from a visit with the      wellknown French wholistic gardener Joan Pain (shown in the      accompanying photo)</em> ... <em>whose compost heap heals      his home</em> and <em>water supply while it produces the      methane that Jean uses to cook meals and fuel his van! And,      of course, the "finished" organic matter is one of the      secrets of the Frenchman's gardening successes. Look for a      story on this incredible innovator</em> ... <em>in MOTHER      NO. 62!</em>    </p>
