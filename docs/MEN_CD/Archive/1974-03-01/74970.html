The U.S. was one of those countries and it      is still officially illegal for our Congress to declare war.    </p>		<p>      <strong>FOR THE PAST TWO SUMMERS</strong><br />A group known as      the Wisconsin Alliance has organized "Farm Brigades" of 1      to 4 people who work for several weeks on small farmsteads      whose owners can't afford to hire regular extra labor.      "Brigaders," says an Alliance spokesman, "need not have any      farm experience-only a willingness to work hard at      unskilled tasks." Otherwise city-bound high school students      and college men and women welcome this chance for a working      country "vacation" and the farm owners they help always      request more Brigaders than the Alliance can furnish. The      idea seems well worth a try in other areas of the country.</p>			<p>			<strong>ECONOMIST PAUL A. SAMUELSON</strong><br />      Author of one of the most widely read college textbooks on      the subject, is now turned on to the realities of modern      life. The 9th edition of his manual still comes on strong      for Gross National Product (which many of the New      Generation consider very gross indeed) ...but it also      mentions, for the first time, a new economic index      called--appropriately The letters stand for Net Economic      Welfare. A leading economist, to put it another way, now      recognizes that the sheer material handling of more and      more dollar commodities doesn't necessarily increase the      quality of life for those doing the handling. For an      economist, <strong><em>that's NEWS</em></strong>      <em>!</em>    </p>		</div>    <p>      <strong>"WORLDWIDE CATASTROPHE AND TURMOIL"</strong>    </p>    <p>		Is predicted by Indiana University Professor J.J.      Hidore...unless human population growth is curtailed and      energy consumption reduced. Hidore, in his new book,      Physical Geography: Earth Systems , says that "growth and      technological development have led to the extermination of      many living organisms, the concentration of wastes in      amounts that the environment cannot absorb and the      introduction of material--such as synthetic      pesticides--that nature has no way of rendering harmless".      The IU prof points out that hints of the coming calamity      are all around us ...in the form of food shortages, an      increasing lack of potable water in some areas, steadily      expanding shortfalls of electricity and other developing      evidence that our "unlimited growth" society is bumping up      against the planet's finite limits. The answer? Hidore is      pessimistic. "Technology alone," he says, "will not provide      a solution. Frequently, technology 'solves' environmental      problems in ways that are worse than the situations they      were supposed to correct."    </p>		<p>      <strong>1984 , THE SUBJECT OF GEORGE ORWELL'S CHILLING 1948      NOVEL</strong><br /> Is now only ten years away. What will it      really be like? According to several British authors, poets      and social scientists who were asked that question: "Just      like 1974, only more so. Crime will be up. So will gambling      (by an increasingly bored population), riots, hijackings,      army coups, traffic congestion, noise, lines of waiting      people and lack of solitude. There will be more anti-social      activity, environmental deterioration and loss of privacy.      The last quarter of the 20th century is destined to become      a mighty crush of bodies." This projection, of course, is      based on the premise that the world's human population will      continue pursuing "progress" in the form of more people and      rising per-capita consumption of non-renewable resources.      Wouldn't it be nice, though, if we redefined      "progress"...in favor of green grass, open spaces, peace      and quiet?		</p>	    <p>      <strong>THE WAY WE SEE IT</strong><br /> Real wealth--land,      self-sufficient energy systems, food growing and processing      skills, will become even more real in the years ahead. Take      heed of the handwriting on the wall and act accordingly.</p><p>      Copyright Â© 2001-2002, Ogden Publications, Inc.<br />      All rights reserved.    </p>
