                    <p>      Even with modern antibiotics and premixed medicated poultry      rations, chickens still get sick . . . sometimes with      fairly lethal diseases that can sweep quickly through a      flock. We rely on our few hens for their eggs and want them      to be healthy-for their sake and ours-so we started digging      around in the older farm books and asking questions about      the birds' ailments. The remedies we came up with use      simple, cheap, easily available ingredients and methods      that are surprisingly like those frequently employed in      home nursing.    </p>    <p>      Since the best cure of all is prevention; knowing something      in advance of your flock's needs can ward off a lot of      trouble. Basically, chickens should be kept warm and dry,      get plenty of exercise and eat a well-balanced diet . . .      sounds familiar, doesn't it?    </p>    <p>      Hens left to roam will satisfy their dietary needs and      busily keep the local bug population under control (just      take care to protect the vegetable garden, because the      birds also love young green stuff ).    </p>    <p>      Onions and garlic fed regularly are a natural preventative      of any worms that might be thinking of a home in your      fowls' warm innards, and sour milk or buttermilk mixed in      their feed or drinking water will deter diarrhea. Feet and      droppings in food or drink are a potential source of      infection when birds are confined so equip your chicken      house with feeders and watering equipment that force the      biddies to observe sanitary table manners.    </p>    <p>      New birds should be quarantined a few days before joining      an existing flock and, to control the spread of parasites      and disease, henhouse's and brooders should be thoroughly      aired and whitewashed between flocks.    </p>    <p>      During the winter, keep chicken house litter dry and      exposed to air by scattering scratch feed around on it      every day. This serves the added purpose of providing the      hens with exercise so that they stay warm and healthy. On      especially cold mornings try adding one tablespoon of      kerosene to their drinking water as a pick-me-up.    </p>    <p>      Among the actual diseases that infect domestic fowl,      diarrhea is the most common. This condition-revealed by      white or greenish, loose droppings-can be caused by cold,      dampness, dirty surroundings and unclean food. Isolate the      patient in warm, dry quarters and give her potassium      ,permanganate solution to drink. To make this remedy,      dissolve one tablespoon of the chemical in one quart of      warm water. Then, for each bird, take one tablespoon of      this concentrated solution and further dissolve it in one      cup of warm water . . . in severe cases use a stronger      solution, potent enough to turn a dipped finger slightly      brown. (Don't keep potassium permanganate mixture in a      metal container.)    </p>    <p>      Another remedy for diarrhea is Epsom salts in the feed . .      . half a pound per 100 birds or 1/2 teaspoon each. Then      feed the sick chickens wheat bran moistened with sour milk      or buttermilk.    </p>    <p>      Roup is caused by cold, damp or drafty quarters or by      overcrowded housing, and is spread through the drinking      water or feed. The symptoms are like those of the common      cold: sneezing and a watery discharge which later turns      foamy white and then yellowish-from the eyes or nostrils.      Sometimes diarrhea, weakness and swelling of the head will      also occur. You'll find on examination that the bird's      throat is inflamed, with patches of gray and yellow forming      a membrane that almost closes the passage.    </p>    <p>      To treat this illness isolate the hen in a warm coop or box      lined with hay or straw. The container should be placed in      a sunny spot and covered at night. Feed the patient stale      bread moistened with milk (preferably milk in which onions      have been boiled) . . . or try cooked rice mixed with      chopped parsley and onion tops with a tablespoon of      powdered charcoal added twice a day. For drink use a weak      potassium permanganate solu tion.    </p>    <p>      Gapes is a disease caused by a parasitic roundworm which is      about 5/16 this of an inch long and looks like a fine      thread. These pests lodge in the hen's throat and multiply      there, so that the bird frequently opens its mouth wide as      if yawning. To treat this condition make a salt brine, or      steep tobacco in water for ten minutes. Pour one      teaspoonful of either mixture down the chicken's throat.      Then, keeping its head up, close the bird's nose holes and      count slowly to five Next hold the patient by the feet,      head down, and it will usually cough, sputter and evict the      worms.    </p>    <p>      Scaly legs-which makes even young hens look like old crones      with bumpy underpinnings-is actually caused by a parasite      and is contagious. Combat the disease by bathing and      softening the bird's limbs for a few minutes in a medium      strong solution of that old cure-all, potassium      permanganate. Wash the skin thoroughly, dry it and rub on      some vaseline Repeat the treatment every three days.    </p>    <p>      Liver trouble is a non-contagious ailment that affects      mostly older, heavier birds in the late winter and early      spring. Sometimes the fowls die without warning, or they      become sluggish and their faces and combs turn either      yellowish or purple. The chickens may also have diarrhea      and lose their appetites. The disease is caused by too      little exercise and too much heavy, rich feed. It can be      prevented by giving the flock a good supply of greens the      year round. If this disorder does occur, the remedy is a      dose of Epsom salts as for diarrhea. Feather pulling is not      a disease, but indicates a dietary deficiency which can be      remedied by regularly feeding meat and animal scraps to      your chickens. All these remedies were thoroughly accepted      in the early part of this century, before the age of      antibiotics. If they worked then, they should now . . . and      I, for one, intend to give these no strums a try if it ever      becomes necessary.    </p>    <h5>      <em>Patricia Earnest</em></h5>
