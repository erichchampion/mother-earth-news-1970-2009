    <p>
                        <p>      What in the world are the professions coming to? First      radical lawyers, then young physicians who thumb their      noses at the AMA and now a troublesome breed of architect      whose avowed aim is to provide-as one of them puts      it-"a realistic alternative to the exploitational      vision of the environment".    </p>    <p>      The writer of those words, a young English designer named      Grahame Caine, belongs to an anarchist architect group      called "Street Farmer" and startled the British wing of the      profession back in 1971 when he entered a competition for a      housing development with a plan for a self-growing bamboo      shelter. Now he's up to a new scheme that has been two      years in the planning and is likely to have much more      widespread applications than the bamboo effort. In fact,      his current project is receiving a good deal of publicity      in England (as well as a surprising amount of support from      municipal authorities).    </p>    <p>      Caine's new idea is his final examination project for the      Architectural Association of London, where he's a      fifth-year student . . . but the structure he's erecting on      the corner of an athletic field in Greenwich (for under      $2,000) will also be his home for the next couple of years.      This kind of testing is essential because the Caine      Eco-House-unlike a conventional building-is      planned as a self-contained working system that      incorporates plant and animal life (Grahame's own) in      harmonious interdependence. Since the 37 X 40-foot timber      and plastic dwelling will include a garden that is to      supply most of the householder's food, the      architect-single and a vegetarian-is his own      ideal guinea pig.    </p>    <p>      Grahame's principles of design-conservation of      resources, independence from wasteful, dirty public power      and respect for natural ecosystems-are shared by      growing numbers of people in the U.S. and Canada . . . and      I'd like to comment on his plans with an eye to how they      might be modified for use on the North American Continent.    </p>    <h3>      THE PLAN OF THE ECO-HOUSE    </h3>    <p>      The plans for Grahame Caine's Eco-House are included here      for clarity and interest. No one should use them exactly as      they are, however . . . unless, of course, he lives next      door to Grahame. If you want to build such a dwelling from      scratch, you must consider the climate of your site and      modify the design accordingly.    </p>    <p>      The difference of even one degree of latitude, or 1,000      feet of elevation, will affect some key points in the plan      of an Eco-House. The building should be in a position to      get maximum sun in cold climates, for example, but might      need shelter from the heat in the South. Again, insulation      will be needed to keep the house warm with minimum fuel use      in the North, and cool without air conditioning in the      South . . . but on an island in the tropics, insulation      might be unnecessary. It all depends on where you are.    </p>    <h3>      WATER    </h3>    <p>      Grahame's water source-the key to his own health and      the life of the greenhouse plants that will supply most of      his food-is the rain that falls on his      600-square-foot roof. The notoriously damp British climate,      which dumps 25 inches of precipitation on London per year,      should provide Caine with about 20 gallons or so a day.      This is only, about half the amount one person uses in an      average home . . . but Grahame's dwelling is a long way      from average. (The normal toilet, for instance, uses two      gallons of water when flushed. The Caine model takes two      pints.) Nevertheless, the father of the Eco-House is a      realist and is installing pipes to city water as a backup      "just in case" of drought.    </p>    <p>      Though the quantity of London's rain is ample for      collection by householders, its quality is a drawback.      Besides the sand filter that will clean the dust and      impurities from his water supply, Grahame is considering      more sophisticated devices to remove some of the high lead      content of the precipitation from a dirty urban sky.    </p>    <p>      In a cleaner area, though, rainwater may well be freer of      pollution than well water. Caine's method of supplying      himself with water also has other advantages worth      considering. For one thing, rain is sure to be more      pleasant to the taste than chlorinated city water,      an-as generations of farm women know-it's very      soft and excellent for washing everything from hair to the      family laundry.    </p>    <p>      Is reliance on rainwater practical in North America?      Clearly, that depends on the area, since rainfall on this      continent varies from 80 inches annually on the extreme      West Coast to less than 5 inches in the deserts. If you're      considering rainwater for your own household use, find a      precipitation map in your nearest library and check the      average yearly figure for your location. If it's more than      30 inches, the supply is ample . . . if it's less than 5,      give up the idea.    </p>    <p>      How much water you can gather depends, of course, on how      big a surface you have to catch it. In Table 1 I've set out      the area of roof needed to supply one person with 25      gallons of water per day for various rainfalls ranging      between 5 inches and 30 inches annually. This is much less      than an average individual uses . . . but then, our pioneer      ancestors got by with bucketing 5 gallons a day each, and      there's no reason why we can't limit our consumption with a      little care.    </p>    <p>      The water supply, as it comes from the roof, should pass      into a setup that allows the first few gallons to run away      after washing the collecting surface clean. What's gathered      thereafter should go through a sand filter-to remove      any dust washed out of the atmosphere-and then into a      storage tank with an outflow that sends the water through      an activated charcoal purifier before use.    </p>    <p>      To store enough water to supply four people for 60 days (a      surplus that allows for two months with hardly any rain)      you'll need an 800-cubic-foot vessel. Probably the most      practical form is a concrete tank in the ground. A      rectangular container 9 X 9 X 10 feet would do, and so      would a cylinder 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep.    </p>    <p>      A single use for kitchen or bathroom purposes is all the      conventional household gets out of any one gallon of water.      In a home like Grahame's, though, that's just the beginning      . . . and what happens to the used fluid, and the other      normal "wastes", is the most unusual feature of a very      unusual house.    </p>    <h3>      THE WASTE RECOVERY SYSTEM    </h3>    <p>      All the waste water from Grahame's kitchen and bathroom, as      well as all organic solid wastes, are passed on to an      ingenious system that converts the material to methane gas      for cooking fuel and liquid nutrients for the greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      As Figure 2 shows, the wastes first enter a two-compartment      (one mainly for solid fuel, the other for liquids only)      digester. The double container resembles an ordinary septic      tank, with two important differences. First, Grahame's      version is airtight to provide a happy home for the      bacteria that convert part of the raw sewage and garbage      into methane. Also, since the optimum temperature for the      gas-producing bugs is between 70° and 95°      Fahrenheit, the receptacle is insulated and equipped with a      solar heating panel. (For more details on methane      production by anaerobic bacteria, see THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS, NOS. 3, 12 and 18.)    </p>    <p>      The material from the liquid compartment in the digester      next passes to another tank . . . this time airy and sunlit      to accommodate the tiny, fast-multiplying algae plants that      devour organic matter still in the waste. The algae also      add oxygen that helps bacteria digest the sewage and      nitrogen that enriches the end product (which eventually      becomes plant food). Also, any dangerous microorganisms in      the human excreta portion of the sewage should perish at      this stage, killed by the oxygen and the ultraviolet      radiation of the sun.    </p>    <p>      Since the algae need warmth, as well as light and air,      Grahame will keep them comfortable in the dull, cold London      winter by extending part of their tank into his house in      the form of a loop. This indoor section of the algae pool      is to be continuously illuminated with electric light (only      500 foot-candles are needed, so one 40-watt fluorescent      tube should suffice).    </p>    <p>      When the plants have done their work, the liquid passes      on-algae and all-to a final tank . . . another      digester in which the contents are kept at 110° F by      means of a solar panel. This temperature kills the algae      (which are soon replaced by the fast-growing colony in the      open pool) and decomposes them to furnish more methane.    </p>    <p>      The gas from the first and second digesters collects in the      tops of the tanks and is piped to Grahame's kitchen stove .      . . which will also have cylinders of store-bought fuel      standing by, since the young designer has no illusions      about how much methane a single person's wastes can      produce. To be precise, some large sewage-disposal outfits      (which use methane to run their power plants) count on one      cubic foot of gas from each individual's daily wastes.      Though Grahame expects to do better than that-since      he'll be using kitchen garbage as well as sewage-he      certainly won't be able to heat the house, run an electric      generator or fuel a car from his output. He'll be lucky if      he gets enough to cook with. A family or commune, of      course, would produce more methane and would also use it      more efficiently, since approximately the same amount of      fuel goes into cooking one potato or ten.    </p>    <p>      And what about the liquid that remains in the second      digester after the methane is piped off? That's Grahame's      plant food . . . his replacement for the mixture of      commercial fertilizers that's normally used in hydroponic      gardening. If Caine finds that he can rely on the algae      pool to free his personal wastes of harmful bacteria before      the sewage is passed on to the greenhouse, he'll have      attained one of his ideals: a complete cycle of organic      material based on the interaction of plant and animal life      as it occurs in nature.    </p>    <p>      As you may know, waste-recycling dwellings are being      attempted in our own country (see "Grassy Brook Village" in      LIFESTYLE! NO. 2 for a description of one such effort). The      main difficulty is keeping the digester tanks at their      correct temperatures, since they might overheat in the      southern summer and-though they generate some heat of      their own-require protection and added warmth in the      cold North. (One possible solution is to surround the tank      with a warm-water jacket.) Anyone who imitated Grahame's      use of an algae pool in a severe climate would also have to      take extra measures to keep the plants alive during the      winter.    </p>    <h3>      THE GREENHOUSE    </h3>    <p>      The cycle of organic material in Grahame's ecosystem is      completed in a 500-square-foot greenhouse next to Caine's      own living space. Here the vegetables the young architect      will rely on for his main food source, and the flowers he's      planting among them just for fun, will be raised      hydroponically with household wastes for their fertilizer.      (This inventive Englishman has even planned a      hothouse-above the main growing space to catch the      rising heat-where he intends to cultivate bananas and      other tropical fruit.)    </p>    <p>      Hydroponics, as it's usually practiced, is the antithesis      of organic gardening because the plants live in an inert      medium like sand and are nourished entirely by a water      solution that contains plant food. The      technique-though valuable in lab studies of plant      nutrition-is seldom used commercially except      sometimes to produce fine chrysanthemums and other flowers.      Because my own feeling is that organically grown food      tastes better than hydroponic products, I'd be interested      to know whether Grahame obtains any improvement in flavor      by watering the plants with natural instead of synthetic      fertilizers . . . an innovation that brings these two      schools of gardening a step closer together.    </p>    <p>      In any case, people who have no soil-because their      land is hard rock, too full of moisture or otherwise not      tillable-could certainly grow their food by Grahame's      method where an organic garden would be impossible.    </p>    <p>      Grahame expects 250 square feet of cultivated space in his      greenhouse to provide him with eight pounds of vegetables      per square foot . . . enough to feed him all year round      with no trouble. I myself question the need for so much      indoor growing area, because in most cultivated regions an      outdoor garden will produce enough of many vegetables      (potatoes, for instance) to last the winter. On the other      hand, the greenhouse does allow controlled growing      conditions and more efficient recycling of waste . . . and      this is probably important in a demonstration project like      the Eco-House.    </p>    <p>      If you want to follow Grahame's example and grow all your      own food under shelter, you'll need to work out the space      requirements carefully. For instance, a family of four      would require 1,000 square feet of greenhouse space. A      structure, let's say, 20 X 50 feet . . . which is perfectly      practical now that large plastic sheets are cheap and      readily available.    </p>    <p>      Your local climate, however, may force you to make some      alterations in the greenhouse project. While a solar-heated      growing area is practical all year round in England, the      extremely cold winters of the Northern States and Canada      would require artificial heat for the plants during the      coldest months of the year. Certainly, it would be      difficult to make Caine's overhead hothouse work when the      outdoor temperature is zero. <em>(New Alchemy Institute      East</em> - <em>located on Cape Cod</em> -      <em>is experimenting with winter indoor growing      environments that also incorporate fish and animals.</em>      <em>See LIFESTYLE! .NO.</em> <em>-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE SUN AS A HEATER    </h3>    <p>      Naturally, Grahame will have to keep himself warm, as well      as his plants, and he'll need hot water for household use.      He plans to fill both these needs-partly,      anyhow-by trapping the heat of the sun in an array of      black-painted hot-water radiators (the kind that are used      for central heating) on the south wall of his dwelling . .      . though it seems to me that a 100-foot coil of black      plastic pipe would be simpler, cheaper and lighter. While      an April test run for this system produced a hot-bath      temperature of 140° F in a 30-gallon tank of water,      this result can't be hoped for in winter, especially during      the long gloomy periods which are common in England.      Therefore, Caine is hooking into the public electricity      supply as a backup source of heat until he gets started      making his own power.    </p>    <p>      And how about using Grahame's hot-water system in this      country? Well, in the South, of course, his form of solar      heating is perfectly practical . . . and even in the North,      on a bright day in January or February, the sun can feel      very warm in a sheltered spot. Apart from the fact that      such bright days are none too common in some parts of the      country, though, the difficulty is the coldness of the air.      The radiators could, of course, be placed behind a screen      which would allow them to collect the sun's heat without      losing to the air more warmth than they gain . . . but,      even so, there's still the problem of keeping the water      from freezing overnight. Still, as the article on "Grassy      Brook Village" in LIFESTYLE! NO. 2 shows, solar      heating-in a somewhat different form-is being      attempted in the cold climate of Vermont.    </p>    <h3>      POWER    </h3>    <p>      Grahame is using public-utility electricity at the outset      to light his Eco-House and-as I've said-to help      his radiator array on cold days. Eventually, however, he      hopes to install a wind generator and power-storage system      to make the house independent of the electric grid and      fossil fuels.    </p>     <p>      When he does undertake this project, I'll be interested to      know how he tackles the problem of storing energy for      windless days. This is the difficulty that every user of      alternative power runs into. To show you its dimensions,      I'll use my own house for an example, even though I don't      heat electrically: Just 1,000 square feet of old      farmhouse-well insulated-needs the equivalent      of 20 kilowatts of heat during the coldest days of winter.      Now, to store 20 kilowatts as electricity for one hour      would require 20 car batteries . . . and, to provide for      three consecutive windy days, you'd need 1,440 of the      storage units!    </p>    <p>      In short, there's a great reward coming to anyone who      devises a practical, light, small energy store. The      standard car battery holds about 1 kilowatt-hour or 1-1/3      horsepowerhours. What we need is a device that will cost no      more, occupy the same space and contain at least 10 and      preferably 100 kilowatt-hours.    </p>    <p>      Since no such device now exists, though, let's look at some      of the alternatives Grahame might use when he undertakes to      make his own power.    </p>    <p>      Grahame could-for instance-use the windmill's      energy to heat water to a temperature of 80° to      180° F, by means of a 20-kilowatt immersion heater      that's made for this purpose. Power stored in this form      won't light Caine's house, but it <em>will</em> give him      heat. How long it will do so depends on the volume of his      storage area. A tank of 125 cubic feet will hold 230      kilowatt-hours . . . one of 500 cubic feet, nearly 1,000      kilowatt-hours . . . and a container of 800 cubic feet (10      X 10 X 8 feet) will retain enough warmth to keep a house      the size of mine comfortable in the depth of winter for      three days.    </p>    <p>      In many ways, water is an attractive heat store. It's safe,      and-in most areas-it's cheap and plentiful.      What's more, it can act as its own pump and will heat the      radiators in a house by thermosiphoning. However, it does      have a couple of drawbacks: It's bulky, and it won't store      heat above water's boiling point. (If you hold power as      steam under pressure, the Man will-rightly-send      his inspector 'round to see that your "pressure vessel"      isn't a danger to you or to innocent bystanders.)    </p>    <p>      Sand, used as a heat store, can outperform water by holding      a much higher temperature . . . but bulk for bulk it will      retain only half as much warmth. What's more, it won't      flow. To get the heat into the sand in the first place,      then, Grahame would need something more complex than a      common immersion heater, and he'd also have to devise a      network of pipes or the like to get it out. In short, I'm      dubious about the sand storage idea in practice.    </p>    <p>      Well, as you can see, it's quite a challenge to overcome      the sporadic nature of wind power and turn its energy into      a reliable household servant. Still, Grahame Caine is an      inventive man, and maybe his solution to the power-storage      problem will be as novel as his use of algae in the      Eco-House's waste-recycling system. This, and the other      ideas he'll be working on during his life on that corner of      land in Greenwich, may go a long way toward freeing us all      from the cumbersome wastefulness that's built into modern      housing.    </p>    <p>      Many of us think a new kind of housing design is long      overdue in our society . . . and, to judge from the      response Grahame's been getting from official circles in      London, at least some urban authorities are worried enough      to agree. Just possibly, then, the Caine Eco-House may turn      out to be one revolutionary idea that came along at exactly      the right time.    </p>
