        Simple construction of swiming arrangement for both ducks and geese. Pekin ducks require swimming water if they are to reproduce... however, Muscovy ducks do not need water. Both breeds, however, do much better when swimming is available. Size of swimming pool will depend on number of ducks kept... however, it is important that draining facilities are supplied as the swimming pool should be cleaned regularly as needed.
