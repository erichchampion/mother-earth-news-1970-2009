    <p>
                    <p>      All cattle can be fattened by careful feeding, but the      muscular development and mix of fat and lean that make for      best eating are found in breeds that are meant for beef      rather than for milk production. If you know you'll be      doing your own butchering, then, you might consider      breeding a dairy cow or two to a beef bull.    </p>    <p>      Prime beef comes from a quickly fattened steer or heifer      between a year and a half and two and a half years old.      Look for a sleek, vigorous animal with a broad, deep body      that's well filled out and covered with a smooth layer of      fat. The ideal weight is about 800 pounds . . . and, since      you want as much as possible of that mass to be edible,      it's best to avoid a critter with heavy bones.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, the health of a meat animal is of first      importance. Watch the beast you plan to butcher for several      days before you actually kill the animal to make sure it      looks well and behaves normally. If there's any doubt about      its condition, check with your veterinarian. When the      carcass is opened, look carefully for signs of      tuberculosis: pockets of pus or granular material on the      lungs, liver or spleen and possibly hanging from the ribs.      If you find such traces, the carcass needn't be a total      loss-you can boil it until the meat falls from the      bones and feed it to chickens or hogs-but handle it      with care to avoid infection. It's best to wear gloves, and      to sterilize all tools after using them.    </p>    <p>      If you have to kill an animal because it's injured, bleed      it at once to avoid spoilage and discoloration of the      tissues and then handle it just like a slaughtered carcass      . . . but if the critter died of overheat, its meat is      unfit for human use (though it too can be boiled for      livestock feed).    </p>    <p>      To prepare an animal for slaughtering, put it by itself in      a clean pen (or shelter if the weather is hot, cold or wet)      for at least 24 hours. Keep it quiet and give it water but      no food . . . and you'll also do well to clean its coat so      that the meat won't be contaminated when you skin the      carcass later. Remember that beef from an animal that's      bruised, hot or excited-or has just eaten      heavily-will discolor and be quick to spoil.    </p>    <p>      If you're butchering in warm weather, it's best to kill in      the evening and hang the carcass to cool overnight (but      take it down early next morning before flies gather).      During cold weather, of course, you can make your kill at      any time of day. Pick a clean spot outdoors and rig a block      and tackle over a strong tree branch or wooden tripod 15      feet high. Do your slaughtering with the help of this setup      and you won't damage the carcass by dragging it.    </p>    <p>      Cattle to be killed are brought down either by shooting      with a small-Caliber rifle or stunning with a sledge or axe      that weighs four to six pounds. (If you stun, it's      advisable to tie the animal with its head down and to      blindfold it.) Whichever method you use, draw an imaginary      line from each eye to the opposite horn and aim at the      point where the lines cross.    </p>    <p>      When the beast is stunned and lying on the ground, put your      back to the body, set one foot against its forelegs and      force the head back as far as you can with the other. Then      use a sharp knife to cut along the bottom of the neck for      10 to 15 inches from the breastbone forward, deep enough to      expose the windpipe without piercing it. Next insert the      knife to one side of the windpipe-with the back of      the blade against the breastbone-and press the point      toward the spine to a depth of about four inches to cut the      carotid arteries and jugular veins.    </p>    <p>      A good bleed is important . . . you can help drain the      carcass by putting one foot on the paunch of the carcass      and pulling up on the tail with a pumping motion.    </p>
