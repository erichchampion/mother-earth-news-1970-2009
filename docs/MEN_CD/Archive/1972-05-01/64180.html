                    <p>      Harold Bate has made a great contribution to the world by      publicizing the fact that you and I can operate our      automobiles on low-emission fuel. His suggestion that we      can actually produce one of those      fuels-methane-from barnyard manure is also very      exciting . . . but my experience leads me to believe that      the famous patented Bate Autogas Convertor Device, designed      to allow a standard automobile to run on methane, is not      practical at all.    </p>    <p>      First, there's the problem of obtaining methane. The      natural gas (which is mostly methane) companies I've      contacted indicate that they're not yet set up to make      their product readily available to automobiles. And, even      equipped with Bate's instructions, not many of us have      access to the manure (it takes five pounds to produce      methane equivalent to one gallon of gasoline) and can spare      the space and resources to build a digester-compressor.    </p>    <p>      Second, if you do succeed in obtaining or producing the      gas, you'll find your car won't have much range unless you      get a really strong tank and a compressor to force in lots      of methane under pressure. Forget all talk of carrying the      gas in balloons, bottles or whatever unless you plan to      stay extremely close to your fuel source. At that, you      won't be either safe or legal unless you've got the methane      in a good, solid, pressed-steel tank equipped with      excess-pressure relief valve, positive lock-off, etc. as      required by law and common sense.    </p>    <p>      Third, instructions accompanying the Bate unit state that      "gas pressure from the bottle (to the convertor) should not      exceed approximately 70 pounds per square inch" . . . so if      you intend to compress your methane for range, you'll need      a regulator in the line between the gas tank and the Bate      Convertor. As a matter of fact, because methane pressure      varies noticeably with changes in outside temperature and      fuel level and because the Bate Convertor is sensitive to      these changes, you'll need a regulator to stabilize the gas      pressure anyway.    </p>    <p>      Fourth, Bate's unit offers no automatic or other positive      shut-off protection in case the convertor leaks when your      automobile's engine isn't running. I ran a test on the Bate      device I had and, sure enough, it did leak under such      conditions. That's dangerous.    </p>    <p>      Finally, the Bate Convertor is a real disappointment when      operated with propane. Try as I might, I just couldn't get      the unit to work on the combination propane/butane that's      marketed as LP here in the U.S. The problem was that the LP      tank and valves froze when vapor was drawn off quickly at      high speeds and-the lower the fuel level-the      more quickly the LP froze. It seems that (according to the      people who handle LP conversions) the fuel must be drawn      off as a <em>liquid</em> and then allowed to expand into a      gas in a heat exchanger that the Bate unit, of course, does      not have.    </p>    <p>      All in all, the Bate gadget is simply a single-stage demand      regulator that must be supported by at least $150 in extra      equipment if it's to work satisfactorily (even with      compressed methane).    </p>    <p>      Automobiles definitely <em>can</em> be operated on methane,      propane and other low-emission fuels . . . but-like      it or not-the answer seems to lie in one of the      commercially available, double-stage convertors (such as      Century or Impco) that come with heat exchanger, manual or      electrical solenoid primer, complete service instructions      and parts list. So we might as well do it right in the      first place. With the proper equipment <em>and for little      more than the real total cost of a Bate conversion</em> ,      you'll wind up with a system that'll handle methane,      butane, propane-you name it-without any      extensive changes or extra parts. And <em>that's</em> when      you'll begin to save dollars as you cut your car's      contribution to pollution.    </p>
