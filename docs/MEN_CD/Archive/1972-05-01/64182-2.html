        <p>12. The gasoline fuel lock ( -&gt; ) is installed between the gasoline fuel line and the carburetor. 13. Overview of dual-fuel conversion through the water lines and lockoff installation stage. 14. The top of the Imperial mixer and air cleaner is removed so mixer can be installed on adapter. 15. A Boden choke wire is connected to the mixer. It is used to open the mixer to allow for increased intake of air when the engine is operating on gasoline. 16. Imperial mixer installed on carburetor. 17. The conversion under the hood is completed with the installation of the liquid hose to the fuel filter lockoff, the vapor hose ( -&gt; ) and electrical wiring. 18. In this particular vehicle, the spare tire brackets in the trunk had to be removed. Special attention should be given passenger cars having rearwindow defrosters ( -&gt; ) or rear-radio speakers. They should be sealed or removed. If a manifolded tank arrangement is installed, the "hidden" tank should be ordered smaller to accommodate defrosters or speakers. 19. All tank fittings must be checked and tightened before tank is installed. Special attention to small Allen wrench pipe plugs (-&gt; ) should be given as some have been leakers. 20. The including of an electric fuel gauge as part of passenger car installations is recommended. Electrical wiring in trunk spaces should be positioned out of the way so as not to become easily snagged. The wire connection to the repeater gauge mounted on the dash can be placed under the vehicle's floor carpets to make a neater installation. 21. Stainless steel wire braid hose( -&gt; ) is recommended for fuel lines on all propane carburetion installations. Optional equipment installed on a motor fuel tank can include a vapor takeoff valve ( -&gt; ) so the tank can be used to fuel portable LP-gas burning appliances.</p>
