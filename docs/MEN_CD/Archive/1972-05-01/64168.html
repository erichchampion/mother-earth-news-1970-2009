                		<h5 id="byline">      by old jan adkins    </h5>            <p>      <em><strong>E</strong></em> ach small bay scallop yields a      single nugget of light, opalescent meat that is unsurpassed      by any sea food for flavor and delicacy. Saute'ed or      lightly broiled, they are rich and rare gift from the      generous shore. the opening of scallop season in mid-autumn      spreads townfolk on the water like oil spills, and into a      light winter professional fishermen are dragging their      limit through the snow flurries. In New England's shallow      waters, the bay scallop is a prime cash crop.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>T</strong></em> he general home shellfishing      license usually allows a weekly scallop catch of one      bushel. A separate commercial license, however, allows a      daily bag limit per license aboard, two licensees per boat      (fee for the Buzzard's Bay aree is around $40, state and      local). The shellfish wardens who enforce the codes are as      cunning and stealthy as the old rumrunners, so exceeding      the limit is risky, as well as bad ecology.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>S</em></strong> callops seem to be the only      bivalves with the ability tomove about readily, and hence,      may be found on many kinds of bottom at many depths. They      seem to be herded by the action of wind, tide, and current,      and so the native has the advantage of close local      knowledge Three solutions: spot fish until you find the      grounds; inspect the bottom before the season with a      watercress or a diver; follow the fleet and advice of the      friends you must make among the professional fishermen...      no article or book can offer more than direction and an      overview-the fishermen can show you how it really      works.    </p>                     <p>      a <em><strong>D</strong></em> redge is an important piece      of comercial equipment and an impressive investment (~$75      new). It is shackled to heavy nylon line and dragged behind      a skiff along the bottom, until full, emptied, and towed      again. Hauling it onto the deck at the end of a drag is wet      work, cold in the late autumn, and foul weather      gear-especially the rubberized bib-overalls and      neoprene gloves-is a part of your investment.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>n</em></strong> <em>on-commercial scallopers      fish the shallows at low tide from a skiff or in high      waders, using a dip net or a quayhog rake with a      basket.</em>    </p>                   <p>      <strong><em>g</em></strong> <em>etting the scallops is only      half the job; they must be shucked. Ony the adductor muscle      is eaten, the rest is discarded (or used as fertilizer,      organs and degradable shell-available in quantity for the      hauling away from professional scallopers. The scallop is      held firmly and a dull round-bladed (~2") knife is inserted      just forward of the hinge - it is twisted to break the      hinge. The blade is slipped under the organs at the rear      and, with blade and thumb the organs are flipped forward,      separating from the muscle, which is left to be detached      and dropped into a pail with a scrape of the round      blade.</em>    </p>

Remember, though that sailboats and powerboats maneuver differently, and that you are encroaching on the professional's domain.
