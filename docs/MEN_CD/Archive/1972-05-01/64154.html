    <p>
                    <p>      I joined the Ecological Food Society after reading their ad      <em>in The New York Times.</em> At the time, they were      offering a free pint of Shaklee's Basic-H and as a Shaklee      distributor, I was pleased to see them handling our      products.    </p>    <p>      Three or four months after I sent my check. I received my      first option list, a letter of apology and a four-ounce      plastic bottle of Earth-1. The attached note said that      since Shaklee was unwilling to reveal the ingredients in      Basic-H, EFS had severed connections with the company.      However, I noticed that the bottle of Earth-1 didn't list      ingredients or even give the manufacturer's name, and the      option list contained pictures of Shaklee products with the      name scratched out.    </p>    <p>      During the time of my association with EFS, I never      received any information about organic growers in my area,      and their DDT-less apple was as elusive as their impressive      board of advisers.    </p>    <p>      Minette Rowley<br />      Rumney, N.H.    </p>    <p>      It would appear to me that Mr. Schiff and Mr. Brown might      have engaged in a little Madison Avenue leg pulling when      they described how the Ecological Food Society tests its      wares for contamination (MOTHER NO. 13). First. of all, a      $5,000 gas chromatograph can be considered a toy      (especially in the hands of an amateur) when it comes to      trace-residue analyses. Second, to test a single      apple-and EFS apparently claims to test one out of      every bushel-would involve something like $1,000      worth of lab work. (Remember, one must look more closely,      than the FDA, which checks-if at all-only for      amounts in excess of the allowable residues normally left      after pesticide use.) Third, I doubt that there's a      qualified chemist in the country who would guarantee, on      the basis of testing alone that pesticides      <em>absolutely</em> had not been used on a product. .    </p>    <p>      If you want pure food, I recommend gnawing it . . . there's      more to food than the eating of it. If this isn't possible,      why not buy it an a one-to-one basis from someone local?      It's hard to believe that "front money" and "private      investors" are necessary in order to get your hands on a      few clean carrots.    </p>    <p>      Harry Ellery<br />      Vice President. Cory Laboratories, Inc.<br />      Menominee, Mich.    </p>    <p>      It is a shame that the organic movement is open to      exploitation by profit seekers who profess to be working      for change. There are many conscientious people wits are      genuinely concerned woith solving environmental problems      but don't know exactly what to do . . . it's among these      folks that the Ecological Food Society saws its oats.    </p>    <p>      I saw the DDT-less apple ad its PSYCHOLOGY TODAY over a      year ago and enthusiastically sent my $5.00 to EFS. For      months, all I got were apologies and order forms for the      most ridiculous (organic deodorants) and overpackaqed      supplies , . . and never have I received an option to buy      anything to live on except apples, almond butter and honey      (all overpriced). All in all, I've had no indication that      the EFS is doing anything positive except making money      (like they say in your "Plowboy Interview", they're      <em>not</em> non-profit),    </p>    <p>      Michael F. Zinn<br />      Organic Energy Co-op<br />      Fresh Meadows, Queens, N.Y,    </p>    <p>      I f you had doubts about whether the Ecological Food      Society was "on the level", wouldn't it have been a good      idea to join for a while and check it out instead of simply      interviewing its organizers? Two of us have been members of      EFS since early 1971, and we consider it a classic rip-off.    </p>    <p>      At the same time that the EFS people were running a heavy      ad campaign for new members, they were sending old members      profuse apologies for the lousy service, using the huge and      unexpected response to their first ad as an excuse, Why      didn't they stop advertising until they got caught up?    </p>    <p>      Their "catalog" comes irregularly maybe three times a year      and contains about fifteen items, many of which are useless      gadgets, Neither of us has ever received any kind of a      newsletter, let alone a 90-page one, although one of us did      get a copy of NATURAL LIFE STYLES (first issue) from EFS .      . , and if they're claiming that as their newsletter, it's      downright dishonest.    </p>    <p>      One reason we joined EFS was that they promised to provide      practical advice on stuff to buy and to avoid in the      supermarket . . . they have never sent any of that kind of      information.    </p>    <p>      Ann Howe<br />      Andrea Marciano<br />      Cortland, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      Got my letter to the Ecological Food Society back today      with the envelope stamped "out of business". Is the EFS      defunct, moved, or . . .?    </p>    <p>      Fred Scott<br />      Dresden, Ontario    </p>    <p>      <em>What follows is an exchange between</em>      <em>disappointed EFS member Bink Williams aid Steve Brown,      president of Schiff/Brown & Co. (the New York ad agency      behind EFS).</em>    </p>    <p>      I read your interview in MOTHER NO. 13 with interest, Mr.      Brown, since my wife and I joined the EFS over a year ago      in hopes of establishing a supply of organic grains,      fruits, etc. We have been disappointed with the selection      of things offered for sale-mostly dried fruit,      vitamins, candy and nuts (the Christmas apples were a      welcome change)-and have found most items to be      consistently more expansive than what's available locally.    </p>    <p>      For example, we have spring water delivered for 31 cents a      gallon (not 80 cents to $5.00) , . , and why the oversell      on purifiers? Certainty portable water purifiers can be      valuable to those trapped in the city, but for your ad to      imply that water thus purified is equivalent in nourishment      to living spring water is a bit absurd (and your      replacement filter costs $3.49, not $1.00).    </p>    <p>      The one item-an organic cosmetics kit-that I      did order from EFS has never come, despite the fact that I      sent for it the day after receiving the Christmas option      list (promising Christmas delivery), On January 11, 1972 I      wrote to EFS requesting either immediate delivery or a      refund and expressing our disappointment. We still haven't      heard a word.    </p>    <p>      All in all, your ideas look great on paper, but something      is keeping them from becoming manifest. Just growing pains,      I hope. See you on the mountain top.    </p>    <p>      Bink Williams<br />      New Orleans, La.    </p>    <p>      Thanks for your letter, even if it was only to let us know      haw we seem to have messed up in your case, Unfortunately,      one of the disadvanages in not running an (IBM-type      operation is that you don't get IBM efficiency (if there is      such a thing). Anyway, I am personally looking into what      happened to your order.    </p>    <p>      But now to some other questions you raise, which have to be      answered if we are not to come off as charlatans (even      though you were nice enough not to actually state the only      conclusion that logically followed from your letter),    </p>    <p>      While I'm glad you liked the apples offered for Christmas,      I'm sorry you are not a dried fruit-vitamin-nut lover. Our      selections are not made an the basis of gustatory appeal      alone . . . we have to balance that against what's      available that comes up to our standards. Which brings me      to our prices.    </p>    <p>      We have stated in our correspondence with members that our      prices might often seem way out of fine . . . and they      <em>were</em> high at first. Often, the only things we      could certify as being of the quality we said they were      cost us an arm and a leg (for a variety of reasons you may      or may not be aware of), and then we had to add on our      (minimal) 29 to 38% markup.    </p>    <p>      However, as soon as we had solved the quality problem and      had a secure base for a certain item, we set about cutting      consumer casts. In some cases, we lowered prices about 40%      (without being asked) because our new volume allowed us to      twist arms and hold out rewards to those who would      manufacture to all our specifications. We even sent back      refunds (on Vitamin. C, on Shampoo, on water purifiers) to      members who had ordered at the higher price because we had      managed to reduce our cost in the interim, What other      company in the entire country does nutty things like that?    </p>    <p>      If you still find our prices higher than those in your      locality, well . . . I don't want to make generalized      assertions about health food stores, but certainly you are      aware that <em>even the honest proprietors</em> have no      sure way of knowing that what they sell is any good. The      Society, on the other hand, is committed to checking out      all products before selling them. Our prices may be high,      but we <em>know</em> what we're dealing in and how good it      is. Of course, if your local source is one you can depend      on, by all means use it . . . our members generally don't      have such sources available, and it's for them that the      Society is most valuable.    </p>    <p>      About that water purifier . , . the      spring-water-versus-filtered-water controversy is still      going on. One ironic fact that you may want to consider is      this: city-treated water is, I agree, usually horrible and      full of chemicals <em>but</em> those chemicals have killed      all harmful organic matter (such as the coliform and other      bacteria), which even spring water sometimes contains. If      you filter this treated water in your home, you just may      wind up with the best of both worlds: bacteria-free as well      as chemical-free water.    </p>    <p>      You're right . . . our replacement filter is $3.49, not $1.      00 as incorrectly stated in the MOTHER article (by the way,      there were encouragingly few errors in that article). I      also did not-unless I was "somewhere else"-say      that bottled water sells for $5.00 a gallon. . . $1.00 a      gallon is the highest price I've seen so far.    </p>    <p>      Hope that this has answered some of your questions. Let's      leave it at my telling you that we're doing our best and      you, maybe, replying that it isn't good enough. Unhappily,      you may be right.    </p>    <p>      If you get to the mountain top and don't see us there, be      patient . . . sit down, sip some cider and wait just a bit.    </p>    <p>      Steve Brown<br />      Ecological Food Society    </p>    <p>      <em>Since the "Plowboy Interview" with EPS founders Victor      Schiff and Steve Brown appeared in MOTHER NO. 13, a number      of readers have insisted that EFS hasn't been living up to      its promises. So in mid-March we hopefully sent a letter to      Steve summarizing the complaints we'd received and      including' copies of several examples, A second less      hopeful note went out several weeks later. Still no answer.      . . although neither letter was returned. However, when we      tried to cold Schiff/Brown , we were told that the phone      had been disconnected Then at the eleventh hour, so to      speak, the following letter arrived from Steve.</em>    </p>    <p>      Sorry to take so long in answering you but things are in a      gigantic mess not only with the Ecological Food Society but      also with our other businesses, which we have drained of      money and deprived of attention in order to keep EFS going.      But that's <em>our</em> problem. Now to your problem, and      that of your readers.    </p>    <p>      First, EPS is not only broke but about $180,000 in the      hole. The doors have been padlocked by the Internal Revenue      Service for non-payment of some taxes, and the mail is not      being delivered. to us by the post office.    </p>    <p>      Believe it or not, this does not mean that EFS officially      out of business. There have been lots of sweet-talking      "nice guys" who wanted to buy EFS and, "out of the goodness      of their hearts", continue the "good work" and all that      crap. However, we figured if we went broke we might as well      do it as honestly as possible, without lending our names      whatever they're worth-to something shady.    </p>    <p>      Finally one group, representing a public company, has put      its money, where its mouth is and provided postage to get      packages out to members as of March, 17, 1972. They are      also authorizing refunds and/or credits: for whatever else      is owed. As of this daze (March 30, 1972), it appears that      EFS will resume operations (with an outside, hard-nose type      in charge of finances, thank heavens) and make good on all      its promises and materials as soon as is humanly possible.      Those members who want, to stick around and see . . . well,      we'll be grateful. Those who are fed up (and not without      good reason) can, of course, take their money and run.    </p>    <p>      By the way, Schiff/Brown Advertising is in the same boat as      EFS with offices locked and a deficit of $94,000 owed to it      by the Society, so if you think anybody's gotten as      ripped-off as we have, you're nuts. Victor and I did not      take a penny out of EFS (it's an open corporation and this      is a matter of record); on the contrary, we sank every      penny we had-privately and otherwise-into an      attempt to make it go. In February, we even took our last      few hundred bucks in personal savings and bought postage to      get out as many back orders and materials as we could.      Thousands of packages were all ready to go (partly because      we had gone upstate and packed the darned things ourselves      after there was no money left to pay the shipping people)      but until then we hadn't been able to raise the postage      money.    </p>    <p>      Now, in opposition to what some of your reader complaints      say, we did mail out the EFS newsletter . . . 22,000      copies. One was a six-page letter (with photographs)      containing such items as our testing procedure with the gas      chromatograph (incidentally we did not, as your article      reported, say we tested an apple a bushel since this would      have cost more than the national debt as one of your      readers pointed out) and a lead article on stilbestrol that      we feel had some part in prompting subsequent government      action.    </p>    <p>      We also mailed put a 90-page <em>GUIDE TO ORGANIC      LIVING</em> which, despite some confusion, we arranged to      have prepared for us by the staff of NATURAL LIFE STYLES.      We sent out 12,000 of those GUIDES and have had another      11,000 sitting in a mailing house since June, 1971 waiting      for postage.    </p>    <p>      The Shaklee story was as I stated it , . . they would not      disclose their ingredients so we manufactured our own      "detergent" (Earth-1) and put a full list of ingredients on      each bottle. Of course, I say one thing and your readers      say another. Whom to believe? Well, if I can get back into      my offices, i'll try to send you an Earth-1 label/brochure.    </p>    <p>      Why did we keep running ads when we were having difficulty      servicing the members we already had? Well (strange as it      may seem), we didn't really know we were having difficulty.      Only toward the end of 1971 (six months after your      interview was actually taped) did we start running into      snags . . . for example, manufacturers who demanded cash up      front instead of giving the usual 30 to 60 days' credit, I      guess the beard and sneakers didn't look like good business      risks (evidently they weren't?). Also, our underwriter, who      was supposed to have delivered $350,000 in bridge financing      to EFS in May of 1971 (this would have put it on solid      ground) inexplicably broke up with his partner and left us      high and dry. When it finally became clear that we couldn't      do right by the members we had, we stopped soliciting new      ones. But as you know, some ad insertions must be in as      long as three months before the date of publication and in      that time a lot can-and did-happen.    </p>    <p>      I don't know if I've answered all your questions, but      thanks for asking before busting. Keep up the goad work of      "throwin' the rascals out". . . even if they torn out to be      me.    </p>    <p>      Steve Blown<br />      Ecological Food Society    </p>
