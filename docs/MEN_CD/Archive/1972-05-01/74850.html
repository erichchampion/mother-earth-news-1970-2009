                    <h5 id="byline">      by MIKEKIERNAN:</h5>    <h3>A AS INAPOCALYPSE</h3>    <p>      <em>WASHINGTON-The World could be as little as 50 or      60 years</em> <em>from a disastrous new ice age, a leading      atmospheric scientist predicts.</em> Washington Post,      <em>July</em> <em>9, 1971.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>WASHINGTON-Fifty U.S. scientists called yesterday      for a high</em> <em>priority study of everything man dumps      into the oceans, "before</em> <em>we are surprised by a      disaster".</em> Washington Post <em>, January 15, 1972</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>ROME-The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization      just issued</em> <em>a report for the coming Stockholm      conference saying that the human race is going to run short      of water within a century.</em> Washington Post,      <em>February 28, 1972.</em>    </p>    <p>      In earlier, more placid times, one would come across the      above clippings only by chance . . . say at the dentist's      office while leafing through the austere (and boring) pages      of SATURDAY REVIEW. Now such stories are splashed      continually across the fronts of newspapers in every part      of the world and cannot be ignored.    </p>    <p>      Predictions of environmental doom are reported more      frequently these days for a variety of reasons. First,      there are many more predictions to announce. Second,      today's forecasts usually represent a consensus of opinion      among a large group of scientists rather than (as formerly)      the views of an individual. Third, the predictions are now      generally backed with a thick volume of research and the      media is impressed. Which is to say that, in the past,      reporters usually had to hoodwink reluctant scientists into      making sensational remarks. Now those remarks are both      well-documented and freely made.    </p>    <p>      Although stories like those quoted above all pack a wallop,      the layman still finds himself wishing for something more .      . . one longs for the complete picture, the <em>consummate      report</em> that puts the Apocalypse into proper      perspective. And that complete picture is now here . . .      not once, but twice.    </p>    <p>      In the past few months two reports have been published that      set their sights deadringer on the Big-A. Both papers lay      it right on the line and <em>-</em> in effect      <em>-</em> claim that unless man radically reduces      the rate of industrialization and worldwide population      growth, our children's children will witness the Second      Coming: "Mere anarchy," as Yeats put it, "loosed upon the      world."    </p>    <p>      The first report, entitled "Blueprint for Survival,"      appeared in mid-January in the British journal, THE      ECOLOGIST. In 22 pages of text and graphs, the magazine's      editors and consultants pointed out in considerable detail      that the demand for resources and food is growing      exponentially (that is, multiplying at a rapidly increasing      rate) and that the pressures arising from such growth can      only lead to war, mass starvation and general chaos.    </p>    <p>      "If we allow the present growth rate to persist on a      worldwide basis," say the authors, "the total ecological      demand will increase by a factor of 32 over the next 66      years . . . if current trends are allowed to persist, the      breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the      life-support systems on this planet, possibly by the end of      the century, certainly within the lifetimes of our      children, are inevitable."    </p>    <p>      To avoid catastrophe, the authors recommend that the      British people stop building roads and having so many      babies... and start taxing th use of power and raw      materials Britain should seek to stabilize its population      at around 30 million within the next two centuries . . . in      other words cut its present population of 55 million in      half.    </p>    <p>      Above all, Blueprint for Survival states that Britain and      the rest of the developed world must curb its ravenous      appetite for continuous growth. The Gross National Product,      it is implied, should become subject to Gross International      Welfare    </p>    <p>      The report, of course, has received a good bit of      criticism. The editor of the rival scientific magazine,      NATURE, called the Blueprint "half-baked" and "simplistic".      Others said was it "naive . . . overstated". But 33 leading      British scientists, including biologist Sir Julian Huxley,      endorsed the paperbasic principles of reducing population      growth and challenging indiscriminate technology.    </p>    <p>      Six weeks after the sensational Blueprint for Survival was      published, the Club of Rome-a prestigious group of 75      scientists from <em>25</em> countries-issued its      first in a series of documents on the predicament of      mankind. The paper is entitled <em>LIMITS TO GROWTH</em>      (Potomac Associates/Universe Books, 205pp., $2.75) and the      highly readable study is not being ballyhooed as a      radically new theoretical study of the biosphere.    </p>    <p>      The authors of <em>LIMITS TO GROWTH</em> (the majority are      from MIT) have reduced trends in world population,      industrialization, pollution, food production and resource      depletion to simple mathematical models and stuck them into      a compute. After examining the results of several different      computer runs, the scientists concluded that, if the five      trends continue unchecked, "the limits to growth on this      planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred      years".    </p>    <p>      In what it calls "the standard world model run" in which      the present social, economic and physical relationships      remain unchanged, the Club of Rome report predicts a      fantastic collapse of society. Like the British study, the      computer envisions hundreds of millions starving to death      as countries suddenly discover that their supplies of food      and medical services have been overwhelmed.    </p>    <p>      Even in an "optimistic" run, in which technological advance      enable man to expand his base of food and energy sources,      the computer still envisions calamity as pollution finally      does us all in.    </p>    <p>      In cool, calculated solemnity the Club of Rome report calls      for fundamental change in the values of society. Spelled      out politically, this means a deliberate, long-term policy      of anti-growth. The familiar phrase in the '60s, "Let's Get      America Moving Again," should become in the '70s, "Let's      Slow the World Down".    </p>    <p>      Nearly two hundred years ago economist Thomas Malthus      shocked his British readers much as the Club of Rome and      the editors of THE ECOLOGIST are shocking their readers      today. The first to apply the concept of growth on a global      scale, Malthus predicted mass starvation within decades as      the population increased geometrically while food supplies      expanded only arithmetically.    </p>    <p>      Malthus, of course, failed to take a few things into      account: the development of cheap transport among nations,      invention of the steam engine, the ability of      industrialized cities to absorb millions within their      confines, new agricultural techniques to increase a      farmer's yield. But Malthus' initial pessimism about man's      growth still looms over us. As his successors seem to      imply, he may have only missed the "overshoot" mark by a      few centuries.    </p>    <p>      In <em>WORLD DYNAMICS,</em> still another book that delves      into the future, Professor Jay Forrester echoes another of      Malthus' beliefs when he suggests that birth control might      only postpone the inevitable. As food supplies and living      standards stabilize along with the birth-death cycle,      Forrester reasons that masses of people would renew a basic      desire for more children . . . and the rate of population      increase would once again soar out of hand. This time for      keeps.    </p>    <p>      So far at least, this last suggestion does not conform with      recent events around the world. Birth rates in America,      Europe and Japan have not risen in the last decade despite      increases in the general availability of food and capital.      If anything, the Zero Population Growth idea seems to be      gaining in these countries.    </p>    <p>      But what of the other conclusions and their effect on the      important U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in      Stockholm next month?    </p>    <p>      "Garbage in, garbage out," replied one American working      with the U.N. advisory committee when asked what he thought      of the quality of the Club of Rome's computerized analysis.    </p>    <p>      Others were less cryptic. Delegates among developing      countries were outraged. They protested that the two      studies amounted to a manifesto for the superpowers to keep      the less advanced nations "down on the farm" while the      industrialized countries continue to enjoy the fruits of      technological progress.    </p>    <p>      But at least one officia-Tom Wilson, a consultant to      Conference Secretary-General Maurice Strong-said he      thought the net effect of the Club of Rome study would be      beneficial. "Those who dismiss out of hand the grim      predictions of many conservationists will have to take a      second look at the Club of Rome report. It's written in the      language of the computer. It's got numbers. It's something      the skeptics can understand.    </p>    <p>      "if nothing else," said Wilson, "the study is bound to      stimulate an interdisciplinary systems analysis of the      biosphere . . . a major goal of the U.N. conference."    </p>    <h3>AMCHITKA UPDATE</h3>    <p>      Many readers have pointed out that-in MOTHER NO.      13-I ignored a new Alaskan study which indicates that      as many as 1,100 sea otters may have died following the      nuclear test on Amchitka Island last November.    </p>    <p>      Our story, written before the Alaskan study became public      in early December, quoted the Atomic Energy Commission . .      . which at the time put the death count at 18 otters (the      official AEC total has since risen to 23).    </p>    <p>      Allan Frank, the reporter for the Anchorage Daily News who      broke the story about a possible large otter kill, told      MOTHER that Alaskan officials plan to conduct a census of      otters next month to verify the results of a survey taken      immediately after the blast.    </p>    <p>      According to Frank, three biologists spent a week last      November inspecting the otter population near the blast      site and found no more than 155 of the animals in an area      that had contained 1,200 sea otters last summer.    </p>    <p>      "The animals may have left naturally, but there's no      biological reason why things shouldn't be the same as      before the test," Jim Estes, an otter expert, told Frank.    </p>    <p>      Where could all the bodies have gone? Estes suggests that      the dead otters may have been blown out to sea by a severe      storm that followed the test or they may have sunk      permanently to the ocean floor due to pressure from the      blast.    </p>
