            		 <p><strong>BITS AND PIECES</strong></p>		      <p>      New news on ozone, wilderness, "super weeds" and other      matters.    </p>    <p><strong> OZONE</strong></p>        <p><strong>FORCAST</strong>    </p><p>IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THAT the air in most American      cities contains excessively high levels of ozone-the major      irritant in smog. But the results of a study conducted by      Harvard atmospheric scientist Jennifer Logan show that      rural air in the eastern U.S. can be laced with ozone      concentrations as high or higher than those reported in      urban regions. For two years, Logan collected daily ozone      readings from 18 rural monitoring stations. She found that      high-ozone periods lasting up to three days occurred-often      at the same time, or within a day or two of each other-at      sites hundreds of miles apart. The scientist also observed      that the outbreaks were associated with slowmoving      high-pressure weather systems that keep low-altitude      pollutants from dispersing into the upper atmosphere.      Airborne hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides then have an      opportunity to mix and generate ozone concentrations high      enough to cause (among other problems) poor crop yields.      There may well come a day, say some observers, when      meteorologists will include high-ozone warnings in their      forecasts, to give farmers enough time to apply chemical      protectants (now being developed) designed to shield plants      from ozone damage.    </p>    <h3>"Frankenweed"?</h3>    <p>      Genetic engineers are hard at work developing "super crops"      - corn that grows faster, beans that repel insects,      tomatoes that ripen on the vine and stay firm for shipping.      But they may also be creating monster weeds. Recent      research suggests that some commercial crops genetically      engineered to thrive amidst drought, disease, and      pestilence may be able to pass their super powers on to      close but undesirable relatives. Scientists have found that      plants distribute their pollen much more widely than      previously believed, and that when some plants receive      pollen from close kin, a gene exchange takes place. As a      result, the recipient plant may later produce hybrid      progeny. Some commercial crops (potatoes, for one) have no      domestic wild relatives, but others do - sorghum, for      instance, breeds with Johnsongrass, a notorious pest weed.      Ecologists caution that great care should be taken to      consider an individual crop plant's potential for gene      exchange before growing genetically altered strains in the      field.    </p>    <p>      <em>Too little up in the stratosphere,</em> <em>where we      need it, and too much down here, where we don't</em>    </p>    <h3>Energy Conservation Help</h3>    <p>      Nothing makes homeowners think <em>energy conservation</em>      faster than the arrival of the heating season's first fuel      bill. And there are few better places to get good advice on      reducing those bills than the Conservation and Renewable      Energy Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS). Among the      many helpful fact sheets CAREIRS offers for the asking are      "Insulation" (FS 142), which discusses the various types of      insulation and how to buy and install them, and "Home      Energy Audits" (FS 224), a guide to professional and      do-it-yourself analyses of home energy consumption and      conservation. Write or call CAREENS, P.O. Box 8900, Silver      Spring, MD 20907, 800/523-2929; or in Alaska or Hawaii,      800/233-3071.    </p>    <h3>Cow Curfew</h3>    <p>      It's 8:00 PM, and farmers in Vierlingsbeek, Holland, had      best know where their cows are. If the animals are out      grazing around on pasture instead of sequestered in the      barn between the hours of 8:00 PM and 6:00 Am, their owners      are subject to stiff fines. U.S. <em>Water News</em>      reports that local authorities in Vierlingsbeek imposed the      cow curfew as a part of regulations designed to protect      groundwater from nitrate pollution.    </p>    <h3>It's a (One-Third) Wild World</h3>    <p>      How much of planet earth remains truly wild, more or less      untouched by man's heavy hand? After carefully studying and      interpreting U.S. Defense aerial navigation charts,      environmental analyst J. Michael McCloskey and geographer      Heather Spalding have come up with an estimate:      approximately 18.56 million square miles, or about      one-third of the globe's landmass. Antarctica is the      largest single untouched region <em>(100%</em> wilderness),      followed by North America (37.5%), the Soviet Union      (33.6%), Australasia, which encompasses all islands of the      southwest Pacific (27.9%), Africa (27.5%), South America      (20.8%), Asia (13.6%), and Europe (2.8%). Most of the area      deemed wilderness in North America makes up a bandlike      tract stretching across northern Canada and Alaska.      Unfortunately, less than 20% of the pristine lands      identified in the global inventory are protected by law. In      addition, write the researchers in the journal Ambio, "at      least half of the remaining stock of wilderness is not      self-protecting by virtue of its forbidding nature. It can      slip away easily with little notice ... as billions more      are added to the human population." The study supports the      urgent efforts of many to dramatically increase the size      and number of protected wilderness areas. "The new      inventory shows it's still not too late," says McCloskey.    </p>    <h3>Eating Smart</h3>    <p>      For the past several years the Center for Science in the      Public Interest (CSPI) has published a series of helpful      posters providing useful facts about food. Among them are      "Chemical Cuisine" (which lists and describes common food      additives), "Fast Food Eating Guide" (an analysis of the      fat, sodium, sugar, and calorie content of more than 200      fast-food items), and "Life Saver Fat and Calorie Guide" (a      breakdown of several hundred common foods). Now, in      addition to the attractive 18" X 24" posters, CSPI is      offering the same information in compact, hand-held slide      charts; they are titled, respectively, "Eating Smart      Additive Guide," "Eating Smart Fast Food Guide," and      "Eating Smart Fat Guide." The posters and slide charts are      available for $3.95 each plus 75 cents handling per order      from CSPI-PD, 1501 16th St. NW, Washington, DC 20036-1499.    </p>    <p>      <em>COW CURFEW, PROTECTING WILDERNESS, COOKING CORN, ENERGY      MATTERS</em>    </p>    <h3>Energy-Efficient Careers</h3>    <p>      Rekindled interest in energy efficiency and environmental      awareness suggests meaningful futures for students of      Colorado Mountain College's Energy Efficient Building      Technology Program. The unusual one-year occupational      program takes a holistic approach to energy-efficient      building, incorporating a broad-based education in theory      and design with instruction in diverse practical      skills-such as blueprint reading, electrical wiring,      lighting and heating, photovoltaics, and energy auditing.      Intended for people who want a career in making buildings      more efficient or who want to learn about renewable      energies such as solar, the certification program claims an      impressive record: More than 75% of CMC graduates are      employed as consultants, builders, contractors, designers,      and researchers, and in other capacities in energy      efficiency-related industries. Further information on the      program is available from Colorado Mountain College, Energy      Efficient Building Technology Program, Box 10001, Glenwood      Springs, CO 81602; 303/945-7481.    </p>    <h3>Short People Rejoice</h3>    <p>      "Short stature is associated with reduced risk of cancer,      particularly in men," reads a report by researchers from      the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes      of Health. In a study of over 12,000 people divided into      four height categories, the shortest 25% had about 50% less      cancer over a 10-year period than the three taller groups.      The study suggests that height may be an especially      significant risk factor in colon cancer among men: The      tallest 25% were more than twice as likely to get colon      cancer as the shortest group.    </p>    <h3>Hole-y Corn, That's Good!</h3>    <p>      If you've ever eaten frozen corn on the cob, you may      already know that the corn can have an odd, cardboardlike      flavor if it has been in the freezer for more than a few      months. But C.Y. Lee, a Cornell University food scientist      studying the chemistry of enzymes blamed for bad taste in      frozen corn, has discovered a unique solution: drilling a      hole through the middle of the cob before blanching it. Lee      found that the taste-tainting enzymes, peroxidase and      lipoxygenase, are mostly on the outside of the cob and in      the bottom portion of the corn kernels. When corn on the      cob is prepared for freezing, it is blanched for several      minutes - but not long enough to deactivate the      offending enzymes, which therefore remain able to influence      the corn's flavor. Longer blanching times help, but also      make the corn unappetizingly soft. A hole drilled      lengthwise through the cob before blanching allows the corn      to be cooked quickly, from <em>both</em> sides of the      kernels, and the enzymes' flavor-wrecking abilities are      destroyed. Taste testers who compared drilled and undrilled      corn on the cob consistently preferred the bored variety.    </p>
