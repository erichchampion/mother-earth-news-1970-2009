            <p>      Issue # 120 - November/December 1989    </p>    <p>      <strong>PET CONCERNS</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Randy Kidd, D.V.M.    </h5>    <p>      <strong>IF DOGS AND CATS COULD TALK,</strong>I wonder what      they would say about the way we humans behave around      Christmastime. If you think we give each other a lot of      useless junk for the holidays, consider the silly trinkets      so often given to family pets! Before I suggest some      alternatives, though, I'd like to mention yet another      questionable pet-related holiday tradition.    </p>    <h3>      Giving Pets as Gifts    </h3>          <p>      I've always told my clients that there are two times      <em>not</em> to give a pet as a gift: 1) as a surprise and      2) for Christmas (or, for that matter, for any holiday; I      hate to think how many innocent chicks and ducklings are      given away for Easter).    </p>    <p>      It's always fun to surprise someone-but don't do it      with a living being. When you give someone an animal you're      also giving that person the responsibility for the      creature's life-for its care and keeping, 24 hours a day.      Unless you've talked to the "giftee," there's no way to      know whether that person is willing to assume the      responsibility. And if you're thinking about giving an      animal to a child, not only should you be certain that the      youngster is sufficiently mature to accept the      responsibility, but you should also be ready and willing to      help out and-if things don't turn out as      planned-to assume the role of primary caretaker.    </p>    <p>      <em>So please</em> no gift-giving surprises of living      creatures. It's a different matter entirely, of course, if      you've talked the idea over with everyone in the family,      and all have agreed to share the responsibility on a      continuing basis. But even then, I suggest waiting for a      less hectic season than Christmastime. The winter holidays      are unquestionably the worst time of year to introduce a      pet into your home life. There's a constant rush of      visitors in and out, the kids are home from school, there      is lots of food on the table, and all kinds of decorations      and wee heirlooms are on display that are not only      breakable but potentially dangerous and often toxic to      inquiring young animal mouths. Better to reconsider, and      opt for getting a pet when activities around the house are      at a more normal level-and when people have the time      to adequately assume the responsibilities involved in      caring for a new member of the family.    </p>    <h3>      Alternative Pet Gifts    </h3>    <p>      By all means, give your pet one frivolous gift to unwrap      and keep for itself-a rawhide bone for Spot, a catnip      toy for Calico. But I hope you'll consider, too, more      practical gifts that can help improve your pet's (and your)      quality of life.    </p>    <p>      For example, there's no better gift for a dog, in my      opinion, than a training program that teaches proper social      behavior. In today's world pets <em>must</em> be well      mannered, for their own health and safety and for the sake      of the people (and other pets) around them.    </p>    <p>      At the very least, Bowser needs to learn to respond      properly to "sit," "stay," "come," and "heel"-and he      needs to know how to do these <em>on command,</em> no      matter what the distraction. These are the basic behavior      lessons; you can teach him tricks later, such as fetch,      shake hands, play dead, and roll over.    </p>    <p>      Many communities sponsor obedience classes that are      inexpensive, if not free-check with your town's parks and      recreation department or a local kennel club or pet store.      Or ask your veterinarian.    </p>    <p>      Or, you be the teacher. There are any number of fine books      that'll show you how to instruct Pooch in the basics of      good behavior. Browse through the pet section at a      bookstore, or peruse the 636s and 639s at the library.    </p>    <p>      And that brings me to my next gift suggestion: Give your      pet a more capable, more understanding, more involved owner      by educating yourself about animals and their care. There      are literally stacks of informative books on pets. You can      learn about specific breeds of dogs or cats, about the      proper care and keeping of reptiles or rodents or birds,      about pet exercise and animal psychology. If you like to      cook, you might be interested in one of the many pet-food      cookbooks on the market. There are even books on animal      astrology for those who are interested in that field. The      selection is virtually unlimited.    </p>    <h3>      To help you choose, here are some of my favorites:    </h3>    <p>      <em>How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend: A Training Manual for      Dog Owners,</em> <em><br />      by the monks of New Skete.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Invisible Leash: A Better Way to Communicate With      Your Dog,<br /></em> <em>by Myrna M. Milani, D.V.M.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Good Dog, Bad Dog,</em> <em><br />      by Mordecai Siegal and Matthew Margolis.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>When Good Dogs Do Bad Things,</em> <em><br />      by Mordecai Siegal and Matthew Margolis.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>No Bad Dogs: Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way,</em>      <em><br />      by Barbara Woodhouse.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pet Aerobics: How to Solve Your Pets' Behavior      Problems, Improve Their Health, Lengthen Their Lives and      Have Fun Doing It,</em><br />      <em>by Warren Eckstein and Fay Eckstein.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>How to Have A Healthier Dog. The Benefits</em> <em>of      Vitamins and Minerals for Your Dog's Life Cycles,</em> by      Wendel O. Belfield, D.V.M., and Martin Zucker.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dr. Pitcairn's Complete Guide to Natural Health for      Dogs and Cats,</em> by Richard H. Pitcairn, D.V.M., and      Susan H. Pitcairn. <em>Choosing the Right Dog,</em>      <em><br />      by John Howe.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Four-Footed Therapist: How Your Pet Can Help You      Solve Your Problems,</em> <em><br />      by Dr. Janet Ruckert.</em>    </p>    <h3>      A Final Suggestion    </h3>    <p>      Another way to celebrate the holidays and the joy your pet      gives you is to make a donation to any of the fine      organizations around the country working to bring pets and      people together. Most communities have a local chapter of      the Humane Society, the staff of which is almost always      underfunded and overworked; they are sure to appreciate      your help.    </p>    <p>      There are so many other pet-related organizations around      that I can't possibly list them all. One, though, that I      think deserves special mention is the Delta Society, a      nonprofit group involved in studying, and putting to work,      the positive effects of the human-animal bond on the mental      and physical well-being of people. Delta's members' include      medical professionals, animal trainers and breeders, pet      owners, psychologists, teachers, gerontologists, and others      who simply share a love for animals. Among other      activities, the organization provides training and support      to help people set up programs that utilize animals in      therapy-in places like hospitals, nursing homes,      rehabilitation centers, and schools for autistic children.      Delta is also involved in such projects as training      assistance dogs for deaf people ("hearing-ear dogs") and      for individuals who are wheelchair-bound. The work is      producing extraordinary results and is well worth your      support. Donations are tax-deductible; you can write or      call the Delta Society (212 Wells Ave. S., Suite C, Renton,      WA 98055; 206/226-7357) for further information on its      programs and on becoming a member.    </p>    <p>      And finally, of course, don't let the busy holiday season      make you forget that the simplest and most meaningful gift      you can give any pet is genuine love and caring, every day,      every season. Happy holidays to you, your family,      <em>and</em> your pets!    </p>
