                    <p>      <strong>CHRISTMAS MERINGUES</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>A procrostinator's guide to largely low-fat      cookies</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      LOOK, WE BOTH know how it will turn out. We'll postpone the      shopping, delay the wrapping, defer the Christmas cards,      and stall the relatives who want to visit. Then, when the      roast turkeys come home to roost, when we're trying to      finish every last-minute thing we wish we had started two      months earlier, we'll announce firmly, "No Christmas      cookies this year. There just isn't time." And add      virtuously, "Who needs all that extra fat anyway, all that      butter, shortening, and oil?"    </p>    <p>      Instantly, friends and neighbors will appear at the door      with festive tins of handsome, home-baked goods. And we'll      feel lazy, meanspirited, left out. We'll decide that maybe      we will do some baking, even if it is late, even if we are      dreaming of a light Christmas.    </p>    <p>      A good time to make meringues. These sweet, airy      confections-crisp, firm cookies, not the soft, moist      topping for pies-require about 10 minutes of      preparation time and a few staples found in any      half-stocked kitchen: egg whites, sugar, salt, and      flavoring. Depending on what additional ingredients are      added, meringues range from fat-free to reasonably low in      that least welcome nutrient. Served alone or with fresh      fruit or sherbet, they're a welcome addition to a light      meal or a perfect ending to a heavy one.    </p>    <p>      Essentially, meringues are sweetened egg whites that are      beaten and baked. All the bad press that eggs are getting      these days belongs primarily to the yolks; the whites are      blameless. Sixty of a large egg's 80 calories are in the      yolk, along with all the cholesterol and virtually all the      fat. (If an egg is contaminated with salmonella, that's in      the yolk too.) The white contains a measly 17 calories, 16      of them from protein of such high quality that it is the      standard against which other proteins, animal or vegetable,      are commonly measured.    </p>    <p>      Aside from beating the egg whites with sugar and baking      them in a low oven until they're dry and firm, there's not      much to making meringues. A few fine      <strong>points:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Egg whites whip up to a larger volume when they're at room      temperature. If there's time, get them out of the      refrigerator beforehand to warm up. Meringues don't change      shape in the oven; what goes in is what comes out. If there      are any misshapen forms or weird little protuberances,      round them off with a spoon before baking. All the recipes      except Lemon Meringues call for 1/8 teaspoon of cream of      tartar, which lurks somewhere in most kitchens. If you're      out, you can substitute another acid-1/2 teaspoon of      lemon juice or white vinegar for every two egg whites.      Meringues should be stored in an airtight container to      prevent them from becoming sticky-which will happen      especially fast on humid days.    </p>    <p>      We don't want to overstate the nutritional purity of our      seven recipes. While our basic meringues are fat-free and      have less than a teaspoon of sugar each, some of the      ingredients in the other recipes up the ante. Chocolate      chips, coconut, and almonds, alas, all add fat. (They were,      of course, among our taste testers' favorites.) Still,      we've kept the amounts of the offending ingredients small,      and compared with the butter-rich fudge and      shortening-based piecrusts that abound during the holidays,      even dolled-up meringues are easy on the waistline.    </p>    <h3>Basic Meringues</h3>    <p>      2 egg whites<br />      1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />      Pinch of salt<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla extract    </p>    <p>      Lightly oil a baking sheet, and line with waxed paper.      (Don't oil the paper.)    </p>    <p>      Beat egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add cream of      tartar, and beat on high until whites hold stiff peaks.      Gradually beat in sugar, keeping mixer on high and      sprinkling the sugar over the whites a tablespoon at a      time. Add salt and vanilla extract, and beat on high until      mixture is smooth and glossy and holds soft peaks.    </p>    <p>      Drop by teaspoonfuls onto baking sheet, rounding off any      that are shaped unattractively. Bake in a preheated      250°F oven 1 hour, or until meringues are firm. Let      cool on baking sheet a minute or two, or until they lift      off easily; place on rack to cool. Makes about 30-35.    </p>    <h3>Lemon Meringues</h3>    <p>      1 lemon<br />      2 egg whites<br />      1/2 teaspoon lemon juice<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />      Pinch of salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon lemon extract<br />      Few drops of yellow food coloring (optional)    </p>    <p>      With a lemon zester, remove peel from a clean lemon in      short, thin strips; or grate peel, being careful not to      include any of the bitter white pith. Set aside.    </p>    <p>      Beat egg whites on medium until foamy; add lemon juice, and      beat on high until whites hold stiff peaks. Gradually beat      in sugar. Add salt, lemon extract, and, if desired, a few      drops of yellow food coloring-enough to tint the      mixture pale yellow. Beat on high until mixture holds soft      peaks. With a rubber spatula, gently fold in the lemon      zest. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto baking sheet lined with      waxed paper, and bake in a preheated 250°F oven for 1      hour. Cool on the baking sheet for a minute or two, until      meringues come off paper easily; place on rack to cool.      Makes 30-35.    </p>    <h3>Peppermint Meringues</h3>    <p>      2 ounces peppermint-stick candy<br />      2 egg whites<br />      1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar<br />      1/3 cup sugar<br />      1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />      Pinch of salt    </p>    <p>      In a food processor or blender, process candy until chopped      medium fine. Reserve 30 of the larger chunks that remain,      and set the rest aside.    </p>    <p>      Beat egg whites on medium speed until foamy; add cream of      tartar, and beat on high until whites hold stiff peaks.      Gradually beat in sugar. Add vanilla and salt, and beat      until mixture is smooth and glossy and holds soft peaks.      Fold in chopped candy. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto baking      sheet lined with waxed paper, and place a piece of candy on      top of each meringue. Bake in preheated 250°F oven for      1 hour. Cool on baking sheet for a minute or two, then      remove to rack to cool. Makes 30-35.    </p>    <h3>Fruit Meringues</h3>    <p>      2 egg whites<br />      1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar<br />      1/2 cup sugar Pinch of salt<br />      1/2 teaspoon brandy, rum, or vanilla extract<br />      1/3 cup chopped, mixed, candied fruit<br />      Candied fruit for decoration    </p>    <p>      Beat egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add cream of      tartar, and beat on high until whites hold stiff peaks.      Gradually beat in sugar, add salt and extract, and beat      until mixture holds soft peaks. Fold in fruit.    </p>    <p>      Drop by teaspoonfuls onto baking sheet lined with waxed      paper, and place a piece of candied fruit atop each      meringue. Bake in preheated 250°F oven for 1 hour. Cool      on baking sheet for a minute or two, then remove to rack to      cool. Makes 30-35.    </p>    <h3>Chocolate Chip Meringues</h3>    <p>      2 egg whites<br />      1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />      Pinch of salt<br />      1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />      1/3 cup mini chocolate chips    </p>    <p>      Beat egg whites on medium speed until foamy; add cream of      tartar, and beat on high until whites hold stiff peaks.      Gradually beat in sugar. Add salt and vanilla, and beat      until mixture holds soft peaks. With rubber spatula, gently      fold in mini chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls on      baking sheet lined with waxed paper, and bake in a      preheated 250°F oven for 1 hour. Cool on baking sheet      for a minute or two, then remove to rack to cool. Makes      30-35.    </p>    <h3>Coconut Meringues</h3>    <p>      2 egg whites<br />      1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />      Pinch of salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon coconut extract<br />      1/4 cup shredded coconut    </p>    <p>      Beat egg whites on medium until foamy; add cream of tartar,      and beat on high until they hold stiff peaks. Beat in sugar      gradually. Add salt and coconut extract, and beat on high      until mixture holds soft peaks. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto      baking sheet lined with waxed paper, and top each meringue      with shredded coconut. Bake in a preheated 250 F oven for I      hour. Cool on baking sheet for a minute or two, then      transfer to rack to cool. Makes 30-35.    </p>    <p>      Note: Coconut is easier to sprinkle evenly and lightly if      it dries in a pan for a couple of minutes in the preheating      oven.    </p>    <h3>Almond Meringues</h3>    <p>      1/4 cup sliced almonds<br />      2 egg whites<br />      1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />      Pinch of salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon almond extract    </p>    <p>      Place the almonds on a cookie sheet, and toast them in a      350°F oven 4-5 minutes. Process in a food processor or      blender until finely ground.    </p>    <p>      Beat egg whites on medium speed until frothy; add cream of      tartar, and beat on high until stiff peaks form. Gradually      beat in the sugar. Add salt and almond extract, and beat on      high until mixture is smooth, glossy and forms soft peaks.      With a rubber spatula, gently fold in the ground almonds.      Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the cookie sheet. Bake in a      preheated 250°F oven for 1 hour. Cool on baking sheet,      then remove to rack to cool thoroughly. Makes 30-35.    </p>
