                    <p>      <strong>A SMOKE DETECTOR CAN PROVIDE VITAL EARLY WARNING TO      PROTECT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ...</strong>the perils of a      home conflagration<br />    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by David Schoonmaker    </h5>            <p>      EACH YEAR, BETWEEN 5,000 and 6,000 people in the U S. die      as a result of structural fires, ranking it fourth as a      cause of accidental death. Only car accidents, falls, and      drowning claim more lives. Of these fatalities, more than      80% occur in one- and two-family homes.    </p>    <p>      Happy, there are significant fewer fire deaths today than      there were 10 years ago-this despite more than a      doubling in property losses owing to fire during the same      period. There's a simple explanation for the declining      number of deaths in the face of increasing dollar losses.      It's called the smoke detector.    </p>    <h3>      The Hardware    </h3>    <p>      There are two basic types of smoke detectors. An ionization      unit contains a small amount (less than one microcurie) of      a radio-active substance, such as americium-241. The      decaying material fills one or two sampling chambers with      ions of nitrogen and oxygen, which support a very small      electrical current that keeps the alarm silent. Should      smoke enter the chamber(s), however, the ions attach to the      particles, and the current path breaks down, sounding the      alarm.    </p>    <p>      Photoelectric smoke alarms rely on light scattering to      detect smoke. As long as light emitted periodically by a      diode (LED) fails to strike a photocell set out of line of      the light path, the alarm stays off. But if smoke enters      the light-tight chamber, the particles will reflect and      refract the light onto the photocell, sounding the alarm.    </p>    <p>      Each type has its advantages. Because it depends on an      ion-strewn current path, the ionization detector responds      better to smoke consisting of numerous small (less than one      micron) particles-typical of the emissions from a      blazing fire. It will, for example, respond quickly to      toxic gases given off by certain burning plastics.      Unfortunately, it's also quite sensitive to the fumes      produced in a busy kitchen. A photoelectric detector      responds more quickly to the large (greater than one      micron) particles produced by smoldering fires. It will      warn earlier of the sort of fire caused by a careless      smoker or by spontaneous combustion, And it's much less      prone to sound nuisance alarms. Its main failing is a      comparative insensitivity to fumes and to black particles,      which absorb rather than reflect light.    </p>    <p>      If you had to pick between the two, the photoelectric      detector would probably be the better first choice.      According to the National Fire Protection Association,      nearly all house fires give off dense smoke before bursting      into flames or creating toxic fumes. In some instances, the      lag time between smoke and a hazardous atmosphere may be as      little as one minute, so early warning is vital.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, you don't have to choose between the      technologies. Several companies produce alarms that use      both sampling methods, and the combination is considerably      more effective than either alone. Some companies even offer      ionization or photoelectric detectors equipped with heat      sensors. Except in special circumstances, though, this is      probably an unnecessary option. For the homeowner, the      ionizationphotoelectric combination gives the earliest      warning, since smoke and fumes )recede any significant rise      in temperature.    </p>    <p>      New homes are now equipped with hardwired (12VDC or      120VAC), interconnected smoke detectors as a matter of      course, but the 9VDC battery type is still widely used in      existing homes. Either can be effective, but the wired      units do have advantages. First, they don't require annual      battery replacement. But equally important is their easy      interconnection. While they're being wired, the units can      all be set to sound when one detector senses smoke. Thus      people sleeping in one part of the house will be sure to be      aware of a fire in a remote area. It is possible to      interconnect battery-type alarms, but stringing wire      defeats their main advantage: simple installation. Of      course, hard-wired detectors are dependent on the house's      electrical system, while batterypowered alarms will sound      even during a power outage. If you're building in an area      prone to power loss, you might consider a hard-wired system      with battery backup. (Note: When replacing the 9VDC cell in      a battery-powered detector, always use the item specified      by the manufacturer. The weakbattery warning alarms in      these units are designed for a particular battery's      characteristics, and substituting a different type may      corrupt the system.)    </p>    <p>      Many other features are available to the discerning      smoke-detector shopper. One particularly valuable option is      a light (flashing or continuous) that indicates that the      detector is operating normally. All smoke alarms have      manual test circuits, but a quick glance is much easier      than reaching up to push a button. When you're shopping,      it's also worth checking the sound level of the alarm. The      minimum is 85 decibels, but some detectors sound at as high      as 95 decibels, which might be useful in a basement but      would be unwelcome in your living room. Other models offer      lights to help you find your way out of the building, and      even computersynthesized voices giving exit instructions.    </p>    <h3>      Where Should They Be?    </h3>    <p>      Though every new smoke detector includes detailed placement      instructions, an understanding of the principles of fire      detection can help you tailor those guidelines to your      home.    </p>    <p>      About 70% of all residential fire fatalities occur between      8:00 PM and 8:00 AM, so the main danger from fire is that      sleeping people will be overcome by smoke or toxic fumes.      For that reason, smoke detectors should be placed 1) in the      path smoke would take to reach the bedrooms from the rest      of the house and 2) in locations close enough to the      bedrooms to rouse everyone. Thus, depending on your home's      layout, you may need from one to several detectors.    </p>    <p>      For example, a single detector located on the ceiling      outside the bedroom doors might adequately protect a      single-story house with all the bedrooms in one wing. On      the other hand, if the master bedroom is isolated from the      other bedrooms, there should be an additional detector      outside that door. Twostory houses should have a detector      on each floor. One should be installed outside the bedrooms      on the second floor, and another should be located near the      stairwell on the first floor. If there is a basement, it      would also be a good idea to place one near the stairway      that leads up to the first floor. It isn't necessary to      have a detector at each level of a split-level house unless      doors separate the areas. All detectors wired to household      current-and battery-operated detectors, if      possible-should be interconnected so they all sound when      one senses smoke.    </p>    <p>      Additional detectors-perhaps in the bedrooms if doors      are kept closed, or in the living room-would increase      the safety margin slightly. In general, though, avoid      putting detectors in the kitchen, in the garage, or near a      fireplace or woodstove, since false alarms are likely in      these places.    </p>    <p>      As for the specifics of installation, because smoke rises,      detectors usually work best when attached to the ceiling.      However, if the ceiling is uninsulated or radiantly heated,      place them on the wall between 4" and 12" from the ceiling.      Further, if the ceiling has exposed joists or beams, place      the detector on the bottom of one. On a ceiling with a      slope greater than 1:8, the detector should be set within      4" and 12" vertically and 4" and 36" laterally of the      highest point. Detectors should never be installed within      4" of a wall-ceiling junction or a corner, either of which      smoke may bypass. Likewise, don't position detectors in the      air path of heating or air-conditioning vents.    </p>    <h3>      Evacuation Plan    </h3>    <p>      Though installing a smoke detector is the first step toward      fire safety in your home, knowing what to do when the alarm      goes off is as important. You should have an evacuation      plan, and everyone in the household should understand and      practice it. Though fire drills may seem a little silly at      the time, practice is important because of the      circumstances in which fire danger is likely to arise. When      a smoke alarm awakens a sleeping family in the middle of      the night, few are likely to be clearheaded. Groggy,      frightened people are safest following a standard routine.      Fire drills are particularly important for small children      and the elderly, who are more than twice as likely to die      in a residential fire as those between 10 and 60.    </p>    <p>      Everyone should understand that the most important action      in the event of a fire is to get out of the house as      quickly and safely as possible. There is no time to get      dressed, collect pets or personal possessions, or even call      the fire department.    </p>    <p>      Plan two exits from every room. For secondstory bedrooms,      that may mean installing a ladder at a window. There are      commercial rope and chain models, and a reader's design is      featured. The first-choice exit through the house is the      normal one, but check it before proceeding. Before opening      a door to a hall, look for smoke coming under it, and place      a hand against it to check for warmth. If either test is      positive, use the window exit instead.    </p>    <p>      Since smoke rises, practice crawling to avoid it. Because      electricity is likely to fail during a fire, you should      also learn to find your way out without the aid of lights.      It might even be wise to try the route blindfolded. If at      all possible, people leaving the house should close doors      behind them to slow the fire's progress. Everyone should      also know to drop to the floor and roll back and forth to      extinguish fire on clothing.    </p>    <p>      Once safely outside, all should gather at a predetermined      meeting place, so you can quickly assess whether everyone      has gotten out. All too often, people die when they go back      into a burning building to save someone who has actually      escaped and is standing somewhere out of sight.    </p>    <h3>      Fire Extinguishers    </h3>    <p>      Though most life-threatening fires occur when people are      sleeping, a fire extinguisher may still save lives and can      certainly reduce damage. Look for one with at least five      pounds, and preferably 10 pounds, capacity, with an A-B-C      rating. Keep it in a central location near the kitchen (for      cooking-related problems) and the living room, if there is      a fireplace or woodstove. It's also a good idea to keep      another in the garage.    </p>    <p>      Anyone who may use a fire extinguisher should read the      instructions carefully and commit them to memory. Technique      is very important in getting the most from an extinguisher,      and the approach varies depending on the type of fire.    </p>    <p>      One final precaution should probably go without saying:      Don't smoke in bed. Better yet, don't smoke at all. About      32% of all residential fire-related deaths occur as a      result of improperly extinguished cigarettes-about 15% in      beds and 17% in upholstered furniture in the living area.    </p>    <p>      Of course, even a careless smoker might be saved by a smoke      detector. There's simply - no excuse for not having one.    </p>    <h3>      BUILD A BETTER FIRE ESCAPE    </h3>    <p>      <strong>READER DAVID L. CONOVER WRITES,</strong>"Several      years ago, when my children were small, I, like so many      young parents, worried constantly about fire in my house. I      wanted a fire escape system that anyone, young or old,      could use-one that a neighbor or passerby could also      activate but that wouldn't be too attractive to burglars.      The system I came up with has worked admirably in all types      of weather since I built it in 1979-often being used      by one son for escape from parental confinement in his      room-and it has added considerably to our sense of      security."    </p>        <p class="caption">      <strong>Collapsed, the fire escape is smaller than a      downspout.</strong><br />      <strong>Extended by pivoting from the wall, it forms a      stable ladder.</strong><br />      <strong>Side braces prevent the ladder from swinging side      to side.</strong>    </p>    <p>      We think you'll agree that this is a really ingenious      approach to a fire escape-one which is much better      than a dangling rope or a chain ladder. It folds to the      wall and is inconspicuous when not in use, and is very      stable and easy to reach when deployed. It could be pinned      at the top to prevent anyone from gaining access from      below, or it could be lightly sprung so it could be opened      from either end.    </p>    <p>      David's design employed simple interlocking sections Of 1      1/2 " (for the rails) and 1" (for the steps) straight-gauge      U-channel steel. However, when we looked for these      materials at our local steel supply, we found that only the      tapered wall U-channel was common to our shop's shelves. If      you can find the straight-gauge U-channel in your area,      this is certainly the simplest and strongest approach. As      an alternative, though, MOTHER's own Dennis Burkholder      offers the combination of readily available parts pictured      here.    </p>        <h3>      THE "I" WORD    </h3>    <p>      <strong>IONIZING SMOKE DETECTORS</strong>Contain a small      amount of radioactive material which may, under certain      circumstances, pose a health hazard. Theories on the      effects of low levels of radiation tend to be very      controversial. Extremes of scientific opinion include the      notion that low-level radiation may be beneficial as well      as the conviction that its effects are grossly      underestimated. Faced with such a lack of consensus, it's      probably safest to be cautious.    </p>    <p>      Almost every expert would agree that you are safer with an      ionizing smoke detector than with no detector at all. And      most would contend that it's worth having an ionizing      detector even if you also have a photoelectric model. The      risk from fire is simply far greater than that posed by      radiation from a smoke detector. In fact, there is probably      next to no risk to a homeowner unless the foil packaging      around the radioactive isotope is broken. Nonetheless, you      should handle an ionizing detector carefully and dispose of      it only by shipping it back to its manufacturer. Never take      an ionizing detector apart, and don't keep it in the house      if it is damaged. Use it with good sense and in good      health.    </p>
