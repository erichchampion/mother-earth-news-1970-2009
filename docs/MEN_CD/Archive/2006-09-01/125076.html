        Bicycle panniers, or baskets, allow you to use your bike to makeshort trips in town to the grocery store, library, video store orother nearby shops. For practical, lightweight and low-costpanniers, try using small, rectangular plastic wastebaskets.<br /><br />Just drill quarter-inch holes under the rim along one side of thebaskets, and a few more in the bottom for drainage in wet weather.Then use nylon rope to tie the bicycle baskets to the rear rack.The baskets may rattle a bit when you hit a bump in the road, butthey can tilt up to be emptied of leaves and other debris. To carrya dozen library books or a couple days' worth of groceries, use16-quart bins, which are just the right size.<br /><br /><br />
