        <p>If you run out of homemade jellies and jams before the next fruit harvest, there’s a simple and inexpensive solution for making jelly: You can make homemade jelly from fruit juice instead of the fruit itself.</p><p>Simply buy a can of frozen juice concentrate, and use that in place of fresh juice. The most common choice for this would be grape juice, but you could also use apple, raspberry or any other flavor that strikes your fancy. As long as the ingredients are only fruit juice, purée and water, it will be good for making jelly. Two full cans of juice will give you approximately a triple batch of jelly, depending on the recipe, for a price similar to one or two jars at the grocery store.</p><p>The cost savings on this homemade jelly is not huge, but for me, having more control over the ingredients (possibly reducing the sugar, preservatives, etc.) is worth the time it takes to make it.</p><h5>Chris Clark<br />McKinney, Texas</h5>
