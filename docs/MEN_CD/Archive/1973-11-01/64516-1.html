        TOP LEFT TO RIGHT. Water streams over the Fitz Wheel as access flow from the ""race"" is diverted by the sluice gate. The water outlet is positioned six inches above the wheel so that logs and other debris shoot out over the buckets, preventing damage. BOTTOM RIGHT. Oates uses a series of nine drive pulleys connected by canvas belts to transfer the power from the water wheel to the generator and woodworking equipment. This setup enables our mountaineer craftsman to produce enough electricity to run more than 50 light bulbs.
