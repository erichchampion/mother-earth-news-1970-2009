        <p>On November 2, 1973 a press conference was held on the Shuttleworth farm in Indiana. Representatives of <em>Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, Farm Journal, Prairie Farmer, Rolling Stone, Earth News,</em> the Associated Press, the Bureau of Mines, the United Auto Workers, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and many local TV stations and newspapers rubbed shoulders with a number of Hoosier farmers who had come to see whether or not "Shuttleworth's Folly" would work.</p><p>It did. Everyone was treated to an explanation of the digester's operation and was shown that t "homemade fuel" it produced would cook food on a gas stove, power both natural gas and propane lamps, run a gas refrigerator and furnace and water heal. . . and drive a 1948 Chevrolet automobile engine L. John Fry-of South African pig farm fame-was also on hand to demonstrate a model bio-gas plant and tell how he had powered his whole 1,000-hog agricultural operation on methane made from the pigs' droppings. <strong>MORE Â»</strong></p>
