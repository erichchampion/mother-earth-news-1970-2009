                		<hr />    <p>      <strong>Your David Brower interview (MOTHER NO. 21, pg.      6-12) reminded me how terrific that guy is. I was lucky      enough to be at the alternate energy conference in Cape      May, New Jersey, where the interview was conducted. Brower      is the one who made the day for most of us there...not      overlooking the genius of Buckminster Fuller. The debate      between Brower and U.S. Senator Mike Gravel over the      Alaskan pipeline was won hands down by Brower. Senator      Gravel is the leader of anti-nuclear energy thought in      Congress, but he's lost a lot of his admirers through his      pro-pipeline stand.</strong>    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's readers should follow Brower's advice about      involvement. It <em>did work</em> on the SST. The Earth is      too beautiful a place to give up trying to save it. Brower      is an inspiration for those, such as myself, who are      directly involved in saving it by profession. (I am      currently County Planning Director of St. Lawrence County,      New York, and formerly held the same position in Cape May,      New Jersey.) Follow this man...he offers many answers that      are unquestionable, and many more questions that are      unanswerable.<br />      <br />      The conference itself, and the Sun People who staged it,      may be worth some additional coverage by      MOTHER...especially a gal named Ruth Fisher, organizer of      the Sun People and a hell of a lot of woman. She combines a      wealth of alternate-living ideas into her own unique      lifestyle and a dedication to changing other people's views      into environmentally sane ones through a diversity of      eco-tactics...such as the energy conference.<br />      <br />      <strong>Richard Grover<br />      Winthrop, New York</strong><br />      <br />      <em>Mr. Morneau's following comments cover both "The      Plowboy Interview" with David Brower and his Friends of the      Earth Foundation advertisement on pg. 108-109 of the same      issue. - MOTHER.</em><br />      <br />      David Brower's warning about the dangers of nuclear      reactors was interesting, but grossly exaggerated. The      interview depressed me because people who are unfamiliar      with nuclear energy can easily be prejudiced against this      power source simply because they do not know all the facts      or because they've been given false information.<br />      <br />      I would like to counter a few points made by Mr. Brower. I      mention now that what I say does not include everything      that could be said about the situation. I will only speak      of those things that I feel most competent to speak      about.<br />      <br />      Mr. Brower says, "Man-made nuclear reactors are not so well      engineered as the sun, and none has been so thoroughly      tested." This statement is ridiculous. First of all, the      sun produces its energy through nuclear fusion...a much      more energetic means than the nuclear fission used in      nuclear power reactors. Nuclear fusion and nuclear fission      are completely different means of producing energy.      Secondly, many billions of dollars have been spent in the      study and development of nuclear power engineering. To      speak of the sun as being more "thoroughly tested" is      equally ridiculous, unless he is including sunbathing as      some form of scientific test.<br />      <br />      The <em>Brookhaven</em> <em>Report</em> , "Theoretical      Possibilities and Consequences of Major Accidents in Large      Nuclear Power Plants", was published in 1957. In the 16      years since then, the Atomic Energy Commission's safety      requirements have become much more stringent.<br />      <br />      Mr. Brower claims that <em>if</em> the maximum credible      accident actually occurred <em>and</em> the emergency core      cooling system failed, the radiation released to exposed      populations could be lethal up to 100 miles away. First of      all, we must assume that the accident will occur...an      extremely unlikely event Secondly, we must assume that the      emergency cooling system fails...an even more unlikely      event. When the AEC appraises the effectiveness of a      particular safety system, they always assume that the      system can fail. Therefore, they require that additional      safety systems be built, so, if the first system fails, the      other systems will be able to handle the emergency      completely on their own. This is true of the emergency core      cooling system, which is not just one system, but - usually      - three...each capable of effectively cooling the core by      itself. The probability of all three systems failing      simultaneously is extremely low.<br />      <br />      Mr. Brower mentioned several other points, all of which - I      think - are exaggerated to the point of foolishness. I      suggest that Mr. Brower (and anyone else interested) write      to the AEC or any nuclear plant and ask them how these      "accidents" are prevented. I have no doubt that the      explanations given will destroy anyone's fears on the      dangers of nuclear power production.<br />      <br />      Finally, nuclear physicists, nuclear engineers and      radiation health physicists, after having thoroughly      studied nuclear engineering and radiation, continue to work      40 hours each week in what Mr. Brower would consider      extremely dangerous situations. If anyone understands the      hazards involved in these fields, I'm sure it's these men      and women. Yet they continue on their jobs in complete      safety. When I fly on a commercial jetliner, I trust the      pilot in his ability to get me to my destination safety. I      assume he knows more about flying than I do. I can only      hope that Mr. Brower and people with similar viewpoints      will realize their mistake in not trusting people who are      certainly much more knowledgeable on the subject.<br />      <br />      <strong>Richard A. Morneau<br /></strong> <strong>Lawrence,      Mass.</strong><br />      <br />      <em>Richard, we've run your letter...but we most certainly      cannot endorse it in any way. We do have some firsthand      knowledge of people who are now dying of cancer directly      caused by their work in some of those "safe" labs you hold      up as such a shining example for us all. As a matter of      fact, we've been told that one of these individuals was all      set to tell his story to the world when the AEC informed      him that-if he did so - it would take some rather cruel      action that we won't specify here. I only hope to God the      story isn't true.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Sorry, but I have to disagree with you on all your      other points too. If anything, Id say that Dave Brower (and      remember, he started out loving nuclear energy before he      had carefully examined both the good and bad that it      offers) has understated the real and potential dangers of      both fission and fusion. The "experts" who continue to      shove this power source down our throats simply scare the      hell out of me. - JS.</em><br />      <br />      I must agree with Dave Brower - even though I'm an      electrical engineer (or, as I refer to myself, a renegade      engineer) - that nuclear power at present is impractical.      The Price - Anderson Act absolves the companies of economic      responsibility for accidents. I seriously doubt that - with      all economic pressures giving nuclear power advocates a      strong incentive to cut corners in order for their plants      to become financially competitive with conventional power      generation - we're going to see much care put into accident      prevention. Right now, no atomic power plant that I've      heard of has delivered up to expectations. Maintenance in      an area where no man can go is slow and costly.<br />      <br />      Fusion could be the answer, but I do have reservations      there, too. My personal hunch is that nothing will solve      our problems without a radical change in our society. I'm      not overly optimistic.</p><p>      <strong>Rick Brooks<br />      Fremont, Ind.</strong>    </p>
