            		<hr />    		<hr />    <p>      <strong>CORPORATIONS AND CHILD CARE</strong> , a 48-page      report on how capital profits from day care, is available      from the American Friends Service Committee, 48 Inman      Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139. The booklet      describes how big business makes money from both the      high-priced sale of low-quality service and the use of      cheap female labor. There also is a chapter on alternatives      which includes a list of resources on parent- and      teacher-controlled community centers, and materials for use      in nonracist, non-sexist pre-schools. Cost: 50  cents to      individuals; $1.00 to libraries and institutions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE NEWSPAPER YOU READ TODAY MAY BE YOUR FOOD      TOMORROW</strong> , according to a Denver University      microbiologist. Dr. Brooks D. Church says that fungi can      turn discarded paper into a protein-rich food supplement      ... and the mold produced contains as much as 50 percent      protein. Currently it's used in animal feed, and - if      approved by federal health agencies--could supplement human      food, Dr. Church says. Fungus has been grown successfully      on the leftovers from paper factories, grain mills and      breweries...and even on feed lot cattle wastes and manure.      The Green Giant Company's Minnesota corn and pea cannery      and an Iowa milling firm are now testing the idea in pilot      plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF LAND</strong> , the United      States' most basic resource, is gathering momentum from      Washington officials. Congress, backed by the Nixon      administration, is trying to establish measures that could      affect millions of people... what they can do with their      property, where to build or buy new homes, and even where      you can spend your vacation.    </p>    <p>      There is still an estimated 10 acres for everyone in the      country, but the postwar "baby boom" is causing the      formation of 27,000 new households each week and, in the      next two decades, power plants and transmission lines alone      will take up over 5,000 square miles. Because of this      growth pattern, Hawaii has zoned every foot of its      territory, earmarking sections for urban, rural,      agricultural or conservation uses... California requires      special permits for coastal construction, while Maine,      Vermont, Florida, Washington and Oregon are trying to pass      laws to control a stampede of land speculators.    </p>    <p>      The Land Use Policy Act (S. 268), introduced for a second      time by Sen. Henry Jackson, D.-Wash., passed the Senate 64      to 21, but awaits reconciliation with differing House      proposals. If approved, participating states would share      100 million dollars to set up authorities to inventory land      and resources, regulate sales and developments, control      environmentally sensitive areas, influence locations of new      communities and keep building in line with pollution laws.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS</strong> may be used to blast      away sections of the Kra Isthmus canal across Thailand... a      proposed shortcut for 500,000-ton tankers carrying oil from      the Middle East to Japan. An estimated 34,000 million cubic      yards of earth will have to be moved during the      construction (compared with 327 million for the Panama      waterway). The use of atomic power is expected to shorten      excavation time from 12 to eight years and reduce costs by      2,000 million dollars. Plans involve using clusters of five      or six devices detonated in salvos for a total of 139      explosions amounting to 41 megatons.    </p>    <p>      Local residents will have to be evacuated, according to New      Scientist, a London publication, because fallout will      travel more than 350 miles and secondary radiation could      spread as far as 1,600 miles to the west. And what do the      folks who live there think? Chow Chowkwanyum, a key figure      in contract negotiations, complains, "Our problem is      education. People have a particular fear of this type of      device." Little wonder, Chow little wonder.    </p>
