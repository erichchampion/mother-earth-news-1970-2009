                		<h5 id="byline">by Elizabeth</h5>    <p>      Cool in summer and cold in winter, our old house is      somewhat of a challenge to heat , . . but we try always to      have warm beds. There's nothing like shivering at night to      make you worthless the next day.    </p>    <p>      Because fuel represents time, it was always scarce on our      farm when I was growing up in this house. The only fire      kept burning all night-and often the only daytime      blaze too-was banked in the kitchen stove so the pump      wouldn't freeze and the water in the reservoir would be      warm to take to the barn in the morning. It's not      surprising that we made up excuses to hang around the      kitchen as late as possible . . . just to avoid the nightly      traumatic battle with cold rooms and cold beds.    </p>    <p>      There have always been ways to raise the temperature of      beds to a comfortable level before crawling in: warming      pans, all kinds of hot water bottles, bags of heated salt      or sand (or letting someone else slip in between the frigid      covers before you). For years our family used one-gallon      maple syrup cans filled with hot water, then brought to the      kitchen in the morning to reheat all day on the back of the      stove. Sometimes the tins leaked, though-and hot      water does cool fast-so we started using flat      soapstones "heat up" enough to cook a casserole. (We      carried them in heavy, white salt sacks slung over our      shoulders, so that we looked like nightgowned Santa      Clauses. The warmth at the small of your back feels great      as you trek through the cold part of the house, but you      have to keep bouncing the bag when you do this or you could      have braised skin.)    </p>    <p>      The best way to use soapstone bed warmers is to place them      between the sheets half an hour before bedtime, then move      the rocks and lie on the warm spots. One bagged stone at      the feet and one at the back make a cozy night. The sacks      can be dragged around by foot or hand without touching the      superhot contents . . . and, as the heat lessens, can be      pulled up to lie flat against the back or legs.    </p>    <p>      Times have changed, of course, and my memory of the simpler      life's weary parts make me almost glad to see one of our      monthly bills: the statement from the electric company. For      five years now my daughter and I (our home's present      family) have used electric mattress pads bought from Sears.      They operate like soil-heating cables to give a slow,      gentle warmth with very little power, and-if turned      on a couple of hours in advance-warm the bed to the      perfect temperature by the time you're ready to climb in.      Except by making tents of the bedclothes, though, we've not      found a way to avoid cold noses.    </p>    <p>      Once you've got your nightly nest warm, the problem is      keeping its heat from escaping . . . and that means      insulating starting with the room itself. For the duration      of winter pull drapes or shades over the bedroom windows,      or cover the panes with newspaper. Since our sleeping      quarters are too cold to use for anything but that, the      lack of light doesn't matter. We come out of our darkened      caves a little later than the groundhog.    </p>    <p>      The bed, too, is more comfortable if insulated somewhere      under the mattress with a heavy layer of newspapers      (especially if you use a straw or feather tick). A bed      boxed in above with: drapes is cozier and freer from drafts      . . . as is one half-ringed with a mountainous range of      extra bedclothes or old coats to back up against.    </p>    <p>      Muslin or percale sheets are fine for summer, but in winter      we replace them with fuzzy cotton sheet-blankets. (A sponge      bath before turning in really saves on the wash.) Cove:      shouldn't be tucked under the mattress all around . . . the      should be loose enough that the sleeper can rock himself      into them to form a half cocoon.    </p>    <p>      One of our winter beds--not electrified-is      layered like this flat steel springs, newspapers, old rug,      mattress, old blanket cotton tick, feather tick, muslin      sheet, bottom sheet-blanket, top sheetblanket, woven wool      blanket, patchwork quilt woven cotton blanket,      cotton-batting-lined quilt. The last item is often      necessary, but so heavy it can be tiring. The quilt could      trade places with the feather tick, of course, but that' no      lightweight piece of equipment either . . . in fact, it      require almost as much effort to turn as a mattress.    </p>    <p>      The most satisfactory nightwear is outing flannel made into      long gowns or pajamas, always worn with heavy socks and      sometimes with long underwear or a sweater. Slippery      material are cold, and sleeping without clothing is a      matter of metabolism lism and mettle.    </p>    <p>      It was one of Grandmother's rules that a bed which has been      slept in for a spell needs special care before it's      assigned to a creature in need of warmth and sleep. There's      something more than just body heat missing from such a      nest, and Grandmother always gave loving attention to      warming and restoring it to its proper cradling function.    </p>    <p>      One way or another, may you be as warm as we are on long,      cold winter nights.    </p>
