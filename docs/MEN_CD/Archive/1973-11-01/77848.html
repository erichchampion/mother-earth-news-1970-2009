        	<hr />    		<hr />    <p>      <strong>GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF LAND</strong> , the United      States' most basic resource, is gathering momentum from      Washington officials. Congress, backed by the Nixon      administration, is trying to establish measures that could      affect millions of people... what they can do with their      property, where to build or buy new homes, and even where      you can spend your vacation.    </p>    <p>      There is still an estimated 10 acres for everyone in the      country, but the postwar "baby boom" is causing the      formation of 27,000 new households each week and, in the      next two decades, power plants and transmission lines alone      will take up over 5,000 square miles. Because of this      growth pattern, Hawaii has zoned every foot of its      territory, earmarking sections for urban, rural,      agricultural or conservation uses... California requires      special permits for coastal construction, while Maine,      Vermont, Florida, Washington and Oregon are trying to pass      laws to control a stampede of land speculators.    </p>    <p>      The Land Use Policy Act (S. 268), introduced for a second      time by Sen. Henry Jackson, D.-Wash., passed the Senate 64      to 21, but awaits reconciliation with differing House      proposals. If approved, participating states would share      100 million dollars to set up authorities to inventory land      and resources, regulate sales and developments, control      environmentally sensitive areas, influence locations of new      communities and keep building in line with pollution laws.    </p>
