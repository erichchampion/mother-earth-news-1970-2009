                          <p>      Here in north-central Indiana, there's nothing so final as      the first fall freeze. It means the end of red tomatoes and      green peppers and yellow corn. It means the end of      simmering pots of catsup and open crocks of pickles dining      on the kitchen counter. It means the end of summer.    </p>    <p>      And the start of some of the most frenzied activity of the      year. Activity more hectic than the canning season, more      bustling than spring housecleaning. We call it "Getting      Ready for Winter".    </p>    <p>      It all begins the morning after the first freeze. While the      pepper plants are still upright. Before the tomatoes wilt      and die. Before the sweet potato vines blacken.    </p>    <p>      We get up . . . yawn and stretch . . . look at the      thermometer outside the kitchen window . . . and are      <em>instantly</em> awake! There's no time for coffee or leisurely      barn chores. We pull on our heavy coats and fleece-lined      boots and head straight for the garden.    </p>    <p>      There are sweet potatoes to be dug and spread on the warm      furnace room floor. Hampers to be filled with the largest      green tomatoes before the vines die. (We carry the fruit      into the cellar, wrap each of the tomatoes in a square of      newspaper, and set them in a dark corner to ripen.)    </p>    <p>      We till the garden (while being careful to leave the bushy      clump of brussels sprouts and the delicate "ferns" that      mark the row of carrots); Cover the turnips with bales of      hay and rake leaves up around the last of the celery. Pull      the bean plants, pluck their dried pods, and take the plump      hulls inside to shell out later during long evenings around      the fireplace. Pick an armful of red and orange and yellow      zinnias and arrange them into one last bouquet. We chop the      cornstalks. We put the garden to bed.    </p>    <p>      And then we hurry on to prepare the rest of our little farm      for winter. Someone must take the chain saw to the woods .      . . slice last spring's fallen trees into neat, uniform      logs . . . and stack the fuel in orderly heaps by the back      door. And someone must put the storm windows on the house .      . . caulk around the doors . . . mulch the roses. Get a      move on! Below-zero dawns and boot-deep snow are on the      way!    </p>    <p>      We load the pickup with gunnysacks of ear corn, haul them      to the barn, run them through the shelter, and fill bins to      overflowing with the golden-yellow kernels. We bring bags      of oats and blocks of salt home from the grain elevator in      town. We check last summer's hay and fasten down the wooden      sidewalls by the goat stalls.    </p>    <p>      "Put new plastic on the chickenhouse windows next."    </p>    <p>      "Right. I'm going to clean the house too . . . and scrub      down the roosts and change the bedding in the nest boxes."    </p>    <p>      "Good idea. Spread the old litter on the asparagus bed . .      . and put a blanket of clean straw on the strawberry plants      while you're at it."    </p>    <p>      And as we button up the farm and stock the larder and stack      the fuel, we also store up memories for the long nights      ahead.    </p>    <p>      Memories of waist-high calves frolicking together in the      pasture . . . and moving farther each day from the watchful      eyes of their mothers. Memories of the spicy-sweet smell of      fall apples as we climb into the trees, pack the fruit into      boxes, and store them away in the cellar. Memories of the      rustling crunchy sound of red and gold leaves under the big      maples and the chattering of two blue jays in the fence      raw. Memories of a giant combine across the way as it      waddles down aisles of corn, gobbles the stalks in great      noisy gulps, and spews shelled grain into waiting wagons.    </p>    <p>      Yes, this is a busy time. A time of walnuts to be gathered      and sunflowers to be hulled. But it's also a time to just      stop and look. To just stop and enjoy.    </p>    <p>      For there are cold days ahead. Days when the skies will be      gray and the outlook bleak. And sometimes, during those      days, we'll need to look back and find that while we were      stocking our larder with the fruits of autumn . . . we were      restocking our sense of sight and sound and smell too.    </p>
