                    <p>      <strong>"PAPER POWER" LIGHTS HOMES IN ERIE,      PENNSYLVANIA.</strong> When the Hammermill Paper Company of      Erie, Pennsylvania found itself with an excess of steam      (generated by the burning of pulp wastes) on its hands,      company management decided to convert that steam to      electricity . . . and sell the juice to the Pennsylvania      Electric Company! Penelec agreed to the plan, and      now-as a result-2,500 Erie households receive      some 1,500,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month from      the paper company (through utility grid). The      Hammermill-Penelec pact may be the first of its kind in the      country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE EASTERN FEDERATION OF NUCLEAR OPPONENTS AND      SAFE ENERGY PROPONENTS</strong> is a new coalition of East      Coast organizations seeking to bring about a phase-out of      nuclear power. To this end, the Federation will [1] gather      and disperse information, [2] maintain liaison between      widely separated groups, and [3] attempt-by political      means-to promote the widespread use of      environmentally sound energy sources. Interested church,      labor, civic, and other groups are urged to contact the      Federation at 433 Orlando Ave., State College, Pa. 16801.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIRTY CRANKCASE OIL HAS THE SAME HEATING VALUE PER      GALLON AS FUEL OIL,</strong> so why not burn it for heating      purposes? Well, now you <em>can . . .</em> with a Kutrieb      Waste Oil Heater. The Kutrieb units-which will burn      fuel oil, crankcase oil, or hydraulic fluid (and put out      70,000 Btu's/hr. in the process)-come with or without      such options as heat guards, thermostats, and blowers, and      can be connected to any chimney or upright stovepipe.      Prices range from $309.95 to $495.00. Write to New Life      Organics, Prairie Farms, Wis. 54762 . . . and enclose at      least 50 cents to cover the cost of a reply.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRIVATE UTILITIES CHARGE USERS 60% MORE FOR      ELECTRICITY THAN PUBLIC POWER COMPANIES,</strong> according      to the Environmental Action Foundation's latest book,      <em>Taking Charge: A New Look at Public Power.</em> In      addition to explaining how citizens can take over their      private utilities, this attractive 110-page volume cites      the accomplishments of the nation's 3,000 publicly owned      power companies in such areas as energy conservation, solar      energy development, and rate structure reform. An      exceedingly well executed book from every standpoint. For      your copy, send $2.50 to: Environmental Action Foundation,      Dupont Circle Building, Suite 724, Washington, D.C. 20036.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT MAY BE THIS COUNTRY'S ONLY WIND-POWERED      COMMERCIAL RADIO STATION</strong> is now operating in the      town of Oak Creek, Colorado. Elliott Bayly-founder      and electrical engineer in charge of KFMU (103.9 on the FM      dial)-chose to power the station's 55-watt      transmitter with a recycled Jacobs wind generator that cost      less than $2,000 to install . . . rather than spend $15,000      to run electric powerlines to the mountaintop transmitter      site. The result: KFMU is now "the sound of the wind".    </p>    <p>      <strong>FARMS MAY GET METHANE DIGESTERS AT GOVERNMENT      EXPENSE.</strong> Under a bill introduced in the U.S.      Senate by Gaylord Nelson (D-Wis.), the Department of      Agriculture would administer $5,000 grants to "at least"      100 farms (each of which, to qualify, must be no larger      than 640 acres) for the construction of small bio-gas      plants that would convert manure into methane. Says Nelson:      "This technology might help insulate the small farmer from      rising energy prices and turn what now often is a      liability-organic waste-into assets [in the      form of] gas and fertilizer."    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN ALL-NEW SOLAR ENERGY BIBLIOGRAPHY/BOOK      CATALOG</strong> has just been released by International      Compendium (an independent trade division of Solar Science      Industries, Inc.). Three-fourths of the 200 titles listed      in the handsome 44-page booklet are annotated, and      <em>all</em> are stocked by IC .... making that group      perhaps <em>the</em> most complete mail-order source of      solar energy publications. To get your copy of this      informative bibliography, send $2.00 to International      Compendium, 10762 Tucker St., Beltsville, Md. 20705.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHETHER YOU LIVE IN THE MIDWEST OR NOT,</strong>      you'll want to subscribe to <em>Acorn,</em> the newsletter      of the Midwest Energy Alternatives Network (a non-profit      group functioning as an information exchange for      Midwesterners working in energy). Although the tabloid      is-at present-only eight pages long, each of      those 11-1/2" X 17" pages is cram-packed with features,      bibliographies, and hard-to-get access info. A one-year      subscription ($4.00) brings you five meaty <em>Acorns      plus</em> a BIG Midwest Access Catalog (BIG MAC). Send your      check to Midwest Energy Alternatives Network, Governors      State University, Park Forest South, III. 60466.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NUKE IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD?</strong> According to      latest government statistics, 238 nuclear power plants are      either operable, under construction, or planned in the U.S.      today. (Of that number, 60 plants fall in the "operable"      category.) The only states that do not now have-and      aren't slated to get-nuclear generating stations are      Rhode Island, West Virginia, Kentucky, New Mexico, Nevada,      Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas. We thought      you'd like to know.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IF YOU'RE THINKING OF BUYING A WOOD-BURNING STOVE      THIS WINTER</strong> -or even if you aren't-you'd do      well to send away for <em>RAIN paper No. 1: Wood</em>      Stoves, a compilation of letters, articles, and charts      (taken from RAIN magazine) on the selection, operation, and      repair of wood-burners (including cookstoves). The section      on "Twenty Causes of Chimney Troubles and Their Cures"      alone is easily worth the $1.00 ppd. that the folks at RAIN      are asking for the info packet. Their address: 2270 N.W.      Irving, Portland, Ore. 97210:    </p>
