                <p>      In MOTHER NO. 41, Bill Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi explained      the art of preparing tofu. Below, we are shown just a few      of the many exciting ways in which this versatile and      nutritious food can be served.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By WILLIAM SHURTLEFF & AKIKO AOYAGI    </h5>    <p>      From <em>The Book of Tofu,</em> copyright 1975 by William      Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi. Excerpts used by permission of      Autumn Press, Inc.    </p>    <h3>TOFU BAKED</h3>    <p>      Tofu may be used with excellent results in the baked dishes      of countries throughout the world. It goes particularly      well with all dairy products and with grains. The Japanese      often sauté and season their vegetables with a      little shoyu or miso (and sugar) before adding them to tofu      baked dishes in order to give a richer and more distinctive      flavor. Always use pressed tofu in casseroles where a firm      or slightly dry consistency is desired. Experiment freely      using tofu in your favorite recipes for oven cookery. Since      baking-which uses a relatively large amount of fuel      or energy-has never been a traditional Japanese way      of cooking foods, most of the following recipes are      typically Western.    </p>    <h3>TOFU ITALIAN MEATBALLS</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 2 OR 3)</p><p>A remarkably good facsimile of its      namesake, this preparation is one of the many creative and      delicious tofu recipes served as part of the vegetarian      cuisine at Tokyo's Seventh-Day Adventist Hospital.   </p>   <p>    1/2      ounces tofu, well pressed (see the sidebar with this      article) or squeezed<br />      1/4 cup chopped walnut meats<br />      1/2 onion, minced<br />      1/4 to 1/3 cup bread crumbs<br />      1 egg, lightly beaten<br />      3 tablespoons minced parsley<br />      Dash of pepper<br />      4 teaspoons red miso (see MOTHER NO. 39, page 41)<br />      or 1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      Oil for deep-frying<br />      1/4 cup tomato juice or tomato soup<br />      1/4 cup ketchup<br />      Dash of oregano<br />      3 tablespoons<br />      Parmesan or grated cheese    </p>    <p> Combine the first seven      ingredients and 1 tablespoon miso. Mix well and shape into      1-1/2-inch balls. Heat oil to 350° in a wok, skillet,      or deep-fryer. Drop in balls and deep-fry until cooked      through and well browned. Drain balls, then arrange in a      loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350°. Combine remaining 1      teaspoon miso with tomato juice and ketchup, mixing to form      a sauce, and pour over tofu balls. Top with a sprinkling of      cheese and bake for 15 minute, or until nicely browned. For      best flavor, allow to stand for 6 to 8 hours. Serve hot or      cold, as is, or as a topping for spaghetti.    </p>    <h3>      MUSHROOM & ONION CASSEROLE WITH TOFU    </h3>    <p>      (SERVES 3)</p>    <p>2 onions, diced<br />      8 mushrooms, thinly sliced<br />      1 tomato, cut into thin wedges<br />      1 teaspoon oil<br />      1 pint yogurt<br />      2 ounces dried onion soup or mushroom soup<br />      24 ounces tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes      2 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds    </p>    <p> Preheat oven to      350°. Combine the first three ingredients in a bowl and      mix lightly. Layer one-half of mixture at the bottom of a      lightly oiled casserole. Combine yogurt and dried onion      soup in a bowl, mixing well. Pour one-fourth of yogurt-soup      mixture over vegetables in casserole, and top with a layer      of one-half of the tofu and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds. Then      pour another one-fourth of the yogurt mixture over the      tofu. Use the remaining ingredients to form an identical      series of layers. Bake for 30 minutes.    </p>    <h3>TOFU-CHEESE SOUFFLÉ</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 4)</p>   <p>3 slices of whole wheat bread<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      6 ounces tofu, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices<br />      6 ounces (sharp cheddar) cheese, grated<br />      1 tablespoon chopped onion or 1/4 teaspoon onion      powder<br />      1-1/4 cups milk (soy or dairy)<br />      2 eggs, lightly beaten<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt or 2 tablespoons red miso    </p>    <p>      Dash of pepper Butter the bread and tear each slice into 4      or 5 pieces. Coat a casserole lightly with butter, then      layer bread, tofu, cheese, and onion, repeating the layers      until all ingredients are used. Combine milk, eggs, salt or      miso, and pepper, and pour into the casserole. Allow to      stand for 1 to 2 hours. Bake casserole in a pan of water      for 45 minutes in a preheated 350° oven.    </p>    <h3>TOFU LOAF WITH ONIONS AND CHEESE</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 4)</p>    <p>4 tablespoons butter<br />      2 tablespoons whole wheat flour<br />      1 cup milk (soy or dairy)<br />      3/4 teaspoon salt<br />      1 onion, minced<br />      4 ounces cheese, diced<br />      12 ounces tofu, pressed (see sidebar) and mashed<br />      1/4 cup bread or cracker crumbs    </p>    <p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter      in a skillet. Add flour and sauté until fragrant and      lightly browned. Gradually add 1-1/2 cups milk, stirring      constantly, to form a smooth brown sauce. Season with the      salt, then simmer until sauce is thick. Stir in onion,      cheese, and tofu and remove from heat. Coat a pie tin with      1 tablespoon butter and fill with tofusauce mixture.      Sprinkle on bread crumbs and dot with remaining 1      tablespoon butter. Bake in a 350° oven for about 15      minutes, or until set.    </p>    <h3>SAVORY TOFU-PUMPKIN DELIGHT</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 4)</p>   <p> 2 tablespoons oil<br />      1/2 onion, thinly sliced<br />      <em>3</em> cups boiled and mashed <em>kabocha</em> or      pumpkin<br />      12 ounces tofu, pressed (see sidebar) and diced<br />      1 egg, lightly beaten<br />      <em>3</em> tablespoons shoyu (see MOTHER NO. <em>39,</em>      page <em>41)<br /></em> <em>3</em> tablespoons natural      sugar<br />      Dash of salt<br />      Dash of cinnamon or <em>sansho</em> pepper (optional)    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to <em>350°.</em> Heat a large skillet or      wok and coat with 1 tablespoon oil. Sauté onion      until lightly browned, then turn off heat. Add pumpkin,      tofu, egg, shoyu, sugar, and salt, mixing well. Coat a pie      tin with 1 tablespoon oil and spoon in the tofu mixture.      Sprinkle with cinnamon or <em>sansho.</em> Bake for about      <em>15</em> minutes, or until set.    </p>    <h3>TOFU & PUMPKIN PATTIES</h3>   <p>      (MAKES 8)</p>   <p>      2 cups boiled and mashed <em>kabocha</em> or      pumpkin<br />      24 ounces tofu, pressed (see sidebar) and mashed<br />      1 tablespoon salt<br />      Dash of pepper<br />      1 teaspoon of oilI<br />      1/3 cup raisins<br />      2 ounces cheese, grated or diced<br />      2 tablespoons butter    </p>    <p> Preheat oven to 350° <em>.</em>      Combine pumpkin and tofu in a large bowl, mixing well, and      season with salt and pepper.

Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Or      bake in a pie shell as for pumpkin pie.    </p>    <h3>BAKED POTATOES WITH TOFU STUFFING</h3>   <p>      (SERVES 6 TO 8)</p>    <p>4 potatoes, baked and cut lengthwise into      halves<br />      12 ounces tofu, pressed (see sidebar)<br />      2 ounces cheese, grated or diced<br />      1 /2 teaspoon salt<br />      Dash of pepper<br />      1-1/2 tablespoons butter<br />      1 onion, minced    </p>    <p>      1 tablespoon oil Preheat oven to <em>350°. Scoop</em>      potato out of shells, then spoon 1 cup of potato into a      mixing bowl and reserve the remainder. Mash tofu and cheese      with potato in bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Melt      butter in a skillet and sauté onions until nicely      browned. Mix onions into potatotofu mixture, then divide      the mixture among the potato shells. Coat a cookie tin with      the oil and bake stuffed potatoes on tin for about 30      minutes, or until nicely browned. Delicious served topped      with butter (or sour cream) and minced chives (or parsley).    </p>    <h3>TOFU IN BREAKFAST EGG DISHES</h3>    <p>      One of the easiest and most delicious ways to incorporate      tofu into your breakfast menu is by serving it in      traditional Western-style egg preparations. Tofu goes well      with cheese and all those vegetables which lend variety and      zest to egg dishes.    </p>    <h3>TOFU SAUTÉED IN BUTTER WITH      SCRAMBLED EGGS</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 2)</p>    <p>1 tablespoon butter<br />      6 ounces tofu<br />      2 eggs, lightly beaten<br />      Salt and pepper    </p>    <p> Melt the butter in a skillet. Add tofu and      mash, then sauté over medium heat until lightly      browned. Add eggs and scramble until firm. Season with salt      and pepper. If desired, sauté any of the following      together with the tofu: chives, bean or alfalfa sprouts,      crushed garlic, mushrooms, scallions or onions, green      peppers or lotus root (each diced or thinly sliced). Season      with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon shoyu.    </p>   <h3>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH TOFU AND MUSHROOMS</h3>      <p>(SERVES 4)</p>    <p>12 ounces tofu, pressed      (see sidebar) and mashed<br />      <em>3</em> eggs, lightly beaten<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      1 cup diced fresh mushrooms<br />      1/4 teaspoon salt<br />      Dash of pepper Combine tofu and eggs in a bowl and mix      well. Melt the butter in a skillet. Add mushrooms and      sauté for several minutes until fragrant and tender.      Pour in tofuegg mixture and scramble until firm. Season      with salt and pepper. Serve hot or cold.    </p>    <h3>TOFU IN SALADS</h3>    <p>      Tofu is a wonderful addition to almost any salad. Its soft      texture complements the crisp crunchiness of fresh vegeta      bles. And because tofu has so few calories per gram of      protein, tofu salads can be enjoyed by weight-watchers.      Tofu can take at least 6 different forms when served in      salads. Mashed or squeezed and lightly seasoned, it      resembles cottage or ricotta cheese. Lightly drained and      cubed, it can be used with or in place of croutons. Well      pressed and diced, it has the texture of soft cheese and      goes well in marinated salads. Parboiled and crumbled, it      may be used to keep a salad light. Reshaped and cut into      thin strips, it has the consistency of firm cheese or ham.      Finally, blended and seasoned, tofu can be turned into a      variety of rich and creamy salad dressings.    </p>    <h3>WESTERN-STYLE SHIRA-AE</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 2 OR 3)</p>   <p>1 cucumber, cut into thin ovals<br />      3 celery stalks, diced<br />      6 ounces tofu pressed (see sidebar) and mashed<br />      4 teaspoons sugar<br />      1 /2 teaspoon salt<br />      4 teaspoons peanut butter or sesame butter<br />      4 teaspoons rice vinegar</p>   <p>      Combine the first five ingredients      in a large mixing bowl. Cream the peanut butter and vinegar      in a separate cup and pour over the tofu mixture. Mix all      ingredients together lightly. For best flavor, chill before      serving.    </p>    <h3>MUSHROOM TOMATO SALAD WITH CRUMBLED TOFU</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 4)</p>			<p>4 lettuce leaves<br />      4 small tomatoes, thinly sliced<br />      4 large fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced<br />      12 ounces tofu, crumbled (see sidebar)<br />      1 tablespoon minced parsley</p><p> Dressing:<br />      <br />      1 tablespoon shoyu<br />      1/2 cup salad oil<br />      1/4 cup lemon juice 1/2 clove of garlic, crushed or minced    </p>    <p>      Dash of pepper Arrange lettuce leaves on serving dishes and      distribute tomato slices around edges of leaves. Combine      mushrooms and tofu and divide among the 4 lettuce leaves.      Top with a sprinkling of parsley, then the dressing.    </p>    <h3>TOFU DESSERTS</h3>    <p>      Tofu can be adapted to fresh fruit purees, whipped cream      toppings, puddings, dessert souffles, Japanese-style      confections . . . even cheesecake. In each of these      preparations, nigari tofu gives by far the best flavor and      consistency. Most take only a few minutes to prepare and,      containing little sweetening, can also be used as side      dishes at any meal.    </p>    <h3>TOFU WHIPPED CREAM OR YOGURT</h3>    <p>      (MAKES 1-1/2 CUPS)    </p>    <p>     This delicious dish can be used like      whipped cream or, as the basis of desserts, like yogurt.    </p>    <p>      12 ounces tofu <br />      2 tablespoons honey or natural sugar<br />      Dash of salt (optional)<br />      1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)    </p>    <p>      Combine all      ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth. To serve      as yogurt, top with a sprinkling of slivered almonds or      walnut meats, shredded coconut, and raisins.      </p><h3>TOFU-FRUIT WHIPS</h3>			<p>      (SERVES 2 OR 3)</p>    <p> These refreshing summertime desserts can be      transformed into high-protein breakfast dishes by reducing      or eliminating the sweetening.</p>    <p> 1/2 pound fresh strawberries or peaches<br />      12 ounces tofu, chilled<br />      2 tablespoons honey or natural sugar<br />      Chopped nutmeats or sunflower seeds (optional)    </p>    <p> Combine all      ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth. If      desired, top with nutmeats. Serve immediately in small      dessert dishes or use as a topping for pancakes, crepes, or      waffles. Prepare the following variations as in the basic      recipe:    </p>    <h3>BANANA-LEMON WHIP</h3>    <p>      2 small bananas<br />      6 ounces tofu<br />      juice of 1/2 lemon<br />      1 to 2 tablespoons honey<br />      1/2 teaspoon sesame butter (optional)<br />      Dash of nutmeg (optional)    </p>    <h3>COCONUT-RAISIN WHIP</h3>    <p>      1/2 cup shredded coconut<br />      1/4 cup raisins<br />      12 ounces tofu<br />      3 tablespoons marmalade    </p>    <h3>BANANA-RAISIN WHIP</h3>    <p>      2 bananas<br />      1/4 cup raisins<br />      6 ounces tofu<br />      1 teaspoon honey<br />      1/4 cup toasted wheat germ<br />      Dash of nutmeg (optional)    </p>    <h3>HONEY-LEMON WHIP</h3><p>1 tablespoon lemon      juice<br />      1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind (optional)<br />      1 tablespoon honey<br />      6 ounces tofu    </p>    <h3>TOFU-ORANGE JUICE PURE WITH TANGERINES</h3>    <p>      (SERVES 4)</p>			<p>12 ounces tofu, pressed (see sidebar)    <br />      1 cup orange juice<br />      1 tablespoon honey<br />      1 cup tangerine or orange sections, drained    </p>   <p>      Combine the      first three ingredients in a blender and puree until      smooth. Stir in the tangerine sections, spoon into dessert      cups, and chill for several hours.    </p>    <p>      Related articles:<br />      Preparatory Techniques    </p>
