        <p>"Energy efficiency" and "historic building" are terms that almost never find themselves in the same sentence. But the people at Ecotrust and ShoreBank Pacific recently opened a building that is the epitome of both.</p><p>The new Jean Vollum Natural Capital Center in Portland, Oregon, is a rescued 19th-century warehouse that after extensive green remodeling will house the headquarters of Ecotrust, a nonprofit promoter of a conservation economy, and organizations such as ShoreBank Pacific, the nation's first environmental bank. Patagonia, an outdoor clothing company, will also set up shop inside.</p><p>The restoration included several green building practices, such as:</p><p>• a 97 percent rate of recycling and reclamation of construction debris;<br />• a green roof of native plants and bioswales to absorb and filter storm water, protecting the nearby Willamette River;<br />• prime outdoor and indoor parking for bicycles;<br />• nontoxic and low-toxic paints and adhesives;<br />• an advanced ventilation system and windows that open.</p>
