        <p><em>My mom tells stories of the best bread she's ever tasted, and it came from</em><em>MOTHER EARTH</em><em>NEWS sometime in 1980. She says I helped my dad make it while she was studying when she was in school at the University of Houston.</em></p><p><em>I think it was just called Skillet Bread, something like a pita or nan. Do you have this recipe?</em></p><p><em>Khajha Kirschner<br /></em>Mountlake Terrace, Washington</p><p>Khajha, here is the recipe. It was called "Simple Bread" and ran in January 1980, Issue #61. The following is adapted from the original article written by Jerry Nelson.</p><p>Simple Bread is highly nutritious, good tasting, inexpensive and easy to prepare. Cooking it demands an average of only 15 minutes of labor a day.</p><p>All you need to make a batch are: 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of soy flour, 1/4 cup of brewers yeast, 2/3 teaspoon of salt, and 1 1/3 cups of water.</p><p>To begin making your batch of Simple Bread, combine dry ingredients, add water and work the batter around until the moisture is absorbed. Then put the ball of dough on a floured table and knead it for a few minutes until it becomes springy to the touch.</p><p>Pull off a piece of dough a little larger than a golf ball and roll it out into a 7- to 8-inch "tortilla." You should get about 12 flat cakes from the recipe. As you finish rolling each piece, place it on a dry, hot griddle or iron skillet.</p><p>If your cooking surface is the right temperature, the dough will form small bubbles in its surface after about a minute. In approximately 2 minutes, the underside will be brown in spots, and the bread will be ready to flip. When the other side is also brown, remove the finished bread with a spatula. You can vary the water content and cooking time to give your "loaves" the flexibility or crispness that suits your taste.</p><p>It is true that Simple Bread may take a little getting used to, but I actually find it preferable to conventional loaves.</p><p>As I tear into this economical, highly nutritious, easy-to-prepare staff of life, I always am reminded that Simple Bread is simply marvelous.</p>
