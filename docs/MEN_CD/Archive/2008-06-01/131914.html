        <p>There’s never been a better time than now to learn about clean, renewable solar power. The experts at the nonprofit <a href="http://www.solarenergy.org/" title="Solar Energy International" target="_blank">Solar Energy International</a> (SEI) in Carbondale, Colo., offer some excellent classes, job training and workshops for the renewable energy novice and the solar power guru alike. You can learn how to design and construct a complete photovoltaic system for your home, how to start a solar-based business, how to build a solar water pump and much more. They even offer a three-day seminar on the ins and outs of the solar energy industry, complete with demonstrations on the latest gadgets, presentations from some of the trade’s most prominent representatives, and training on solar products and services.</p><p>But that’s not all: SEI also hosts workshops on residential wind systems, biodiesel and one five-day course on how to design and build homes made of natural materials, from straw bales to cob to earth bags. Visit <a title="SEI" href="http://www.solarenergy.org/workshops" target="_blank">SEI</a> for a complete class schedule including prices and locations (online courses also are available). And don’t procrastinate: They’re filling up fast.</p>
