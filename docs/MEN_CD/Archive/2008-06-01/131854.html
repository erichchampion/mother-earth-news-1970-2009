        <p>Global warming, peak oil, mortgage crisis, huge national debt, fears of a recession - it all makes many of us nervous, understandably so. There’s a flurry of new books about how to survive whatever’s ahead. Leading newspapers are running features about people who are stockpiling water and canned food, fearing the worst.</p><p>We’re thinking these are issues that you would like to discuss with each other. So, here’s a question to get things started: </p><p><strong>What steps would you take to prepare if you knew that five years from now everything would cost 10 times what it costs now -</strong> gas, food, electricity, solar panels, hybrid cars - everything, but your income would not change? What would you do now to be in a better place to cope?</p><ul><li><div>Do you have a bit of land and the skills to grow and preserve a good portion of your own food? If not, could you join with your neighbors and garden together on open land one of you owns?</div></li><li><div>What about fuel to warm your home? Do you know how much firewood you could produce from one acre?</div></li><li><div>What would it cost you to commute to your job if gas cost 10 times more - $30 per gallon? Should you consider moving closer to your work, or getting a vehicle that gets better mileage? Maybe invest in an electric bicycle?</div></li><li><div>Could you keep goats and learn to <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Real-Food/2008-06-01/Make-Easy-Cheese-Recipes.aspx" title="make your own cheese" target="_blank">make your own cheese</a>? If you don’t have much land, you could keep a couple of goats in a very small area and bring food to them. They love to eat twigs and leaves - perhaps you could harvest brush along public roadsides for their feed.</div></li><li><div>Chickens can be great, sustainable sources of eggs and meat, but remember - commercial feed would cost 10 times more than it does now, so could you grow their feed at home?</div></li><li><div>Would you plant some peach pits and have your <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2008-06-01/Grow-Free-Fruit-Trees.aspx" title="own peach orchard" target="_blank">own peach orchard</a>?</div></li><li><div>Could you <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Modern-Homesteading/2008-06-01/Homegrown-Medicine-Grow-Medicinal-Herbs.aspx" title="grow your own herbal medicines" target="_blank">grow your own herbal medicines</a>?</div></li><li><div>Or do you think it would be foolish to work to become more self-reliant, because you believe that if things got really bad, roving gangs with guns would steal your food and fuel?</div></li><li><div>Are you already 50 percent self-sufficient? 90 percent? Tell us how you did it, and how it feels.</div></li></ul><p>Do you despair that we may be doomed? Or are you determined to choose a course that you think will assure you and your family of a good life, full of delight, no matter what comes?</p><p>Whatever your perspective, we invite you to join the discussion in our <a title="forums" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/forums/forum.aspx?boardid=1202&g=topics&f=1550" target="_blank">forums</a>. - <em>Mother</em> </p><p>P.S.
