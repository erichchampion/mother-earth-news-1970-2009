        The rear leg was made of a 30"" length of 4 x 6 PT, notched at each side to accept a center-mortised, 8""-wide T that is also notched out at each side to accept the rear ends of the 2 x 4 grinder support beams. The joint is boxed with squares of plywood fastened with deck screws. The crushersupport assembly was originally held to the rear leg with an eye screw that runs down through the T and into the top of the leg beam. The screw was inadequate, and (after this photo was taken) we ran a length of threaded rod through the box sides and leg and bolted it at each end. Next time, we'll make the joint a dovetail
