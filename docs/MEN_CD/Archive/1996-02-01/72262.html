            		<p><strong>MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong></p>            <p><strong><strong>Whether you're an eco-soldier or your      belt's just a bit snug, a break from meat might make you      feel better.</strong></strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Anne Vassal</h5>    <p>      Photographs: Judd Pilissof; Food Styling: Jean-Robert      Rowley<br />    </p>        <p>      The first tune I converted to a vegetarian lifestyle was in      the early '70s, during my magical-mystery-tour phase. While      others at that time may have embraced vegetarianism out of      their concern for our furry friends, I didn't really care      if Wilber ended up as a package of bacon. My self-centered      quest was simply to feel and look better. This was an era      of vegetarian dining in which tofu was king and alfalfa      sprouts crowned everything. Since fat hadn't as yet become      evil, most meatless dishes could be found somewhere under a      mound of melted cheese. And a vegetarian over age 30?      Extremely rare.    </p>    <p>      But times have changed. I'm more or less a vegetarian      again, only now I'm on a middle-age-mystery tour ...and      finding out that I'm not alone. According to <em>Vegetarian      Times</em> magazine, there are more than 12 million      vegetarians in the United States. So what's the definition      of a vegetarian in this day and age anyway? Many folks      calling themselves vegetarians are really semi-vegetarians,      eating poultry or fish occasionally. (I fall into this      category.) Then there are the ovo-lacto vegetarians, who      exclude meat but include dairy products and eggs in their      diet. Finally, there are the vegans, who don't use any      dairy products but rely solely on grains and legumes for      protein sources. Should vegetarians be concerned about      getting enough protein? If they're eating a variety of      foods through out the day so that they're getting some      complete protein, then it shouldn't be a problem. The      average American eats twice as much protein as is needed      for optimal nutrition. In this case more isn't better,      because excess protein is linked to cancer, heart disease,      osteoporosis, kidney stress, and a shorter life span.    </p>    <p>      Aside from the money saved by cutting meat out of the      grocery bill, there are other reasons that motivate folks      to make the switch.    </p>    <p>      · Diet and health: For maintaining your ideal      weight, low-fat eating is easier if you subtract the meat,      because most of its calories are fat calories. After      finally waking up to the fact that our high-fat, meat-based      diets were killing us, the U.S.D.A. did away with the      famous "four food groups" in favor of the new "food      pyramid." (But not without a fuss from the beef and dairy      industries.) The pyramid advocates a diet based mostly on      plant proteins, which aren't associated with any health      risks except pesticides, but that's another story. Studies      have shown that cancer deaths are 40 percent less common      among vegetarians than meat-eaters. Vegetarians are also at      lower risk for diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and      kidney stones and gallstones. A high-fiber diet can also      prevent (ahem) constipation.    </p>    <p>      · Food safety: The world is full of bacteria and      bacteria loves meat. One third of all food poisoning comes      from poultry and red meat. At least half of the poultry      that's sold contains salmonella. Also, most of our      country's meat is raised with the "help" of antibiotics and      growth hormones. Because of this, deaths due to penicillin      and tetra cycline residues in meat occur every year. Sure,      food-borne pathogens do appear on vegetables, but it's not      as common. (The most recent outbreak was some apple cider      with traces of E. Coli that was made from apples that fell      on the ground.)    </p>    <p>      · Earth smarts: Cutting back on our meat consumption      is not only smart for our bodies, but also for the      environment. Oxygen-producing forests are chopped down to      make room for cattle grazing. Since it takes eight pounds      of grain to produce one pound of beef, the grain we feed to      livestock could feed five times our country's population.      We may be diligently recycling our cans, but are we      concerned about the waste that's perpetuated by our meat      consumption?    </p>    <p>      A vegetarian (or almost vegetarian) diet doesn't have to be      tofu-burgers and sprouts. Here are some meatless meals that      you can really sink your teeth into.    </p>        <p><strong>Spinach-Feta Quesadillas</strong></p>    <p>      The great thing about quesadillas is that they can be      filled with any ingredient that you have on hand. Try      serving them at room temperature for snacks when unexpected      guests come over. For a vegan version, use soy cheese or      omit the cheese and smear a little salsa on one side of the      tortilla to make your vegetable sandwich stick together. I      use sheep or goat's milk feta (domestic feta is made with      cow's milk) for this quesadilla.    </p>    <p>      <em>4 whole wheat flour tortillas (8-inch size)</em>      <em>about 6 ounces imported feta cheese, crumbled</em>      <em>1 small red pepper, sliced into thin strips</em> <em>1      small red onion, sliced into thin circles</em> <em>2 cups      fresh spinach leaves, stems removed and cut into thin      strips<br />      canola oil</em>    </p>    <p>      Pour a drop of oil into a large frying pan (nonstick is      better) and saute the peppers and onions. Remove from the      pan and set aside. Smear a few more drops of oil in the pan      and heat on medium until hot. Place a tortilla in the pan      and sprinkle on some cheese, peppers, onions, and spinach.      Place another tortilla on top.    </p>    <p>      Saute until the bottom tortilla is medium brown, then flip      over. Brown that side, remove from the pan, and slice into      quarters or eighths. Makes two quesadillas.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Eggplant Parmesan with      Polenta</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      This is an easy dish for entertaining, because the sauce      and polenta can be made a day in advance. For a vegan      version, omit the cheese and sprinkle with fresh herbs.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Polenta:</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup coarsely ground yellow cornmeal<br /></em>      <em>(polenta*)</em> <em>3/4 teaspoon salt</em> <em>3 cups      cold water</em> <em>olive oil<br /></em>    </p>            <p>      Whisk together the cornmeal, salt, and water in a large      saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring      occasionally. Reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered for      10 to 15 minutes until it thickens and pulls away from the      sides of the pan, continuing to stir every few minutes.      Spread the polenta into an 8or 9-inch square cake pan and      refrigerate for at least one hour. Remove when well chilled      and slice into four squares. Slice the squares in half      diagonally into eight triangles. Turn on the broiler. Brush      the triangles on top and bottom with olive oil and place on      a foil-covered baking sheet. Broil until crispy and lightly      browned, watching carefully so they don't burn. Flip over      and broil on the other side. Place the triangles in a      baking or lasagna pan a half inch apart. Set aside.    </p>    <p>      *Polenta can be purchased where Italian foods are sold, or      at a health food store.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Tomato Sauce</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon olive oil</em> <em>1 small onion, finely      chopped</em> <em>4 large cloves garlic, minced</em>      <em>6-8 fresh plum tomatoes or 4-5 garden tomatoes      (or drained, canned plum tomatoes)</em> <em>1/4 cup dry      white wine</em> <em>2 tablespoons tomato paste (Freeze the      rest in a baggie.)</em> <em>1 teaspoon sugar</em> <em>1      teaspoon dried basil</em> <em>1/8 teaspoon cayenne      pepper</em> <em>freshly ground black pepper</em> <em>salt      to taste</em>    </p>    <p>      If you're using fresh tomatoes, bring a pot of water to a      boil. Turn off the heat and place the tomatoes in the water      for about two minutes (to loosen the skins). Remove the      tomatoes and slide off the skins, discarding them. Chop the      tomatoes into half-inch pieces. In the pot, saute the onion      and garlic in the olive oil until soft. Add the rest of the      ingredients and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes,      stirring occasionally. If the sauce isn't thick enough, add      a little extra tomato paste.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Eggplant Parmesan</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 medium eggplant, cut into 1/4-inch circles</em>      <em>1-1 1/2 cups skim mozzarella cheese, grated</em>      <em>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</em>      <em>chopped fresh herbs such as basil, oregano, and thyme      (optional)</em> <em>olive oil</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 400°. Grease a foillined baking sheet      with olive oil. Place the eggplant slices on the foil and      lightly brush with olive oil. Bake for about 10 minutes      until the tops are lightly browned. Flip over and bake for      another 10 minutes until tender. Remove the eggplant and      reduce the oven temperature to 350°. Lay the eggplant      slices on top of the polenta triangles. Spoon on the sauce      and sprinkle with mozzarella and then Parmesan. Bake for      about 20 minutes until the cheese is lightly browned.      Served topped with fresh herbs.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Vegetable Curry with      Couscous</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      This hearty stew will fill you up so you won't miss the      meat.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em> <em>3 Large cloves garlic,      minced</em> <em>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled, am d      minced</em> <em>1 teaspoon minced jalapeno pepper,      seeded</em> <em>1 teaspoon ground cumin</em> <em>2      teaspoons curry powder teaspoon turmeric</em> <em>2      teaspoons sugar teaspoon salt</em> <em>freshly ground      pepper</em> <em>3 small sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into      1-inch chunks</em> <em>6 small red or white-skinned      potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces</em> <em>2 cups vegetable      broth or water</em> <em>1 small eggplant, cut into 1-inch      pieces (about 2 cups)</em> <em>2 cups cauliflower, cut into      1-inch flowers</em> <em>1 cup canned garbanzo beans, rinsed      and drained</em> <em>2 tablespoons tomato paste</em>    </p>    <p>      Saute the garlic, ginger, and jalapeno in a large pot for      about 30 seconds. Stir in the rest of the spices. Add both      the potatoes and broth. Cover the pan and simmer for about      30 minutes until the potatoes are almost done. Add the rest      of the ingredients and simmer with the lid ajar for about      20 minutes until the vegetables are just tender, being      careful not to let them get mushy. While they're cooking,      prepare the couscous.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Couscous</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups whole wheat or- regular couscous</em> <em>1 1/2      cups boiling water teaspoon cinnamon</em> <em>chopped      parsley</em>    </p>    <p>      Place the couscous and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl or      pot. Pour the boiling water on the couscous and stir just      to mix. Cover with a lid and let sit untouched for 20      minutes. Remove the lid and fluff the couscous with a fork.      Serve topped with the curry and fresh parsley.    </p>    <p>      *Couscous can be purchased at health food stores and the      ethnic-food section of the supermarket.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Southwestern Beans 'n' Rice      Salad</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Instead of the usual vegetarian beans and rice, try this      high-protein salad.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Dressing</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons mild oil (canola)</em> <em>2 tablespoons      tomato paste</em> <em>1/3 cup fresh lime juice</em> <em>a      few dashes of hot sauce</em> <em>2 cloves garlic,      minced</em> <em>1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder</em> <em>1      teaspoon ground cumin</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon ground      coriander</em> <em>salt and pepper to taste</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Salad</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 package (16 oz.) firm or extra firm tofu,</em>      <em>cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</em> <em>4 cups cooked brown      rice (I use basmati' rice.)</em> <em>1 cup fresh or frozen      cooked corn</em> <em>1 15-oz. can red beans, rinsed,      drained</em> <em>1 poblano or green pepper, chopped</em>      <em>1 small red onion, finely chopped</em> <em>1/4 cup      chopped cilantro leaves</em> <em>toppings (optional):</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Grated cheddar cheese, chopped tomatoes, chopped green      onion</em>    </p>    <p>      Prepare the rice the day before and refiigerate so it won't      be sticky. Whisk the dressing ingredients together in a      large bowl. Toss the tofu cubes into the dressing and then      toss in the rest of the ingredients. Serve with toppings if      desired.    </p>    <p>      *Basmati rice can be found in the ethnic-food section of      the supermarket.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Banana Cake (nondairy)</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      This easy, low-fat cake bakes best on a low humidity, cool      day. For a two-layer cake, double the recipe using two      pans.    </p>    <p>      Line the bottoms with wax paper cut to fit.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Cake: one layer</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons mild oil (canola)</em> <em>1/3 cup real      maple syrup</em> <em>1</em> <em>teaspoon vanilla</em> <em>1      teaspoon instant espresso powder (optional)</em> <em>1      teaspoon cinnamon</em> <em>dash salt</em> <em>1/2 package      "Mori-Nu" silken tofu (10.5 oz.), save the other half</em>      <em>3/4</em> <em>cup mashed bananas (about two)</em> <em>1      1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon sifted whole wheat pastry flour      or unbleached white (lour</em> <em>1 teaspoon baking      powder</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly grease the bottom of an      8- or 9-inch round cake pan. Pulse together all the      ingredients up to and including bananas in a food processor      (or blender). Blend until smooth. Add the flour, baking      powder, soda, and pulse just until blended. Don't overmix.      Pour into the pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, just until      light brown and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.      Don't overbake-the cake should be moist.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Frosting</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 package silken tofu (the other half)</em> <em>1/2      cup nondairy, barley malt sweetened chocolate chips (If you      eat dairy, you could also use regular chocolate      chips.)</em> <em>2 tablespoons real maple syrup</em> <em>1      teaspoon vanilla</em>    </p>    <p>      Place the chocolate chips and maple syrup in a glass      measuring cup. Cook the chocolate, with two inches of      water, in a microwave or a saucepan, just until melted.      Blend all the ingredients in the food processor until      smooth. Taste for additional sweetener. Pour into a bowl      and refrigerate for about one hour until it thickens. (You      can speed up this process if you stick it in the freezer      and stir every few minutes.) After the cake has cooled,      spread on the frosting.    </p>    <p>      If you're making a layer cake, remove the layers from the      pans by loosening with a butter knife. Peel off the wax      paper. Frost the bottom layer, then the top and let the      frosting drip down the sides a bit. Decorate the top with      chocolate chips or a few strawberry halves around the edge.    </p>
