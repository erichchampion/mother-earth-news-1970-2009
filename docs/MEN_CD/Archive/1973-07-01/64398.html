                    <h5 id="byline">      by FAITH B. LASHER    </h5>		<hr />    <p>      The elderberry-well known to our pioneer      grandparents-is often overlooked today as a supply of      good eating, vim and vitality (and maybe even healing ... a      Danish friend tells me that his countrymen treat the common      cold with a syrup made from this excellent natural source      of vitamin C). Such neglect is unfortunate, since these      generous bushes grow wild in many parts of the country.      Ripe fruit can be found in low, warm areas starting in      mid-July, and the season lasts until midSeptember at higher      attitudes.<br />    </p>    <p>      When you go out hunting elderberries, seek the blue variety      <em>(Sambucus canadensis)</em> and not the red      <em>(Sambucus pubens)</em> ... the latter are distasteful      and in some areas even poisonous. Don't worry about      confusing the two, though, for they look quite different.      The toxic plant produces bright-red fruit in dome-shaped      bunches, while its edible cousin bears a flat cluster of      rich-blue to purple-black berries with a whitish, "dusted"      surface appearance. The riper the pickings, the more      frosted they become. In fact-when fully      ripe-these wild delights look very much as if Mother      Nature had dipped them in powdered sugar.<br />    </p>    <p>      The sugared look is deceptive, however... raw elderberries      are tart, not very appetizing, and must be cooked to come      into their own. Though the fruit is small and inclined to      be seedy, this slight drawback is outweighed by its      distinctive fresh taste and its versatility in the      kitchen.<br />    </p>    <p>      Here's a hint that will make any berrying expedition      easier: Carry a small bucket with a bail and wear a heavy      leather belt on which you can sling the pail when you get      to work. That way your container will be suspended at your      waist within easy reach and you'll have both hands free for      easier and faster picking. If you plan to gather large      quantities, take along another receptacle to collect the      contents of your filled bucket.<br />    </p>    <p>      And another, more important pointer: No good forager, of      course, breaks down or tramples fruit-bearing bushes. Be      just as careful in harvesting and moving through a wild      patch as you would if the berries were cultivated. You, or      someone else, will want to come back and gather more. And      always spare some of the booty for the birds and animals      which depend oil that source for their food. You'll still      have plenty to eat if you leave those branches partly      loaded ... but if the shrubs are stripped, other creatures      may go hungry.<br />    </p>    <p>      When you pick elderberries, snip the clusters just below      the fruit itself. Then separate the berries from the stems      in a cool and shady spot (or even seated comfortably before      the TV The individual morsels are small, as I've mentioned,      and the cleaning process takes quite a while. I've heard of      using a comb for this purpose but never acquired the knack      myself.<br />    </p>    <p>      All that work of sorting through your harvest will be      repaid many times over when you enjoy the tasty dishes you      can make with this free-for-the-gathering treat. Here are      some elderberry recipes from my kitchen:<br />    </p>      <h3>        ELDERBERRY JELLY      </h3>      <p>        The most common use of elderberries is for jelly-making.        Their juice produces a clear, ruby-red jewel-like        delicacy with a sparkling flavor to match.<br />      </p>      <p>        3 pounds elderberries<br />        juice of 1 lemon<br />        1 box fruit pectin<br />        4 1/2 cups sugar<br />      </p>    <p>      Heat the berries over a low fire until the juice starts to      flow and then simmer the fruit for 15 minutes. Strain the      liquid through a double layer of cheesecloth (easier if you      cook the fruit in the evening and let it drain overnight).      Mix the elderberry and lemon juices along with just enough      water to make three cups of fluid. Add the pectin, bring      the mixture to a boil and stir in the sugar. Bring the      jelly to a full boil again for one minute, pour it into      sterilized glasses and cover the jars with paraffin. (Does      anyone have a comparable recipe that uses honey instead of      white sugar? -MOTHER.)    </p>      <h3>        SPICED ELDERBERRIES      </h3>		<p>      10 cups ripe elderberries<br />      5 cups sugar<br />      2 tsp. ground cinnamon<br />      1/2 tsp. allspice<br />      1/2 tsp. ground cloves<br />      1 cup vinegar		</p>	    <p>      Cook the berries about 20 minutes, until they're slightly      soft. (Stir very frequently while cooking.) Add the other      ingrdients and heat the mixture until it has barely      thickened. (Test the consistency by dripping some of the      solution from a spoon ... the juice should divide into      drops instead of flowing off in a stream.) When that stage      is reached, pour the fruit into hot, sterilized jars and      seal the tops.    </p>      <h3>        CANNED ELDERBERRIES      </h3>      <p>        This delicious concoction can be used for many of the        same purposes as cranberry sauce.      </p>      <p>        4 cups berries<br />        1/2 cup sugar      </p>    <p>      Heat the berries over a low fire until the juice begins to      run. Add the sugar (use more if you like your fruit sweet)      and cook the combination until the liquid boils and all the      crystals are dissolved. Pour the mixture at once into hot,      sterilized jars and seal.    </p>    <h3>      FROZEN ELDERBERRIES    </h3>    <p>      Elderberries are easy to freeze for use in pies throughout      the year. Just stem and wash the berries, scald them in      boiling water for one minute, cool them in ice water and      drain off the liquid. Cover the fruit with a syrup, made      with three cups of sugar to four cups of water, and pack      and freeze the sweetened mixture (see the frozen food      section of any good cookbook for full processing      directions).    </p>      <h3>        ELDERBERRY DUMPLINGS      </h3>      <p>        <strong>BERRY MIXTURE</strong>      </p>      <p>        2 cups berries<br />        3/4 cup sugar<br />        1 Tbs, flour<br />        2 Tbs. lemon juice<br />        3/4 cup water<br />      </p>      <p>        Combine all the ingredients, heat them gently and keep        them warm while you make the dumplings.<br />      </p>      <p>        <strong>DUMPLING MIXTURE</strong><br />      </p>      <p>        3/4 cup flour, sifted<br />        11/2 tsp. baking powder<br />        1/2 tsp. cinnamon<br />        1/2 tsp. salt<br />        1/4 cup sugar<br />        1/4 cup lemon peel, grated<br />        1/4 cup milk<br />        1 egg      </p>    <p>      Add the other dry ingredients to the sifted and measured      flour. Mix the milk and the egg in a small bowl and stir      them into the flour combination until the dough is just      blended. Now pour the hot berry mixture into a casserole      and drop in small spoonfuls of the dumpling batter. Bake      the dish at 400OF for 25 to 30 minutes until the pastry      balls are lightly browned. Serve the dessert warm with      cream or vanilla ice cream.<br />    </p>    <p>      Of course, no collection of berry recipes would be complete      without a pie. Let's call this one ...<br />    </p>      <h3>        GRANDMOTHER'S FAVORITE ELDERBERRY PIE      </h3>      <p>        Use whatever method you prefer to make pastry for a        double-crust pie. Line a nine-inch pie tin with dough and        reserve the top crust. Then, in a large bowl, mix:<br />      </p>      <p>        3 1/2 cups elderberries<br />        1 cup sugar (more if you have a sweet tooth)<br />        1/4 tsp. salt<br />        2 Tbs. cornstarch or tapioca<br />        1 Tbs. lemon juice<br />        1 Tbs. butter      </p>    <p>      Mix the ingredients and pour them into the pie shell. Top      the creation with the reserved upper crust and cut vents in      the lid to let the steam escape. Bake the pie in a 400OF      oven for 40 to 45 minutes and serve it warm or cold with      cream or vanilla ice cream.    </p>    <p>      Another neat pie trick is to add about one cup of      elderberries to your favorite apple filling for bright      color and a fresh tang. <em>(Not everyone enjoys the      characteristic taste of this fruit "as is", however, and      some foragers prefer to dry the berries before popping them      into the pastry or using them for other purposes.      -MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      And here, for lovers of fine wine, is a recipe for a      beverage made from elderberry flowers.<br />    </p>      <h3>        ELDERBERRY WINE      </h3>      <p>        1 quart firmly packed blossoms, separated from the        stems<br />        3 gallons water<br />        9 pounds sugar<br />        3 pounds seedless raisins, chopped<br />        1/2 cup strained lemon juice (about 4 lemons)<br />        1 cake compressed yeast      </p>    <p>      Combine the sugar and the water and boil them about five      minutes to make a thin syrup. Pour in the blossoms and mix      them well. Then cool the liquid to lukewarm and add the      raisins, lemon juice and yeast. Put the mixture into a      large crock and let it stand for six days, stirring three      times daily. Then strain the wine and put it aside to age      for several months. Finally, pour the liquid into bottles      or fruit jars and cap the containers. The result is a      light, delicate drink.    </p>
