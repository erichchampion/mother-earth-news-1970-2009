        	        <h5 id="byline">      by HAROLD F. BLAISDELL    </h5>    <p>      Crows are usually thought of as the traditional enemies of      corngrowing farmers, but I recently discovered that      grackles-the so-called "boat-tail" variety-are      even worse villains in this respect. There are more of      them, for one thing . . . and they're even bolder, for      another.    </p>    <p>      Grackles follow the same devastating routine as that      employed by crows. As soon as the tiny corn plants push      above ground, the thieves waddle up one row and down the      next, pulling the seedlings in meticulous succession and      gobbling the kernels from which they sprouted. The first      shoot-eating scoundrel quickly attracts others, and the all      out gathering of the clan which swiftly follows can lay      waste an entire planting in a very short time.    </p>    <p>      To me, the habits of crop-stealing birds are more than just      natural history . . . they're a serious economic problem.      You see, my wife and I live on a five-acre tract, in a home      which we built largely by our own efforts. Much of our land      is unfit for crops and on this acreage we set out 3,000 red      pine and spruce seedlings, some of which are now 20 feet      tall. I'm bringing the remainder of the property under      cultivation as rapidly as possible, raising all the      vegetables and berries needed for family use and selling      the steadily increasing surplus at retail.    </p>    <p>      In line with my market gardening program, I plowed an      additional quarter-acre this spring . . . land which had      lain neglected for at least two decades. I cleared the plot      as thoroughly as possible, but the turf remained so densely      matted with the roots of trees, bushes, weeds and grass      that only a very rough job of plowing and harrowing could      be done. Nevertheless, I planted the entire patch in seven      kinds of sweet corn and gambled that I'd be able to keep      down the unwanted growth with my rototiller.    </p>    <p>      The planting totalled 40 rows, 40 hills to the row. This      <em>should</em> mean 1,600 hills, three stalks to the hill      and a yield of nearly 5,000 ears. I sold all the sweet corn      I could grow last summer, about 1,000 ears, at 85 cents per      dozen. With prices likely to be higher this year, I      could-by pipe-dream reasoning-expect to gross      as much as $400 from the planting.    </p>    <p>      But even if I had been inclined to indulge this tempting      line of wishful thinking (and I wasn't that silly!), the      cussed grackles would have set me straight in a hurry. They      descended en masse and began pulling the corn shoots as      fast as their green tips reached the light of day.    </p>    <p>      What to do? I had read about controlling birds with the      timed explosions of carbide cannons. Even if my pocketbook      could have stood the cost, however, the damage would have      been complete before the devices could have been obtained      and installed.    </p>    <p>      Shoot the buggers? Our lot lies in the midst of an      otherwise thickly populated area, and my first conclusion      was that shooting would be too dangerous. Then I remembered      the mention of .22-caliber <em>shot shells</em> by a      neighbor who claimed to have saved his berry crop from      birds by annihilating the robbers with this rather exotic      ammunition.<br />      <br />      The shells that fellow used are made to be fired in .22      rifles which normally shoot solid bullets and are      conceivably dangerous for more than a mile. The substitute      ammunition, however, is loaded with a small charge of shot      so fine that it's hardly more than dust. The pellets are      lethal to small birds only at ranges of ten yards or less      and virtually harmless to everything (living or otherwise)      at greater distances.    </p>    <p>      To my surprise, the nearest sporting goods store stocked      the specialized loads. I bought a box and marched off to      war.    </p>    <p>      Luckily (at least from my standpoint), the hundreds of      grackles which were asserting squatter's rights on our      property had no fear of me at first. I zapped three in      swift succession, at point-blank range.    </p>    <p>      But grackles, like their crow cousins, are no dummies.      Stalking rapidly grew more and more difficult. By the time      I had run my total to eight-no mean feat-no      grackle would let me approach within howitzer range. This      was fine with me, and gave me another idea.    </p>    <p>      I figured that if I built a scarecrow and draped it with      the clothes I had been wearing while doing the shooting,      the grackles might shun the impostor as completely as they      had learned to avoid me. My ensemble, after all, was hardly      better than that seen on most scarecrows . . . so its      consignment to the cause would represent no great      sacrifice.    </p>    <p>      Accordingly, I nailed together two narrow boards of      appropriate lengths to form a cross-shaped framework and      planted this support firmly in the ground in the middle of      the corn patch. Next, I stuffed a corner of an old      pillowcase with hay and tacked the ball in place as a head.      Then I rigged the frame with the clothes I had been      wearing.    </p>    <p>      When I had finished stuffing the ragged pants and shirt      with the hay and had pinned my old hat to the "head", the      damned thing looked altogether <em>too</em> much like me to      suit my taste. The dummy incorporated all      less-than-flattering details down to and including my pot      gut. Neighbors promptly began attesting to the likeness by      waving as they drove by.    </p>    <p>      Although the unmistakable resemblance has cost me something      in terms of vanity, the in-my-image scarecrow has paid off      handsomely by putting the fear of death into the grackles.      To the best of my knowledge, not one has dared alight in      the cornfield since the straw guard's construction, and the      nowunmolested corn has rapidly outgrown its vulnerability      as far as birds are concerned.    </p>    <p>      Just to keep the game dishonest, though, I take a daily      turn around the patch with my rifle under my arm. I never      get to within range of a grackle, but I make it a point to      fire a round or two into the tree tops to show them that      I'm still on the qui vive.    </p>    <p>      If you're troubled with feathered robbers, the same frontal      attack-followed by deception-should work as      well for you as it has for me. And if you build a scarecrow      in your own image, I'm sure that your effigy won't look as      downright disreputable as mine.    </p>    		<div class="sidebar">    <p>      <strong>So the crows and other feathered robbers made off      with half your corn crop this spring before the plants had      hardly even poked their little green heads out of the      ground. Makes you wanna run out with grandpa's blunderbuss      and have at the rascals, doesn't it? Or at the very least      set up a scarecrow . . . except for the rumors you've heard      about modern, sophisticated birds and their refusal to be      frightened by such traditional devices.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Well, it's too late to be of much help this year,      but <em>next</em> time around you might want to combine      both those impulses the way Harold Blaisdell does . . . by      building yourself a scarecrow with some real      authority.</strong>    </p>    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/022-086-01.jpg" alt="022-086-01.jpg" width="220" height="242" />    </div>		</div>
