        An ideal double nesting box for pigeons. Note the landing platform<br />between the two nests. Each pair of pigeons should be supplied with one<br />of these double nests and each nest should be at least 2 feet square.<br />Solid floors should be provided and ample short straw available so that<br />the birds may construct their own laying nests.
