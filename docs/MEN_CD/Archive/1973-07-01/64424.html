                    <p>      The crew that puts together LIFESTYLE! and THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS was given a special holiday present last fall: In      addition to its usual average of about 56 hours of work a      week, it was presented with the chore of nailing together      (in its spare time) a 384-page paperback book for Bantam.    </p>    <p>      September, October, November, December and the first few      days of January-in other words-were pretty      brutal for some of the folks around here . . . and I'm      afraid they didn't have much of a Thanksgiving, Christmas      or New Year's celebration at all.    </p>    <p>      Why did they do it . . . why did nearly a dozen individuals      work themselves (for very little more than minimum wage)      until they were so exhausted that-at one time or      another-they all actually became physically sick?      Because they're damn good people who want to get THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS Research Center built for the (we hope)      subsequent benefit of the planet and <em>all</em> of us.      They knew that, by putting together a book that Bantam      could mass-market, they'd be helping to spread MOTHER's      word just a little further and-if all goes      well-putting a few more dollars into the Research      Center fund. I'm dang proud of 'em all.    </p>    <p>      And the book? Oh yes, the book. It's called THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS ALMANAC and it sells for $1.95 and it's packed      with tables and formulas and recipes and tips and hints and      weather lore and wild food ideas and organic gardening      information and land-finding methods and recycling projects      and alternative power concepts and all kinds of things. A      few (actually a very, very few) of the book's subjects are      shown on these two pages just to give you the tiniest idea      of the wealth of knowledge crammed into the paperback . . .      all written and illustrated just for the book.    </p>    <p>      Look for THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> ALMANAC wherever paperbacks      are sold . . . or order out a copy direct from MOTHER's      bookshelf. The money, as they say, is going for a good      cause . . . and I betcha you'll like the book      too!-JS.    </p>    <p>      To peel a turnip or other tough-skinned vegetable, score      the rind in bands all the way around (like the Tropics of      Capricorn and Cancer on the globe) and cut the strips off      one at a time.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      The next time the tips comes off one of your shoulders, dig      the unprotected end of string in melted paraffin and shape      before the wax hardens.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      It's easy to sweep up the big pieces of glass when a bottle      or tumbler is broken on the kitchen floor . . . and just as      easy overlook the smaller slivers until they wind up in      someone's fingers or bare feet. You can quickly collect      those small she before they do any damage, however, by      patting them up piece of absorbent cotton that has been      moistened in water.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Put a small dish of water into the oven when when you bake      bread and you'll find that it helps to keep the crust of      the loaves from getting too hard.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Fruit jar rubbers sewed on each corner of a small rug will      prevent the floor covering from slipping underfoot.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      To get more juice out of an orange or lemon, roll the fruit      firmly on a hard surface before you squeeze it.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      A couple of tin cans in the middle of the fireplace will      absorb heat and radiate a surprising amount into the room.      Replace them every three or four days.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      The shelf life of home-canned food can be increased by      packing the jars in sawdust or hay to insulate them from      extreme heat or cold.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Here's an old recipe for a pleasant-smelling mixture to be      stored with linens: Dry rose leaves in the shade and mix a      pound of them with one ounce each of cloves, caraway seeds      and allspice. Pound the leaves and spices together in a      mortar or grind them in a mill. Add a quarter pound of dry      salt, mix well and put the scent in muslin bags.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      If swallows fly high, expect fair weather, but if they stay      near the ground, look out for rain.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      To prevent mice from gnawing the bark of young apple trees      in winter, the early American settlers used to pack snow      very firmly around the base of the tree.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      For what it's worth: The mosquito is attracted more to wet      clothing than to dry, and is especially fond of the color      blue.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      By placing a damp cloth over a dent in wooden furniture and      then applying a hot iron for a few minutes, you can often      make the wood fibers spring back into place.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      If your cat nibbles the leaves off your house plants, sow      birdseed in a shallow pot and give him his own private      supply of greens.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      Add a few "red hots" or cinnamon candy drops as you cook up      your next batch of homemade apple butter, and the spread      will have both a better flavor and color.    </p>          <p>      Loop the cord from a portable power tool together<br /> with the      extension cord it plugs into as shown here<br /> and you'll save      yourself the aggravation of pulling<br /> the two lines apart      every time you move around <br />the project on which you're      working.    </p>        <p>      You can build a pretty good root cellar <em>above</em><br />      ground if you construct it with double walls and a<br /> double      roof. Set the posts for the inner walls,<br /> then-two      feet farther out in all directions-the <br />uprights for      the outer walls. Board up the <br />enclosure within an enclosure      and stuff the space<br /> between with dry leaves or straw. If      you use sawdust or ground corncobs for insulation, you can      cut the width of the space all the way around<br /> to only one      foot.    </p>    <p>      For the roof of your storage shed, build a double set of      rafters designed so that the gap between the inner and      outer beams is the same as the space between the walls. Lay      boardson the lower rafters, stack on the leaves, straw,      sawdust or whatever . . . and add the second set of      supports and a roof.    </p>    <p>      It's best to design two doors for the entrance to your      aboveground root cellar . . . with the outer one built      double and filled with six inches of sawdust.    </p>        <p>      Construct the vegetable storage shed's floor a foot off the      ground of either logs or boards spaced so that there are      cracks between them. The narrow gaps will provide some air      circulation and heat from the earth below . . . and dirt      carried in on root vegetables will conveniently sift      through the cracks and out of the way.    </p>        <p>      Set a livestock feed or water bucket in the center of<br /> an      old automobile tire and the animal or animals<br /> won't be able      to overturn the container.    </p>        <p>      Cut and sharpen a "V" notch into one side of<br /> your garden      hoe and you'll find it much easier to <br />nip off those tough      weeds that seem to delight<br /> in growing in tight corners. The      V won't slip off as<br /> you bear down on a particular weed and      the edges of the notch-protected as they are from<br />      constantly chopping into the ground-will stay<br /> sharp      an uncommonly long time.    </p>        <p>      Your crash course in subsistence farming is not complete      until you can pronounce "silage" (sigh'-lij) correctly and      know what it is. Silage is grass, or grain plants cut and      chopped green and stored in a silo and the crop most      successfully made into silage is corn. When the ear reaches      the "dent" state, the whole plant is cut, chopped and blown      into the silo . . . where it turns brownish and ferments      into a feed cows love.    </p>    <p>      Air spoils silage quickly and must be kept out of the      chopped feed. The least expensive way to store the food is      in a trench silo, which is nothing but a basement-sized      hollow scooped out of the ground. The silage is dumped in,      tightly packed by running heavy-tired machinery over it and      covered with plastic film. The forage is also packed      tightly enough to exclude most air when it's stored in the      old wooden upright silos, and the newest vertical silos are      coated inside with glass or plastic to make them airtight.    </p>    <p>      Corn silage is a good cheap feed for subsistence farmers.      if you have just a few livestock, though, it won't pay you      to get all the equipment necessary to make silage (to say      nothing of the silo). You can, however, store a small      supply of the forage by piling it on the ground, covering      it with plastic filet and burying the edges of the film in      the ground. Ancient, stationary silage choppers can be      acquired for a song in dairy country, and most of them will      still work if the blades are sharpened. You can cut and tie      green corn into bundles and haul them to the chopper.    </p>    <p>      You c an also avail yourself of farmers who have a custom      service of chopping silage and filling silos for others.    </p>    <p>      if 1 had just one or two cows or goats to feed year 'round,      I'd chop up all the stalks from the garden sweet corn patch      (right after roasting ear season) with my rotary mower . .      . and put the shredded plants into plastic bags.
