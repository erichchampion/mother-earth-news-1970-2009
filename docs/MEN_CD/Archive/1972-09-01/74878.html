                    <h5 id="byline">      By James E. Churchill    </h5>    <p>      The pads of the pond lily float like green fairy rafts      almost everywhere in the world that there's calm, placid      water. That's a mighty handy fact to know, too, because the      plant will furnish good, flavorful food for the forager      from the time it emerges in the spring until it disappears      under the ice in winter. If you can find the huge, spongy      roots of this wild vegetable during zero weather, it'll      even provide a satisfying meal then.<br />      <br />      The white pond lily <em>(Nymphaea odorata)</em> and yellow      pond lily <em>(Nuphar variegatum)</em> have pads that may      be a foot in diameter. Large cells in the huge, ribbed      leaves make the foliage spongy and buoyant enough to float      on the water's surface. This foliage is both tender and      tasty when properly prepared.<br />      <br />      The stems beneath the lily pads are thick and the roots      look like something you'd see sticking out of a foraging      dinosaur's mouth. They can be six feet long, the size of a      man's wrist and covered with a brown skin and "eyes". These      eyes are the sprouting points for the plant's flower stems      and leaf stalks. The stalks grow from the semicircular      scars and the flower stems later develop on the      stalks.<br />      <br />      I harvest the leaves by wading out into a patch and pulling      them loose, stalk and all. When I've gathered a half dozen      of the large pads and stems I take 'em home and wash them      very well. This cleansing is necessary since the plant is a      favorite resting place for a considerable variety of      insects and reptiles. Once the leaves are washed I cut them      into pieces with a sharp knife and use them for pond lily      soup, September stew (acorn, squirrel and pond lily      fritters) . . . and, naturally, for greens. There's nothing      wrong with pond lily leaves raw either, especially when      you're munching the first tender pads of spring.<br />    </p>        <p>      Pond lily leaves gathered anytime during the growing season      (although, again, early spring growth is best of all) make      good greens. Simply chop the pads into noodle-like strips      and boil them in one change of water. The addition of a      little bacon doesn't hurt a thing.<br />      <br />      Steaming works very well with pond lily leaves too, and is      usually the way we prepare this part of the vegetable.      Older, tougher pads may require 20 minutes of the treatment      before they're "just right" and ready to eat with a pat of      butter and seasoning.<br />      <br />      For a change of pace with these greens, we also like to      cover a cup of chopped wild or domestic onion and two cups      of chopped pond lily leaves with water and simmer them for      twenty minutes. During the last five minutes we add a pat      of butter and some whole grain bread crumbs. When you      remove, drain and serve this dish, you can drink the juice      or use it for pond lily soup. Backpackers will find that      any of the freezedried onion mixes will work as well as      boiled raw onions in this recipe, and everyone who tries      the dish will soon discover that pond lilies get tougher      and require longer cooking as the season progresses.<br />      <br />      Pond lily soup will brighten any fall day. Start a      kettleful by simmering a pound of deer or moose leg bone      for an hour or until it starts to get tender. At that      point, drop in a good-sized chunk of bacon to simmer along      for about another hour. When all the meat is tender, remove      it from the fire, cool and chop into inch-thick cubes. Put      the chopped meat back in the liquid, slice a double handful      of pond lily leaves and any other vegetable you might have      and drop them into the stock. Cook until the leaves are      tender, then season very well and serve piping hot.<br />      <br />      Now it happens in September or October that all the      ingredients for pond lily fritters are just waiting to be      used by the food forager. The first ingredient and probably      the hardest to find is squirrel meat. This isn't to imply      that there aren't plenty of squirrels . . . it simply means      that securing one is harder than picking a plant. A most      sporting and timehonored way to do the job is by hiding      very early in the morning in an oak or hickory thicket and      waiting quietly until one shows up for harvest with a      well-placed .22 bullet. Many folks (like me) who aren't      sure of their aim use a shotgun while others (the real      experts) gather bushytails with a slingshot or bow and      arrow.<br />      <br />      If it happens that you don't have a gun or other weapon and      still want to catch a squirrel, there are other ways. One      of the fastest is to take a pocketful of rocks and throw      them at a squirrel in a tree until you either very luckily      hit and stun him or - more likely - he gets      scared and scampers into a hole.<br />      <br />      If the hole is too hard to get close to, keep searching out      squirrels until you have one in a hollow that you can get      to. Then find a piece of barbed wire about four feet long      and thread it into the opening until you touch the little      varmint. When you feel the wire make contact, bend a handle      on your end and twist until you have the squirrel's tail      wrapped up. Then pull him out and dispatch him.<br />      <br />      Now I know from experience that an army of animal "lovers"      and misinformed conservationists are going to arise and      smite me for mentioning this. Please remember, though      - before you write - that I'm only trying to      help homesteaders who honestly are endeavoring to forage      food and need whatever help they can get.<br />      <br />      When you have the squirrel, clean him by the method      mentioned in an earlier issue of MOTHER . . . that is chop      off the head, feet and tail and cut a slit across the skin      in the middle of the back. Insert your forefingers in the      slit and pull the halves of the hide away from each other      and off the body. Then cut a slit from between the hind      legs to between the front legs and pull out the intestines      and organs. Cut the meat into quarters, wash or wipe off      the blood and cool the chunks in the refrigerator or in      cold water.<br />      <br />      The acorn part of the stew can be picked up under oak trees      almost anywhere in the world except the far north.      Remember, however, that acorns have to be shelled, ground      and boiled in at least three changes of water to make them      sweet (see MOTHER NO. 3).<br />      <br />      When you have acorns ground into flour, mix 1-1/4 cups of      the meal with one teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon      salt and add enough water to make a sticky dough. Then      divide the quarters of squirrel in half, salt and pepper      the pieces and roll them in the acorn dough. Finally, take      large pieces of pond lily leaf, parboil them in salted      water for at least ten minutes and roll the batter-coated      squirrel meat in individual wrappings of leaves. Place in a      350-degree oven for about one hour or until the meat is      tender.<br />      <br />      The leaf of the pond lily isn't the only part of the water      vegetable that's good. The unopened buds - which are      best before the flower starts to show - and the roots      can be eaten also.<br />      <br />      I enjoy the buds boiled a few minutes in salted water or      steamed and served with melted butter or yogurt.<br />      <br />      The flower buds can also be pickled. Pick and wash about a      quart of the unopened blossoms and pack them into a mason      jar. Heat to boiling a mixture of one cup apple cider      vinegar, 1/4 cup salt and 1/2 teaspoon alum. Pour the      solution over the buds, add water to fill the jars, throw      in a pinch of dill if you have it and add a red pepper or      two. Seal and let stand for about two months.<br />      <br />      Pond lily buds, flowers and leaves can be wilted in      vegetable oil or bacon grease also. Just cut them into      bite-sized pieces and stir 'em around in hot grease until      they're well-coated and turning brown at the edges.<br />      <br />      As huge and abundant as lily leaves are, the underwater      portion of the plant probably outdoes them in sheer mass.      As mentioned before, the roots and stems are huge and long      with a skin that looks like something left over from      prehistoric times. When pulled up by storms, ice, beavers      or muskrats they'll often float around until they finally      lodge and start a new colony. Loose, floating pond lily      roots <em>can</em> be used for food . . . but sometimes      they're soft and half rotten so I always pull my own. A      turtle hook works very well for this and, occasionally, the      long tentacles come up as a bonus when I'm gathering lily      leaves and stalks.<br />      <br />      Now the interior of the pond lily's root is soft and      spongy, but very clean and white. In fact it looks like      it'd be good enough to eat as soon as it's peeled. Not so.      Sections of the water vegetable's underpinnings do have to      be peeled, of course . . . but even then- they're too      bitter to eat.<br />      <br />      Accordingly, the way to prepare a pond lily root is to,      first, pull it up (easy) and, second, peel it (somewhat      difficult due to its spongy and tough nature). I use a very      sharp knife and still have to saw a bit to get the brown      skin and the "eyes" shucked away.<br />      <br />      When I'm down to white root, I cut it into thick slices and      boil the pieces in several changes of water until the pulp      loses its acrid taste. Adding vinegar to the water also      helps neutralize the bitterness and prepare the sections of      root for baking, french frying or floating in soup.<br />      <br />      Baked pond lily root is made by half filling a medium-sized      baking dish with the processed slices. Add a large double      pat of butter. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and add 3/4      cup of water in which a potato has been boiled and mashed.      Cover with parboiled pond lily leaves and bake at 375      degrees for about 25 minutes.<br />      <br />      When I get tired of eating pond lily roots I'll probably      look for some nettles before the frost has laid them low,      because the common stinging nettle is one of the best      plants to bring inside for "forcing" in the basement.<br />      <br />      A nettle root is forced or grown inside by placing it in      moist sand in the basement . . . and just waiting for it to      send up its white stalk. This young shoot and its leaves      are both very good and very nutritious . . . they can be      eaten raw or cooked into any vegetable or meat stew that      you might happen to be making. First, however, before we      can plant it we must dig the root.<br />      <br />      I try to spot this wild vegetable - which usually      grows in a colony - after a fall rain. When I find      one I cut the stalk off and dig up the good-sized root,      surrounding dirt and all. The more soil that can be left on      the underground portion of the plant, the sooner it'll      start to grow in the basement. Figure on about a dozen of      these starts for each person you intend to feed over the      winter.<br />      <br />      The nettle sprouts are pinched off when they're about four      to six inches long and then are boiled for just a few      minutes and served with a pat of butter . . . or they can      be used in any good fall soup. We like to add one cup of      the chopped shoots to two cups of beef stock, simmer for 20      minutes, add salt and pepper and eat hot with whole grain      toast.<br />      <br />      Planting the roots in boxes of sand in the basement, of      course, is only one of many uses of the nettle. Early in      the spring the young plants are very good greens and are      packed with almost unbelievable amounts of vitamin C and      vitamin A.<br />      <br />      Now as most country people know, the nettle does possess      sharp venom-tipped thorns that will raise welts on your      skin at the slightest touch. The venom affects livestock      also and it's very seldom that animals will eat green      nettles. After it's cut and dried in hay, however, the      plant makes very good fodder . . . and cooking changes the      caustic acid in nettles into nourishing people food.<br />      <br />      We pick nettle greens with gloves on and wash the spiny      leaves by stirring them in a pan of cold water with a      long-handled spoon (so we don't get stung by the venom). It      sometimes takes a change of water to clean off all the      clinging dust and insects. When the nettles are washed we      drop them into a saucepan that has a closefitting lid, and      boil them for two or three minutes in about 1/4 inch of      water. They make their own juice so, if the fire isn't too      hot, only a very little water is needed. When the greens      are cooked, we serve them with a pat of butter and drink      all the juice that's left when we drain them.<br />      <br />      Nettle is also good when cooked with other greens -      such as sour dock <em>(Rumex crispus</em> ) - to give      a variety of flavors. The good thing about using these two      in combination is that the juice from sour dock seems to      have a beneficial effect when rubbed on the welts that will      surely develop if you accidently touch the nettles. Of      course the caustic acid that generates the swelling will be      neutralized in a few minutes by the body anyway . . . so      sooner or later - sour dock or no - the welts      are bound to disappear.<br />      <br />      Another dish that can be made with young spring nettles or      the shoots forced in your basement is nettle pudding. Wash,      chop and cook one heaping cup of nettle greens. Add one      large, chopped onion or a half cup of wild onions. Process      a cup of milkweed flower buds by boiling them in two      changes of water for one minute each time. Add the buds to      the nettle mixture. Then for flavor and body mix together      1-1/2 cups of ground deer meat (hamburger will do) and      three slices of diced bacon and add to the pudding fixin's.      Season with 1/8 teaspoon of salt and a good sprinkling of      sage. Tie the mixture into a clean, white cloth and boil      for about an hour in a large kettle. Serve with milk gravy      or butter.<br />      <br />      The nettle has other uses too. Fibers from the plant can be      made into one of the finest cloths. Also, it's a wonderful      herb for curing scurvy and vitamin A deficiency. The      ancient herbalists used nettles as a remedy for rheumatism,      poisoning. from other plants and a long list of assorted      ills. The good old nettle, then, deserves recognition for      things other than just the skin rash it produces on unwary      folks. Paradoxically, a plant that has a well-known flavor      but is almost unknown itself is wintergreen.<br />      <br />      Wintergreen <em>(Gaultheria procumbens),</em> checkerberry,      teaberry, mountainberry and partridgeberry are all local      names for small, shrubby, recumbent plant that sends up      little, hear shaped green leaves and a fruiting sprig from      a slender stem that creeps among - sometimes under      and sometimes on top of the leaves. Later in the year the      sprig will bear bright red berries. All of the plant      - the leaves, the twigs, and the fruit -      contains wintergreen oil . . . the flavoring that's used in      candy, toothpaste, food and a host of other products. By      some strange quirk of nature this is the same oil that's      contained in the huge black birch <em>(Betula lenta)</em>      tree that was described in an earlier issue of      MOTHER.<br />      <br />      One of the chief uses of wintergreen is the tea made from      the plant. We brew ours by picking the leaves after they've      turned red and then drying them . . . September and October      is a good time for this. When they've cured we grind a      quart of the leaves and place them in a jar. Then we cover      the powder with a quart of boiling water, seal the      container and let it stand in the warm house for two days.      The longer it sets the stronger the tea, and the redder the      leaves the pinker the liquid will be.<br />      <br />      This tea can be drunk warm or cool but if we heat it we're      very careful not to boil the solution since that seems to      make it lose most, if not all of its flavor. Most people      like to strain the "grounds" out but I find I like the      taste enough to swallow them along with the liquid. Nothing      . . . but nothing cures a headache for me as fast as a      good, warm cup of wintergreen tea, swallowed grounds and      all. Wintergreen tea is also very refreshing and warming to      the body.<br />      <br />      A pink wine can be made from this tea by stirring four      pounds of honey into three gallons of the strained brew in      a stone crock. Add a cake of yeast and let the tea ferment      for about two weeks under a cloth. When it quits bubbling,      siphon the liquid off into bottles. Cap the containers      tightly and let the concoction age for about a month . . .      longer if you have the patience. Chill and serve.<br />      <br />      Wintergreen berries have a very delightful, cool taste that      goes really well in flavored gelatin or eaten in a      delicious yogurt.<br />      <br />      This yogurt is made by substituting wintergreen tea for the      water that would normally be used to dissolve the powdered      milk. It's well to add a teaspoonful of liquified gelatin      to each cup of the yogurt mix also. Otherwise, proceed as      usual, slip in a little honey or other sweetener if you      desire and eat the dish as a snack or dessert.<br />    </p>    <p>      Another plant that makes a fine dessert is the ground      cherry <em>(Physalis pubescens).</em> The ground cherry is      a sprawling plant that usually doesn't get over eight      inches high. It's almost indistinguishable from a multitude      of other weeds until late summer or fall when it bears its      fruit in a Chinese lantern type of husk. This husk is      almost always straw-colored and is very often found growing      in bunches. Eaten alone, ground cherries are a little too      sweet for me to enjoy so I combine them with hazelnuts for      a raw dessert that'll make almost anyone smack their      lips.<br />      <br />      Pick, husk and wash about a quart of ground cherries. Set      the blender at its lowest speed, drop the cherries in and      chop them for a few seconds. Remove and replace with a pint      of hazelnut meats that you've picked and shelled. Chop the      nuts in the blender for a few seconds, mix them with the      chopped cherries, add chilled milk, a very little cinnamon      and stir very well. Place the mixture back in the      refrigerator, chill and serve very cool. That's good      eatin'.    </p>
