                <p>      <strong>DEAR MOM,</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIVINE INSPIRATION HITS US ALL ONE TIME OR OTHER.      MINE CAME AFTER TOTING 100 POUNDS OF FOOD UPHILL TO OUR      CABIN. I WAS FIGHTING OFF EXHAUSTION WITH THE THOUGHT OF      HOT APPLE PIE WE'D HAVE FOR SUPPER, BUT AT THE TOP, MY LADY      INFORMED ME YOU CAN'T BAKE PIES ON A WOODSTOVE WITHOUT      CHOPPING DOWN A HALF ACRE OF GOD'S OWN TREES FOR FUEL. MY      DEPRESSION WAS HEWMONGUS , AND I SHUFFLED DOWN HILL FOR A      SECOND LOAD. THEN THE GREAT SPIRIT CAME TO THE RESCUE,      SAYING "COUNTRY PIE FREAK, DESPAIR NOT, BUT SLICE AND      PARBOIL YOUR SOFTEST APPLES AND ADD BROWN SUGAR AND      CINNAMON IN THE RIGHTEOUS FASHION... THEN MAKE LIGHT BROWN      TOAST... SLICE UP STRIPS OF GOODLY CHEESE, LAY THEM AROUND      THE PERIMETERS OF THE TOAST, DUMP YOUR APPLE MIX IN THE      CENTER AND CAP WITH ANOTHER TOAST... THEN FRY IN A BUTTRED      SKILLET TILL THE CHEESE MELTS AND BECOMES A      SEALER...</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEHOLD... HOT PIE SANDWICH !"</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BACK AT THE HILLTOP, I RELATED THE VISION TO MY LADY WHO      FORTHWITH MADE IT REALITY. WE WERE FULFILLED!</strong>    </p>
