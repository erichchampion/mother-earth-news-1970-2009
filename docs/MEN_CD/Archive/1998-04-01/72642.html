            		<p>			<strong>LAST LAUGH</strong>    </p>            <p>      Marv, who runs a trailer Park on the shores of Lake      Michigan, can do just about anything with his front-loader,      including gardening. His skill with heavy equipment dates      back to service in World War II, when he and his fellow      Sea-bees would follow our invading armed forces, and, with      the help of bulldozers, plywood, and baling wire, would      construct an airstrip, complete with control tower, within      an hour of landing. In the old debate about form vs.      function - for Marv - function wins every time.      If a six-foot-diameter cable spool looks like a table, it      is plumped down on the beach for the convenience of      overnight campers. If tree trunks or stumps catch blowing      sand and stabilize the beach, they are promptly added to      our seascape. Viewed from the water, half a mile out, the      beach has a certain derelict, abandoned-island charm.    </p>    <p>      Anyhow, Marv's best friend Poppa was busy spading-up an      unused corner of the grounds for a vegetable garden when      Marv rumbled over in the front-loader.    </p>    <p>      "Where you been?" Poppa asked.    </p>    <p>      "Down to the beach. Those wise-guy kids on their ATVs have      been roaring along the shoreline, making a pest of      themselves again."    </p>    <p>      "Did you talk to them?"    </p>    <p>      "Naw, I just raised a hill of sand from the lake to the      bluff: Trapped them on the other side. What're you trying      to do?"    </p>    <p>      "Start a garden patch."    </p>    <p>      "Well, shoot, I'll fix you up in no time." So Marv lowered      his bucket and scraped the plot clean, shaving three inches      below the surface. The newly scalped landscape, being near      the lake, was, as you might imagine, very sandy.    </p>    <p>      "Looks pretty sandy," Poppa allowed, as he stared at the      thirty by forty foot garden-to-be. "Needs some body."    </p>    <p>      "How about turkey doo?" Marv replied. "My son just got a      whole truckload of turkey droppings that they used to grow      mushrooms in. I can spread a layer of that stuff over your      patch and you won't have to dig or nothin'."    </p>    <p>      Soon, there was powerful stench coming from the vegetable      plot-to-be as Marv trundled back and forth with the front      loader maw dribbling black, smelly compost. The thought      crossed his mind to scoop up a load, fill it with petunias      and park the machine next to the trailer park entrance. It      would have been no worse than some bathtub-planters he had      seen. Naw, he decided, he needed the machine for other      things.    </p>    <p>      "Great stuff," Marv shouted over the roar of the machine.    </p>    <p>      "Yeah. I keep thinking of the turkeys behind all this. You      know, maybe we should plant sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes      go good with turkey."    </p>    <p>      "What about fertilizer?" Marv asked.    </p>    <p>      "Probably wouldn't hurt."    </p>    <p>      "Hey, I know," Marv offered. "Fish make good fertilizer and      the beach is loaded with dead Alewives. I'll just go down      and get us a couple of loads."    </p>    <p>      Before long, the vegetable plot was knee deep in sand, fish      and fowl droppings. And it needed a fence.    </p>    <p>      "Gotta keep the deer out," Poppa said. "Let's get some      steel fence posts, a ladder, and a sledge hammer."    </p>    <p>      "Naw, I got a better idea," Marv announced calmly.    </p>    <p>      Soon the front-loader bucket was resting on top of a fence      post held upright by Poppa. Marv engaged the hydraulics to      lower the front bucket, and the post slowly sank a into the      sandy soil. After staking out the ground, Poppa eased onto      the lip of the loader bucket and rode to the utility shed      to load up rolls of old snow-fencing.    </p>    <p>      About the time Poppa and Marv began stretching fence around      the perimeter of the plot, Marv's son Heff (short for      Heffner, named after an idol from his father's salad days)      asked if he could use the front-loader to get some      evergreens from a neighbor.    </p>    <p>      "They said I could clear out the last of their Christmas      trees. We could use a nice screen along one side of the      property," Heff explained. He, it appeared, believed in      form as much as function.    </p>    <p>      Twenty minutes later, he roared by with four Christmas      trees riding in the front bucket, root-balls and all. He      downloaded the trees along the property line and took off      for more. Five trips later he had a formidable row of      evergreens waiting for final planting. First, he gouged a      shallow trench along one side of the trees. Then he went      around behind to ease them in. Mass transplanting. The      apple didn't fall far from Marv's tree.    </p>    <p>      "Got the seeds?" Marv asked as soon as the fencing was      complete.    </p>    <p>      "Yeah, I got seeds," Poppa answered. "But we got no gate to      get in," he added as they both stared at the perfectly      sealed-off garden-to-be.    </p>    <p>      "Hmmm," Marv said.    </p>    <p>      "...and even if we did have a gate, I don't want to walk      around in that stuff."    </p>    <p>      "Hmmm," Marv said as he engaged his can-do ingenuity. "Hop      on," he shouted.    </p>    <p>      Poppa stood on the lip of the bucket and Marv slowly      elevated Poppa like a circus elephant lifting a lovely      young lady in tights. Except Poppa was hanging on with two      hands as Marv carefully extended him over the fence and out      over the garden so he could cast his salad-garden seeds far      and wide. No neat rows of lettuce, carrots, and radishes      for these guys. Apparently, they decided that if this was      going to be a salad garden, it might as well grow like one:      mixed.    </p>
