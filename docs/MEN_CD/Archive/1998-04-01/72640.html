                <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>If the same old expensive cereal and doughnuts are      making your want to go back to bed, Anne Vassal can put a      healthy word in your ear.</strong>    </p>        <p>      I don't know about you, but I'm suffering from breakfast      boredom. I never could stand an egg staring me in the face      first thing in the A.M. Fresh fruit with yogurt is limited      to the summer months. I despise bananas, the winter fruit.      Bagels are good. Nope, done that. And oatmeal? Colorless      mush. So what's left? Dunkin' Donuts? No way: I'd fall into      a sugar coma. But I'm always ready for a tea treat -      something sweet yet healthy - to lure me away from my      warm, flannel-sheeted bed. That doesn't mean that I'm going      to fly out of bed to whip up a batch of cinnamon rolls. Not      being a morning person, it's a challenge just to fill the      tea kettle. So I bake a few batches of goodies on a      Saturday, plop them into Ziplock bags, and store them in      the freezer for those desperate mornings. My sweet      selection usually includes scones, muffins, sliced      quick-breads, and rolls. There's nothing like the smell of      a warm cinnamon roll and a cup of spicy, hot tea to get one      rolling off to work. I make sure to hide them in the back      of the freezer. Let the kids eat frozen waffles or      Cheerios; these treats are for grown-ups. We deserve it.    </p>    <h3>      Raspberry Scones    </h3>        <p>      Instead of using a rolling pin and biscuit cutter, these      scones are dropped onto a cookie sheet; it's much faster.      Serve warm with raspberry jam and yogurt cheese.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dry:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups sifted whole wheat pastry flour or unbleached      white flour</em><br />      <em>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, well chilled</em><br />      <em>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</em><br />      <em>2 tablespoons sugar</em><br />      <em>1/4 cup thick oats (old-fashioned, not      quick-cooking)</em><br />      <em>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</em><br />      <em>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wet:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons honey</em><br />      <em>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</em> <em>1/2 cup lowfat      buttermilk</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup frozen raspberries* (Keep them frozen until ready      to use.)</em>    </p>        <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a large cookie sheet.      Pour the flour into a food processor or use a large bowl      and pastry blender. Cut the butter into small cubes and      pulse the processor a few times until the dough looks like      bread crumbs. Pour in the wet ingredients and pulse just      until blended. Briefly pulse in the frozen berries;      over-mixing will crush them. Using an ice cream scoop,      scoop the batter onto the cookie sheet in balls at least an      inch apart. They should be about 1 1/2" in diameter and      about 1" high. Bake for 20 minutes until lightly browned.      Cool a few minutes; remove with a spatula. Must be served      warm. For defrosted freezer scones, microwave for 10      seconds.    </p>    <p>      *Note: The berries need to be frost-free - without      excess ice crystals - or else the scones will be      mushy.    </p>    <h3>      Lemon Poppy Mini-Muffins    </h3>    <p>      I love bite-size, pack portable muffins. If you don't have      a mini-muffin pan, use a regular-sized muffin pan.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 large egg</em><br />      <em>1/4 cup canola oil</em><br />      <em>1/3 cup sugar</em><br />      <em>2 tablespoons poppy seeds</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon lemon rind</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon lemon juice</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon vanilla</em><br />      <em>1 carton (8 ounces) lemon-flavored yogurt</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon baking powder</em><br />      <em>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</em><br />      <em>1 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sifted whole wheat pastry      flour* or unbleached white flour</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 375°F. My minimuffin pan is non-stick      so I don't oil it. If yours isn't non-stick, you may use      paper liners or oil the bottoms. In a large mixing bowl,      beat well the egg, oil, sugar, poppy seeds, lemon rind,      lemon juice, and vanilla. Briefly mix in the yogurt just      until blended. In a separate bowl, stir together the dry      ingredients. Add to the liquid mixture and mix slowly just      until blended. Pour the batter into the muffin pan, filling      each three-quarters full. Bake 15 minutes for mini-muffins,      20 minutes for regular muffins, until they're lightly      browned. Let cool for 10 minutes before removing them from      the pan. If you didn't use paper liners, stick a butter      knife under the edge of each muffin to loosen.    </p>    <p>      *Make sure that your pastry flour doesn't look the same as      whole wheat flour. Whole wheat flour has large flecks of      wheat bran in it. Whole wheat pastry flour is made from a      soft wheat berry that produces an off-white flour with      barely visible wheat flecks. With the exception of yeasted      bread and rolls, whole wheat flour is too heavy for baking.    </p>    <h3>      Bored with your Brew? A Cure    </h3>    <h3>      Cinnamon Coffee    </h3>    <p>      Just lay one cinnamon stick on top of the grounds and make      coffee as usual. I've tried this using an automatic Krups      drip coffee maker and a percolator. It makes your kitchen      smell wonderful.    </p>    <h3>      Spicy Tea    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 tea bags (I use Celestial Seasonings)</em> <em>2 to 3      cups water</em> <em>1 cinnamon stick</em> <em>1 strip of      orange peel</em> <em>3 slices ginger root</em> <em>3      cardamom pods, crushed slightly</em> <em>4 whole allspice      or cloves</em>    </p>    <p>      In a medium sauce pan, bring all the ingredients except tea      bags to a boil, cover, and simmer on low for about 15      minutes. Remove from heat, add tea bags, cover, steep 5      minutes. Strain and serve.    </p>    <h3>      Blueberry Coffee Cake    </h3>    <p>      This coffee cake is fast and easy. Any leftover wedges can      be frozen in baggies for a later day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cake:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1/4 cup canola oil</em> <em>1/4 cup maple syrup or      honey</em> <em>1 tablespoon sugar</em> <em>1 large egg</em>      <em>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</em> <em>1 tablespoon lemon      juice</em> <em>1 teaspoon lemon rind</em> <em>1/2 cup      lowfat buttermilk</em> <em>2 teaspoons baking powder</em>      <em>1 1/2 cup sifted whole wheat pastry flour</em> <em>1      cup blueberries, frozen</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Topping:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 tablespoon sugar (I use turbinado sugar)</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon flour</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon cinnamon</em><br />      <em>1/4 cup walnuts, finely chopped</em>    </p>        <p>      Preheat oven to 350°F Lightly grease the bottom of an      8" or 9" round cake pan. Mix the topping together in a      small bowl and set aside. Using a mixer, blend together the      oil, maple syrup or honey, and sugar until smooth. Add the      vanilla, lemon juice, lemon rind, and buttermilk and mix      well. Briefly mix in the flour and baking powder. Stir in      the frozen blueberries and pour into the cake pan. Sprinkle      on the topping evenly. Bake for 25 minutes until an      inserted toothpick comes out clean and the top is lightly      browned. Don't overbake. Cool for 10 minutes before slicing      into wedges.    </p>    <h3>      Cinnamon Rolls    </h3>    <p>      Don't let the yeast scare you; these are easy to make. Just      allow time for rising.    </p>    <p>      <em>3/4 cup skim milk</em><br />      <em>2 tablespoons honey</em><br />      <em>1 package active dry yeast</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon mild oil (canola)</em><br />      <em>1/2 teaspoon salt</em><br />      <em>1 cup unbleached white flour</em><br />      <em>1 cup whole wheat (not pastry) flour up to 1 cup white      flour for kneading</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Filling:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 teaspoons cinnamon</em><br />      <em>1/3 cup brown sugar, packed</em><br />      <em>2 tablespoons real maple syrup</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Glaze (optional):</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 tablespoon melted butter</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon maple syrup</em>    </p>    <p>      1. Lightly oil the bottom of two 8" or 9" cake pans and set      aside. In a small saucepan, warm the milk and honey until      it reaches 110°F. Since temperature is important when      working with yeast, it's best to use a cooking thermometer.      Pour the mixture into a large bowl and whisk in the yeast.      Let stand for about 10 minutes until little bubbles form on      the surface. Stir in 1 cup white flour, oil, and salt.      Cover the bowl with a dish towel and keep in a warm place,      such as inside a gas oven or on top of the stove, for 30      minutes.    </p>    <p>      2. Stir in the whole wheat flour then place the dough on a      floured board or kitchen counter, using additional white      flour to knead the dough. Knead the dough for at least 5      minutes, adding flour when it starts to get sticky. The      dough will feel smooth and elastic when you're done      kneading. Oil the bottom of the bowl. Turn the dough ball      in the bowl so the oiled side is up. Cover with a dish      towel and put in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.    </p>    <p>      3. Meanwhile, mix the filling together in a small bowl.      When the dough is almost double in size, punch it down and      roll into a large rectangle about 8"to 9" wide and about      1/4" thick; length isn't really important. Spread the      filling onto the dough up to 1/4" from the edges. It may      not spread evenly but that's OK. Beginning at the long end      of the rectangle, roll the dough up tightly using both      hands. The roll will be 8" to 9" long when completed. Using      a serrated knife, slice evenly into 8 pieces. Place the      rolls in the cake pans a half-inch apart and away from the      sides of the pans. Let them rise in a warm place for 30      minutes or until they look like plump cinnamon rolls.      Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.    </p>    <p>      4. Melt the glaze in a small saucepan and brush over the      rolls. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until lightly browned.      Overbaking will burn the bottoms and they won't be as      tender; watch carefully. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes; remove      with spatula. Eat or freeze them right in the cake pan when      cooled.    </p>    <h3>      The Ultimate portable Power-Breakfast?    </h3>    <p>      We are expected to believe many things about energy bars.      Most critical is the notion that their particular      combination of sugar, trace vitamins, and protein is an      elixir somehow deserving two to three times the price of a      Snickers bar. The second notion is that they are a suitable      meal replacement. Never ones to wallow in the backwater of      diet consciousness, many of the manufacturers listed below      have tweaked their ingredients onto the "zone" bandwagon.      Zone advocates strongly suggest that the American      infatuation with high-carbohydrate and low- or no-fat food      actually makes us fat by boosting blood insulin levels.      Their earth-shattering recommendation is that we eat a      balanced diet of roughly equivalent proportions of fat,      protein, and carbohydrates. We are still rubbing our heads      in bemusement after reading these reports, first written by      our great-grandmothers a hundred years ago. A balanced      diet...imagine that.    </p>    <p>      In any case, you can't swing a dead cat around here without      hitting someone gnawing on one of these bars, so we decided      to do a very informal taste test. At one extreme are a few      pasty, chalk-flavored unfortunates, at the other, the      almighty Snickers and Doughnut tag team: the ulti- mate      meal replacements. The F/P/C/C stands for      Fat/Protein/Carbohydrates/Calories. We asked the folks in      the office to rank each bar's flavor from 5 (heaven in a      wrapper) to 1(hell in a shrink-wrap). The score is an      average of those rankings. - Matt Scanlon    </p>
