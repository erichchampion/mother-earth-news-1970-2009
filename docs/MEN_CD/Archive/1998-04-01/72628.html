                <p>      <strong>LIVING THE DREAM</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Tina Miller    </h5>        <p>      Years ago, someone told me,"If you want it bad enough,      don't take 'No' for an answer. Every problem has a      solution... spend your energy on the solution, not the      problem." That advice has worked miracles for me.    </p>    <p>      Two years ago, coming out of a marriage that should never      have been, I was determined to take care of myself. At      forty-six, feeling very middle-aged and alone, my utmost      desire was to have a nest of my own. My dilemma was that I      had only $5,000 and no job. I wanted to live an alternative      lifestyle on the land, and I had long before made a promise      to myself that I would accomplish this without going into      debt. The promise also included a conviction that I would      never look back.    </p>    <h3>Making a Profit from Buying Land</h3>    <p>      Finding affordable land was a challenge. I needed something      I could buy - with a small down payment and low      monthly payments - that was dividable yet attractive      enough that I would want to live there the rest of my life.      I was also aware that I would have to find this humble      property and <em>then</em> turn it into my Shangrila;      really gorgeous land was far beyond my pocketbook. Watching      the land ads in the newspapers and contacting almost every      real estate agent in a hundred-mile area in southeastern      Arizona - the area I chose - was an education      in itself. I stuck to my price range and did not look at      more expensive properties, even though agents desperately      tried to push me that way.    </p>    <p>      Once I found a few candidates, I went to the planning and      zoning department of the county to find out if the land was      dividable and what, if any, restrictions applied. Do not      trust anyone's word on these matters. Go to planning and      zoning and get their recommendations <em>in writing</em> .      The process may well be Greek to you, but as long as you      make it plain that you require the kindergarten      explanation, almost everyone will be extremely helpful.      Even if you are going through real estate agents to find      your land, be prepared to do most of the legwork yourself.      They do not make large commissions on cheap land and are      not very willing to spend time, gas, and money showing it.    </p>        <p>      I found many ranchers, farmers, and large property owners      selling off forty-acre parcels, generally with 20% down and      monthly payments for ten to fifteen years at 10% interest.      Once you find your land, go through a reputable title      company and be sure to do a title search before the deal      closes. The last thing in the world you want is to be      unable to get a clear deed to a piece of land because of      title complications.    </p>    <p>      I finally located thirty-six acres here in southeastern      Arizona. The land was remote enough to provide privacy, yet      close enough - about twenty miles - to a large      town where decent jobs were a reasonable drive away. The      land was beautiful, with 360Â° views of the Mule and      Huachuca Mountains. The desert vegetation was wonderful :      ocotillo, prickly pear cactus, mesquite trees, hackberry,      black walnut trees, as well as mule deer, wild birds, and      even an occasional rattlesnake.    </p>    <p>      The trade-off for cheap, beautiful land was a very deep      water table, very nearly a thousand feet down. Electric and      phone service were not available. The lack of utility      service didn't really keep me up at night, but I own a      horse that drinks ten gallons a day! More on that in a bit.    </p>		    <p>      The land fit all of my criteria and the purchase price was      affordable: $26,500, with down payment and closing costs of      $4,000. I jumped into the deep end and bought it. The bank      financed the loan for fifteen years at 10% interest, which      put the monthly payments at $278. Of course that would not      do, so I took my last $1,000, had the land surveyed, and      split it into five parcels: three nine-acre lots and two      four-and-a-half-acre lots.    </p>    <p>      Getting a survey done was nearly as exhausting a process as      finding the land. Calling every survey company in the book      yielded five different quotes. The lowest bid was $1,500,      but there was still just $1,000 in my pocket. A little      negotiating lowered the price, and I in turn agreed to      assist in the surveying. I did all the gofer work, held      equipment, etc. Once the survey was finished and recorded,      I had the property descriptions and papers drawn up by a      reputable title company. They would be paid when the      parcels were sold. I promptly found four eager buyers for      my split parcels. I sold the two nine-acre parcels for      $12,000 each and the four-and-a-half-acre parcels for      $8,000 each. Finding the buyers was fairly easy. When I      found the whole thirty-six-acre parcel, I put the word out      immediately that I was splitting and selling off parcels. I      was also selective about whom I sold to, as I knew they      would end up being my neighbors. A couple of parcels were      sold "on time," or through what is called a land contract.      I received 20% down. They paid all the closing costs and      agreed to make monthly payments for ten years at 10%      interest. It is also fairly easy to sell with a mortgage on      these terms if you want the cash up front, but be prepared      to get less than the original selling price in the process.      Locating and purchasing the land, splitting it up, and      selling the parcels took all of about forty-five days. I      then had my nine acres paid for, my $5000 back, and a nice      $13,500 profit from the sale of my lots: seed money to      start building my home.    </p>    <p>      My salvation was my sixty-nine-year-old brother-in-law Walt      and my sister Jill, who live nearby in Bisbee, Arizona.      They believed in my venture from the beginning and      encouraged me to pursue my dream, even when it was just      that .    </p>    <h3>Mi Casa</h3>    <p>      Walt is my teacher, my mentor, my building brain, my extra      pair of hands, and my hero. While we considered the      project, he insisted upon two things from the beginning.      Numero uno was "Do it right and build to code." We have no      building codes in Cochise County, Arizona but we do have      health, zoning, and flood plain codes. Numero dos was his      stipulation that he would teach me how to do the work, not      do the work himself while I watched. Not even for a moment      did he treat me like a nincompoop, even when I asked some      howlingly dumb questions and did some mighty dumb things.    </p>    <p>      I decided on a plan for a fourteen-by-twenty-six-foot adobe      casita, designed around a passive-solar heating and cooling      floor plan, with south-facing windows and a tin roof with      two porches, to aid water collection. I initially purchased      the stabilized adobe block and mud, but adobe can also be      readily made; I have made it for other projects. All the      lumber, doors, bathroom fixtures, windows, headers, etc.,      were scrounged from local junkyards or were given to me. At      first, the process of snooping around for excess materials      made me slightly uncomfortable, but I quickly came to the      conclusion that being broke <em>and</em> shy created      mutually useless situations. I stopped at re-modeling jobs,      new construction sites, even the dump. Soon people were      bringing me more used building materials than I could use.      With a little luck, I was able to trade these extra      materials for items I needed. Enthusiasm is contagious.      Share your dream, and you'll find goodwill in the farthest      corners and the darkest spaces.    </p>    <p>      I had the foundation and the roof done by licensed      contractors. They were beyond the scope of Walt's and my      abilities, and of course turned out to be my biggest      expenses. Walt and I did rest the by ourselves, from mixing      mud and laying the adobe, to installing windows, headers,      bond beam, gas lines, plumbing etc.    </p>        <h3>Construction</h3>    <p>      First, I laid out the floor plan, with emphasis on properly      siting the windows and doors. We then built the door frame      and set it in place. Next, we put up story poles on the      corners, so the building would go up straight and plumb. We      could then begin laying the adobe block. I would mix the      mud, and wheelbarrow it to Walt. He laid most of the block.      At the two-foot level, we put in the electrical wiring on a      course of block and covered it with metal flashing. All      wood exposed to adobe was covered with metal lathe, so the      mud would stick. As the adobe reached the top of the      windows and door frames, we placed headers, using railroad      ties I purchased for $3 each at the dump. We left a foot on      either side to stabilize and tie-in the adobe walls. One      foot further we put in anchor bolts and began framing-in      for a concrete bond beam. A bond beam is a continuous pour      of concrete, tying the whole structure together. We framed      up a box ten inches high and twelve inches thick, wired it      into place, and then ran a continuous double row of rebar,      circling the entire structure. We left the foundation      anchor-bolts exposed by several inches that later allowed      us to tie-in the wood top-plate. We hired a concrete pumper      to do the pour. We removed the wood frames and then reused      them for the top-plate.    </p>    <p>      Finding carpenters to put on the roof was no easy job. I      only had $3,000 in the budget to do it, a drop in any      contractor's normal budget bucket. The quotes came in and      were several thousand dollars more than I could afford.      Just when I was ready to settle for a flat roof with no      porches, a contractor team of two brothers came to my      rescue. Mark and Mike Gruey of Bisbee, Arizona, agreed to      supply used lumber and more than honest and fair      workmanship in producing a very high grade of galvanized      tin roof. They cut their profit to help me, and in return I      have recommended them highly for other jobs. With the roof      installed, we put in the windows, Sheetrocked the ceiling,      plastered the inside walls with adobe, painted the walls      white with a lime plaster, and painted the concrete floor.      Walt and I built all the sink cupboards and closets with      used lumber we scrounged or were given.    </p>    <p>      We worked every day for three months. In January, 1996, I      set foot into my new home. We set up a two-thousand-gallon      water tank. I collect rainwater off eight hundred square      feet of roof; the water runs from a gutter system into the      tank. A 12V demand pump supplies the house with water, but      drinking water has to come from the town - a small      compromise with independence, but I can live with it. One      inch of rain gives me about eight hundred gallons of free      water. My horse and I split six hundred gallons      fifty-fifty.    </p>    <p>      The house is all solar-powered. Two 80W solar panels,      mounted on the roof and facing south, supply power to four      6V batteries wired in series to produce 12V power. I use it      to power the demand pump, cellular phone, and 12V      television and VCR. I also have an inverter that gives me      110V to run conventional lights, a radio, fan, blender, and      word processor. On those rare occasions when I need to      dress up, I heat an old-fashioned iron in a flying pan and      use a propane curling iron. My solar system is very simple,      extremely affordable, and is designed so that I could      easily add more panels and batteries to increase my      electrical supply. I do have a generator for emergencies.      It was used to run power tools while building the house,      but I rarely use it now. Propane powers my refrigerator,      gas stove, and the six-gallon water heater. I heat the      house with a woodburning stove, but even in the winter, the      sun keeps the house warm until sunset.    </p>    <h3>Extra Room</h3>        <p>      The Gruey brothers carpenters had an old wood shed in their      backyard. I purchased it from them with the intention of      setting up a simple shed. Soon, with much help from the      brothers, we added two porches to the small shed, rocked up      a foundation, finished the inside, and saw that we had      produced not only a tack room and bead house (for crafts),      but space enough to run a home business.    </p>    <p>      All the esthetic items in my home were Mother Nature's      gifts: rock walls, cactus landscaping, ocotillo fences,      used lumber.    </p>    <p>      We built a two-seater outhouse, to code, with used lumber.      Outhouses and composting toilets are legal here. A septic      tank is a must for the black water; sink or gray water can      be filtered and used on plants.    </p>    <p>      While working with foundation rocks, I quickly became      enthused and decided to attempt a rock building by myself.      What started out to be a tool room turned into a guest      house and cantina. Every morning for about six months, I      would haul one or two loads of rocks and sand from      alongside our rocky roads. I dug a ten-inch-deep footer for      a ten-by-fourteen-foot house, purchased fifteen      ninety-pound bags of Portland cement and began laying up      the rocks. I set a door frame and found two used windows.      As the walls reached shoulder height, my slight frame could      just not lift the rocks, so I hired a helper for the week      at $40 a day. The rafters were four-inch pine poles my      daughter let me cut from her mountain property. The roofing      cost me about $100. Within a week, the casa was finished,      for a total cost of $390. I even built an adobe rock      fireplace. While not an adventure in gorgeous design, the      fireplace looks the part, warms the cantina, and the smoke      goes up.    </p>    <p>      I accomplished all this in less than a year, with $5,000 in      my pocket and no job. Today I own my casita, my land, have      electricity, hot and cold running water, and no bills,      ever. After the initial land purchase, lot sales, and minus      building expenses, I figure my nest actually cost me $510.    </p>    <p>      After this experience, the best advice I can give anyone      is: just follow your dream. When things seem monumental      - and they will - don't look at the total      picture. Take one day at a time. Dwell on figuring out the      problems. Half the fun, believe it or not, is overcoming      them.    </p>    <p>      I have my castle, now the only thing missing is a prince!    </p>
