                <p>      REPORT FROM AMERICA    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Jake Page    </h5>        <p>      <em>The Mount Graham red squirrel is not the only issue on      Emerald Peak.<br />      So is the fate of rare plants.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>EMERALD PEAK, AZ-</strong> The sky is so      clear you're sure it will crack and descend in a cataract      of starlit fragments - you speak too sharply in the night.      And that is the problem up on Mount    </p>    <p>      Graham, located in the Coronado National Forest, a couple      of hours northeast of the neon lights of Tucson, Arizona.      It is an ideal place to look at the stars. And on one of      Mount Graham's several peaks, Emerald Peak, the University      of Arizona wants to build a $200 million observatory      consisting of seven telescopes. To this eight-acre island      of science would also troop a holy alliance of astronomers      from West Germany, Italy and two of the most venerable and      revered institutions in the world, the Smithsonian and the      Vatican.    </p>    <p>      The trouble is that Emerald Peak is inhabited already by      two other entities, one invisible and the other nearly so.      Invisible to all but the nearby San Carlos Apaches are the      mountain spirits who taught the tribe to hunt. Nearly      invisible until recently are some 100 members of a      subspecies known as the Mount Graham red squirrel. In      addition, the peak is home to several species of plants so      rare they don't even have names yet.    </p>    <p>      How muddy can waters get in the more noble affairs of man?      Few of us will deny that the goals of astronomy are pure:      to see back in time to the faintest objects in the      expanding universe, to look in on the origins of the      creation. That the Vatican itself is involved in a dialogue      between science and theology puts a wondrous spin on the      whole affair. But the Mount Graham red squirrel is      protected under the secular laws of the United States, in      particular the Federal Endangered Species Act, and      environmentalists fear that institutionalized stargazing      here could well push the squ'rrel--and some of the rare      plants-into that fearful extinction abyss. So activists are      furious.    </p>    <p>      Acting on the advice of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,      Congress approved the project in 1988, and construction      began. Demonstrations were held at the Smithsonian, and      Earth First!- flung themselves before advancing bulldozers.      As of March 19go, a suit brought by the Sierra Club and      other environmental groups to seek an injunction against      further construction was still pending.    </p>    <p>      WHAT a mess! The Smithsonian, for example, a leader in both      astronomy and natural history, is also currently in the      business of currying the trust of the Native American      community, the better to get its new National Museum of the      American Indian off the ground. The Vatican, in a sense to      atone for its less-than-Solomonic treatment of Galileo, is      seeking a rapprochement with the old fellow's science.      Meanwhile, the Pope himself is in the position of having      blessed this project but also having condemned both the      degradation of ecosystems and the rampant and unconsidered      spread of science and technology in an environmental      message delivered earlier this year.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, University of Arizona astronomers--sounding just      a bit like your typical developer in what is happily called      "multiple use of national forestlands"--say the mountain      has already been logged and is used each summer by, yes, a      Bible class. (Actually, they originally planned to build      the observatory on the deforested section of nearby High      Peak, but the site was changed to heavily wooded Emerald      Peak.) The ecologists at the university, however, decry the      flouting of environmental laws and principles. And the      Apaches mutter veiled threats, suggesting that, wait and      see, the old mountain gods have their own forms of redress.    </p>    <p>      Ironically, one $60 million telescope being readied for      Emerald Peak-two mirrors of eight meters' diameter each-is      called the Columbus Project. And at the same time, the      Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for a shuttle launch, a      multimillion-dollar project that is justified on the      grounds that it win render earthbased astronomy largely      passe.    </p>    <p>      To further disturb the clear atmosphere on the 10,700-foot      Emerald Peak, the litigation process has evidently turned      up some hankypanky worthy of the sleaziest land grab      schemes for which the SouthWest is famous. Apparatchiks in      the Fish and Wildlife Service are accused of leaning on      their own field biologists, who were allegedly ordered to      conclude before the fact-or regardless of fact-that the      squirrels and the telescopes could peacefully coexist on      Emerald Peak. With this report in hand, Congress gave the      project the go-ahead. But now the field biologists,      trusting in their own eyes and their own data, have spilled      the beans to the squirrels' lawyers.    </p>    <p>      If these allegations are true, one can add to one's      instinctive hopes that the squirrels win the hope that the      apparatchiks; be deported for so flagrant a breach of the      public trust. Not to mention the rape of the integrity of      science. And one can also reasonably wonder whether the      astronomers--who are themselves scientists-would fully      enjoy a win brought about in part by the suborning of      science.    </p>    <p>      BUT instinctive hopes, on either side of the issue, may beg      a yet larger question. The search for answers about the      origins of the universe remains a noble put suit. And, in a      world where wildlife biologists talk of triage, we don't      really know how important the Mount Graham red squirrel is      in the scheme of things. In fact, however muddied the      question is by the clash of religions, it finally comes      down to a scientific issue on Emerald Peak.    </p>    <p>      And the decision lies not in what all we true believers on      one side or another know, but in our ignorance.    </p>    <p>      The astronomers are seeking to push back the barriers of      ignorance about the fundamental questions (you'll note that      they and the physicists have sneaked up and laid claim to      "the fundamental questions"). But we are also fundamentally      ignorant about the slightly different universes other      creatures inhabit, and fundamentally ignorant about how to      get along with them (or not), never mind the little problem      we have of getting along amongst ourselves. These are      preeminently ethical questions, now of a planetary scale      and urgency, and our decisions in this realm are still      based upon a sandy underpinning of ignorance...but there is      an ethics to ignorance.    </p>    <p>      There was a time B.G. (Before Galileo) when our ignorance      of astronomical affairs had ethical weight because we were      engaged on a transactional basis with the stars and other      inhabitants of the heavens-angels and other role models.      There were ethical values there then. But modern astronomy      is different. Further details of the Big Bang and its      aftermath are almost certainly going to remain, in the      foreseeable future, morally neutral. As currently      practiced, astronomy can dispel no ignorance that presently      stands in the way of achieving any sort of ethical wisdom      here on earth.    </p>    <p>      We already know, thanks in part to astronomy, that we are      tiny and alone, we and our fellow creatures, padding about      in a thin film of biosphere and, for any practical purpose,      the only ones anywhere saddled with the chore of working      out the business embodied in the term life. Until we      arrived on the scene, life too was a morally neutral      affair. It is only we who assess and assign values to      anything, and so we find ourselves caught up in a dimly      understood web, ignorant of what our place in nature should      be.    </p>    <p>      The ultimate answers may not lie with the Mount Graham red      squirrel at all. But they also definitely do not lie on      Arcturus or in the more precise parsing of lifeless signals      from some quasar spinning idiotically at the edge of the      universe, pulsing emissions that originated millions and      millions of years B.G., indeed long before life itself      arose. On the other hand, every bit of scientific insight      and diminution of ignorance about the biosphere can only be      regarded as useful. Every bit of restraint we practice to      provide ourselves with time and knowledge to reflect on the      value of such a thing as a subspecies, and time to      understand our place in nature, is presumably positive,    </p>    <p>      The showdown at Emerald Peak puts into sharper focus-as      well as symbolic clarity--a question surrounded by a great      deal of murk. It involves the prioritization (an ugly word      for evaluation) of our ignorance. What do we need to know      first? This is also a kind of triage, and scientists don't      like to hear about it (even when it is practiced from      within the priesthood, which it is every day, budgets being      what they are).    </p>    <p>      NEVERTHELESS,scientists should be made aware of the fact      that we-us folks here-think the fundamental questions      concern life on its only known home, the earth, and when      there is a choice to be made, as there is on Emerald Peak,      the choice is obvious. Life on this planet must be given      every chance to win.    </p>    <p>      And if scientists at a university, of all places (never      mind the Smithsonian Institution and the Vatican), cannot      see the difference up in the crystalline air of Mount      Graham's Emerald Peak, then how the hell can we expect      unclouded vision from politicians, public servants and the      brigadiers of industry?    </p>
