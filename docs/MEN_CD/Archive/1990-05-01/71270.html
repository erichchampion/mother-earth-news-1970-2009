            		 		  		 <p><strong>WHEN</strong> the restaurant closed at 9:00 on a      sultry August night, Linda Dickinson ("L.D.") had been in      the cramped little kitchen for eight hours. Her feet hurt,      her back ached, her dark blond hair was plastered to the      back of her neck. So when the Australians banged on the      door at 9:10, she recommended a cafe down the street.</p><p>They      begged. They would have arrived earlier, but they'd gotten      lost. And they'd had a flat tire. And their cat had been      carsick. "It's not that I believed them," L.D. says,      explaining why she fired up the stove and cooked them a      meal. "But when people tell you they've come from Sydney to      Ithaca just to eat at your restaurant, you tend to feed      them."</p><p>As shrines go, Moosewood Restaurant is unimposing.      Its hometown of Ithaca (population 30,000), in the Finger      Lakes region of New York State, is a gorgeous place, graced      with streams, waterfalls, an occasional ravine and Cornell      University. The restaurant itself (seating 56) occupies the      former detention room of a renovated brick school budding.      The basement-level dining room is pleasantly ordinary:      white walls with dark wainscoting, wooden chairs and      tables, print curtains. In between the plants that line the      high windowsills one can glimpse the legs of passersby and,      here and there, a moosewood tree, a local species of maple      and the restaurant's namesake. (According to folklore, the      moose that once populated this area used to pull down      branches and nibble on the leaves.)</p><p>In short, Moosewood      looks like a popular neighborhood eatery (which it is),      indistinguishable from thousands of others (which it      isn't). Since opening its doors *in 1973, Moosewood has      managed to be a major influence on American food, to      attract hundreds of tourists from around the world and to      place its cookbooks on millions of kitchen shelves. How      it's done that has something to do with politics, a little      to do with luck and a lot to do with the people who work      there.    </p>        <p><strong>      IN <em>1973</em></strong>Susan Harville was a vegetarian with a      problem. Three years earlier, she had dropped out of      graduate school to move back to the land. In short order      she had acquired 150 acres outside Ithaca, <em>30</em> beef      cattle, 25 goats, five horses and assorted sheep, lambs,      chickens, ponies, birds, dogs and cats.</p><p>"Living intimately      with animals," she recalls, "was one of the most profound      experiences of my life." Day *in and day out, she fed them,      watered them, cleaned their stalls, assisted at their      births. She was fascinated. They had families, friends,      personality quirks, good days and bad. In fact, they seemed      remarkably like her. Harville lost all appetite for meat.      She was now the owner of a hundred animals she didn't      intend to eat.</p><p>Giving away your beef cattle isn't easy if      you insist on a non-aggression pact from the new owners.      With a hundred mouths to feed, Harville found herself in      need of a paying job. The new vegetarian restaurant that      had opened two weeks before seemed appropriate. She went to      work.</p><p>Moosewood cuisine is primarily vegetarian (although      fish is available on weekends). In 1973 vegetarianism had      seized the American imagination. Two years earlier, Frances      Moore Lappe" had published <em>Diet for a Small      Planet,</em> a ringing indictment of meat-centered diets as      ecologically damaging and wasteful of the scarce resources      of a chronically hungry planet. A raft of politically      correct but aesthetically reprehensible cookbooks-some      merely photocopied booklets-began to circulate. Steamed      tofu and boded soybeans were much in evidence.</p><p>Not at      Moosewood. Then, as now, "Moosers" liked vivid colors,      contrasting textures, complex tastes. They surveyed the      great cuisines of the world and found marvelous dishes that      required no meat. There was no preaching on the premises      (most of the owners and customers are not strict      vegetarians)--just an abundance of good food.</p><p>With the      publication of <em>The Moosewood Cookbook</em> in 1977, the      restaurant acquired nationwide fame. Mollie Katzen, a      founding member of the restaurant, compiled and adapted      recipes for its most popular dishes. The book spoke to a      generation. in revolt against depersonalization.      Hand-lettered and illustrated, it included such recipes as      "Lovely Sesame Sauce" and such directions as "season it      according to your nature, and stuff the shells generously      and with love." Still in print, it has sold over a million      copies.</p><p><em>New Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant,</em>      which appeared in 1987, went through three printings in      nothing flat. Written 'in a more standard cookbook format,      it presents the way Moosewood cooks today--a cuisine less      grainy, less beany, less insistent on nuts and seeds. Few      people who like vegetarian food-whether they're vegetarians      or not-would be without it.</p><p><strong>WHEN</strong> Tony Del      Plato was growing up in Brooklyn, his father drove a city      bus and his mother operated a sewing machine in a      neighborhood sweatshop. Neither had the slightest control      over the conditions of their work. That was how it should      be, his father taught. On the job, in politics, at home-one      man has to be in charge.</p><p>Child rearing is chancy. The son      grew up to become a passionate believer in workplace      democracy, a founder of co-ops, a feminists-a man who      invests enormous energy in living out his egalitarian      values, in creating communities in which people do not      oppress each other in large or small ways. He also grew up      with his Italian-born mother's love of good cooking.</p><p>In      1982 Del Plato joined the Moosewood Collective. As a cook      at a restaurant owned and managed by workers, he feels very      much at home.</p><p>Now 17 years old, the Moosewood Collective      has lasted longer than most. All 17 members work for an      equal wage, share in the profits and lend a hand at      whatever needs to be done. "We think if you're going to run      a business," says Joan Adler, a longtime member, "you      should know how to run all of it, from waiting tables to      ordering supplies." There is no manager, no boss. Every      three weeks the collective meets to discuss issues ranging      from what to do about the grease trap to who is responsible      for children in society.</p><p>"We struggle to find consensus,      struggle to fully understand the other person's point of      view, " says Adler. "As a result we get more ideas and      better decisions. We also become close. We're not just      coworkers. We're family."</p>        <p>      <strong>WHEN</strong> Bob Love finished his Ph.D. in      anthropology at Cornell in 1977, he was offered one job,      and that was in the Philippines. He didn't want to go to      the Philippines. In fact, he didn't want to leave Ithaca.      He turned it down.</p><p>The next morning he woke up, aghast.      Most people don't have the nerve to do that, he thought,      and neither do 1. Now what?</p><p>A specialist in Southeast Asia,      Love had already spent seven years in the Philippines:      three in the Peace Corps, and four engaged in doctoral      research. But programs in Southeast Asian studies, which      had proliferated at universities during the Vietnam War,      dwindled as the war wound down ("academics want to study a      place only if we're fighting there"). Opportunities were      few.</p><p>A thoughtful Love strolled over to Moosewood      Restaurant to eat lunch. As he lingered over a cup of      coffee, he gazed around. This, he thought, is where I      belong. I'm crazy about cooking, I'm sociable and I know a      lot about Southeast Asian food. Eventually, he talked his      way into a job. To the members of the Moosewood Collective,      a man who chooses to be a cook rather than a college      professor has come up in the world. They have boundless      respect for good food. It is worth their best intelligence,      their most careful research, their boldest creativity.      Inevitably, this quality of effort makes itself felt. From      bread crumbs to mayonnaise, everything is made from      scratch. Servings are generous, and prices are reasonable.    </p>        <p><strong>      MAUREEN</strong>Vivino is emphatic: She did not go to Bulgaria just      to have dinner. A student of classical ballet since the age      of five, Vivino became captivated by the rhythms of Balkan      folk dancing while in college. In the summer of 1976, she      headed for Eastern Europe to study music and dance.</p><p>For      three months she toured Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary,      attending festivals, weddings and anniversary celebrations,      staying in small hotels or with families who had a room to      rent. And for three months she ate some of the best food      she'd ever tasted. Superb ice cream and yogurt, absolutely      fresh vegetables from backyard gardens, dozens of different      breads, wonderful new flavors: tangy in Hungary, spicy in      Yugoslavia, milder in Bulgaria. Between dances she copied      down every recipe she could find. Two years later she began      working at Moosewood. And the restaurant started serving a      lot of Balkan food.</p><p>The reason Moosewood Restaurant serves      Italian, Chinese, West African, Armenian, Middle Eastern,      Indian, Indonesian and Mexican dishes, among others, is      that these are what the members of the collective like to      cook. Some times there's a personal connection. Fouad      Makki, from a province in Ethiopia, cooks North African      dishes; Maggie Pitkin, whose ancestors sailed on the      <em>Mayflower,</em> prepares New England food. So,      depending on who's cooking, the menu, which changes with      every meal, may include burritos and piroshki or Malay      fried noodles and Moroccan stew. (The cooks are not      doctrinaire. To a Balkan casserole of feta cheese, buIgur      and zucchini, they will shamelessly add soy sauce and      Cheddar if the combination sounds good.)</p><p>Between meals, the      collective is working on a new cookbook, due out next fall:      <em>Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant,</em> named 'in honor      of the Moosewood tradition of devoting each Sunday night to      an ethnic cuisine. The thought is that, out of the      individual tastes and preferences and talents, a      distinctive, unified work will emerge, better than any one      author could have produced alone. Like the first two books,      like the restaurant itself, the new book will speak very      dearly about the people behind it</p><p>Carol Taylor lives on an old farm in the Blue Ridge      Mountains of    </p>    <p>      The reason Moosewood Restaurant serves Italian, Chi-North Carolina and is a frequent		  contributor to <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.</p><p>The recipes in this article are reprinted from<strong>NEW    RECIPES FROM MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT @</strong>1987 by Vegetable    kingdom, Inc.

Add mustard seeds,      and heat until they begin to pop. Add remaining spices, and      cook on low heat for a couple of minutes to enhance the      flavors of the spices. Be very careful not to bum them. Add      chopped onions, and saute until translucent. Add carrots,      and cook for several minutes.    </p>    <p>      Add potatoes, and cook a few minutes more. Add cauliflower,      and stir well to coat all vegetables with spice mixture.      Add water, cover the pan and, simmer about 20 minutes,      stirring occasionally. When potatoes are tender but not      completely cooked, add tomatoes and peas or green peppers.    </p>    <p>      Simmer covered 10-15 minutes longer. The vegetables should      retain their bright color, and if you use sweet potatoes,      they will soften and become part of the sauce, making it      thicker and more interesting. Serve with condiments. Serves      4-6.    </p>
