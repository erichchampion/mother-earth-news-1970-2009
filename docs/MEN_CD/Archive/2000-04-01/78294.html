                    <p>      <strong>LEGUMES</strong> Edible legumes can be grown for      food as well as cover. When sown in fall, they provide      protection against winter soil erosion. Flowering in      spring, they provide a food source for beneficial insects.      And, even when the pods are harvested, the vines still      provide lots of organic matter - and some nutrients - when      turned back into the soil. Keep in mind, however, that your      soil will benefit most from an unharvested crop turned      under at its nutritional peak.<br />      <br />      <strong>ALFALFA</strong> <em>(Medicago sativa)</em> is a      slow-growing perennial with a deep taproot and aggressive      secondary roots that can be hard to handle. "Nitro-alfalfa"      has become the home gardener's best bet. While faster      growing than regular alfalfa, it's mild-mannered and      therefore easier to kill. Sow in spring or summer.<br />      <br />      <strong>BELL BEAN</strong> <em>(Vicia faba),</em> also      known as fava bean, isn't really a bean at all but rather a      member of the vetch family. A vigorous taproot and abundant      foliage provide an enormous amount of easily tilled organic      matter. Bell beans tolerate acidic soils and temperatures      as low as 15Â°F. Sow in the fall or very early      spring.<br />      <br />      <strong>CLOVERS</strong> include both annuals and      perennials. Berseem clover <em>(Trifolium alexandrinum)      is</em> a productive summer or winter annual that tolerates      a wide range of soil conditions. Crimson clover (      <em>T.</em> <em>incarnatum)</em> , a winter-hardy annual      growing one to three feet high, won't multiply with runners      and is easily eliminated through tilling. Dutch white      clover ( <em>T. repens</em> ), a low-growing perennial, is      easily cultivated and can be grown as a living mulch in      garden paths or between rows of vegetables. Red clover (      <em>T.</em> <em>pratense</em> <em>)</em> is a quick-growing      biennial that can be planted from spring through fall.      Subterranean clover ( <em>T. sub</em> <em>terraneum</em>      <em>)</em> is a cool-season reseeding annual, best for      sowing under taller crops or in vineyards and orchards. New      Zealand white clover <em>(T. repens)</em> is a hardy,      long-lived perennial that is taller and more heat-resistant      than Dutch white clover. Sow clovers spring through fall,      depending on the species.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>PEAS</strong> are edible      legumes and include the cold-hardy field pea <em>(Pisum      sativum)</em> and Austrian field pea <em>(Lathyrus      hirsutus),</em> both of which produce rapid growth in the      spring. Sow in the fall or very early spring. Cowpeas      <em>(Vigna sinensis),</em> also known as Southern peas, are      grown as a summer annual, putting on rapid growth during      hot weather.<br />      <br />      <strong>SOYBEAN</strong> <em>(Glycine max)</em> is an      edible legume that grows well in most soils and is great      for fixing nitrogen during summer heat. Improves scab      control in potatoes. Sow after the danger of frost is      past.<br />      <br />      <strong>VETCHES</strong> include several species of      winter-hardy vining annual or biennial legumes growing from      two to five feet tall. Common vetch <em>(Vicia sativa)</em>      is the most vigorous of the vetches and grows on a wide      range of soils. Hairy vetch ( <em>V.</em> <em>villosa</em>      <em>)</em> is versatile and tolerant of all but the      severest winter temperatures. Purple vetch ( <em>V.</em>      <em>atropurpurea</em> <em>) is</em> less cold-tolerant than      the others, making a good winter-kill mulch in areas with      hard frost.    </p>	<p>			<strong>NON-LEGUMES<br /></strong> This group includes a    variety of grains, grasses and edible green manures.<br />    <br />    <strong>BARLEY</strong> <em>(Hordeum s</em> <em>p.</em> ), a    valuable grain, makes an excellent fast-growing spring cover    crop. It does well in cooler temperatures and tolerates    alkaline soils. Sow in spring or fall.<br />    <br />		</p>    <p>      <strong>BUCKWHEAT</strong> ( <em>Fagopyrum esculentum</em>      ), a weed-smothering broad-leaved annual, reaches heights      of two to four feet. This warm-season grain germinates in      days, grows rapidly and can be easily tilled under in as      little as five to six weeks. Sow spring through midsummer,      after all danger of frost has passed.<br />      <br />      <strong>CEREAL OR WINTER RYE</strong> ( <em>Secale      cereale</em> ) is an aggressive annual and the most      winter-hardy of all cereal grains. It also tolerates      drought better than other grains. Its vigorous root system      is excellent for improving soil structure, but you'll need      a heavy-duty tiller to turn it under. Triticale, a cross      between rye and wheat, is a good substitute. Plant spring      through fall, up to three weeks before ground      freezes.<br />      <br />      <strong>KALE</strong> ( <em>Brassica oleracea</em> ) is a      vigorous, cold-resistant member of the cabbage family.      After you've harvested your patch for food, till the rest      of this winter-hardy annual back in to add iron and copious      amounts of organic matter to the soil. Grow any crop the      following year except members of the cabbage family. Sow in      spring or fall.<br />    </p>        <p>      <strong>MUSTARD</strong> ( <em>Brassica sp.</em> ) is a      winter-hardy annual that tolerates cool, wet soil. Its deep      roots mine the subsoil for nutrients. Sow in spring or      fall.<br />      <br />      <strong>OATS</strong> ( <em>Avena sativa</em> ) are a      fast-growing grain, especially in cool weather, and are      good for adding quick organic matter to the soil. Sow      anytime in spring, summer or fall; fall-sown crops will      winter-kill in most areas of the country, leaving behind a      protective stubble that can be tilled under in      spring.<br />      <br />      <strong>RYEGRASS</strong> ( <em>Lolium multiflorum</em> )      is a fast-growing, robust annual that provides a dense      blanket of green and tolerates a wide range of soil      conditions, even heavy, wet clay. Its extensive fibrous      root system goes deep into the soil. Great winter cover in      mild areas, though if winter-killed it will still help      protect the soil. Sow in spring or fall.<br />      <br />      <strong>SUDAN GRASS</strong> ( <em>Sorghum</em>      <em>sudanense</em> ) is a weed-suppressing summer annual      growing up to six feet tall. It does best in heat and      humidity, is drought-tolerant and good for      nematode-troubled soil. Sow in spring and summer.<br />      <br />      <strong>WINTER WHEAT</strong> ( <em>Triticum aestivum</em>      ) is a dependable, winter-hardy grain that grows best in      cold-winter areas. It germinates quickly, growing an      extensive fibrous root system. Sow in late summer or fall.    </p>
