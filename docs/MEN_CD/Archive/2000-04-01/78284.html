                    <p>      Not according to ConsumerLab.com, an online consumer      watchdog company that has undertaken quality testing of      some of the more popular dietary supplements. Late last      year, the company released the first of its findings: of 30      ginkgo biloba brands analyzed, seven - or roughly 25% - did      not contain sufficient levels of the chemicals known to      give the herb its healing powers.    </p>    <p>      And ginkgo, apparently, is not alone. The <em>Boston      Globe</em> recently reported that of seven St. John's wort      brands tested by an independent laboratory only one      contained the .3% of hypericin (the presumed active      ingredient) promised on the label.    </p>    <p>      Such findings inevitably give rise to cries for more      regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But      the FDA already requires supplement manufacturers to      provide label information that is "truthful and not      misleading." What it doesn't require is that manufacturers      obtain FDA approval before producing dietary supplements,      nor does it routinely analyze supplements before they are      sold to consumers. Rather, manufacturers are trusted to      provide safe products and accurate ingredient lists, while      Uncle Sam steps in only if consumer complaints raise a red      flag.    </p>    <p>      "There is a tremendous need for the industry to standardize      supplements so people at least know that they are getting a      specific ingredient," says Dr. Richard Firshein, author of      <em>The Nutraceutical Revolution</em> and an authority on      nutritional medicine. "I know that there are many, many      supplements that claim to contain a specific ingredient      that actually don't."    </p>    <p>      For now, the onus is on the consumer, says Firshein, to      select a supplement that lives up to its label. Before      choosing a brand, call the manufacturer and ask for      information showing specifically what a given supplement      contains and in what amount "Companies should be able to      provide documentation from independent laboratories," says      Firshein. "If they can't or won't ...then I would choose      another supplement"    </p>    <p>      ConsumerLab.com may make the search for a suitable      supplement simpler. In the coming year, it plans to test a      range of dietary supplements, including echinacea, ginseng,      garlic, St. John's wort and SAM-e. Results will be posted      monthly on the company's Web site, www.consumerlab.com .    </p>
