                    <p>      Antidepressants are drugs designed to block or reduce the      symptoms of depression and anxiety. Most all affect the      levels of one or more neurotransmitters, or chemical      messengers, in the brain-including serotonin, dopamine and      norepinephrine. Low levels of these chemicals have been      linked to depressive disorders.    </p>    <p>      Among the more commonly used antidepressants are monoamine      oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Neurotransmitters relay      messages from one nerve cell to the next; their job      complete, they are either reabsorbed by nerve cells or      broken down by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase. MAOIs,      as their name suggests, block the action of monoamine      oxidase, thereby boosting the levels of serotonin and other      neurotransmitters in the brain.    </p>    <p>      Another newer and increasingly prescribed class of      antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors      (SSRI). SSRIs (including Paxil, Zoloft and Prozac) work by      blocking the reuptake by nerve cells of serotonin released      in the brain.    </p>
