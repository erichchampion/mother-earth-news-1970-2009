                    <p>      <strong>Getting the choicest meals<br />      from local vegetable stands.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne Vassal    </h5>                <p>      Fresher foods: Most of the fruits and vegetables at      farmers' markets have been picked within the previous 24      hours, whereas supermarket produce can be weeks old. Those      blueberries on special this week at our Chicago supermarket      were shipped here from New Jersey, while the farmers'      market berries are driven in daily from Michigan, two hours      away. Last year I compared both and found the Michigan      berries to be the hands-down winner, with their fresh,      white "bloom" and firm skins. The supermarket berries had a      shriveled look and didn't taste as sweet. (This is why I      try to avoid jet-lagged produce.) Freshness is especially      critical for vegetables such as corn that need to be cooked      or at least refrigerated shortly after picking, before      their natural sugars convert to starch. Freshness means      better flavor without the loss of valuable nutrients.    </p>    <p>      <em>Such a deal:</em> While some farmers' market items      (such as blueberries) will cost more in small quantities      than you'd pay at the supermarket, other items are quite a      steal. I can buy five sweet red peppers for $1 and freeze      them for those winter months when they cost $5 per pound.      Buying pecks or half-bushels of peaches, apples and other      items for canning or freezing will save you a good deal of      money. Prices vary, so tour the market before you buy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"How we eat determines to a considerable extent how the      world is used.... Eating is an agricultural act." -Wendell      Berry</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Variety:</em> Where else could you find ten varieties      of peppers, five types of corn and at least two kinds of      peaches? My last trip to market turned up purple peppers,      pattypan squash and an astounding variety of herbs. Another      nearby market carries an array of heirloom tomatoes.      Farmers' markets also may carry plants, fresh-cut flowers,      baked goods and unusual Wisconsin cheeses like basil Brie      (yum!).    </p>    <p>      <em>Healthier, too:</em> Even though there are few      certified organic growers at the farmers' markets in the      Midwest, most of the farmers try to use minimal amounts of      pesticides and sprays. As my favorite melon farmer says,      "There's not even enough [chemical residue] to make you      glow in the dark." At the country's largest farmers' market      in Madison, Wisconsin, about 60% to 70% of the farmers are      using organic methods without being certified organic. And,      guaranteed, you'll never find wax on farmers' market      cucumbers or apples.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, many noncommercial farmers try to preserve their      soil by rotating crops and feeding minerals back into the      earth, which results in healthier food - a benefit not to      be taken lightly. According to the Center for Disease      Control, the increased consumption of fresh produce has      contributed to a rise in foodborne illness. (Perhaps you      may remember reading about the Michigan schoolchildren who      contracted hepatitis A from Mexican strawberries and      another outbreak from a parasite on Guatemalan raspberries)      I'll stick to food grown and sold closer to home - food I      can match whenever possible to a friendly farmer's face.    </p>        <p>      Support your local farmer. The Illinois Department of      Agriculture reports that produce farms are getting scarce      in northern Illinois. One farmer told me that if it wasn't      for the farmers' markets, he couldn't survive. The reason      the supermarket chains can't buy local produce such as      blueberries is that, as one produce manager told me, "We      can't count on the volume." Supermarkets plan their      advertising (the flyers that you get in your newspaper)      months in advance, so they can't take a chance on adverse      weather conditions that could wipe out a crop. That's why,      instead of those delicious Michigan cherries, we'll see      Northwest cherries at our supermarket. Or we'll get those      waxy, tasteless Washington State apples instead of a local      heirloom variety. If we don't support our local farmers, we      may one day find that our farmland has been transformed      into subdivisions dotted with an occasional agri-farm.      Then, we'll all be singing Joni Mitchell's old song, "They      paved paradise and put up a parking lot."    </p>	<p>			<strong>White Bean and Tomato Salad</strong><br />    (serves 2 to 3)		</p>    <p>      Here's a quick salad that's great for lunch.    </p>    <p>      <em>15-ounce or 19-ounce can canellini or northern beans,      drained and rinsed</em> <em><br />      3 plum tomatoes (or 2 medium-size tomatoes), diced into      1/2"pieces</em> <em><br />      1 small red onion, chopped<br />      1/2 cup chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil,      oregano or thyme</em> <em><br />      fresh salad greens for garnish</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dressing:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 1/2 tablespoons each: balsamic vinegar, extra-virgin      olive oil<br />      1 large clove garlic, minced<br />      1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste*<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      This salad is best served at room temperature, within 30      minutes of prepara tion. Toss the salad ingredients      together in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk the      dressing until blended. Pour the dressing over the salad      and toss again. Let sit for about ten minutes to let the      flavors blend. Lay a few greens or arugula leaves on      plates, top with white bean and tomato salad and serve.    </p>    <p>      *Anchovy paste comes in a tube and is usually found in the      imported foods aisle or next to the canned tuna at your      supermarket. Once opened, it will keep indefinitely in the      refrigerator.    </p>	<p>			<strong>Pesto Spread<br /></strong>	</p>	    <p>      Here's an easy way to use up the basil that's usually      plentiful at farmers' markets. I use this spread for      grilled vegetable sandwiches topped with garden lettuce or      for raw vegetable dipping. Store your bunch of basil in a      water-filled glass in the refrigerator, making sure that      the leaves aren't near the refrigerator coils or a cold      spot. Cover the basil loosely with a plastic bag and try to      use it within three days.    </p>	<p>			<em>2 large cloves garlic, peeled<br /></em> <em>1    tablespoon pine nuts or walnuts<br /></em> <em>1 cup basil    leaves, packed<br />    1/4 teaspoon salt</em> <em><br /></em> <em>dash of cayenne    pepper<br /></em> <em>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive    oil<br /></em> <em>1 tablespoon lemon juice<br /></em> <em>1    tablespoon freshly grated Romano or Parmesan cheese</em>    <em><br />    4 ounces "lite" cream cheese*<br /></em>	</p>         <p>      Toast the nuts in a dry skillet on medium heat for a minute      or so, watching that they don't burn. Pick the basil leaves      off the stems. In a food processor, pulse the garlic, nuts      and basil until they're finely chopped. Add the spices, oil      and lemon juice; pulse a few times. Add the Parmesan and      cream cheese; blend well. Chill in a plastic container at      least two hours before serving so the spread will thicken.    </p>    <p>      *Variation: If you like goat cheese, try using 2 ounces      goat cheese and 2 ounces cream cheese in your pesto spread.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Keeping communities alive: Without farmers' markets to      supplement their income, many small farms would simply not      survive.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grilled Vegetables</strong> <em>(minus the      grill)<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      When I want a quick and fresh vegetable sandwich, the last      thing I want to do is fire up the outdoor grill. Here are      my "let's pretend" grilled vegetables from the garden.    </p>    <p>      <em>eggplant, zucchini, summer squash, red or yellow sweet      peppers, red onion</em> <em><br /></em> <em>olive oil</em>      <em><br /></em> <em>smoke oil* (organic oil)</em>    </p>     <p>      Cut the ends off the eggplant, zucchini and/or squash and      cut in half horizontally. Stand the cut vegetables up on      their ends and cut into 1/8"-thick slices. Cut the peppers      lengthwise into 8 strips. Slice the onion into 1/4"      circles. Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high      heat. Brush the bottom of the pan with olive oil and smoke      oil. When the oil is hot, lay the vegetables in the skillet      and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned.      Turn the pieces over and brown the other sides.    </p>     <p>      Have a large, shallow plastic container ready. Remove the      browned vegetables and pile the eggplant slices on top of      each other in the container, then the zucchini, and so on.      (Some of the vegetables won't appear thoroughly done, but      they'll continue to cook as they sit in the container.)    </p>    <p>      Let cool at least 15 minutes; then eat or cover the      container and refrigerate until later.    </p>     <p>      *We're hooked on smoke oil so we buy it by the case from      the manufacturer. "Barbecue Smoke Oil" costs about $3.50      for an 8-ounce bottle. The mesquite flavor is intense, so      use sparingly. Look in the gourmet section of your      supermarket or health food store or have some delivered      direct to your door by contacting the California Olive Oil      Corp., 134 Canal St., Salem, MA 01970, (978) 745-7840.    </p>	<p>			<strong>Vegetable Medley</strong> (serves 3 to 4)<br />		</p>    <p>      I like to throw together any combination of fresh summer      vegetables (a favorite is pattypan squash) to saute and      serve with crusty bread. It's enough to satisfy our      appetites on a hot summer's night.    </p>        <p>      1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br />      <em>6 yellow or green pattypan squash, sliced into 1/2"      cubes<br />      1 large garlic clove, minced<br />      2 cups yellow wax beans (or green beans), cut into 1      "pieces<br />      1/2 a poblano pepper*<br />      kernels sliced from 1 large ear of corn<br />      salt and pepper to taste<br />      Asiago cheese, coarsely grated<br />      chopped, fresh basil or oregano leaves**</em> <em><br />      </em>     </p>    <p>      Cut the vegetables and put into separate bowls. Slice the      poblano into thin strips and then into 1" pieces. In a      large, nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium to      medium-high heat and add the pattypans. Stir every minute      or so until they start to soften. Add the garlic, yellow      beans and peppers and saute until they're crisp-tender,      stirring about every 60 sec onds. Stir in the corn for      about another minute or until done. Remove from heat and      season to taste. Top with grated Asiago cheese and fresh      herbs.    </p>    <p>      *A poblano pepper is a green, slightly hot pepper used in      Mexican cooking. If they're not available at your farmers'      market, use any color sweet pepper.    </p>    <p>      **To chop fresh basil into a chiffonade, tightly roll up      three large basil leaves lengthwise. Start chopping the      basil at one end into paper-thin slices that will unroll      into thin strips.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Microwave Peach Crisp</strong> (serves 2)    </p>    <p>      I like Jeanne and John Van Newenhizen's fast and easy peach      crisp, which doesn't require a hot oven on a hot day. The      VanNewenhizens own the Double J Fruit Ranch in Benton      Harbor, Michigan, and are known at the farmers' markets for      their delicious fruit.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 large or 2 smaller ripe peaches*<br />      1/3 cup quick cooking oats<br />      2 tablespoons dark brown sugar<br />      2 tablespoons butter<br />      dash of nutmeg</em>    </p>    <p>      Peel and slice the peaches into two custard cups (or one      small microwave-safe casserole) until cups are almost full.      Mix the rest of the ingredients in a glass measuring cup.      Microwave** on high, uncovered, until the butter melts and      the oats soften (60-70 seconds). Stir the topping and spoon      over the peaches. Microwave uncovered for about two minutes      (rotating the cups after one minute), until the peaches are      soft. Serve warm or at room temperature, topped with      vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt.    </p>    <p>      *Variation: This recipe can be made with apples or pears,      but add teaspoon cinnamon.    </p>    <p>      **Microwave ovens vary depending on wattage. The cooking      time here is according to my microwave.    </p>    <p>      Discover more recipes in MOTHER's KITCHEN at <em><br />      </em> <strong>www.motherearthnews.com</strong>    </p>    <p>      Related info<br />      The Market Scam    </p>
