                          <p>      <strong>Improve your soil and increase vegetable<br />      yields with easy-to-grow cover crops.</strong>    </p>      <h5 id="byline">        by Kris Wetherbee      </h5>            <p>      Whether you garden in raised beds, a small backyard or on      acres of land, cover crops can provide a wealth of benefits      to the garden. For one, they often grow fast and develop in      thick stands. Plus, they provide nutrients to turn a cover      crop hack into the garden while the plant is still green      and it's called "green manure."    </p>    <p>      If you have a weed problem, fast-growing cover crops like      buckwheat, red clover or Austrian peas can outcompete and      smother unwanted invaders. Even closely planted sunflowers,      with their allelopathic tendencies, are a good      weed-suppressing crop. While a sunflower grows, it      temporarily inhibits nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil      ...bad news for the germination and growth of any plant      needing nitrogen. And few plants need nitrogen more to      germinate and grow than do the weed grasses.    </p>    <p>      Is your garden crawling with pest insects? Cover crops are      a boon to beneficial life - providing food and shelter for      both soil-dwelling creatures and aboveground insects that      pollinate and help control garden pests. Countless      beneficial insects thrive on the pollen or nectar of cover      crops in bloom. (Pest insects, conversely, feast not ran      pollen but on plants, choosing their targets by the gaseous      odors they emit. In my experience, cover crops have far      less trouble with pest insects than do vegetable crops.)    </p>    <p>      If you're looking to lure welcome guests to your garden,      look no further: alfalfa attracts a host of parasitic      wasps, lady beetles, damsel bugs, big-eyed bugs and      assassin bugs. White clover attracts tachinid flies, ground      beetles and parasitic wasps that prey on aphids, scales,      caterpillars and whiteflies. Most grains attract lady      beetles. Clovers and vetches attract minute pirate bugs.      Fava beans attract predatory and parasitic wasps, as does      buckwheat, which has the added benefit of luring syrphid      flies (also called hover flies) and bumblebees.    </p>        <p>      Cover crops are good for the environment, too. Established      legumes or fall sown, grains and grasses that quickly cover      the ground protect the most fertile part of your soil from      erosion caused by assailing winds and pounding storms.      Likewise, grasses, grains and brassicas that grow quickly      in the fall help capture easily leached nutrients like      nitrogen and calcium before they wash away with winter      rains. When you turn these crops under in spring, the      needed nutrients are released back into the soil.    </p>    <p>      Cover crops also regulate soil temperature, keeping the      earth cooler in summer and warmer in winter. By providing      an insulating blanket, they allow important soil life to      thrive, especially earthworms. The more worms in your      garden, the more effective they'll be at creating channels      to break up and aerate the soil. And, once that blanket of      green is turned under, it returns to the earth an abundance      of organic matter essential to earthworms and other soil      creatures, which in turn are at the very heart of healthy      soil.    </p>    <p>      Finally, if you want to fertilize your garden naturally,      grow cover crops. Legumes such as vetches, alfalfas and      clovers can actually transport nitrogen right out of the      air we breathe and into the soil, where bacteria can then      convert it into a plant-friendly form. Grains and other      cover crops also work to replenish the soil, by recycling      nutrients normally beyond the reach of other plants. Their      roots reach deeply into the subsoil, drawing up valuable      minerals and nutrients that are then stored in the plants'      tissues. Once the cover crop is turned back into the soil      and allowed to decompose, those nutrients gradually become      available to future plants.    </p>		<h3>Choosing Your Cover Crop		</h3>    <p>      Which are the best cover crops to grow? Your choices are      limited only by your needs. Do you want cover in the      spring, summer, fall or winter? Is your goal to add the      most abundant organic matter, tremendous amounts of      nitrogen, bring up valuable nutrients from the subsoil or      grow a killer crop that suppresses the nastiest of weeds?      Where you live, along with your soil and climate      conditions, can also play a factor. Ultimately, you'll want      a crop that works for you - not one that's going to become      a nuisance.    </p>        <p>      Suggestions for which crops to grow are listed in the      chart, " At A Glance: Best Crops for Special Conditions "      There are, however, some generalities that can help you      decide which covers to grow. First, decide whether you want      an annual or perennial. Annuals usually grow fast, are      quick to establish, last a season and won't resprout from      their roots. Perennials tend to be deeprooting (though some      annuals are as well), slow to establish and are great for      areas, like orchards and vineyards, where you want a      long-term cover.    </p>    <p>      Second, consider which of the two basic groups of covers      you'd like to grow: legumes or grasses and grains. All add      a certain amount of organic matter (though grasses and      grains tend to add more). Legumes decompose rapidly when      turned under and are unsurpassed as nitrogen-catchers,      securing more of this important element in the soil than      any other cover crop.		</p>        <p>      Grasses and grains, on the other hand, often germinate and      grow quicker than legumes, making them the first-choice for      fast, effective ground covers. They are also especially      valued for the bulky organic matter they add to soil, as      well as for reducing nematodes in the garden.    </p>    <p>      But why not grow a mix so you can have the best of both      worlds? Your fast-growing grains will act as a nurse crop      to help sustain and provide support for your slower-growing      vining legumes. Plus, the legume-grass/grain combination      holds nitrogen in the soil better than either grown alone.    </p>		<h3>When to Plant		</h3>    <p>      Depending on where you live, you can plant cover crops      anytime from early spring through late fall. Spring or      summer planted covers can be used as part of your rotation,      grown between rows or underneath established vegetables.      Frost-tolerant covers like bell bean, Austrian peas and      oats can be planted as soon as your soil can be worked. For      others, like cowpeas, buckwheat and soybeans, wait until      all danger of frost has passed.    </p>        <p>      Fall and winter covers are sown as early as August in cold      climates and as late as November in the deep South.    </p>    <p>      Since I sow a variety of cover crops, I'm usually planting      throughout the year. In the spring I might sow      nitro-alfalfa and spring oats, which are turned under in      midsummer, before I plant my fall crops. Buckwheat is an      excellent green manure for summer (I plant in May or June,      tilling under six to ten weeks later). Fava beans, Austrian      peas, crimson clover and vetch are my favorites for      planting in the fall (September or early October here in      our mild zone 8 Oregon climate) and then tilling under in      spring.    </p>        <p>      Together, these crops provide erosion protection against      our considerable winter rains, organic matter to loosen our      heavy clay soil, plus nutrients - specifically nitrogen,      but also phosphorus (supplied by buckwheat) - in which our      soil tends to be lacking.    </p>    <p>      Every year I also plant my previously weediest bed with      sunflowers - the lazy gardener's way to control wild      growth.    </p>		<h3>How to Plant		</h3>    <p>      Planting your cover crop is easy you don't have to worry      about tilling the soil first. Just clear the bed of weeds      and spent vegetables, then rake the soil free of clumps.      You'll need an average of one and a half cups of seed to      sow a 100-square-foot area.    </p>     <p>      Use a broadcaster or throw your seeds on by hand, then work      in with a rake or cover with additional soil. A good rule      of thumb is to cover the seed to a depth three times its      diameter. Water thoroughly and be sure to keep watering in      summer or during dry weather.    </p>    <p>      It's important to remember to use an inoculant on any      legume seed before you plant. These commercially available      powdered substances contain live rhizobia bacteria. While      different legume crops are naturally host to different      types of rhizobia bacteria, inoculants ensure that      sufficient populations of the right rhizobia are present at      the right time (the inoculant's packaging should tell you      which crop it's intended for). Rhizobia bacteria colonize      the roots of legumes and feed from their carbohydrates. In      return, the bacteria take gaseous nitrogen from the air and      change it to a form that plants (both legumes and their      neighbors) can use. This symbiotic process, commonly known      as nitrogen-fixation, is one you'll want to encourage to      ensure that your legumes absorb the maximum amount of      nitrogen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AT A GLANCE : BEST CROPS FOR SPECIAL      CONDITIONS<br />      Tolerates Acidic Soil:</strong> bell beans, most clovers,      most vetches, buckwheat <strong><br />      Tolerates Alkaline Soil:</strong> alfalfa, barley,      ryegrass, Sudan grass <strong><br />      Tolerates Drought Conditions.</strong> alfalfa, hairy      vetch, barley, cereal rye, ryegrass, Sudan grass      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>Tolerates Wet      Conditions.</strong> bell beans, subterranean clover,      Austrian peas, mustard, oats, ryegrass <strong><br />      </strong> <strong>Tolerates Shade:</strong> most clovers,      hairy vetch, cereal rye, ryegrass <strong><br /></strong>      <strong>Tolerates</strong> <strong>or Enjoys H</strong>      <strong>eat</strong> cowpeas, soybeans, buckwheat, Sudan      grass <strong><br /></strong> <strong>Breaks Up Compacted      Soil/Deep Roots:</strong> alfalfa, bell beans, most      clovers, barley, buckwheat, cereal rye, kale, mustard,      ryegrass <strong><br />      Suppresses Weeds:</strong> most clovers, Austrian peas,      field peas, soybeans, vetches, barley, buckwheat, cereal      rye, oats, ryegrass, Sudan grass    </p>    		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      SEED SOURCES    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Fedco Seeds</strong> P.O.

For legumes, the prebloom stage is      ideal. Grasses and grains should be turned under when they      start to form grain heads (though most can be turned under      sooner, this is when they are at their nutritional peak).    </p>    <p>      Exceptions to these rules are legume or grass/grain crops      planted in fall, which are then turned under in spring      (usually May or June), and, in my experience, cereal rye      and ryegrass, both of which can get quite vigorous and      should be cut, then turned under before grain heads form.    </p>    <p>      If a crop is tall, you should first mow it, weed-whack it      or use a scythe. Compost the tops or till, hoe or dig them      in along with the remaining stubble. After digging your      cover in, wait at least two to three weeks before planting      again. This allows the soil microbes and organisms to begin      breaking down the plant material into valuable nutrients,      bringing rich rewards to your soil - and your harvest.    </p>    <p>      Related info:<br />      The Crops    </p>
