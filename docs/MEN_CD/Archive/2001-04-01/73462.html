                            <p>      If you want to find the bird, you should rely on your ears      as well as your eyes. According to master birder Roger Tory      Peterson, the scarlet tanager's singing is like that of a      robin "with a sore throat." May is the best month to spot      the scarlet tanager - as spring gives way to summer, the      males' bright red plumage turns to a yellowish-green.      Scarlet tanagers are most common in the eastern half of the      U.S. from southeastern Oklahoma to northern Alabama and      from northern Georgia to just above the U.S.-Canadian      border. Related species are not quite as bright but are      beautiful in their own right. The male Western tanager,      common to the western states, has a red face and a yellow      body with black back, wings and tail. The male summer      tanager of the southeastern U.S. is red all over.    </p>
