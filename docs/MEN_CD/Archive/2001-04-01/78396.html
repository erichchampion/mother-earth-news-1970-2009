                    <p>      <strong>Step</strong> <strong>1 MAKING A STARCH      PASTE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Add 1 part white flour to 2 parts cold water, and set      aside. Boil 1 1/2 parts water. When boiling, add the above      mixture of flour and cold water.    </p>    <p>      Turn heat to low, continue to cook until the mixture      thickens. Continually stir the bottom to prevent burning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 2</strong> <strong>MAKING THE PAINT</strong>    </p>    <p>      For every 1 part starch paste, dilute with 2 parts water.      That will make the paste liquid enough to permit adding the      other ingredients.    </p>    <p>      Next, add enough colored clay or white kaolin clay with      pigments to achieve a consistency that will spread easily      with a brush. It is difficult to describe, but we look for      a mixture that will cover in two coats. The right      consistency will be like thick cream. Mica can be added to      simulate clays that have naturally occurring mica. Fine      (screened) chopped straw can also be added. If adding      either or both, add less clay since the mica and straw will      also thicken the mix.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Step 3 APPLICATION AND POLISHING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Apply with a brush; when the paint has set but is still      moist, use a damp (not wet) tile sponge to polish the      surface, removing excess dust and revealing the straw and      mica. A plastic lid with the edges cut off can also be used      as a flexible scraper to further polish the surface.    </p>
