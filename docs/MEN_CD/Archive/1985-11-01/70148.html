                    <p>      You can kiss wasteful disposable batteries goodbye by      building your own less-than-$6.00 . . .    </p>        <p>      The common battery is a prime example of a product that      usage transforms all too quickly from a valuable device      into a piece of hazardous waste. And much of this      accumulation of dangerous junk is needless, since      rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells can easily be substituted      for conventional batteries in many applications. These      sturdy little power sources may cost twice as much as even      highquality alkaline cells, but they'll make up the price      difference many times over as they go through hundreds of      charge-discharge cycles.<br />      <br />      From a practical standpoint, though, you shouldn't replace      every battery in your house with a ni-cad. The      rechargeables are most valuable in appliances that are used      regularly and extensively-for example, a desk      calculator that's operated daily, or a toy that a toddler      just can't remember to turn off. In a year's time you could      run through dozens of conventional cells in a heavily used      appliance, while the <em>same</em> use wouldn't make a      significant dent in a nicad's life expectancy. On the other      hand, the flashlight that sits idly in the glove      compartment month after month will do better with alkaline      cells. Because nicads self-discharge at a rate of 1% to 3%      of their capacity per day, they'd go flat in an unused      flashlight within a month or two; an alkaline cell,      however, might stay on call for a year or more.</p>      <h3>PROPER CARE AND FEEDING</h3>     <p>      To get the most from your investment in nicad cells, you      need to treat them right. Don't use ni-cads in applications      that drain their power too quickly: A case that's hot to      the touch is a sure sign of strain. In general,      nickelcadmium batteries shouldn't be drawn down from full      charge to flat in less than an hour, though short spells of      high discharge won't harm them. Also, it's best to avoid      repeated cycles of equivalent partial discharge and      charge-as with a calculator you use a bit each day      and charge every night. A ni-cad will develop a sort of      electrochemical memory of the partial discharge, and you'll      lose access to its full capacity. (However, such a cell      <em>can</em> be restored by draining it all the way flat      and then charging it fully.)<br />      <br />      Most important, though, a nickel-cadmium battery must be      charged at the correct amperage. A good slow charger      applies a current that's equal to about one-tenth of the      battery's amp-hour capacity. Thus a 1.1-amphour ni-cad (a C      or D cell) should be charged at about 0.110 amperes. A      completely discharged battery will be restored in 14 to 16      hours at this charging rate, though it will be usable in 6      to 7 hours. (Ni-cads can be charged at rates high enough to      restore their capacity in an hour, but the charger must      then be shut off to prevent battery damage.)</p>			<h3>THE DESIGN</h3>    		<p>      When contributor James E. Bialy sent us a slick design for      a AA ni-cad battery charger that works off an automobile's      electrical system, we were impressed . . . but we just      weren't able to leave well enough alone. Our tinkerers      figured that for a minor increase in cost, Bialy's      brainstorm could be made to charge a wide range of ni-cad      cells. In our adaptation, amperage is controlled to 0.135      amperes by a power resistor (R1), and three switched      resistors (R2, R3, and R4) make the final drops to provide      0.007 amps for 9-volt batteries, 0.045 amps for AAs, and      0.110 amps for C and D cells.<br />      <br />      We also added a transistor (TR1) to Bialy's schematic. The      semiconductor, when biased by resistor R5, limits charging      current to the value selected with the switch. Without it,      the charge rate would change as the internal resistance of      the ni-cad dropped during charging. This addition is an      improvement over most commercial ni-cad chargers. (Note:      Any 2-watt or heat-sinked 1-watt NPN power transistor could      be substituted for the 40-watt Radio Shack item. It's      simply the lowest-rated suitable device available from the      company.)    </p>        <p>      You can use the printed circuit design we've provided, or a      1-13/16" X 2-1/2" piece of perforated circuit board, to      secure the capacitors, resistors, diodes, and transistor.      Make sure that the negative sign on the large capacitor is      running toward the negative powerconnection solder pad      (down, as you look at the printed-circuit side of the      board) and that the diode Dl's band is toward the powerin      end of the board. Diode D2, a 15-volt zener, must have its      black band on the end nearest the positive power-connection      solder pad (up). The capacitors and diode D2 absorb (or      bypass) transient power surges from the car's alternator,      and diode D1 prevents the ni-cad's power from back-flowing      when the charger is connected to a switched circuit in the      car's wiring system. Also, be sure to connect the      transistor so that B, C, and E on the circuit board match      the key on its package. The resistors can be wired either      way, but be sure that resistor R1 has at least a 2-watt      power rating. (Again, Radio Shack's minimum suitable item      is rated at 10 watts.)<br />      <br />      Because the resistors and transistor dissipate power to      limit the charging rate, the circuit board generates heat.      Consequently, you should drill a half-dozen 1/4" holes in      the bottom of the Radio Shack project box to allow air to      circulate. The circuit board-with the parts pointing      down-sits on the ridges in the plastic box and should be      glued in place. The rotary switch is secured in a 3/8" hole      in the box's cover. (Note: If you can locate a 4-position      switch, such as the Digi-Key item noted in the Bill of      Materials, it can be substituted for the 12position Radio      Shack switch.) To wire the switch, look for the contact      brush underneath the connectors to determine which post      connects to which circuit. Then double-check your wiring      with a continuity tester-this is an easy place to make a      mistake. And when you mount the switch on the case cover,      mark the positions for 9-volt, AA, and C and D clearly, to      match 82 ohms, 15 ohms, and 5 ohms respectively. Two pairs      of wires pass through holes drilled in the box's ends: the      power connection and the leads for the 9-volt battery snap      connector. The power connection can be in the form of      insulated wires, the positive of which you'll connect to      your car's fuse box. Or, if you're feeling flush, you can      pay a couple of dollars for a cigarette lighter plug (use a      3-amp fused model), which will allow a more convenient      connection for your charger. In any case, tie a      figure-eight knot in each pair of wires just inside the      case to prevent tension on the circuit board.<br />      <br />      If you decide to hard-wire your charger into the car,      you'll have to choose between a switched and an unswitched      circuit. The former will be turned off when you shut your      engine off, thus preventing drain from your car's battery;      the latter will allow continuous charging whether or not      the engine is on. Frankly, the amount of power the charger      uses is so small that it would take months to pull down a      healthy car battery.<br />      <br />      You can connect a pair of AA batteries (in a Radio Shack      battery holder, No. 272-382+) or a 9volt directly to the      9-volt snap connector. To charge C or D cells, take another      9volt snap connector (you're the proud owner of five of      these if you bought from Radio Shack), and solder its leads      to a battery holder that will handle two cells. Then you      can connect the two 9-volt snaps. Bear in mind that the      batteries you charge at one time (up to seven will work)      must be wired in series (positive to negative, positive to      negative, etc.). Only one 9-volt cell can be connected at a      time.<br />      <br />      One of the most attractive aspects of Mr. Bialy's use of a      car's electrical system to charge ni-cad batteries is that      most of us use our vehicles daily. Thus we'll be reminded      of the cells under charge and avoid wasting power by      leaving the batteries on too long. (The charging rate is      low enough that the batteries can't be damaged by      overcharging.) Those of you who live in cold climates,      however, please take note: Ni-cads should never be charged      at a temperature lower than freezing; at less than      32°F, the charge rate must be reduced to prevent      damage.<br />      <br />      If, for this or other reasons, you'd prefer a charger that      plugs into the wall, you could adapt this circuit with a      12.6-volt transformer (such as Radio Shack's No. 273-1385).      Use a larger project box (Radio Shack No. 270-222 will      work), eliminate D2 and C2, and use a 470-microfarad      capacitor for C1. Remember that you'll be dealing with line      current, and shocks from the 120-VAC side of the circuit      can be life threatening.<br />      <br />      Whichever way you choose to charge, you'll be doing your      part to mend our disposable society ... and you're going to      save a fair amount of money in the process.    </p>
