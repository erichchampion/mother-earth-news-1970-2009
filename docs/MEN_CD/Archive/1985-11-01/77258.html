                <p>      Here's the fifteenth in a series of articles that will hep      you tell friend from foe in your garden.    </p>        <p>      Part XV: The Praying Mantis    </p>		<h5 id="byline">by Ron West</h5>                     <p>      If you're like most folks, you probably stoop occasionally      to inspect an insect. But how would you feel if the bug you      were looking at slowly turned its head and <em>stared back      at</em> you? Well, the praying mantis can do just that. In      fact, it has the distinction of being the <em>only</em>      predatory insect that can swivel its head to look over its      shoulder. (The praying mantis is one species <em>[Mantis      religiosa]</em> of the mantid family [Mantidae] and is also      commonly known as the praying mantid. Most mantid species      found in North America share the same general      characteristics and are often referred to as mantises.)    </p>    <p>      Additionally, the mantis is endowed with specially adapted      forelimbs that are held in a prayerlike position while the      voracious predator awaits its lunch. But, of course, this      namesake pose is just that . . . a pose. (As one      entomologist quipped, "The only thing mantids would seem to      pray for is a square meal.") In fact, a mantid's      forelimbs-rather than being hands designed for      supplication-are greatly enlarged legs that are lined      with sharp spines and can snap out with lightning speed to      snatch up a victim and hold it fast while the mantis      devours it alive. (All in all, highly irreverent behavior.)    </p>    <p>      In contrast to those outsized, raptorial forelimbs, the      four remaining legs are spindly. But no matter, really,      since the mantis doesn't chase down its prey; rather, it      waits patiently in ambush for dinner to stroll or flutter      by. Since it's not a picky eater, the mantis will gobble up      just about any sort of insect that happens along. Larger      mantids have even been known to tackle lizards and small      birds, and though they're not generally aggressive toward      humans, some can inflict nasty bites if handled carelessly.    </p>    <p>      Members of the family Mantidae are long and slender, with      some species reaching four inches or more in length. Most      of the largest varieties, including the majority of those      sold for insect control, arrived in the U.S. by accident:      In 1899 they were brought in on nursery stock imported from      Europe. Despite its formidable size, the mantid's green or      brown camouflage makes it extremely difficult to spot as it      sits motionless against a background of foliage.    </p>    <p>      During courtship, the male mantis must sneak up on the      female from behind, using great caution-for if she      spots him before he can grasp her, she'll kill and eat him.      End of romance. But should the male be successful in wooing      his flame into mating with him, he may well have romanced      himself out of the frying pan and into the fire. The female      mantises, which are much larger than the males, will      sometimes bite the heads off their lovers-even as the      mating ritual progresses (talk about losing your head for      love!). Interestingly, though, removing the male's head may      trigger even more aggressive mating (at least until the      bride gets around to finishing her meal).    </p>    <p>      When the time comes for the fertilized female to lay her      eggs (usually in the fall of the year), she seeks out a      small branch to serve as a nesting platform. With her eggs      deposited- usually in clusters of 80 to 100-mother      mantis covers them with a frothy secretion that dries into      a substance with a consistency something like Styrofoam.      Thus insulated against the cold and somewhat protected from      insect-eating creatures, the eggs pass the winter to hatch      the following spring.    </p>    <p>      The young mantids-which resemble adults except for      their smaller size, some subtle differences in coloration,      and the absence of visible wings-undergo a simple      metamorphosis by molting each time they grow too large for      their old skins. By late summer or early fall, the spring's      mantid hatch is fully grown and ready to mate-thus      completing the life cycle.    </p>    <p>      As I mentioned earlier, mantids are advertised and sold      (generally by mail order) for the purpose of controlling      garden insects. The trouble is, while these hungry hunters      will indeed put a dent in your garden's pest population,      they'll also seriously reduce the number of      <em>beneficial</em> insects. (A mantis has never been known      to ask "friend or foe?" before snatching up and wolfing      down a passing bug.) Consequently, if you're having      problems with a particular type of insect pest and wish to      try biological control methods, the best bet isn't mantids,      but <em>host-specific</em> insect predators and parasites      purchased from a reputable insectary.    </p>    <p>      That's not to say you should destroy any mantises you might      spot praying (and preying) in your garden, since a few      native mantids will do a garden's ecosystem no harm, and      this shark of the insect world makes an interesting      addition to the backyard fauna. After all, how many other      insects have the gumption and ability to turn their heads      and look you right in the eye when you rudely stare at them      . . . much less the piety to "pray" before each and every      meal?    </p>
