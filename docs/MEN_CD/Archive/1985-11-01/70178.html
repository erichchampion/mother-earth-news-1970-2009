                <p>      <em>Now that the computer revolution has settled down to      capable equipment at attractive prices,</em> <em>maybe it's      time for you to start thinking about...</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by TJ Byers    </h5>        <p>      This is the time of year when most of us are planning our      holiday shopping lists. And we'd naturally like to select      presents that are as practical as they are attractive. One      item that has both appeal and purpose is a home computer.      Since its introduction some ten years ago, the small (or      micro, as it's known in the industry) computer has grown in      popularity to the point where 25% of all households in the      U.S. now own or have access to one. What's more, it's      estimated that over 40% of all homes will have a personal      computer by 1990.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      WHAT IS A COMPUTER?    </h3>    <p>      Coleco Adam    </p>    <p>      <em>If you're looking for a</em>      <em>fully featured      computer package at a      reasonable price, the      Coleco Adam is one      good choice. The      system comes      complete with a      keyboard, a high-      speed tape cassette      for saving and      retrieving data,      software, and a letter-      quality printer. All you      have to add is a video      monitor.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>An interesting feature      of the Adam system is      a built-in word      processor-a feature      that accounts for 38%      of most people's use      of a computer. When      you turn the Adam on,      it becomes an      electronic typewriter,      printing whatever you      type on the keyboard      onto paper in the      printer. Pressing the      ESCAPE key, however,      starts the word      processor, which      allows you to edit      material on the screen      before it's printed.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Adam computers list      for $800, but sluggish      sales have forced      most retailers to drop      prices. As I write this,      a local merchant is      offering his entire      stock at a very low      $200 each.</em>    </p>		</div>    <p>      Contrary to popular lore, the computer isn't the      number-crunching monster so many of us have come to      envision. Rather, it's a tool that can be used to lighten      our daily burden. Like the plow or tractor, a computer can      relieve us of chores and allow us to use our time more      productively. The variety of tasks a computer can take on      increases daily. To many people, a computer is merely an      expensive video game . . . but to an increasing number, it      serves such roles as teacher, tax consultant, or      even-as the sidebar on software shows-garden      planner.    </p>    <p>      In each case, the computer offers a service. The extent of      that service is a topic MOTHER will take up in future      issues as we discuss some of the specific tasks a home      computer can perform. For now, though, let's concern      ourselves with the task of selecting a suitable machine by      sorting through the many options available.    </p>    <h3>      CHOOSING A COMPUTER    </h3>    <p>      There are literally hundreds of computers to choose from      today, ranging in price from a few hundred to many      thousands of dollars. Home computers, the ones we'll be      talking about here, generally fall into the $200 to $1,200      price range. And within this range, package prices will      vary depending on the particular components needed. Some      tasks, for instance, require a mechanical printer, while      other applications need a device to hook the computer to a      telephone line. The more complex you make your system, the      more it will cost.    </p>    <p>      Basically, computer systems can be broken down into two      types of components. First there's the hardware, central to      which is the computer itself-the seemingly magical      "black box" that makes everything happen. A video monitor      connected to the computer tells you what the machine is      thinking, and a keyboard lets you tell the computer what      you're thinking. Keyboards come as a part of the computer      package and may actually be integral. Monitors, however,      are usually purchased separately-largely because      there are a number of choices (see the sidebar "Video      Monitors"), not because they're dispensable.    </p>    <p>      The second main component of a computer system is its      software. Each of these packages of numerical instructions      tells the computer how to perform a certain task. This      article, for example, was written using a software package      called a word processor. There are software packages that      calculate taxes, estimate profits, and plan menus. The      applications are limited only by your imagination and the      physical traits of your machine. With the right software,      even an inexpensive computer can perform an amazing variety      of tasks; without it, the fanciest rig is useless.    </p>    <h3>      MAKE A PLAN    </h3>    <p>      Before you even start shopping for a computer, you should      decide what you want the computer to do for you and how      much you're willing to pay for that service.    </p>    <p>      What will be the computer's main use? Will it be for      education-such as teaching the young ones their ABCs?      Or perhaps you want a computer in order to hone your own      math skills. If education fits your computer's job      description, look for one that has a large and broad base      of learning software. The computer itself should be capable      of displaying attractive graphics, which are so important      to keeping the attention of a child. Both the Radio Shack      Color Computer and the Atari 800 handle graphics well, are      inexpensive, and have quite a bit of educational software      written for them. Apple may have the largest selection of      educational software-because their II-series      computers are often used in schools-but the firm's      hardware <em>and</em> software are relatively expensive.    </p>    <p>      If you want a computer primarily for playing games, you      should once again be looking for good graphics and a broad      software base. Bear in mind, though, that most popular      games are written for more than one computer, so don't let      the availability of a particular game sway you too much.      After all, when you tire of that game, what's to take its      place?    </p>    <p>      For the more serious computer user, there are software      packages for record keeping and for information processing.      For these applications, a clear display of characters is      more important than graphics capability. In computer lingo,      a machine's record-keeping software is called a <em>data      base,</em> and its information processing falls under the      guise of a <em>word processor</em> or a      <em>spreadsheet.</em> Don't let the jargon throw you: Word      processors handle words, and spreadsheets manipulate      numbers (it could as well be called a number processor). A      knowledgeable salesperson can explain the capabilities of      each and help you anticipate your needs.    </p>    <h3>      COMPUTER MEMORY    </h3>    <p>      If you're going to be using your computer for one of the      more serious applications-which involve processing      and sometimes storing data-you'll need to know about      computer memory. There are essentially two types: permanent      and temporary.    </p>    <p>      Permanent memory usually refers to the amount of      information that can be stored on a program diskette. These      plastic packages-which measure about 1/8" thick and      5-1/4" square-contain a round platter coated with      magnetic material, usually iron oxide. This material      records electrical impulses that the computer can recognize      as program information. The maximum amount of data a      diskette is able to store varies, depending on the make and      model of computer.    </p>    <p>      Temporary memory will probably be the more important of the      two types for your purposes. It resides inside the computer      in an area called RAM (Random Access Memory), and is so      named because it has no particular pattern to it. This      memory is managed by the computer itself-you have no      direct control over it-and is used to store bits of      information as a program executes.    </p>    <p>      Let's say, for instance, that your software program lets      you enter a sequence of numbers from the keyboard (it could      be anything from a phone number list to the amounts on      checks you've written). The numbers will undoubtedly be      used in a subsequent process, but for the time being they      just need to be put somewhere. So the computer places them      in RAM. As the numbers are needed, the computer fetches      them from the temporary memory and plugs them into the      program.    </p>    <p>      Some programs require more memory than others, and it's      usually information-processing software that requires the      most. So when you're shopping for a computer, keep in mind      the memory needs of the programs you plan to      use-specifications are printed right on the software      package-and make sure that the machine can meet the      requirements. In the case of some computers, such as the      IBM PC <em>jr,</em> RAM memory is expandable. The machine      comes with the minimum complement of RAM, to which you can      add more memory cells, up to a certain maximum set by the      machine. Other computers, however, are limited to a set      amount of RAM.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Video Monitors    </h3>    <p>      <em>Most computers, you      will find, come      without a display      screen . . . yet you      can't do much without      one. Fortunately,      almost all home      computers are      designed to be used      with a television set.      Inside the computer is      a device called an RF      modulator that      converts the signals      from the computer      into television      frequencies (usually channel 3 or 4). A      connector ties the      computer to the      antenna terminals of      the television receiver.      By tuning the      television to the      appropriate channel,      you'll get a computer      display. . . and if it's a      color TV, you will, in      most cases, get a      color display.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Unfortunately,      televisions weren't      designed to be      computer monitors      -their bandwidth is too      narrow. So, computers      display better on a      specially designed      monitor than they do      on a TV. And      computers such as the      Apple llc don't display      well at all on a      television. In lieu of      using a TV for display,      then, you'll have to      buy a computer      monitor. Depending on      whether you choose      monochrome (black      and white) or color,      this will cost between      $100 and $500.</em>    </p>		</div>    <h3>      WHERE TO BUY    </h3>    <p>      Once you've decided which computer to buy, your next hurdle      is to find a place to purchase it. This can be trickier      than it sounds, because many retailers who used to carry      computers have found that the profit margins are no longer      great enough to warrant stocking them. Your neighborhood      computer store probably handles mostly businessoriented      machines with capabilities and prices beyond your wants. Of      the computers listed in the chart that accompanies this      article, only the Apple IIc and the IBM PC <em>jr</em>      (both of which are at the upper end of the price range) can      be widely found in computer stores. The Radio Shack Color      Computer, of course, is sold through that company's chain      of stores.    </p>    <p>      Major department store chains are a good source of home      computers, though you can't expect to do much bargaining.      Look for sales to avoid paying full ticket price. Discount      outlets, such as K-Mart, also have computers on hand this      time of year, and they're likely to be heavily discounted.    </p>    <p>      Mail-order houses are often the lowest-price outlets for      computers. In fact, MOTHER NO. 95 had an advertisement from      a wholesale liquidator selling a $1,000 computing system      for only $488. You should always be careful when buying      through the mail, but I've checked out this particular      advertiser personally and can guarantee that you would get      just what is promised. The computer itself is a      discontinued model made by one of the manufacturers      mentioned in this article. In too many cases, however, you      have to read the small print very carefully to see if the      product being offered is the genuine article or a      reasonable facsimile (see the sidebar "Compatibles") and if      the system is actually complete.    </p>    <p>      The main disadvantages of buying at discount outlets or      through the mail are that you'll receive little or no      assistance in learning to use the machine, and that in most      cases you'll be on your own in finding service after the      sale. A good local dealer-ask other people who own      computers which dealers are knowledgeable-can be      worth paying extra money for.    </p>    <p>      An interesting approach that's becoming more popular these      days is co-op buying. Computer-buying co-ops work just like      any other cooperative-people band together to      purchase in bulk at a reduced price. This is to the      advantage of the manufacturer, retailer, and customer      alike. To find out if there's a buying co-op near you,      check with computer clubs, which can be located through      dealers in the area.    </p>    <p>      You could also consider trying to buy secondhand,      but-oddly enough-used computers aren't all that      easy to find. Most people seem to affectionately hang on to      their old computers when they upgrade, as if that old      system were some long-standing relative. <em>What's more,      those who do part with their</em> old computers often do so      because they've been having problems with      them-difficulties that you'd prefer not to inherit.      In the home computer category, the main unit should      probably be bought new. Peripherals such as printers and      monitors, however, can be found used, often at significant      savings.    </p>    <p>      When choosing a home computer, the software is at least as      important as the hardware. You don't want to buy a      computer-no matter how inexpensive-that has      little software written for it; you also want to be sure      that the machine has enough memory to run the software      that's available for it. The final choice will usually be a      compromise between your needs (and wants) and your      finances.    </p>    <h3>      Compatibles    </h3>    <p>      <em>You'll often run across the expression</em> compatible      <em>when you're shopping for a computer. What is a      compatible? Basically it's a copy of a popular computer.      Not an exact copy, mind you-that would be      illegal-but a reasonable facsimile. These imitators      are often worth pursuing because they're less expensive.      The most copied personal computer is the IBM PC, the      machine that put the computer revolution into high gear. As      a testimony to its achievements, no less than 20 IBM      compatibles are available today, most of which sell for      around two-thirds of what the genuine article costs. Some      are duplicates (even down to the placement of the logo);      others-such as Compaq-imitate IBM only at the      software level. Some could be said to be superior to the      original . . . others are clearly inferior.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In all instances, however, the compatible is supposed      to run the same software that the original handles. In      fact, the crux of the issue</em> is software compatibility.      <em>It's far more important for the compatible to act like      the original than to look like it.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>When shopping for a compatible, keep in mind that      compatibility can be a relative term. Some differences do      exist (because of copyright laws), and some software      written for the original may not run on a particular      compatible. Let's hope it's not yours!</em>    </p>    <h3>      Computer Software    </h3>    <p>      <em>The question most people ask when the topic of home      computers comes up is "What practical purpose do they      serve?" As I already mentioned, MOTHER will, in</em> fu      <em>ture issues, be discussing some of the software that      may be of interest to her readers. But to give you a better      idea of what to expect, MOTHER's staffers have reviewed a      couple of pieces of gardening software: ORTHO'S      COMPUTERIZED GARDENING and Home & Hobby Software's      PLANTIN' PAL.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>ORTHO'S COMPUTERIZED GARDENING is a two-sided disk and      book package that has two main features: a personalized      plant selector to help you choose-by zip code,      height, bloom, light needs, etc.-the right landscape      plants or houseplants for you (OCG does</em> not <em>deal      with vegetables) .. . and a calendar recordkeeping aid. The      plant selector is excellent: You tell the computer what      requirements you have, and it shows you all the plants in      its 750-entry master list that will work in your region,      along with their caretaking needs. The calendar is limited      by the fact that you can read only one day's entry at a      time. COMPUTERIZED GARDENING comes in versions for IBM,      Commodore 64, and Apple (11e, 11c, and MacIntosh) computers      and costs $49.95 plus $3.00 shipping and handling from      Ortho Information Services, 575 Market St., San Francisco,      CA 94105. Recommended only for computerphiles who have real      plant/ landscaping needs.</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>PLANTIN' PAL, on the other hand, deals with vegetable      gardening. Its intent is to help you lay out your year's      garden. Using an actual garden map and crop      symbols-all of which you can print out to      keep-PP helps you determine how much space you'll      need for each of 40 crops (based on how many people you're      feeding and whether or not you want to store the crop as      well as eat it fresh). It can even incorporate companion      planting. PAL costs $29.95 postpaid from Home & Hobby      Software, Inc., 4936 Morgan Ave. South, Minneapolis, MN      55409; in versions for IBM PC/PCjr, Apple</em> <em>II+/IIe,      and Commodore 64. The program allows you to juggle crops to      find the perfect plan for your plot. It is, however,      somewhat limited in that it presumes you'll use a wide-row      garden (20" rows, 16" paths) and that it doesn't really      incorporate succession plantings.</em>    </p>
