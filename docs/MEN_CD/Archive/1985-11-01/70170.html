                    <p>      This year, give presents as warm and personal as the aroma      of your own holiday kitchen.    </p>        <p>      Gifts of food at Christmas are traditional in many      families, and for good reason. Since almost everyone loves      to eat, the giver can rest assured that such presents will      be welcomed-not stored in the attic until the next      garage sale. Furthermore, preparing home-cooked gifts in a      snug, fragrant kitchen is at least as much fun as coping      with crowded malls and slushy streets. And best of all, a      homemade gift embodies the warmth and affection that are      among the loveliest ornaments of the Christmas      season.<br />      <br />      The only problem is, when a number of gifts of perishable      food all arrive in the same week, there's often more than      anyone can use. So why not add a measure of flexibility to      this year's culinary offerings? Choose a recipe that you      like . . . measure out the herbs and spices that provide      its distinctive flavor . . . wrap them up with a festive      ribbon . . . attach a copy of the recipe . . . and present      your holiday-harried friends with a gift they can enjoy at      their convenience. All they have to do is add a few of      their own ingredients, follow your simple directions, and      savor your (almost) home cooking.<br />      <br />      If you have dried, homegrown herbs from last summer's      garden, your gift will be even more personal and      flavorful-and very economical, too. If not, you may      the necessary store-bought ingredients in your pantry.      (Keep in mind, though, that herbs and spices lose much of      their flavor after a few months; if your tarragon has been      hanging around since last Easter, get a new jar.) And even      if you do have to purchase the makings for your seasoning      packets, you'll still wind up with relatively inexpensive      gifts-especially when you consider the prices of many      of the made-for-Christmas trinkets that litter the store      shelves and lure last-minute shoppers.<br />      <br />      You may have some favorite recipes that would lend      themselves to seasoning packets. But, to get you started,      here are five suggestions from MOTHER's staff.<br />      <br />      Mulled Wine is a wonderful Christmas beverage; as it heats,      it fills the house with the aromas of cinnamon and cloves.      You can give the spice packet alone or tie one on a gift      bottle of wine. Our Herb and Fruit Stuffing mix will please      any busy holiday cook, either by itself or if given in the      company of a loaf of homemade bread. Herbed Rice is a fine      accompaniment to chicken or leftover turkey; one packet      will flavor enough rice for several meals, and you can even      premix the seasonings with portions of uncooked rice for      just-add-water-and-serve preparation. MOM's Super Seasoning      is an all-purpose blend of herbs and Parmesan cheese for      sprinkling on steamed vegetables, tossed salads, and baked      potatoes (in place of fatladen butter and sour cream). And,      finally, the Herb Salad Dressing mix, when added to oil and      vinegar, will liven up wintertime greens.<br />      <br />      So put on some Christmas music . . . pour yourself a cup of      hot cider . . . and start mixing!    </p>
