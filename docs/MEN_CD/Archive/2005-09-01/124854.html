        Twenty-seven years ago, I had a Dutch elm tree on our farm inOrange County, Ind. It was about 15 inches in diameter and stoodabout 100 feet from our house where we had a swing in its shade.One morning, a redheaded woodpecker took some dead bark off a limb,and I realized the tree was dying from Dutch elm disease. But I hadan idea to save it. My father kept a can of pure gum turpentine andsaid it was good to put on an animal's cuts and scratches to keepflies away. I thought it might work on the elm tree.<br /><br />I drilled a 1-inch-diameter hole into the tree about a half inchdeep and screwed an 18-inch, L-shaped pipe into the hole. (To makethe L, use a 1-inch-diameter pipe 2 inches long, threaded at bothends, an elbow and an 18-inch, 1-inch-diameter pipe.) I pouredabout a cup of turpentine into the pipe and put a cork into theend. A week later, I checked the pipe and all the turpentine haddrained into the tree. I unscrewed the pipe and put a cork into thehole and covered that with turpentine.<br /><br />We moved a few years later, but recently I returned with myson-in-law to visit the farm. There was the tree, 3 feet indiameter and about 75 feet tall, healthy as can be! I guess my dadwas right about turpentine keeping insects away.<br /><br />Be sure the pipe fits tightly into the hole so no turpentine leaksout and always use pure gum turpentine. If the tree starts to dieagain, give it another dose.
