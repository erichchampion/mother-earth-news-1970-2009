                <h3>      GARDEN & YARD</h3>         <h5 id="byline">      BY GAIL DAMEROW</h5>     <p>      <strong>The Ultimate Low-Cost, Chemical-Free Pest      Control</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Like officious little men in baggy gray suits, the      guinea fowl scuttle up and down our driveway. Since dawn,      they've been scouring our orchard for beetles, locusts,      spiders, and ticks. Now they are ready to patrol our yard      and garden for ants, cockroaches, flies, wasps, termites,      cutworms, grubs, and snails. The guinea fowl are relentless      in their pursuit...</em>    </p>    <p>      I can remember a time when my husband and I had no guineas.      Our former flock had roosted in trees and nested on the      ground where, one by one, they had fallen prey to owls and      foxes. While we were guinea-less, our potato crop was      denuded by potato beetles, our hibiscus hedge was decimated      by locusts, and we lost several fruit trees to flat-head      borers. We soon realized that our "little gray men" had      given us far more than just a pleasant diversion (and      occasional good eating). So we got a new crew to work our      land, and I hope never to live without these little guys      again.    </p>    <h3>Helmeted Little Soldiers</h3>     <p>      Many people have never seen, much less heard of, guinea      fowl. Visitors, on spying their first guinea, invariably      ask "What is that - a turkey?" Nope, but not a bad      guess. Like turkeys, guineas are <em>Galliformes</em> , a      group encompassing all chicken-like birds. But while      chickens are members of the pheasant family, turkeys and      guineas each have a family of their own. Native to Africa,      they are known for traveling in large, gregarious flocks.      Guinea fowl were introduced into Europe by 15th century      Portuguese explorers, and then arrived in North America      with the early settlers. There are seven species of guinea      fowl, of which the "helmeted pearl" is by far the most      common, and certainly the weirdest looking, with its oddly      shaped helmet, white, featherless face, bright red wattles,      and gray polka-dotted feathers.    </p>                <p>      Ask those who keep guineas why they have them and you'll      get a different answer every time. Chicken and turkey      farmers keep them to ward off poultry-eating predators.      Ranchers turn them loose to discourage rattlers and      copperheads. Country dwellers like the way they gobble down      disease-carrying ticks. Orchardists use them to drive off      marauding birds. Farmers put them to work patrolling for      row crop pests. Guineas do all this without damaging crops.      Sure, they'll take the occasional peck at a cultivated      plant, but they much prefer insects, weeds, and seeds.    </p>    <p>      Free-ranging guineas spend most of their days foraging.      They work as a team, marching chest to chest and devouring      anything they startle as they move through the grass. When      they discover a special treat - a rodent, for      example, or a small snake - they close ranks, circle      their prey, and move in for the feast. All the while, they      keep up a steady stream of whistles, chirps, and clicks, a      sort of running commentary on the day's hunt.    </p>    <p>      But these little foragers have their faults. Like chickens,      guineas are natural-born scratchers - I once watched      a week-old guinea scratch vigorously in a saucer of starter      mash while others stood by trying to catch bits of mash      sailing through the air. Nevertheless, a guinea doesn't      scratch as enthusiastically or as persistently as a      chicken, and is far less likely to dig up garden seedlings.      Although they are attracted to freshly worked soil and will      spend hours digging holes for luxurious dustbaths. Once I      acquired a whole flock of guineas simply by arriving on the      scene moments after they had devastated a friend's      blossoming snap beans.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the minor inconveniences caused by dusting      and occasional scratching, guineas have other      characteristics that some people find somewhat less than      endearing. For one thing, the hens lay only seasonally, and      the young are quite delicate. Guineas are also a noisy      bunch, making them a poor choice where high-strung      neighbors live nearby. Because of their continuous      conversations, guineas cannot be snuck into housing      developments as chickens often are. It's probably best      because guineas don't take kindly to confinement; they much      prefer the freedom to prowl their home base. In this      respect, a guinea has the same independence as a barn-born      cat - it'll eat your food and tolerate your presence,      but a guinea will never be your best friend.    </p>    <h3>Hardly Any Trouble At All</h3>    <p>      Maybe you can't pal around with these guys, but they're a      heck of a lot less trouble than other fowl. Because guineas      prefer freedom to regimentation, they have not been      commercially exploited and "improved" as have chickens and      turkeys. The happy result is that, while these other fowl      have become less resistant to disease, free-ranging guineas      remain almost entirely disease-free. Also, guinea fowl      adapt readily to all but the severest climates (although      they strongly dislike snow).    </p>    <p>      In most areas, a shelter is not essential against the      weather, however (as I learned the hard way) a rudimentary      shelter is a good way to provide night-time protection from      predators such as dogs, coyotes, foxes, and owls. The      shelter need only be a simple three-sided, south-facing      shed with a wire front and a draft-free perch toward the      back, offering seven inches of roosting space per bird. A      flock fed late in the day under the roof will be encouraged      to stay the night. If you prefer to pen your guineas,      instead of letting them come and go as they please, you      should allow for at least 30 square feet per dozen birds.      Cover the pen with wire netting, or pinion your guineas to      keep them from flying out. (Pinioning involves clipping off      the last joint of one wing, at the thumb, when birds are      less than one week old.) Never pinion free-ranging guineas      or they won't be able to fly away from predators.    </p>    <p>      Feeding is perhaps the easiest part of caring for your      fowl. A range-fed flock fulfills most of its own dietary      needs, requiring little more from you than fresh water and      a handful of mixed grains to entice them indoors at night.      When forage is scarce during fall and winter, up the grain      ration a bit. Feed penned guineas commercially prepared lay      ration designed for chickens, except during breeding      season. One dozen guineas will eat approximately two pounds      per day. To improve laying, switch to higher-protein turkey      or gamebird ration (if available) in February.    </p>        <h3>Egg Laying and Casual Mating</h3>    <p>      A domestic guinea hen lays seasonally, just as her wild      cousins do. Some time between March and May, when she is 26      to 28 weeks old, an average hen will lay about 100 eggs.      She will continue laying that number each year until she is      five-years-old (or even older). Her eggs will be      light-brown, sometimes speckled, with shells that are three      times tougher than the shells of chicken eggs. Guinea eggs      have a sharper point than chicken eggs have, and they're      smaller (three guinea eggs roughly equals two chicken      eggs).    </p>    <p>      Hens lay in late morning or early afternoon and prefer to      steal a nest in some secluded spot rather than lay in any      fine nest you provide. If you confine your hens until      they've finished laying for the day, you won't have to hunt      for their eggs. But even when confined, most hens shun      nests and deposit their eggs on the floor. Egg fertility is      rarely a serious problem. If you keep one cock for every      four or five hens, you can expect nearly 100 percent      fertility (as long as the cocks are three years old or      less).    </p>    <p>      Often I am asked if a guinea will mate with a chicken. Yes,      casual mating does occur, but it's infrequent, and the rare      cross-bred offspring (which are sometimes described as      looking like vultures) are usually sterile. An interesting      side note: Guineas that are raised among chickens are tamer      than guineas that are not, and they are easier to entice      indoors at night.    </p>        <h3>      Love and Other Fowl Relationships    </h3>    <p>      One of the most surprising things about guinea fowl is the      strong attachment that develops between a guinea cock and      his hens. If separated during feeding, a hen and cock will      run toward each other to reunite like long lost lovers.      It's quite a sight. And while a hen is on the nest, her      mate will stand guard, creating an enormous ruckus if he      senses oncoming danger. I'll never forget the day when one      of my hens was carried off by a fox - her mate spent      several days looking and calling for her.    </p>    <p>      Although hens are protective of their babies, their      frenzied pace can make them seem like neglectful mothers.      Guinea eggs take between 26 to 28 days to hatch, and      mothers are tenacious setters at this time. Once the first      few eggs have hatched however, the hens pretty much are off      and running. When they take off, they travel too far and      too fast for the little fellows to keep up. Many times the      mothers will lead their little offspring right through dewy      grass, causing them to chill. This should explain why most      guinea keepers use an incubator or a broody chicken for      hatching.    </p>    <h3>Poorman's Pheasant</h3>        <p>      Guinea is often called "poorman's pheasant" because it      tastes similar to pheasant, at considerably less cost. And      even though it sells for about half the price of pheasant,      guinea is still considered a luxury food. You can find it      on the menus of upscale French and Oriental restaurants,      especially on the East Coast.    </p>    <p>      Guinea meat is darker and richer tasting than chicken, and      it contains less fat and fewer calories. Guineas are also      smaller-boned than chickens, but have heavier breasts,      making them meatier than they look. The average bird      dresses out to 75 percent of its live weight - five      percent more than the 70 percent average for a broiler      chicken.    </p>    <p>      Beecause a mature hen weighs three pounds and a mature cock      weighs four pounds, you can expect a maximum table-ready      weight of two and 1/4 to three pounds. Like the meat of      chickens and other birds, the meat of a mature guinea cock      is not nearly as tasty as the meat of a hen. Because a      bird's breastbone gets stiffer as the bird matures, you can      tell a guinea is still prime for eating by the flexibility      of its breastbone.    </p>    <p>      Young guinea is the most tender and flavorful of all. The      best meat comes from 12-week-old keets weighing about two      pounds. The giant guinea, a hybrid developed for the meat      market, reaches twice that weight in the same amount of      time. Butcher and dress a guinea as you would a chicken.      Chill the meat quickly and store it (loosely covered) in      the coldest part of the refrigerator for up to two days. If      you then wish to freeze the bird to cook later, pack it      tightly in plastic wrap and seal it in a plastic bag      designed for freezer storage. The meat will keep for six      months in the freezer, and up to one week in the freezer      compartment of the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Succulent young guinea may be broiled, roasted, or fried.      Because the meat of an older hen is lean and dry, the      traditional way to roast a hen is to wrap it in a blanket      of bacon and roast it uncovered at 350° F for about 45      minutes until the meat is tender. To brown the skin, remove      the bacon toward the end of the cooking period. If you      prefer to do it without the added fat, cook a mature hen by      a moist-heat method such as braising or stewing. You might,      for example, quarter the hen and marinate it overnight in      1/2 cup apple cider or white wine combined with 1 cup hot      water, 1 small onion, and 3 crushed cloves. Drain the meat,      pat it dry, and brown it in a little butter or oil. Add one      sliced onion and 1/2 cup apple cider or dry white wine.      Cover and simmer for 30 minutes to one hour (depending on      the bird's age) until the meaty part of a leg gives when      you prick it with a fork. No matter how you prepare it,      guinea goes well with sauteed mushrooms, brown or wild      rice, and lightly steamed spinach or a fresh tossed salad.    </p>    <h3>Caring for Your Keets</h3>    <p>      A baby guinea is called a "keet" (from the old Nordic word      "cytling" or "keetling," meaning a young animal). Some      people choose to order day-old keets by mail. If you do so,      be sure to open the carton in front of the mail carrier,      just in case you have to file a claim. Chances are, though,      you'll find a healthy gang of eager little birds with      beady, black eyes and bright coral beaks and feet. If you      plan to free-range your guineas, it's a good idea to start      out with keets rather than full-grown birds. The baby      guineas become acquainted with their home ground as they      broaden their foraging range, while adult guineas are      likely to fly the coop the first chance they get.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Baby guineas are a study in<br /> perpetual motion as      they scurry<br /> about, pecking at the tip of each<br /> other's beaks      and rat-a-tatting the<br /> walls.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Keets of the dark variety look an awful lot like two-legged      chipmunks with two-tone brown stripes down their backs. The      little critters are a study in perpetual motion as they      scurry about, pecking at the tip of each other's beaks,      nipping on each other's toes, rat-a-tatting the walls, and      flapping their stubby little wings for the sheer joy of      movement. Then suddenly, as if on command, they all will      collapse into instant sleep.    </p>    <p>      Because they are so small and delicate, keets can be easily      trampled or drowned during their critical first two weeks      of life. To avoid losing any, keep the keets uncrowded.      When they reach three weeks of age, move them into larger      facilities offering at least one square foot of space per      bird. By the time keets are one-month-old, they develop      their first set of feathers. In the pearl variety, these      feathers will be camouflage-brown. Later, gray feathers      will appear, letting you know your keets are ready to fend      for themselves on the open range.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>How to Grab a Guinea</h3>     <p>      One good reason to house guineas indoors (at least at      night) is so you can catch them easier there than in the      tree tops. The best time to catch a guinea is after dark,      but even then you have to be quick. If you swipe and miss,      you may end up with a handful of feathers and one wary,      semi-nude bird.    </p>    <p>      Never catch a guinea by its legs, as you would a chicken.      If you manage to get hold of only one leg, the bird will      whip around like an eggbeater and possibly break a bone.      The correct way to catch a guinea is to clap both hands      against its wings. Once caught, carry the bird by its      strong wings, never by its brittle legs. And hold on tight      - even though a guinea would rather walk than fly, if      one gets away from you, it'll fly like a bird.    </p></div>    <p>      Raise no more than two dozen keets when you're first      starting out. They are tiny and quick to escape through      wire mesh as fine as one-half inch, making tight facilities      a must. The ideal small-scale brooder is a stout cardboard      box lined for the first few days with paper towels, and      later with dried wood shavings, to keep the keets clean,      warm, and dry. Heat the brooder with an ordinary light      bulb, screwed into a reflector. Raise or lower the light to      adjust the degree of warmth, letting the birds' comfort be      your guide. If they are unhappy, you'll know - their      persistent, shrill cries will make you think you've been      invaded by a horde of angry crickets. You'll also know when      keets are content by their musical "me-too, me-too" call.    </p>    <p>      As for feeding your keets, try a 21 to 23 percent protein      ration consisting of either commercial turkey starter or      mashed hard-boiled eggs mixed with cottage cheese and a      little cornmeal (or oatmeal). After four weeks, switch to      18 percent grower ration, or a mixture of cracked corn and      whole wheat supplemented with young grass clippings,      chopped lettuce, and other fresh greens. And of course,      always provide water.    </p>    <h3>Deciphering Sexes and Sounds</h3>     <p>      It isn't easy to tell which keets are cocks and which are      hens until they are about eight-weeks-old. Then one day,      the hens will start sounding their characteristic      two-syllable cry, "comeback, comeback," which some folks      often hear as "good-luck, good-luck:" Guinea cocks, on the      other hand, call with a series of one-syllable sounds,      "chi-chi-chi-chichi," followed by a harsh "chrrrr." They      sound so much like the buzz of a chainsaw that, one winter,      a neighbor's lonely hen took to chattering at my husband      whenever he cut firewood. A hen, when upset or angry, may      call like a cock, but a cock will never call like a hen.    </p>    <p>      At maturity, cocks and hens have identical plumage. Cocks,      however, are slightly larger. The red wattles dangling      beneath their chins are slightly bigger and cup away more      from their necks. Cocks also have larger helmets that stand      up straighter than the hens: Still, helmet size and other      sexual differences are quite subtle. My first "pair" of      guineas was purchased from a supposedly experienced breeder      who was selling one of two mated pairs, and who was later      red-faced as she asked to exchange one of my hens for one      of her cocks. That first pair, when we finally sorted them      out, brought me nothing but good luck, good luck, good      luck. Now, I can't imagine life without guinea fowl. They      are an invaluable source of chemical-free pest control and      a source of endless entertainment.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note:</em> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> <em>contributor      Gail Damerow and her guineas live on a small farm in      Tennessee.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Resources:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stock</strong>    </p>    <p>      Ralph Winter (21357 White Pine Lane, New Vienna, Iowa      52065, (319/853-4195) carries a variety of colors in      addition to white and pearl.
