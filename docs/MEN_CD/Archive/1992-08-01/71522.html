                    <p>      <strong>Learn how to graft apple trees and grow the      old-time varities.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Katherine C. Rhee    </h5>    <p>      Sweetbough, Black Gilliflower, Sops of Wine, Adam's Pearain      - these old apple varieties were introduced to our      country by the first settlers from France and England.      American farmers selected the most vigorous and      disease-resistant of these seedlings to grow in their own      orchards, and anxiously awaited their first autumn harvest.    </p>        <p>      After examining their bounty, farmers found that although      the apples were small and roughlooking, they nevertheless      held an aromatic smell and a tart, crisp taste. Then in the      late 1700s, New York and New England farmers found that by      experimenting with their farming methods, they could make      all sorts of new varieties. And they did. Thanks to these      inventive apple breeders, we were blessed with a dizzying      variety of apples to choose from.    </p>    <p>      Only you won't find too many of the old-fashioned apples in      supermarkets today. Sadly, these apples are getting harder      and harder to find. They haven't vanished altogether,      though - people who find modern apples as boring as      boiled potatoes are on a mission to bring these old      varieties back by grafting and replanting them in their own      orchards and gardens.    </p>    <p>      Now if you're planning to grow old varieties of apples in      your own orchard, understand that almost all of these are      complex hybrids, which means their seeds won't grow up to      be anything like the parent tree. So in order to reproduce      a particular variety of apples, a nurseryperson must take a      piece of that grafting stock and graft it onto another tree      (the rootstock). Thanks to grafting techniques, it has been      possible to keep old-time apple varieties true-to-parent      for centuries.    </p>    <p>      Today there are retail nurseries which carry grafted trees      of old apple varieties, particularly the Mailing series      (see "Where to Order" for a list of nurseries and their      addresses). It's really quite simple to produce your own      grafted trees, and you can do it for next to nothing      (except, of course, for an expenditure of time and      patience) if you grow your own seedling rootstock and      collect grafting stock from your favorite wild or abandoned      trees.    </p>    <p>      Most people do their actual grafting during the winter, but      there's plenty of planning to do over the fall. First,      you'll have to select which types of rootstocks you want to      use. It's not a bad idea (and plenty of fun) to go around      to different orchards and fruitstands this fall to do a      little taste-testing.    </p>    <p>      There are a few different ways you can go about it. You can      graft onto an apple tree which is already growing on your      place. If you want small, early-bearing trees, or      extra-hardy ones for your orchard, you can buy special      rootstock. Or if you want named varieties of apples, like      the types described in the table, grafting stock can be      purchased by mail order. For the price of four or five      conventional apple trees, you can buy rootstock and      grafting stock for an orchard of 50 trees of the most      unique and choice sorts!    </p>    <p>      The biggest advantage to growing seedling rootstock is that      you have the chance to select the most vigorous and hardy      seedlings. However, think about timing - it takes a      lot longer to grow bearing trees from seeds than from other      methods.    </p>    <p>      To start, remove the seeds from any fully ripened fruit. (A      helpful hint: Take the seeds and drop them into a bowl of      water; the ones that sink are the ones most likely to grow      well.) Once you've removed the seeds, chill them for eight      to 10 weeks, then mix the seeds with moist peat moss and      keep them in a dark place at about 35°F. (Presumably,      the chilling could be done in a refrigerator if you don't      have a cold cellar.)    </p>    <p>      Now as soon as the ground can be worked in the spring,      plant the seeds about one inch deep and one foot apart. The      vegetable garden is a good place to start the seeds,      because they are likely to get the weeding and other      attention they need. At the end of the first growing      season, remove the least vigorous ones; the next spring,      remove any that were damaged by cold over the winter. When      the trees are 3/8 inch in diameter at ground level (usually      at about two years old), they are large enough for      grafting.    </p>    <p>      Since a rootstock and the material grafted onto it becomes      one single organism, the two parts naturally affect each      other. The rootstock influences such things as the ultimate      size of the tree, its hardiness, the age at which it comes      into bearing, and the heaviness of the crop. Some of the      most popular types are the dwarfing and semi-dwarfing      strains of the Malling series, developed in England. They      produce smaller trees, but full-sized fruit. Many Malling      rootstock also bring trees into bearing at an earlier age.      Be forewarned that some rootstock and grafting stocks are      incompatible with each other, and the grafts may not take,      or they might succumb to infection. One way to handle this      is to use two different rootstocks.    </p>    <p>      If your orchard site isn't ready, you can plant your      rootstock trees in rows at the back of your vegetable      garden. Then after the season goes by, just transplant them      to the orchard. For example, my rootstock was planted in      our garden in Maine, grafted there in August, and then      shipped to our new home in Nova Scotia in early November,      where they were immediately planted. All survived and grew      happily the following season.    </p>    <p>      We collected all of our grafting stock from three sources.      We used the old apple trees from our first place in the      country, which held enormous sentimental value for us. We      perpetuated two huge, nearly dead trees which bore      delicious fruit, one russet and the other golden. Then we      found a friendly orchardist in a nearby apple-growing      region, a delightful man in his 80s, who knew the history      of every tree in his orchard. He told us about the many old      variety trees that he owned and planned to replace -      Kings, Russets, Ben Davises, Spys, and Wageners.    </p>    <p>      We bought several different kinds of apples that fall,      decided which ones we liked best, and then returned for      more the next fall. When we asked the old orchardist to      sell us some wonderful grafting stock, he was notably      pleased with our interest and presented them to us with his      best wishes.    </p>               <h3>      The Grafting Principle    </h3>    <p>      Before getting into the specific techniques of grafting,      it's helpful to understand the principle that lies behind      it. Only one cell layer of a tree's branch or trunk is      capable of healing a wound. This layer, which lies between      the bark and the wood, is called the <em>cambium.</em> The      principle of grafting is simply: 1) to cut bud-bearing      pieces off of the parent tree in such a way as to expose      the maximum amount of cambium, and then 2) to attach this      piece to a place on the new tree where a large amount of      cambium has also been exposed.    </p>    <p>      Where the two cambiums touch, the cells will multiply and      fuse the two pieces into one organism. If the two cambiums      don't touch, the part which was put onto the new tree will      die, and the tree will just heal over the wound. Therefore,      it's essential to put the grafted material in the right      place, and to bind the graft tightly to keep it there.    </p>    <h3>      T-bud Grafting    </h3>    <p>      When it comes to dealing with young trees, try T-bud      grafting. It is quick and provides greater chance for      success than other grafting methods. It is also the method      of choice when you plan to raise your own seedling      rootstock or grow dwarf trees.    </p>    <h3>      <em>CUTTING AND WRAPPING YOUR STOCK</em>    </h3>    <p>      The first step to T-bud grafting is cutting your stock, in      this case called <em>budsticks.</em> A budstick is a      terminal shoot which is about the thickness of a pencil.      You can test for bud maturity by pulling downwards on a      leaf in the middle of a shoot. Buds are a good age for      grafting when the leaf stem will come off cleanly, without      tearing. As soon as you cut the budstick of the tree,      remove the top of the shoot and the leaves, leaving about      1/4 inch of each leaf's stem to use later as a handle.    </p>    <p>      Wrap the bottoms of the budsticks in moist material and      keep them in plastic bags. If they dry out, so will the      buds; so do your grafting as soon as possible. Although      grafting is generally done over winter, some people prefer      to graft in August, when the bark of the rootstock slips      easily from the wood underneath.    </p>    <p>      Make a T-shaped cut through the rootstock's bark at least      four inches above the ground, by pressing the bark with a      knife. Make your cuts quickly and smoothly with a very      sharp knife (ripped or bruised tissue may not heal, and if      you make the cut on the north side of the tree, the graft      will be less likely to dry out). With your knife blade,      lift the flaps that you've just made in order to loosen      them, and then cut a bud shield from your budstick. (Don't      use fruit buds because they'll bloom in the spring instead      of making a shoot right away.)    </p>    <p>      Now starting just below the bud, make your cut just deeply      enough to remove a little wood. Then, holding the bud      shield by the leaf-stem handle, slip it into the T on the      rootstock. Cut off the part of the shield that extends      above the top of the T and wrap the graft tightly with a      few rubber strips to keep the two parts moist and in close      contact.    </p>    <p>      Several kinds of strips are available for wrapping,      including ones with staples for attaching the loose end      after wrapping. I find the plain strips are easiest and      most secure; the loose end is just tucked underneath the      wrapping. Two strips may be necessary to wrap the graft,      thought it's not necessary to cover up the whole area. (The      bud shouldn't be covered.) Eventually your strips will rot      off. Try to graft several buds on each tree to be sure that      at least one will take. My husband and I found it easiest      and most efficient to work separately. We budded 50 trees      in about four hours.    </p>		    <p>      <em>NOW SIT BACK AND</em> <em>WATCH THEM GROW</em>    </p>    <p>      Bud grafting does take some skill - but it's quickly      developed. Those who aren't swift-and-sure knife wielders      should practice on some other material first. I went down      to our wild chokecherry thicket and spent an hour or so      grafting buds to stems, until I felt fairly confident about      the operation.    </p>    <p>      The next spring, we inspected all of our trees dozens of      times. We were ecstatic when our babies began to grow. We      cut off the tops of the trees - just above the graft      - on which a graft had taken. Doing this forces all      of the rootstock's energy into the development of that bud.      From just one bud, a whole tree will eventually grow. The      rootstock will make buds, shoots, and suckers, too, which      must be pinched off as they form. If two grafts took on one      tree, one will have to be cut off. This causes me the same      kind of pain I feel when thinning a row of vegetable      seedlings; but like thinning, I know it is essential for      the health of the plant. We procrastinated a little before      cutting out the extra shoots just in case any were injured.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes it takes a while for a bud to swell, even after      the rootstock branches have opened their leaves. Their will      to survive, however, is amazing - on a few of our      trees, a bud had died or been knocked off during the      winter, and from underneath it another bud grew and became      a shoot. So don't be surprised if you are happier with your      new orchard in June than in April. Still, you can expect      anywhere from 30 to 90% of your T-bud grafts to take. On      our trees, about 66% took, and 23 out of 25 trees were      successfully grafted on the first try. It's a good idea to      tie each shoot to a stake to help it grow upright. Now all      you have to do is take good care of your little trees, and      in three or four years you'll be picking your first fruit.    </p>    <h3>      Chip Budding    </h3>    <p>      Also called plate budding, this is another ancient      technique which has only recently become the preferred      method of grafting. Despite the fact that it is extremely      simple in procedure, it is probably the most effective      method of grafting available to us today.    </p>    <p>      The first step is to take the stock you have chosen and      wipe it clean. Then, firmly hold the rootstock and make a      downward cut in the side of the stock. You should hold your      knife so that the bottom of the cut is horizontal at its      base. Then make a second cut (one or two inches long)      downward which will include the tiny bud shield. When your      two different cuts meet, the little piece of stock will      fall off. (You can just throw this away.) That new space is      where the new prepared stock will fit in.    </p>    <p>      When you are making ties with this method, make sure they      are firm. Also, if the bud is very prominent, you can make      your tie right over the bud. If it's not, you can cover the      area with thin plastic strips. Coat your ties with wax when      using twine or thread. Then seal the whole area again with      plastic or waxed tape. And that's all there is to it.    </p>      <h3>      Scion Grafting    </h3>    <p>      Scion (pronounced <em>SY-un</em> ) grafting is another      technique, in which the grafting stock, or scion, is a      shoot with several buds. It may be grafted to either a      branch of a big tree or the trunk of a small rootstock.      Scion wood is also a pencil-size terminal shoot developed      during the current growing season. It may be collected in      the fall, after the leaves are off, and stored in a cool      (35°F) cellar in a box of moist leaves, sand, or moss.      Or scion wood can be cut in early spring, just before      grafting. However, there is the risk of using wood that has      been winter-killed. Scion grafting is done before the buds      begin to swell, so you can't tell whether the scion is      alive unless you make a tiny nick in the bark with your      fingernail to be sure that the underlying tissue is green.    </p>    <p>      In <em>whip and tongue</em> grafting, the scion and      rootstock (or branch) are exactly the same size and      specially cut to lock together. Or scions can be inserted      into branches up to two inches in diameter. A three-bud      scion is used for these methods. In <em>cleft and bark</em>      grafting, use a very fine-toothed saw and cut carefully to      avoid damaging the bark of the stub. When placing a scion,      make sure that the cambiums of the scion and branch are in      contact.    </p>    <p>      All scion grafts must be sealed very well with rubber      splicing tape and emulsified asphalt or grafting wax, since      the wounds are quite large and deep. The joint must not dry      out. If you use grafting wax, you should check it every so      often during the growing season and be sure to fill in any      cracks. Two scions are usually inserted into the branch      stub in cleft and bark grafting. If they both take, one      will have to be removed. The best time to do this is at the      end of the first growing season when the grafts have      healed.    </p>    <h3>      <em>FRAMEWORKING AND TOP-WORKING</em>    </h3>    <p>      If you have a vigorous, hardy apple tree already on your      place, but wish that it bore better fruit, you can      framework it to convert the whole tree top to a new      variety. (It's better to do the work over two years or more      in order not to shock the tree.) Cut off all its branches      at a point where they are about two inches in diameter, and      using cleft, bark, or oblique side grafting, put on scions      of the desired variety. Or use smaller branches and do whip      and tongue grafting. Remove all shoots, spurs, and small      branches of the original tree top. In only a few seasons,      your tree will bear a full crop of the new kind of apple.    </p>    <p>      If you want a previously grafted tree to bear more than one      variety of apple, or if you just want to add a few      different branches to a wild apple tree, then topwork the      tree. The grafting process is the same as that for      frame-working, but less extensive. All you have to remove      from the tree are those shoots that spring up below the      graft.    </p>    <p>      All this may sound like a lot of bother to you. Perhaps it      is. But an orchard you make yourself is both satisfying and      rewarding - just wait until you take a bite of your      first home-grown!    </p>
