            		    <h5 id="byline"> by C.F. ECKHARDT</h5>      <p>      Judging from the discussion that's appeared in MOTHER's      letters column over the past couple years, it seems that a      good many folks have settled on the feeding of diatomaceous      earth as a satisfactory method of worming their livestock.    </p>    <p>      Well, I don't say that this technique won't work ... but it      scares me, and I know <em>I certainly</em> would never try      this with any animals that I valued. Diatomaceous      earth-which consists of the tiny, glasslike,      sharpedged skeletons of microscopic sea animals called      <em>diatoms</em> -works by entering the parasite's      internal system and ripping It to shreds. Who's to say It      won't do the same to your animal's digestive tract?    </p>    <p>      I know of another, <em>safer</em> method of worming      livestock ... one that my dad used for years. All it      involves is giving the afflicted animal a bit of      <em>snuff</em> in its normal ration of grain.    </p>    <p>      Why snuff? Well, if you were to read the label from a      commercial worm medicine, chances are you'd find that the      treatment consists mainly of powdered tobacco (probably 80      to 90% powdered tobacco, plus some antibiotics and      fillers). OK. So why should you pay $1.00 or $1.50 for a      half-ounce tube of <em>doctored-up tobacco</em> ... when      you can buy a four-ounce tin of Levi Garrett <em>snuff</em>      -which is nothing more than powdered tobacco      anyway-for less than a buck? Why indeed!    </p>    <p>      In my experience, snuff works as well as any worming      medicine you can get from a vat ... and It's probably a      good deal safer to use than most such medicines. To rid      your horse, cow, hog, or other large stock of parasites,      here's all you have to do: [1] Mix an ounce or so of snuff      with a scoop of feed, [2] give the mixture to your      afflicted animal, and [3] keep the beast penned up for most      of the day. Within an hour of the feeding, the animal      should begin to pass large, seething masses of stomach      worms in its feces. (When it does, sterilize the wastes by      pouring a little kerosene or used motor oil on them.)    </p>    <p>      The advantage of worming with snuff is that while the      tobacco acts to kill parasites, it's completely harmless to      livestock. (in addition, tobacco's cathartic action causes      the animal to pass the dead-and dying-worms out      of its digestive system quickly ... which is something      diatomaceous earth doesn't do.)    </p>    <p>      The kerosene (or motor oil) you pour on the infected wastes      kills any adult worms that the tobacco missed and kills the      eggs (something, again, that diatomite won't do), thus      lowering the chance of reinfestation.    </p>    <p>      In case you didn't know it, most farm animals <em>love</em>      tobacco. So don't feel bad about feeding 'am snuff ... or      even an occasional unfiltered cigarette. You'll not only      make your beasties happy, but you'll keep them worm-free      too!    </p>    <p>      (EDITOR'S NOTE: For a more complete discussion of animal      parasites and their control, see the article by R.J.      Holliday, D.V.M., in MOTHER NO. 19, pages 38-41.)    </p>
