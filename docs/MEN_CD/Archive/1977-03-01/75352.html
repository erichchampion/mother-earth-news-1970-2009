                    <p>      If you now operate-or have <em>ever</em>      operated-a successful home business that was inspired      by an article you read in MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or      less) when and where-and with how much "seed      money"-you started your venture. If your story can be      fitted into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP      BUSINESSES, you'll receive [1] the warm satisfaction of      knowing that you helped someone else find the happiness you      enjoy and [2] a free <em>two-year</em> new or renewal      subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).    </p>    <p>      Thanks to MOTHER-and to Gail Williams, who wrote the piece      ("The Best Home Typing Business of Them All", MOTHER NO.      25, pages 44-49) that pointed me in the right      direction-I now make $600 to $800 a month working at      home as a transcriber ... that is, someone who does typing      for court reporters.    </p>    <p>      Since I can't improve on Gail's write-up, I'd just like to      relate how I attained my present status as my employer's      number one typist.    </p>    <p>      First, I went to the public library (the law section) and      made a list of all the court reporters and deposition      businesses within driving distance. Then I typed up a      resume (in which I included a special note stating that I      was excellent at spelling, grammar, and punctuation) ...      and began pounding the pavement.    </p>    <p>      Everyone who interviewed me asked the same questions: [1]      Do you own your own equipment? [2] How good is your      spelling? [3] Do you live close by? [4] How often are you      willing to come in to pick up and deliver work? I told them      all that I would rent my equipment at first, that my      spelling was outstanding, and that-though our homestead is      35 miles from the city-my husband could make daily      deliveries on his way to work. Luck must have been with me,      because on my first day out I landed a job.    </p>    <p>      Right away, I arranged to rent both an IBM Selectric      typewriter and a DeJur Grundig Stenorette dictating      machine. (My total initial investment was $150 ... $35 a      month for the Selectric rental, $40 a month for the      Stenorette, and a $75 deposit.)    </p>    <p>      When I went to the office for training the next day, my      boss (I work for just one company) was patient and      thorough. He encouraged me to call any time I had a      question (which is why our phone bills-for a short      time-zoomed to $50 a month). His only caution was: "I      don't care who makes the mistakes around here, just so      they're caught before the deposition goes out the door."      Taking that to heart, I asked my fellow workers to point      out to me any errors I made. (In return, I often corrected      mistakes made by the reporters.)    </p>    <p>      During that first month, I actually <em>lost</em> money. (I      think I made about 50 cents an hour.) But-since my      deliveries were prompt and my work was accurate-I      soon found myself getting more and more to do, so that by      the end of my third month I was making $3.00 an hour.      Later-after purchasing my own equipment-my      income <em>doubled</em> .    </p>    <p>      It's now a year since I started transcribing, I'm making      $6.00 to $9.00 an hour, and yet I can still garden, bake,      and care for the children and animals. In addition, we can      now deduct a percentage of our house payments, utilities,      car costs, and gasoline from our taxes. Even better,      however, my job has allowed Ron (my husband) to return to      college for his agricultural degree.    </p>    <p>      All things considered, I wouldn't want to work any other      way. I hope other MOTHER readers will find home typing      equally rewarding.    </p>    <p>      Linda Martin<br />      Norco, Calif.    </p>    <p>      An article from MOTHER on hauling-reprinted in our      local daily newspaper three years ago-inspired my      brother and me to put our pickup trucks to work for us.    </p>    <p>      Two major facts prompted us to try what the article      suggested: [1] We live in a city of 500,000 potential      customers and [2] both of us already drive pickups. (Our      trucks had cost us only $500 each, and no further capital      investments were necessary in order for us to get started.)    </p>    <p>      We placed our first advertisement for hauling in that same      newspaper, and-though rewarded with only moderate      success In the beginning-it <em>was</em> through that      first ad that we inherited the lawnmowing and yard work      route of a deceased landscape gardener. (Landscaping was      promptly added to our list of job skills, and townmowers      with good service contracts on them were purchased for this      part of the business.)    </p>    <p>      From yard work, it was only natural that my brother and I      should progress to doing handyman jobs for our steady      lawnmowing customers ... such things as interior and      exterior painting, window washing, repairs on roofs,      foundations, and electrical systems, etc. This bit of      diversification cost us nothing, since we already owned all      the required tools.    </p>    <p>      Our family business grossed $10,000 In 1976, or $6,000      apiece. That may not sound like a lot, but we didn't spend      anything <em>close</em> to 40 hours a week at our business,      and that-for us-is what counts.    </p>    <p>      This year-with the help of a Bel Saw course-my      brother and I are adding small engine repair to our list of      job capabilities ... and this, we hope, will at least      double our current income.    </p>    <p>      Stanley B. Collopy<br />      Portland, Ore.    </p>    <p>      Five years ago I decided to leave my home near a large      Midwestern city (Cleveland, Ohio) and move to a more rural      area. But first, I wanted to find a home business that I      could depend on for a steady income before and after the      move.    </p>    <p>      I was greatly encouraged by Chuck Ferrero's "How to Make      $1,000 a Week Making Candies" article in MOTHER NO. 11      (pages 67-73), and-since I enjoy handcrafts <em>anyway</em>      -I decided to give candlemaking a try.    </p>    <p>      With $10 worth of supplies, I made a trial batch ... and      sold all of those first efforts to my friends and      co-workers! (I worked for a company that employed over 50      women, all of whom really liked the candies I brought In      ... especially since I sold them for less than half of what      they cost in local shops.) That first year, I went on to      market several hundred dollars' worth of scented candles      ... and turned a good profit in the process.    </p>    <p>      I shopped around for the best quality and most reasonable      prices in s cents, colors, and molds, and had soon acquired      [1] about $50 worth of both metal and plastic forms (which      last indefinitely) as well as [2] wax (from large oil      company warehouses) and stearic acid (from a chemical      warehouse) in bulk. As a result my profits improved, along      with the quality of my products.    </p>    <p>      I found that tall, decorator candies in various shapes and      colors are always good sellers, as are candies that are      shaped like animals (frogs, owls, turtles, and so forth). I      also did some experimenting and came up with a "beer      bottle" candle (complete with wax foaming out of the top      and down the sides) that ultimately proved to be one of my      most popular items.    </p>    <p>      When I finally made my move from the city in the summer of      1973, I set up a candlemaking operation here in Vermont and      sought out small shops that would either buy my wares or      take them on consignment. The business worked as well in      Now England as it had in the Midwest.    </p>    <p>      In conclusion, candlemaking gets my vote as a great      "sideline" business for anyone who's regularly employed but      wants to earn a little extra cash. Depending on where you      live, candlecrafting could even turn into a terrific      full-time business (even though it didn't for me).    </p>    <p>      David Poulson<br />      Rutland, Vt.    </p>
