    <p>
                 <p>      Contrary to popular belief, say Skye and Hollis Osborn and      Beverlie Beauclerk, the tropical state of Hawaii is      <em>not</em> reserved just for natives, vacationers, or the      very wealthy. Back-to-the-landers can find a place for      themselves in the Pacific paradise too. Especially if      they'll skip seven of the main islands that make up the      state ... and head straight for the biggest: Hawaii itself!    </p>        <p>      Living and growing our own on farms in Idaho and Oregon was      better than staying cooped up in some city, you understand.      But a long siege of 20-below weather a few winters back      finally chilled our enthusiasm for even the country life      ... if it had to be lived up north.    </p>    <p>      So our family of three (mother, father, and 10-year-old)      set out on a hunt for sunshine in our VW bus. And a month      later-after we'd sold the bus for plane fare-we      found it: in Honolulu, on the island of Oahu, in the state      of Hawaii.    </p>        <p>      Yes, Honolulu had sunshine all right ... and magnificent      mountains and sandy beaches to curl our toes in. But it      also had freeways, traffic, high rents, and too much      cement.    </p>    <p>      "This is no place to raise a new baby," we said (we had      just learned that our family of three was about to become      four). "And what about me?" our 10-year-old demanded. She      had a point too.    </p>    <p>      So we stored our non-essentials in three orange crates,      shouldered our packs, and began a search of our 50th      state's outer islands. Five months, two islands, and a lot      of frustrations later, we found a small house on the island      of Hawaii.    </p>    <p>      Although it was situated alongside a spectacular river and      very close to the local medicine man (who agreed to join in      our home birth ritual), this new place we called home      <em>still</em> fell far short of being the small tropical      paradise-with gardens and goats-we wanted to      call our own. And, thanks to our stringent financial      condition, there seemed little chance we'd be able to      afford anything better as long as we stayed in Hawaii.    </p>        <p>      Then-just when we'd almost decided to pack up our      dreams and skulk back to another cold, wet winter in      Oregon-we got our big break. Some friends asked us to      take over their lease on two acres of land, complete with      two-bedroom house, two dogs, a cat, five chickens, and two      small gardens. Best of all, this little mid-Pacific      Shangri-La was really located out in the country too: seven      and a half miles from a small village and one and a half      miles up what darn near qualified as a road. How could we      resist?    </p>    <p>      Our long search for a mini-farmstead washed by warm trade      winds and bathed by the tropical sun was finally over,      nearly a year after it had started. Now it was time for the      hard work to begin!    </p>    <p>      The gardens we had inherited, although adequate for herbs      and legumes, were much too small for our grandiose plans      (we planned to eat all our meals straight out of the      vegetable patch). So we hauled in <em>bigasse</em>      -the crushed, leftover canes from which sugar has      been extracted-that the big mills out here are glad      to get rid of. When combined with good chicken manure,      compost, and whatever other organic material (maybe even a      little dirt) we can find lying around on the lava rock      which makes up most of our part of the island, this      vegetable matter eventually rots down into a decent,      workable soil.    </p>        <p>      We quickly discovered, however, that our mini-farming      experiences back in Idaho and Oregon had not really      provided us with an ounce of practical knowledge about the      growing of greenies in the equatorial zones of the world.      Especially on postage stampsized gardens. And particularly      when those tiny plots are endowed with very little actual      earth ... but with a great deal of lava.    </p>    <p>      Only about one quarter of the seeds we planted bothered to      come up. And either the bugs ate the resulting plants, or      they grew up so spindly that we quickly became too      embarrassed to even mention the word "garden" to our      friends. Obviously we were doing something wrong. Maybe      even eight or nine things.    </p>    <p>      So we swallowed our pride, invited in every neighbor who      had a successful vegetable patch, and picked their brains.      And eventually we began to understand what agriculture a la      Hawaii was all about.    </p>    <p>      One of our worst mistakes, we soon realized, had been in      overlooking the importance of our soil's <em>depth.</em>      (We had been so anxious to have a <em>large</em> garden we      had failed to notice that the earth in part of the plot was      actually too thin to even cover the roots of a      self-respecting radish!)    </p>    <p>      But that problem-once recognized-was easy      enough to solve with a lit tle sweat. We simply picked up      slabs of lava (they're free for the hauling alongside most      bulldozed-out back roads) and used them to build dry rock      walls around our new-and smallervegetable patch. Then we      shoveled all the soil we could scrape up into the tidier      plot (to a depth readily capable of growing 10-foot-tall      corn ... no need to be pessimistic) and stood back and      admired the calluses on our hands.    </p>        <p>      We also started all our new seeds in flats (thus saving our      garden's precious soil for just the plants that sprouted      and also making it possible for us to "succession plant"      more crops into the vegetable plot every year).    </p>    <p>      Next we threw out the straight, wellspaced rows of the      traditional produce patch in favor of "cram as many plants      as possible into every available square inch" intensive      gardening. And, as we transferred each of the sprouted sets      into our walled plot, we placed a large quantity of both      "boughten" organic fertilizer and ground shells under it.    </p>    <p>      By this time our scant supply of vegetable-growing dirt had      become as precious to us as gold and we wasted none of it      on weeds. The unwelcome intruders were pulled and fed to      the chickens ... who kindly knocked off the little soil      sticking to the volunteer plants, shredded and ate the      weeds, and then mixed their resulting droppings into the      stray amounts of earth to make a rich additive that we put      back on the garden. Nice chickens.    </p>    <p>      We have, perhaps, taken this "stretching" of "five  cents      worth of dirt into a thousand-dollar garden" to its logical      extreme with our use of old rubber tires. By removing one      sidewall of a discarded hulk, turning its tread inside,      placing the carcass on bare rock, filling it with soil, and      planting seven or eight heads of lettuce inside ... we've      reached just about the ultimate in growing much with little      soil.    </p>    <p>      And has all this effort paid off? Only so well that we've      become downright obnoxious about our homegrown vegetables.      "See," we tell our visiting friends. "See how prolific our      tiny patches are. See how the baby gobbles the produce with      enthusiasm. See, see, see."    </p>    <p>      Of course, now that we've learned to garden on little more      than the bare lava rock which covers some areas of Hawaii,      we're becoming even more anxious to give up our leased two      acres and buy a little piece of our own of this paradise.      (A piece with <em>real</em> soil on it. Yes, such tracts of      land-although expensive-are available.)    </p>        <p>      In the meantime, we glean all the information we can from      hitchhikers, librarians, postal workers, gardeners, and      local people about the 4,038 square miles of this big      island. There's honest-to-goodness desert, rain forest,      mountains (two 13,000-foot-tall volcanoes-Mauna Loa      and Mauna Kea-are even capped by winter snows), and      cultivated farmlands here and we want to learn all we can      about them while our "land purchase" pennies pile up in the      bank.    </p>    <p>      Luckily for us, the parcels of land for sale that we find      most desirable (the bigger lots that are farthest from the      main highways) ... are also the least expensive! And, since      the local power company now charges $1,300 to set in a      <em>single</em> utility pole, the chances of suburbia      encroaching on the "outback", unelectrified homestead of      our dreams seems relatively slim during the next few      decades. We're quite content with this state of affairs.      And-with patience, persistence, and hard      labor-we'll soon be able to purchase our own small      chunk of this heaven with the hope that it'll remain      unspoiled as long as we live.    </p>    <p>      As we look for "just the right place" we, of course, keep      some very typically Hawaiian considerations uppermost in      our minds:    </p>    <p>      There is more old lava rock on this island than most      <em>malihinis</em> (newcomers) ever imagine, and we want to      be sure that the land we buy is covered with a thick layer      of real dirt.    </p>    <p>      Nor has there been an end to the formation of that lava!      This is a new island-alive and growing-and      <em>Pele</em> , the goddess of the volcano, is still      active. One must think about rift zones and possible future      flows of lava when he or she scouts for property out here.    </p>    <p>      And, new or old, all that rock lying immediately under      Hawaii's surface rules out the possibility of the      inexpensively drilled, deep, fresh water wells that are so      common on the U.S. mainland. The rain, however, falls      abundantly and consistently from remarkably unpolluted      skies and it's not difficult to channel that precipitation      from a roof or other catchment into 55-gallon drums, a      swimming pool, an old-fashioned wooden water tank, or some      other large container.    </p>    <p>      "But," write our mainland friends as they shiver in the      winter snows that we've left far behind, "doesn't it cost a      lot more to live out there? Isn't everything dreadfully      expensive?"    </p>    <p>      "Well now," we reply, "that depends."    </p>        <p>      Super consumerism is indeed expensive here. But who needs      to be a super consumer in Hawaii anyway? The baby lives in      diapers (he wears a T-shirt for dress-up occasions) and the      rest of us are nearly as informal. Ninety-nine-cent rubber      thongs ( <em>zoris</em> ) are the preferred footwear of      almost every <em>kamaaina</em> (old-timer) out here unless      he or she spends a great deal of time climbing around on      lava (and Army surplus work boots are just the ticket for      that). "Good" shoes are reserved for state occasions.    </p>    <p>      Supermarket fare, we'll admit, can be a little dear. But      then, we don't shop in such places anyway. Most of our      vegies and fruits come from the garden ... and we get the      rest from a food co-op at a maximum 10-15% markup      over wholesale cost.    </p>    <p>      All in all, we figure our living expenses here on the Big      Island about equal to what we'd spend day to day back on      the mainland. Which means we're getting 365 days a year of      above-65° weather, trade winds, sunshine, and tropical      afternoon showers thrown in for free.    </p>    <p>      And that's why our dreams of a hand-built castle on our own      little piece of land out here in the middle of the Pacific      just keep right on growing as fast (a foot a day) as the      12-foot-tall bean vines in our backyard!    </p>    <h3>KONA COFFEE</h3>    <p>      If we were to cut the six-foot-tall grass that hides most      of our coffee trees, prune the trees as we should in      January, and otherwise restore our mini-plantation ... our      cash coffee crop from these three acres should be worth      about $3,000 a year.    </p>    <p>      The trees bloom in February and, by May, are covered with      rows of tiny green berries. These berries ripen at various      rates of speed and each must be handpicked when it turns      red. It takes five pounds of the red berries to produce      just one pound of the dark coffee beans you've seen in the      grocery store.    </p>    <p>      Kona coffee trees grow eight to ten feet tall and a small      (three-step) ladder is generally used to reach each tree's      topmost branches. As the berries are plucked, they're      dropped into a handwoven lauhata basket that is strapped to      the picker's waist.    </p>    <p>      The harvested berries are soaked, then pulped, to remove      their flesh and expose the actual coffee "beans" . . .      which are really double seeds in the center of each berry.      The beans are then spread out to dry in open sheds that      have sliding roofs which may be pulled over the coffee to      protect it during each afternoon's rain.    </p>    <p>      Once the beans are dry, their thin but tough husks must be      removed, and this is usually done with a mechanized husker      at a co-op mill. The green, husked beans are either packed      for shipment to the mainland at this point ... or roasted,      packaged, and sold locally.-BB.    </p>    <h3>TARO</h3>        <p>      Taro (a tropical plant of the arum family) produces a      starchy, tuberous root that local Big Island people eat      about as frequently as mainlanders eat potatoes.    </p>    <p>      The tubers can be purchased in the supermarkets out here      and, when planted, will grow and multiply like the roots of      a lily. It's then a simple matter to cut off new bulbs as      they're created and either eat them ... or replant them to      increase the size of a taro patch. You can also cut all but      one-half inch of root from a stalk, eat the root, replant      the stalk (after pruning off the main part of the plant)      ... and then watch the little stub grow into a healthy      plant-complate with edible roots!-again.    </p>    <p>      Several varieties of taro grow here and all contain oxalic      acid, an irritant which penetrates the skin and throat like      particles of fiberglass. (Some wild taro contains so much      of this acid that, even when cooked, its leaves and roots      can be fatal.) So, although it's no big deal, it is      necessary to break down the crystals of oxalic acid by      cooking all taro before it's eaten ... and it's a good idea      to be able to identify the most popular varieties of the      plant if you want to feast on them.    </p>    <p>      Dasheen (Japanese taro) has small bulbs, is rich in      carbohydrates and proteins, is usually steamed, and tastes      a bit like boiled plantain (cooking bananas). One of our      Japanese neighbors makes <em>shoyu</em> (local name for soy      sauce) chicken by cooking dasheen, green beans, and chicken      in a sauce of shoyu, sugar, and ginger.    </p>    <p>      Tahitian taro is grown for its small, tender leaves      which-though acrid when raw-are delicious If      cooked like spinach.    </p>    <p>      Mana taro is well named. It grows so prolifically that it's      like manna from heaven. The roots of this variety often      weigh five pounds or more and, although they can be used in      any recipe that calls for potatoes, they're usually eaten      as poi.    </p>    <p>      Poi, perhaps, can be described as a thin, pink, mashed      potato paste ... but with a sweeter, distinctive flavor of      its own. It's made by steaming, boiling, or baking taro      until a chopstick can be run through the root. The taro is      then mashed and a little water at a time is added until      just the right consistency is reached. (Some people prefer      to dip poi with one finger, others with two, still others      with three fingers. And Hawaiian cooks vary their recipes      accordingly.) We think that the nicest way to eat mane taro      is as two-finger, three-day poi popped into the mouth      simultaneously with a bits of roasted wild kalua      pig.-BB.    </p>    <h3>OUR $75-A-MONTH HAWAIIAN COFFEE PLANTATION</h3>        <p>      Tropical homesteading on a threeacre coffee plantation on      the Kona Coast of Hawaii. What a wonderful way to live!    </p>    <p>      My husband and I are comfortably "settled in" only two      miles from beautiful white sand beaches and emerald water      alive with multi-colored fish. Exotic ripe fruits fall      invitingly at our feet each evening as we watch a different      (and brilliant) Pacific sunset. And, perhaps best of all,      it costs us only $75 a month to lease our little paradise!    </p>    <p>      No, many would-be Big Island settlers are not as fortunate      as we've been. They come out here, pay $250 a month for an      apartment, spend a year looking around for a few acres of      coffee-growing land, never quite find what they want, and      finally give up and go back to the mainland. Others (such      as ourselves), however, seem to find what they're seeking      right away. Maybe because they're searching for something      just a little different than what they left back home.    </p>    <p>      The house we're living in, for instance, is old and      tin-roofed and termite-ridden. It has no plumbing and our      privy is an outhouse nestled back in a nearby banana grove.    </p>    <p>      But the place is <em>huge</em> (it once accommodated a      mill, a store, <em>and</em> living quarters). And we      <em>do</em> have electricity. And our large redwood holding      tank (which catches the rain that falls on our corrugated      roof) <em>is</em> always full. And we <em>don't</em> really      mind carrying water into the house in five-gallon jugs. And      we <em>have</em> installed a kitchen sink that drains to a      lychee tree in the yard. And we <em>do</em> enjoy our      <em>ofuro</em> (the traditional heated Japanese bath) and a      cold outdoor shower which feels good on most of our      summer-like days.    </p>    <p>      Mango, papaya, lychee, banana, avocado, grapefruit, orange,      mountain apple, and macadamia nut trees surround the      house... as do raspberry and passion fruit vines and guava      bushes. The kitchen garden-which has been growing      wild for years-yields sweet potatoes and several varieties      of taro. And enough coffee trees still bear on this      long-neglected old plantation to allow us to experiment      with home-roastedand-ground beans for breakfast.    </p>    <p>      No, the life we now live is certainly not for everyone. But      we have only to bite into the ambrosia of a sun-warmed      mango or dive into the sparkling waters of a friendly      neighborhood lagoon to reassure ourselves that it      <em>is</em> the life for us. Especially at a base cost of      only $75 a month!-Beverlie Beauclerk.    </p>    <h3>HAWAII LAND LEASES, AND FEE SIMPLE</h3>    <p>      Much of the land in Hawaii is held in large family estates.      And, since the local tax structure makes it a money-losing      proposition to sell acreage in small blocks, it has become      common to lease land out in three- to live-acre parcels.      The leases often [1] run for 50 years, and [2] require the      lessee to farm his or her parcel and make annual      improvements on it.    </p>    <p>      The government is currently considering a law under which      this leased land would be condemned, taken over, and sold      to each lessee at a fair market value. In the meantime,      there's a moratorium on the renewal of leases or the      issuing of new ones.    </p>    <p>      Which means that about the only way you can get onto a      piece of Big Island land right now is by finding someone      who wants to give away or sell an existing lease. Lessees,      for instance, are currently selling their rights to      five-acre tracts for about $10,000 ... which is really a      pretty good deal if there are 40 years or so left on the      lease.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if you're <em>determined</em> to      buy-rather than lease-a chunk of Big Island      land, you can sometimes purchase such acreage (it's called      "fee simple" land) if you're willing to look long and hard      ... and then shell out $30,000 an acre. And that's why most      of us out here settle for leasing instead of buying.    </p>    <p>      One further tip: You're definitely ahead of the      game-no matter whether you buy or lease-if the      land you settle on already boasts some sort of satisfactory      dwelling. Hawaii's current building codes are very similar      to those in effect in California (in other words, they're      <em>tough</em> ), and they're diligently      enforced.-BB.    </p>    <h3>WE LOVE THESE KONA COAST TROPICAL FRUITS</h3>    <p>      <strong>GUAVA:</strong> Grows on large bushes. The skin of      the fruit is soft and yellow. The meat inside has a pink,      firm texture, is tart, and contains a great deal of vitamin      C. Guavas can be eaten fresh and guava juice is      commercially canned and widely sold.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LYCHEE:</strong> Harvested from large trees. The      fruit is red and has a leathery texture. The sweet and      almondy flesh inside is somewhat grape-like.    </p>        <p>      <strong>MANGO:</strong> This peach-like fruit grows on      large trees and tastes like an exotic apricot. Mangoes can      be eaten while still green and crisp or after they've be.      come ripe, sweet, and soft. Locals prefer them soaked in      soy sauce, sugar, and ginger while the mangoes are still      green.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PAPAYA:</strong> This delicious fruit grows in      bunches spiraled around the tops of the trunks of      20-foot-tall, house plantlike trees. Papayas are a very      mellow orange-ish yellow when ripe. The fruit's meat has a      texture and flavor very much like a cantaloupe melon . . .      but different. Papaya seeds, which form in the fruits'      hollow centers, look like fish eggs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PASSION FRUIT:</strong> This little delicacy is      borne an climbing vines and is eaten after it has dropped      to the ground. Passion fruit's amber-colored skin is hard.      Eating the fruit is something like sucking an egg ...      except that the flavor of this "egg" can best be described      as "an explosion of aromatic flowers" in your      mouth.-BB.    </p>
