    <meta name="description" content="March/April 1977 | Anyone whos seen any of rural America has seen a gambrel roof. These simple but elegant structures (which, until not too long ago, were the hallmark of the American farm) have been popular on hay barns for many years, primarily because the loft of a barn topped with such a roof will hold a considerable amount of hay. Theres no reason, though, why the classic gambrel cannot be used on other kinds of structures (such as log cabins) when storage space is at a premium. By Philip Baechler" />
