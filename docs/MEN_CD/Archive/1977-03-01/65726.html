                    <p>      " A rose may always be a rose." says Jack Roland Coggins,      "but the common garden parsnip-once you get to know      it-is actually in disguise."    </p>    <p>      "Parsnips ... ugh!"    </p>    <p>      There's something about the very word "parsnip" that can      shrivel the taste buds of a generation raised on TV      dinners. And I'll admit that the way in which this root      vegetable is traditionally served (boiled and buttered)      seems to please more adult than juvenile palates.    </p>    <p>      But parsnips can be so much more! Soups and stews, for      instance. French fries. Pancakes. Pies. Even flaming      desserts! As I'll prove before this article is finished.    </p>   <h3>BUT FIRST, LET'S GROW SOME PARSNIPS</h3>        <p>      Parsnips are a "full season" crop (the roots take about 130      days to reach full maturity) and do best when planted      sometime between early spring and early summer. I like to      put mine in my garden's border rows ... where they're out      of the way as my family harvests faster-growing produce in      the rest of the vegetable patch and sows second crops in      its place.    </p>    <p>      Sprinkle your parsnip seeds out very thinly and about      one-half inch deep in rows spaced two feet apart. Then,      when the plants are three inches tall, thin them until they      stand five inches from each other in the rows. (These are      average "common sense" distances that should guarantee      success for almost any first-time parsnip grower. I have,      however, grown superior parsnips spaced only three inches      apart in rows separated by just eighteen inches.)    </p>    <p>      The best parsnips are smooth-skinned and tender, and have a      sweet flavor. And the keys to making yours grow up that way      are [1] rich soil, and [2] ample and <em>consistent</em>      moisture.    </p>    <p>      Parsnips require plenty of moisture all the time and the      surest way to turn your roots into a woody, fibrous,      malformed crop is by allowing the earth around them to      become dry for even short periods of time.    </p>    <p>      But then, of course, there's no real need for your parsnip      patch to dry out. Not when it's so easy to keep it      consistently moist with a thick layer of leaves, weeds,      grass cuttings, straw, hay, or other organic mulch. Even a      heavy carpet of newspapers or magazines weighted down      between the rows with stones will do the trick.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO HARVEST AND STORE PARSNIPS</h3>        <p>      Your roots may be added to soups and stews as soon as they      attain a reasonable size. Freezing, however, greatly      improves both the flavor and texture of the vegetable and      brings out its sweetness and aromatic characteristic.    </p>    <p>      Before the ground freezes, then, you should dig only as      many parsnips as you'll want to use during the main part of      the winter. When washed and wrapped whole in anything (say,      waxed paper) that conserves their moisture, these roots      will keep for weeks-even several months-in a refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Whole washed and wrapped parsnips will also keep well in      unheated garages, sheds, and cellars during the very cool      days of fall and on into the winter. Do not, though, allow      such roots to alternately freeze and thaw. (One good      continuous freeze is OK, but alternate freezes and thaws      will cause the vegetable to rot.) Keep any parsnips stored      this way cool-even cold-but unfrozen.    </p>    <p>      Parsnips are ideal candidates for pit storage too. Just      bury a big box or barrel in your garden or yard (I've sunk      a number of nail kegs from the local lumberyard in mine),      fill it with layers of parsnips surrounded and separated by      layers of dry leaves or straw, fit the container with a      tight lid, and cover it with a tall mound of soil. The      idea, once again, is to keep the harvested roots ill from      drying out, and [2] cool-even cold-but free from the danger      of alternately freezing and thawing.    </p>    <p>      Of course, in most localities where parsnips are grown,      there's no real need to go to even this amount of trouble.      Here in Nebraska, for example, I usually just leave about      half of each year's crop of the vegetable right in the      ground and right in the rows in which they grew. All I do,      in the fall before the first freeze, is cover the parsnips      with four or five inches of dirt and then top that earth      with another four or five inches of straw, leaves, or other      mulch. So protected, the roots slumber peacefully through      the winter and are at their very best when dug fresh as      desired from the garden early the following spring.    </p>    <p>      The general rule, by the way, that most folks follow when      using this last method of storing parsnips is "the roots      must be harvested in the spring before new growth begins".      And it is true that the vegetables probably will be      worthless for the table if they've started to grow again      before you dig them. I have found, though, that the      parsnips themselves are still quite palatable if dug after      only a little new foliar growth has been sent out by the      plants.    </p>    <p>      What this means in actual practice is that, as soon as I      see the first signs of new green foliage popping up in my      buried last-year's parsnip patch, I simply pile on more      soil and mulch. By so doing, I've been able to inhibit any      damaging second-year growth until as late as May 1.    </p>    <p>      Still, the earlier you dig "wintered over" parsnips, the      better. And, properly stored (washed and wrapped and placed      in the refrigerator or a cool cellar), such spring-dug      parsnips will keep and keep well until the new crop matures      in the fall.    </p>    <p>      Finally, if you're a true child of the modern age ... yes,      you can store parsnips in your home freezer too. Wash each      root thoroughly and slice it-either cross- or      length-wise--into quarter-inch-thick pieces. If the cores      are woody, remove them with a sharp knife. Then water-scald      the chunks of vegetable for three minutes or steam-scald      them for four ... and cool, bag, and freeze the prepared      parsnips.    </p>    <h3>COOK THOSE PARSNIPS!</h3>    <p>      Parsnips are rich in minerals and vitamins ... especially      vitamin C. The vegetable is also reputed to aid digestion.      And, although I have no scientific or medical proof, I      personally find that regular servings of the roots improve      my circulation and alleviate pain in my joints, my hands,      and my feet.    </p>    <p>      I'm sold, then, on the healthful benefits of eating      parsnips. I'm also, after some experimentation, more than a      little excited by the gastronomic potential of the      vegetable ... as I'm sure you will be too if you try the      following recipes.    </p>    <h3>ROOT CHOWDER</h3>    <p>      Slice one medium parsnip (core it, if its center is woody),      one small turnip, one medium carrot, one small onion, two      golf ball-sized potatoes, and three medium salsify, and      steam them all in a covered container until they're      completely tender. Then mash or blend all the vegetables      and combine them with four cups of milk. Bring the      resulting solution to a near boil-but do not boil      it-over a low flame.    </p>    <p>      Brighten the dish with pinches of garlic powder, red pepper      flakes, parsley, oregano (go easy), or celery seasoning.      Then pour the chowder into bowls, top with pats of butter,      and season to taste with salt and black pepper.    </p>    <h3>FRENCH FRIED PARSNIPS</h3>    <p>      Cut very large parsnips crosswise into four-inch-long      sections. Then quarter each section lengthwise and slice      the resulting pieces lengthwise again into eighths. Remove      all cores and continue slicing the pieces of parsnip      lengthwise until each one is "french-fry" size.    </p>    <p>      Deep-fry the slivers of vegetable in oil, just the way      you'd deep-fry potatoes, until they're golden brown. Salt      and pepper to taste and serve as a supremely healthful      snack, or side dish.    </p>    <p>      For tenderest fries, deep-fry the sliced root over a low      flame in a covered pan until each sliver is half done. Then      remove the cover and brown the pan's contents over a      medium-high flame. You'll be surprised at how little oil      the pieces of parsnip will absorb!    </p>    <h3>MILLION DOLLAR PARSNIP PANCAKES</h3>    <p>      Cut the upper halves of large parsnips into silver      dollarsized slices three-eighths of an inch thick. Then      tenderize the slices by cooking them in a small amount of      water in a covered skillet over a very low flame. Cook this      way until the inner core, as well as the outer flesh, of      each chunk of the root is tender.    </p>    <p>      Finally, remove the cover, add enough butter or margarine      to brown the slices, and serve them with maple syrup, fruit      syrup, or honey. And that's all! This dish tastes better      than "real" pancakes, and is certainly more healthful.    </p>  <h3> NOT-PUMPKIN PIE</h3>    <p>      Use your best pumpkin pie recipe ... but substitute an      equal amount of cooked and blended parsnips for the      pumpkin. Serve cold with ice cream or whipped cream.    </p>    <h3>PARSNIP-PECAN DREAM</h3>    <p>      Add one-half to one cup of chopped or blended shelled      pecans to the Not-Pumpkin Pie recipe (above). Fill      individual baking dishes with the mixture and bake until it      becomes firm (approximately 45 minutes at 350° F). Top      with pecan halves and cherries. Chill. Serve with whipped      cream topping.    </p>    <h3>PARSNIP ROYALE</h3>    <p>      Cook four cups of one-quarter-inch-thick slices of parsnip      in one-half cup of orange juice in a covered skillet, over      a very low flame until the parsnips are half tender.      Maintain enough liquid (orange juice or water) in the pan      at all times to prevent burning.    </p>    <p>      When the slices of parsnip have softened but are still      firm, add one-eighth pound of butter or margarine and      simmer until the shortening is absorbed by the chunks of      vegetable (about three minutes).    </p>    <p>      Then add one-half cup of honey and a dash of ginger. Cook      everything over very low heat until the slices of parsnip      are thoroughly tender and the, syrup has thickened      slightly. Do not overcook.    </p>    <p>      Serve this heavenly creation, piping hot, in very small      dishes (it's rich). Top each portion with one tablespoon of      honey-butter-orange juice syrup. For a really special      occasion, you can pour a scant spoonful of brandy into each      bowl, ignite it, and present this dessert <em>au      flambeau.</em>    </p>
