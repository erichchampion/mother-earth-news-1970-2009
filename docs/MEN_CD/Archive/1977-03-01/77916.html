        <h3>FOR MORE INFORMATION</h3><p><em>The Dairy Goat Journal</em> ($7.00/ year from Box 1908, Scottsdale, Ariz. 85252) is devoted entirely to goatlore and is a must for any serious dairy goat enthusiast. <em>Countryside</em> ($9.00/year from Highway 19 East, Waterloo, Wis. 53594) has a regular goat section in addition to articles of general interest to homesteaders and back-to-the-landers. Both magazines are published twelve times per year.</p><p>Although there are numerous smaller dairy goat organizations scattered around the country, the single largest national group is the American Dairy Goat Association, Box 865, Spindale, N.C. 28160, which sponsors shows, publishes a yearbook, and offers other services to goat owners. Membership costs $15 the first year, $10 per year thereafter.</p><p>As for books, Helen Walsh's <em>Starting Right with Milk Goats</em><em>($3.50) and Jerry Belanger's</em> Raising Milk Goats the Modern Way ($3.95) are perhaps two of the finest dairy goat primers ever written. Both are available from bookstores, Garden Way Publishing (Charlotte, Vt. 05445), or Mother's Bookshelf (Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739). Be sure to enclose 75 cents for handling when ordering by mail.</p><p><strong>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-</strong>~-~-~-~-~</p><p>Before you buy any dairy goat, isolate the animal ... then [1] check her up close, [2] stand back and take a long, hard look at her overall appearance, [3] watch the doe (from the front, side, and rear) as she walks, and [4] go over all the points on the following list. If the nanny falls to meet two or more criteria, consider her a waste of money ... no matter what a "bargain" she may be.</p><p><strong>UDDER:</strong></p><p>_______a. Well formed (not low-hanging)</p><p>_______b. No indication of mastitis, both sides producing.</p><p>_______c. No double teats'<br />_______d.

One-hand-width separation of front legs</p><p><strong>GENERAL APPEARANCE:</strong></p><p>_______a. Shiny coat</p><p>_______b. Good weight in proportion to size</p><p>_______c. Bright eyes</p><p>_______d. Pleasing personality</p><p><strong>OTHER CRITERIA:</strong></p><p>1. <em>Doe kid.</em> Purchase only if either [1] a half sister by the same sire, [2] full sisters, or [3] the kid's mother is available for your inspection. (The related animal must-of course-meet all the above criteria.)</p><p>2. <em>Virgin dry doe</em>. Purchase only if the doe is under two years of age and meets the above criteria.</p><p>3. <em>Bred doe</em> (dry or milking). Must come with [A] a written guarantee of pregnancy and [B] a service memo signed by the owner of the buck, if the buck is registered.</p><p>4. <em>Lactating doe (of any kind)</em>. Witness two consecutive milkings. Minimum daily production for a first freshener (up to three months fresh): three quarts. For second through sixth freshenings, the minimum daily amounts allowable are: four quarts if fresh less than 3 months, three quarts if fresh 5 to 6 months, two quarts if fresh 7 to 8 months, and one quart if fresh over 9 months.</p>
