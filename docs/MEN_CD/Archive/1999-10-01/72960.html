        <p><strong>1</strong> Agricultural Fair Day (the first agricultural fair in the United States was held in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in 1810); the Model T Ford was introduced this day in 1908-at a price of $850; former President Jimmy Carter was born this day 75 years ago.</p><p><strong>2</strong> L AST QUARTER MOON, 12:02 A.M. EDT (first of five lunar phases this month); birthdate of Mahatma Gandhi, Groucho Marx and Nat Turner (born in 1800).</p><p><strong>4</strong> St. Francis of Assisi Day, Mars, brightest orange-gold point of light in southwest at nightfall, is very near the star Theta Ophiuchi (the two are so close together that binoculars are needed to spot the star); Sputnik 1 became first artificial satellite this day in 1957; Luna 3 spacecraft took first photos of moon's far side 40 years ago today; Pope Gregory introduced Gregorian calendar this day in 1582.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Crescent moon tops beautiful triangle, which also includes Venus and the star Regulus, visible in the east before dawn; Hurricane Ginger died after a record 31 days this day in 1971; temperature hit a high of 116°F at Sentinel, Arizona, in 1917 (check entry for October 29 to see how cold it got elsewhere during the tenth month of 1917).</p><p><strong>6</strong> Moon well to the lower left of Venus and Regulus before dawn; in 1836, 26 inches of snow fell at Auburn, New York; this day in 1858, Thoreau writes in his journal: "Now, methinks, the autumnal tints are brightest in our streets, and in the woods generally. ...Stand where half a dozen large elms droop over a house. It is as if you stood within a ripe pumpkin rind, and you feel as mellow as if you were the pulp!"</p><p><strong>7</strong> For this and the following two days, blazingly bright Venus and modestly bright Regulus only about 3° apart (a little more than your thumb's width at arm's length) in the east before dawn.</p><p><strong>8</strong> In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire was started (supposedly by Mrs. O'Leary's cow), killed 259 and left nearly 100,000 homeless, while doing $200 million in property damage; the same day in 1871, more than 600 die as Peshtigo, Wisconsin, is destroyed by a forest fire.</p><p><strong>9</strong> NEW MOON, 7:34 A.m. EDT, Leif Eriksson Day (Eriksson is believed to have landed in America about 1000 A.D.).</p><p><strong>10</strong> A downpour of 15.68 inches flooded Enid, Oklahoma, this day in 1973.</p><p><strong>11</strong> Columbus Day (observed); Thanksgiving Day in Canada; Native Americans Day in South Dakota; in 1925, Vermont and New Hampshire received 24 inches of snow.</p><p><strong>13</strong> Cornerstone of the White House laid, 1792.</p><p><strong>14</strong> In 1965, 24 inches of rain in 24 hours inundates Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p><p><strong>15</strong> Mars is at its farthest south among the stars for the year; in 1954, Hurricane Hazel made landfall at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.</p><p><strong>17</strong> FIRST QUARTER MOON, 11:00 A.M. EDT.</p><p><strong>18</strong> Alaska Day; St. Luke's Day and start of supposed Indian Summer-like warm period called "St. Luke's Little Summer."</p><p><strong>20</strong> In 1965, Los Angeles hit 100°F for ten days in a row, starting today.</p><p><strong>21</strong> Look for peak numbers of Orionid meteors from south in final hour of full darkness before dawn this morning.</p><p><strong>22</strong> In 1965, San Diego hits 104°F.</p><p><strong>23</strong> Jupiter reaches "opposition "-opposite the sun in sky and thus rising at sunset and highest in middle of night. It is also the biggest in telescopes and brightest it has been in 12 years (just the tiniest bit brighter and bigger than at last year's opposition). Jupiter is far brighter than any other point of light in the sky until Venus rises several hours before sunup. Jupiter is followed up the east sky by its fellow giant gas planet Saturn, a bright (though much less bright) point of steady light about one handspan at arm's length to its lower left. Saturn comes to opposition itself just 14 days from now. Also today, the sun enters astrological sign Scorpio; the swallows depart from San Juan Capistrano in California.</p><p><strong>24</strong> FULL MOON (Hunter's Moon), 5:02 p.m. EDT</p><p><strong>25</strong> St. Crispin's Day; Mars just above top star in the "teapot" of Sagittarius.</p><p><strong>29</strong> In 1963, Hurricane Ginny made landfall in Nova Scotia, producing 18 inches of snow (yes, snow!) in northern Maine; in 1917, temperature hits low of -33°F at Soda Butte, Wyoming.</p><p><strong>31</strong> Halloween (All Hallows Eve); at 2 A.M., set clocks back one hour to return to Standard Time; LAST QUARTER MOON, 7:04 A.m. EST</p><h3>ALMANAC NOVEMBER 1999</h3><p><strong>1</strong> All Saints Day; Nevada Day.</p><p><strong>2</strong> Election Day, All Souls Day; rain and cloud from passing hurricane prevented Benjamin Franklin from seeing a lunar eclipse this day in 1743.</p><p><strong>3</strong> Taurid meteors, from high in east in the evening, peak during next seven days or so; in 1966, Los Angeles hits 100°F</p><p><strong>4</strong> Will Rogers Day in Oklahoma.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Guy Fawkes Day in England.</p><p><strong>6</strong> Sat urn reaches "opposition" on a Saturday, the day of the week named for Saturn. Opposition means Saturn appears opposite the sun in the sky and thus rises at sunset and is visible all night long. The planet is also the brightest and biggest it has been in almost a quarter-century (telescopes show the rings tilted a generous 20° from edge on). Look for Saturn rising in evening twilight about one handspan at arm's length to the lower left of a much brighter Jupiter. The largest and the second largest planet form a spectacular pair. (Also today, brilliant Venus is passing just above the star Beta Virginis in the east before dawn.)</p><p><strong>7</strong> NEW MOON, 10:53 p.m. EST, mathematical midway point of autumn; Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811.</p><p><strong>8</strong> In 1966, San Francisco sets its all-time November high temperature record with 86°F</p><p><strong>9</strong> In 1913, the "Freshwater Fury" storm sank eight ore carriers, killing 200 people, and brought 22 inches of snow to Cleveland; launch of first Saturn V rocket, carrying unmanned Apollo 4 spacecraft into orbit 1967.</p><p><strong>11</strong> Veterans Day (original World War I Armistice Day); Martinmas.</p><p><strong>12</strong> This day in 1981, second launching of the space shuttle Columbia, first re-use of a space vehicle; high of 105°F in Craftonville, California, in 1906.</p><p><strong>13</strong> Before dawn, Venus passes breathtakingly close to the star Eta Virginis-but so close a telescope is needed to see the star at nightfall, the crescent moon is to the upper left of Mars.</p><p><strong>14</strong> Lightning struck Apollo 12 just 43 seconds into flight, knocking out the electronic guidance system. The mission survived and became the second to land man on the moon.</p><p><strong>15</strong> For the first time since 1973, the U.S. gets to see the planet Mercury "transit" or creep across the face of the sun. This rare event begins right at sunset as seen from the East Coast, earlier the farther west in the U.S. you are. It can only be observed safely by using a telescope equipped with a proper solar filter (between the sun and the main lens or mirror of the telescope, not between the eye and eyepiece) or with a telescope projecting an image of the sun onto some kind of screen (piece of cardboard or other surface). Mercury will appear as a dark dot blacker and probably smaller than many sunspots that will dot the solar face at this time. At this particular transit, the little planet passes very near the northern edge of the sun</p><p><strong>16</strong> FIRST QUARTER MOON, 4:03 A.m. EST, watch for a possibly spectacular Leonid meteor display later tonight (see entries for next two days).</p><p><strong>17</strong> Watch for Leonid meteor storm of thousands of "shooting stars" between midnight and dawn today ( see text of sidebar at right ).</p><p><strong>18</strong> Watch again for Leonid meteor storm between midnight and dawn.</p><p><strong>19</strong> Discovery Day in Puerto Rico; in 1863, Lincoln delivers the Gettysburg Address-270 words taking less than two minutes to say.</p><p><strong>20</strong> In 1981, a tornado hit Atlanta International Airport, ripping an engine off a DC-8 and damaging 20 other airliners.</p><p><strong>21</strong> In 1967, eight inches of rain in Los Angeles-14 inches in the mountains-is followed by floods and damaging mudslides.</p><p><strong>22</strong> Sun enters astrological sign Sagittarius.</p><p><strong>23</strong> FULL MOON, 2:04 A.M. EST; Sun enters constellation Scorpio.</p><p><strong>24</strong> In 1950, a storm produced gusts as high as 110 mph in Concord, New Hampshire, and snow as high as 57 inches at Pickens, West Virginia.</p><p><strong>25</strong> THANKSGIVING; St. Catherine's Day.</p><p><strong>26</strong> Acadian Day in Louisiana.</p><p><strong>27</strong> In 1898, about 400 people were killed by a storm off the New England coast (200 died on one passenger ship alone).</p><p><strong>28</strong> First Sunday in Advent in 1960, storm created 20-to 40-foot waves on Lake Superior.</p><p><strong>29</strong> LAST QUARTER MOON, 6:18 P.m. EST; Mars is 1.7° from Neptune this evening (but the latter requires optical aid to see and special star charts to identify).</p><div class="sidebar"><h3>SEASON OF THE LEONIDS<br />Look for the Meteor Storm!</h3><p>Sometime between midnight and dawn on either November 17 or 18, 1999, folks in at least some regions of the world will look up to see literally thousands of "shooting stars" flaming across the sky. Because these meteors will all appear to radiate out from a point in the constellation Leo, the event is known as a Leonid meteor storm.</p><p>A meteor is a streak of light caused when a piece of space dust or rock enters Earth's atmosphere at speeds so great it burns up from the friction. On certain days every year, when Earth passes through the meteoroidal debris left by particular comets, we may see as many as several dozen shooting stars per hour in what is I called a meteor shower. But a few times a century (at most) Earth may go through far denser clouds of particles closer to a comet that is passing or has recently passed. It's on these rare occasions that nightsky watchers may be treated to a, meteor storm.</p><p>In 1833 a Leonid meteor storm was so intense, it woke people in their beds in Boston and is remembered as the "Night the Stars Fell on Alabama." In 1966 folks in parts of the Southwest saw the number of Leonids reach, at least for a minute or so, a rate estimated at about 500,000 meteors per hour! One observer said it was like watching "waterfalls" of shooting stars pour down the sides of the sky.</p><p>Who knows what wonders this year's storm might bring-and where? Some experts think that Europe will see the peak in the early hours of November 18 and that by the time Leo rises in the U.S. several hours later, the meteor rates may be greatly reduced. But no one can be sure of the exact timing.</p><p>Whatever the case, bear in mind that driving a few miles (or few dozen miles) from city light pollution will make a tremendous difference in the number of Leonids seen and the overall splendor of the show.</p><p>-Fred Schaa f</p></div>
