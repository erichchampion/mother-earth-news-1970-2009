            		                <p>      In April, North Dakota became the first state since 1937 to      legalize and set production guidelines for growing      industrial hemp, despite a longstanding ban on the crop by      the Drug Enforcement Agency. According the DEA, hemp is      marijuana and thus illegal regardless of the fact that hemp      contains less than 1% of the psychoactive ingredient, Tetra      hydrocannabinol (THC). By comparison, marijuana usually      contains 5% to 20% of THC.<br />      <br />      But under pressure from farmers eager for alternative      crops, the DEA ban is showing signs of collapse-and      not just in North Dakota. Twelve states have passed or are      considering pro-hemp legislation. Minnesota, Illinois and      Hawaii will grow hemp experimentally, while New Mexico is      researching hemp farming. Hemp legislation is pending in      Tennessee, Vermont, New Hampshire, Iowa and Maryland, while      Montana and Virginia have requested an end to the federal      ban. On the West Coast, the California Democratic Party has      added legalization of industrial hemp to its      platform.<br />      <br />      Meanwhile, organizations like the Kentucky Hemp Growers      Cooperative Association and the North American Industrial      Hemp Council are pressuring the DEA with a law suit filed      after actor Woody Harrelson was arrested in 1996 for      planting hemp seeds. The Kentucky Supreme Court is      reviewing the suit.    </p>    <p>      "Sending this kind of message to the federal government      will get them to address the issue," says Rep. David      Monson, a sponsor of the North Dakota bill. "Their problems      and fears [about hemp] are unfounded."<br />      <br />      Hemp can be made into food, soap, ink, textiles, paper and      fuel. It can grow almost anywhere and requires little water      or pesticides to flourish, while naturally controlling      surrounding weeds. Hemp is produced in 33 countries,      including Canada, and while U.S. manufacturers import it,      many say growing it domestically could help boost the      economy and farmers' incomes. "Farmers are going broke,"      Monson says. "We need hemp to stop this cycle.''    </p>    <p>      <em>-Cheryl Maday</em>    </p>
