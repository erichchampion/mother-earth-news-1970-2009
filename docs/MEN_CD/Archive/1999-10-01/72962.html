                        <p>      October and November are when whistling swans, after      summering in subarctic and even arctic lands, migrate      through the Great Lakes region and arrive at their      wintering grounds on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The      whistling swan owes its name not to its vocal abilities,      but instead to the "singing" of its beating wings. Its      largest wintering ground appears to be in Maryland on      Chesapeake Bay. The swans you see in summer floating      serenely at your local park are most likely mute      swans-partly domesticated birds imported from Europe.      The mute swan can easily be distinguished from the      whistling swan (as well as America's only other variety,      the trumpeter swan) by its neck, which is not held straight      but rather in an exquisite curve.<br />      <br />      Our third swan species, the trumpeter, is somewhat larger      than the whistling swan but otherwise looks similar from      afar. Unfortunately, any straight-necked swan seen today in      either the eastern or western U.S. is probably a whistling      swan. I say unfortunately because the trumpeter was once      common across all of America until it was      hunted-sometimes the flightless young were even      lassoed from boats-into near-extinction. Protection      finally came by way of conservation laws passed in 1924,      but by then the trumpeter's numbers had dwindled to an      estimated 50 birds. Fortunately, 30 years later, the      population was back up to 642 and even now the recovery      continues. But you are still unlikely to see a trumpeter      outside the northern Rockies.    </p>    <p>      What did we almost lose in the trumpeter swan? The largest      of North America's waterfowl, a snow-white bird weighing as      much as 36 pounds, with a body up to six-feet long and a      wingspan up to ten-feet wide.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Fred Schaaf</em>    </p>
