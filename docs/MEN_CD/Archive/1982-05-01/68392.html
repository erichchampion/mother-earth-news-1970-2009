                    <p>      Helen Keller probably summed it up best: "Life is either a      daring adventure or nothing."    </p>    <p>      STAFF PHOTOS    </p>        <p>      <br />      A weekly bazaar, Nepalese style.    </p>        <p>      <br />      Three Sherpas and their pet.    </p>        <p>      <br />      ne of Kathmandu's exotic temples.    </p>        <p>      <br />      The porters take a break    </p>        <p>      <br />      A bridge of "questionable intergrity".    </p>        <p>      <br />      Chainpur, the brass center.    </p>        <p>      <br />      Makalu and its neighboring peaks at dawn.    </p>        <p>      <br />      Sunset on a mountain lakes.    </p>    <p>      "Hello! Good morning! Tea!" a gentle voice announced      outside the tent. It was 6:00 a.m., and-as just a      small part of the impeccable service provided by Journeys'      Pemba Tsering Sherpa and his Nepalese staff-we      enjoyed our morning "cuppa" without venturing out of our      sleeping bags. While still-sleepy hikers sipped the welcome      brew, pans of hot washing water were placed at the doors of      our tents . . . and another adventure-filled day on      MOTHER'S trek to the remote Arun Valley region of eastern      Nepal began.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A COMFORTING ROUTINE</strong><br />      We soon fell into the camp routine . . . dressing quickly      and packing our duffels so that the porters-who      carried 80-pound loads in their tall baskets with seeming      ease-could get an early start. As we gathered for a      big breakfast, the Sherpa guides struck and packed the      tents . . . and around 7:00 a.m., leaving the kitchen staff      to clean up, we took to the trails.    </p>    <p>      Ah, the trails! Though the footpaths we traveled are the      superhighways of Nepal, they're not the neatly maintained      variety-designed with reasonable grades and handy      switchbacks-familiar to most American backpackers.      Instead, they follow the Nepalese notion that the only      <em>logical</em> way to get from one point to another is      (whenever possible) to travel in a direct line . . .      regardless of whether that course takes them 3,000 feet      straight up a ridge and then drops, just as precipitously,      down on the other side.    </p>    <p>      Streams and waterfalls pour down the mountain slopes, too,      resulting in challenging crossings on a variety of      ingenious bridges . . . many of which appear to be of      questionable integrity! Over the larger rivers, aging      planks rest on wire loops, which-in turn-are      attached to a couple of (often well-rusted) chains or      cables strung high above the tumbling waters.    </p>    <p>      Despite such obstacles, the distances that we covered      were-on some days-little short of phenomenal,      reminding us that steady, determined footpower is an      amazingly effective form of transportation (a fact that's      all too easily forgotten in our car-oriented society). Yet      each individual was easily able to set his or her own pace,      and if one dropped an hour or so behind to socialize with      the locals in a smoky teahouse ... to play with a fat,      laughing baby ... to admire a newborn goat ... or simply to      rest legs and lungs that were protesting with a bit too      much insistence, an arrow-scratched in the dirt by a      guide-would always show which branch of the trail the      group had taken.    </p>    <p>      Off and on during a typical morning, members of our jaunty,      singing kitchen crew-carrying dishes and cooking      paraphernalia-would pass us by ... and at midday      they'd have a hot lunch ready and waiting. In the afternoon      the same buoyant group would pass us again, and as soon as      we straggled into the right's campsite, tea and biscuits      were served . . . followed soon thereafter by a delicious,      full-course meal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN EXOTIC, ANCIENT WORLD</strong><br />      However, if the trekking routine soon became comfortingly      familiar, our surroundings were a constant source of      surprise and delight. Almost every valley contains its own      ethnic group or mix of races-Newars, Limbus,      Chhetris, Sherpas, Tibetans, and Tamangs-each of      which has its own colorful dress, jewelry, customs, houses,      and temples.    </p>    <p>      Nature, too, offered rich and exotic rewards ... as we      climbed up from the fertile farmlands of the tropical      Tarai, through pines and oaks, and into misty, moss-covered      rhododendron forests whose 60-foot-high trees were just      beginning to put forth their showy blossoms. Candy-colored      birds sent us scrambling for binoculars and cameras, and      monkeys fought and screamed in the giant ferns. During our      visit to one small Tibetan village, young girls came to the      campfire and-without being asked-sang and      danced for us with a grace that was all the more amazing      for its spontaneity . . . while shadowy jackals raced past      just beyond the firelight and howled eerily at the swelling      moon.    </p>    <p>      Our legs-surprising many of us with their staying      power-took us high above the clouds, but the towering      peaks of Makalu and the Kanchenjunga range still loomed      ominously above us when we camped at 11,500 feet. And that      night a freak snowstorm, accompanied by slashes of      lightning and booming thunder, discouraged all but a hardy      few from struggling the next day-sometimes through      waist-deep drifts-to yet higher elevations.    </p>    <p>      On other days we plodded across the edges of rice paddies      that rose in terraced audacity for thousands of feet up the      sides of steep slopes . . . and passed through friendly,      prosperous mountain towns. (Upon leaving Chainpur, Nepal's      remote brassmaking center, we found that we had to hire      another porter to carry all the low-cost artwork we'd      bought. There, too, nearly 20 of our group enjoyed a tasty,      all-we-could-eat meal in a local restaurant ... for a total      bill of less than $10!) And it seemed that we had only to      pass a school to put an end to that day's classes:      Outsiders, you see, don't often visit the part of the      country through which we traveled, and our arrival was      usually an event celebrated by the whole village.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TREKKING FEVER</strong><br />      When we finally reached Tumlingtar's dirt airstrip, from      which a small twin-engine plane would fly us past Everest      and a string of equally magnificent peaks on the first leg      of our journey home, it was with wistful sadness that we      bade some of our new Nepalese friends goodbye. At that      point many of us remembered that on first arriving in the      fabulous, temple-strewn city of Kathmandu, we'd talked to a      couple who had just returned from a long trek of their own.      "We wish we were going back with you," they'd said,      but-with some worries about how we'd handle the often      grueling journey ahead-we had assumed they were just      being polite.    </p>    <p>      Well, we were wrong! There is a special magic about the      Himalayas ... a natural rhythm to life there that makes any      lack of modern-day amenities seem ridiculously unimportant      . . . and a great deal of truth in the saying, "You don't      change Nepal. It changes you." Therefore, we're glad to      tell you that from March 12 to April 1, 1983 we'll offer "A      Himalayan Spring Spectacular" trek.    </p>    <p>      At that time, the rhododendrons in the Annapurna region of      western Nepal, where we'll hike for over a week, should be      in full bloom. Better still, our second Nepalese tour will      include a raft trip down the Trisuli River to the Royal      Chitwan National Park, where we'll ride elephants on a      photo safari in search of rhinos, tigers, crocodiles, and      other wildlife. In short, we'll have opportunities to savor      as much of this remote kingdom's diverse culture, dramatic      topography, natural habitat, and adventurous challenge as      the three-week trip will allow! The tentative cost is      $2,750 (including airfare), and a $200 deposit will hold      your place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AND FURTHERMORE . . .</strong><br />      Of course, we wouldn't want to miss mentioning MOTHER'S      other upcoming tours (which we wouldn't sponsor if they      weren't equally special!): [1] "A Wild-Plant Walk in the      Alps", the best in Swiss and Austrian alpine scenery, with      Amsterdam's once-in-a-decade flower show thrown in for good      measure (June 11 to 27, 1982 . . . cost, $1,770 . . .      deposit $200). [2] "A Raft Trip on the Tatshenshini", a      true wilderness adventure on one of Alaska's most      spectacular rivers (August 15 to 26, 1982 . . . cost,      $1,490 ... deposit, $250). [3] "Biking China", a 21-day      bicycle trip through the Yangtze Valley in the People's      Republic of China (September 30 to October 20, 1982 . . .      cost, $2,978 . . . deposit, $300). [4] A repeat of our      "Energy Tour of France" (October 14 to 24, 1982 . . . cost,      $1,395 . . . deposit, $200). [5] A second "South Seas      Seminar" with Anne and Paul Ehrlich and John and Cheryl      Holdren (January 23 to February 6, 1983 . . . cost, $2,495      . . . deposit, $200).    </p>    <p>      To reserve a place on any of our expeditions, send your      deposit-by check or money order-to Mother's      Tours, P.O.
