                    <p>      Selected doin's of well-known MOTHER-types from around the      world.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONGRESSMAN JIM WEAVER</strong><br />      Every spring and fall, smokestacks smear the blue skies      over Oregon's forests with haze as thousands of tons of      logging slash are burned to clear the ground for      reforestation. The goal of Congressman Jim Weaver      (D-Oregon) is to turn that waste into useful energy . . .      and-at the same time-to create jobs and reduce      pollution.    </p>    <p>      Since much of the slash is produced on government-owned      forest lands, Mr. Weaver decided that government agencies      should take the initiative in reclaiming this resource. So      the legislator sponsored the Wood Waste Utilization Act      (which is now law) to provide monetary incentives which      will-it's hoped-prod such agencies as the      Forest Service to sell their waste slash to small      independent logging companies. The same agencies are now      also responsible for helping to make the slash-recovery      operations more profitable by researching new equipment and      methods.    </p>        <p class="credit">      PHOTO COURTESY OF JIM WEAVER    </p>    <p>      Once it's out of the forest, however, the slash still needs      to be used wisely. And to aid <em>that</em> effort, Jim      Weaver visited a privately owned woodwaste thermal plant in      California that produces electricity for a mere 4 cents per      kilowatt hour . . . and also provides 500 jobs based on a      Forest Service guarantee of a constant 30-year supply of      wood-waste. Impressed by what he saw there, the Oregon      lawmaker is now arranging funding for the establishment of      similar plants in his state, and working out a slash-supply      agreement with the Willamette National Forest. In      recognition of his efforts, the Wood Energy Institute      recently proclaimed Congressman Weaver the "Champion of the      West".    </p>    <p>      Jim has made energy conservation a part of his day-to-day      life, too. He's installed a solar water heater and had a      solar greenhouse added to his well-insulated home . . .      attached his stationary exercise bicycle to a battery      storage system . . . and plans to construct a wind      generator. His ultimate goal is to have an      energy-independent house in an energy-independent      state.- <em>Valerie Rapp.</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>AMORY AND HUNTER LOVINS</strong><br />      Amory and Hunter Lovins-the husband and wife team      whose concept of the "soft path" to a renewable technology      helped spark today's widespread interest in alternative      sources of energy-are the stars of a recently      released film called <em>Lovins on the Soft Path</em>      (Bullfrog Films, 1982) . . . a 36-minute documentary which      attempts to present the basic principles that, if followed,      could bring about an economically viable future. The film      poses three critical questions: How much energy do we need?      What kinds of energy? Where can we get it?    </p>    <p>      The point of the project is to make viewers aware of the      fact that-as Amory puts it-"We're in the      position of somebody that can't keep the bathtub full      because the water keeps running out. Before we buy a bigger      water heater, we ought to get a plug." (For a more detailed      look at Amory's theories, see the Plowboy Interview in      MOTHER NO. 48.)    </p>    <p>      The Lovinses-whose busy schedule as energy      consultants includes speaking engagements, environmental      research projects, and more-agreed to make the film      in order to bring their message to a greater audience and,      as the president of Bullfrog Films says, to encourage      "resourcefulness, thrift, community action, and democratic      decision-making". The production is available for sale in      16mm film or video-cassette form . . . and can also be      rented-in 16mm only-by schools, churches,      public libraries, industries, or civic groups for $75 (for      three days) plus shipping and handling.

TMEN, Oley, Pennsylvania 19547.-FM.    </p>    <p>      <strong>JUNIOR JOHNSON<br /></strong> Even those who live      "in the fast lane" sometimes need to retreat. And that's      probably why Junior Johnsonâ€“a race car builder and      former NASCAR driver-recently turned a 150-year-old      cattle barn into a peaceful Blue Ridge Mountain home for      himself and his wife Flossie.    </p>        <p>      After first carefully identifying each log with a numbered      tag, junior removed them from the livestock structure one      at a time and then reset them in the cabin in their same      positions. The 10"-thick logs are all interlocked by      hand-hewn notches and joined with cement mortar. To build      the house's foundation and two chimneys, the Johnsons      gathered ten tons of blue granite fieldstone from the      surrounding hills. Native oak and pine were used to form a      front porch, as well as the large overhead beams and pegged      floors <em>inside</em> the house. The couple also salvaged      planks from the old barn to build a pair of Dutch doors and      a massive bed headboard.    </p>    <p>      The cabin is surrounded by thick woods and a mountain      creek. And, in the fall, rows of cabbages and wild      mushrooms vie for space in the yard. Only their love of      racing lures the Johnsons away from their Appalachian      retreat: On Sundays, fans can watch Darrell Waltrip driving      one of junior's cars.- <em>Gail Pallotta</em> .    </p>    <p>      <strong>IN BRIEF . . .</strong><br />      TOM BROWN, JR. (author of MOTHER's "At Home in the      Wilderness" features) recently published a new edition of      his book <em>The Search</em> (Berkley Press, $5.95),      describing his year-long retreat into the wilderness ....      RENE DUBOS-well-known microbiologist,      environmentalist, and subject of the Plowboy Interview in      MOTHER NO. 6-died several months ago in New York City      .... The author of <em>The Passive Solar Energy Book</em>      (Rodale Press, 1979), EDWARD MAZRIA, is one of the      architects of a newly built solar-heated library in Mt.      Airy, North Carolina .... Companion bills designed to      control acid rain have been introduced in the House and the      Senate by Congressmen TOBY MOFFETT (D-Connecticut) and JUDD      GREGG (R-New Hampshire), and Senator GEORGE J. MITCHELL      (D-Maine).FM.<br />    </p>
