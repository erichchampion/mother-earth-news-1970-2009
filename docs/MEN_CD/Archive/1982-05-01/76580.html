                    <p>		  The Institute for Local Self-Reliance works to help      urban residents gain greater control over their lives      through the use of low-technology, decentralist tools and      concepts. Because we believe that city dwellers and country      folks alike can profit from the institute's admirable      efforts, we've made this "what's happening where" report by      the ILSR staffers one of MOTHER'S regular features. If      you'd like to know more, you can subscribe to the      organization's bi-monthly magazine, Self-Reliance, for      $8.00 ($15 for institutions) ... or become an associate      member for $25 ($17 of which is tax-deductible) and receive      both the magazine and a discount on other publications.      (For a free list of the institute's books and pamphlets,      just send a self-addressed, stamped envelope.) Write to      ILSR, Dept. TMEN, 1717 18th Street N.W., Washington, D.C.      20009.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, utilities were pretty much limited to      offering gas and electric service, but now there are a few      that help people make use of "alternative" energy sources      as well.    </p>    <p>      The municipal solar utility (MSU) concept was originally      intended to provide a new approach to financing and      marketing solar energy systems. And the first      one-established in 1976 in Santa Clara, California      -came into being when the city-owned electric utility      made solar pool heaters more attractive to customers by      allowing buyers to spread the purchase price over the term      of a lease.    </p>    <p>      The results so impressed the U.S. Department of Energy that      it gave a $112,000 grant to the California Energy      Commission (CEC) to expand the idea . . . and, since 1979,      CEC's Barry Saitman has been doing just that. Under his      guidance, the MSU program has been given considerable depth      and sophistication.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, even the phrase "municipal solar      utility" has now become a misnomer, since one of the first      actions taken by Saitman was to broaden the scope of the      program. Therefore, "municipal" now applies not only to      cities, but also to community organizations, homeowner      associations or condominiums, community development      corporations, profitmaking firms, and special-purpose      jurisdictions (such as school, water, irrigation, and      housing districts). And "solar" has come to serve as a      blanket term for various energy alternatives: conservation,      cogeneration, hydro, biomass, wind, and photovoltaics ...      as well as solar hot water systems.    </p>    <p>      In 1979 small grants were given to six cities-Palo      Alto, Ukiah, Santa Monica, San Dimas, Bakersfield, and      Oceanside-to take part in the first phase of the      program . . . and rarely has so much been accomplished with      so little money! Palo Alto has generated almost $2 million      in loans for solar systems and energy conservation measures      . . . Oceanside has attracted more than $15 million in      private investment capital to create a sophisticated solar      leasing program . . . seven local energy staff positions      have been established... and nine more jurisdictions have      entered the program's second phase since 1981.    </p>    <p>      But just why do we need MSU's? Well, to begin with, they      can provide a form of consumer protection service to ease      the fears of people buying into new technologies . . . help      raise capital on better terms than could be done by single      homeowners or business people . . . and allow the formation      of public/private partnerships that can overcome      traditional building regulations that might hamper      conservation and solar energy development. MSU's can also      help solve the problem of how to deliver sun-energy      technologies to low-income families or renters.    </p>    <p>      The California MSU program has compiled an extensive      collection of information about the legal, economic, and      political possibilities of MSU's. New housing developments      are currently using central solar generation arrays owned,      in common, by a homeownersâ€™ association. Cities are      issuing bonds to finance energy conservation and the use of      solar technologies.    </p>    <p>      And, though California is the only <em>state</em> with a      formal program that encourages this kind of activity,      communities in other parts of the country are getting in on      the action as well. For example, the city of Carbondale,      Illinois (population 27,000) established an MSU program in      January of 1982.    </p>    <p>      As we noted earlier, <em>municipal solar utility is      actually</em> too narrow a term . . . the concept has grown      and changed with the times. And, of course, the roles and      functions of traditional agencies are changing, too. Water      departments now harness the power of flowing water to      create electricity . . . sewage authorities generate      methane gas . . . sanitation departments burn garbage to      produce steam and electricity . . . and office buildings      install their own power plants. In the same way, an idea      that began with solar pool heaters in one California city      today embraces dozens of variations... as neighborhoods,      homeowners' associations, condominiums, cities, and other      organizations experiment with new forms to achieve greater      energy self-reliance.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For those who'd like to know more, the      Solar Office of the California Energy Commission (Dept.
