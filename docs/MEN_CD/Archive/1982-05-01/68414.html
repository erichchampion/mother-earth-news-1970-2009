        <p>"NEW" FUEL: Conservation effectively added more "new" energy to the total U.S. supply-between 1970 and 1980-than did oil, coal, nuclear power, hydropower, and natural gas combined . . . according to researchers at Oak Ridge, Tennessee's Institute for Energy Analysis. The scientists reached that conclusion by comparing actual energy use during that period to what the consumption <em>would</em> have been had energy demand increased as rapidly as did the gross national product over the course of the decade.</p><p>LIQUID WOOD: A researcher at Portland (Oregon) State University is said to have developed a technique for liquifying cellulose . . . without resorting to the complicated and expensive enzymatic degradation method currently considered the state of the art. In the new process, cellulose or bark chips are placed in a steel reaction vessel, a catalyst and hydrogen gas are added, and the blend is heated. The inventor says that the chemical process removes oxygen from the mixture, enhancing the energy yield of the remaining chemicals in the wood.</p><p>SOLAR STANDARDS: As we predicted in this column in Issue 74, California has mandated that flat-plate solar collectors, typically used to heat water, be tested and approved by one of two trade groups before the appliances' owners can qualify for tax credits. The tests will be performed on manufacturers' Inventories and will not involve the consumer. The state also expects to enact more stringent regulations for <em>other</em> solar devices in 1983.</p><p>AN ALTERNATIVE UTILITY? The North Carolina Alternative Energy Corporation-a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization-has been established by that state's utilities commission and is being primarily funded by Tar Heel utility customers. One purpose of the group is to inform Individuals, businesses, and government agencies about energy options, and to help them select the alternative sources best suited to their particular situations.</p><p>BACTERIAL ALCOHOL: The Bio-Diesel Fuel Company of Burlington, Iowa claims to be employing a newly discovered strain of bacteria to produce fuel-grade alcohol from cheese whey ... at a reputed cost of 10 cents per gallon. The firm first converts the carbohydrate solution into one containing glycerides . . . and then uses the new bacteria to turn the glyceride mixture into butanol.</p><p>RECORD RATE HIKES: From 1974 to 1979, total utility company rate increases in the United States averaged $2 to $3 billion a year, with 1980 showing an even higher jump ... of a record-breaking $5.9 billion. While the figures for 1981 aren't complete, rate hikes totaling $4.85 billion were approved during the first six months of that year. All of this translated into an average 15.5% increase in utility bills for U.S. residential consumers between mid-1980 and mid-1981.</p><p>HEAT BENEATH MY FEET: The Greater Pittsburgh International Airport has requested funds to undertake study on the feasibility of generating electricity from the heat being produced by an underground coal-mine fire on airport property.</p><p>ENERGY GOBBLERS: The Edison Electric Institute reports that four U.S. Industries require at least $250 of purchased power to produce $1,000 worth of their product. The heavy energy consumers are lime manufacturers, paperboard mills, makers of hydraulic cement, and producers of industrial gases.</p><p>TMI CLEANUP: Customers of Metropolitan Edison and Pennsylvania Electric Company will pay up to $37.5 million toward cleaning up the damaged reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility, according to a recent Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission ruling. What's more, consumers across the nation may have to ante up another $192 million ... if a plan proposing that sister utilities share in the TMI repair costs is approved by Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of the nation's privately owned utilities.</p><p>PEOPLE 1, NUKES O: Plans for building the proposed Black Fox nuclear plant near Inola, Oklahoma were halted permanently on February 16, 1982 . . . when the Public Service Company of Oklahoma withdrew its application for a construction permit for the facility. The action marked the end of a successful nine-year-long struggle by CASE (Citizen's Action for Safe Energy), a grassroots organization opposing the construction of the double-reactor plant.</p><p>Three U.S. companies recently introduced LAMP-DIMMING SYSTEMS -some of which adjust their electricity draw in proportion to the amount of available daylight-that are purported to save up to 80% in lighting costs. . . . The University of Idaho is investigating SAFE DISPOSAL METHODS FOR GEOTHERMAL WASTE after the liquid has been used to heat buildings or operate generators. Preliminary findings indicate that the hot water can harm the environment if it is discharged into lakes, streams, or aquifers. ... A Northeast Solar Energy Center study of 200 OWNERS OF PASSIVE SOLAR HOMES reveals that 86% are "very satisfied" with their houses, citing economic benefits, comfort, and aesthetics as the primary reasons for their favorable responses. . . . The Burlington (Vermont) Electric Company has started work on what may be the WORLD'S LARGEST WOOD-FIRED GENERATING PLANT . The $80 million, 50-megawatt facility-which will be used to cope with wintertime peak electric demands-will be fueled with woodwaste from the region's forest industry. . . . United Stirling of Sweden has successfully tested a solar-powered, 20-kilowatt external combustion engine which generates electricity THAT CAN BE FED DIRECTLY INTO POWER COMPANY LINES .</p>
