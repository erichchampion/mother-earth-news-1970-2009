                    <p>      <em>Here's yet another example of how "makin' do" can get a      job done.</em>    </p>        <p>      PHOTO BY THE AUTHOR    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wayne Fugate</strong><br />      Folks who enjoy fiddling with "nuts 'n' volts" often need      to make temporary electrical connections... and there's a      handy little item called a jumper that's designed to handle      just that job. (Even people who only occasionally deal with      electricity will almost certainly be familiar with the      large jumpers used to start cars.)    </p>    <p>      I needed one such connector a few months back. However, a      quick search through my toolbox revealed that I was flat      out of the ready-made units and, though I had plenty of      wire, even lacked the alligator clips that would have      allowed me to put one together quickly.    </p>    <p>      Well, the nearest electrical supply store was several      mountainous miles away... and while I couldn't justify      wasting the trip (and the fuel) for such a small purchase,      neither could I allow myself to weasel out of the job at      hand for lack of a simple component.    </p>    <p>      So, with a mixture of resignation and anticipation, I set      out to cobble together a homemade jumper. I began by      drilling two 1/8 "-diameter holes through one jaw of each      of a quartet of spring-type wooden clothespins. Then I      stripped an inch or so of insulation from the ends of two      four-foot lengths of soft, multistrand No. 12 copper wire.    </p>    <p>      To assemble the jumpers, I threaded a bare wire end through      each spring and pair of holes (as shown in the photo). The      end of the stripped wire was wrapped around the portion      going into the first hole, to secure the assembly. (I was      careful, though, to keep the bare wire from making contact      with the springs.)    </p>    <p>      I've found that my homemade jumpers work fine in all but      the tightest spots. And better still, the insulating      quality of the dry wood prevents shocks!    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMING UP</strong><br />      Electronics bulls will enjoy making MOTHER'S electric fence      powerpack. Full plans will appear in our next issue!    </p>
