        <p>In the scramble to find domestically available energy resources, the old standby-wood-has received a heck of a lot of attention lately. Unfortunately, the rampant and injudicious use of this combustible hangs like a double-edged sword above the head of humankind: Burned directly, especially on a large scale, wood could be a serious source of air pollution ... and its widespread unchecked consumption could have an impact on the environment in more direct ways as well. (After all, it takes a good many years to produce a single hardwood tree.)</p><p>Still, "woodburning" doesn't have to be a dirty word. In fact, the people at Wood Power Energy Corporation-in concert with the nursery firm of Miles W. Fry & Son-are taking some pretty impressive steps to demonstrate that cellulose combustion, when managed properly, can be both a practical and an economical alternative for "power hungry" Americans.</p><p>The Fry nursery folks, who are part of the "WoodPEC" group, are no strangers to long-time MOTHER-readers. (See "<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/1980-07-01/Hybrid-Poplar-Tree-Projects.aspx" target="_blank">Hybrid Poplars</a>",  and "<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/1981-03-01/Homemade-Motor-Fuel-From-Firewood.aspx" target="_blank">Homemade Motor Fuel ... From Firewood</a>".)  Back issue ordering information appears on page 148.) But the wood-powered, on-site energy system recently demonstrated by the WoodPEC organization takes the group's experiments in wood gasification one step further... and actually provides a sizable portion of the nursery's everyday energy requirements!</p><p>Greenhouses, you see, are costly to maintain ... particularly throughout the winter months. So the Pennsylvania-based group decided to modify its hothouse's <em>existing</em> oil-fired water-heating system to burn wood gas, by way of an automatically stoked, 1-1/2-million-BTU gasifier. Its 49-horsepower boiler easily supplies two 5,000-square-foot greenhouses (it's been designed to handle four such units), and a secondary heat recovery system insures that any normally wasted thermal energy gets recycled rather than dumped.</p><p>Economically speaking, the concept makes good sense, according to the frugal Keystone Staters: Not only did the new fuel source require, for the most part, minimal equipment changes (a gas-fired furnace would've required even less modification), but between 10 and 25% of its content is burnable hydrogen derived from moisture in the wood ... a resource that's not used in direct combustion. As a result, the gasifier system's efficiency may approach 90%, while conventional woodburning furnaces and boilers generally function at <em>two-thirds</em> that level (or less). Translated into dollars, the conversion means that the nursery's managers should be able to replace their current annual consumption of $55,000 worth of fuel oil with 300 tons of hybrid poplars, grown at a cost of $15,000. (This amount of furnace feed can be raised on two 25-acre "energy plantations" of marginal land, harvested in alternating years to allow regeneration.)</p><p>In addition to the woodgas-fired hydronic heating system, the WoodPEC folks have been testing a 650,000-BTU downdraft gasifier that's coupled to a 140-horsepower, 70-kilowatt AC generator. Without taking by-product credits for <em>secondary</em> heat recovery into account (and that salvaged energy amounts to 40% of the thermal requirements for one greenhouse), they've been able to produce electricity at about 8 cents per kilowatt-hour and hope to reduce that figure, eventually, to less than 6 cents.</p><p>And on a more conventional level, a direct-combustion, wood-fired, hot-air furnace is currently being used to deliver up to 800,000 BTU per hour-through a double-shelled exchanger and a simple network of perforated plastic-tube ducts-to a 30' X 170' hothouse structure ... while maintaining stack temperatures as low as 150°F!</p><p>By taking their energy needs "into their own lands", so to speak, the people at WoodPEC are well on their way to proving that self-sufficiency can work well ... especially when the goal is backed by a bit of plan(t)ing.</p>
