                    <p>      <em>The unusual tang of this edible flower might surprise      you!</em>    </p>        <p>      PHOTO COURTESY OF GEORGE W. PARK SEED COMPANY, INC.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Christopher Nyerges</strong><br />      As a long-time wild-foods enthusiast, I've collected edible      plants in all sorts of unlikely spots . . . but I'd never      harvested food from a <em>flower</em> garden until a family      friend introduced me to the attractive yellow orange      blossoms and round leaves of the common nasturtium (      <em>Tropaeolum majus</em> ). After being assured (and      reassured) that the plant was both edible and tasty, I      chomped down on a long, succulent stem. The flavor was      initially sweet, but as I continued to chew, it became hot      and peppery . . . like a radish. "Wow!" I thought, my eyes      watering and my sinuses opened wide. "That's <em>good!</em>      "    </p>    <p>      Since then, I've developed a real liking for the tang of      the nasturtium plant, and I use its leaves and flowers      (both of which are milder than the stems) in a variety of      dishes. Because they taste something like a spicy-as      is the case when the plant has bolted-watercress      (indeed, the botanical name for watercress is      <em>Nasturtium officinale</em> ), nasturtium leaves can be      added to any type of green salad ... or even sprinkled into      soups. Furthermore, when mixed with chives, both the leaves      and blossoms blend beautifully into omelets or potato      salad.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GROW IT...</strong><br />      This Peruvian native was introduced into Europe back about      1686. During the late 1700's, the famous Swedish botanist      Carolus Linnaeus noted the similarity in appearance between      the plant's brilliant flowers and the gold (and often      blood-stained) helmets-called <em>tropaea</em>      -worn by ancient Roman warriors . . . hence the Latin      name of <em>Tropaeolum</em> .    </p>    <p>      The popular annual flourishes in sandy soil (it's often      found growing wild along the Pacific coast of the U.S.) and      prefers full sun and well-drained ground. Both kinds of      nasturtium-there's a climbing variety and another      that looks like a ground cover-can become unruly if      they're left untouched . . . but most gardeners still enjoy      cultivating the plant for its striking appearance and easy      care. You'll find nasturtium seed at your local nursery:      It's usually available in double-or single-blossom      varieties . . . and in mixed colors or single shades. [      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Although the rest of the plant is safe      to eat, nasturtium seeds can be toxic.</em> ]    </p>    <p>      In addition to its pleasing flavor, the nasturtium is a      rich source of vitamin C . . . and is reputed to contain an      herbal equivalent of penicillin, which helps the body fight      off infections. It's an easy plant to cultivate, too . . .      and is, in fact, often recommended as a good starter flower      for beginning horticulturists.    </p>    <p>      <strong>...PREPARE IT ...</strong><br />      <em>Tropaeolum</em> cuisine, you'll discover, can be      surprisingly varied. The young seed pods, for example, are      commonly pickled and used as substitutes for capers . . .      while the greenery and blossoms make attractive garnishes      for any meal. Besides spicing up raw garden salads,      nasturtium leaves can be stuffed like grape leaves . . .      cooked and served as you would spinach (the dish goes well      with a garlic butter seasoning) ... or chopped up and      sprinkled into luncheon spreads.    </p>    <p>      For instance, here's a simple-to-prepare cheese spread      featuring the piquant flavor of the nasturtium's leaves.      You should make it just before serving, and be sure to have      all the ingredients ready before you begin, since the      foliage will turn bitter and the radishes will become soft      if they stand very long.    </p>    <p>      First, wash a bunch of small radishes thoroughly and remove      their tops. Cut a few of them into thin slices, and      coarsely grate the rest. Quickly chop up a table-spoon of      nasturtium leaves and blend them-along with the      grated radishes and a teaspoon of lemon juice-into      eight ounces of softened cream cheese. Slather the mixture      on thin slices of rye bread or pumpernickel, and top each      serving with a whole nasturtium leaf and a radish slice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>...AND SAVOR IT</strong><br />      The colorful red and green flecks, peppery flavor, and      crunchy texture of this uncommon sandwich spread will have      your guests wondering (probably out loud) just what it is      they're eating. You can keep your secret, though. Simply      tell them it's a nutritious, easy food . . . that you make      whenever you thin your flower garden!    </p>
