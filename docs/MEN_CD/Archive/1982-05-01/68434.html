                    <p>      <em>Small-plot growers can get their cultivating done more      easily if they simply take a step...</em>    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTOS    </p>        <p>      With full summer almost upon us, a lot of gardeners are      likely to find themselves viewing the old cropping grounds      with dwindling enthusiasm. The wonderful fantasies of last      winter's seed selection are past, and the magical ceremony      of planting is only a memory . . . but the backbreaking      task of regular <em>maintenance</em> looms bigger and      bigger by the day, and there are as yet precious few      harvestable vegetables to <em>reward</em> that labor. In      fact, it sometimes seems that that the gardener's every      free June and July minute is spent hunched over a hoe or a      wheel plow-eyes aching with sweat-in the effort      just to <em>keep up</em> with invading weeds.    </p>    <p>      Well, Mr. B.C. Armstrong doesn't claim that he can free you      from the task of weeding, but he does say that his      invention, the "Straddler" garden cultivator, will help      many people get that chore out of the way in less time and      with less effort than would otherwise be possible. B.C.      claims he's been aware of the inadequacies of the common      means of muscle-powered cultivation since his childhood . .      . when, presumably, he <em>spent</em> his midsummer      afternoons and weekends wrestling such tools around the      family garden. Those early experiences inspired him to      search for a better cultivator design . . . and after      looking over patents dating back to 19l4, he decided that a      device which would allow the gardener to walk backwards      could "make the best use of the weight and power of the      body".    </p>        <p>      The inventor patented his first cultivator in 1945 (see the      accompanying illustration). The design went through a      number of refinements and revisions over the years, but it      wasn't until after 1972-when B.C. retired-that      he was able to devote the time necessary to develop his      concept fully.    </p>    <p>      The result of that work is the somewhat odd-looking      implement shown in the photos. It consists of a two-part      shaft, a "push pad", and a handle-and-suspender assembly .      . . all of which can be adjusted to suit the physique of      the user.    </p>    <p>      Several of MOTHER's staffers put the Straddler through its      paces during the summer of 1981, and all were quite pleased      with the cultivator's design, ease of control, and light      weight. Of course, it would be quite a task to actually      <em>plow</em> a new bed with the Straddler (although it      could certainly be done, particularly in good soil) . . .      but when you're facing the charge of the crab grass or the      attack of the amaranth, you might just find that it is,      indeed, time to meet that challenge with a step backwards!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The basic Straddler is priced at $29      plus $5.00 shipping and handling. Optional attachments are      available, too, so would-be buyers might want to write for      more information-before ordering-to the      Straddler Cultivator Co., Dept. TMEN, 535 Westmoreland,      Jackson, Tennessee 38301. Please send $1.00 with your      inquiry to cover postage and handling expenses.</em>      </p>
