        	          <p>      <em>Here are a few "professional secrets that can help you      to find, identify, and sell antique bottles!</em>    </p>        <p>      Probe gently!    </p>    <p>      New dumps may cover old ones.    </p>    <p>      A sight to thrill any bottle collector.    </p>        <p>      Color is a clue to age and value (old glass is typically      purple, aqua, amber, or olive).    </p>        <p>      A treasure-hunter's reward!    </p>    <p>      <strong>TURN TRASH INTO TREASURE</strong><br />      <br />      <strong>Allan and Elizabeth Boyer</strong><br />      As almost anyone who tries to take advantage of farm      auctions, garage sales, and the like will already know, a      lot of yesterday's throwaways are considered      collectible-and valuable-today. And old      bottles, in particular, are experiencing a heyday of      popularity . . . even arousing (partly as a result of the      economic uncertainties of our day and age) the interest of      investors.    </p>    <p>      Now there's a pretty fair chance that some such heirlooms      might be found right in your own back yard. After all, a      good many of MOTHER'S readers are fortunate enough to live      on the sites of old-time homesteads, some of which have a      few of the original structures, which often mark prime      collecting areas, still intact. Furthermore, even if your      home <em>isn't</em> an ancient cabin or aging farmhouse,      chances are that people have been living on-or moving      across-your property for as long as 200 years . . .      and during that time they probably deposited their      discarded bottles, tins, broken dolls, and whatnot in a      number of hidden locations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE TO LOOK</strong><br />      Your great-grandma, like as not, threw her empty bottles      down the most popular disposal system of her day, the      outhouse ... so as not to leave shards to endanger barefoot      children. Flasks emptied of whiskey and other strong drink      (taken, no doubt, for medicinal purposes) were often      concealed inside the walls of barns, sheds, houses, and      privies.    </p>    <p>      But before you attack the planks of your home, barn, or      shed with a crowbar, bear in mind that it won't likely be      worthwhile to damage a usable structure . . . even if doing      so does turn up a rare bitters bottle. And, of course, that      rule is firmer still if you're on someone else's property.      Bottle-hunting protocol demands-first and      foremost-that you always obtain permission before you      prospect on another's domain.    </p>    <p>      In order to find potential "bottle mines", check some      topographical maps of your region to locate likely sites of      original homesteads: Look for level land, available water,      etc. Or explore country roads and watch for lonely standing      chimneys, or the spreading trees flanking an open spot,      that often mark deserted "house places". Talk to      old-timers, too. Their knowledge of long abandoned dumps,      businesses, and farms can be invaluable.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROSPECTING TECHNIQUES</strong><br />      Once you've identified a general locale that looks      promising, you'll have to try to figure out where people      might have unloaded their trash. Sometimes everyone in a      community had one chosen spot at which to leave refuse.      These dumps were frequently located in gulches or ravines,      and often downhill from a settlement . . . perhaps to      prevent seepage into wells, or maybe because it's easier to      haul trash <em>down</em> than up.    </p>    <p>      Of course, simply <em>finding</em> an abandoned garbage      heap isn't the whole story. You must then      determine-before devoting too much time to      digging-whether it's old enough to hold potential      value. The clues that most often signal a possible bonanza      include sun-purpled bits of glass, blue pieces of early      Mason jars, and the white porcelain liners from      old-fashioned zinc canning lids. Screwtop bottles will      indicate that the dump is anywhere from 30 years to mere      <em>days</em> old ... cork-stoppered purple flasks, on the      other hand, are an excellent sign that the trashpile is at      least 70 years old.    </p>    <p>      However, since recent rubbish may be covering up old      goodies, you <em>will</em> need to scratch around a bit and      make a test hole or two. But once you're convinced that      you've hit pay dirt, it's generally best to start      excavating at one end and methodically turn over the entire      area, shovelful by shovelful. (By simply potholing hither      and yon, you'll likely miss more bottles than you uncover.)      Dig gently, though, or your tool can smash what might have      been a valuable find!    </p>    <p>      <strong>BACKYARD DIGS</strong><br />      Not everyone will be fortunate enough to discover a major      untouched dumping ground, naturally, but virtually any old      homesite will likely have a long-covered toilet pit or two.      Outhouse locations can make easy and rewarding digs . . .      and they aren't even unpleasant to investigate after enough      years of bacterial action have worked their cleansing      wonders.    </p>    <p>      Privies were-as you'd imagine-usually located      handy to the house, and the sites were moved over at      frequent intervals, so you might well find half a dozen      searchable places side by side . . . earmarked by nothing      more than a slight depression or perhaps a few rotten      boards.    </p>    <p>      Now the same evidence may <em>also</em> mark a long-gone      shed or springhouse. You can, however, usually determine      whether the signs do indeed point to an outhouse location      by using a probe ... a ten-foot-long metal rod with a      T-shaped pounder that's much like a metal fencepost setter.      Ordinary unexcavated ground will probably be hard all the      way down, <em>and</em> may contain rocks, but the probe      will penetrate soft outhouse dirt like an icepick going      through warm butter.    </p>    <p>      Dry or contaminated wells are also likely sources of      valuable antique discards. You can make some great finds in      the old water holes, but <em>please remember</em> that they      were abandoned for a reason. It could be that the water      carried typhoid or that the walls were unsafe (and if they      were unsafe <em>then</em> , imagine how dangerous they must      be <em>now</em> ). Take all necessary precautions . . . you      don't want to get buried, drowned, or infected before you      can haul out the prize of the century!    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOLD OR GARBAGE?</strong><br />      After you've located a good spot and dug up a few old      relics, you've got the additional problem of deciding      whether your discoveries are worth cleaning up. Most items      will be what we call "leavers" . . . some will be "dammits"      . . . and a scant few will be the kinds of bottles      collectors covet. Leavers are best left right there where      you found them, unless they're not in an established dump      ... in which case you can do the environment a favor by      hauling them away. The typical dammit is a lovely, rare      container-perhaps even the find of a      lifetime-with a missing neck or a hole that renders      it worthless. (In the case of an <em>extremely</em>      valuable-if-it-weren't-damaged item, it might accurately be      referred to as an "O. Dammit" bottle.)    </p>    <p>      The first obvious clue to the age and value of a vessel      will be its color. Generally speaking, colorless glassware      is not really old, since bottle glass that holds its      clarity is a comparatively recent innovation, introduced      around the turn of the century. Old glass is typically      purple, aqua, amber, or olive. In addition, metallic oxides      were sometimes used to intentionally produce red, cobalt      blue, true blue, green, and yellow bottles . . . which are      often particularly rare and valuable.    </p>    <p>      Purple is the most common hue to be found in old glass,      since that color was typically used in widely circulated      patent medicine and whiskey bottles. Furthermore, from 1880      to 1914 manganese was used extensively to produce a      temporarily clear glass that had the unfortunate habit of      turning purple if exposed to the sun. The deeper the violet      hue in such glassware, the more manganese it contains (some      bottles are so purple that they appear almost black). And      although folks used to wrap their good crystal to      <em>prevent</em> such a change, it's a fact that the more      intense the shade, the more valuable the bottle today. (You      may find that you can deepen the color a bit by letting any      purple container or dish soak up the sun's rays for a few      weeks.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER CLUES TO VALUE</strong><br />      Bottles were originally hand-blown, either free-hand or      into a mold . . . until the invention of the Owens bottle      machine-about 1900-ended the careers of most      glass blowers. The Owens bottles, which are marked on the      bottom with a diamond inside a circle, lack character and      are mostly worthless in the marketplace.    </p>    <p>      Hand-blown bottles usually have uneven bottoms, because the      molten glass tended to run to one side. Another means of      identification is the jagged scar where the blowpipe was      removed from the still-hot glass shape. The bottoms of such      flasks may also be either torpedo-shaped or deeply      indented, and their necks are sometimes slightly askew.    </p>    <p>      Some of the best indications of a bottle's age can be seen      in its neck seams. A free-blown container will have no      seams at all . . . one blown into a mold will likely have a      seam partway up the neck (the lower the seam stops, the      older the bottle) . . . and, if the container was made in a      three-piece mold, there'll be a seam around the shoulder      <em>and</em> up each side, showing that the necks were      blown in their own molds and then applied. If the seam runs      all the way up through the lip, the bottle is at best from      the Owens machine.    </p>    <p>      The manner in which the lip was made and applied is an      additional clue to a bottle's age. On old free-blown      containers, the lip is sometimes just a crude blob or ring      of glass. In fact, the very oldest often have no lip at all      ... before 1840, blowers simply snipped the neck straight      across while the glass was still hot. The result was a      stovepipe effect, or perhaps a slight flare.    </p>    <p>      Around 1869 embossed lettering came into vogue and      continued to be popular until the invention of the Owens      machine and paper labels. Medical vials were usually      embossed with whimsical catalogs of complaints, cures, and      promises . . . and bottles with mistakes in spelling or      lettering are particularly cherished by collectors.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLEAN WITH CARE</strong><br />      Once you've uncovered your trophies and carted them home,      you'll be faced with the task of cleaning them. Be cautious      . . . just because a bottle has survived intact under tin      cans, rock, and horseshoes for nearly a century doesn't      mean it isn't fragile. In fact, after years of      deterioration, some containers become very porous and      brittle, and these delicate prizes may snap even if      subjected only to sudden temperature changes.    </p>    <p>      Use vinegar and water, steam-iron cleaner, and steel wool      pads to handle the scrubbing chores. Sometimes effective      but often <em>unsafe</em> are lye and acids. The caustic      cleaners <em>can</em> ruin valuable discoveries ... to say      nothing of clothes, shoes, and skin.    </p>    <p>      There's one type of "dirt" that'll defy all efforts at      removal. Afflicted receptacles-usually those found in      a damp place-are called "sick glass": They'll be      covered with a flaky, opalescent film that will stay in      place no matter what attempts are made to clean it off.      When you encounter this milky coating, you're probably best      advised to clean what you can and leave the rest alone,      because the opalization <em>can</em> occur in a variety of      interesting forms . . . appearing as iridescent colors or      beautiful etching. The value of the bottle may even be      enhanced if the "sick" colors are particularly vivid or the      etching has taken unusual forms.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT'S IT WORTH?</strong><br />      Of course, the one influence that will finally determine      the value of any of your unearthed treasures is the      timeless law of supply and demand. There are-for      instance-far too many unmarked beer, whiskey, and      patent-medicine bottles for many of them to be worth more      than a few dollars . . . if anything. (After all, during      the nineteenth century there were some 85,000 "patent"      cures on the market!)    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, when you begin trying to sell your colorful      artifacts, you'll soon discover that tastes vary widely.      Many people will gladly pay 50 cents to $2.00 for a little      colored jug that's all but valueless to collectors. As a      matter of fact, bushels of semi-worthless glass are sold,      at garage sales, to people who just want something unusual      to put a bunch of dried flowers in.    </p>    <p>      Generally speaking, old bottles rank in popularity and      value as follows: [1] historical and commemorative flasks,      circa 1810 to 1870 ... [2] bitters bottles from 1850 to      1906 . . . and then [3] whiskey, soda, poison, medicine,      and condiment containers.    </p>    <p>      The highest-priced historical items (often whiskey bottles)      are those embossed with designs that celebrate important      events, famous people, patriotic fervor, and so forth. Such      bottles are among the most expensive pieces of American      glass, usually selling for $10 to $800, but in rare      instances bringing even more. It's not unknown for an      individual to pull a $22,000 bottle out from under an      abandoned privy!    </p>    <p>      Bitters bottles now run a very close second, and may soon      surpass the historical flasks in popularity. The most      common and inexpensive of these are the containers that      were used by the Atwood, Hostetter, and Lash firms: They      sell for about $5.00. However, just the word "bitters"      embossed on a vessel is enough to bring <em>some</em>      money. (It's also a general rule that any container      exhibiting marks from the glass blower's pipe is worth at      least $5.00, regardless of other details.)    </p>    <p>      Since prices tend to fluctuate, it's impossible to lay down      any absolute values here. You can get <em>some</em> idea of      the market from bottle-pricing guides (although the books      may not be entirely accurate or up to date by the time you      read them). One very comprehensive example, among several      on the market, is John T. Yount's <em>Bottle Collector's      Handbook and Pricing Guide</em> (Educator Books, 1970 ...      $3.95 in paperback).    </p>    <p>      Potential buyers will often advertise their wants in the      bottle magazines and papers that have surfaced in recent      years ... including The <em>American Collector</em> (Dept.      TMEN, Drawer C, Kermit, Texas 79745 . . . $20 per year),      <em>The Antique Trader Weekly</em> (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box      1050, Dubuque, Iowa 52001 ... $19 per year), and Old Bottle      Magazine (Dept. TMEN, Box 243, Bend, Oregon 97701 ... $10      per year). You can use the periodicals' classified ad      departments to announce your finds, too. (Sample issues of      these magazines cost $1.00 each to the general public, but      only 50 cents to anyone who mentions THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS(restricted) in his or her request.)    </p>    <p>      It's a good idea to check <em>several</em> guides and to      shop around from collector to collector before you sell . .      . since the potential price of a "good" bottle will often      vary a great deal. Antique shops will typically offer less      money than will collectors, because the shops have to make      a profit, too. On the other hand, though, a dealer will      usually buy <em>more</em> of your goods than would an      individual enthusiast.    </p>    <p>      In short, while it's true that this sort of search for      hidden treasure isn't likely to make you rich, it's an      interesting-and often quite profitable-way to      spend some spare time. And for those of us who enjoy the      hunt, the sudden glitter of a bunch of bitters bottles in      an outhouse ruin can be almost as exciting as opening up      King Tut's tomb!<br />    </p>
