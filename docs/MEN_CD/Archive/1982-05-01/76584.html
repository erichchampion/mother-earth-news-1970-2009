                    <p>      <strong>PRESERVING GENETIC DIVERSITY:<br />      SEED BANKS</strong>    </p>        <p>      PHOTO STAFF    </p>    <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us-for      instance-have read Paul's book</em> The Population      Bomb) . . . <em>few people have any idea of how deeply the      Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research (the type that      tends to be published only in technical journals and      college texts). That's why we're pleased to present this      regular semitechnical column by these well-known      authors/ecologists/educators.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Paul and Anne Ehrlich</strong><br />      Humankind is fortunate that the extreme seriousness of the      loss of genetic variability of crops (the problem was      discussed in detail in our last column) is balanced by the      <em>relative</em> ease with which the situation could be      improved.    </p>    <p>      "Seed banks" can, you see, be used to preserve samples of      diverse crop strains, as well as populations of their wild      relatives. The seeds of most species will keep, in cold      storage, for a number of years before the majority of those      in each sample die. Every few years, then, it's necessary      to sow the saved seed, allow the plants to mature, and      harvest the seeds once again for storage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE NEED AND THE REALITY</strong><br />      However, although seed banks are simple in principle, their      operation requires skill and care. The preservation of      samples often amounts to little more than allowing the      process of natural selection to choose those seeds that      most readily survive the storage conditions. Unfortunately,      seeds that survive well in storage don't necessarily      produce plants with the characteristics that are most      useful to farmers.    </p>    <p>      The rate which a plant strain undergoes selection for      survival in storage can, however, be retarded by frequent      planting out. But it’s also important that seeds be      region from which they came… or at least under      conditions very similar to those that occur in the home      area. Otherwise, the strains will lose their unique      characteristics, because-once again-selection      will gradually adapt them to their new environment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UNDERFUNDED AND UNPLANTED</strong><br />      A recent survey, conducted by the government's General      Accounting Office (or GAO), found that seed-bank operations      in the United States leave much to be desired. Our nation's      main facility is the Department of Agriculture's National      Seed Storage Laboratory at Fort Collins, Colorado. Smaller      collections are held by various federal and state      experiment stations and by commercial seed companies.    </p>    <p>      The Fort Collins laboratory is currently filled to      capacity. It contains more than a quarter-million stored      seed samples, but only about half are catalogued so that      they're accessible to plant breeders, and the information      on many samples is inadequate. Worse than that, the      refrigeration equipment suffers periodic breakdowns, and      funds aren't available for growing out the seeds as      frequently as that should be done.    </p>    <p>      For example, the bank's large collection of seeds home      <em>guayule</em> , a plant with high potential as a new      source of natural rubber, hasn't been planted out since      World War II, and it's very likely that <em>all</em> of      those seeds have died by now. Indeed, well under half of      the seeds of any planting from the facility's collections      normally germinate, since they've had to endure too long a      wait before being sown. Such low survival rates, of course,      imply strong selection for storage characteristics.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A "NATIONAL DEFENSE" PRIORITY</strong><br />      Overall, the GAO found that there was no effective      seed-bank system in the nation, and that centralized      management was badly needed. As you'd likely imagine, the      niggardly level of funding for these crucial operations is      near the core of the problem. At present, the federal      government spends a total of about $12 million a year on      germ plasm collection and storage. . . which is less, in      constant dollars, than was spent in 1967! Worse, the Reagan      administration may well cut funding even further.    </p>    <p>      Now it seems to us that the productive capacity of American      agriculture is clearly an important facet of the security      of the nation. Not only does it abundantly feed our people,      but the surplus production available for export provides a      major portion of the foreign exchange needed to purchase      oil (among other things). Yet each year the United States      devotes only about <em>6% of the cost of a single B-l      bomber</em> to preserving the irreplaceable genetic base of      our crops!    </p>    <p>      Indeed, for the cost of two such bombers (they run about      $200 million apiece), a network of perhaps 20 experiment      stations, each superbly equipped for gene conservation,      could be established worldwide. And for an annual      expenditure equal to the cost of only three F-18 fighters      (at approximately $30 million each), those stations could      be very well staffed with plant geneticists, botanists, and      support personnel.    </p>    <p>      A well-managed system would have field crews constantly at      work making seed collections (each of which would be      accompanied by careful notes on the source plants), while      continual planting and reevaluation would insure that the      quality of the stored samples did not deteriorate with      time. A computerized data storage and retrieval system      could be used to connect all the stations . . . providing      both easy access to material by users and control of      distribution, so that key strains would be represented at      several stations to guard against accidental loss.    </p>    <p>      In addition to running the entire network of stations, the      hypothetical budget proposed above would be able to support      appropriate local crop subsidy programs. With the      experiment stations coordinating such a system, farmers      would be paid to grow some traditional crop strains in      place of present high-yield varieties. This practice would      assure that extensive plantings of the older strains were      always present in agro-ecosystems, providing a key backup      for the seed-bank operations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WORLDWIDE BENEFITS</strong><br />      And who-you have every right to demand-would      pay for all this? As indicated, the United States      government could easily afford to do so with only a slight      shift in priorities . . . and it would be one of the best      "national defense" investments we could make.    </p>    <p>      But it would be even more reasonable to run such a network      as an international enterprise. All rich nations should be      eager to participate on a fair-share-of-GNP basis. The      Soviet Union, for example, would not only find such a      system invaluable to help brace up its own-currently      faltering-agriculture, but also reap benefits through      the improvement of American crops, on which it on often      heavily depends.    </p>    <p>      Poor nations should also participate. In fact, many of the      experiment stations should be located in less developed      countries (LDC's). For one thing, such lands are the      sources of many wild relatives of today's important crops.      Most poor nations, moreover, have had increasing difficulty      feeding their rapidly growing populations and would profit      from research to develop <em>new</em> crop sources from      wild plants ... an effort that will require careful genetic      husbandry to succeed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BENEFITS FOR LESS DEVELOPED      COUNTRIES</strong><br />      LDC's would benefit from the employment of LDC scientists      and local laborers, as well. Furthermore, the stations      could serve as on-site research and training centers in      plant genetics and conservation, which would be of great      value to researchers from other parts of the world.    </p>    <p>      In capitalist countries, seed companies might be expected      to contribute to the cost of maintaining the system of      stations, probably by paying fees for the use of the      program's information systems and samples. Major      international seed and/or grain companies might also help      support research and preservation efforts in LDC's. Thus,      there are equitable ways that the relatively small costs of      the system could be shared.    </p>    <p>      Preserving the genetic diversity of crops is, of course,      just one part of the crucial goal of preserving the      diversity of <em>all</em> life on Earth. But it's a task      for which the immediate need is evident . . . one that      humanity knows how to perform and one that can be done at a      reasonable cost. Because every delay can result in the loss      of irreplaceable resources, failure to start at once is      insanity.    </p>    <p>      <em>Some of the information in this article comes from John      Walsh, "Genetic Vulnerability Down on the Farm" (Science,      vol. 214, pages 161-164, October 9, 1981) and from Ann      Crittenden, "U.S. Seeks Seed Diversity as Crop Assurance"      (New York Times, September 21, 1981).</em>    </p>    <p>      From January 23 to February 6, 1983 Anne and Paul Ehrlich,      and their friends and colleagues John and Cheryl Holdren,      will join MOTHER for a sunny South Pacific Seminar on the      idyllic islands of Tahiti, Bora Bora, Rangiroa, and      Huahine.
