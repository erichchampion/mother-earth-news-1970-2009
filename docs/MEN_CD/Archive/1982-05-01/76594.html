                    <p>      The life-bringing hand of spring has worked its magic in      the garden . . . and carefully shaped beds now present a      living mosaic of vibrant greens. Sample the first produce,      and-in doing so-reclaim some of the energy      you've put into your soil. Then spend healing hours among      the rows... remembering that the gardener's footsteps are      the world's best fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOOD THINGS IN SMALL PACKAGES</strong><br />      Now that the first flush of seed ordering, garden planning,      and planting is pretty much over, many folks have      undoubtedly had a few second thoughts about this year's      garden. It seems that there are always varieties we want to      try but somehow don't get around to ordering . . .      plantings of saved seeds that don't germinate as well as we      expected them to... and unused corners of the growing      ground that could easily hold just a couple of plants.    </p>    <p>      Of course, it'd be wasteful to order a packet of 200 seeds      when you really need only five or ten (especially if the      seeds are of a type that doesn't "keep" well), so the      last-minute "by chance" planting opportunities are often      missed. Well, a trio of seed merchants must have thought      that was a pity, because they've come up with a thrifty      answer to the "feast or famine" problem: the compact      packet.    </p>    <p>      Le Jardin du Gourmet (Dept. TMEN, West Danville, Vermont      05873), Pine-tree Seeds (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 1399,      Portland, Maine 04104), and the Broom Seed Company (Dept.      TMEN, P.O. Box 236, Rion, South Carolina 29132) are all      offering small, inexpensive packages of seed that are just      the ticket for late-season plantings.    </p>    <p>      The Green Mountain State firm has an across-the-board      20 cents price on its packets, and the Maine company      charges 20 cents to 45 cents for its wares, while the      southern firm has prices ranging from 20 cents to 50 cents      (and even offers two "complete garden" packages that allow      you to sow a 20' X 30' patch-complete with hybrid      varieties-for a total cost of less than $5.00).<br />      By the way, all three companies will send out their      catalogs at no charge . . . and the Jardin du Gourmet      listing also includes a rare and tasty offering in addition      to its seeds: genuine Vermont maple syrup in <em>all      four</em> grades (Fancy, A, B, and C).    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTOS    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOWAN ORIENTAL PLOT</strong><br />      If you'd like to take a wok in your garden and gather the      makings for a fine Far East feast, there's another small      seed company that you'll be happy to know about.    </p>    <p>      Sunrise Enterprises (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 10058, Elm-wood,      Connecticut 06110) offers a wide variety of seeds for      Chinese vegetables-some that are familiar and others      that are not so well-known-including eight kinds of      Chinese cabbage and eight <em>other</em> Oriental      brassicas, edible burdock, and garland chrysanthemum.    </p>    <p>      And, to learn more about some of the less common varieties      of Oriental vegetables, you can order an 18-page bulletin      from the Suffolk County Cooperative Extension Association      (Dept. TMEN, 246 Griffing Avenue, Riverhead, New York 11901      ... you'll need to enclose $2.00 for the pamphlet). In      addition to pictures, descriptions, and cultural      information on Chinese radishes, bitter melons, and other      Far East fruits and vegetables, the thorough publication      also provides a dandy seed-source listing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GLEANINGS</strong><br />      Plans that will enable you to convert your wheelbarrow into      an inexpensive fertilizer spreader are available, free,      from the Department of Agriculture. According to its      designers, the tool enables two people to apply <em>six      tons</em> of fertilizer to <em>24 acres</em> in just two      days! You can request the plans by writing to Richard F.      Dudley, Building 303, Beltsville Agricultural Research      Center, Dept. TMEN, Agricultural Research Service, USDA,      Beltsville, Maryland 20705 . . . enclose a self-addressed,      stamped envelope, and let the folks there know that you      appreciate their interest in equipment scaled to the needs      of small family-operated farms.    </p>    <p>      The USDA has also recently been studying the biological      control of greenhouse pests. Its researchers have      discovered that the Insidious Flower Bug (now there's a      name!) will gobble up 53 varieties of other insects and      mites . . . and it's especially effective against thrips,      two-spotted spider mites, and greenhouse white-flies. More      observation is needed to determine whether our insidious      ally can develop and reproduce in a greenhouse environment,      but the agency has discovered two other insects that can do      so, and are also effective in the fight against hothouse      pests. A predatory mite, <em>Phytoseiulus persimilis</em> ,      reliably controls spider mites . . . and a parasitic wasp,      <em>Encarsin formosa</em> , is effective against      whiteflies.    </p>        <p>      The antique White Cushaw pumpkin is ideal for modern      gardens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OF HEIRLOOM QUALITY</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Judging from the response we received when-a      couple of years back-we printed an article on growing      antique apple varieties (see MOTHER NO. 63, page 130), you      folks have a great deal of interest in our gardening (and      culinary) heritage. And with the concentration of ownership      of seed companies in the hands of giant conglomerates, more      people are beginning to be concerned about preserving the      germ plasm that we'd need to breed new cultivars if disease      should strike down some of our monoculture-planted crops      (see this article for further discussion of this problem).      Then, too, many gardeners are discovering that a goodly      number of the old vegetable varieties were abandoned not      because they didn't taste good-they were often      superb-but simply because they weren't suited to the      needs of mechanical agriculture.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Well, It turns out that Roger Kline, of the Vegetable      Crops Department at Cornell University, has been      researching America's heritage crops, and he's written      (with the help of Robert F. Backer and Lynne Belluscio) a      pamphlet called The Heirloom Vegetable Garden. The brochure      describes the varieties you would have found growing in a      typical mid-nineteenth century garden plot, including      Warted Crookneck summer squash and Boston Marrow winter      squash ... Black Mexican and Stowell's Evergreen sweet corn      ... and Early Jersey Wakefield and Drumhead Savoy cabbage.      You can obtain a copy of the pamphlet by sending $3.00 to      the Distribution Center, Dept. TMEN, 7 Research Park,      Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14850. Ask for      publication IB-177. And if you'd like to carry your      research a little further, you can order seeds for 35      heirloom varieties, plus a sample garden layout, for $10      postpaid-or the seeds and the brochure for $12      postpaid-directly from Mr. Kline (Dept. TMEN,      Vegetable Crops, Cornel! University, Ithaca, New York      14850). Other sources of heirloom vegetable seeds are those      twin pillars of the California seed business: the Redwood      City Seed Company (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 361, Redwood City,      California 94064 . . . catalog 50 cents) and J.L. Hudson,      Seedsman (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 1058, Redwood City,      California 94064... catalog $1.00). Both firms offer seeds      that represent our Indian heritage, too, including      varieties grown for centuries by the Zapotecs of Mexico.      Another good source of antique varieties-especially      for northern gardeners-is Johnny's Selected Seeds,      Dept. TMEN, Alb/on, Maine 04910. Good growing!</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>GARDENERâ€™S BOOKSHELF</strong><br />      There's a fine crop of new garden books waiting to be      picked for your spring and summer reading. The folks who      just about <em>invented</em> the begonia (in this country,      at least), Ed and Millie Thompson, have distilled their 25      years of experience into a definitive new work called      <em>Begonias: The Complete Reference Guide</em> (it costs      $35, from the Thompsons, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Drawer PP,      Southampton, New York 11968). Now $35 is a considerable sum      to spend for any book, and perhaps your local library will      order the volume. But the guide is also just what its title      claims-complete-and it's all but essential for      anyone who's serious about growing begonias... so you might      well want to start saving your pennies!    </p>    <p>      The good folks at <em>Tilth</em> , the nonprofit      organization dedicated to furthering biological agriculture      in the Northwest, have done much to be proud of... and now      a new book can be added to their list of accomplishments.      <em>The Future Is Abundant: A Guide to Sustainable      Agriculture</em> ($11.9 plus $1.00 shipping and handling      from Tilth, Dept. TMEN, 13217 Mattson Road, Arlington,      Washington 98223) is edited by Larry Korn, who also edited      Masanobu Fukuoka's <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> (see      MOTHER NO. 52, page 80). The work attempts to adapt the      ideas of Fukuoka and Bill Mollison (author of      <em>Permaculture</em> , and the subject of the Plowboy      Interview in MOTHER NO. 66), among others, to the specific      conditions found in North America. Although aimed at folks      in the Pacific Northwest, <em>The Future Is Abundant</em>      contains information that'd be of use to anyone interested      in organic agriculture.    </p>    <p>      Also specifically intended for western readers is the      latest in the HP Books series of beautifully illustrated      garden manuals: <em>Western Fruits, Berries, and Nuts: How      to Select, Grow, and Enjoy</em> (available for $7.95 from      most bookstores, or-with an extra dollar for shipping      and handling-from HP Books, Dept. TMEN, Box 5367,      Tucson, Arizona 85703). Authors Robert Stebbins and Lance      Walheim provide detailed information on raising such      mouthwatering crops as apples, apricots, avocados,      cherries, citrus fruits, figs, olives, peaches, persimmons,      pomegranates, and quinces... as well as almonds, pecans,      walnuts, filberts, pistachios, and macadamia nuts.    </p>    <p>      Finally, yet another rather expensive volume ($24.95) has      recently been published that's certainly worth a place on      your local library's shelves . . . and perhaps in your home      bookcase, too. <em>Natural Landscaping: Designing With      Native Plant Communities</em> is a detailed examination of      the major alternative to the traditional (and, many think,      <em>sterile</em> ... as well as energy-intensive) manicured      lawn. Authors John Diekelmann and Robert Schuster explain      the techniques involved in designing and planting      landscapes composed of native species . . . with the goal      of enhancing the attractiveness of our surroundings,      conserving our environmental resources, and reducing the      cost of landscape maintenance. There's an excellent      discussion of the soils, climates, and plant communities of      the northeastern and midwestern states . . . and some      terrific color photos that will sell you on the idea in a      moment. <em>Natural Landscaping</em> is published by      McGraw-Hill, and is available from many bookstores. (By the      way, any midwesterners who are planning to plant an      "unlawn" would do well to write to Prairie Seed Source,      Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 83, North Lake, Wisconsin 53064-or      P.O. Box 1131, Des Moines, Iowa 50311-and enclose      $1.00 for a catalog. The firm offers wildflower mixtures      for wet mesic, mesic, dry mesic, and dry soils.)    </p>
