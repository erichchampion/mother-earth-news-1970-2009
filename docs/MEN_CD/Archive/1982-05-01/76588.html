        <p><em>The worldwide organization called Friends of the Earth is one of the most effective environmental groups in existence today, and the activities of FOE-along with a broad range of other news concerning ecological developments-are described each month in its publication titled Not Man Apart. You can become a member of Friends of the Earth, and receive the excellent tabloid, by sending $25 ($12 for students and retired people)-or $15 for a subscription only-to FOE, Dept. TMEN, 124 Spear Street, San Francisco, California 94105. And to increase the reach of the organization's doings, we've arranged to bring you this bi-monthly column, which is prepared by the staff of FOE/NMA.</em></p><p>For years, one of the toughest problems facing nuclear power advocates has been to come up with a reasonable means of disposal for the spent fuel rods and other contaminated materials that atomic plants produce. Millions of tons of the high- and low-level wastes are now piling up in temporary storage areas while waiting for more permanent homes . . . and many states have already made it very clear that they have no intention of letting any of those final resting places be within their borders.</p><p>Unfortunately, our current pronuclear administration didn't find it all that hard to locate a disposal site. Last September the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) actually began moves to lift the 12-year-old ban on issuing ocean dumping permits for low-level radioactive waste and other toxic substances.</p><p>As you may remember, from 1946 to 1970 nearly 100,000 barrels of low-grade wastes were unloaded at more than 50 sites off the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf Coasts. Worse yet, the Navy, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and other dumpers were so certain that the oceans would harmlessly scatter the radioactivity far and wide that they didn't even bother to design durable containers or to keep accurate records of the contents and locations of the barrels. However, in 1970 the AEC suddenly became concerned that increased radioactivity would affect the food chain, and stopped granting dumping permits.</p><p>Then, several years ago, preliminary surveys done by the EPA off the San Francisco and Maryland/Delaware shores (the two largest dump sites) revealed that many of the containers had long since broken open. The agency also found that the low-level radioactivity <em>did</em> not disperse throughout the ocean. Rather, it concentrated in the sediment nearby . . . which is, of course, a feeding ground for many local marine organisms. Fish in the area were, in fact, found to be contaminated, but the EPA concluded that the <em>levels</em> of contamination weren't high enough to warrant public concern.</p><p>Well, environmentalists, health officials, and members of Congress from both East <em>and</em> West Coast states couldn't have disagreed more . . . since, at present, no one really knows how much or how quickly radioactivity is transmitted through the marine food chain and then to people. Consequently, opponents of dumping are now urging the government to thoroughly monitor all <em>existing</em> sites before creating any more potential problems.</p><p>However, the general accounting office (GAO)-the agency that conducts investigations for Congress-responded to that public and official concern by stating, in a recent report, that "the hazards of past waste dumping have been overemphasized". It went on to recommend that the EPA ignore previous sites entirely, since the records on such dumps are so incomplete, and start drawing up new guidelines for monitoring future disposal areas.</p><p>And the following operations-which are already in the works-indicate that the GAO's recommendations have been taken as a green light to resume dumping.</p><p>The Navy plans to sink 100 decommissioned nuclear submarines in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (sites have already been targeted off California's Cape Mendocino and North Carolina's Cape Hatteras). Each sub is estimated to contain 50% more radioactive waste than did <em>all</em> the low-level material dropped into the oceans to date.</p><p>The Department of Energy is spending $6.2 million a year to develop a seabed disposal program for high-level radioactive wastes. The project is assessing the feasibility of burying the castoffs from weapons production and nuclear reactors in ocean-bottom sediments some 15,000 feet deep. Disposal operations could begin in the north Pacific within 20 years, and project directors say that, if the program is successful, the eastern seabed could become a repository, as well.</p><p>Lifting the dumping ban will also open the ocean to disposal of other toxic substances. For example, according to the EPA, it may be wiser to burn 298,000 tons of toxic chemicals annually off the Delaware/Maryland and New Jersey shores than on land . . . despite the possibility of lethal spills en route to the sites, and the uncertain long-term effects of the burning.</p><p>In an attempt to reverse such trends, State Senator Barry Keene of northern California introduced-last January-Senate Joint Resolution 27, which calls for the President and Congress to ban radioactive waste dumping off the California coast. Keene's measure also asks the EPA and other federal agencies to monitor <em>existing</em> dump sites. If you live in a coastal state, you might urge your state legislators to introduce similar resolutions. Others can direct their concerns to Representative Norman E. D'Amours, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oceanography, Dept. TMEN, Washington, D.C. 20515.</p><p><strong>SOME GOOD NEWS</strong><br />The U.S. is now prepared to return to the international Law of the Seas Conference . . . after having walked out on the treaty negotiations last August, leaving the proceedings in a turmoil. The U.S. withdrawal was prompted by the Reagan administration's opposition to the most important sections of the treaty-the deep-sea mining provisions-which delegates from 150 nations have been trying to hammer out for more than ten years.</p><p>At the conference's final session this year, U.S. delegates will work to relax those aspects of the treaty that Mr. Reagan claims aren't in the best interests of the U.S., including those provisions dealing with the establishment of a global authority to govern deep-sea mining . . . limitations on mineral extraction to protect producers throughout the world . . . and the requirement that mining companies sell their technologies at "reasonable terms" to the global authority, allowing developing countries to benefit from them. While the administration and the Pentagon claim that they can take or leave the treaty, U.S. mining companies must be wishing <em>they</em> could say the same: Such firms need an international treaty in order to secure financing for deep-sea mining ventures.</p><p>On other fronts, the Harris Poll that we reported on in the last issue of MOTHER (the study indicating that 75% of the public supported a strong Clean Air Act) apparently didn't convince the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . . . which decided to conduct a more thorough survey of its own. Well, once again-and Mr. Harris must have enjoyed the outcome-the majority (63%) of those polled either found the present cost of air pollution control acceptable or favored <em>increased</em> regulation. And 30% opposed air pollution of any kind!</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Here are two last-minute developments that we'd like to report on briefly: First, the urea-formaldehyde insulation ban proposed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) last year was passed in late February, despite heavy opposition from the National Insulation Certification Institution. The CPSC concluded that there were no installation methods which could guarantee low exposure of occupants to the material . . . which is known to cause headaches, eye irritation, nausea, and respiratory ailments and is a suspected carcinogen.</em></p><p><em>In another move, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed to relax limitations on the lead content of gasoline. The present Clean Air Act stipulation limits refinery, use of lead as an octane booster to an average of 0.5 grams per gallon, while the proposed rule would either loosen or rescind that requirement. Concerned groups claim that automobiles are the single largest source of lead in the environment today . . . and that increased use of the additive will only aggravate the acknowledged problem of the learning disorders in children that have been shown to result from even low concentrations of the element. See the article on page 24 for information on this and on other actions that might be taken... by Congress in the coming months.</em></p>
