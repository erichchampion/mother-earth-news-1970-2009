        <p class="caption">Locate the frame's inner face (that nearest the bark and opposite to the split log faces). Mark the inner face as shown above and shave the two ends and center to give easier bending. Gradually bend the frame to rest inside the form blocks and drive in the wedges. (Steaming or soaking the staves may help the bendingâ€”see page 24.) The frame is now snug against the shoe form. Dry for several weeks.</p>
