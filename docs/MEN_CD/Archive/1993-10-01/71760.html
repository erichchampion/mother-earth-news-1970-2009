Don't waste your good bran; bury      beer cans in the ground.</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Frame Your Fence    </h3>    <p>      Just received my issue with the cover story about wood      fences (issue #138), and thought I'd offer this suggestion,      which worked out great for me. For an easy and pretty gate,      find yourself a fancy bedframe end (people throw these away      once in a while, so look around) and put two coats of paint      on it. Then just put it between two 4x4's, and you've got      yourself a gate. This will work for wire fence too.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Nick Terrell</em><br />      <em>Hoopeston, Illinois</em>    </p>    <h3>      Improve Your Glove Life    </h3>        <p>      To remove pesky lids from hard-to-open jars, cut the      fingers off of latex dishwashing gloves. (You can throw      these fingers away.) The rest of the glove makes the      perfect grabber that will effectively loosen almost any of      lid.    </p>    <p>      Also, here's a good and environmentally friendly recipe I      recently came across that cleans brass and copper:    </p>    <p>      <em>1 1/4 cup baking soda</em><br />      <em>5/8 cup salt</em><br />      <em>5/8</em> <em>cup flour</em><br />      <em>2 tablespoons vinegar<br />      1/2 cup water</em>    </p>    <p>      Combine ingredients in a bowl. Then apply with a cloth,      scrub surface, and rinse.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Andre Ball</em><br />      <em>Montreal, Canada</em>    </p>    <h3>      The Taste Gardens Love    </h3>        <p>      If you own dogs, or other pets, you probably worry about      spreading chemical fertilizers on your lawn; try using      soybean meal. While it's not a complete fertilizer, it is      high in nitrogen and it helped our grass "green up" nicely.      It's also considered by many to be one of the finest soil      conditioners available, so you may want to try it in your      gar den too. You can find soybean meal at most feed stores.      I recommend using several light applications instead of one      heavy one. The only problem I've found is that our dog      likes to munch on it (soybeans are actually used in many      dog foods).    </p>    <p>      <em>-Tom Fulcher</em><br />      <em>Glenelg, Maryland</em>    </p>    <h3>      Cucumber Combat    </h3>        <p>      I don't use any fertilizers or pesticides or poisons of any      kind. Why should I? Nature has everything we need for every      purpose: Roses, for example, love garlic. I have planted      many gorgeous rose bushes with nothing but garlic cloves      planted around the bush and in the rich soil. Fire ants eat      fleas, so at least there's something good about them. If      fire ants become a nuisance, however, place a few cu cumber      peels around their mound-it destroys the entire      mound. And I sprinkle baby powder along the screen doors      and windows to set up a barrier that ants will not cross.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Lauren Turner<br /></em> <em>Atlanta,      Georgia</em>    </p>    <h3>      Creative Can Recycling    </h3>    <p>      While reading the April/May issue, I ran across "A Healthy      Slug Remedy" (Lore, issue #137). It sounds like a good idea      and undoubtedly works very well, but I think my better half      would kill me for using up all the bran for such purposes.      Now, I like to drink beer, and there is always that last      swallow in the bottom of the can that won't come out. So I      bury the can in the ground, all but two inches from the      top. The next day it's full of slugs that got in but      couldn't get back out.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jim R. Sauberan<br /></em> <em>Cuba, New      York</em>    </p>    <h3>      Inflating Your Sprayer    </h3>        <p>      I am an organic-pepper grower who can't afford expensive      powered sprayers and find that pump sprayers wear out my      arm after a lot of pumping. So I came up with a great idea:      I made my air compressor do the pumping for me. I drilled a      1/2" hole in the shoulder of my pump sprayer and then      pushed a rubber, tire-valve stem through. It cost about a      buck and really does the trick. You do have to be careful      about not overinflating your sprayer. I know this because I      did, and my sprayer split along the seam. Most will take 45      to 60 pounds per square inch, and some of the new ones have      a relief value that makes things easier. I usually fill my      sprayer <em>3/4</em> full so I don't have to make a trip      back to the air compressor.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Daniel McMillen</em><br />      <em>Nevada, Texas</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note:</em> <em>MOTHER's</em> <em>Country Lore      section is a great chance for you to share your practical,      down-home solutions to life's most frustrating problems.
