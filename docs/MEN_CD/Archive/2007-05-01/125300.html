        <p>Recently you may have heard the terms 'ecotherapy,''nature-based therapy' or 'nature deficit disorder.' They havesurfaced in response to research that shows humans have a basicneed to be in touch with the world around them; that contact withnature and wildlife promotes both mental and physical well-being.Everyday we feel a pull to nature in one way or another, through adesire to gaze at the night sky, study a stately hawk or appreciatethe change of a season. Upon seeing a turtle inch across a busyroad, we take time from our ridiculously busy lives and stop tohelp him out before continuing on to our destination.</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.nwf.org/backyard/" target="_blank">The National WildlifeFederation</a> (NWF) makes it easy for you to add a little (or alot) of nature to your surroundings. The five simple steps belowwill help you create beautiful outdoor spaces that you, your familyand various critters will enjoy. All you have to do is providesources of food, water and cover, then maintain those sources in anenvironmentally friendly manner.</p><br /><p><strong>1. Create Food Sources</strong>: Native plants andwildflowers are excellent natural sources of food for wildlife, andbecause they are well-accustomed to your area, they require lessintensive care. For a list of plants native to your state, alongwith undesirable invasives to avoid, click<a href="http://www.enature.com/native_invasive/" target="_blank">here</a>. Tolearn about attracting butterflies by incorporating their favoritevegetation into your garden, read'<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-and-Environment/2007-04-01/Monarch-Butterflies.aspx" target="_blank">Relief For Weary Monarch Butterflies</a>.'</p><br /><p><strong>2. Create Water Sources</strong>: Birdbaths areexcellent sources of clean water for urban wildlife, but if youhave a yard to work with, a great way to provide access to water isto create a small pond or water garden. It's easier than itsounds:</p><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Dig a hole 1 to 3 feet deep, preferably 3 feet if you want yourpond to be frog-friendly. Make sure the bottom is flat and level,or water may leak from one side. Make sure at least one edge issloped, so frogs can come and go as needed.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Add padding to the floor of the hole with sand or old carpet toprotect the liner.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Measure the hole and choose a liner made from EPDM (a syntheticrubber that withstands high and low temperatures); PVC willdeteriorate faster and contains harmful chemicals. The liner shouldbe big enough to extend at least 8 inches around the edge of thehole. Install the liner, then add rocks and dirt around the edge tosecure it.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Add water and plants. (If you fill the hole with tap water, letit sit for about a week to allow the chlorine to dissipate beforeadding plants or other waterlife.)</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p><strong>3. Provide Cover</strong>: Critters need places to hideand raise young?here's where logs, brush or rock piles come intoplay. Shrubs also are great cover sources, as are nesting boxes forsquirrels and birds. If you're considering a nesting box or two,keep in mind that bat houses are easy to make, and bats are greatat controlling insect populations, especially mosquitoes (to learnmore, read'<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-and-Environment/2005-10-01/Fantastic-Bats.aspx" target="_blank">Fantastic Bats</a>'). If you have a couple of dead trees on yourproperty, you already have a great shelter for creatures of allkinds.</p><br /><p><strong>4. Maintain</strong>: Now, all you have to do is keepyour new friends in mind when you are tending to your garden andyard. Garden the green way using mulch and compost, and avoidpesticides. Chances are your native plants won't need much help,anyway. Try reducing your lawn area, too, by expanding yourgardens. You'll save a lot of time and gas by mowing less, as wellas reduce the need for water and fertilizer. Another easy andeco-friendly gardening practice is to collect<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/2003-08-01/Harvest-the-Rain.aspx" target="_blank">rainwater</a> in buckets for irrigating. More green gardening tipscan be found in '<a href="http://www.nwf.org/gardenersguide/" target="_blank">TheGardener's Guide to Global Warming</a>,' a report from NWF thatoutlines the threats of climate change and what gardeners can do tohelp.</p><br /><p><strong>5. Certify</strong>: Not only will you enjoy newneighbors such as frogs, songbirds and butterflies, but you can goone step further and certify your new habitat with NWF.
