                    <h5 id="byline">      by ANNE AND PAUL EHRLICH    </h5>        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be, Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to the      words "population" "resources" and "environment" in the      late 1960's. (They also coined the term</em> coevolution,      <em>and did a lot to make</em> ecology <em>the household      word it is today.) But while most folks are aware of the      Ehrlichs' popular writing in the areas of ecology and      overpopulation (most of us for instance have read Paul's      book</em> The Population Bomb) . ~ . far <em>too few people      have any idea</em> of <em>how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (research of the type that      tends to be published only in technical journals and      college textbooks). That's why it pleases</em> us to <em>be      able</em> to <em>present-on a regular basis-the following      semi-technical column by authors/ecologists/educators Anne      and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <h3>      A RESOURCE DOWN THE RIVER    </h3>    <p>      In the midst of today's fuss and furor about our present      shortages <em>(and</em> continued depletion) of resources      -especially of energy-the accelerating loss of one of      our most precious treasures, our topsoil, has gone almost      unnoticed, Yet this neglected resource-which is today, and      has been in the past, the basis of much of America's      wealth-is so slowly renewable as to be virtually      irreplaceable.    </p>    <p>      Recent farming practices, abetted by federal and state farm      assistance that has actually <em>encouraged</em> increased      crop production at the expense of conservation measures,      are leading to unprecedented erosion-by wind and water-of      America's crop and grazing lands. The source of our future      productivity is being overused, abused, blown away, and      quite literally washed down the river.    </p>    <p>      How and why is this happening In a country where      sophisticated agricultural technology has been almost      universally adopted and where farmers have access to state      and federal assistance and extension services? Was nothing      learned as a result of the disastrous 1930's Dust Bowl?      Just how serious is the problem anyway?    </p>    <h3>      LESSONS LEARNED    </h3>    <p>      The Dust Bowl crisis did indeed stimulate an effective      national soil conservation program, Farmers were      taught-and encouraged through incentives-to employ      various techniques that diminish soil erosion and protect      fertility.    </p>    <p>      Among the methods were contour plowing, terracing, and      strip planting (the alternation of earth-retaining crops      with relatively erosive ones) ... all of which help protect      topsoil on sloping land from water erosion. Wind erosion      was reduced by planting windbreaks of trees or tall crops.    </p>    <p>      The depletion of soil nutrients, and <em>both</em> kinds of      erosion, were combated with crop rotation ... that is, the      planting of a cash crop (such as corn, soybeans, or wheat)      in alternate years with grasses or soil-enriching legumes      (alfalfa or clover, for example) that provide-in      addition-good pasturage for livestock.    </p>    <p>      Then, in the 1950's, grain production soared ... as a      result of the development of higher-yielding strains, the      increased use of fertilizers, and-in some areas-the      availability of improved water supply from irrigation      projects. Production soon far outstripped demand, and      prices began to fall.    </p>    <p>      To help stabilize farmers' incomes, the government      instituted a grain reserve program ... through which it      bought and held surpluses and actively promoted their sale      abroad. The "Soil Bank"-which paid farmers to keep a      portion of their land out of production-was also      initiated at that time. Sensible agriculturists, of course,      withheld their <em>least</em> productive fields, which were      most often those on hillsides or those with the thinnest,      poorest soil. Because this is the kind of land most      susceptible to erosion if plowed and planted, the Soil Bank      <em>did</em> effectively contribute to the nation's soil      conservation efforts.    </p>    <h3>      LESSONS FORGOTTEN    </h3>    <p>      However, everything changed In 1972, when-in the face of a      2% growth in the global population-there was a 4% worldwide      shortfall in the production of grain . . . the basis of the      diets of the majority of human beings. One of the worst-hit      nations was the Soviet Union, which quietly proceeded to      buy over 20 million tons of grain-mostly wheat-from      the United States.    </p>    <p>      Our country suddenly became very hard pressed to meet its      domestic demand and other foreign obligations. As a result,      grain prices went through the roof in 1973 ... and were      soon followed by substantial price rises for grain-fed meat      and poultry.    </p>    <p>      A second major drop in grain production in 1974 aggravated      the entire situation, nearly wiping out U.S. grain reserves      (which, for practical purposes, are the world's only      <em>real</em> food reserves) and bringing on severe famine      in several impoverished countries.    </p>    <p>      The U.S. government's response was to abolish the Soil      Bank. (The grain reserve program was already being      dismantled by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz and      friends, whose fondness for "free market" farm policies had      a lot to do with the disastrous fluctuation of farm incomes      in the 1970's.) Farmers were encouraged-by the Department      of Agriculture's (USDA) policies--to plant      fence-to-fence and boost production by every possible      means.    </p>    <p>      The higher production that resulted, however, was followed      by rock-bottom prices, which-together with increased      farming costs (mainly a result of increased consumption of      fuel and fertilizer) and higher loan interest      rates-reinforced the pressure to produce more. In      order to stay in business , many farmers had to coax every      possible kernel of grain out of the ground, so corn and      wheat growers responded to the economic squeeze by      abandoning or cutting back on soil conservation practices.      The costs of increased erosion would be paid decades in the      future ... while the profits gained from bigger harvests      were needed <em>immediately.</em>    </p>    <h3>      COURTING DISASTER    </h3>    <p>      In 1976 severe droughts reappeared in the western plains,      complete with dust storms. Some farmers, unable to make a      living, simply gave up and left their bare land to blow      away with the wind.    </p>    <p>      In the Corn Belt, still under the pressure to produce,      farmers increased corn and soybean acreage enormously by      putting land under <em>continuous</em> cropping. The loss      of nitrogen, formerly obtained by rotating cash crops with      leguminous pasturage, was compensated for by applying more      and more synthetic fertilizers. (Even though soybeans are      legumes and do add nitrogen to the earth, they tend to      contribute to erosion problems because their root systems      don't hold soil well.)    </p>    <p>      Some farmers gave up strip cropping and terracing on      slopes, partly to increase grain production (the alternate      crop used in the former techniques had often been less      remunerative than the in demand corn and wheat) and partly      because such procedures are incompatible with using the      latest oversized farm machinery. Worse still, some farmers      even completely abandoned the practice of contour plowing!    </p>    <p>      The most scandalous aspect of all, though, is that such      activities have been encouraged-and even financially      supported-by the USDA. In recent years, perhaps half of the      funds intended to support farmers' conservation practices      and paid out through the Agriculture Stabilization and      Conservation Service (ASCS) have, In reality, been spent on      such measures as improved irrigation and drainage systems      ... that do more to increase yields than they do to protect      soil.    </p>    <p>      In 1977, when the Carter administration instituted Its new      "set aside" program (the Soil Bank by another name), the      ASCS didn't allow pasture to be counted as cropland. So, in      order to establish their less-valuable land as "normal"      cropped acre age-and thereby qualify it for federal      subsidies-many farmers plowed and planted every      square Inch of their property in cash crops.    </p>    <p>      As a result of this lack of attention to conservation, the      USDA's Soil Conservation Service warned, in the mid-1970's,      that-through water erosion alone-the nation was      losing topsoil at an annual rate of three billion tons ...      as much as was being lost before the first national      conservation programs were established in the 1930's, and      twice the amount that should be allowed. The Council for      Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST), a private group      supported by several mid-western universities, estimated in      1975 that "one-third of All U.S. cropland was suffering      soil losses too great to be sustained without a gradual but      ultimately disastrous decline in productivity". And in late      1978, Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland dramatically      announced, "We are on a collision course with disaster. "    </p>    <h3>      HEAVY LOSSES    </h3>    <p>      The most recent-and the most exhaustive-study      of this problem is a comprehensive "Soil Erosion Inventory"      undertaken by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1977,      and released last spring. It showed that the nation      (excluding Alaska) lost some two billion tons of topsoil to      water erosion during 1977 and-in ten Great Plains states      alone-nearly 1.5 billion tons more to the wind.    </p>    <p>      Water erosion losses that year averaged four to five torts      per acre on cropland, pasture, and range land. Since only      the deepest soils can sustain losses at such rates, the      average is clearly far too high.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, the average figure tends to conceal the much      higher rates that prevail in some of our most fertile      states. Iowa, for instance, loses an estimated 9.9 tons per      acre ... Illinois, 6.7 ... Missouri, 10.4 . . . and      Louisiana, 7.9. (Worse yet, the soil in our Caribbean      possessions is being eroded at an average rate of over 40      tons per acre per year!)    </p>    <p>      Wind damage is a serious problem mainly in the relatively      dry Great Plains states and the cultivated parts of the and      West, which are-in turn-not terribly vulnerable      to water erosion. The average loss of cropland soil to wind      erosion, in the ten states surveyed by the SCS, was over      five tons per acre in 1977 ... but in three of those      states, losses exceeded eight tons per acre (in Texas, the      rate of erosion was nearly <em>three times</em> the      average).    </p>    <p>      The SCS concluded that well over <em>half</em> of the      nation's cropland needs conservation treatment ... as does      the great majority of our pasture, rangeland, and woodland.    </p>    <p>      Annual soil losses that can be "tolerated"-that is,      the rates at which they can be replenished by natural      processes and good husbandry-vary from one to five      tons per acre, depending on the depth and quality of the      topsoil. (Complete destruction of cropland is-for practical      purposes-irreversible. Although severe damage can, in      time, be repaired, it can be done only at very high expense      in comparison to the cost of conservation practices      designed to preserve and protect the soil in the first      place.)    </p>    <p>      With careful husbandry (which includes erosion protection      and the regular addition of crop residues and other organic      material), new soil <em>can</em> be built up ... at the      rate of about one inch per century. Nature, however, takes      several times longer.    </p>    <h3>      LOWER YIELDS    </h3>    <p>      So far, fortunately, no serious general decline in national      productivity has manifested itself as a result of the      recent trends toward "chemical" farming and the neglect of      conservation ... probably because soil losses can-for      a while-be masked by the application of more      fertilizers and other chemicals. But high erosion rates      clearly <em>cannot</em> be sustained for very long.    </p>    <p>      And even though overall U.S. cropland productivity hasn't      suffered a decline, neither has it grown significantly      since the early 1970's ... and it's quite possible that      declining soil fertility, due to over-intensive cropping      and erosion, is a factor in that lack of growth.    </p>    <p>      Soil erosion is a major contributor to national pollution      problems as well. In the past decade, our government has      made considerable progress in forcing industry to clean up      its act. The greatest cause of water pollution today is      runoff from what are called "non-point sources" ... that      is, mainly farms. Most of the two billion or more tons of      soil washed annually from U.S. croplands ends up in our      rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The silt fills up reservoirs      and clogs irrigation ditches, drainage systems, harbors,      and river channels.    </p>    <p>      And along with the billions of tons of soil go      <em>additional</em> millions of tons of fertilizers and      pesticides. In two-thirds of the river basins in the United      States, water quality is adversely affected by such      agricultural pollution.    </p>    <p>      Poorly managed farms also produce <em>air</em> pollution      ... in the form of dust particles blown from unprotected      dry land. The ultimate in this form of pollution Is the      dust storm, for which the 1930's were famous. Few Americans      outside of the plains states realize, however, that such      storms <em>recurred</em> in the 1950's and 1970's. (Each      generation of plains farmers apparently must learn the same      lesson all over again.)    </p>    <p>      In the United States, a return to sensible policies      encouraging soil conservation ironically may come about,      <em>not</em> because American agriculturists and the USDA      have suddenly become farsighted and concerned about future      productivity, but because federal clean water laws require      that streams and lakes be "fishable and swimmable" by 1983.      And the most effective way to control and prevent the water      pollution resulting from farm runoff is to employ      conventional soil protection practices. Of course, the      effects of such techniques can-and should-be      abetted by a curtailed use of farm chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Yet despite the mandate of our national cleanwater laws,      not much is being done. Farmers are still being encouraged      by USDA policies-and <em>forced</em> by economic      circumstances-to struggle for bigger harvests while      ignoring conservation practices and allowing their resource      base to be undermined and destroyed.    </p>    <p>      A Rural Clean Water Program was enacted by Congress in 1977      ... but fell victim, in 1978, to administration budget      cutting and bureaucratic wrangling over which agency should      run it. No funds were appropriated for the program during      that year.    </p>    <p>      That President Carter, who proudly calls himself a farmer,      should head an administration which has consistently      <em>slashed funding</em> for soil conservation programs is      both astonishing and disgraceful. Such "cost cutting"      strikes us as the falsest of economies in a hungry world in      which the population is expected to increase by nearly two      billion by the end of the century.    </p>    <p>      A sizable-and growing-number of the earth's people are      dependent on U.S. food exports. The U.S., in turn, depends      on the $25 billion or more that such food exports earn each      year to help meet Its oil import bill.    </p>    <p>      It remains to be seen how much-if any-of the damage that      has already been done to United States farmland can be      reversed. At the very least, we as a nation must do our      utmost to prevent any further destruction of our      irreplaceable soil resources.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sources for this study included James Risser's "Soil      Erosion Creates a Crisis Down on the Farm" a series of      articles published in the De; Moines</em> Register in      <em>September 1978 and reprinted in the</em> Conservation      Foundation Letter, <em>December 1978</em> ... <em>the Soil      Conservation Service's</em> 1977 National Resource      Inventories (U.
