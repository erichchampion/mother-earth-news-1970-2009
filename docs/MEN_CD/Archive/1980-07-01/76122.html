                    <p>      This past summer-while on vacation in upper Michigan-I made      a lifesaving swap. My 1988 Volkswagen bus had chugged its      way up one last hill and sputtered to a halt . . and-upon      close inspection-I saw that nothing short of a rebuilt      engine would get the old clunker rolling again.    </p>    <p>      I had no choice but to leave the brokendown vehicle where      it had collapsed and hitch a ride to the nearest village.      Inquiring at the first open gas station, I was directed      three blocks down the street . . . to the only VW mechanic      in town.    </p>    <p>      Few folks would smile in such dire circumstances . . . but      as I traipsed toward the shop, my grin became wider than      the wing span of an Andean Condor. I'm a professional      housepainter, you see, and I observed that the man's      dwelling was badly in need of a fresh overcoat. (In fact,      someone was beginning to scrape off the last fragments of      chipped paint before my very eyes!)    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, it was too good a trade for either the      auto dot or me to pass up. We swapped our skills . . . and      my disabled bus received a well-deserved rebuilding . . .      while the mechanic's abode was dressed up in a new      overcoat.    </p>    <p>      Since then, I've bartered any number of times, but no other      exchange has been quite as opportune as that trade for a      reinvigorated VW!    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>E.E.<br />      <br />      Illinois</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Now that autumn is only a month or so away, and the freezer      and canning jars are-once againgetting stocked with a      summer harvest of homegrown vegetables, I'm reminded of the      swap that started my family's gardening venture.    </p>    <p>      Four years ago, we moved to a tiny village in the Upper      Peninsula of Michigan and began renovating an 80-year-old      house. Although we treasured our newfound home, we were      sorry that the Victorian dwelling-which is located near the      center of town-had only a postage stamp of a back yard,      just barely large enough to contain a sandbox, clothesline,      workshop, and woodpile . . . much less the expansive garden      our green thumbs ached for!    </p>    <p>      This past spring I was grumbling to my neighbor-she's a      widow who's nearing her eightieth birthday-that I had space      for only the smallest suggestion of a garden. My friend, in      turn, bemoaned the fact that she could no longer do the      digging, hoeing, and weeding required to grow the fresh      produce which had always adorned her dinner table in the      past.    </p>    <p>      We looked at each other . . . and the idea took root, so to      speak. Within a week she and I had tilled the soil and      planted our mutual garden! Then, throughout the hot summer      months, my many-seasoned friend provided the water,      compost, and land . . . while I furnished the muscle and      seeds. Now we're both munching on the harvest . . . and      making plans for an even bigger garden next spring.    </p>    <p>      And, of course, there's an added benefit to be had from      bartering: We both reap that best of all harvests . . .      friendship!    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>A.S.<br />      <br />      Michigan</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      I've worked out a swap that not only agrees with my      pocketbook . . . but appeals to my palate as well!    </p>    <p>      A bachelor friend-who's pursuing a selfsufficient existence      in the hills of southeastern Oregon-has a specialty:      cheesemaking. However, his homemade Cheddar is no ordinary      deli product . . . it's apple-woodsmoked ambrosia that is      irresistible to moat folks. (And that tact makes it good      tradin' material!)    </p>    <p>      My tastebuds being somewhat partial to the mouthwatering      cheese, I order -twice each yearabout 50 of the      lemon-colored half-pound packages from my backwoods buddy.      Then, whenever I embark on a coastal trip, I pack an ample      supply of the homemade delicacy along, too. While on the      road, I'll often slice a thin tidbit off one of the creamy      blocks and offer it to the gas station attendant or motel      owner with whom I'm dealing. Invariably, I find myself with      free fuel or lodging . . . in exchange for a generous      portion of my "stash".    </p>    <p>      In fact, I'm able to purchase just about everything I need      while traveling with this "yellow gold". Once, for      instance, when I was fishing off a Pacific rock, I watched      an old codger nearby bag one bonito after another . . .      while my line didn't get so much as a nibble. Baiting my      fisherfriend--instead of the hookwith a sample of cheese .      . . I offered a package for a lesson. Soon I had a pile of      the swift, finned swimmers myself!    </p>    <p>      And what do I trade with my bachelor friend to get the      cheese in the first place:' Well, occasionally the woodsman      hankers for a little civilization, along with some needed      big city (Portland) supplies. To his side of the bargain is      free food and lodging at my urban dwellinganytime-for as      long as he needs to stay.    </p>    <p>      Usually after five days or so, my pal -having regaled me      with tales of a far different lifestylehappily heads back      home. By bartering, we both get the best of country life      and city slackin'!    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>R.L.F.<br />      <br />      Oregon</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Barter has always been a part of our livestrading a CB      radio for auto repairs . . . painting and papering skills      for lowered rents . . . and so forth-but, for the longest      time, I hesitated to approach "professionals" with a swap      proposition. Then, when I found out that I was pregnant      with our first child (and knew that our limited funds      wouldn't meet the expense), I plunged in and took a chance.    </p>    <p>      Being a sculptor by trade, I hesitantly approached our      physician with the offer of a commissioned piece of artwork      in return for medical services. It was wellknown that the      dot's ancestors hailed from the green isle of the      leprechaun, so I suggested a cast of an Irish farmer      leaning against a stone fence. Well, to my surprise (and      delight!) the doctor enthusiastically agreed to the idea.      As a result of the bargain, we "paid off"-for a mere $75      worth of materials and foundry work-over $400 in medical      bills . . . which not only took care of our daughter's      delivery, but all her immunizations as well!    </p>    <p>      Since that time I've traded my art for other health      services and legal fees, too. In fact, at the moment, I'm      shopping around for a dentist with a yen for sculpture and      a bent for barter. (After all, professionals are "just      folks", too! )    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>L.S.<br />      <br />      California</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Four years ago, while preparing to make our move to the      country, my husband and I held a giant garage sale to      dispose of all the city trappings we'd accumulated.      Although I was more than happy to place most of the old      belongings in new hands, I hated to see my sewing machine      go. However, electrical appliances would have no place in      our simpler lifestyle . . . so I made no objection when my      spouse swapped the stitcher for a trailer (which we      desperately needed to transport the tools and equipment      we'd gathered for our homestead start).    </p>    <p>      When we reached our land, the versatile hauler served us as      a storage shed while we built our house. Then-in the      autumn-it became a first-rate firewood carrier. The next      summer I again transformed the mobile shelter (with the      help of a few 2 X 4's and some plastic covering) ... this      time into a temporary greenhouse. But by year's end my      ideas for using the trailer were exhausted.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, after watching the paper for notices of moving      sales, I located a family in need of just such a vehicle.      Rather than asking for cash, I suggested that I go to their      sale . . . and possibly we could work out a swap. One look      around and the deal was clinched: I drove away with a      beaming smile, a treadle sewing machine . . . and a firm      belief in barter!    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>M.D.<br />      <br />      Ontario.
