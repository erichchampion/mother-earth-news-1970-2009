                    <h5 id="byline">     by CYNTHIA B. CRISCOLL    </h5>    <p>      <strong>A little careful planning and a little succession      planting during the midsummer dog days can help you get      almost double the usual production from your garden. So why      not sit right down, dig out those seed catalogs, and get      ready to . . .</strong>    </p>        <p>      If you're like most gardeners, you probably plant a few      late crops each summer (more as an afterthought than      anything else), but perhaps you've never seriously      considered coaxing a full <em>second harvest</em> from your      vegetable plot. I know I never gave the possibility much      thought . . . until one autumn morning when my shovel hit a      12-inch-long white radish (of the oriental Dalkon variety)      buried deep in the still warm earth. That delectable      vegetable inspired me to systematically plan and cultivate      a late harvest in my backyard plot.    </p>    <p>      Since the "day of the Dalkon", I've learned (mostly by      trial and error) how to nearly <em>double</em> my annual      harvesteven here in Minnesota, where the growing season is      quite short by starting a second crop during the hot      weather months. And you can enjoy the same success . . .      with just a little planning and careful attention to the      details that make late summer and fall planting different      from spring sowing.    </p>    <h3>      THE DRAWING BOARD    </h3>    <p>      Any venture into three season gardening should begin with      thorough planning . . . including seed selection and a      "blueprint" plan to fit your particular growing season. If      you're not sure of the dates of the last killing spring      frost and the first autumn freeze in your area, the county      agricultural extension agent can provide you with the      information.    </p>        <p>      You might be surprised to find that the length of your own      property's frost-free growing season is different from that      of even your closest neighbor's land. . . because of      variations in the terrain. As you know, warm air rises . .      . so a hilltop garden is encouraged to produce abundant      harvests both early and late in the season. On the other      hand, the cooler air in valleys (especially those with      spring fed streams) may surround a lowland garden with a      cold and clammy atmosphere that's not conducive to either      early <em>or</em> late cropping.    </p>    <p>      Although it's hardly practical to move your family to an      area with a longer growing season just to be able to try      succession planting, you <em>can</em> make some onsite      adjustments that will help you grow late crops      successfully. First of all, be sure to locate your garden      where it won't be shaded by tall trees . . . which rob the      young plants of sunlight and soil nutrients. It's also a      good idea to place your vegetable plots on the south and      east sides of buildings . . . or to protect the crops from      punishing north winds by putting in shrubs (or another type      of low windbreak) along the garden's vulnerable edge. You      might also. want to plant your early and late crops toward      the <em>top</em> of a slope, or in raised beds.    </p>    <h3>      DO YOUR HOMEWORK    </h3>    <p>      Once you know the limits of your frostfree season and have      chosen a site for your garden that will make the best use      of that time periodyou're ready to pore over the seed      catalogs. You will, of course, need frost tolerant      vegetables in order to extend your garden's productive life      into the autumn. Hints in catalog descriptionssuch as "sown      in early August for fall crops" . . . "will increase in      eating quality into late fall" . . . and "best in September      when nights are cooler" will help direct you to the proper      selections.    </p>        <p>      You should choose only the hardiest cultivars ( those that      can survive a minimum temperature of 26°F) <em>and</em>      those that mature quickly . . . especially if you live in      the upper part of North America. A short season cabbage,      for example, might have a better chance of coming to      harvest than would a slower growing "main crop" cabbage.    </p>    <p>      You'll find all kinds of robust vegetables in the catalogs      of seed companies catering to a northern U.S. or Canadian      clientele . . . since such firms often specialize in short      season crops that are ideal for succession planting. Here      are some reliable companies to try: Stokes Seeds, Inc.,      Dept. TMEN, Box 548, Buffalo, New York 14240 . . . Farmer      Seed and Nursery, Dept. TMEN, 818 Northwest 4th Street,      Faribault, Minnesota 55021 . . . and Johnny's Selected      Seeds, Dept. TMEN, Albion, Maine 04910. (The last one is an      especially good source of late producers. The firm's fine      catalog features such prime midseason and fall crops as      Lutz Green Leaf beets, Scarlet Keeper carrots, Wando peas,      and Danish Ballhead cabbage.)    </p>    <p>      Once you've narrowed down your preferences to a few      specific varieties, it will be helpful to draw up a      Succession Planting Sow-Harvest chart (like the sample      accompanying this article). On paper, you can easily      shuffle and rearrange the garden rows like puzzle pieces .      . . as long as you keep in mind the approximate sowing and      reaping dates for each crop. For instance, you might like      to try an early lettuce, succeeded by midseason carrots (      as in Row 2 ) . . . or follow an early cabbage with a late      beet (Row 7). Most horticultural experts recommend planting      a root crop after a leafy vegetable, in order to balance      the supplies of the different nutrients that each type of      plant removes from the soil.    </p>        <p>      Although the chart shown here was formulated for the cold      climate of Zones 3 and 4, it can be modified to fit the      growing season in warmer locales by simply adding time to      either end. (A Plant Hardiness Zone Map can be ordered-for      $1.00-from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government      Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402 . . . ask for USDA      Miscellaneous Publication No. 814. ) You may have to adjust      your master plan to adapt to an unusually late spring or an      unexpected cool spell, as well. (I always allow an extra      week for each crop, anyway. . . to accommodate any      unforeseen weather changes.)    </p>    <p>      When you formulate your succession planting schedule,      remember to take advantage of some of the newly developed      hybrid cultivars, many of which mature in significantly      shorter growing periods than do older types. The 1979 All      America Grand Duke hybrid kohlrabi, for example, will      mature five days sooner than would previous varieties of      the vegetable . . . and five days can be quite significant      for gardeners in cooler climates!    </p>    <h3>      SEEDING AND TRANSPLANTING    </h3>    <p>      No matter what zone you live in, you'll find that planting      a fall garden is quite different from spring sowing . . .      since the late year cropper has to deal with less than      favorable conditions. The soil at midseason is warm and dry      (and already depleted of many nutrients by the earlier      crops), and transplants aren't readily available from local      nurseries once summer is well established.    </p>    <p>      Most of my early attempts at planting for autumn harvest      ended in failure . . . simply beause I didn't know that      seeds have maximum as well as minimumgermination      temperatures. The optimum soil temperatures for sprouting      many cool season vegetables are well below 80°F. (For      example, endive, lettuce, and spinach germinate spottily if      at all in soil that's warmer than 75°F. )    </p>    <p>      To deal with this problem, use a soil thermometer (as I do)      to determine when your garden's ground is registering above      the maximum germination temperature for a particular seed.      If the soil gets <em>too</em> warm, you can temper the      planting environment by covering newly seeded rows with a      board or straw bale (as insulation against the summer sun),      by planting in the shade of a tall crop (such as pole beans      or sweet corn), or simply by sowing presprouted seeds (you      can germinate them yourself in a sprouting jar placed in a      cool cupboard).    </p>    <p>      If your fall garden plan requires that you set out      plants-in order to harvest a mature crop before midwinter      you may be able to find the "starts" you need at a local      nursery . . . however, many garden centers overlook the      needs of autumn agriculturists, so you'll probably have to      place a special order earlier in the season. Should you      decide to grow your own second crop transplants, on the      other hand, a cool basement equipped with a grow light will      serve as an ideal environment for nurturing young      seedlings.    </p>    <p>      A botanist once showed me how to stretch my garden's      production of tomatoes long past the normal season by      propagating midsummer suckers. To do this, I simply soak      the trimmed young tomato shoots in a bucketful of warm      water for four to six hours before planting them. Such July      transplants will produce large, healthy vegetables long      after the regular vines of summer have been exhausted.    </p>    <h3>      CULTIVATION    </h3>    <p>      With April showers only a distant memory, you'll probably      have to spend a lot of hours watering your late summer      plot. However-if you don't want to become a slave to the      August seedlings use mulch or a covering of straw to help      retain soil moisture. (I use a mulch mixture made of one      part soil and one part compost.    </p>    <p>      You'll also need to <em>fertilize</em> your mid season      crops generously, since they be gin their garden lives in      soil whose nutrients have been depleted by the previous      crops. But transplants will respond wit lush growth if      they're initially watered with a highphosphorus rooting      solution and then sidedressed with a balance fertilizer (I      just use whatever manure i handy). Always make sure you      side dress away from exposed plant parts, though . . . to      avoid fertilizer burn.    </p>    <p>      It's a good idea as I mentioned before to rotate leafy and      root crops, in order to balance the food supply in the      soil. I also like to plant some kind of peas or beans at      regular intervals in each row since legumes collect      nitrogen from the air and transfer it to the soil.    </p>    <h3>      GETTING READY FOR SPRING    </h3>    <p>      Even your lush, extended fall harvest has to end, however .      . . and finally the hard frosts of early winter will take      their toll. That's your signal to "close u shop" and      prepare your garden for spring planting. I usually convert      all of the healthy plant residue to compost . . . an then I      till pony and chicken manure into the plot to replenish the      soil. (The late plowing is also good for turning up pest      eggs and larvae . . . and exposing they to winter's killing      temperatures.)    </p>    <p>      I work several rows smooth, in order t have them ready for      planting early or ions, peas, spinach, and radishes.      However, several late fall crops-such a sprouts, carrots,      beets, and kale-ofte survive until Thanksgiving ( even up      her in Minnesota!), so <em>their</em> furrows have t wait      until spring for soil preparation.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, a midsummer sowing of seeds and transplants      will-with careful planning and culture mature into      delicious vegetables for late season eating. When the new      seed catalogs begin to arrive in December, I'm usually just      harvesting the final produce from m midseason garden . . .      and it's ahead time to start planning spring crops! It      seems as though the work/fun never ends . . . but that's      just a happy fact of life for three season gardeners!    </p>		<p>PHOTOS BY THE AUTHOR</p>
