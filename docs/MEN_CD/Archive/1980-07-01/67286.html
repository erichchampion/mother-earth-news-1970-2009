                    <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S own livestock expert--Randy Kidd-- shares      basics of "hatching" your own swine.</strong>    </p>    <p>      In last issue's article ("How to Raise Healthy Pigs",      MOTHER NO. 63, page 88) I tried to pass along all the know      how necessary to rear eating size porkers from weaned      feeder pigs. Of course, a number of folks will want to set      up a year round breeding operation. If you're thinking of      going "whole hog" with your own swine raising efforts,      however, you should know right off the bat that rearing      newborn piglets is a somewhat involved and risky      undertaking. In fact, from 30 to 40% of the baby swine born      in the hog-breeding business in this country die shortly      after birth!    </p>    <p>      But a small scale homesteader is able to provide more      conscientious caretaking than can most large enterprises,      so you should be able to save almost all your curly-tailed      youngsters ... and successfully raise an average of 16 hogs      per sow (from two litters) each year. All it takes to      achieve the goal is a lot of tender loving care and some      solid know how.    </p>    <h3>      MATING THE SOW    </h3>    <p>      Obviously enough, the first step toward rearing healthy      piglets is making sure the intended mother is mated! A gilt      (a young female hog) should reach sexual maturity at five      or six months of age, and be receptive for two or three      days of each subsequent 21 day cycle. You can be sure that      a sow's in estrus (heat) if the female has a swollen vulva.      She also may or may not have a slight mucuslike or bloody      vaginal discharge . . . act restless . . . urinate      frequently . . . twitch her tail . . . hold her ground when      you press down on her hindquarters . . . or try to "ride"      other sows.    </p>    <p>      You should mate gills on their first day of heat and older      "gals" on the second day. (Both young and old sows should      receive a second mating 24 hours after their first.) As for      the male partners in a porcine union, an 8- to 12-month-old      boar can usually service 12 females in pasture or be      "handmated" (matched individually in a barn) with 24 gills      or sows. A yearling (or older) boar can service 50 sows in      stalls or 35 to 40 pasturing females.    </p>                <h3>      PREPARING FORTH E BIG DAY    </h3>    <p>      The gestation period for your pregnant sow will be      approximately. 113 days, or as the old saying goes three      months, three weeks, and three days. But there are some      important preparations to be made before that magic moment      of birth arrives.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, you should in advance take steps to help      keep diseases from striking those fragile newborns. So be      sure to worm (for parasites) and spray (for lice) each sow      about two weeks before her due date. You should also      immunize an expectant mother against erysipelas . . . to      strengthen both the sow's and offspring's resistance to      this most common-and usually fatal swine disease. Likewise,      good sanitation is a vital part of preventive health care,      so thoroughly clean the farrowing pen (and keep it clean) .      . . and wash the pregnant porker with a mild detergent and      warm water before you pen her up for delivery.    </p>    <h3>      THE FARROWING PEN    </h3>    <p>      Another important prefarrowing job is m building a proper      "birthing nest". Little "piglets 'need a very warm      environment. The baby porkers will thrive at 80 to      90°F... suffer at 60 to 70°F... and die it when the      mercury dips to around 50°. The youngsters' mother, on      the other hand, probably has three to five solid inches of      insulation (better known as lard) around her middle ... so      she's more likely to suffer from overheating!    </p>    <p>      The different temperature needs of a swine mother and her      children can create quite a problem. While the little      oinkers will try to cuddle up against Mom to stay warm, the      parent pig will just as likely be trying to cool off by      continually standing up and sitting down. And every time      the mother settles back down, she runs the risk of landing      on and perhaps killing a baby squealer.    </p>    <p>      To avoid such a calamity, your farrowing pen should      incorporate a separate heat source for the piglets ... so      they won't need to scramble up to their mother for warmth.      Most folks use electric or gaspowered heat lamps for this      purpose, although a few innovative individuals have taken      to building solar heated farrowing pens. (EDITOR'S NOTE:      For more information on such developments, see Jim Murphy's      "Warm Your Swine With Sunshine" (MOTHER NO. 57, page 34)      and "Update: The Solar Pig Farrowing House" (No. 58, page      75).    </p>    <p>      Your pen should also have some piglet "guard rails" that      stand 8 to 10 inches off the floor and extend 1 to 12      inches out from the farrowing pert walls. By crawling under      the rails, the little ones can curl up and sleep safely in      their own heated spot, and scramble out after Mother only      at mealtime.    </p>    <h3>      THE FARROWING    </h3>    <p>      A few days before the piglets are due, you'll want to move      the expectant sow into her new quarters so she can adjust      to the changed surroundings. (Be sure, though, to let her      out for two 10 to 15 minute periods of exercise every day      that she's in the farrowing pen . . . to help the beast      ward off constipation and nervous stress.)    </p>    <p>      Around that same time, you'll need to gather together all      your nursery items (such as iodine, clean rags, and plenty      of bedding). And don't forget to keep a pitchfork or shovel      around as well, so you can keep the farrowing area "clean      enough to sit in with your Sunday best duds on".    </p>    <p>      You'll know that the sow is ready to bear her young when      she gets restless and tries to make a nest in her farrowing      pen. Once the mother actually starts giving birth, you can      help events proceed smoothly by talking to the sow      reassuringly or if you feel foolish conversing with a      pig-by giving her a small portion of laxative bran meal.      Then, as each baby is born, dry the new arrival with clean      rags (before it hits the ground, if possible). Also, paint      the piglets' navels with iodine by either spraying the      disinfectant on each youngster's severed cord or by firmly      placing the tot over a wide-mouthed bottle of iodine so      that its navel cord hangs down into the container and then      deftly turning both bottle and pig upside down.    </p>    <p>      It's probably best to keep the newborn piglets in a heated      corner (or box), away from their mother . . . while she      undergoes her birthing there. Then, once they're all born      and you've disposed of the after birth, make sure each      newcomer leas the ,.nonce to nurse and obtain some of its      mother's precious colostrum. This "first milk" is high in      nutrients, vitamins, min erals, and antibodies. (You might      even milk some extra colostrum from the sow to store in ice      cube trays . . . in case you later encounter a mother who      won't allow her piglets to nurse.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, after you've gone on to clean out the soiled      bedding and made sure that both the new mother and her      piglets are comfortable . . . you can go back to bed and      try to make yourself comfortable. Don't expect to get much      sleep, though ... because farrowing inevitably finishes      just in time for you to begin your morning chores!    </p>    <h3>      INFANT CARE    </h3>    <p>      A sow's milk is naturally deficient in iron, so one of your      first piglet caretaking tasks will be "recharging" the      newborns supply of that mineral. If your youngsters are      starting out life on a dirt floored pen (or if you provide      a boxed supply of soil in the nursery), the little ones may      get all the iron they need by rooting in the earth. But if,      like most folks, you choose to raise the piglets in a more      sanitary environment. You'll need to give your one to three      day old critters either an injection of 150 to 200      milligrams of iron, or a feed that contains about 36      milligrams of iron per pound.    </p>    <p>      The youngsters' main diet from birth until they're weaned      at four to eight weeks of age will, of course, be their      mother's milk. But you should also provide your growing      oinkers in the first week with an at hand supply of high      quality feed (use a creep feeder so that the sow can't get      at the goodies) containing at least 18% protein ... and all      the essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.    </p>    <p>      Most pig raisers will want to remove the tips of their      piglets' eight needle teeth on the same day the      "swinelings" receive the iron supplements. Simply nip off      the tips of the teeth with wire cutters or with special      tooth clippers designed for the purpose . . . otherwise,      the little pigs can use their tusklike biters to hurt other      youngsters or accidentally harm their momma's udders.    </p>    <p>      Any males that are not going to be raised for breeding      stock should also be castrated while young .. . to prevent      uncontrolled mating and to keep their meat from developing      an "off", or "boarish", flavor and odor. If you perform      this operation when the piglets are around two weeks of      age, your task will be relatively easy and nontraumatic for      the young animal.    </p>    <p>      To castrate a shoat, have a helper hold the piglet up by      its hind legs while you wash the animal's genital area with      a disinfectant. Then use a sterilized knife (either a      hooked blade castrating tool or a regular scalpel that's      been outfitted with a No. 12 blade) to make a long, deep      incision over the length of each testicular bulge.    </p>    <p>      Many novice castrators will make this cut too short or      shallow. Such a failing will not only make testicle removal      more difficult, but also-by not providing adequate drainage      for the wound cause much more swelling (and pain) for the      pig, and increase the likelihood of infection.    </p>    <p>      So don't be shy when you wield the knife! If you make the      incision correctly, the testicles will either fall out of      the scrotum or be easy to press out by hand. Then simply      grab each "mountain oyster" and pull it gently away from      the pig until the connecting artery and cord stretch and      break off. The subsequent snapback will force the artery to      contract and quickly choke off the flow of blood. (Cuffing      the vessel, on the other hand, can cause a lot of      bleeding.)    </p>    <p>      After you've performed the simple cut and pull procedure,      spray or powder the exposed area with an antibiotic, and if      the operation takes place during fly season apply a      protective dressing. Then let the newly castrated male (now      known as a barrow) loose in a cleanly bedded pen. In a few      days the cut will heal, and the little fellow should be as      good, well almost as good as new. (And by the way, the      leftovers from your work make delicious beer chasers when      washed and fried in an egg batter.)    </p>    <h3>      THE JOY OF PIG BREEDING    </h3>    <p>      Raising pigs "from scratch" definitely takes more      commitment, work, and know how than simply fattening up      some purchased weavers. Along with careful handling of the      mating, the farrowing, and the infants' upbringing, you'll      need to keep complete records on each sow's productivity      (including the weights of her litters when weaned) . . . so      you can cull the poor producers from your herd and promote      overall breeding efficiency. (Of course, you should also      keep track of vaccination and worming dates and all other      medications used.)    </p>    <p>      All in all, though, breeding your own pigs can take you one      step closer to true self-sufficiency ... provide you with      the opportunity to start a worthwhile homestead      critter-raising business ... and give you a heck of a lot      of satisfaction.    </p>    <h3>      MORE PIG RAISING HOW-TO    </h3>    <p>      Additional information on breeding pigs can be found in Pat      Imig's excellent seven page article, "Homestead Hog      Management: A to Z" (MOTHER NO. 40, page 52), and in her      followup pieces, "Plan Now to Prevent Pig Losses at      Farrowing Time" (issue 43, page 26), "It's Spring Farrowing      Time" (issue 44, page 28), "Baby Pig Manage. ment Made      Easy" (issue 45, page 30), and "How to Select Good Breeding      Stock" (issue 46, page 30). Back issues are available for      $3.00 each from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.    </p>    <p>      Two fine books on swine rearing are Dirk van Loon's      263-page paperback, Small-Scale Pig Raising ($5.95, Garden      Way) and Jerome D.
