        <p>Lately, more and more people have begun to understand just how limited in both variety and nutritional value our "modern" diets have become. This realization has sparked a new and widespread interest in the culinary and therapeutic uses of herbs . . . chose plants which although not well Snown today were, just one short generation a go, honored "guests" on the dinner tables and in the medicine chests of our grandparents' homes. In this regular feature, MOTHER examines the availability, cultivation, and benefits of our "forgotten" vegetable foods and rem edies . . . and we hope, helps pre vent the loss of still another bit of an cestral lore.</p><p>If there's a single, pervasive reason why you should make lavender a part of your landscape, it is of course the plant's famous fragrance.</p><p>This ancient and aromatic herb once adorned the sacrificial altars of early Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. (Virgil praised the honey of bees that fed on its sweetness . . . and the Romans were so fond of using its flowers in their perfumes, soaps, and baths that the name lavender was derived from the Latin verb lavare, meaning "to wash".)</p><p>Years later, France's Charles VI reclined on lavender filled satin cushions . . . Queen Elizabeth I was particularly fond of "lavender conserves" . . . and in 1895 it was reported that Queen Victoria's royal residences "are thoroughly impregnated with the refreshing odour of this old fashioned flower, and there is no perfume that the Queen likes better".</p><h3>A WIDE SELECTION</h3><p>There are 28 different species of lavender, and many separate varieties among these. The hardiest and sweetest smelling type is Lav andula vera, better known as "English" or "true" lavender. Also very popular is <em>Lavandula s</em> pica, or "spike" lavender . . . a plant which has broader leaves that contain more oil than do those of L. vera, although its flowers are somewhat less fragrant. (Both varieties are frequently grouped under the more general name of Lavandula officinalis.)</p><p>Though you can grow this herb from seed, its slow germination and low survival rate will try the patience of average gardeners, so it's generally best to start with nursery plants or to take cuttings from a friend's garden.</p><p>Some good mail order sources for plants are: Sandy Mush Herb Nursery, Dept. TMEN, Route 2, Surrett Cove Road, Leicester, North Carolina 28748 (catalog $1.00, refundable) ... Sunnybrook Farms Nursery, Dept. TMEN, 9448 Mayfield Road, Chesterland, Ohio 44026 (catalog $1.00, refundable) . . . and Hemlock Hill Herb Farm, Dept. TMEN, Hemlock Hill Road, Litchfleld, Connecticut 06759 (catalog 50d).</p><p>When planting stem cuttings, use pieces no longer than three inches . . . with at least two nodes included on each little limb. Root them in sand, cinders, vermiculite, or sphagnum . . . and keep them partly shaded, moderately moist, and protected from drafts.</p><p>Root cuttings should be made in the fall or winter, and cool stored in pots of sandy loam before spacing them two to three feet apart outdoors in the spring (after danger of frost).</p><p>When making plant divisions, simply dig up three-year-old plants and tear each root cluster in two. (Lavender gets too woody if left undivided for much longer than three seasons.)</p><h3>AN IDEAL BORDER</h3><p>Though the sweet scented plant is an ideal little shrub to border walkways and flowerbeds, make sure the location has well drained, limed, sandy (or even rocky) soil . . . along with plenty of sun, plus wind protection. In areas where temperatures drop below zero, you should probably bring your lavender plants indoors for the winter. In any case, it's best to prune the herbs back after they bloom.</p><p>The flowers, which make their appearance in July and August, should be picked just before the buds open. Dry them, if possible, in the shade at 90 to 100Â°F. Then strip the flowers from the stems and store the blooms in airtight containers for use in sachets, potpourri, herbal baths, herb jellies, etc. (In olden days, lavender petals were strewn on church and castle floors to sweeten the air, and much the same effect can be created today by sprinkling the flowers over carpets before you vacuum them.)</p>
