                <p>      Report From Them That's Doin'    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Jerry Westmoreland    </h5>    <p>      It's been three years since my wife Carolyn and I decided      to start taking steps that would-we hoped and      <em>still</em> hope-take us away from our urban life      and nine-to-five jobs to, eventually, a self-sufficient      farmstead.    </p>    <p>      Well, we haven't completed that journey yet. We're moving      in the right direction, though . . . and <em>learning</em>      as <em>we</em> go. We finally have our own house, for one      thing. The dwelling is kind of old-and not very      large-but it suits us just fine.    </p>    <p>      The second big step in our move toward self-reliance was      taken when I quit my computer programming job (the results      of <em>that</em> decision have been little short of amazing      . . . I don't even <em>shake</em> anymore!) and settled      down-with my wife's help -to the task of making      our part-time ceramics enterprise into a full-fledged home      business!    </p>    <p>      As you can imagine, we don't pull down any big bucks      selling our handicrafts. Our house payments are small,      however .. . we raise much of our own food, although we      have only about 1/3 acre ... and we still live close enough      to town (Porterville, California) to <em>walk</em> to the      store when we have to.    </p>    <h3>      A BACKYARD BARNYARD    </h3>    <p>      One of the ways we've kept our food costs down-and      even brought in a little spending money on the      side-has been by keeping animals. We have two nanny      goats (one of which is a registered Nubian, but she's      managed to produce only one doe-and <em>four</em>      bucks-in two breeding seasons) which supply us with a      good bit of milk.    </p>    <p>      We also raised two pigs last year. The little critters cost      us $15 apiece in the spring and-after a summer of      fattening them up-we were able to sell one for $92.25      and have the other butchered for our freezer. (We had a      delicious 14-pound home-smoked ham for Thanksgiving dinner,      and haven't had to buy any bacon or sausage for quite some      time now!)    </p>    <p>      We keep chickens and ducks, too. But the pride and joy of      our backyard livestock operation just <em>has</em> to be      our steer! We bought the critter-as a      newborn-from dairy for $20. He promptly developed a      horrible case of scours and almost died. I managed to      convince myself (partly as a result of MOTHER's      encouragement, I'm sure) that a bit of basic veterinary      care wasn't beyond my capabilities ... and sure enough,      after I'd gritted my teeth and given him some medicine and      an injection or two, the youngster recovered. Now he weighs      upward of 600 pounds . . . and we plan to have him      butchered (I'm not sure I'm up to tackling <em>that</em>      chore yet) this coming February.    </p>		    <h3>      LEARNING BY DOING    </h3>    <p>      Although we've been pretty fortunate with our animals, last      year's garden (our first real attempt at one of      family-food-production dimensions) wasn't a great success.      I was just learning the fine art of composting at the time,      and didn't use enough manure (which, since we didn't have      all our animals yet, would have cost precious cash to      obtain).    </p>    <p>      <em>This</em> year, however, things are looking much      better. I've been turning out about a half-ton of      absolutely <em>beautiful</em> compost (forgive my      enthusiasm) every month for some time. To begin "fertilizer      production", my son Hans and I built a threesided bin near      the back fence (midway between the goat and pig pens). I      store my heap of already shredded organic matter-my      "pre-compost" pile-immediately in front of the      enclosure, and my "pre-precompost" pile (of manure,      bedding, waste hay, and leaves that need to be shredded) in      front of <em>that.</em>    </p>    <p>      Every day I haul a wheelbarrow load of manure and spoiled      hay from the steer's area and dump it . . . along with the      gleanings every two or three days from the goat pen. Then,      once a month, my son shreds the "pre-pre-pile" into the      "pre-pile" ... using our rotary lawn mower. I simply fork      the well-chopped matter-along with some      soil-into the bin, wetting it as I go, and turn the      heaps once every three or four days for two weeks.    </p>    <p>      That's all there is to it, and the result is the      richest-looking, cleanest <em>-smelling soil</em> builder      you could ever imagine. If it gives our crops the boost      that we (relying on MOTHER's advice and the evidence      provided by "early returns" from our planting beds) believe      it will, this year's garden should be one of the lushest in      the entire county!    </p>    <p>      Of course, compost alone won't make crops grow. And we've      learned another trick or two since our first horticultural      attempt. Probably the most important of these (and      definitely the most rewarding in terms of quick results)      has been our worm farm.    </p>    <p>      Last winter Carolyn and I purchased a few hundred red worms      and put them in a wooden box half filled with a mixture of      yard dirt and compost. I was soon able to put together a      few more boxes and spread the rapidly reproducing wrigglers      among them. Then I added still <em>more</em> containers and      divided the worms again . . . and yet again! There's no      telling just how many of the valuable creatures we have on      hand now (and by the time I finished estimating their      numbers they'd probably have reproduced beyond my guessing      range again).    </p>    <p>      Next spring I plan to "seed" the garden <em>(and all</em>      our fruit and nut trees) with the crawlers, and use the      great mass of worm castings that we've accumulated to fill      the planting beds in our new greenhouse! The latter      structure is small-6' X 120-'but Hans and I      designed and built it ourselves last winter . . . for about      $100! I figure it'll be big enough to serve our purposes,      once we have enough experience to use the little solarium      efficiently.    </p>    <p>      Several of the aforementioned trees-including a navel      orange, a lemon, and a walnut-were already on the      property when we moved in. We've since planted a dozen      fruit and nut producers of our own, though, and are looking      forward to seeing whether we'll get a first scant crop this      year. (It's our hope that we'll be on our <em>own</em>      little farm before the recent plantings reach maturity ...      but putting them in gave us a lot of satisfaction, as will      whatever harvests we can get from them before we actually      take our "final step".)    </p>    <p>      As you can probably imagine, our teenaged son Hans has been      a little slower to appreciate the "rural living in the      suburbs" style than have Carolyn and I. It may be that he's      still too young to recognize the beauty of making the most      of what one has.    </p>    <p>      We've taken a few giant leaps toward changing his mind,      though. Last summer, for instance, Hans's "ag" teacher came      out to our place to instruct us in the finer points of pig      castration. <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to learn how      this relatively simple task is performed, turn to Randy      Kidd's article on page 90.)</em> The instructor was pretty      impressed by what we'd accomplished, and he went so far as      to pass his feelings on to our son, it seems. At any rate,      Hans came up to me a few days later and said-with a      touch of awe in his voice-"You know, Dad, my teacher      says that we have a lot more real <em>agriculture</em>      going on at our little place than most full-sized      <em>farms</em> around here do!"    </p>    <p>      I guess that's true, too. And it sure was nice to get a bit      of outside encouragement a . . just to remind us      that-although we still have a long way to go to      accomplish our dreams-we really have come "a far      piece" from where we started!    </p>
