                    <p>      <strong>Ron Spomer tells you how to roundup some "flying      pesticide" to protect your summer crops.</strong>    </p>        <p>      During the midsummer months, most gardeners find that the      struggle to protect their gardens from grasshoppers,      aphids, and the like rapidly escalates into fullscale war!    </p>    <p>      That needn't be the case, however, because it's possible to      keep your garden's insects under control ... without      introducing damaging chemicals into the environment. The      bug killer I'm talking about doesn't come in spray cans or      plant tablets . . . but it <em>does</em> have a beautiful      package. And-best of all-it's nontoxic, nondisruptive to      the ec ological balance (in fact, it's very much a natural      part of that balance), extremely effective . . . and free!    </p>        <p>      Birds-the ultimate natural pesticidehave been controlling      the earth's insect population for millions of years (just      by doin' what comes naturally!), but it's up to you to      attract the "aerial bug bombs" to your land . . . and to      encourage them to eat the parasites in your garden. You'll      be amazed at just how much the feathered foragers      <em>do</em> consume, too. A tiny swallow will devour 1,000      leafhoppers in 12 hours ... a pair of hungry yellowthroats      make short work of thousands of plant lice . . . a      Baltimore oriole can gobble up 17 hairy caterpillars per      minute .. . a cuckoo will polish off 217 webworms at one      sitting . . . and a house wren may feed 500 insects to its      young in the course of an afternoon.    </p>    <h3>MAKE YOUR GUESTS      COMFORTABLE</h3>        <p>      In order to attract birds to your homestead, you must first      make some reliable source of water available. In a humid      climate, frequent rains and morning dew may provide      sufficient moisture for your feathered friends, or you      might be able to rely on a stream or pond (if there is one      on your land) . . . but it never does any harm to set up a      bird bath. The receptacle can be as simple as a shallow pan      of water placed on a stump, or as elaborate as the carved      stoneware models sold at nurseries. The beaked bathers are      especially attracted to moving water, however, so you might      want to hang a leaky bucket (or a can with holes punched in      its base) over the reservoir, and let it drip into the      liquid below. (Make sure the "tub" is kept clean-and the      water is changed often-so it won't spread diseases.)    </p>    <h3>CHOW TIME!</h3>        <p>      A flying cleanup crew will be most easily drawn to your      place if you can be counted on to provide a reliable source      of food in the winter ... when insect treats are few and      far between. The key is to plan ahead: If you want birds to      de-bug your garden in the summer, remember to <em>feed</em>      them in the colder months. Just keep your end of the      bargain, and they'll return the favor later in the year.      (As a bonus, the hungry flyers will provide you with an      entertaining acrobatic show when they visit your winter      "soup kitchen".)    </p>        <p>      And remember: Once you start providing them with      cold-weather fare, don't neglect the snowbound birds ...      because they'll come to depend on your for food and could      actually starve if suddenly forced to do without their      daily handout.    </p>    <p>      If you have a large yard-or an unused field-you might also      consider planting some seed- and berry-producing vegetation      that offers <em>homegrown edibles</em> to the winged      hunters. Any tree, shrub, or vine that holds its fruit      through the winter (cedar, holly, dogwood, or mountain ash,      for example) can be a lifesaver for bluebirds, waxwings,      and dozens of other species .. . while heavily seeded      plants (such as sunflowers, millet, and corn) will attract      sparrows, quail, and pheasants.    </p>    <p>      But even if you <em>do</em> have space to cultivate      standing crops, it's a good idea to construct a feeding      station as well. The drawings accompanying this article      show several easily built feeder designs.    </p>        <p>      Many wintering birds (which <em>don't</em> migrate) hunt      insect larvae and eggs. Nuthatches, woodpeckers, and      chickadeesfor example-spend the cold months prying into      bark and heaps of dead vegeta tion in search of grubs. But      the hearty flyers can always use a little dietary      supplement . . . so you might add variety to their menu by      setting out a supply of sunflower seeds, suet (beef fat),      and peanut butter.    </p>    <h3>HOME, SWEET HOME</h3>        <p>      Shelter is the final amenity that your avian guests will      need. Birds require cover in which to hide, sleep, and      raise their young . . . and t here are both natural and      artificial ways to provide such "housing". It's often      possible, for instance, to work with your land's existing      vegetation-or plant new shrubs-and create "island habitats"      on your property. You can form bushes into brushy tangles      surrounded by open areas . . . plant hedges along      fencelines . . . encircle your acreage (or just line the      driveway) with small trees ... or put a rose thicket in the      middle of the garden. Try to leave as much "edge" as      possible between the separate plant communities, though . .      . so each bird species can have its own private haven.    </p>        <p>      Be sure you supply a diversity of verdure for your      feathered friends, too. Orioles need to nest in tall trees,      meadowlarks prefer thick grass, and towhees and warblers go      for dense brush. You might also want to combine fruiting      plants with protective varieties such as hawthorn and      cedar, since the "armed" growth will offer secure nesting      sites.    </p>    <p>      And <em>don't cut</em> down all your dead trees, stumps, or      limbs . . . they'll eventually be hollowed out by      woodpeckers, and then used by dozens of "homesteaders" as      snug nurseries. Furthermore, if you see swallows arriving      on your land, be sure to dig a small watery muldhole for      them . . . they'll need to use such "mortar" to construct      their adobe nests under roof eaves and wooden bridges.    </p>        <p>      If you'd like to dramatically increase the size of the bird      colony in your yard, you can often lure in entire feathered      families with specially made nesting boxes. The small,      comfortable structures will provide safe hatching spots,      and several handcrafted "maternity wards"-in various shapes      and sizes-can increase an area's avian population      threefold!    </p>    <p>      It's possible to build simple boxes out of scrap wood (such      as rough, on e-inch pine), but don't skimp by using      <em>thin lum</em> ber, tin, or plastic . . . since birds      often reject flimsy housing. Also, to prevent the      birdhouses from becoming overheated, you should paint their      outside walls alight, earthen color. Leave the insides of      the shelters natural, however, and don't use any toxic      preservatives anywhere on the nesting box. (Consult the      accompanying table for the exact dimensions and      specifications of nesting boxes for different species.)    </p>        <p>      You'll want to position the wooden hideaways all over your      land: Hang some in mature trees . . . nail others to      fenceposts in the pasture . . . hoist a fe w 20 feet in the      air and place some only three feet off the ground. Be sure      , too, that the entrance holes face away from prevailing      winds . . so that the nestlings won't be exposed to      chilling drafts and rain.    </p>        <p>      Usually, you won't have to "furnish" the interior of the      houses at all ... although woodpeckers will appreciate a      padding sawdust or wood chips in their shelters. Most other      species prefer to bring in their own bedding, but you might      want to place a few slabs of tough bark inside the shelters      ... just to make your guests feel at home. And-like any      good landlord you'll need to clean out the boxes after each      nesting ... to eliminate any parasites that may have been      left behind, and to make the "apartments" more attractive      to their next tenants.    </p>    <p>      Once your winter visitors are well fed, watered, and      housed, you can be pretty sure that they'll stick around      through the summer to help limit the bug populations in      your garden. And you can't beat the dependability-or the      safety-of such natural pest control!    </p>
