            		<p> KITCHEN GARDEN </p>        <p>      Pungent kings of the culinary world.</p>     <h5 id="byline">By Sara Pacher    </h5>        <p>      How dull many of our meals would be without onions, leeks,      shallots, chives and garlic! These edible      alliums-members of the Liliaceae, or tile      family-pep up meat, and poultry, lend a crispy crunch      to salads, give soul to soups, are essential to stir-fries      and can be creamed, fried, baked or pickled standalone      dishes. Besides being tasty and low in calories, onions are      healthful, too. The vegetables antiseptic quality makes it      a valuable poultice for infections; onion juice sweetened      with honey is good for cough and colds; and the fresh      vegetable acts as a diuretic, improves low blood pressure      and helps control vertigo. Additionally, when cultivated,      harvested and stored properly, garden-grown alliums can be      enjoyed year-round.    </p>        <p>      Fortunately, humans have seldom been without these verstile      plants. Members of the onion family have flourished in      cultivation so long that their origins are uncertain. Some      think they were first grown in Mongolia; others opt for      Asia Minor. Onions are mentioned in the Old Testament and      were in the diets of those who built the Egyptian pyramids.      Alliums helped sustain the ancient Greeks, and garlic was      considered essential for empire-building Roman soldiers. On      this continent, wild onions flavored the meals of American      Indians for centuries before Europeans arrived. Happily,      alliums are easy to grow-some easier than others. In      fact, one member or another of the onion family will      survive in almost any soil or climate, but different      varieties do have specific requirements, so let's look at      them separately.<br />    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>Onions <em>(Allium cepa)</em></strong> <em><br />      </em><br />    </p>    <p>      Onions come in all shapes and sizes: round (including globe      types, small pear or pickling onions and the large Spanish      varieties); flat, flat-wide, flat-round and half-flat (the      mild-flavored Bermuda onions); top-shaped or pear-shaped      onions (Grano types); and the high-yield, spindle-shaped      Red Torpedo, grown chiefly in Califor nia. Many also come      in red, yellow or white versions, and new varieties are      developed all the time. While most onions can be utilized      as scallions when they're young, perennial bunching types (      <em>Allium</em> <em>perutile and Allium fisulosum</em> )      produce superior scallions and are also practically immune      to pests and diseases. Another perennial- <em>Allium      cepa solanium</em> , known as a multiplier or potato      onion-is propagated by a division of underground      bulbs, with each bulb multiplying into a bulb cluster. And      we mustn't overlook the remarkable Egyptian onion (      <em>Allium cepa vivaparum</em> ), which produces a bulb      cluster at the end of a long stem with a second cluster      frequently forming on top of the first. Egyptian onions      also have underground bulbs, but these are so strong that      usually only the aboveground bulbs are used.    </p>        <p>      <strong>LEEK AND POTATO SOUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOOD STYLING BY SUSAN ERDMANN</strong>    </p>    <p>      4 medium potatoes, peeled and diced<br />      2 cups cold water<br />      4 large leeks, sliced, including some<br />      fine-sliced green tops<br />      1 large onion, chopped<br />      2 tablespoons margarine or vegetable oil<br />      3 cups milk<br />      Dash of cayenne pepper<br />      Salt and pepper to taste 2 tablespoons fresh minced      parsley<br />      1 cup cream<br />      Cook potatoes in water about 10 minutes.<br />      Saute leeks and onion in oil until golden.<br />      Add to potatoes and stir in milk and seasonings.<br />    </p>    <p>      Simmer until the flavors are blended (about 15 minutes).      Add parsley and heat almost to boiling, stirring      frequently. Enrich soup with cream and serve hot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Onion Varieties</strong> Your choice of allium      variety will be determined by climate and by whether you      prefer seeds, transplants or sets.    </p>    <p>      For example, you should always check a cultivar's daylength      requirement. Long-day varieties need the 13 to 16 hours of      daylight of Northern summers to mature. Short-day types      (such as Bermuda and Sweet Spanish) thrive in milder      climates with only 12 hours of daylight.    </p>    <p>      <em>Seeds provide</em> the greatest choice, but onions      grown from seed often take five months to mature, and the      plants they produce can be susceptible to diseases.      <em>Transplants, sold</em> in bunches, are seedlings      started in the current growing season. They usually form      good bulbs. Sets, immature bulbs from the previous year,      are the easiest to plant, the earliest to harvest and the      least susceptible to diseases. Unfortunately, only a few      varieties are available in this form, and not all will      yield good bulbs. (Look for small-bulbed sets, as large      ones may go to seed before producing a good-sized onion.)      For the Middle or Northern sections of the country, try      sets of Ebenezer (early yellow) and Stuttgarter (yellow,      nonsprouting).    </p>    <p>      In the South, pick a firm, sweet, mild Granex type. (The      famous Sweet Vidalia, grown in two Georgia counties, is yet      another Granex. The Walla Walla Sweet is equally prized in      the West.) Sweet Spanish types, such as Fiesta, generally      taste better than yellows and store fairly well. Bermudas      are slicing favorites but aren't good keepers. Good white      storage onions include White Ebenezer in the North and      Granex White in the South. Red onions are normally very      pungent-and, as a general rule, the stronger-flavored      onions keep best of all. When planting bunching onions, you      can't go wrong with the crisp flesh and mild flavor of      White Lisbon. Its dark green foliage is resistant to heat      and cold, and it stays fresh long after being pulled. Once      planted, winterhardy He-Shi-Ko-a perennial with white,      pungent flesh-will add flavor to meals for years,      while Wonder of Pompeii's small, round, early bulbs are      great for pickling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Onion Cultivation<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      The onion bed should be moist but well drained with a pH of      6 to 7. Sandy loam is ideal, but onions thrive in most any      soil if large quantities of well-aged manure, wood ashes      and bone meal in a 5:1:1 ratio are worked in to a depth of      six inches. This vegetable likes cool weather (55° to      75°F) in its early stages. Therefore, plant seeds in      the spring in the North and (depending on the variety) in      the fall or winter in the South. Generally speaking,      frost-hardy onions can be sown four to six weeks before the      last frost date-or even earlier indoors or in a cold      frame. (Mix in some quick-sprouting radish seeds to mark      the onion bed and to lure any root maggots that might be      lurking in the soil away from your allium crop.) Sow the      seeds thickly about one-half inch deep.    </p>    <p>      Thin young sprouts to one inch apart. (When they're started      under glass, transplant to the garden when two to three      inches tall.) Thin again a month later to two or three      inches apart, enjoying the tender rejects in salads and      other dishes. At the same time, dig the soil back to expose      the tops and sides of the bulbs to help stimulate bulb      formation. Position plants or sets two inches deep and four      to six inches apart, depending on whether you plan to      harvest some as scallions. If planting in rows instead of      raised beds, make the rows about two and a half feet apart.      Keep well weeded, but-because onions have shallow      roots-cut, don't pull, any wild intruders. Once the      soil has warmed up, add a thick layer of mulch around and      between the onions to discourage weeds and to hold moisture      in the soil. (Transplants require more water than do sets.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Onion Enemies</strong>    </p>    <p>      Onions are mostly disease- and insectresistant, but keep an      eye out for root maggots (small, white larvae that usually      enter the base of the bulbs and burrow upwards to feed on      the stems) and onion thrips (barely visible larvae that      cause bleached, deformed plants with silvery blotches).      There are, however, preventive measures that can be used to      deter both pests. Root maggots; for example, travel in a      line from one bulb to the next, so their threat will be      reduced if you scatter-plant onions throughout the garden.      (Keep in mind that alliums are good companion plants to      roses, lettuce, carrots, beets, parsnips and members of the      cabbage family, repelling such pests as aphids, Japanese      beetles and carrot flies.) As mentioned, maggots can also      be lured to radishes, which can be pulled up and destroyed      if infested. Also add a thin layer of wood ashes or sand      around the bulbs to discourage adult flies from laying      their eggs at the base of the plants.    </p>    <p>      Use rotenone if all else fails. Thrips overwinter in weeds,      so keep your onion patch clean. If that doesn't work, try      an oil-and-water or tobacco spray, rotenone or pyrethrum. A      cheesecloth cover placed over your crop during May and June      will protect it from the lesser bulb fly, which enters      through the top of the onion bulb. Garlic-and-water sprays      also discourage this pest, along with the garden      springtail, a tiny purple insect with yellow spots. Onion      ailments are confined to smut (black leaves and pustule      patches between bulbs), downy mildew (a purplish mold) and      selfdescriptive pink root and neck rot-all of which      are caused by fungi in the soil. Avoid these infections by      practicing crop rotation, providing good drainage and      working a lot of humus into the onion bed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Onion Harvest</strong> When onion tops turn      yellow, bend them over horizontally with the back of a rake      to stop the sap from flowing and divert growing energy into      the maturing bulb. Once the tops turn brown, wait for a      sunny period to pull or dig the crop, and dry the bulbs on      the ground for a few days. (To prevent sunscald, "shingle"      the onions by letting the tops of one row cover the bulbs      of another.) When the outer skins are thoroughly dry, wipe      off the dirt and dried roots, remove the tops (unless you      plan to braid them), and store your harvest in a cool, dry,      flat place. Hang braided onions or those kept in mesh bags      in an airy spot.    </p>    <p>      With the exception of green onions, which won't keep long      even when refrigerated, mature bulbs can last indefinitely.      Therefore, onions aren't usually canned or frozen. Pickled      onions, however, are a delightful treat. Just cover 10      pounds of small bulbs with boiling water and let them stand      for 2 minutes, drain, dip into cold water, drain again, and      peel. Soak overnight in lightly salted water. Then combine      3 cups of white vinegar, 3 cups of water, 1 1/2 cups of      sugar, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 bay leaves, 2 cinnamon sticks      and 5 whole cloves in a large pot and bring the mixture to      a boil. Add the drained onions and bring to a boil again.      Pack into sterilized jars and cover with the boiling      liquid, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Adjust lids and process      in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes. Makes 10 pints.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Garlic ( <em>Allium sativum</em> )</strong>    </p>    <p>      This perennial is highly adaptable to most parts of the      country, has similar soil requirements to those of onions      and likes cool temperatures during its early growth. It      also needs plenty of sun. If you want to grow garlic from      seed, California White is popular; Giant Cajun Garlic      offers extra-large, mild bulbs; Mexican Garlic is pungent      and hardy; and elephant garlic-Allium      scorodoprasum-produces one-pound, milder than-average      bulbs. Most people, however, use the cloves of store-bought      white garlic bulbs. These can be planted about eight weeks      before the last frost or in the fall if mulched heavily      where winters are severe.    </p>    <p>      Separate each segment gently (the larger cloves usually      produce the largest bulbs) and place them, plump side down,      one to two inches deep and four to six inches apart. Rows      should be at least one foot apart, but you'll probably want      to scatter garlic throughout the garden for its insect      repelling properties. Don't, however, plant it near your      peas or beans, as legumes don't care for garlic companions.      Once in the ground, garlic will care for itself if you keep      weeds down and don't let the soil dry out.    </p>    <p>      To produce larger bulbs, remove the flowers that appear on      the leaf stalks. Watch for signs of onion thrips, root      maggots and downy mildew, though such problems are unusual.      When garlic tops are about one foot tall, stop watering.      Once the tops begin to droop, knock down the foliage to      speed up the curing process and-a few days      later-loosen the soil and pull out the entire plant.      Dry in a cool location with low humidity to keep the bulbs      from molding. Remove the tops and store like onions. The      bulbs will last for several months-or up to a year if      wrapped and refrigerated. Use generously in recipes, for      garlic contains vitamins C and B, phosphorus, calcium and      potassium, as well as allicin, a chemical with antibiotic      properties that can minimize the effects of colds, aid the      digestive tract, ward off traveler's dysentery, help      control high blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart      attacks and arteriosclerosis. Garlic sprays repel insects      and can deter dis eases such as downy mildew, cucumber and      bean rust, bean anthracnose and early tomato blight.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Shallots ( <em>Allium ascalonicum</em> )</strong>      It's surprising that grocery-store shallots are so      expensive, because the plants are very easy to grow.      Extremely adaptable to practically any soil or climate,      this allium is beautiful, with its graceful, bright      blue-green stem, and its gray, angular, mild-flavored bulb      (related to the multiplying onion) is a favorite of French      chefs. (A young scallion is eaten whole, while the mature      bulb is used like a milder, superior-flavored garlic.) As      with garlic, it's best to make your shallot sets by      dividing bulb clusters purchased from a store's produce      section. (The only true shallot seeds available are the      Louisiana variety.) Each shallot will multiply and produce      four to eight new bulbs.    </p>    <p>      Shallots aren't particular about soil, disliking only very      acid spots, but the earth must be well dug, because the      plants send feeder roots down to a depth of eight inches.      However, they have no lateral roots, so the cloves can be      planted close together. Plant them about one inch deep      (barely cover the tip of the clove) and two to three inches      apart in February or March. Light feeders, shallots like a      little phosphorus but don't require rich soil. They can      also survive dry spells, but-for the best      growth-keep the soil weedfree and slightly moist.      Around June, draw the soil away from the bulbs. Though      growth stops with freezing temperatures, shallots are very      hardy and also will tolerate both low and intense light      conditions, flourishing best when temperatures are in the      mid-70s and daylight hours are long. Shallots can be      harvested as green onions at any time, and if the tops are      cut off near the soil, they'll produce new ones.    </p>    <p>      In fact, cutting the tops and using them as you would      chives will promote bulb production. Bulbs mature in about      five months. At that time, pull them up, cut off the tops,      dry, and store them in a cool place-saving the      healthiest looking bulbs for next year's crop.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chives ( <em>Allium schoenoprasum</em> )</strong>      The early-spring, grass like chive has been enjoyed for      centuries in Britain and Europe and for thousands of years      in China. Though fairly tolerant of most soils and      locations, it rewards the gardener who gives it a      humusrich, moisture-holding home with superior flavor and      succulence. (Poor soil can even cause chive tips to      yellow.) The germination of spring-sown seeds will be slow,      and the first year is likely to be unproductive. Impatient      gardeners should set out chive clumps, which will be ready      to harvest two months later. Each clump should contain      about six bulbs, and the clusters should be spaced eight      inches apart. Every third year, dig up, divide, and replant      in another section of the garden. Chives are not evergreen      and will die back, so-before the first      frost-put a few clumps in pots, cut back the leaves      to about two inches, and bring them indoors for use in      winter dishes. Whether indoors or out, constant cutting is      necessary to keep up an ongoing supply of leaves. Flowers,      though attractive, also should be cut of.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Leeks ( <em>Allium porrum</em> )</strong>    </p>    <p>      Switzerland, Algeria and the Eastern Mediterranean all      claim to be the original home of the leek-and,      indeed, any place would be proud to claim this wonderful      allium. It's very easy to grow, is resistant to pests and      diseases and can be harvested fresh from many gardens      throughout the winter so make sure to plant a large crop,      because this is the sweetest and most delicate-flavored of      all the onions. Though not very popular in this country,      leeks have been prized in ancient civilizations for three      or four thousand years.    </p>    <p>      Leeks thrive in temperate climates (growth will slow above      90°F) and will withstand temperatures several degrees      below freezing. Though they prefer crumbly, rich loam, such      as woodland humus, they will do well in most soils if      well-rotted manure or good compost is worked in deeply.      However, they require a lot of moisture and dislike weeds.    </p>    <p>      Depending on the variety, leeks take from 70 to 110 days to      mature but can be harvested as green onions some three      weeks earlier. Their flavor is best, however, after the      first frost. To get a head start, sow seeds indoors in      flats two to three months before setting them out. At three      inches, thin the seedlings to one inch apart; when five      inches tall, thin to two inches apart. At about eight      inches, transplant to the garden, placing seedlings in      six-inch deep holes spaced six inches apart, and fill the      hole with water to anchor the roots. When the plants are      pencilsize, carefully bank up the soil around the lower two      or three inches to blanch the leek, to improve both its      appearance and its delicate flavor.    </p>    <p>      And how you'll love that flavor! Where temperatures seldom      fall below 10°F, just pull leeks from the garden      throughout the winter. In colder climates, ball them up and      keep them in a box in a cool, dry place. Use them in any      recipe that will be enhanced by a delicate onion      flavor.(The long, white stem is most commonly eaten, though      the sharper tasting green tops are good, too.) Serve them      in wilted-spinach salad. (Saute chopped leeks and garlic in      a little bacon grease, stir in spinach leaves until wilted,      and serve topped with crumbled bacon.) If young and tender,      leeks can be creamed and used as an excellent topping for      toast. (Saute in butter, simmer, and add a cream sauce.)    </p>
