    <p>
                         <p>      From mid-September, through Christmas and into the new      year, tons and tons of a particularly delicate and      delicious wild fruit go to waste-as far as humans are      concerned -over a tremendous area of rural America.      From the fence rows of Appalachia to the Ozarks, all      through the southern Gulf states and even into the milder,      fruit-growing regions of Michigan and the Great Lakes      country the woods and roadsides, abandoned fields and      eroded wastelands now covered with second-growth brush are      dotted and lined with . . . wild persimmons in full fruit.    </p>    <p>      A persimmon tree burdened with ripe fruit is really      something to see! Every branch and twig and stem may be      crowded with the luscious golden globes of goodness. Not a      yellow-gold, but more of a flushed apricot with pinkish      overtones.    </p>    <p>      It's strange that most of this bounty is never harvested      because everyone likes juicy, aromatic, dead-ripe      persimmons cooled by morning dew and bursting with sweet      flavor. And why shouldn't a persimmon be good? The pulp      contains as much as 34 percent fruit sugar, making it      perhaps the sweetest of all nature's gifts.    </p>    <p>      It is this very sweetness, however, that limits the use of      the fresh fruit because each luscious morsel is like a rich      bonbon and only two or three persimmons are enough to cloy      the appetite.    </p>    <p>      There's another reason so few persimmons are gathered: The      fruit is edible-and <em>only</em> edible-when      it's reached a stage of full ripeness so fragile that it      almost melts in the hand and a fall from the tree to hard      ground can make it splatter. Really ripe persimmons are      about as delicate and difficult to handle as a soap bubble.      If you cheat and pick one even a little bit firm and      unready, it'll be as bitter as gall and cause your lips to      pucker into a twenty-four hour kiss.    </p>    <p>      What to do? What to do?    </p>    <p>      Most of us are content to eat one or two ripe persimmons      during a fall walk through the woods and let the birds and      beasts harvest the rest. And they do harvest! Everything      that creeps, crawls, walks or flies loves ripe persimmons      and will gorge on them at the slightest opportunity.    </p>    <p>      Persimmons mature at just the right time for wild creatures      that are storing body fat against the cold and famine of      winter. Racoons, `possums, squirrels, deer, rabbits,      groundhogs, chipmunks, mice and shrews all share the feast.      Robins, mockingbirds, thrushes, crows and other birds peck      the golden fruit before it falls to the ground. Flies and      gnats swarm around crushed persimmons while lizards and      strange creepy-crawlies from under leaves and fallen logs      rush to join the banquet.    </p>    <p>      There is no particular reason for haste however, because      wild persimmons do not ripen all at one time like other      tree crops.    </p>    <p>      Some country folks insist that it takes a sharp frost to      make persimmons soft and edible, but the experienced      woodsman knows this is nonsense. The persimmon is ripe and      edible when it is soft as a baby's cheek, and this can be      as early as mid-September with temperatures still in the      80's or as late as February after nights have dropped below      zero.    </p>    <p>      There is wide variation in the trees of a given area and      even in persimmons from the same tree. Some will soften and      fall early while others remain hard, astringent and clamped      on their limbs until dry as prunes or dates. Indeed,      certain varieties of persimmon are referred to by natives      as "date-Plums", although they are neither.    </p>    <p>      Ripe wild persimmons, because of their delicacy, can never      be widely available in fruit markets      and-therefore-are rarely utilized by modern      homemakers. The fruit was an important food source for the      Indians, however, and a dessert for pioneers who learned      the art of preservation from red neighbors. The secret is      in drying the pulp: The same method used by our forefathers      to preserve apples, peaches, pears and many kinds of      berries and grapes in the days before pressure cookers and      canning supplies were available.    </p>    <p>      Persimmons have to be gathered daily or every other day      during the ripening period. Only those that fall on a      grassy turf or soft growth of weeds or leaves will be      undamaged and bruised or torn fruit is quickly destroyed by      insects, animals, fermentation or souring.    </p>    <p>      If enough hands are available, many persimmons can be      gathered undamaged by holding a sheet under a tree while      the tree is gently shaken. Each persimmon has to be      individually inspected, however, to make sure it is at the      soft-ripe stage of perfection. Just one astringent fruit in      a half bushel can spoil an entire batch of pulp.    </p>    <p>      The average ripe persimmon is round and about an inch and a      half in diameter. Each contains from two to six large seeds      surrounded by juicy, sweet pulp and separating seeds from      pulp presents a problem worthy of the talents of Eli      Whitney. The ordinary colander or food mill doesn't work      well for this since the seeds are large, hard, slippery and      extremely difficult to remove. We've never been able to      learn how the Indians or our grandparents did the job and,      perhaps, they were content to simply mash the whole fruit      and dry everything together. This seems impractical,      though, because of the large percentage of seeds to pulp.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, a moment of happy inspiration solved this      annoying problem and now enables us to process and preserve      our family supply of persimmons without too much effort.      Among our kitchen utensils, we found a small two-handed      press known as a "potato ricer". It's inexpensive and      available from any hardware store. The soft, ripe      persimmons are simply dropped into the press, squeezed and      the sweet orange-colored pulp scraped from the sides and      transferred to a container. Waste seeds and skins are then      removed in readiness for the next batch. By this means, a      peck of persimmons can be processed in about an hour and      will produce approximately two quarts of pulp.    </p>    <p>      Looking at this fragrant orange pulp, the innocent      homemaker will immediately think: "Oh, I can just add sugar      and a little lemon and cook up a batch of delicious jam for      the winter."    </p>    <p>      Alas, it cannot be. Even the gentlest cooking of persimmon      pulp seems to bring back the astringency and makes it      inedible.    </p>    <p>      The pulp can be frozen and stored in deep-freeze or      refrigerator compartments. It may darken when thawed but      there is little loss of the delicate flavor. Freezing and      freezer equipment are not always available to the flower      children and others interested in the simple life and a      return to nature. For them, drying offers the easiest      solution.    </p>    <p>      The Indian method was to spread a quarter-inch of pulp on a      peeled log and let it remain until sun and air-dried to the      consistency of tough leather. Of course, the pulp had to be      protected from rain and roving animals during the ten days      or longer it took to cure.    </p>    <p>      Once dried, the pulp was called "persimmon leather" and      could be kept almost indefinitely if protected from      dampness and mould. This was usually accomplished by      hanging the slabs by thongs from tipi poles or the kitchen      rafters of a settler's log cabin. Smoke from cooking and      heating fires helped to preserve the dried fruit and keep      insects away.    </p>        <p>      We find that a cookie sheet is more practical than a peeled      log and dehydration can be speeded by using an oven's low      heat.    </p>    <p>      When desired, the persimmon leather can be cut into small      pieces and eaten like candy. It is much relished by small      children this way. Or, the dried pulp can be mixed like      raisins with cornmeal and other cereals to make Indian      puddings, various cakes and biscuits.    </p>    <p>      Maybe times haven't changed so much after all. Today, just      as in grandfather's time, there is an ample supply of      delicious fruit ready to preserve for the winter's stores      at no cost other than your own pleasant labors.    </p>
