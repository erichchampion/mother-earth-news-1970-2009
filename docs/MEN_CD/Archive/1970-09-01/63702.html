                    <p>      <em>It's as predictable as weeds in an August garden.      Mention "welfare" to the Great Middle Class and a      stereotyped image - accompanied by much raving and      ranting</em> <em>–</em> instantly flashed across      Agnewland: Young, black woman in some big city with four      illegitimate children and more on the way, permanently      lollygagging about at the expense of "us honest,      hardworking taxpayers". Kind of strange isn't it: The      Pavlof response never seems to include the families in      Appalachia whose farms were stripmined by a company that      moved on, took its jobs with it and left... nothing. Nor      the old folks whose home and business were destroyed by an      urban "development" ... nor the young father dying of      cancer... nor the children starving in Georgia because      "boss" only pays their daddy $5.00 a day and, that, just      during cotton season... nor the old lady blinded by      glacoma... nor even the young, white, middle class working      people ("the company lost the contract and closed the      plant, you know") that needs a little help till something      ("anything") turns up. The truth of the matter is that      welfare was designed to do some particular jobs and –      whenever those jobs need doin'      <em><em><em>–</em></em></em> it should be used.      Furthermore, when it IS used <em>–</em> since our      government seems able to afford moon shots and insane wars      <em>–</em> welfare should provide something more than      a bare existence. A little compassion thrown in wouldn't      hurt either.    </p>    <p>      At the end of 1968 over 10 million Americans collected      public welfare in one form or another. But for every      individual who received a welfare grant, perhaps two more      were eligible! I will attempt to explain the welfare system      to you in order that you "know" the facts. If you think you      are eligible after reading this, GO TO YOUR LOCAL      DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE AND APPLY!    </p>    <p>      Public welfare has long been this country's favorite red      herring. Because of our puritanical heritage, we have been      graced with that Protestant ethic of ethics which says "No      work, no bread!" As a natural extension of this train of      thought we have added that the poor must be "worthy" as      well as needy. And worthiness is measured in terms of how      much crow one will eat in order to collect welfare: the      more the crow eaten, the higher the welfare grant.    </p>    <p>      People, welfare is a right, not a privilege. It is      guaranteed in the Federal Constitution that all people have      the necessities of living. For fact, one need not even be a      citizen! One need only be eligible.<br />      In order to see how welfare works, I should first explain      how it is financed.    </p>    <p>      All public welfare as we know it today in the U.S.A. came      about due to the Social Security Act of 1935 which carried      a provision that: States should insure that their residents      have the necessities; states set guidelines for these      necessities; and that federal money would be given to      states to develop programs within the states to see that      poverty was eliminated. However, it was not until the      Kennedy years that real teeth was given to the welfare      program.    </p>    <p>      The 1964 amendment to the Social Security Act outlined the      various aid categories we still use (to be explained      later), and allowed the states to organize and administer      these programs using federal money. The states then      authorized the counties to organize departments of public      welfare, and to regulate and administer these same programs      using state and federal matching funds. So long as federal      and state guidelines were followed, the county was      reimbursed up to 95 cents per each welfare dollar spent.      Thus a breakdown of the welfare dollar runs 75 cents      federal, 20 cents state and 5 cents county. There are a few      county programs which are financed solely by county funds,      such as General Assistance and County Medical.    </p>    <p>      Guidelines that were set up included insuring that a family      receive the proper amount of aid to which it is eligible,      insuring that a worker receive so many cases as a maximum,      insuring that a supervisor have no more than five workers      to oversee, etc. Public welfare departments, however, know      how to cheat and doctor figures. So do state departments of      social welfare. In other words, the figures are always      false <em><em>–</em></em> they just look good enough      to get federal financial reimbursement.    </p>    <p>      The federal programs that are available include:    </p>    <p>      1. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC or      ADC)<br />      2. Aid to Disabled (ATD)<br />      3. Aid to the Blind (AB)<br />      4. Old Age Assistance (OAA or OAS)<br />      5. Food Stamps or Commodities Programs    </p>    <p>      I shall now attempt a short outline regarding these      programs and the county aids one may be eligible to receive    </p>    <h3> 1. ELIGIBILITY FACTORS</h3>     <p>      AFDC:<br />      So long as a child exists in at family that is deprived of      income to support that child; AFDC is possible. Neither      natural parent need be present in order that AFDC payment      be collected. Usually the child cannot be older than 18 in      order to get AFDC, unless lie remains in school full time.      In this instance, payment would continue until the child      reached 21. If the family in question has a working father      as head of household, the family is NOT eligible to AFDC.      If the father is not working, the family is eligible to a      special AFDC-U (unemployed male breadwinner in family).      However, female breadwinners may work and still receive      AFDC for their children. This will be explained later under      INCOME.    </p>    <p>      Grants depend upon number in the family, age and sex of      family members, and the state maximum allowable. In other      words, grants vary from state to state. Property holdings      cannot exceed $600 in liquid assets (bank accounts, stocks,      bonds, auto, bank notes, insurance with cash surrender      value, etc.). Residence used to be a factor. However the      Supreme Court in April 1968 knocked down all state      residence requirements for welfare. One need only be      physically present and INTEND to remain permanently to be      eligible.    </p>    <p>      ATD:<br />      This is for disabled people 18 to 65 who are physically or      mentally incapacitated from seeking gainful employment or      as in the case of housewives, unable to perform household      duties. Property holdings cannot exceed $1200 for one in a      family, and $2000 for two adults. Real estate holdings must      be utilized (an owned home that is being occupied is      considered utilized, and is okay). Residence is the same      for AFDC. Grants vary from state to state but are flat      grants (all ATD recipients receive the same amount).    </p>    <p>      AB:<br />      This category is the same as ATD except one must be      legally, not totally, blind to be eligible.    </p>    <p>      OAA:<br />      Same as ATD except that the person must be 65 or over.    </p>    <p>      FOOD PROGRAMS:<br />      All those recipients of cash welfare grants are      automatically eligible for stamps or commodities. BUT you      need not be receiving welfare in order to get surplus food      or stamps.    </p>    <p>      This depends upon your income. You can be working and still      have an income below the federal eligibility requirements.      Check this out with your local public welfare office. The      program varies from county to county, some use stamps while      others use commodities. The stamps work as follows: for      every $20 of stamps you purchase with cash, you are given      an extra $6 of stamps. Commodities are surplus government      foods given free at food distribution points.    </p>    <p>      <br />      II. COUNTY PROGRAMS.<br />      Sometimes you are not eligible for any of the above      programs but you may be eligible for county aid. First is      General Assistance or Relief. This is a cash grant, very      little, which is given for a short time only. Single,      employable men CANNOT receive ANY cash aids other than bus      tokens and tokens for a bed for the night. Women without      families can receive GA, but for a short time at most. GA      is usually given to those who are waiting for the federal      program to take effect (while they remain under an      investigationary period, they receive GA). Anyone needing      medical help can receive it from the county hospitals under      the County Medical Program. Its cost depends upon you      financial status. There are some "rehabilitative" programs      in counties. These are more like road farms for single,      unattached men with nowhere to go. They are usually for the      birds.<br />    </p>    <p>      III. SPECIAL NEEDS.<br />      Special needs include cash grants above and beyond the      regular cash aid payment. Only federally reimbursed      programs have a special need allowance. Special needs run      from extra money for a telephone, medical transportation,      special diet on AFDC aids, to laundry and house repairs on      OAA aid. Best check with the social worker, or even better,      look this up in your state welfare manual. Workers may not      know all the regulations themselves. Some do, but act like      they were the personal guards of the public coffers and      refuse to tell you all that you might be eligible for in      order to keep cash grants down.    </p>    <p>      IV. OTHER INCOME.<br />      One may receive other income and still be eligible to      receive aid. This depends upon the amount of the other      income and the amount of public aid. If the other income is      less than your grant, it is subtracted from the grant, and      you get your grant less other income. But the total remains      the same.    </p>    <p>      For example, suppose you receive $155 for ATD, and social      security awards you $105 per month disability. You would      then begin receiving only $50 from ATD plus the $105 from      social security, but the amount of $155 stays the same.      Female breadwinners may work and still collect AFDC for      their children. There remains a very liberal allowance to a      working mother so that most of her paycheck can be      eliminated from welfare consideration, eg., child care      payments, auto payments, transportation, lunches, special      clothing on the job, books if applicable, etc. When all of      these are removed from her paycheck, only a small portion      may be counted as income and removed from the AFDC grant.      Child support is also removed from AFDC grants.    </p>    <p>      Special favors over a continual time are construed as      income. For example, free rent can cause your grant to have      the rent portion removed. Free board removes the food      portion and so on. Gifts on special occasions are not      income unless the amount is sizeable. Clothing gifts are      never counted as income.    </p>    <p>      V. MARS.<br />      Man Assuming Role of Spouse has also been one of welfare's      bugaboos. In essence, it states that any man who lives with      a welfare family in a spouse-like relationship is      <em>presumed</em> to be supporting the family, hence the      family may be cut off from aid. As of April 1970, the      Supreme Court reversed this due to a California case. Now,      welfare departments are obligated to prove that the man is      supporting the family before aid can be stopped.    </p>    <p>      This means that as long as the man can provide for himself,      he does not have to leave the home      <em><em>–</em></em> or even support anyone in the      home <em><em>–</em></em> in order for that family to      receive AFDC. At most, the female parent of the children      may be excluded from welfare payments. Before this      decision, the boyfriend of a welfare mother had to keep one      step ahead of the welfare investigators ...now he can stay      all night!<br />    </p>    <p>      VI. CHILD SUPPORT.<br />      Another problem with welfare programs is child support.      Most states make it a felony for the male parent to escape      paying child support whether he lives with the child's      mother or is even married to her. Most states also have      reciprocal agreements with each other so that child support      dodgers can be arrested and returned to the original state      making the complaint. The counties are in charge of this      program, and the district attorneys have special      departments to do nothing but child support prosecution and      investigation. When a mother applies for AFDC she must      first sign a Failure to Provide statement against all the      natural fathers of her children. These statements can be      used to prosecute and even jail those fathers who refuse or      avoid payments. If the mother refuses to sign these forms,      she may also be refused aid. Some counties of some states      will put her through the ringer during their investigation      into the whereabouts of the father(s). She may be reduced      to a sobbing, screaming blob before they finish with her.      Some counties refuse to have any witnesses in the room      during this questioning in order to protect themselves from      lawsuits    </p>    <p>      My best advice is to have a lawyer present. Legally, the DA      cannot refuse you the right to be represented by a lawyer.      This will save you a great deal of stress and embarassment.      Oh yes. There is one aid category in which children can be      held financially responsible to their parents! OAA states      that all children must be contacted to see if they can help      the parent.    </p>    <p>      VII. SPECIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS.<br />      There are various work incentive programs, retraining      programs and the like. These can be inspected for      possibilities by contacting your local welfare office or      the state employment service. You might also investigate      higher education programs which sometimes are available.      Welfare would underwrite the cost of tuition, books,      transportation and living money while you get a college      education!    </p>    <p>      Lastly, there are special children's programs. These      special programs include extra money for foster care. There      are in this world some very mean, psychotic parents of      children who take their own inadequacies out on their      children. Neglect, abuse, and abandonment are the losers in      each case. Of all the welfare programs, Child Protective      Services is possibly the most humane. It insures that      parents who neglect or abuse their children are watched,      but mainly helped with intensive social work services so      that the problem stops. If this cannot be done, the      children are removed from the home and placed in foster      care.    </p>    <p>      No one, not even welfare, likes to split up a family. But      the first time you see an abuse case is the last time you      want a child to remain in the home of psychotic parents.      Most large cities have this program. If not, the juvenile      division of the police department or sheriff's department      can be of help. Remember, children cannot fend for      themselves. It is not interfering to intercede on behalf of      a child! If you know of parents who mistreat children, call      your local welfare agency or police department and have the      matter investigated. You may be saving the life of the      child.    </p>    <p>      VIII. HOW TO APPLY.<br />      Look up the name of the nearest county public welfare      office in the phone book; it is usually listed under your      county Department of Public Welfare. Go there. Request an      application and a social worker. Remember that you cannot      be refused to sign up for any aid program. Welfare can      always deny aid, but it cannot deny request to apply for      aid. Also, you do have the right to at least talk to a      social worker. For family aids, you will need birth      certificates or some official papers for the children, and      marriage certificate and divorce papers if applicable. For      adult aids, you might need particular information. In the      case of ATD and AB you will need medical information      verifying your illness. If you have personal or real      property, these must be seen by the social worker in order      to qualify.    </p>    <p>      There you have it. If you meet these "simple"      qualifications sign up. One last word of advice, if I may.      Join your local Welfare Rights Organization. WRO is      composed of welfare recipients who are dedicated to raising      welfare grants so that people on welfare don't starve, and      to uplift welfare recipients so that they are something      more than "the lost generation". WRO realizes that welfare      is a right, and one need not ask, with meekness, for what      is legally and rightfully his. WRO demands that every      welfare cent to which a person is eligible must be given      him. WRO works for the recipient's best interest. If there      is a WRO in your area, join it, if, there isn't, organize      one!    </p>    <p>      And best of luck.    </p>    <p>      RAY SCHWARTZ    </p>
