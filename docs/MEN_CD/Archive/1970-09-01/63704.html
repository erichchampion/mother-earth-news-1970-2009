                    <h5 id="byline">by VICTOR A. CROLEY</h5>    <p>      When grandpa came home from the War Between the States, he      was 24 and in a hurry to settle down to some worthwhile      living. Business was in a severe depression following the      war I boom but the federal government had passed the      Homestead Act offering free land – with additional      concessions to veterans – for those who could "prove      up" by living on the land and farming it for a prescribed      number of years. Grandpa, with wife and two small babies,      was among the first to take advantage of that offer.    </p>        <p>      The family soon found themselves on the Nebraska frontier      with all their household goods packed in a canvas-covered      wagon. They had no home and the spindly wild plum thickets      and sparce cottonwoods along the few streams were not trees      enough for the log cabins they had known back in Ohio and      Indiana.    </p>    <p>      Shelter was the first essential and grandpa and the      hundreds of other homesteaders who pioneered with him were      resourceful men. They had brought a few farming tools along      and first in importance was the heavy iron breaking plow.      Drawn by a team of horses or oxen, this instrument could      turn up an eighteen inch ribbon of the thick virgin prairie      sod. The strip could then be cut into two foot sections,      four to six inches deep, to make an almost perfect building      block.    </p>    <p>      The first – and most desirable – homes were      simply small rooms dug into the lee side of a low rolling      hill. The walls were built up with sod blocks to a height      of seven or eight feet. Holes were left for doors and      windows which were usually store-bought and hauled from the      nearest town or railroad point. Cottonwood poles laid side      by side, then spread with a thick layer of coarse prairie      grass to provide insulation and prevent dirt from sifting      through, formed the roof. Over this was carefully fitted a      double layer of the sod building blocks. The first good      rain started this sod to growing and soon the dugout roof      was covered with waving grass. The grass almost concealed      the roof but did not affect its insulating or protective      properties.    </p>    <p>      The floor of the dugout home was of rough wooden planks if      the family could afford to buy them. Otherwise, it was      treated as the neighboring Indian squaws treated their tipi      floors: Sprinkled with water daily and swept with crude      grass brooms until the surface was a hard and smooth as      finished concrete.    </p>    <p>      Walls of the sod houses were lined with newspapers pasted      or pinned up with small, sharpened sticks to keep the, dirt      from brushing off. Some of the more ambitious families      located outcroppings of limestone rock which they burned      and mixed with screened sand to make a plaster coating for      the walls.    </p>    <p>      The dugouts were amazingly comfortable homes; cool in      summer, snug and easily heated in winter. The thick sod      walls and roof made excellent insulation in a day when few      knew or appreciated the value of insulation. When properly      located on the south side of a low hill, with adequate      drainage to provide run-off for rain and melting snow, the      dugout was probably as comfortable a home as any our      pioneering forefathers ever knew.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the pioneer dugout had a very short life. It      couldn't stand prosperity. The fertile Nebraska prairie sod      – turned over in the fall and broken down to mellow      richness by winter snows, freezing and thawing –      produced bumper crops of corn and small grains. With money      in the bank, the status symbol was a clap board house and      grandma couldn't be satisfied until she had gotten her      family out of "that hole in the ground" and into her      uninsulated clapboard structure: A house that was stifling      hot in the summer and poorly heated in the winter by      buffalo chips in the kitchen range or costly storebought      coal that had to be hauled from town, carefully hoarded and      sparingly doled out.    </p>    <p>      Prosperity put an end to the dugout in little more than a      decade of pioneering, but a few pictures still exist to,      show how these homes looked and memories and journals of      the oldtimers record the dugout's comforts and advantages .      . . advantages that are still available to today's      pioneers, homesteaders and freedom folk who want to get      away from big city congestion and find a quiet, simple life      close to the land.    </p>
