        <p>The wild foods article in Issue No. 3 said that after dandelions flower you should leave the plant and go on to other foraged fare. But a nice lady gave us a recipe for dandelion wine that's supposed to have health giving properties. We made it and it's great. Here's the formula for one gallon:</p><p>Early in the morning when the dew is on the flowers, pick one gallon of <em>perfect, open</em> dandelion blossoms.</p><p>Put the flowers in a two gallon or larger open crock and pour boiling water over them. Cover the crock with cheesecloth and let it sit at room temperature for three days. Then squeeze all the juice outta the flowers, throw them away and save the liquid.</p><p>Put the liquid into a big pot and add:</p><p>3 lbs. sugar (we used brown raw sugar for healthiness but next time we'll try honey for healthierness. The nice lady used white (ugh) sugar.)<br />3 or 4 lemons, juice, skin, seeds, etc., all chopped up.<br />3 or 4 oranges, chopped</p><p>Boil mixture for 30 minutes with top on pot, cool to lukewarm, pour into crock and add 1 1/2 or 2 packages or tablespoons of yeast. Cover with cheesecloth and let brew sit for two or three weeks 'til the bubbling stops and - whammy!</p><p>Filter through cheesecloth to strain out chunks and save vitamins. Bottle.</p>
