                    <p>      OK, gang. Here it is. In answer to many requests for      information about immigrating to and homesteading in      Canada, we've put together the following twenty-one pages.    </p>    <p>      Since our space is small and Canada is large, this report      is necessarily a very random sampling. For more detailed      and specific information, contact the appropriate office or      offices listed on paged 30-31.    </p>    <p>      By the way, we're becoming convinced that abandones      back-tax land in Canada is probably more attractive than      raw unsettled Crown Land. There's less red tape involved,      actually less out-of-pocket expense in some cases and      always the chance of picking up an old house, farm      buildings, a well and – maybe – easy access to      power lines in the bargain. Check it out and see what you      think.    </p>    <p>      Two good agents for back-tax land are listed on page 27 in      Paul Conroy's article.    </p>    <p>      The first thing you've got to realize is that the immigrant      business is pretty good in Canada these days. In addition      to a steady flow of new faces from England, other parts of      the old British Commonwealth and Europe, 22,785 independent      souls from the United States (double the number of 1961)      emigrated to the Maple Leaf Country in 1969 . . . and the      first quarter of 1970 ran about one-third ahead of the      corresponding quarter last year.    </p>    <p>      Now these are not all young and impecunious draft dodgers      either. One quarter of the folks making the big move in      1969 were doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers (especially      teachers!) and other professional people. And the U.S.      immigrants (in our fine old tradition of "biggest and      bestest"), took more money into Canada with them than all      other immigrants combined.    </p>    <p>      What this means, of course, is that the competition is      getting heavier. Or – to put it another way –      with greater numbers of better qualified applicants wanting      in, the Canadian Immigrations Offices can afford to become      progressively more selective . . . and they have. I guess a      third way of describing the situation is to say that you      now need money and an established career to buy a new start      in life.    </p>    <p>      We're advised that, until about three years ago, a U.S.      citizen applying for Canadian landed immigrant status was      viewed as just that: A U.S. citizen. Acceptance was almost      automatic. Nowadays,'however, DISTINCTIONS are made and      each applicant from the U.S. is graded on a super-secret      point system.    </p>    <p>      The new evaluation scale is SO secret, by the way, that      – researching this issue – we were given no      straight answers by any of the official Canadian Government      spokesmen we contacted. Luckily, though, MOTHER has an      unexpected friend (who must remain nameless) within the      very government of our neighbor to the north and that      friend tells us:    </p>    <p>      Canada's immigration laws operate on a point system. The      applicant gets points for having a job to go to (or a skill      that is highly in demand in Canada); for having sound      financial resources; for having an education. Thus, if you      are a professional man with about $10,000 and a job waiting      (which, by the way, is an approximate profile of the      majority of immigrants from the United States in recent      years) you can make the points in a walk.    </p>    <p>      Two important warnings: (1) If you apply for landed      immigrant status from inside Canada, you lose points.      Application should be made to an immigration office at a      Consulate – General or at a border crossing point.      (2) Although military status and political attitudes are      not official considerations in determining elegibility,      there is always a highly subjective element in the decision      of an immigration officer. That's a bureaucratic way of      saying, "Comb your hair so your ears show." In fact, why      not cut it? It keeps on growing, right?    </p>    <p>      A piece in the July 17, 1970 issue of LIFE followed one      emigrating family north from this country and, in a few      words on page 44, reinforced the above statement:    </p>    <p>      To become "landed", an applicant needs a minimum of 50 out      of a possible 100 points based on such things as education,      job training, special skills, and on motivation, initiative      and other intangibles generally summed up as "character".    </p>    <p>      So, it would seem that your best bet lies in NOT drawing      across the border with $100 in your pocket as a "tourist,"      and applying for Canadian citizenship later. If you want in      and expect to stay, go about it the other way around.    </p>    <p>      Let's say your situation is the worst possible: You're      young, flat broke, know no one in Canada and you would like      to become a landed immigrant as soon as possible. How will      you do it?    </p>    <p>      (1) Get the best-paying job – any job – RIGHT      NOW that you can. Better yet, get two of them. It doesn't      matter if you like them or not. You won't be doing them      long. The money you can make in a short period is your      primary consideration at this point.    </p>    <p>      If you're a couple, you can both moonlight and hold down      four jobs between you. Save every penny you can. Within six      months you can have anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 in the      bank. I've done it and you can too.    </p>    <p>      (2) Write to the largest newspapers that serve the area or      areas of Canada that interest you most. Get the addresses      from a library. Send each paper a dollar and request      AIRMAIL the LOCAL edition of the next Sunday paper. Out of      town editions of large Sunday papers quite often do not      contain the classified ad section, and that's what you      want.    </p>    <p>      As soon as you get the newspapers, fire off an AIR MAIL      SPECIAL DELIVERY letter of application for every job for      which you might qualify. Request, by mail, application      forms from each employment agency that advertises in the      papers. Fill out the forms and send them back, putting      special emphasis on any skills you may have that the      employers in that area seem to want.    </p>    <p>      Now, don't really expect too much at this stage but, you      never know: Lightning may strike and – suddenly      – you'll have a job waiting for you in Canada. Even      if nothing clicks, you'll have some contacts –      someone who "knows" you – when you apply for landed      immigrant status.    </p>    <p>      (3) Get the forms for landed immigrant application, study      them, hone and rehone your answers, fill out the forms      NEATLY and submit them as you enter Canada or BEFORE.      Remember, you'll lose points if you do it after you're in      the country.    </p>    <p>      (4) Write to the private land dealers and government land      agencies that service "your" area (if you're going back to      the land) well before you are ready to make your big move.      Get all approp6ate reports and maps. Study them.    </p>    <p>      You'll want to speak with authority if anyone questions you      closely about your future plans. You may even find, on      examination of this material, that your first choice for      locating in Canada isn't so appealing after all.    </p>    <p>      (5) If regulations really tighten up, there are ways of      appearing more financially stable than you actually are      when you cross the border:    </p>    <p>      (a) Borrow all you can from friends, relatives and even      banks or loan companies just long enough to get you past      the line.    </p>    <p>      (b) You can always magically double – in the eyes of      others – what you SEEM to be worth by depositing the      money you do have in a bank savings account and returning      in a few weeks to say you've lost your account book. The      bank will give you a card to fill out and, in a week or so,      you'll be issued another. When you withdraw the money      you'll keep the original book and your cash-in-hand plus      the phantom account may put you across the border when the      cash alone would not. Devious? Yes. But then, so is the      bureaucratic red tape you're fighting. Besides, the      "motivation" and "initiative" involved here should be      exactly what Canada's evaluation system is supposed to      value. I wouldn't make a point of mentioning that to the      immigration officer, however.    </p>    <p>      (6) There's another angle on jobs that you might be able to      work if you know anyone at all in Canada. I'm sure the job      "waiting" for you – if you have one – must be      genuine but I see no reason why a friend already in that      country couldn't obtain some land (homestead, homestead      sales, back tax, private sale or whatever) and then "hire"      you as, say, an organic gardening expert to manage the      farm, market produce, etc.    </p>    <p>      This could probably be taken even one step further. The      friend might purchase the land with your money in the first      place (assuming you had it and he didn't) and – once      you're officially in Canada – sign the deed over to      you.    </p>    <p>      What I'm saying is, if you're young, without money and      connections but determined to emigrate to Canada and build      a new life for yourself, there are ways to do it in spite      of the restrictions and red tape.<br />      <strong>YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU TRY.</strong>    </p>
