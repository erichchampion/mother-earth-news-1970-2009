                    <h3>      Mother’s Garden Essay Contest prompted many responses      - here are our favorites!    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Our First Gardening Adventure</strong>    </p>        <p>      There are many reasons that my boyfriend and I dig      gardening. We are both 22 years old and started our first      organic garden together this past summer. We grew on a plot      of previously untouched land in Meding, Ohio. In order to      be sure that we are eating the healthiest food (free of      chemical fertilizers and pesticides) with the highest      nutritional values, we knew we’d have to produce it      ourselves. This allowed us to make a connection with our      Mother Earth while being self-sufficient and living a      naturally healthy lifestyle. We learned a lot about the art      of composting, beneficial insects and organic fertilizers.      This hands-on experience will aid us in pursuing our future      as organic farmers.    </p>    <p>      We loved our gardening adventure because we were able to      share our love for healthy, nutritious foods with our      families and friends (and their families, too!). Our      understanding continues to grow about the importance of      taking from Mother Earth her beautiful gifts, but more      importantly, returning to her an equal amount of love and      care. With the proper care, knowledge and love, our plants      bloomed to perfection. We love to garden and look forward      to the ongoing give-and-take relationship we have with the      Earth and each other. Our plans for a much larger      vegetable, flower, mushroom and herb garden are coming      together for 2006. We look forward to working together to      produce healthy, nutritious foods and beautiful flowers for      all to enjoy! We’ve learned what a little hard work      and dedication can do, and that is what we dig about      gardening!    </p>        <p>      Miranda Marcano and Brandon Pappas<br />      Mansfield, Ohio    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Astounding Taste of Fresh Food</strong>    </p>    <p>      What happened to me yesterday - awakening to find      myself in a kitchen that smelled like my grandma’s      - wasn’t something I’d counted on when I      decided to subsidize our grocery bill with a garden. Before      I knew it, I’d re-entered my childhood. I walked the      lane to my garden day after day, planted, waited and      replanted.    </p>    <p>      Finally my harvest began. I got a canner and began making      tomato sauce, pickles and relish. I froze corn, peas and      beans, and shelled lima beans for the first time since I      was about 10. My kitchen smelled of strawberries, pickle      brine, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cabbage.    </p>    <p>      In all of this activity, I found a kind of peace and      wholeness that eluded me when I was making hurried dashes      through the grocery store and reaching for clean,      attractive produce that got “rained” on      periodically from the sprinklers above the displays. In the      busyness of driving to and from work, I’d gradually      lost my enthusiasm for putting food on the table.    </p>    <p>      At first, my own garden produce was much less attractive      than the kind I bought in town. It was amazing how much      time I spent picking, scrubbing, peeling and otherwise      preparing food. But I was completely astounded by the taste      of fresh food, available day in and day out. Often      I’d sit down to a meal and remark, “Everything      we’re having tonight is from the garden.”    </p>    <p>      Joanne Lehman Apple Creek, Ohio<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Companionship and Memories</strong>    </p>        <p>      Aunt Lou is my companion, recounting witty stories as I      tend my plot. Soft meringue hair and moonstone eyes; artist      and poet. I see her weathered red Formica counter and the      “compost holder” that rested on it: a small cup      that constantly spilled all manner of vegetable scraps. At      86, stooped with osteoporosis, she would putter out to her      small garden and bury the day’s offerings with a      broken shovel. This Depression kid didn’t throw away      anything useful. Her tomatoes testified to their good      upbringing.    </p>    <p>      Memories of Gram are all about food and hugs. As a child,      we were co-conspirators at the table, cackling and snorting      at secret jokes. I would keep her company as she’d      bake with my mother, watching her gnarled old fingers      working the paring knife around an apple, producing one      continuous, exquisite peel. Laughter filled the room as we      constructed pies.    </p>    <p>      Later, Mom is with me as I tuck the seeds into their      welcoming beds. We plot and plan what will be frozen and      what will be canned, licking our chops. I see her facial      expressions: concentration as she pushes the tomatoes into      their jars, satisfaction as she inspects the finished      product. Now, I grin happily at every “ping”      that emanates from my cooling jars.    </p>    <p>      My labs, Maggie (yellow) and Sally (chocolate), make a      looping orbit around me. They are the gardening goofballs,      chasing frogs and stealing tomatoes. Performers, not      farmers. I appreciate their show, basking in the warmth of      both the sun and the presence of those who came before.    </p>    <p>      Cara Proehl<br />      Columbia Station, Ohio    </p>    <p>      <strong>Staying Connected</strong>    </p>    <p>      For me, gardening is somewhat of a guerrilla affair, as I      employ methods that the people around me have never heard      of. We had some compost and topsoil trucked in from a local      garden center, and I spread it around the perimeter of our      back yard. I didn’t dig into the existing soil at      all. We placed some landscaping material over the ground      and then shoveled the imported soil over it.    </p>    <p>      Another step I didn’t take was to box the bed in with      lumber slats or any other kind of constraint. No one      believed that the soil would stay where it was meant to. I      knew it would. The soil I use is very rich with organic      material such as horse manure, straw and other      unidentifiable humus.    </p>    <p>      I planted a variety of vegetables, herbs, berries and      wildflowers, not in normal rows but more like clumps. I      mulched the plantings with dried grass clippings to help      them retain moisture, then fertilized with blood meal and      fish liquid.    </p>    <p>      My garden is abounding with life- not only plant      life but ladybugs, spiders and the like. By employing      organic gardening methods and enjoying success with them,      I’m encouraging my neighbors and friends to do the      same. I believe it is a small effort I can make in the      struggle against rampant fossil fuel misuse, as well as      creating a haven for the wildlife that urban sprawl      displaces. It is a way for me to stay connected to the      natural world.    </p>    <p>      Leah Patterson<br />      Calgary, Alberta    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gardening is Paradise</strong>    </p>        <p>      Blue morning skies, ohia trees bursting with red blooms,      afternoon clouds bringing showers and rainbows, a full-moon      whale watch from the cliffs of South Point toward the vast      Pacific Ocean - what more could one ask of paradise?    </p>    <p>      For me, the answer is gardening! No matter where my      wanderings have taken me on this lovely planet, life is      never complete without a food garden. To observe paradise      is incomplete. I must dig, plant, tend and harvest to truly      touch the soul and life of any land. This is what I love      most about growing my own food - the mysterious      essence of life itself passing through my hands, entering      my thoughts and heart as I watch each miraculous leaf      unfold, each flower bloom, each fruit form. How can I put      into words the taste of a ripe avocado from our orchard?      The pleasure of a bucketful of oranges every morning in      May? The brimming buckets of lima and green beans all      summer?    </p>    <p>      My husband started this organic farm in Hawaii. The      partnership that has evolved over the last 11 years has      sustained me through trials and hard times. Depressed Go      sit with the chickens in the free-range field and watch      their antics. (Chickens love to eat bananas and papayas,      and nab live mice running from a mower!) Overwhelmed Spend      time with the sheep in the macadamia nut field and adopt      their stress-free pace. Grieving Do some watering in the      tropical early morning light.    </p>    <p>      Farming challenges abound - voracious insects, root      rot, unbelievable weeds, unpredictable weather patterns and      “regulars” (zucchini, tomatoes) you cannot grow      outside a greenhouse. But when all your successes finally      grace your family’s table - well now, that is      true paradise.    </p>    <p>      Pearl Maxner<br />      Naalehu, Hawaii    </p>    <p>      <strong>Blissful Connections</strong>    </p>    <p>      Inexplicable joy ... This is the feeling I get when I      garden. As a child growing up in the city, my parents      afforded us the experience of having a small vegetable      garden and even a few chickens and ducks. I dug the dirt      and planted in the family garden but had little      appreciation for the activity until my own garden healed me      in a way I cannot truly describe.    </p>    <p>      I started this vegetable garden to grow some of my favorite      vegetables. Then the need for ornamental flowers and shrubs      began to call, and the garden chores began to swell. It was      work and not very pleasurable at all.    </p>    <p>      Then, in the summer of 2004, my precious young nephew      passed away after heart surgery. My family was devastated.      I was lost. My 23-year-old nephew had been a chef and loved      the fresh vegetables and herbs that I grew in the garden.      It was something that we shared and enjoyed. After he died,      I expanded the garden and included a new section in memory      of him. When I work in the garden now it is not a chore; it      is my time to connect with loved ones that passed on to me      a love of gardening and of family. It is my time to heal      and nurture. It is bliss.    </p>    <p>      Tracy Carter<br />      Nashville, Tennessee    </p>    <p>      <strong>Giant Pumpkin Pride</strong>    </p>        <p>      I remember with horror being awakened as a child on      Saturday mornings at 6:30 to weed the garden. I could never      understand my father’s pride in his garden.    </p>    <p>      My father and I lost track of each other for several years.      But we were reunited when I purchased my      great-grandfather’s 1920s farmhouse from my dad. Soon      I was planting my own small garden. My interest sparked      Dad’s interest in me. He and I worked together to      reclaim a three-acre parcel of the land in order to open a      vegetable stand. These were awesome gardens!    </p>    <p>      My father’s obsession with growing giant pumpkins      blossomed into his life’s ambition-to grow      the world’s largest pumpkin. Even after being      diagnosed with cancer, he maintained those pumpkins. My dad      was in the hospital when he heard the news that he had      broken the world record with a whopping 1,337-pound pumpkin      (shown at left, with Charles Sr.).    </p>    <p>      Scott Cully, a professional pumpkin sculptor, contacted us      about carving the great beast. That monster was carved and      ready for the Guinness World Record cameras before      Halloween in 2002. Dad was so proud as he sat with his great carved      pumpkin for the news crew. He died in August 2003, having      been a great father, husband, grandfather and friend. As      for me, I continue to grow my garden every year and try to      inspire interest in my son and daughter.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes when my family and I are gathered around the food      that I have grown, I have a sense that my father is      present. I hope that my children feel their      grandfather’s, as well as their father’s, love      for them.    </p>    <p>      Charles Houghton Jr.<br />      Weare, New Hampshire    </p>    <p>      <strong>No Better Feeling</strong>    </p>    <p>      There is a kind of spirituality I find only by gardening. A      special peace and solitude, a feeling of being one with the      universe. The sun, warm on my back. The feel of soil,      sifting through my gloveless fingers. The scent of earth      and water. Tiny seeds carefully placed in pockets of moist      compost, to emerge days later as wee green leaves. A      rebirth each spring.    </p>    <p>      Optimism is indispensable to having a garden. There must be      trust that insects and critters will take no more than      their share and confidence that there will, indeed, be a      harvest. Each seed and every transplant is a gesture of      faith. The birds and worms frequently get more peas than we      do. Even so, I will plant them again next year.    </p>    <p>      I can think of no better feeling than serving a meal made      with my own fresh produce. I await the first radish each      year with the same eagerness I had as a child. The last      tomato picked before frost always makes me a bit sad.      I’ve spent many winter evenings engrossed in seed      catalogs. My husband says I seem happiest with dirt under      my fingernails. I must say, I think he’s right.    </p>    <p>      Mary Cibulka Brown<br />      Eastsound, Washington    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        My Secret Weapon      </h3>            <p>        My four children are involved in a myriad of activities        that keep us busy year-round. We have an extensive        organic fruit and vegetable garden - a rarity in        our situation where fast food is the norm. Why do we do        it? Initially, it started as “Mom’s        hobby,” but over the years, I have realized        something important: It gives my kids an edge. Feeding my        family healthy, organically grown food, while others rely        on convenience foods, makes my children healthier,        smarter and stronger. This is a highly unscientific        statement, but I have the attendance records, grades and        medical records to prove it. Combined, my four children        have missed fewer than 10 days of school. Their grades        are stellar. I grudgingly reveal my secret to the readers        of <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> … I believe it has a lot to        do with our organic garden.      </p>      <p>        The thing I dread to reveal is the ongoing state of my        garden. In this hectic lifestyle, there is minimal time        to keep my precious garden weed-free, pest-free or        immaculate. Our garden typically is a mess! Thankfully        the veggies still tend to grow. Our garden is not very        pleasing to the eye, but we don’t let it stop us!      </p>      <p>        Jacqui Coming<br />        Double Oak, Texas      </p>    </div>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        A Wholesome and Rewarding Pursuit      </h3>            <p>        When we think of “gardening,” we think of        earlier years when America was sustained by the family        farm. Each family member was important and shared a        common goal of providing for the survival of the family.        Although nutrition is of vital importance to us, the        training of our children is probably the most important        reason to garden. Just as seeds need to be planted in the        best growing medium, nurtured along the whole process of        growth and tended carefully as individual plants, so it        is with children.      </p>      <p>        As we garden together as a family, we continually see the        parallels between cultivating plants and raising children        to be healthy, confident and productive members of        society. Gardening together gives each of us, from the        littlest to the oldest, a sense of belonging and purpose.        As we share this common endeavor, we are tied together,        each contributing as able to the overall goal: the        productivity of the garden.      </p>      <p>        Character is instilled with the challenges of hard work        and planning and researching individual plant needs.      </p>      <p>        As we sit around our table enjoying the tasty, nutritious        fruit of our labor, we think of a time soon to come, when        we shall also rejoice in the fruit that has been        developed in each of our children. When we see the end        product, we will know that all the hard work will have        been worth it. Gardening is one of the most wholesome,        rewarding and productive pursuits in this life.      </p>      <p>        Dan and Kelley Siefka<br />        Hillsdale, Michigan      </p>    </div>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Rare Native Seeds      </h3>            <p>        My gardening experience started with a small box of seed        being placed in my hands by Momfeather Erickson. Short in        stature but big on dreams, this Cherokee elder chose our        family to put out the first heirloom garden for Mantle        Rock Education and Culture Center, in order to grow seed        stores for the Cherokee community. The rare seeds came        from archaeologists and tribal members.      </p>      <p>        Our Amish neighbor broke the virgin clay soil with his        two horses. To enrich the soil, we added composted yard        clippings, vegetable scraps and manure. Gardening        organically called for learning how to furnish the plants        with proper nutrients while keeping weeds down and bugs        under control.      </p>      <p>        We anxiously awaited the first sprout and carefully        recorded the day it emerged, comparing each type of bean,        squash, pumpkin and corn. Eventually, my husband and I        had the wonderful opportunity to share rare vegetables        from our garden with our community        - ‘Miami’ butter beans, ‘Trail of        Tears’ runner beans, ‘Banana’        muskmelons, ‘Omaha’ pumpkins, ‘Black        Aztec’ corn and ‘Pawnee’ popcorn.        Momfeather Erickson will use the ‘Black        Pawnee’ beans we strung (left) to make a feast with        traditional “leather britches” soup this        fall.      </p>      <p>        On Sept. 5, 2005, I sit in my cabin with 15 boxes of        native seed ready for next year. At this point we have        tasted, canned, strung and preserved our seed. This was        more than I expected!      </p>      <p>        I now have a true understanding of why people dig        gardening.      </p>      <p>        Marilyn Konstanty<br />        Marion, Kentucky      </p>    </div>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Rare Foods and Relaxation      </h3>            <p>        After a busy day, the first thing that welcomes me home        is the fresh smell of my garden. Full of joy, I pick up        my shovel, till the soil, plant new seeds and pick some        vegetables for dinner. All my stress melts away. It seems        like a miracle-green buds sprouting up from the        ground.      </p>      <p>        As an immigrant from Korea, I plant vegetables and fruits        that are rarely found in the United States. It is a good        way to introduce Korean foods to my children. The        vegetable we are holding in the photo is        ‘Hobark,’ or ‘Korean Winter        Squash,’ which can be made into sweet soup and rice        cakes all winter.      </p>      <p>        Our backyard garden is my favorite place. Once the seeds        are planted, the earth always keeps its promise by        presenting fresh green buds. Plowing the garden has given        me not only a peaceful time to think and dream, but also        great health. And that is why I shovel and sweat every        single day.      </p>      <p>        Paul Park<br />        Lompoc, California      </p>    </div>
