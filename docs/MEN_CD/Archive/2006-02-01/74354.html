        <div id="countryLore"><h3>A Rustic Bookshelf Made from an Old Ladder</h3><p>My husband and I recently bought our dream home on 20 acres. We spent so much time (and money!) working on fences, irrigation and outbuildings that, eight months later, all our books were still boxed in the garage. We were reluctant to shell out $125 for a particleboard bookshelf. Then I had a great idea: I took a weathered 25-foot wooden ladder from behind the barn and cut it into four equal lengths to make supports for two bookshelves. For the shelves, I used reclaimed wood from a barn. I left the ragged edges and the ladder hardware for effect and bolted the units to the wall for safety. I now have bookshelves that are unique and look great. They didn't cost us a dime, and I spent a great Saturday morning putting them together. Now we're considering making rustic benches and tables from the remaining barn wood to pepper the house with charm -- it should be a fun winter!</p><h4>Mariah Zabriskie<br />Burbank, Washington</h4><h3>Easier Egg Peeling</h3><p>Regarding the August/September 2005 "Country Lore " tip on peeling hard-boiled eggs: I put a couple tablespoons of vinegar in the water while the eggs are boiling. The shells crack easily and usually come off in two pieces. The vinegar does not affect the taste of the eggs.</p><h4>C.W. Travers<br />Chambersburg, Pennsylvania</h4><h3>Invisible Glue Secret</h3><p>When using epoxy resin to glue porcelain or china, mix a dab of paint that's the same color as the china into the epoxy before applying. This will eliminate the shadow line you get when using clear epoxy.</p><h4>Allan Koskela<br />Webster City, Iowa</h4><h3>Nifty Tool Holder</h3><p>When you complete a fencing project, it is always a challenge to find a use for the fencing material left at the end of a roll. I was about to tuck a small roll of vinyl-covered fencing into a corner of the garden shed, when I realized that it could be used to store small garden tools. I loosely stapled some of the 2-by-3-inch mesh fencing to the inside of the shed door frames. To store trowels and similar tools, I just poke the handles through the mesh. I used vinyl-covered garden wire to make hooks to hang items that won't fit into the mesh.</p><h4>Charles McKelley<br />Leander, Texas</h4><h3>Natural Strategies for Cholesterol Control</h3><p>I recently went to the doctor to have my cholesterol checked. Previously, the doctor had prescribed medication to help control it. The doctor and I were both pleasantly surprised that my LDL was down 95 points and my total cholesterol was down 88 points! Then she said, "The medication is really working for you. " Well, surprise, I hadn't been taking the medication she prescribed. What I had done was make three little changes in my life -- nothing drastic or dramatic, but obviously effective.</p><p>I had always been fairly conscientious about my diet, eating balanced meals and keeping junk food to a minimum. I was less than 20 pounds over my ideal weight, and I did a modicum of exercise. Despite this semihealthy lifestyle, my cholesterol levels had been creeping up over the past 12 years.</p><p>I read everything I could find about cholesterol. I finally narrowed the success factors down to three: elimination of saturated and trans fats, increased fiber intake and regular exercise.</p><p>It was fairly easy to substitute olive oil for butter or margarine. The mild/light version does not have an oily taste; as a matter of fact, it is almost tasteless. For foods that demand a butter flavor, I add butter buds to the oil. Also, my day now starts with whole-grain cereal to which I add golden raisins and 1-percent or 2-percent low-fat milk.</p><p>These two adjustments are the only actual changes I have made to my diet. I have always eaten whole-grain bread, brown rice, plenty of vegetables and more chicken than beef. Just imagine if I hadn't!</p><p>The final lifestyle change was to exercise on a regular basis. After all these years and many attempts, I have accepted the fact that I cannot do this on my own; I must belong to a class. I exercise at least three times a week for 30 to 40 minutes each time.</p><p>So, those are my three little lifestyle changes. They are quite painless, but very effective. The bottom line is that my doctor told me that my cholesterol figures indicated I no longer needed to take medication!</p><h4>Genevieve riggs Williams<br />Snellville, Georgia</h4><h3>Rollin' Up the Wire</h3><p>We have found a new way to wrap up miles of electrical fence wire. We had an old wheeled garden-hose reel with a crank that would no longer work for the hose.</p><p>We used it to wrap up about a mile of electrical fence wire in about half the time it normally takes us. I attached one end to the spool while my husband walked the fence line and unhooked the fence from the insulators. Once he got to an end, he held a little tension on the line while I cranked it up neatly on the spool.</p><p>The wheels make it easy when we need to put the fence back up. We just roll the reel to where we need to run the fence. The wire stays neat and untangled.</p><h4>Anne Marie Duhon<br />Opelousas, Louisiana</h4><h3>Freezer Cold Frame</h3><p>I have discovered that an old chest freezer makes a good cold frame to start seeds. I place 5-gallon buckets filled with water, which act as thermal mass, in the bottom of the freezer. On top of the buckets, I set the trays of soil and seeds on old refrigerator shelves. I tape plastic sheeting to the top back edge of the freezer, under the lid. For the front and sides, I fold over the sheeting to make sleeves to hold metal pipes that keep the plastic from blowing off. When it's warm and sunny, I open the freezer lid and fold the plastic back. When it's near freezing, I reposition the plastic and close the freezer lid. Rain has filled about a third of the freezer, but I have left it for additional thermal mass. The extra humidity seems to help the sprouts, and I don't have to carry water from the faucet to water the flats.</p><h4>Betty Goolsby<br />St. Paul, Arkansas</h4><h3>Free Plants</h3><p>You can get a new garden for free by organizing a seed/plant swap. If you don't have interested friends or neighbors, you can contact churches, schools, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and other organizations. Also, local garden clubs may have seed and plant swaps in the spring that you can join.</p><p>When I get the urge to start a new flower bed or fill in the bare spots, I first check what I have in stock -- this goes for inside and outside plants. Perennials and spring and summer bulbs can easily be divided; daffodils, crocuses and day lilies are fast multipliers. Rooted cuttings and saved seeds also are great to trade. This way, I usually get new varieties to add to my collection at home.<br /><br />Herbs such as sage, thyme and chives can be dug up and overwintered indoors. Divide them in spring, keep some and swap the others. Houseplant cuttings are always in demand. Unusual plants are more desirable and make better bargaining tools. Don't forget to include compost in your bartering endeavors. Many gardeners don't have room or take time to make compost. I have found that a bag or two of good compost can be worth its weight in free plants!</p><h4>Cindy Kerschner<br />Palmerton, Pennsylvania</h4><h3>Land Ho! But Investigate Before You Buy</h3><p>Here are some tips for when you are ready to shop for land, based on the experiences of myself and my wife. With persistence, planning and just a touch of compromise, you can find country property that will fit your needs for a lifetime.</p><ul><li>Decide what you're looking for. Write down all your needs for land, employment and community, then try narrowing down that list to must-haves.</li><li>Know how much you can afford and how you want to pay -- mortgage, cash or land contract. Check out Rob Roy's book, <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=709" target="_blank">Mortgage-Free! Radical Strategies for Home Ownership</a>.</li><li>Thanks to the Internet, you can look for land anywhere in the United States with a mere click of the mouse. Once you have identified the area of the country in which you want to live, go for a visit to get a feel for the area. Also, learn as much as you can about property values, city and state taxes, nearby hazards, school bus routes, mail delivery, etc.</li><li>A real estate agent can help you start looking for property. Real estate agents do a great deal of the work associated with buying property, and they know what's happening in the community. Also, search for rural property in the local paper and ask around town if anyone knows of a property that might soon be for sale. Post notes in businesses such as laundromats and farm supply stores.</li><li>When you've identified a couple of realistic land options, it's time to start walking properties. Be sure to have your "needs " list with you so you don't forget any critical elements.</li><li>Above all, ask the real estate agent and seller a lot of questions. Ask about the land's prior use and about hunting practices or ATV trails in the area. Check on water rights, mineral rights and utility easements.</li><li>You'll want to have a copy of a survey of the land so you'll know its exact boundaries. If a relatively recent survey is not on file or the owner is not able to show you the corner markers and lines, then you will want to have a survey done before closing on the property. Surveyors are a bit like Indiana Jones. They'll pore through old records to find clues for property boundaries, then bushwhack through the property to find those clues. Once the survey is complete, the land's boundaries will be clearly marked and you will get a survey map and a full report.</li><li>Make sure there's deeded access to the property. If the access is across someone else's property, it should be a deeded easement. If you take out a mortgage, a title search will be done to assure that the owner is the legal owner and can legally sell the property. If you pay cash or do a land contract, always have a title search done, even if you have to pay for it. Be extremely wary of a quitclaim deed, which could signal that the seller's claim on the land may not be legally valid.</li></ul><h4>Craig Idlebrook<br />Ellsworth, Maine</h4><hr /><h3>Do You Heat Your House With Wood?</h3><p>If so, we would like to hear your thoughts on why you love your woodstove, 300 words or less, please.
