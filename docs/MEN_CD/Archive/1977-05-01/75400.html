                        <p>      <strong>Friends of the Earth is one of the most effective      environmental groups in the world today. Although FOE      publishes its own journal-a monthly tabloid called      <em>Not</em></strong> <em><strong>Man Apart</strong></em>      <strong>?far too few of MOTHER's readers regularly see a      copy of <em>NMA</em> . . . which is why we've agreed to      publish this column, written by the FOE/ <em>NMA</em>      staff.</strong>    </p>    <h3>BIG APPLE GETS CLEAN AIR</h3>    <p>      The city of New York has discovered that no amount of      whining over its financial problems can sway the      determination of concerned citizens to have clean air. In      two landmark decisions-handed down recently after      more than a year of legal challenges and appeals-the      Second Circuit Court of Appeals told the city in no      uncertain terms that it must begin immediate enforcement of      the Clean Air Act.    </p>    <p>      Friends of the Earth was a major plaintiff in one of the      cases, <em>Friends of the Earth v. Hugh</em> Carey      (Governor of New York State). The aim of FOE's suit was to      get New York City to carry out the provisions of the      Transportation Control Plan, an air cleanup program which      city and state agencies had proposed as their own vehicle      for complying with the Clean Air Act of 1973.    </p>    <p>      In the three years of the Transportation Control Plan's      existence, city officials had done nothing but try to back      out of their commitments. It would have been legally OK for      New York City to revise the Plan . . . but instead, Mayor      Beame fought enforcement of the measure and cried that his      financially beleaguered city was being forced to accept      impractical environmental priorities.    </p>    <p>      In reality, the Transportation Control Plan is anything but      impractical: implementation of it is expected to bring the      city annual revenues of $140 million. The Plan calls for      [1] a partial ban on taxi cruising, [2] a curb on parking      in the central business district, [3] a study of after      hours goods delivery, and [4] the placing of toll booths on      currently toll free bridges over the East and Harlem rivers      (the money from which would go to subsidize mass transit).    </p>    <p>      FOE originally got into the act back in 1974, with the help      of attorneys from the Natural Resources Defense Council.      Early court decisions had held that citizens' groups      couldn't take governments to task over this sort of thing,      but FOE and other groups appealed and the court finally      accepted the plaintiffs as "welcomed participants in the      vindication of environmental interests".    </p>    <h3>VOLTAGE REDUCTION SAVES ENERGY</h3>    <p>      Northern California's Pacific Gas and Electric Company      announced recently-with surprisingly little fanfare-that it      would reduce its service voltage levels by approximately      three percent . . . a move that is expected to result in      the savings of a whopping <em>one million barrels of oil      per year.</em> (Best of all, this energy savings required      no technological breakthroughs, large investments of      capital, or federal grants to achieve . . . just a little      workaday tinkering with substation equipment to bring line      voltages down from 126 to 122 volts, or thereabouts.)    </p>    <p>      The strategy behind voltage reduction isn't difficult to      understand. Household appliances, light bulbs, and small      electric motors are (at least in this country) designed to      operate on electricity that falls within a standard range      of 114 to 126 volts. The electric companies-for      reasons of their own-have traditionally kept their      line voltage at the top of this range . . . but it turns      out that if the upper limit is lowered from 126 to 122      volts, a three-percent energy savings is effected. (If it's      lowered to 120 volts, the saving is five percent.) Because      the voltage is never allowed to drop below 114 volts,      however, all household equipment continues to work normally      . . . in some cases, better than normal! (For example, a      60-watt light bulb will last 1,000 hours at 120 volts, or      1,700 hours at 115 volts . . . but only <em>600 hours</em>      at 125 volts.)    </p>    <p>      What's hard to understand is why the concept of voltage      reduction has-to date-received almost total      neglect by the electric power industry. Only after years of      prodding by two California Public Utilities Commission      engineers and a show of support from a local consumer group      (Toward Utility Rate Normalization) did PG & E decide      to put the concept to the test and prove its amazing      effectiveness.    </p>    <h3>VERMONT TOWNSHIPS REJECT NUCLEAR      POWER</h3>    <p>      Vermont's time-honored political institution, the town      meeting, has helped unite the state's residents in their      rejection of nuclear power. Last March 1, voters in 35      towns throughout the Green Mountain State adopted Town      Meeting Day resolutions banning nuclear power plants within      their townships and forbidding the transportation, storage,      or disposal of radioactive wastes within township limits.      Leaders of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group      (VPIRG), which sponsored the resolutions, see the election      results as an indication of broad public opposition to      further nuclear development in Vermont.    </p>    <p>      VPIRG supported its own resolution (a model for the many      different measures adopted by the individual townships)      with direct-mail and radio advertising campaigns. Officials      of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation-which      operates the state's one existing nuclear      facility-countered VPIRG's efforts with scare stories      of a plant shutdown, raised rates, and possible      jeopardization of the state's energy supply.    </p>    <p>      Although the VPIRG resolution was intended to serve      primarily as a test of public sentiment, the town of      Brattleboro may soon put the resolution to a real      <em>test.</em> At present, all truck shipments to the      Vermont Yankee plant pass through Brattleboro . . . but as      this is being written Brattleboro is considering the      adoption of an ordinance that would forbid the      transportation of nuclear wastes through the town. If the      ordinance passes, Vermont Yankee may challenge the legality      of the Town Meeting Day resolutions.    </p>    <p>      Vermont's single state Representative, James Jeffords, has      been moved by the controversy to investigate the      possibility of introducing federal legislation that would      give town resolutions greater clout. Vermont governor      Richard Snelling, however, doesn't like the idea of      individual communities interfering with state energy plans.      Nor does he favor a proposed bill that would forbid the      storing or reprocessing of nuclear wastes in Vermont      without the state legislature's approval. "I would oppose      that portion of the bill that gives Vermont the right to      say it will not accept its share of the consequences of a      national energy policy," Snelling said.    </p>   <h3> BRIEF NOTES</h3>    <p>      The Tennessee Valley Authority is running out of domestic      uranium sources. TVA Chairman Aubrey Wagner admits that the      TVA has only enough uranium to last three or four years      once all 17 planned nuclear generating stations are      operating . . . . FOE and six other groups have filed suit      to block funding for the B-1 bomber. The suit alleges that      the U.S. Air Force-in blatant contravention of the      provisions of the National Environmental Policy      Act-prepared an environmental impact statement that      failed to consider alternatives to the controversial bomber      . . . . The Iranian parliament has decreed that anyone who      uproots a tree greater than ten centimeters (four inches)      in diameter will be put in jail for three years. No word      yet on how many violators have been caught.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      To become a member of Friends of the Earth-and      receive their excellent publication, Not Man Apart, year      round-remit $20 to FOE at 124 Spear, San Francisco,      Calif. 94105.-MOTHER.    </p>
