        <p>It has now been eight years since the summer of 1969 . . . the summer when we began laying the groundwork for this magazine. In some respects those eight years have sped by as rapidly as eight weeks (where <em>did</em> the time go?). But in so many exhausting ways, those years have been more than the equivalent of eight full lifetimes.</p><p>We've all been through a great deal since 1969 that we'd rather not have gone through. The unnecessarily dragged-out conclusion and end of an insane war in southeast Asia. Criminals in the White House. Lies and duplicity from every level of Big Government, Big Business, and Big Labor. Two devaluations of the dollar. Starvation in the Sahel. Double-digit inflation. Increases in the incidence of cancer. The oil embargo. Massive oil spills. Kepone in Virginia, PBB's in Michigan, and PCB's almost everywhere else. The biggest recession since the 30's. Giveaway grain deals to Russia and China (supposedly the enemy) at the same time soybean shipments were arbitrarily shut off to Japan (supposedly our friend). Runaway nuclear reactors. Terrorists here and abroad. Rumors of atomic weapons being assembled from "peaceful" plutonium in all parts of the world. India's explosion of just such a device . . . proving the rumors true. Confrontations in Lebanon, Palestine, and other parts of the Middle East. Secret arms deals, secret spy deals, and secret economic deals . . . . . . . . . all made by politicians sworn to "open" administrations. OPEC dollars and tired old Keynesian economic theories sloshing back and forth from one nation to another and disrupting all the currencies of the world. Busing riots in Louisville and Boston and other cities. More drugs and crime and pollution and traffic snarls in our urban areas . . . and an increasing amount of the same ills spreading across the countryside. The Alaskan pipeline and all the environmental and economic dislocations it has wreaked-and continues to wreak and <em>will</em> wreak-on our 49th state and most of this continent's west coast. Earthquakes. Once-fertile soil destroyed for all time at a rapidly increasing rate by strip mining . . . and severely damage-year by year-by clear-cutting, pesticides, herbicides, petrochemical fertilizers, ever-larger machinery, and all the other tools of "agribiz". The rights of the middle class-the "backbone" of any stable society-trampled at an accelerating rate. Bankrupt cities, bankrupt corporations, and bankrupt banks . . . all bailed out with printing press money. Ballooning federal deficits. Detroit's defiance of EPA standards for new car exhaust emissions. The winter of '76-'77. Drought in the West and floods in the East. Dust storms once again in our Midwest.</p><p>Need I go on?</p><p>To be sure, we (the little people of the world and the planet itself) have made <em>some</em> gains. We did defeat the U.S. SST (although, it must be admitted, the opposition does continue its campaign to weasel the British/French SST into airfields on this continent . . . and our wimpy politicians, sooner or later, will probably give in). And the tide here in the United States <em>is</em> now running against aerosol packaging and throwaway containers of all kinds. And even the diehards are slowly beginning to realize that the horrors of atomic energy (the health hazards it presents to every living thing for all eternity and the absolutely frightening terrorist hazards it presents to all of us now) can never be outweighed by any economic advantage (and, besides, nuclear energy <em>has</em> no economic advantage . . . just ask Westinghouse).</p><p>In the main, however, we little folks and the planet aren't doing so well on the national and international levels. Not a single emerging or industrialized country in the world yet has a rational, workable, well-thought-out energy policy. Of the few governments now paying lip service to the sun (which, after all and for all practical purposes, does supply every bit of energy we use), most are stupidly and corruptly locked into developmental programs designed to put control of this widely decentralized source of energy into the hands of a few multi-national corporations. Or into the hands of one or two of their own government agencies.</p><p>But life doesn't <em>have</em> to be that way! It doesn't <em>have</em> to be what Big Government, Big Business, and Big Labor seem so determined to make it. Who needs a regimented, planet-raping existence dictated by Big This, That, or The Other anyway? Especially when it's still possible for small groups of people, one lone family, even a single individual . . . to take life into his or her own hands, bust out of the mold that "they" want all of us to stay in, and-with a little hard work-build and enjoy an earth-oriented way of living for him or herself.</p><p>How do we know? Because-since founding this publication-we've received not hundreds, not thousands, not tens of thousands . . . but <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of letters filled with more or less the theme that you see in AI Lampo's letter over there on the facing page. See. If you're still wondering, it <em>can</em> be done.</p><p>Even though Al gives this magazine a great deal of credit for the relatively low-energy-consumption and high-planetary-awareness life that he now leads . . . we've chosen to run his letter for an entirely different reason: Al can think for himself and he's not afraid to roll up his sleeves and work a little to put his ideals into practice. He may well have gotten some inspiration and worthwhile how-to information from our pages, as he says . . . but MOTHER has never featured taxidermy in her home business articles, nor has she ever devoted space to reasoning out the merits of hunting versus not hunting in quite the way that AI has done. Mr. Lampo did all that for himself, and we admire him for it. Especially since we can't disagree in any way with his conclusions or the manner in which he's chosen to live.</p><p>And yet . . . and yet . . . even though there are now hundreds of thousands of Al Lampos in the world . . . there are still hundreds of <em>millions</em> of others "out there" who haven't yet reached Al's-or your or my-level of environmental awareness. And the regimentation of little people and the rape of the planet not only continues . . . but accelerates daily. We don't have much time left to make the changes in our society that simply <em>must</em> be made if you and your children and your children's children are to live lives of real satisfaction and freedom . . . . . . . . . and if the planet is to endure.</p><p>And that's why-after eight full years of publishing a magazine dedicated to [a] helping all the little people in the world realize the age-old dream of independent self-determination and [b] at the same time helping to make it possible for us all to grope our way toward less energy-intensive and more earth-oriented ways of life-we're still at the same old stand serving up the same kind of publication we started out to print back in the summer of '69.</p><p>Oh yes. MOTHER has changed over the years. She now contains from 180 to 204 pages per issue, instead of the skinny 64 we started with. And we now put a foldout in each magazine and some color, and some of our paper is better than it used to be, and we now print more firsthand reports and fewer reprints from other sources, and we have more experiments from our own labs to feature, and we've financed a great many of these improvements with advertising revenue . . . and some of you old-time MOTHER readers write in ever so often to ask why.</p><p>And the reason is that such upgrading really does work. Maybe you don't need to see sharper photos in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) to convince you to read the magazine . . . but it seems that a lot of other people do. Because every time we crank in such an improvement, our circulation jumps. Every time we improve the appearance of the publication, in short, we find ourselves reaching more people with MOTHER's message . . . and that's what we're here for.</p><p>And that's why-after eight years of grinding out MOTHERS-we're finally ready to take our . . . last big step up. This is the year, we hope, that we'll finally be able to establish a core of field editors to send us natural gardening, wild food, alternative energy, low-cost construction, and home business reports on an up-to-the-minute-here's-what's-happening-in-my-region basis. And begin building the prototype self-sufficient "constructed from waste" house that we've been developing for four years and which we want to feature in this magazine just as soon as possible. And a great many other things that we've been striving toward for eight long years.</p><p>And yes, just like everyone else, all our costs have been going up substantially (we've been hit with paper price increases, alone, of 31 % during the past 12 months), and we're barely holding our own now, and we're facing more increases in the cost of publishing this magazine, and all these projected improvements are going to cost too, and we are going to raise the price of this publication.</p><p>But we think it's all going to be worth it and, if you'll turn to pages 66 and 67 of this issue, you'll see that we're giving you plenty of opportunity to enter as many new subscriptions as you like and/or extend your current subscription or subscriptions (yes, some people have several) to MOTHER for as long as you like (even a lifetime) before the increase goes into effect.</p><p>So here we go on the next eight years. The world in general may be a lot more tattered and torn than it was when we began assembling our first MOTHER in the summer of 1969 . . . but we know for a fact that there are now several hundred thousand Al Lampos in the world who feel that THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) has helped them find a way to realize their dreams of self-reliance and environmentally oriented living.</p><p>Now all we have to do is keep on working . . . until we (and that includes <em>you</em> ) have turned that "several hundred thousand" . . . into several hundred million. Let's get on with it.</p>
