                        <p>      <strong>"Men and women needed to whitewash barns. Flexible      hours, opportunity to meet farmers, income of $900 per      month possible. No experience necessary." Chances are, you      won't come across an ad like this in the classified section      of your Sunday paper . . . but the job</strong>      <strong><em>does</em> exist, and you can fill it.      Here-to tell you how-is Loran T.      Lentz.</strong><br />    </p>        <p>      Altogether, there are probably about 9,993 ways to make      money in the country. My way, though, has to be one of the      simplest and most rewarding (in every sense of the word) of      all. I whitewash barns.    </p>    <p>      Here in Wisconsin (and-I suspect-in many other      states as well), dairy farmers are required to either      whitewash their barns on the inside every year or repaint      them. (Alternately the walls and ceilings may be      steam-cleaned on a frequent basis, but that gets to be      expensive.) Because whitewash costs so much less than      paint, most dairymen opt to have their barns<br />      sprayed by a local whitewasher. And that's I come in.<br />    </p>    <p>      Three years ago, you see, my partner John; and I each put      up about $200 in cash to buy [1] an old whitewashing      machine, [2] a new portable barn blower, and [3] a few      sacks of whitewash. Wthin weeks, our shoestring      enterprise-Tom Sawyer Whitewashing and Barn      Cleaning-had earned enough money to pay back our      initial investment . . . and by the end of our first      summer, John and I had built our <em>individual</em>      monthly incomes to nearly $900!    </p>    <p>      We can't guarantee that, you'll be as successful with your      own whitewash operation. I <em>can</em> guarantee this,      however: After reading the following story you'll be a lot      better prepared to start a successful whitewash business      than John and I were when we first began!    </p>    <h3>WHAT <em>IS</em> WHITEWASHING,      ANYWAY?</h3>    <p>      You probably know what whitewashing is if you grew up on a      farm and can remember the yearly visits of the whitewasher,      whose job it was to chase the spiders out of the barn and      make the inside of the building look good as new again. In      case you <em>don't</em> know what it is, however,      whitewashing is simply an age-old, low-cost way of      <em>beautifying</em> and <em>sanitizing</em> fences.      outbuildings, and other structures that often need to be      beautified and sanitized.    </p>    <p>      Until not many years ago, the principal ingredient of most      whitewashes vas lime (calcium oxide) . . . which is still      used that way by many folks. Unfortunately, lime has one      serious drawback: It's highly corrosive. Which means it's      harmful to machinery, bad for animals (calves, lick      everything around them, including whitewashed walls), and      irritating to the skin and lungs of the person spraying      it.<br />    </p>    <p>      Nowadays, you can buy several commercial brands of      <em>clay-based</em> whitewash. These products are a bit      more expensive than lime (the kind we use-Voco      II-costs about $4.00 per 50-pound sack versus $S3.00      or so for the same amount of lime), but are non-corrosive      and don't become brittle and flaky with age the way lime      does. (Check with feed stores and farm supply, outlets in      your area to see what kinds of whitewashes are available      and at what prices.)    </p>    <h3>TOOLS OF THE TRADE</h3>    <p>      The first piece of equipment IN you'll need is a whitewash      machine see photo) . . . an apparatus consisting of a      mixing tank, a pumping barrel, a pump, a high-pressure hose      (with spray gun), and a gasoline engine or electric motor      to run everything. If you're industrious, you can assemble      y our own machine from individual components. (Hint: A      55-gallon drum makes a great' mixing tank.) Otherwise, you      can buy your rig pre-assembled, either new or used.    </p>    <p>      New machines (many of which are mounted on skids so they      can be loaded easily into the back of a pickup can be      purchased at some farm implement dealers. (Also look under      "Spraying Equipment" in the Yellow Pages.) New, such a rig      runs from $600 to well over $1,000.    </p>    <p>      You can save quite a bundle, of course, if you're willing      to take the time to scout out used equipment. (Check with      farmers, feed stores, and local creameries for leads in      tracking down "previously owned" machines.) We spent $200      for our first sprayer, a do-it-yourself job built sometime      in the 50's and mounted on a trailer. Then, a couple of      years later, we bought a two-year-old machine mounted on      skids for only $90. Both were pretty good buys, though, so      be prepared to pay more for your <em>rig</em> .    </p>    <p>      Another useful (though not essential) piece of equipment to      have is a high-velocity air blower that you can use to rid      walls and ceilings of loose hay, dust, cobwebs, and old,      flaky whitewash. Our "duster"-a Voco Mini Barn      Blower-blasts out air with a nozzle tip speed of 550      mph, is light enough to carry around on one shoulder, and      cost us about $170. (If you're so inclined, you may be able      to piece together your own inexpensive blower. We heard of      one old-timer who rigged up an air compressor powered by a      Model A Ford engine. All he had to do was drag an air hose      through the barn, instead of carrying the whole apparatus      around with him.)    </p>    <p>      Why should you even bother to clean a barn in the first      place? Number one, you'll find you can do a much better      whitewash job on a surface that's free of dirt and debris.      Number two, you can (rightfully) charge more money for      performing this added service. And number three, because of      the extra work involved you can schedule fewer barns per      day and spend more time in one geographical area.    </p>    <p>      Of course, before you hit the road you'll want to stock up      on whitewash. Take three or four bags of dry mix with you      on every outing, and try not to stray too far from a farm      supply store or other establishment that carries the kind      of whitewash you like to use.    </p>    <p>      One more thing: Whitewash belongs on the barn, not in your      lungs . . . <em>so wear a mask</em> . (John and I found the      disposable 3M masks worn by auto body shop workers to be      the most satisfactory.) Also, a broad-brimmed      hat-such as Tom Sawyer himself might have      worn-will do wonders for keeping flecks of old lime      out of your eyes (and spiders off your neck).    </p>    <h3>GET THE WORD OUT</h3>    <p>      Once you're ready to begin spraying, you gotta let farmers      know about it. The classified section of the local      newspaper (or shoppers' tabloid) is fine for a start and      will probably bring you enough work at first to pay off      your equipment . . . but by far the best way to generate      business is to [1] compile a list of all the dairymen in      your area (or wherever you're willing to travel to work),      and [2] write to or visit the farmers. (When we were just      starting, John and I would've paid      $1,000-gladly-for the file of names we now      have.)    </p>    <p>      How can you obtain the names and addresses of local      dairymen? Check with the nearest creamery. Most      creameries-it turns out-are happy to give you a      copy of their milk truck itinerary (which has the      information you need) . . . for the simple reason that if      the farms on that list don't pass inspection (due to      unsanitary barn conditions) the creameries themselves      either lose money or are shut down. Creameries and milk      inspectors, in other words, are natural allies of the      whitewasher. (Note: One advantage of getting names from a      milk truck schedule is that the farms are already grouped      by geographical location.)    </p>    <p>      Another thing you'll want to do is <em>have business cards      printed.</em> We asked creameries to mail ours out in their      monthly milk check mailings (which they did). The cards      also came in handy when we ran into the state milk      inspector at a farm one day. (The man took a stack of our      cards, and-from then on-whenever he came across      an unsanitary barn, he left a message from Tom Sawyer!)    </p>   <h3>A SUGGESTION</h3>    <p>      Before you take on any assignments, whitewash a friend's      barn for free (or for the cost of materials), just to get      the hang of things. One barn can teach you a lot about      whitewashing . . . enough-at least-so that when      your first "real" job comes along, you won't look too      klutzy to a skeptical farmer. (Remember: A dairyman and his      family spend hours every day in their barn. It's important      to <em>them</em> that the job be done right . . . and it's      important to you, because a reputation for quality work in      farm country sure makes life easier.)    </p>    <h3>BARN-CLEANING TIPS</h3>    <p>      If you're going to clean a barn before you spray it, you'll      find the job goes a little faster and easier if you:[1]      Open all windows and doors and turn on exhaust fans. [2]      Always walk backwards. (It helps keep dust and grit from      falling all over you.) [3] Have an assistant go ahead of      you with a broom, if cobwebs are particularly plentiful.      [4] <em>Wear a mask and a hat.</em>    </p>    <h3>ASK WHAT TO SPRAY</h3>    <p>      If you want to be loved and get repeat business, find      out- <em>before</em> you begin-exactly what the      farmer wants sprayed and what he doesn't want sprayed. One      whitewasher we knew sprayed anything and      everything-animals, telephones, medicines, you name      it-whether it moved or not. We got a lot of his      business.    </p>    <p>      You'll find that some farmers are very particular and will      have everything they don't want sprayed covered and ready      to go as soon as you arrive. Others, however, won't do any      such "setup" work for you. In the latter case, it's your      responsibility to cover any items that the farmer says      aren't to be whitewashed . . . with the exception of the      milk pipeline. (Covering the pipeline just takes too      doggoned long . . . and besides, it's usually in need of a      good scrubbing anyway!)    </p>    <p>      Be sure to ask about windows. Some farmers want 'em      sprayed, since they believe it'll help keep the barn cooler      in summer. (Clay-based whitewash washes off easily with      warm water and vinegar in the fall.) Others don't want      their windows sprayed (perhaps because the panes are ready      to fall out). We charge 20 cents per pane to cover windows      with newspaper, although we try to be flexible on this      during price negotiations.    </p>    <h3>MIXING THE WHITEWASH</h3>    <p>      Voco II is a fine powder and will form lumps if you add it      too rapidly to water. What we do is adjust a garden hose      nozzle to give a hard spray and gradually add the powder to      the mixing tank in the turbulence created by the spray . .      . rather than fill the tank with 16 gallons of water      (enough to dissolve 50 pounds of whitewash) first, then      depend on the paddles in the tank to agitate the water      sufficiently.    </p>    <p>      We use hot water (from the milk-house) for mixing if we're      going to be spraying a closed or plywood ceiling, an open      ceiling made with finished lumber, a new ceiling of any      type, or a previously painted ceiling. Cold water can be      used, but hot whitewash seems to adhere better to smooth      surfaces.    </p>    <p>      If you wish to make a lime-based whitewash, you can do so      as follows: First, soak 50 pounds of hydrated lime in six      gallons of water until you've got a paste. Then dissolve      six pounds of salt in three gallons of boiling water, allow      the mixture to cool, and add the brine to the (roughly)      eight gallons of lime paste. Finally, stir in three pounds      of white portland cement.    </p>    <p>      Try to mix up enough whitewash at the outset to last you      through the job at hand. (This takes experience, of course      . . . but as a rough rule of thumb, you can figure that a      gallon of whitewash will cover about 250 to 300 square feet      of wall space.)<br />    </p>    <p>      This is the point at which you add insecticides to the      whitewash if the farmer asks you to do so and you foolishly      agree. We dumped bug-killer into the Voco (at cost) during      our first year, as a service to our customers (despite the      fact that the darned stuff is expensive and doesn't last      more than a few weeks anyway). The day I      staggered-dizzy-out of the barn after spraying      poison for half an hour, however, I decided, "Hey, this is      no good . . . no way!" and we never sprayed chemicals      again.    </p>    <p>      I might add that we have yet to lose a job due to our      refusal to use poisons. If a farmer really wants      chlorinated hydrocarbons in his barn, it's cheaper for      <em>him</em> to apply them with a hand sprayer after the      whitewash has dried. (The read key to holding a barn's      insect population down-as any good farmer      knows-is to keep the building manure free inside AND      out.)    </p>   <h3>ACTUALLY DOING IT</h3>    <p>      When you're ready to begin, close all windows and doors and      turn off any fans that might be running in the building . .      . then unwind the hose from your machine and stretch it out      to the farthest corner of the barn. Start the pump motor      and let the pressure build to around 200 pounds per square      inch. (Note: If you're spraying lime, you'll probably have      to go to 300 psi, which will-in turn-put      considerably more strain on your equipment. Still another      reason to stick with clay based whitewash.) The tip of your      spray gun should have a No. 4 (1/16" diameter) disc in it      for a clay-based wash, and you should have a bucket of      water nearby for washing the tip, should it become clogged      with foreign particles.    </p>    <p>      This is it! Now just [1] turn the handle on the gun, [2]      adjust the spray, and [3] start walking backwards around      the barn (the way you did when you were cleaning the walls      with the blower), striving-at the same time-to      avoid manure-filled gutters. (There's usually one such      ditch at the far end of the barn. Naturally, knee-high      boots are a great help until you've developed a sixth sense      about where you're going.)    </p>    <p>      Don't worry about your technique: There's no "right" way to      spray a barn. Just hit whatever needs hitting (don't forget      the wood between the ceiling joists), and try to develop a      system of some kind so that you do each barn pretty much      the same way. If you're using Voco II-which goes on      clear and then turns white <em>after it</em> <em>dries</em>      -be particularly thorough.    </p>    <p>      Barns that are exceptionally dirty and flaky and rife with      flyspecks and manure may need a couple of coats of wash to      look good again. Generally, though, one good coat will do      the trick.    </p>    <h3>LIVING WITH YOUR MACHINE</h3>    <p>      It's easy to develop a love/hate relationship with a      whitewash machine. Even at a low 200 pounds of pressure,      the pump works mighty hard and breakdowns are not uncommon.      Whether these malfunctions turn out to be minor annoyances      or major disasters, however, depends largely on what      precautions you take. To put it differently: It pays to      keep a supply of easily worn-out parts (such as valves,      springs, balls and seats, etc.) on hand at all times. The      availability or non-availability of a $1.98 part at a      critical time can mean the difference between a few      <em>minutes</em> delay as you install the spare part, and a      two- to three- <em>week</em> wait for the factory-fresh      replacement.    </p>    <p>      When the pressure drops while you're spraying, it's usually      either because [1] the mixing barrel is low on whitewash,      or [2] a filter (in the mixing tank or in the pump) is      clogged. Other kinds of malfunctions are possible, too,      depending on the particular type of pump you have.    </p>    <p>      Some things, unfortunately, can only be learned through      harsh experience. There is one thing you can do to help      minimize the "breakdown blues", though, and that's simply      to take the time at the end of each working day to [1]      rinse the mixing tank thoroughly and [2] pump clean water      through the hose until the liquid comes out clear.    </p>    <h3>THE WHITEWASHING LIFE</h3>    <p>      Here in northern Wisconsin, the whitewashing season starts      when the farmers turn their cows out to spring pasture and      lasts until so late in the fall that the spray hose freezes      up faster than you can thaw it out. During the "on" months,      it's possible to work as much-or as little-as      you like, <em>when</em> you like. You're truly your own      boss.    </p>    <p>      John and I have "barnstormed" the hinter regions of      northern Wisconsin and Minnesota for weeks at a time in the      summer, whitewashing during the day and camping out every      night. In our travels we've met young farmers trying hard      to make it with 80 cows, and old-timers who've learned to      do well with only 20 milkers. We've learned the backroads      (in some parts) better than anyone save the milk truck      drivers themselves. On occasion, too, we've been treated to      a delicious homecooked meal at the end of the day as extra      payment for a job well done.    </p>    <p>      Whitewashing has worked for us, even in the northernmost      reaches of Wisconsin, where barns are few and      farming-in general-is a marginal enterprise. If      you live anywhere near farm country-and you're      looking for a job that offers flexible hours,      more-than-reasonable pay, opportunity to travel and meet      people, and a chance to perform a needed      service-whitewashing may work for you, too.    </p>    <h3>HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU CHARGE?</h3>    <p>      Once you begin to look at barns from the <em>inside</em> ,      you'll be amazed at how they differ. (Clearly, there's no      such thing as a "typical" or "average" barn.) Yet, somehow,      the whitewasher must come up with a pricing formula that's      flexible enough to accommodate all the idiosyncracies of      each barn he/she is likely to encounter.    </p>    <p>      My partner and I have found the answer to this problem (we      think): We've developed a sliding scale that's based      primarily-but not solely-on a barn's floor      area. Our system allows us to spray a larger barn for less      money per square foot than a smaller barn (which is only      fair, since certain costs-those connected with travel      and setup time, for instance-are constant regardless      of the size of the job) . . . and still make a fair profit.    </p>    <p>      Here's our "magic formula":    </p>    <p>      Price = Floor Area (in square feet) X $0.01 + Increment    </p>    <p>      The "increment" varies with the size of the barn, as      follows:    </p>		    <p>      Let's say, for example, that you're asked to whitewash a      barn with inside dimensions of 34' X 80' (which represents      a floor area of 2,720 feet). Your estimate-according to the      above formula-is 2,720 times $0.01 plus $24 . . . or $27.20      plus $24, which equals $51.20.    </p>    <p>      After we've determined our initial cost estimate, we deduct      15% if the barn has a closed ceiling. (If, however, the      building has wooden stanchions and calf pens, we tack on an      extra $5.00 for barns less than 70 feet long and $10 if the      barn's longer than 70 feet.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, we charge a flat rate of 1.1 cents per square      foot to clean a barn (with a 15% deduction, again, for a      closed ceiling).    </p>    <p>      Note: Our pricing formula is based on a price of about      $4.00 per 50-Ib. bag of claybased whitewash. If whitewash      costs substantially more where you live, you may have to      adjust your cost estimates upwards accordingly.    </p>    <p>      In any case, if you start out using the pricing formula      shown above, at least you won't be underbidding your first      jobs as much as my partner and I did when <em>we</em> first      began our business!-LL.    </p>
