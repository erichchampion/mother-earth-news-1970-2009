                  <p>      If you now operate-or have <em>ever</em>      operated-a successful home business that was inspired      by an article you read in MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or      less) when and where-and with how much "seed      money"-you started your venture. If your story can be      fitted into an upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP      BUSINESSES, you'll receive [1] the warm satisfaction of      knowing that you helped someone else find the happiness you      enjoy <em>and</em> [2] a free <em>two-year</em> new or      renewal subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .    </p>    <p>      Back in early 1971, some would-be back-to-the-landers in      Quincy, Illinois who were looking for a moneymaking scheme      happened upon an article in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted)      about selling lemonade.    </p>    <p>      The write-up, "An Ideal Way for a Commune to Make Heavy      Bread" (MOTHER NO. 3, pages 28 and 29) motivated one of      these folks-Kent Kattelman-to build a portable      8' X 8' stand of plywood and 2 X 4's. <em>(See, too, "The      Lemon Tree", Issue No. 15, pages 29 through 31.-</em>      <em>MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      The lower four feet of the walls in Kent's movable booth      are plywood, and screening runs from the wood on up to the      stand's roof. There's a counter in the front for      transactions, and one in the rear to hold all necessary      paraphernalia. Such a stand, put together wholly with      screws and bolts, can be knocked down by two people in half      an hour . . . and fits piecemeal into an eight-foot pickup      bed.    </p>    <p>      During the summer of '71, Kent-with his wife Michelle      and friends Rod Pool and Jeff Walz-sold lemonade at      the local county fair and at several smaller festivals, and      found the enterprise quite profitable indeed.    </p>    <p>      I entered the scene that fall, when we all talked of buying      a farm and establishing a tiny community (we were five      adults and one child at that time). And how did we figure      on financing our dream? With lemonade!    </p>    <p>      Our initial expenses were minimal: The stand had cost about      $150 to construct, and the additional equipment we bought      came to only $100.    </p>    <p>      The business has now flourished for six seasons, and each      year of added "seniority" has enhanced our standing with      both fair officials and thirsty patrons.    </p>    <p>      We follow a kind of assembly line procedure for washing,      quartering, and squeezing the lemons, measuring the sugar      and water, etc., which culminates when one of us hands a      buyer his or her iced beverage in a 16-ounce disposable      tumbler.    </p>    <p>      While we need six workers during rush hours, three can      handle the operation for an average flow of people. The      entire process is entertaining to watch, and we add to our      customers' fun (and our own) by maintaining a steady stream      of friendly chatter.    </p>    <p>      In our first two years, we made sufficient profits to pay      for a 40-acre farm here in Missouri, and we've since used      our lemonade income to finance the buildings on our land.    </p>    <p>      Need I say how grateful we are for the idea that started it      all?    </p>    <p>      Susan Landfield<br />      Newark, Mo.    </p>    <p>      Two years ago I bought a Troy-Bilt tiller, and last      spring-being short on cash-I decided to follow      up on your article about the rototilling business (MOTHER      NO. 32, pages 90 through 92).    </p>    <p>      Since I already owned the tiller and a pickup, my seed      money amounted to $20 for a month of newspaper ads and a      few dollars for gas. I scrounged the lumber to make a      loading ramp, and after things got rolling I invested $5.00      to have 100 posters printed . . . and maybe another dollar      for the gas I used in posting them.    </p>    <p>      My advertisements drew an amazing response, and I soon      learned to make sure I had someone at home to answer all      the phone calls that came in while I was out working.    </p>    <p>      In my first season, I made more than enough to pay for the      tiller, <em>and</em> to cover expenses on my truck (which      were considerable, since it almost gave up the ghost on      several occasions).    </p>    <p>      The work was enjoyable, even though I was frequently      hassled by people who felt women aren't suited for such      labor. I just laughed these remarks off in a friendly way .      . . and never failed to pick up even more jobs in that      neighborhood from onlookers who approved of my attitude.    </p>    <p>      This season I expect to bring in <em>more</em> business,      since I plan-in addition to my ads-to send all      last year's customers a note requesting early reservations.    </p>    <p>      Rototilling might not support you year round, but a single      month's work can sure make a dent in your bills (one      operator of a tilling service in this area made over $1,500      last spring) . . . and can expose you to some great people      in the process!    </p>    <p>      Sue Gregg<br />      Burlington, Vt.    </p>    <p>      It seems like I've <em>always</em> wanted to start a      business of my own, but there were always two problems: [1]      My wife and I barely made enough money to pay our bills,      let alone invest in an independent business venture, and      [2] though I'd worked at many different occupations, I'd      never stayed long enough with any one of them to become a      professional.    </p>    <p>      Then-a couple weeks ago, after the cattle rancher for      whom I was working laid me off-I happened to read      Glen R. Smith's article about the firewood business in      MOTHER NO. 41.    </p>    <p>      Glen's line of work sounded mighty good to me, since I      already owned a good professional type chain saw and had      lots of experience laying down and bucking up trees for      firewood. Unfortunately, though, I couldn't afford to buy      the other necessary equipment Glen talked about: namely, a      truck or trailer for hauling wood, and a powered log      splitter.    </p>    <p>      After talking the whole thing over, my wife and I became so      excited at the prospect of being our own bosses that I came      up with a way to go into business <em>despite</em> our lack      of capital. "Why not cut people's firewood for them," I      asked my mate, "right on their own land? We won't make as      much per cord as we would if we were selling the logs AND      the labor, but it <em>will</em> be a way to get started in      the business!"    </p>    <p>      After investing $20 in a splitting maul (the only      "necessary item" I didn't already have), I began to      advertise my services . . . and quickly discovered that      there are plenty of people here-abouts who won't pay $60      per cord for someone else's wood, but who'll gladly pay us      to come and cut fuel on their lots.    </p>    <p>      My whole family gets in the act: We drive to our customers'      place, our "employers" show us which trees to cut, I lay      the trees down, and my wife and I take turns cutting them      into stove-length pieces. While one of us is handling the      chain saw, the other one piles the logs, and our children      (under our close guidance) pull the brush out of the way as      it's shaved off the tree.    </p>    <p>      Then, depending on the terrain and weather, I either split      the wood on the spot or take it to where it's to be stored      and cleave it there. Since I have no pickup truck, my      clients often let me use theirs if they have one.      Otherwise, my station wagon does the job.    </p>    <p>      The payment for this work is always negotiable. (I like to      settle on a price that makes both parties happy.)    </p>    <p>      It's good, honest, outdoor work, and-while it'll never make      us rich-it's a living. I figure that by summer I'll      be able to buy both a truck and a splitter. Then-with      these essentials-I can start selling wood as well as      work!    </p>    <p>      Terry Crist<br />      Catheys Valley, Calif.    </p>
