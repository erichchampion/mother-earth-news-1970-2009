                    <p>      <strong>GARY SKEEM TAKES ENERGY SELF-RELIANCE      SERIOUSLY:</strong> Skeem-a resident of McCammon,      Idaho-heats and operates his house with electricity      generated by a low-head, 25,000-watt hydroelectric plant      that he built and installed himself. (In addition, he uses      DC "juice" from a windplant to power some items in his      house and outbuildings.) Utah Power & Light      disconnected Skeem's service a while back when he refused      to pay UP&L a $30 monthly "standby fee" . . . but Skeem      doesn't seem to mind. In fact, he's now going ahead with      plans to build a third electrical generating plant, which      he says he'll use to operate a greenhouse and produce      hydrogen (by electrolysis of water) to power his vehicles.      Gary Skeem on energy self-sufficiency: "If you think you      can't, you can't . . . but if you think you can, you can."    </p>    <p>      <strong>RAIL RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS MAY WASTE (RATHER THAN      SAVE) ENERGY</strong> , according to University of      California economist Charles A. Lave, who points out that      while buses require only 2,900 Btu's of energy per      passenger mile, San Francisco's BART trains consume some      4,610 Btu's per passenger mile. Says Lave: "It will even      pay to shut down the existing [BART] rail system, once the      Congressionally mandated improvement in auto fuel      efficiency becomes effective." (Congress has decreed      that-in the future-autos must use the      equivalent of only 3,940 Btu's per seat mile.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>MANDATORY INSULATION?</strong> Federal Energy      Administrator John F. O'Leary says that he's looking at      legislation that would require utility companies to      insulate private homes and bill the homeowners for the      improvement, according to a report in High Country News      ($12/25 issues from Box K, Lander, Wyo. 82520). "We're      going to have to find some way . . . to go back into all      the buildings and all the houses that have been built, to      bring them up to a minimum standard of energy efficiency,"      O'Leary is quoted as saying. "I don't think we can do that      through voluntarism."    </p>    <p>      <strong>WASTE STORAGE ISSUE BRINGS WEST GERMANY'S NUCLEAR      PLANS TO A HALT</strong> . In mid-February, a court in the      German state of Schleswig-Holstein ruled that construction      of a nuclear plant in that state could not go forward until      a clear national policy for waste disposal had been worked      out. Because of this-and because of widespread      anti-nuclear sentiment throughout West Germany-the      Schmidt government has decided (according to a report in      Science ) to bring all nuclear construction in the country      to a halt until the waste disposal problem has been      settled.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT MAY BE THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST "GARBAGE-TO-GAS"      CONVERSION FACILITY</strong> is presently under      construction in Pompano Beach, Florida. When finished later      this year, the $2.8 million plant is expected to produce      6,000 cubic feet of combustible methane gas per day from a      daily input of 100 tons of sewage and other wastes. "If      this experiment succeeds," Governor Reubin Askew told a      ground-breaking-ceremony crowd, "it could make it possible      to reduce the volume of municipal waste by 70 percent and      [at the same time] produce quality methane for direct      consumer use."    </p>    <p>      <strong>CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME THE FIRST STATE</strong> to      adopt minimum energy-efficiency standards for household      appliances. As of October 1977 all refrigerators, freezers,      and room air conditioners sold in California must meet      specifications set by the state Energy Commission. The new      standards are expected to result in a net annual savings of      2.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity . . . which is      roughly equivalent to the total yearly power output of      California's San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station near San      Clemente.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PHONE COMPANY TAPS WIND POWER</strong> . The New      England Telephone Company on Block Island, Rhode Island has      begun using electricity generated by a wind turbine. The      windplant-built by the Zephyr Wind Dynamo Co. of      Brunswick, Maine-is expected to produce 22,000      kilowatt-hours of electricity per year . . . a substantial      portion of the phone company's needs. (Excess "juice" will      reportedly be turned over to the Block Island Power Co.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>A COUPLE THOUSAND USED</strong> <strong>BEVERAGE      CANS-SOME BLACK PAINT</strong> , and about $250 worth of      aluminum foil, glazing, and insulation . . . that's all you      need to convert the south wall of your house into a giant,      60%-efficient air-handling solar collector, according to      the good folks at the Northern Solar Power Co., 311 Elm St.      South, Moorhead, Minn. 56560. If you don't believe it (or      even if you do), send the Northern Solar Power people      $2.00, and-in turn-they'll send you a detailed,      crisply written Construction Manual telling you how it's      done.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TALK ABOUT "HOT" GOODS</strong> : Among $24,000      worth of loot stolen from a parked truck in Labadieville,      Louisiana earlier this year were <strong>TWO CANISTERS OF      RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL</strong> , still unrecovered. (And      nuclear industry spokesmen say the public needn't worry      about radioactive elements getting into the wrong hands.) .      . . . Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has      ordered all U.S. atomic power plants to hire additional      guards install surveillance gear, and take other new      <strong>MEASURES TO THWART ARMED SABOTAGE</strong> .      Estimated cost per plant: $2 million . . . . The Energy      Research and Development Administration wants to spend      $400,000 helping homeowners, builders, and engineers      develop new designs for <strong>PASSIVE AND HYBRID SOLAR      HEATING SYSTEMS</strong> (i.e., systems that employ few or      no automatic controls, fans, or pumps). To get in on the      action, write the ERDA in Washington, D.C. 20545 and ask      for Program Research and Development Announcement      EG-77-D-29-005 . . . . Shell Oil Company's plans to drill      for 280 million barrels of oil near Cortez, Colorado may      imperil 3,000 <strong>SENSITIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL      SITES</strong> (Anasazi Indian ruins) in the area. Shell      says, however, that it won't give the project the final      go-ahead until feasibility studies are complete in 1980 . .      . . The folks at Dodge Products, Box 19781, Houston, Tex.      77024 have developed (and are now marketing) a      <strong>HAND-HELD SOLAR METER</strong> capable of measuring      the intensity of incident sunlight with a degree of      accuracy paralleling that of expensive laboratory      pyranometers. Price of the DP Model 776 Portable Solar      Meter is $49.50, FOB Houston.    </p>
