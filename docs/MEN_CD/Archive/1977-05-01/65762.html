                    <p>      This article reprinted by permission from <em>Popular      Mechanics.</em> Copyright Â© 1946, The Hearst      Corporation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>If you've never heard of Hi Sibley, you should      have. Because back in the mid40's Hi was living-and writing      about-more of a MOTHER-type life than most MOTHER      readers live today. Do-ity-ourself adobe houses, "organic"      gardening, homestead bees, and a hundred other back-to.      basics projects . . . ole Hi and his wife did 'em      themselves and then published the results of their work in      a good dozen magazines of the day. The following Hi Sibley      article originally appeared in a 1946 issue of Popular      Mechanics ... but it's just as timely and valuable to any      self-reliant home. steading family now as it was      then.</strong>    </p>        <p>      That's right! 100 blocks per hour . . . provided you have      the help and the space and racks to cure the blocks      properly. In Fig. 1 you see the outfit complete, ready for      work. It's a self-contained unit mounted on its own      two-wheeled, pneumatictired trailer with a supporting      caster wheel under the drawbar. There's nothing to take      apart and put together again when you move the machine.      Merely disconnect the water hose and the power line, hitch      it to a truck, and away you go.    </p>    <p>      Figs. 4 to 7 inclusive show how it works. Fig. 2 details      the metal mold and Fig. 3 the ejector plates and assembly.      In Fig. 4 the mold, supported by a crane, is being lowered      into place on the molding "board", in this case a steel      plate somewhat larger than the mold. In Fig. 5 the mix is      being scraped and troweled into the mold. When full the      mold is vibrated by means of a footoperated take-off drive,      and then the excess material is struck off the top with the      fence or striker board. Next, the crane is hooked to the      mold and the ejector is swung into place. In Fig. 6 the      operator bears down on the ejector and simultaneously      presses a foot pedal to raise the mold off the formed      blocks. In Fig. 7 the finished blocks are being moved to      the curing racks.    </p>        <p>      Fig. 8 shows the main frame, entirely a welded job using 3-      and 4-inch pipe, steel plate, and steel channel. Only      general dimensions are given as some of these parts must be      sized to fit during the assembly of other parts of the      machine. With the exception of the motor, which is only a      representation, the crosshatched views in Fig. 9 are      intended to give a general guide to proportionate sizes of      the machine parts and their relative positions. To make the      manner of assembly more clear, certain parts have been      omitted from these details. No detailed dimensions have      been given in Fig. 9 because these will vary somewhat      according to the materials and parts which you have or      which are available.    </p>    <p>      Figs. 10 to 15 inclusive show the assembly. From these      details you will see first that the main drive from the      motor to the mixing chamber is made from a Ford Model-A      rear axle and drive shaft, (Fig. 11). One axle housing is      removed and the open end of the differential housing is      covered with a sheet-metal disk bolted on with a gasket      between to prevent leakage of lubricant. A roller-chain      drive sprocket is welded or keyed to the axle and a      two-step V-pulley is attached to the drive shaft. The drive      thus formed from this unit is welded to the trailer frame      at three points: at the end of the Model-A axle housing      where it passes through a hole in the mixing-drum bracket,      and at the differential and the forward end of the      drive-shaft housing, where it also is supported on      brackets.    </p>    <p>      The hopper, Fig. 10, and the mixing drum are made of heavy      sheet metal welded at all joints and reinforced with steel      angles welded on as stiffeners wherever large areas of the      metal are subjected to severe strain. The steel mixing      blades of the agitator, Fig. 9, the top view, have a      clearance of about 3 inches inside the drum.    </p>    <p>      Figs. 13 and 14 and the two upper views in Fig. 11 detail      the crane and ejector arm. The crane is an allwelded      assembly of standard rod and pipe sizes and is operated by      a pedal which extends underneath the machine. However, the      ejector mechanism is a somewhat more intricate affair. The      ejector plates must raise and lower in the same plane,      making two pairs of adjustable parallel arms necessary. A      "helper" spring eases the lift of the assembly and another      coil spring swings it to one side. Bearings at both ends of      the four arms should fit accurately. Fig. 11 shows the      frame which supports the crane and ejector.    </p>    <p>      The hopper is raised for dumping by a hydraulic cylinder,      Fig. 11. Arrangement of the hydraulic system is shown in      Fig. 12 and the drive to both the hydraulic pump and the      mixer is detailed in Fig. 15. Raising and lowering of the      hopper is controlled by a three-way valve, Figs. 11 and 12.      By-passing the hydraulic fluid allows the pump to be      operated continuously, thereby simplifying the drive. The      vibrator shaft, Fig. 15, is pedal-operated and runs only      when the pedal is depressed. One belt from the two-step      cone pulley passes around an idler. The pulley driving the      vibrator is located between the driving pulley and the      idler as shown in Fig. 15. When the pedal is depressed the      center pulley engages the belt, and "throw" of the      off-center weights, Fig. 11, vibrates the mold. The mold      must be held rigidly in place for this operation and Fig.      11-A details the quick-acting clamping device especially      made for this purpose.    </p>    <p>      The mold and the ejector, Figs. 2 and 3, are made for three      blocks. There are two cores in each compartment of the mold      and note especially that each core is vented (Fig. 2) and      tapered slightly so that it will draw easily without      breaking the edges of the block. Cores can be cast from a      rich cement-sand mixture or they can be made of heavy sheet      metal, welded. Where facilities and materials are      available, they also could be cast from aluminum.    </p>    <p>      Fig. 16, details A to E inclusive, shows a one-core mold (A      and B) which is suitable for certain special types of      blocks. Detail C supplements Fig. 6 and shows more clearly      the procedure and placement of the hands in ejecting the      block from the mold, while details D and E suggest types of      elevated tracks or rails for moving blocks away from the      machine and to the curing yard, as in Fig. 7. Curing racks      of any convenient size may be assembled from hardwood      boards, steel angles, and flanged rollers as in Fig. 16-D.      Detail E suggests one way of providing for easy handling of      the blocks from the machine to the curing racks.    </p>    <p>      General assembly views of a hand-operated machine for      making a few blocks at a time are given in Fig. 17. Here      most of the work is done by hand, only the vibrator being      motor driven. It's easy to build for either a one-, two-,      or threeblock mold. Proportions of the mix which have been      found most satisfactory are 7 parts pea gravel, 12 parts      sharp sand, 2 parts silt, and 2-1/2 parts portland cement.      The amount of water is determined by experiment as it      depends on the dampness of the aggregate.    </p>
