                   <p>      Life without running water has its disadvantages . . .      especially when autumn weather sets in and local creeks      become too chilly for cleansing dips.    </p>    <p>      And as Hoedad tree planters (see MOTHER NO. 43, page 100),      we always come home kind of "grungy" and in need of a good      scrub, too. Imagine our gratitude, then, when a fellow      homesteader (who'd just bought a place about a mile down      the road) heard of our plight and graciously offered us the      use of his shower. (Ahhh . . . . <em>hot</em> water!)    </p>    <p>      But what to offer in return? Of course! We could rototill      and expand his small garden plot, come springtime. And      that's just what we did!    </p>    <p>      Many other good swaps have resulted from our utilization of      the gifts of our local madrone trees. In the fall, the      madrones are laden with deep red berries, which we collect      and string into necklaces. The little fruits dry into firm,      colorful beads . . . and make great "tradables" at the many      craft fairs held throughout the year here.    </p>    <p>      We've traded our "nature necklaces" for a wide assortment      of lovely handmade goods: pottery, jewelry, drawings,      wooden toys . . . the possibilities are many, and it's      always fun.    </p>    <p>      But then, that goes for swapping in general!    </p>    <p>      Suzy LaMonte<br />      Days Creek, Ore.    </p>    <p>      One day last winter a neighbor of mine stopped by to visit      wearing a new flannel shirt that his sister had made him      for Christmas. I was quite interested in her handiwork,      since it's impossible to find a store-bought flannel shirt      with sleeves long enough to fit my boyfriend.    </p>    <p>      While we sat talking, this fellow mentioned how much he      liked the macrame plant hanger I had just finished making.      Right away, something told me my boyfriend was going to get      a flannel shirt.    </p>    <p>      My neighbor worked out a deal with his sister: He would      give her some help she needed in exchange for one handmade      flannel shirt. His sibling made the garment (to my      specifications, of course), and he then promptly traded it      to me for my plant hanger.    </p>    <p>      All three of us were pleased with the arrangement, and now      I hear that my neighbor's sister is eyeing his new macrame      hanger . . . and wanting to know if I need another flannel      shirt.    </p>    <p>      Margaret Higgs<br />      Indianapolis, Ind.    </p>    <p>      On our 2,000-mile hike from Georgia to Maine along the      Appalachian Trail, my wife and I learned how adaptable      swapping can be.    </p>    <p>      We found out (firsthand!) that long-distance hikers soon      tire of their repetitious and consequently unappetizing      meals, and we also discovered that barter can help to      remedy the situation. At a hikers' hostel in Hot Springs,      North Carolina, we encountered a "swap box" . . . a very      simple exchange system based on give and take.    </p>    <p>      Whatever a person didn't want or could no longer use was      placed in a large carton. These contributions included not      only every sort of on-the-trail food imaginable, but soap,      rope, books, candles, and a variety of backpacking      equipment. After "shopping" through the box, an individual      would replace what he took with whatever unwanted goodies      <em>he</em> might have.    </p>    <p>      In this way, hikers are able-at no cost-to      sample new foods, replace excess gear with more needed      commodities, and (best of all) leave behind their most      unappealing victuals . . . knowing that the foodstuffs will      probably be relished by the next swapper to come along!    </p>    <p>      We were so impressed with the system that we established a      swap box at a trail stop further north.    </p>    <p>      Friendly trade works . . . no matter where it occurs!    </p>    <p>      Scott Feierabend<br />      Baton Rouge, La.    </p>    <p>      I was born and raised in the most beautiful part of the      Louisiana bayou country, where barter is a way of life.    </p>    <p>      A <em>boucherie,</em> for example, was when several people      would bring their pigs to one fellow Cajun's house to be      slaughtered. This man would be well equipped and educated      for butchering hogs. The air would be full of friendship .      . . and tasty aromas, for the outdoor tables were soon      laden with good eatin's. In exchange for a free feast, many      folks would gather to help the butcher with some of the      chores around his place. Some got professional butchering,      and we all profited by getting good fellowship, a great      meal, and usually even some entertainment.    </p>    <p>      Now I live in North Carolina, and I'm still an active      trader. Among other things, I've many times swapped my      skill as a tree surgeon. On the whole, I've found that      people-because of the special bonds that seal a      deal-definitely enjoy tradin' more'n payin'.    </p>    <p>      J.H. Mayeux<br />      Weaverville, N.C.    </p>    <p>      My husband and I have a large garden, and we often barter      excess produce for things our place doesn't supply. Last      summer, for instance, we had a bumper crop of luscious      raspberries so we traded some of the fruit for our      neighboring friends' fresh eggs, raw milk, honey, and      firewood.    </p>    <p>      In the fall we needed apples, so a neighbor with a large      orchard let us pick several crates in exchange for some of      our vegetables, peaches, and peppermint. Then we traded      some of the apples for pears!    </p>    <p>      When we wanted manure for the garden, we located a dairy      farmer whose barnyard needed cleaning up. He said we could      have all of the organic fertilizer we could cart away at      absolutely no charge . . . and we reciprocated that      generosity by giving the farmer some of our finest      vegetables. He was pleased to receive the fresh produce and      to get his grounds tidied, and we were happy to have a      dependable source of all the good compost we wanted.    </p>    <p>      There simply isn't enough room here to list every one of      the successful swaps we've made, but before closing I will      mention one more: We trade issues of <em>Organic      Gardening</em> for THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) !    </p>    <p>      Jacqueline Sintay<br />      Forks of Salmon, Calif.    </p>    <p>      As a transplanted Yankee (from New Jersey), I've tried to      adopt the proverb, "Buy dear, use well, and make over."      Accordingly, much of what I swap comes from neighborhood      streets on refuse collection day. For example, an      astounding number of slightly worn or damaged but still      perfectly good lawn chairs and garden hoses are thrown out      by the residents of my town every year. So I collect 'em      each fall, buy plastic webbing and hose connectors at      close-out sales, then repair this otherwise-expensive      equipment and swap it for other things I want the following      spring and summer.    </p>    <p>      Then there's the story of how I got my brand-new $3.00      garden shed. My friend and I went to a      going-out-of-business sale, and the store manager offered      us two sheds and assorted odds and ends for a pittance if      we'd clear the display yard. We used my buddy's truck, and      sold or traded the sale leftovers for a garden tiller, a      lawn mower, some tools, and enough lumber and cement to      build the foundations for our sheds. Last fall, after a      season of renting out our backs with the tiller, we found      that the two sheds had cost us a total of only $6.00.    </p>    <p>      When I barter, my greatest joy isn't in saving money . . .      but in utilizing something someone else has given up on, or      in preventing my castoffs from becoming landfill.    </p>    <p>      Phil Block<br />      Newington, Conn.    </p>    <p>      Swapping can be magical: I saw it turn a 1/2-pound      miniature dachshund into a 1/2-ton pickup truck! Here's how      it happened.    </p>    <p>      I had just subjected my husband and children to a      blistering lecture, the point of which was: "We have too      many horses! We can't get <em>any</em> more! None!"    </p>    <p>      Then we went to see a man about a goat, and he asked us to      look at a mare he'd purchased cheap because her former      owners were moving. I felt perfectly safe in looking . . .      we had no money and too many horses anyway.    </p>    <p>      Before I could stop myself, I had traded one of our fat,      cute AKC dachshunds for a bony but beautiful appaloosa. The      children and their father just smirked at me, remembering      how I'd laid down the law.    </p>    <p>      We fattened that mare for about two months, until we met a      man with five young'uns and no horse. He was a mechanic,      and happened to have a nice pickup that he'd accepted in      lieu of pay for repair bills.    </p>    <p>      We drove away in the truck, he rode away on a plump, shiny      appaloosa, and both families were happy.    </p>    <p>      Magic? You bet!    </p>    <p>      Leona Guthrie<br />      Las Vegas, N.M.    </p>    <p>      Although we live in a large, crowded housing development,      we have a small greenhouse, a prolific organic garden, and      even a modest flock of chickens that provide us with fresh      eggs and meat. All of these do help considerably with      living expenses, but our family is large and we recently      got to the point where we needed a second income to      supplement my husband's.    </p>    <p>      Our predicament was that I had no work experience to call      upon. We were short on ideas and getting discouraged . . .      until a friend came up with the ideal (for us) solution. He      offered to teach me to cane chairs and do wicker work, in      exchange for our surplus garden produce.    </p>    <p>      I now have a thriving and enjoyable business that lets me      stay at home and yet bring in extra money, while our friend      receives a steady supply of fresh picked vegetables.    </p>    <p>      If you ask <em>me</em> , MOTHER, this barter idea of yours      <em>works!</em>    </p>    <p>      Nancy Cook<br />      Sacramento, Calif.    </p>    <p>      Citizens' band radio has introduced me to barter! Through      this enjoyable communication medium, I've met so many good      people . . . and made so many good swaps.    </p>    <p>      Recently, a CB buddy gave me a humidifier, a 20' pole for      my base antenna, and a small trailer, in return for various      radio components that he'll use to improve his own      broadcasting base.    </p>    <p>      I sometimes get requests to help other CB-ers install their      home stations, too. Generally, of course, this means that      the other parties involved will then lend a hand back when      I need it. For instance, I recently helped three fellows      put up their antenna systems and, in turn, they all pitched      in to help me install mine. A commercial installation would      have cost each of us substantially more, and then we      wouldn't have had the benefit of being able to converse      among ourselves.    </p>    <p>      So CB swapping not only enables me to acquire items I don't      have the money for, but also provides me with valued new      friends.    </p>    <p>      Daniel W. Raffety<br />      Jackson, Mo.    </p>    <p>      The most successful swap I've ever made occurred last      summer, when I broke an ankle just as my garden started      coming in.    </p>    <p>      I'd heard of the local custom of doing work "on shares" or      "on halves"-in which someone does most of the labor      involved (anything from gathering fallen pecans to picking      fruit) for half of the end results-but I'd never had      occasion to experience such an arrangement firsthand.    </p>    <p>      Since I was temporarily "out of commission", a distant      relative who was also a neighbor offered to pick and put up      part of my produce "on the halves". (She's elderly and      hadn't raised any extensive crops her self.) I accepted her      proposal with relief, and she harvested my vegetables, took      my jars and lids home, and returned with cases and cases of      canned foods.    </p>    <p>      Of course, we both benefited from the deal. Without my spry      kinswoman's help, my garden would have gone unpicked . . .      and had it not been for our trade she wouldn't have had her      share of all those winter preserves.    </p>    <p>      If more communities operated like ours, what a great world      it would be!    </p>    <p>      Mrs. J.M. Willtrout<br />      Mullin, Tex.    </p>    <p>      Our home is on Cape Cod, and the beach is our back yard. I      had been able to raise some crops on the      shore-despite the winds that come in off the      water-by using a cold frame. But growing tender      plants like eggplant and melons remained a problem until we      got friendly with a retired teacher who lives down the      block.    </p>    <p>      Ken had some open land in back of his house (away from the      beach), with only two old cottages on it. So I asked him if      I could spruce up the little houses for summer rental in      return for the use of a 25-foot-square garden on his      property. We were soon in business and my new vegetable      patch quickly began to thrive.    </p>    <p>      Our yields seemed endless last summer as we ate snow peas,      cucumbers, broccoli, four kinds of tomatoes, and many other      homegrown delicacies. In late November, I was still      harvesting things like cauliflower and parsley.    </p>    <p>      So barter wins again. We enjoyed free food from free land,      in exchange for something as simple as my time and labor .      . . which I love to give.    </p>    <p>      Stas Grabowski<br />      Provincetown, Mass.    </p>    <p>      Like many other MOTHER readers, we exchange labor for our      rent, vegetables we have for produce we lack, and piano      playing sessions for having our garden plowed. But this      winter we've arranged to trade three months of labor for      the fun and adventure of being in a different country!    </p>    <p>      Ellen's mother plans to build a house on land she owns in      Costa Rica. By bringing her labor force (us) along, she'll      gain two traveling companions, some steady workers she's      already familiar with, people she can consult when the many      inevitable building problems arise, and advocates of      alternative energy sources who want to make her homestead      as ecologically sound as possible.    </p>    <p>      In turn, we'll get to experience another culture (which      otherwise would be prohibitively expensive on our apple      pickers' wages). And all three of us will appreciate the      strengthened family bond this association is bound to      create!    </p>    <p>      Ellen Brooks & Dave Hackett<br />      Gays Mills, Wis.    </p>    <p>      Since I support my family with the few dollars my      handicraft items bring in, we seldom have any extra money      around. For this reason-and because we live in a tipi      and use horse and wagon transportation, which doesn't      endear us to the typical private campground owner-we      have frequent problems in our travels throughout New      England.    </p>    <p>      But we've worked out a nearly ideal (if temporary)      solution. Friends of ours said we could camp on their land      and use the grass, water, and wood we needed in exchange      for maintaining the grounds at their motel. Also, for doing      painting and general building upkeep, I was allowed to      display my crafts in the motel office . . . which brought      me a good many customers from around the country.    </p>    <p>      The motel closed after Labor Day, but that didn't end our      mutually beneficial relationship with the proprietors. As      my wife is very pregnant, I'm loathe to move camp just now,      so in return for improving the motel woodlot my family and      I have been made welcome here through the winter. With      careful management, the woodlot will now be profitable . .      . and next year's guests will find the patch of timber more      inviting now that there's a trail through it.    </p>    <p>      Tahca Ska<br />      Manomet, Mass.    </p>    <p>      I've rediscovered swapping, and I find it still produces      the silly, giggly excitement in me that it did when we used      to exchange baseball cards and student photos in grade      school.    </p>    <p>      Though I forgot about the fun of trading for 20 years, it      all came back after my husband and I bought some property,      became organic farmers, and generally transformed our      lives.    </p>    <p>      We went for a marriage encounter weekend, where we met      several really neat couples from our area. And it was      through some of these new friends that I was reminded of      the joys of barter.    </p>    <p>      I was secretly wishing for an herb garden like one of these      other wives had, you see, when one day she happened to say,      "I wish I could draw like you do."    </p>    <p>      "Hey," I shot back, "I'll teach you to draw if you'll give      me cuttings from your perennial herbs."    </p>    <p>      Well, that woman now draws better and better, and I'm      sitting here sipping my own blend of tea as I write this.    </p>    <p>      Next, my husband flipped for a beautiful lamp our new      potter friends had made . . . until he saw the $60 price      tag. When I sneaked back to them with an antique crock we'd      dug out of the cellar, however, they declared it to be of      equal value and we made the swap. You should have seen Al's      face at Christmas!    </p>    <p>      Dian Stout<br />      Penn Yan, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      With today's proliferation of "househusbands", many men who      work at home find themselves in need of either paying to      have their correspondence typed or mastering some      secretarial skills themselves.    </p>    <p>      Since my wife is in graduate school, and I'm faced with the      dilemma described above, I've hit upon the idea of swapping      baby-sitting for typing. I provide child care at the rate      of two hours for every one hour the typist puts in.      (Fellas! It gets you legitimately out of the house at      night!) The arrangement has so far resulted in about $60      worth of "free" secretarial work, plus many quiet evenings      spent reading articles I couldn't find time for on my      "dishpan schedule".    </p>    <p>      Dick Stanley<br />      Stanford, Calif.    </p>
