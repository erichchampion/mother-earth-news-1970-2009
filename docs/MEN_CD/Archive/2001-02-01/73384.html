                    <h5 class="byline">      by E d Smith    </h5>                        <p>      Then I started planting in beds, where the growing area is      two and-a-half to three feet wide. It now seemed reasonable      to consider mixing different plants and I found myself      revisiting the notion of companion planting. The idea      appealed to me in a general way because it's closer to the      way things happen in nature, where you won't find big      blocks o f just only one kind of plant.    </p>    <p>      Companion planting is based on the observation that some      plant seem to have synergistic relationships with certain      other plants One or both of them grow better, yield more,      and sometimes even taste better when they grow near one      another. I have found, however, that there's a lot more to      companion planting than simply pairing up plants that      benefit from one another's company. My wife Sylvia and I      have spent years trying different combinations, and our      garden now looks quite a bit different from the garden we      had in our first companion planting years. In fact, every      year's garden is an experiment. I can't take you on the      whole companion journey, because we're still en route      ourselves. But I can show you how we started while sharing      some of things we learned along the way.    </p>        <h3>      ELIMINATE THE NEGATIVE    </h3>    <p>      Companion planting begins with the liberating notion that      we can sow different plants in the same garden space. It's      important to remember, however, that while certain plants      will help others thrive, some plants inhibit their      neighbor's growth. The first step, then, in planning a      companion garden is to eliminate the combinations that      <em>don't</em> work. This is especially important if you      plant in beds rather than in rows.    </p>    <p>      In a traditional garden, the root systems of plants in      adjacent rows are kept apart by a wide band of compacted      soil that roots cannot penetrate. In beds, on the other      hand, plants may be only inches apart, so roots can spread      and intermingle. Thus, it is particularly important to      avoid antagonistic relationships - those in which the      growth of either or both plants is inhibited. Antagonists      should have at least six feet between them in a bed. Better      yet, put them in separate beds.<br />    </p>    <p>      You can avoid many problems by keeping a few entire plant      families away from each other. (See chart ) For example,      members of the cabbage and onion families don't get along      with members of the tomato and pea families.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes, plants <em>within</em> families don't grow well      together. They may be afflicted by the same pests or      compete for the same nutrients. Close cousins carrots and      parsnips don't get along; neither do potatoes and tomatoes.      A cabbage planted among broccoli will attract cabbage moths      as though it was among other cabbages.<br />    </p>    <h3>      POOR BEDFELLOWS    </h3>    <p>      Some insect pests have a taste for several different kinds      of plants. Pairing them up offers predatory insects a      one-stop smorgasbord. Take care to avoid the following      combinations:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Corn and tomatoes</strong> Call it a corn earworm,      call it a tomato fruitworm - it's the same beast in either      case and likes both crops equally. Keep some distance      between the corn and tomato patches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and eggplant</strong>      The striped Colorado Potato Beetle is a nightshade      nightmare and will feed on any plant related to potatoes,      such as tomatoes, peppers or eggplant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cucumbers, squash and melons</strong> Pickleworms      prefer cucumbers, but will happily munch their way through      a nice squash or melon.    </p>    <h3>      ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE    </h3>    <p>      Once I have a list of plant combinations that are likely to      fail, I look for the opposite: plants that thrive side by      side. Plants work in synergy for a number of reasons. Some      plants provide a better physical environment for one      another in terms of nutrient-, sun- and shade-sharing; some      plants act as natural insect repellents while others      attract friendly insects; and some beneficial combinations      are simply inexplicable mysteries.    </p>    <p>      The Summer Sandwich Sometimes we plant things together just      because they're likely to be harvested together, such as      basil and tomatoes-complementary ingredients for a salad or      sandwich. There are other reasons, however, why this might      be a good pairing. Tomatoes are big, heavy-feeding plants      with deep root systems; basil plants are relatively small,      light feeders with fairly shallow roots. Both plants,      however, are very sensitive to cool temperatures at either      end of the growing season and need similar protective      coverings, such as plastic tents or row covers.    </p>    <p>      The pest-repellent nature of certain plants has a      counterpoint: Some plants attract insects that are      <em>beneficial</em> to the garden    </p>        <h3>      OPPOSITES ATTRACT    </h3>    <p>      Deep-rooted plants thrive near shallow-rooted neighbors      because they draw nutrients from different places. Thus,      car rots make suitable companions for leaf lettuce,      arugula, garden cress and onions.    </p>    <p>      This pairing works the same way aboveground: Plants of      similar heights may compete for sunlight, while those of      different heights can share. Corn and potatoes can grow      peacefully in adjacent beds, but corn and indeterminate      tomatoes will shade one another.    </p>    <p>      Plants that require most or all of the growing season to      mature can have short-season companions. We sow a bit of      spinach between the rows of garlic soon after the garlic      shoots emerge in the spring. While it's there, the spinach      provides a living mulch for the garlic, discouraging weeds      and conserving moisture in the soil. By the time the garlic      needs all the space in the bed, the spinach is long gone.      Likewise, a small sowing of radishes, which will detract      some pests from more fragile plants, can go almost anywhere      in the garden and be up and gone long before it competes      with slower-maturing companions.    </p>        <h3>      SOW CONFUSION WITH INTERPLANTING    </h3>    <p>      Plant-eating bugs and some plant diseases love gardens laid      out in rows. Carrots here, tomatoes there, and all the      onions together somewhere else offers pests a minimall of      end-to-end munching.    </p>    <p>      Mixing things up makes it harder for diseases or pests to      gain a toehold. An onion disease harbored by some of the      onions grown from a set will not infect plants grown from      seedlings if the seedlings are in a separate bed some      distance away. Cabbage butterflies that have to flit all      over the garden in search of cole crops will get more      predatory attention than butterflies that can settle in one      bed. The greater the distance any bug has to cross from one      feast to the next, the more likely it will itself become      prey.    </p>    <h3>      BETTER HOME IN GARDEN    </h3>    <p>      One of our favorite companion planting combinations didn't      come from a list, but from figuring out through observation      how two plants might meet one another's needs.    </p>    <p>      When we started growing peas in wide beds instead of narrow      rows, we created a situation that begged for a companion      planting experiment: The peas did not need the space a 30-      or 36-inch-wide bed had to offer. At about the same time      the peas began to climb their trellis netting, a batch of      lettuce seedlings we started in the greenhouse were ready      to move to the garden. We paired them up in the bed and      found the combination quite beneficial to both. The peas      and lettuce didn't compete for sunlight - a bit of shading      from the peas actually helped the lettuce stay cool later      in the season so it didn't go to seed as quickly. The      lettuce acted as a living mulch for the peas, keeping the      soil moist and cool for the pea roots. Peas grown this way      were at least as productive as those grown alone, and they      produced over a longer season. The lettuce matured quickly,      producing very large heads that were both tender and tasty.    </p>    <p>      We have refined the combination over the years. At first,      we planted the peas down the center of the bed with lettuce      on both sides. The lettuce on the shady side grew more      slowly, but it ended up getting about as big and looking      almost as nice as the lettuce grown on the sunny side. But      it didn't taste as good. The shady-side lettuce heads were      older (and hence a bit tougher) and not as sweet. Now we      plant the peas closer to the northern edge of the bed - and      the lettuce all goes on the southern side.    </p>    <h3>      POISONOUS PLANTS    </h3>        <p>      Adding flowers to the vegetable and herb mix in a garden      does have one possible negative effect: Some flowering      plants might contain poisonous elements, which you don't      want to harvest along with the food plant. None of the      flowers we use or recommend are poisonous, but you're      probably going to want to try your own combinations. If you      want to experiment with combinations not on this or another      list, check to make sure the plants you try aren't      dangerous. Some examples you're likely to encounter are      lily of the valley, pasque flower and monkseed.    </p>        <h3>      COMPANION PLANTING FOR PEST CONTROL    </h3>    <p>      Certain bugs favor specific plants and seek them out to      feed upon. Those same bugs find other plants distasteful      and avoid them. If we mix the plants bugs deem tasty with      ones they don't care for, the bugs will become confused and      avoid the plants they like along with the ones they don't.    </p>    <p>      • All plant-eating bugs avoid members of the onion      family - probably because they stink. We don't know if the      odor repels pests, or if the onion-family aromas mask other      plant smells and prevent pests from finding them. In any      case, most garden plants will be less bothered by insects      if they live among onions or their relatives. Onions,      chives and garlic repel ants, aphids and flea beetles.      Garlic offends Japanese beetles, vegetable weevils and      spider mites.<br />      • Celery deters the white moth that begets the green      caterpillar that eats cabbage, broccoli and other cabbage      family crops. All heavy feeders with shallow root systems,      they'll need extra compost.<br />      • In adjacent beds, beans and potatoes make mutually      beneficial neighbors. The beans repel Colorado Potato      Beetles, and the potatoes reciprocate by driving away      Mexican Bean Beetles.<br />      • Radishes should go anyplace flea beetles are a      problem, since flea beetles would sooner eat radish leaves      - especially young and tender ones - than they would any      other leaves. Although radishes may suffer from      defoliation, they can withstand greater damage than most.      They can also deter striped cucumber beetles from      cucumbers.    </p>    <h3>      When an Ounce of Prevention Yields A Mess    </h3>        <p>      Mint discourages cabbage moths and ants, and horseradish      repels bean beetles, but both mint and horseradish are      hardy perennials that, left uncontrolled, will quickly take      over your garden and become pests themselves. You can still      use mint and horseradish as insect repellent companions in      the garden, but make sure they are securely contained.      Plant them in large clay pots and set the pots in the      appropriate beds of vegetable plants.    </p>    <h3>      SAY IT WITH FLOWERS    </h3>    <p>      Many plants give off volatile chemicals that are attractive      to the pests that feed on them. If you grow      stronger-scented plants among your vegetables, you may be      able to disguise or hide the crops' s cents and keep the      pests from finding them. Some of the possible      strong-smelling companions are other vegetables, but a lot      of them are herbs and many more are flowers. We began to      make our biggest breakthroughs in companion planting when      we started combining our vegetable, herb and flower      gardens.    </p>    <p>      • Marigolds are useful against aphids, Colorado Potato      Beetles and whiteflies.<br />      • Rosemary deters carrot flies and cabbage moths; sage      repels both.<br />      • Hyssop, wormwood, thyme and sage all repel the      cabbage moth.<br />      • Rue and white-flowered geraniums are offensive to      Japanese beetles.<br />      • Tomato hornworms don't like borage or basil.<br />      • Marigolds repel whiteflies, tomato hornworms, bean      beetles, cucumber beetles and asparagus beetles (see " All      That Glitters ").<br />      • Neither squash bugs nor whiteflies can abide      nasturtium.    </p>    <h3>      LURING THE HELPFUL INSECTS    </h3>    <p>      The pest-repellent nature of certain plants has a      counterpoint: Some plants attract insects that are      <em>beneficial</em> to the garden.    </p>    <p>      • Flowers of all sorts and some herbs attract      pollinating insects, and the more pollinators there are in      your garden, the more likely that fruiting vegetables will      be pollinated in a timely fashion. Borage and cleome lure      bees; dill, fennel, cosmos and marigold attract      butterflies.<br />      • Some pest-eating predators, like lady beetles, are      helpful to the garden both as larvae and as adults. Others,      like hover flies and lacewings, as larvae, feed on insects,      but as adults subsist on nectar or pollen.<br />      • Lady beetles like morning glory vines, angelica,      coreopsis, cosmos, sweet alyssum and tansy.<br />      • Hover flies - the larvae of which eat aphids,      various beetles and caterpillars, leafhoppers, mealybugs      and thrips-like chamomile, asters, cornflower, black-eyed      Susans and marigolds.    </p>    <p>      Many of the flowers that attract or provide shelter and      food for helpful insects are perennials - a fact you can      use to your advantage by locating your perennial garden      near your vegetable garden.    </p>    <h3>      SOFT SCIENCE    </h3>    <p>      Very little is known about why some of these plant      relationships are antagonistic or beneficial. It is clear,      for instance, why carrots benefit from proximity to onions,      leeks, rosemary, wormwood or sage: Carrot flies, whose      larvae attack young carrot roots, are repelled by the      aromas those plants give off. But why do carrots paired      with tomatoes or lettuce grow to mutual benefit? Why do      celery, parsnips and dill inhibit carrots? Nobody knows for      certain.    </p>    <p>      I have a few general rules I use to evaluate plant      combinations, then I check my results against the lists.      Consider all the advice, including the suggestions here, as      a starting point, rather than gospel. Keep track of the      results and compile your own list of garden companions.      Knowing the companion lists are mostly somebody's guesses,      I'm inclined to use my own best guesses as a basis for      garden experiments.    </p>    <h3>      THE BEST REASON OF ALL    </h3>    <p>      Shortly after sunrise, dew still shimmering on the      asparagus ferns, I head for the garden, coffee cup in hand,      to see if there's a morning glory blooming in the corn.      There is. So long as I'm there, I may as well pull a few      weeds, check for Colorado Potato Beetles, and maybe thin      the carrots.    </p>    <p>      Companion planting, particularly with flowers, has made our      garden a more pleasant place to be and enticed us to spend      more time there, which has had a beneficial effect on all      that grows there ...and on us.    </p>    <p>      Ed Smith gardens with his wife, Sylvia, and their children      in northern Vermont.
