                        <p>      The biggest enemy to your squash will be the hideously      hard-headed Squash Vine Borer (right). The adults emerge in      June and lay groups of small, blood-red eggs at the base of      the vines of curcubit: cucumbers, squash, pumpkins and      melons. If you don't notice and crush the easily spotted      eggs, they hatch and the larvae drill in and begin eating      their way up the stem - always toward the growing end.      Leaves wilt and blossoms dry up and drop as the larvae      pass. You can squash them inside the hollow stems or use a      wire to winkle them out. Bury the operated-on sections of      stems and they should recover. Egg-laying adult females      seem to prefer summer squash. Their larvae (below) are      unable to drill into the tough stems of even young      butternut winter squash. Some experts suggest planting only      butternut, using first sets of small fruit as a fresh      vegetable and letting later fruit mature for storage.    </p>
