                    <p>      A term coined by Richard and Karen Perez, the editors of      <em>Home Power</em> Magazine, the guerrilla solar movement      started when solar advocates, fed up with the bureaucracy      of utility companies, took things into their own hands.      Activists across the country are now tying their systems      into the grid without utility permission or knowledge.    </p>    <p>      Homeowners from one of the first documented acts of the      guerrilla solar movement became frustrated with the      requirement of the expensive, lockable disconnect, as well      as the multimilliondollar insurance policy. A statement      from them reads:    </p>    <p>      <em>"Is this fair? Is it OK? No, and it rubs us just wrong      enough to decide to do it without permission, without      disconnects, and without</em> <em>additional insurance.      Hence, guerrilla solar."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Guerrilla Solar Manifesto states that all energy is      freely and democratically provided by nature, and that the      monopolization of energy by utilities threatens our      environment and our planet. In sum:</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"We, the Solar Guerrillas of this planet, therefore      resolve to place energy made from sunshine, wind and      falling water on this planet's utility grids with or      without permission from utilities or governments. We      resolve to share this energy with our neighbors without      regard for financial compensation. We further resolve that      our renewable energy systems will be safe and will not harm      utility workers, our neighbors or our environment."</em>    </p>    <p>      It is unknown how many guerrilla solar grid-tied systems      exist, but a dozen of the systems are documented by      <em>Home Power</em> (homeowners' names omitted, of course).    </p>    <p>      Laurie Guevara-Stone lives in a grid-tied home with her      husband and son in Carbondale, Colorado. She writes and      teaches about renewable energy technologies at Solar Energy      International.<br />    </p>
