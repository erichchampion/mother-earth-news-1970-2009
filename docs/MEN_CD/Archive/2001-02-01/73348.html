                    <p>      As a landscaper and avid camper, hunter and hiker, I've had      more than my fair share of exposure to poison ivy. All of      the over-the-counter lotions and creams seem to be fairly      effective, but in my experience they don't go to work      quickly enough. I've found that rubbing alcohol takes the      itch away faster and dries the rash out in half the time      the usual remedies take. Alcohol might sting a little at      first, but I find the sting helps take my mind off the      itch.    </p>    <p>      One day after fresh contact with a poison ivy patch, I      discovered much to my horror that I was out of rubbing      alcohol. Desperate, I reached for the nearest available      alcohol-containing substance: hair spray. It worked like a      charm! The alcohol dried out the rash, and the hair spray      formed a protective barrier that kept the rash from      spreading and from being further irritated by contact with      my hair or clothing. Both alcohol and hair spray (I use      Rave #4) are quite inexpensive, and they're clear, so      nobody can tell you have them on.    </p>    <p>      NATALIE SCHRELL<br />      Knoxville, Tennessee    </p>
