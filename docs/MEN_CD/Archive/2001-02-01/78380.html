                        <p>      One of the challenges, if not <em>the</em> challenge in      buying an air filter is that there is no one way to judge      performance. A dozen manufacturers include the AHAM      (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers) test sticker      and/or logo (right and below), which often a mea surement      of airflow in cubic-feet per minute. The faster the flow,      the more rapidly room air is cleaned. How <em>well</em> the      air is cleaned is another matter entirely. AHAM advises      buying a unit with a CADR (clean air delivery rate) that is      two-thirds the square foot measurement of the room you      would like cleaned, provided that the ceiling is not      exceedingly high. A 20' x 10' room, then, would need a CADR      of about 140. Also, frequently seen on both portable and      whole-house filters and inserts is information from ASHRAE      (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and      Air-Conditioning Engineers). ASHRAE certification offers a      more informative measure of cleaning, in terms of      "efficiency," or the percentage of air contaminants      effectively filtered by the appliance.<br />    </p>
