                    <p>      About three years ago I discovered that my neighbor put      crow feathers around her mobile home roof to keep the birds      off, so I collected some myself and secured them to my      blueberry plants with twist ties. The birds did not bother      the blueberries at all. The next year I tied the feathers      all around in my garden, and once again the trick worked:      birds didn't touch anything, not even the green beans.    </p>    <p>      By the way, the person who sent in the suggestion in the      September "Lore" about lighting your pilot light with a      match held by a clothespin had a good idea, but a lit      strand of spaghetti works much better.    </p>    <p>      MRS.
