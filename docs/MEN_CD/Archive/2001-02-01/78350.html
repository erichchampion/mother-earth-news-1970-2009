                        <p>      There's not a whole lot of hard science backing up most      companion planting suggestions - they're based mainly on      folklore and the educated guesses of experienced gardeners.      Perhaps one of these days a lot of this advice will be      scientifically explained and proven, but some of it is      already withering under the glare of careful observation.    </p>    <p>      Many of the companion lists suggest that marigolds repel      some garden pests, particularly cabbage worms and Mexican      bean beetles. Research, however, shows that marigolds      actually attract cabbage butterflies, which lay eggs that      hatch into cabbage worms. Furthermore, though it does      appear that marigolds protect beans against Mexican bean      beetles and corn earworms, it seems they also exude      chemicals harmful to bean plants.    </p>    <p>      While on the subject of marigolds, we should examine the      oft-made assertion that they should be planted among      tomatoes to repel certain pernicious root nematodes. It's      not all that simple. Root nematodes bothersome to tomatoes      are discouraged only by certain French marigolds (Nemagold      and Queen Sophia, for example), and only when the entire      infested area is planted with marigolds for a whole season.      Simply planting a few common marigolds in among the      tomatoes will not do the trick.    </p>
