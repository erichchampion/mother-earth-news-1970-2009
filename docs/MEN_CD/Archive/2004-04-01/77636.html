                    <h3>      Readers' Tips to Live By    </h3>        <p>      <strong>Pecans for all Regions</strong>    </p>    <p>      The pecan is the best-tasting nut you can buy anywhere!      Well, that's my sentiment anyway. About 30 years ago, I      purchased 72 acres in Michigan. I then thought, "Why not      try growing pecans?" Being a semi-intellectual at heart, I      read up about pecans. There are three basic strains of      pecans: the northern, southern and western. The northern      strain is cold hardy to Zone 5. Good! However, I then      learned more. The nut, said the "experts," would not "fill"      in Michigan. This meant there would be a shell but no meat.      Bad!    </p>    <p>      Then, in a Northern Nut Growers Association newsletter, I      read about a planned expedition to southwestern Wisconsin      to search out productive, cold-hardy pecans. The expedition      was successful, and I bought about 25 nuts from the group      that I planted in late fall. Happily, most sprouted the      next spring.    </p>    <p>      I have more than 20 medium to large trees from this      planting. It took about 15 years for the trees to begin      bearing. The nuts from the trees that are bearing are not      only completely filled but also deliciously sweet, although      smaller than the southern variety. The nuts on the tallest      tree (almost 40 feet tall) start to ripen in early October.      To be successful at growing pecan trees, you need the right      strain for your environment. The Wisconsin strains came      from trees growing in Zone 4. If you live in Georgia, you      don't want to plant a northern strain. All pecan trees need      some cold, but those from the Far North need lots more cold      than those from the South!    </p>    <p>      Growing trees from nuts is the easiest and cheapest way of      starting your pecan plantation. All you do is plant the nut      about 3 inches deep where you want the tree to grow. Plant      in late fall-right after the nuts are      harvested-or keep the nuts refrigerated and plant      them in April. (Pecans purchased from the grocery store      usually will have dried out too much to be viable.) Taking      care of pecan saplings is simple-give them plenty of      water. Also, make sure that your children don't cut them      down, that you don't back into them with your pickup or      that your livestock doesn't eat them! Usually pecans are      harvested in autumn or early winter when the shuck loosens      from the shell or even splits open. Often, people wait      until the nuts fall to the ground on their own. However, if      you try this, you may find squirrels get them first.    </p>    <p>      For more information on northern pecans, contact the      Northern Nut Growers Association at <em>www.nutgrowing.org      .</em> My favorite pecan tree sources include Grimo Nut      Nursery [(905) 9346887; <em>www.grimonut.com ],</em> and      Nolin River Nut Tree Nursery ((270) 369-8551;      <em>www.nolinnursery.com ].</em>    </p>    <p>      TOM FOX<br />      Newago, Michigan    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bucket Brigade</strong>    </p>    <p>      I have a side room that gets flooded from time to time.      When my rusty wet/dry vacuum cleaner canister developed      leaks, I snapped the top onto a 5-gallon bucket. It works      great and the bucket has a handle, so I can carry the water      outside with less spilling. Sometimes I use four or five      buckets. When one is filled, I just snap the top onto      another empty and keep going.    </p>    <p>      CAROLYN LOWORN<br />      Woodland, Alabama    </p>    <p>      <strong>Barn Buddies</strong>    </p>    <p>      We are homesteading on 140 acres in northwest Ontario. This      area has a large number of insects, probably because of all      the water. We have two cows-one heifer and one steer;      about two weeks before they were born, I arranged for some      chicks to hatch.    </p>    <p>      When the calves were about a week old and the chicks were      feathered, I allowed the chicks into the barn. They stayed      with the cows and calves all day, eating the flies that      bothered the stock.    </p>    <p>      Everybody won-the cows weren't fighting the bugs, the      chicks got the protein they needed, and we got      great-tasting chicken and beef    </p>    <p>      ANN NEWMAN<br />      Dinorwic, Ontario    </p>    <p>      <strong>Handling Hoses</strong>    </p>    <p>      On my homestead, I use garden hoses for a variety of      chores. This means that I tend to leave multiple lengths of      hose and the connected attachments lying around in the      elements for months at a time. The brass couplings on hoses      can be prone to corrosion and seizing though, which may      result in leaky connections, difficulty in removing      attachments, or worse, being unable to disconnect the hose      from the faucet.    </p>    <p>      To prevent these problems, I apply a small amount of      antiseize compound (such as Loctite or Never-seez) onto the      threads of garden hose fittings. If there happens to be an      accumulation of lime or oxidation already on the threads, I      remove it with a small wire brush prior to application of      the compound.    </p>    <p>      Use the compound sparingly; the metallic paste is messy and      can stain clothes, so wipe off any excess with alcohol.      I've used this approach with my hoses for the last few      years with success; at the end of the season, I simply      disconnect everything without frustration. The antiseize      compound is inexpensive, and readily available through      hardware retailers and automotive supply stores.    </p>    <p>      DENNIS DIVINE<br />      Joplin, Missouri    </p>    <p>      <strong>Walking Builds Community</strong>    </p>           <p>      I am an avid walker who follows the same route every day. I      love the rhythmic pleasure of walking, the wind in my hair,      the rain on my face and the change of scenery wrought by      the seasonal changes.    </p>    <p>      But there is more to walking than exercise. When I go      walking, I also go visiting. Walking creates an interlude      in my day when I stop to talk with friends and catch up on      neighborhood news. Friendships grow from such small      encounters, and I feel my walking has spun a welcome web of      friendship around my neighbors and myself. I treasure the      people I've met and the community they provide.    </p>    <p>      Such connections have been possible because of the      regularity of my walks. I have followed the same route      every day for years, becoming a neighborhood fixture. As I      go by, neighbors cannot help but smile and wave.    </p>    <p>      Over time, waves turned into casual conversation, and      casual conversation into warm relationships, and, in some      cases, close friendships. It is almost impossible to see      the same people every day and not have a friendship grow.    </p>    <p>      Walking has also increased the variety of people in my      life. Through its simplicity, walking eliminates barriers      that keep people apart. I talk with neighbors of all ages.      We are at different stages of our lives, but my walk brings      us together, making it possible to offer each other a mix      of practical information, emotional support and new      perspectives.    </p>    <p>      Most special to me are the neighbors whose children are      grown. The wisdom of people who have "been there" has      helped me maintain my balance as I struggle to raise my      sons. I know that if I've had a rough day with a moody      teenager, I can go for a walk and run into one of my older      friends who will make me laugh. I suspect my children and I      are better off for it.    </p>    <p>      Some of the neighborhood exchanges are utterly mundane: We      share advice on how to get rid of the dog's fleas or how to      keep our daisies from dying. Sometimes we ask where to get      a lawn mower fixed.    </p>    <p>      And, we share our things and do each other favors, too. I      have shared flea spray, swapped flowers, tried out a      back-saving snow shovel and watered plants for neighbors on      vacation. We have brought each other casseroles when a baby      has arrived or someone is ill.    </p>    <p>      Such are the small exchanges of life that give comfort.      They remind me of the old-fashioned,      over-the-backyard-fence kind of communication that few      enjoy today. Without these simple connections, we feel      isolated.    </p>    <p>      Without walking, I have a hunch I would be one of those      women who doesn't know her next-door neighbor. Walking is      an antidote-it slows me down, gets me out, gets me      talking and socializing, laughing and crying. When I'm      walking, I'm visiting. I feel connected, whole and sane.    </p>    <p>      Not bad for a simple walk.    </p>    <p>      CHRISTINE RIDOUT<br />      Wayland, Massachusetts    </p>    <p>      <strong>Plant Protection</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you buy young trees and plants growing in black plastic      pots, keep them in shade until you plant them. If left in      direct sun, the black pots heat up and damage the roots.    </p>    <p>      GARY MYRONICK<br />      Port Townsend, Washington    </p>    <p>      <strong>Slippery Clean</strong>    </p>    <p>      Grass would always stick to the plastic underside of my      electric lawn mower, but the manual said never to use water      to spray it off. After a lot of hand brushing, I decided to      coat the shroud with spray vegetable cooking oil. When I      finished cutting the lawn, that shroud was sparkling clean.    </p>    <p>      DON PEYTON<br />      Monmouth, Oregon    </p>    <p>      <strong>Drying Herbs</strong>    </p>    <p>      I have found the perfect place to dry herbs: my car on a      hot, sunny day. I place fresh picked herbs in a large paper      bag, put the bag in the car and roll up the windows      (leaving one cracked a half inch to let moisture out). It      takes a day for the herbs to dry. Then I strip the leaves      from the stems and store them in an airtight container. An      added advantage: They're a lovely car air freshener.    </p>    <p>      MARIA BERGER<br />      Marshall, Virginia    </p>    <p>      <strong>Snackin' with 3 Sisters</strong>    </p>    <p>      Being part Blackfoot, I like to preserve my heritage      wherever I can, especially when it comes to working with      Mother Nature. I have tried growing the Three      Sisters-corn, squash and beans-a few times and      usually ended up with way too much of one or all of the      crops.    </p>    <p>      Then I stumbled upon a great combination that provides us      with snacks for the rest of the year. I grow popcorn,      pumpkins and pole beans.    </p>    <p>      It doesn't take up too much room in my garden, because they      are grown together. The popcorn grows strong and tall, the      pumpkin vines meander around the stalks and the beans use      the corn stalks for poles.    </p>    <p>      The best part is the harvest. We dry the popcorn right on      the cob, and I remove all of the pumpkin seeds, clean,      prepare and roast them. Packed in airtight packaging, both      crops last throughout the winter. Of course some also go      out to family and friends who enjoy them, too.    </p>    <p>      The pole beans may not sound like an ideal snack. But if      you have ever munched on a few right off of the vine, you      would think differently.    </p>    <p>      You can get popcorn from various seed catalogues and even      in some garden shops and nursery centers.    </p>    <p>      M. EILEEN O'DEA<br />      Central Bridge, New York    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dry-bean Britches</strong>    </p>    <p>      When I hear the word "britches," I picture men's trousers,      but I learned from a neighbor there is another meaning. We      were invited to supper and Mr. Thompson announced, "Maggie      will stir up a batch of leather britches, and we'll have a      feast."    </p>    <p>      We sat down to a fragrant, steaming bowl of long, green      beans topped with butter and bacon. "These are dried green      beans," my neighbor said. "In Montana, we string them from      wall to wall on heavy twine and let them dry; then we layer      them into big jars or crocks. To eat, we soak a      meal's-worth in water for a while, add a big chunk of ham,      salt pork or bacon, and cook until tender. A meal fit for a      king."    </p>    <p>      Now I plant plenty of 'Kentucky Wonder' pole beans to dry      on strings and enjoy all winter, too.    </p>    <p>      DORIS E.
