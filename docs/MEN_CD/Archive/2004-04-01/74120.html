                    <h5 id="byline">      By Terry Krautwurst    </h5>        <p>      My mother always knew where to look for me on windy days or      just before a sudden storm, when restless gusts stirred the      leafy treetops to a green froth and sent birds in the      darkening sky winging for shelter. She'd step out on the      porch and call to me in my high, hidden perch amid the      wildly swaying topmost branches of the maple near our      garage. "Better come down now," she'd holler, "before one      of those branches breaks." Then she'd go back indoors, both      of us knowing full well that nothing less than lightning,      hard rain or dinner time would prompt my descent.    </p>    <p>      I loved to ride the wind up there, my feet braced against      creaking limbs, my back to the tree's trunk lurching and      rolling like a ship's mast above tossing seas, the leaves      all around flapping and fidgeting, hanging on by their      stems for dear life. I loved the power and danger and      beauty of it: the heady height, the dizzying motion, the      push-pull force of wind, the sure answering strength of      limber living tree, the smell of green leaf flesh and      newborn air.    </p>    <p>      I'm speaking not just of childhood memories, but of moments      in the making of the love for nature that runs bone-deep in      me. There are many more memories I could relate: of fishing      in the wide, slickshale creek behind our house; of      countless days spent wandering the rolling fields of my      grandparents' farm; of pheasants bursting by the dozen from      hedgerows; of playing hide-and-seek in towering forests of      sweet corn; of crunch-crunch-crunching across acres of      iceglazed, sunlight-bejeweled snow.    </p>    <p>      This was my childhood and-I'm certain-the      reason why I feel such a sustaining connection to the      outdoor world. It's also, I suppose, why I feel so      compelled to instill the same bond with nature in my own      children.    </p>    <p>      That's easier said than done. Times, after all, have      changed. Far fewer children are growing up rural, like I      did. It's often not the outdoors but the indoors that      defines their environment. And speaking of the environment:      Isn't that something you learn about in school, along with      math and social studies?    </p>    <p>      Fortunately for parents, one truth remains: All children      are born naturalists. Wonder and curiosity come installed.      Just look in the eyes of any youngster watching a butterfly      or holding a lightning bug. See? The challenge isn't so      much to teach children about the natural world, but to find      ways-despite school activities, video games and the      other distractions of youth-to nurture and sustain      the instinctive connections they already carry. Here are      some ideas that have helped me in that pursuit. Perhaps      you'll find them useful for your own born naturalists.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ADVENTURES IN THE NIGHT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Children don't necessarily take to trudging for miles with      "nothing to do" (grown-ups call it hiking). But add the      element of darkness and you have a different      experience-an adventure. The night is full of      mystery, of spooky rustlings in shadowy bushes and odd      twitterings in the treetops. Mix in starlight and      permission to stay up past bedtime, and what child could      resist?    </p>    <p>      Most back yards are perfect for exploring the      night-unless you're surrounded by glaring      streetlights. Of course, if you happen to live near, or are      camping in, a state or national forest, so much the better.    </p>    <p>      Each of you should carry a flashlight, but first cover each      lens with red paper. The colored light will illuminate your      path but won't startle nocturnal animals, most of which      cannot see color. Remember, though, that it's the dark      you're out to discover. Keep your flashlights off whenever      possible.    </p>    <p>      Quiet also is important. Most people, even children,      respond instinctively to the night's hushed stillness by      moving quietly and speaking in whispers. There's something      about the darkness that pricks up our senses,      too-some remnant of our primeval past as prey and      predator, perhaps.    </p>    <p>      Certainly, there's plenty in the night to see, hear, smell      and touch. If you have a garden, watch for night crawlers      stretched from their holes like long, gluey fingers, each      straining for a leaf to drag into an earthy pantry. Ground      beetles and webless hunting spiders stalk among the tall      plant stems of meadows and lawns. Voles and white-footed      mice skitter through the leaf litter. Hungry bats scour the      skies for buggy meals.    </p>    <p>      One of my favorite night-stalking activities, especially      with youngsters, is moth baiting. Many moths and other      insects feed on fermenting tree sap or fruit. You and your      cohorts can attract such creatures by mixing a bait, or      moth "sugar," approximating those natural food sources. Try      this trusty formula: 1 overripe banana (mashed), 2 ounces      of apple cider vinegar and a half pound of brown sugar.      Paint a half-page-size patch of this goo on trees, rocks or      fence posts before sundown, then return at night to check      out the patrons.    </p>    <p>      Also, of course, take time to <em>look up</em> . The big      dipper, Polaris, the Moon, shooting stars -there's a whole      universe out there. Go ahead lie down on your backs and      take it in.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A LINE AND A POLE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fish, frogs, gooey algae, splashing water, worms and bugs,      something huge tugging on your line-fishing is just      plain <em>made</em> for kids. That most grown-ups like it      too-well, that's just the child in all of us coming      out to play. Nevermind that fishing teaches lessons in      conservation, aquatic life and food chains-fishing      is, first and foremost, flat-out fun.    </p>    <p>      Just grab a line and a pole (for about $15 you can pick up      a simple spin-cast reel and rod outfit, plus some hooks,      sinkers and worms) and head together for the nearest      fishing hole. Catching <em>something</em> is the only real      requirement. Farm ponds often are best, and most owners      will give permission if you're looking to fish with a      youngster. A stocked commercial fishing lake is a good      first-trip choice, too.    </p>    <p>      What's that-you haven't done much fishing yourself?      You're not sure you know enough to take your son or      daughter? That's great: You get the added pleasure of      discovering fishing together. Just grab two lines and      poles-and maybe peruse a book on the basics      beforehand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GET THE REAL STUFF</strong>    </p>    <p>      You should've seen my youngest son's wide eyes when he      opened the Young Astronomer's SuperPower Telescope ($250)      for his birthday. More importantly, you should've seen his      look of utter disappointment that night, when we set the      thing up and aimed it at the sky. At every touch the      plastic scope shook on its flimsy tripod like a      three-legged giraffe. Stars skittered about in the lens, no      more distinct than tiny fuzzy bouncing dots. Focusing was      impossible. Not even the moon came in clear.    </p>        <p>      I returned the "kid stuff" and for less money bought real      stuff: An honest tripod, a binoculars mount and a good pair      of 8x42 binoculars (8 refers to the magnification factor      and 42 is the millimeter diameter of the lens). Mounted on      the tripod, the binoculars pull in night-sky objects sharp      and bright. Stars and constellations multiply as if by      magic; the moon's landscape jumps out like a relief map.      Plus, the binoculars alone are great for daytime bird- and      animal-watching (and general child-style spying).    </p>    <p>      Toy microscopes usually disappoint, too-and are not      nearly as much fun for a child as the real-stuff      substitute: a quality hand lens. The microscope stays home      and provides dim views of prepared slides. A hand lens      folds into its own protective case, pops in a pocket and      performs amazing transformations of bugs, rocks and almost      any other everyday object. Dandelion flowers sprout throngs      of yellow Dr. Seuss-like characters; moss magically blooms      into a wizard's wilderness; tiny violets burst into ornate      bearded orchids; earthworms bristle with hairs. A good 10x      hand lens (higher magnification makes viewing difficult;      lower is less revealing) costs between $15 and      $40-truly a bargain.    </p>    <p>      The real-stuff-not-kid-stuff principle applies to many      other nature- and outdoor-related items, too: tents,      sleeping bags, backpacks, butterfly nets you name it. Get      the real thing.    </p>        <p><strong>      TIME ALONE    </strong></p>    <p>      It happened one day when I walked outdoors and heard a      distant "Hey Dad, look at me!" in the wind. I peered upward      to see two small legs dangling from a thin branch high in a      wildly swaying tree. My parental heart leapt to my throat      and before I could stop myself the words "Get down from      there right now!" came flying out of my mouth.    </p>    <p>      Even as a teenager, I knew I was fortunate to have grown up      in a place where I could spend a lot of time outdoors. But      it wasn't until that moment, as a father, that I came to      fully appreciate the role my parents had played by giving      me the freedom to discover nature on my own terms (within      reasonable limits, of course).    </p>           <p>      Today's children are better educated in ecology and      environmental science than any previous generation. It's      important knowledge. But nature is more than academic      fodder. The sun's role in the carbon cycle is one thing;      its warmth on the back of your neck, another. One can be      taught; the other must be <em>felt</em> .    </p>    <p>      Occasionally, I'll notice one of my sons off by himself,      sitting by our pond, watching dragonflies, or wandering in      our small woodlot. I'm tempted to go tell him something      about dragonflies, or to point out the goldenseal in the      woods. But I resist.    </p>    <p>      I know there'll be many chances for him to learn      <em>facts</em> about the natural world. What children need      most, I think, is just the time and opportunity to      <em>be</em> in the outdoors-to feel the pulse of      nature, to exercise their connection to it on their own, no      help required. Given that sort of learning, they'll do      fine. They are, after all, born naturalists. Just like me.      Just like you.    </p>    <p>      Want to share your experiences with children and nature?
