                		<h5 id="byline">		By Kris Wetherbee	</h5>	        <p>      There's no denying the lure of sun ripened strawberries      oozing with sweetness and flavor. Just catching a glimpse      of a rich, red berry is enough to arouse one's appetite,      and if appearances alone guaranteed good eating,      strawberries certainly would win an epicurean gold medal      every time.    </p>    <p>      Unless you live near a retail strawberry grower, growing      your own is the only way to get that splendid strawberry      flavor so lacking in supermarket crops. Truly ripe, tender,      juicy strawberries are just too perishable to be found on      any supermarket shelf; commercially grown strawberries are      bred for firmness, size and long shelf life - flavor      is secondary. In addition, they often are harvested before      the berries even turn red, a practice that halts the      development of the berries' flavor, but not their luscious      color.    </p>    <p>      Growing your own strawberries is also one of the easiest      and mast rewarding gar dening efforts you can undertake.      These modest herbaceous plants need only a small amount of      space in which to grow, and they produce large yields      quickly. Right now is the ideal time to make plans for      growing your own, so here are some considerations that will      help you succeed:    </p>    <p>      <strong>TYPES OF STRAWBERRIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Perennial garden strawberries come in three main types,      defined by when they bear their fruit, according to Barbara      L. Bowling, author of <em>The Berry Grower's Companion</em>      (available on MOTHER'S Bookshelf, Page 118) and formerly a      professor of horticulture at Rutgers and Pennsylvania State      universities. They are: June-bearers (also called      short-days), day-neutrals and ever-bearers.    </p>    <p>      June-bearers, available as early, mid and late-season      varieties, are the most widely grown by home gardeners,      accord ing to Bowling. As their name implies, they produce      their crop in June. Day-neutrals, which are gaining      popularity, bear a modest crop along with the June-bearers      and then continue to produce fruits into the fall. "They      initiate flower buds regardless of day length, thus      producing some fruit throughout the summer and a sizable      fall crop that is a great bonus for backyard growers,"      Bowling says. Day-neutrals, though, generally do not thrive      in areas that have hot summers (upstate New York summers,      for example, are ideal). Ever-bearers, which sometimes are      confused with day-neutrals, bear from early summer into      fall but are less productive and have lower-quality berries      than the day-neutrals. Nevertheless, their ongoing harvests      have appealed to many gardeners over the years.    </p>    <p>      You can harvest berries from day-neutral and ever-bearer      strawberries the first year; June-bearers should not be      harvested until their second year. In many areas, if you      grow a combination of these types, you will be able to      harvest your own sun-ripened strawberries from late May to      October every year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEST BACKYARD VARIETIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      You should seek out varieties of these types that are      especially adapted to your region; to learn the names of      tried-and-true local favorites, check with your extension      agent. A few varieties are widely recognized as among the      best tasting and most disease resistant no matter where you      live. These include June-bearers 'Earliglow' and Jewel,'      and day-neutral 'Tristar,' according to Bowling. Her book      lists recommendations by region and includes a chart that      details the disease resistance of common varieties.    </p>    <p>      Among other popular recommended June-bearers, 'Allstar' has      become the standard midseason variety in the East and the      Midwest, `Honeoye,' also a midseason berry, has a      "distinctive, perfumey" flavor, and 'Red Chief,' another      midseason berry, offers excellent disease resistance. Among      recommended day-neutrals, 'Seascape' is a large fruit with      good flavor for gardeners in the Northwest, but is      relatively new and untested, and 'Tribute' produces large      berries on vigorous plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GROWING TIPS</strong>    </p>    		 <p>      Strawberries may be highly perishable, but they will grow      well in a range of locations; plants produce the best fruit      when grown in full sun and a slightly acidic soil (a pH      between 5.8 and 6.5 is ideal). They are nutrient-demanding      plants, so care must be taken to provide a nutrient-rich      soil high in organic matter. Choose a site with excellent      air circulation and drainage (raised beds are good as long      as the soil doesn't dry out). Planting strawberries in rows      one-plant wide will help sunlight penetrate the entire      plant and increase fruiting. Avoid areas where tomatoes,      potatoes, eggplant, peppers or raspberries have been grown      in the past five years, as these plants can act as hosts      for verticillium wilt, which can attack strawberry plants,      too.    </p>    <p>      Grubs also bother strawberries by eating their roots, so if      possible avoid making a new strawberry bed where sod      recently has been removed. If the perfect site is nowhere      to be found, you still may avoid potential problems by      planting in raised beds and choosing disease-resistant      varieties, many of which are listed in Bowling's book.    </p>    <p>      Prior to planting, remove all perennial weeds and till in a      1- to 2-inch layer of compost, applying it more liberally      where soil tilth or fertility are less than optimum. You      can use grass clippings instead of compost as long as you      wait a few weeks before you plant to give the clippings      time to decompose. To be sure the shallow-rooted plants get      off to a good start, this is one time when a fast-release      fertilizer is appropriate.    </p>    <p>      For most of the United States, plant strawberries in spring      as soon as the soil can be worked. In warmer regions of      California and the South, strawberries usually are planted      as annuals in late summer or fall. At planting time, keep      these three things in mind: Holes should be wide enough to      accommodate the roots, carefully fan out the roots as you      plant and be sure the top of the crown (the dense area      between the roots and stem) remains slightly above soil      level while the roots are well buried below.    </p>    <p>      Bowling recommends planting strawberries in a system called      "matted rows." She says, "The strawberry's perennial nature      is used to best advantage in the matted rows by allowing      the plants to be replenished with new growth each year." In      this system, plants are spaced according to type (keep      reading), and runners, which are long, horizontal stems      that form small, "daughter" plants on the end, are allowed      to fill in empty spaces, renewing the planting as they      establish themselves.    </p>    <p>      June-bearers produce more runners than day-neutrals or      ever-bearers, and should be spaced 18 to 24 inches apart      with about 3 to 4 feet between rows. This spacing allows      the runners to root and eventually form a matted row. Space      day-neutral and ever-bearing types 5 to 9 inches apart,      with 24- to 30-inch aisles between each row. These two      types require a more constant nitrogen supply, so fertilize      them once a month from June through the first of September.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GROWING ON</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you get your strawberries in the ground and      fertilized, immediately follow up with a deep mulch of      straw, grass clippings or pine needles between plants.      Mulching inhibits weeds, conserves moisture, and helps keep      fruit clean and roots cool (especially important for      day-neutral types).    </p>    <p>      Water your new planting thoroughly and try to keep the soil      evenly moist as the season progresses; consistent moisture      is essential for strawberries' shallow roots, which need      about 1 inch of water per week during the growing season.      That's especially important in fall, when flower buds that      will turn into next year's crop are forming. "The more      cells that are formed in the flower bud, the larger the      fruit will be," Bowling explains. Weed beds weekly, too.    </p>    <p>      During the first year, no matter what type of strawberries      you choose to plant, the goal is to get your bed well      established. One way to help the plants settle in is to      remove all flowers for the first four to six weeks. Doing      this allows the plants to put their energy into developing      healthy leaf canopies, root systems and runners, and, as a      result, you can expect better yields in subsequent years.    </p>    <p>      If you are able to plant some of all three types, you will      have day-neutrals and ever-bearers producing berries the      first year after their first flush of flowers has been      removed. In subsequent seasons, you will harvest yields of      approximately 7 to 2 quarts of berries per season, per lin      ear foot of row. Ever-bearers bear the least, June-bearers      bear the most intensely (all in about three weeks for a      given cultivar) and day-neutrals the most, but over a long      period of time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>REGULAR RENOVATION</strong>    </p>    		 <p>      If you want strawberry fields forever, you should renovate      your beds after each harvest period. As a bed ages, the      plants become too crowded, berries become smaller and      yields decline. To renovate the planting, use a shovel or      tiller to narrow the rows to 6 to 12 inches and then thin      the remaining plants to about 4 to 5 inches apart, removing      older and small, spindly plants whenever possible. Then,      remove the old leaves by mowing the bed with the blade set      high enough to avoid hitting the crowns.    </p>    <p>      June-bearers and ever-bearers managed this way should      produce good crops of large berries for at least five      years. Day-neutrals will need to he replaced about every      third year.    </p>    <p>      After renovation, give all your strawberry beds, no matter      what type, a good weeding and feed the remaining plants the      equivalent of 5 pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer per 100 feet      of row. Renew mulch between plants and, where winters are      severe, cover plants with 3 to 4 inches of loose straw in      late fall. (Be sure to remove the straw in early spring.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>DISEASES AND PESTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most diseases that affect strawberries can be kept under      control by buying resistant varieties and practicing      careful cultivation. When you pick, remove any spoiled      fruits.    </p>    <p>      The major pests usually are birds (cover your ripening      fruit with bird netting), and slugs or snails, which can be      controlled by eliminating weeds, setting out beer traps,      using a copper barrier strip around the bed's perimeter or      releasing decollate snails ( <em>Rumina decollata</em> ), a      proven slug-and-snail predator sold in garden centers and      nurseries and available via mail-order.    </p>    <p>      A few insects can be a problem with strawberries. These      include the tarnished plant bug, a relative of the stink      bug; the little black sap beetle and the strawberry      clipper, but they usually are less troublesome on      strawberries than birds and slugs or snails.    </p>    <p>      Kris Wetherbee has tended strawberries for more than a      decade in her home garden in western Oregon.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Plant Plant Sources</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Miller Nurseries</strong> 5060 W.
