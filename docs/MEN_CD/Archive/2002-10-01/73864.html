                		<h5 id="byline">		By Joan Gussow | Illustration by Brain Orr</h5>		        <p>      With advisers Mary nselmino, <em>Michigan;</em> Gail      Feenstra, <em>California;<br /></em>Barbara Kingsolver,      <em>Arizona/Virginia;</em> Toni Liquori, <em>New York      City;</em><br />      and Jennifer Wilkins, <em>New York.</em>    </p>    <p>      I'm not in denial about global warming-far from it.      I've thought it likely that human activity was heating up      the Earth since I read the proceedings of a 1970s hearing      on the subject run by then-Senator Al Gore.    </p>    <p>      So by now I'm convinced that our dangerously ignorant      species is pushing up the thermostat on the only planet we      have. But I find it hard to keep that reality uppermost      when I'm under the spell of raspberries, though we're at      the edge of winter.    </p>    <p>      For the past few seasons, the fall raspberry plants that      regularly indulge me from August into October have      continued to fruit through strangely warm Novembers; more      improbably, the early bearers are rejoining the party.      Following horticultural orders, I pruned out their fruiting      canes when they finished bearing in July, leaving the new      canes to generate foliage and energy for next year's crop.      Instead, those newcomers are fruiting now-putting out      small clumps of double-lobed fruit that seem vulnerably out      of season.    </p>    <p>      It's tempting to relax and enjoy them, but we all know      there's a warning underneath the pleasure. When we talked      about this odd weather, Barbara reported the devastations      of Arizona's worst drought in recorded history-dying      desert animals dragging themselves into back yards,      desperately seeking food and water. There and elsewhere,      wildfires raged throughout the fire season, which we once      called summer.    </p>    <p>      Here on the East Coast, the fifth year of a prolonged      drought threatened our ability to garden last summer. The      vagaries of climate change now intermittently scorch us,      drench us with unprecedented floods and plunge us into      untimely freezes. That's the real face of global warming      and what we'll need to expect in the      future-chronically unstable weather, marked by      extremes of temperature and moisture that will allow us to      produce food <em>normally</em> only part of the time.    </p>    <p>      But global warming is not foreordained-humanity      forced it and can stop it. And as the nation that      contributes most-by far-to the problem, we in the      United States can participate hugely in its solution. We      need policy change-government support for our efforts      to become responsible global citizens-but we also      need personal change. Our food devours fossil fuels in its      production, processing, packaging and transport, thus      contributing mightily to global warming.    </p>    <p>      Growing food and buying it locally are not just healthy      pleasures, but powerful acts of resistance and restoration.    </p>    <p>      So I'll relish my late November raspberries as an      anomaly-we need to smile as well as worry-content in      the knowledge that my freezer and cold cellar are full of      homegrown food to keep me going through the coming winter,      whatever the weather.    </p>    <p>      Where I live, in downstate New York, this is the time of      year for tidying up stripping the last fruits from the      peppers, eggplants and tomato vines, then salvaging a final      zucchini. The plant remains can be hauled off to the      compost pile, or chopped in place and buried so the      nutrients they've removed can be returned directly to the      soil, together with all the energy they've stored in carbon      compounds.    </p>    <p>      Although most of my white potatoes have been dug before      now, in Michigan, Mary finds that hers keep longer indoors      if she leaves some in the ground until just before hard      frost. Obviously, underground spuds are hardy, as anyone      knows who has found potato sprouts urgently pushing through      the spring soil in beds they occupied the previous year.    </p>    <p>      Sweet potatoes, on the other hand, must come indoors before      the soil temperature drops below 55 degrees. Although      sweets are not an exclusively tropical crop as many      gardeners believe, they do like warm temperatures and make      their only serious demand right after they are dug: They      want to cure for a week or so in a warm and humid place. So      I put them in open boxes near a pan of water and an      automatic heater set to 80 degrees-covering      everything with a sheet, or putting the whole works in a      room with the door shut. After a week of curing, the tubers      will keep-as long as they're stored around 60      degrees-until the following summer. If you make the      mistake of storing them with white potatoes where it's cool      and damp. they'll shrink and turn black-and you won't      be able to make these delicious curried sweet potato latkes      ( see recipe ) through the winter.    </p>    <p>      Amidst all this talk of autumn harvest, Barbara reminds us      that some people around the country also are planting. Once      fall has tamed the fierce heat of summer. many gardeners in      southern regions plant everything that can stand a light      frost garlic, peas, broccoli, chard, lettuce. But north or      south, harvesting or planting, this is the season when all      of us above the equator watch together as the      northward-tilting Earth carries us rapidly toward the      year's shortest day. It's time to go inside and get some      reading done.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Curried Sweet Potato      Latkes</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      In a large bowl, mix together    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</em> <em>2 teaspoons      sugar</em> <em>1 teaspoon brown sugar</em> <em>1 teaspoon      baking powder</em> <em>1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder</em>      <em>2 teaspoons curry powder</em> <em>1</em> <em>teaspoon      cumin</em> <em>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</em>    </p>    <p>      To the flour mixture, add    </p>    <p>      <em>2 large eggs, beaten</em> <em>1/2 cup (or less) of      milk-just enough to make a stiff batter</em> <em>1      pound sweet potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated</em>    </p>    <p>      If batter is too stiff, add a little more milk. Drop batter      by spoonfuls into a preheated frying pan containing inch of      peanut oil. Flatten latkes with back of spatula. Cook on      each side until golden, and drain on paper towels. Makes      about 16 pancakes. Delicious! And they also keep well.    </p>    <p>      Joan Gussow's best-selling book, This Organic Life, is      available on MOTHER'S Bookshelf, Page 103.    </p>
