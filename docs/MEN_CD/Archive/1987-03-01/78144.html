                        <p>      Tackling the task of building my own home on the island of      Eleuthera brought me face to face with any number of      unexpected challenges...and rewards.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Jonathan B. Gans    </h5>    <p>      Photographed by Walter Chapell    </p>        <p>      [FLOOR PLAN] [FORM DETAIL]    </p>        <p>      In July of 1978 I arrived on the Bahamas "out island" of      Eleuthera for a week's vacation. For six days I played, and      on the seventh I bought land-so hard had I fallen for this      gorgeous place with its friendly people. A native said he      had a one-acre lot to sell and led me down a road to a      point where we faced a wall of "bush": dense, semitropical,      wild, green growth. He laid his machete to it and cut a      path another 200 feet to the edge of a very high cliff:    </p>    <p>      It was the sort of spot where you could easily imagine no      man had ever stood before. Straight down below me lay the      Caribbean Sea, clear as tub water straight to the bottom.      There wasn't another house in sight all up and down the      cliffs to the east and west. "Now under here," he was      telling me, "there's a cave that reaches back under the      cliff: I always thought if I built a house here, I'd blast      the rock out to where I could see water down there, and I'd      have a living room with a glass floor."    </p>        <p>      Thus began an adventure in home building that has changed      my life and probably prepared me to handle any building      problem, delay, or frustration known to man-as well as a      few known only to God and the Bahamas.    </p>    <h3>      Stranger in Paradise    </h3>    <p>      I returned in June of 1979 prepared to stay the summer, as      I'd left my job and wouldn't be starting a new one until      the fall. I walked down the same road and stood once again      before a wall of bush, now fully grown back over the path.      Everything else was exactly as I'd remembered it.    </p>    <p>      First thing: how to clear the site. The only bulldozers and      grading equipment on Eleuthera were those owned and      operated by the government to build and maintain the single      road that ran the entire 110-mile length of the island.      Like the rest of the island, my property was composed of      solid limestone and flint lying under a thin but rich layer      of topsoil-from which sprung the thick, constantly renewing      vegetation. Clearing this bush was no job for a city boy.    </p>    <p>      "You need to find a Haitian fellah," Fat Pig told me. Fat      Pig was a gentleman who lived in the town down the road      from my homesite. He was neither fat nor porcine, but this      was the name by which everyone in town addressed him. His      response was always immediate recognition, without a trace      of wryness, humor, or indignation.    </p>    <p>      I found a Haitian fellah, but he spoke very, very little      English. I took him up to the property and offered him my      machete, newly purchased at the General Supplies Store some      25 miles south in Governor's Harbor. The Haitian ran his      iron-skinned thumb along the edge of the blade, waved his      hand in refusal, turned, and walked away.    </p>    <p>      The next day, at what I considered the first light of dawn,      I walked from my rented house in town to the property to      begin, in the cool of the day, the job of clearing the bush      myself. I found the Haitian crouched at the edge of the lot      with a neat swath already cut down 180° before him. His      long, curved, cutlass-style machete moved steadily in his      right hand, while large clumps of grass and brush flashed      briefly in his left before landing in heaps. He      acknowledged my presence with a slight lift of his      head-nothing more. I noticed his blade was shiny silver,      and it looked sharp as a Wilkinson. When I lifted my own to      inspect it more closely, I discovered new machetes were      sold with a blunt edge, and mine was still square as a      bastard file. In fact, I didn't even own a bastard file      with which to sharpen it. In two days, working alone, he      cleared the entire acre of all but the few mature trees I      wanted to keep, and he heaped the brush-which had been      helpless before that blade-into neat piles, while singing      in Creole to no one in particular the whole time.    </p>        <h3>      Commission Mission    </h3>    <p>      A savvy Bahamian lady in town, connected by marriage to a      prominent family whose name was on almost every business      (including liquor, dry goods, grocery, gas, real estate,      and insurance), befriended me-as I am sure she did most      foreigners. She advised me that a set of building plans      would help speed approval of my dream house by the island's      Planning and Zoning Commission. The commission was a      recently established institution whose principal function      was to make certain "nothing get built which no hurricane      going to blow down." The other unstated function, she      didn't mind telling me, was to determine which contractor      among the commission members would prefer to build the      home. Construction work by foreigners was not the usual      rule.    </p>                    <p>      I wasn't a builder at the time, but I had stage-managed a      good many off=Broadway plays in New York City, where I was      living. I placed a call to a set designer friend in the      city through the town operator down at the switchboard      ("hours of business nine until nine") and asked him to draw      up a set of hurry-up floor plans and elevations from my      verbal description. Then I sent a sketch "air mail"      (carried by a returning tourist). When my city friend had      drawn the plans, my Bahamian friend would detail the      mandatory steel reinforcing and the hurricane clips and      steel-reinforced belt course around the top of what would      be 10"-thick rock and concrete walls. I abandoned the      see-through living room floor early on, but it would make a      brief, if chimerical, appearance later.    </p>    <p>      The plans arrived in 10 days, with a bill for total      "architect's fees" of $200. Praise be to the theater      network! I submitted them (in triplicate) and commenced      construction of the first building of my life-an      outbuilding-pending approval of the plans for the "main      house." This first structure was to be a small stone      cottage on which I'd learn and practice construction      methods-I called it my "mistake house." I'd also live there      while working on the main house. The commission returned      the plans after five weeks' study, covered with many      colorful stamps of approval and marked with cigar ash. I      asked the messenger, who happened to be the son of one of      the commission members, what had transpired in that      smoke-filled room. "Well sir," he said, "I believe it      require some time to figure out first what it was you were      trying to build. Then, once they could see what it was, I      believe they said if you want to mix all that cement and      lift all that stone for those walls, you could go right      ahead and do just that. Most people here won't build with      anything but cement block, and no one around want this kind      of job." That was how I became a builder.    </p>    <p>      Once the land was cleared, I needed power and water at the      site. I enlisted Charles Pierre, the reliable Haitian and      my new friend, to dig a trench for water pipe from the main      road some 400 yards away. Charles borrowed a pickaxe-he      called it a "grabhold" but made it sound like      "grubhoe"--and set to work through the hard ground and rock      up the road. He finished in 2'/2 days, in 95°F heat,      working alone . . . singing. A 6"-deep slit trench lay      there just straight and true as a line snapped along the      earth. The Commissioner of Waterworks in Governor's Harbor      then took two weeks to approve my permit application to tie      into the main island road's 6" waterline. In the meantime,      a fellow named Screed from town delivered two 50-gallon      drums of water daily in his pickup truck. When the crew      finally made it out to connect the saddle, tee, and shutoff      valve for my pipe, they left without installing a water      meter, since none was in stock. And, in spite of the      commissioner's awareness of this omission, I have enjoyed      unmetered water ever since.    </p>    <p>      Getting water to the site was easy compared to getting      electricity. You can't get what there isn't any of, and      there simply was no electricity nearby. The town had only      been electrified in 1965, and the power lines hadn't made      it out my way. The winds were steady but not strong enough      to power a windplant. Solar technology was still too      expensive, and I had no stream for hydropower. Then I met a      pilot who flew frequently to mainland Florida. We settled      on a special charter flight: He removed the seats in his      plane and replaced them with a cement mixer, generator,      wheelbarrow, and other tools needed to start serious      construction-including my very own grabhold!    </p>                    <h3>      Hurry Up...and Wait    </h3>    <p>      Progress is ill defined on this island. A good practical      definition might be, "As much as all unexpected natural and      human conditions and events allow you to get done. That      which bears no relation to your expectations or plans."      While it seemed a great deal was going on during the first      half of the summer, the signs of progress were slim: a      cleared lot, a quarter-mile water pipe with a faucet      sticking up out of the ground, a footing dug for the      "mistake house," and a crew of mason, carpenter, and helper      picked out from town.    </p>    <p>      The day the plane arrived with all the construction gear,      the island ran out of gasoline. None was expected for 10      days, when the boat was to arrive. So I settled the duty      bill of some 3507o value-added tax with the customs agency      and prepared to get along without electricity that much      longer. My framing and form-building lumber was also on a      boat-one that had been due weeks before from the mainland.      I wondered if the wood was on the same boat as the      gasoline, but was informed this was a foolish speculation.      Lumber and gasoline, "for safety reasons," would not be on      the same boat. Two boats, for sure.    </p>    <p>      Inexplicably full of optimism, I arranged the next week for      delivery of several loads of rain-washed sea sand and a few      more of a substance called "quarry." This mixture of      limestone rubble, rock, and sand, which comes out of the      ground naturally premixed, was an ingredient in all the      concrete prepared on site. Sensing the imminent arrival of      construction materials, I finally asked Screed, the truck      driver, if he could also bring me a pallet of 100-pound      bags of cement (42 bags, $8 each). "No problem," he said.      "Just as soon as they reach. Supposed to be on the next      boat."    </p>    <p>      The lumber landed first, so I started assembling the forms      for the rock and concrete with hand power. The house would      be built with wooden forms of varying length, 24" high,      placed parallel and 10" apart. After getting them plumb and      level, and positioning reinforcing steel and wooden door      and window frames, we'd place smooth facing stone flat      against the inside of the front form and pour concrete in      back of the stone to make the bulk of the wall. For the      next layer, we'd place a new set of forms atop the first      round.    </p>    <p>      Under normal, even remote, circumstances in the United      States, this would have been a very efficient, practical,      and rapid method of house building. In Eleuthera, however,      I wasn't getting too far too fast. I kept reassuring myself      that the experience, and not the schedule, was important.      At some point, time had to come back to my side.    </p>    <p>      During that very hot summer, the cement mixer arrived with      no instructions for assembly; the generator came without a      muffler, which made communication impossible whenever it      was running; the town pump ran out of gasoline seven times      (but I wisely purchased a can and habitually hoarded 2 1/2      gallons); it rained so much the main waterline pump house      at the foot of the hill just north of town flooded four      times and the pumps short-circuited, thus cutting off water      for two to four days at a time; the warehouse 25 miles away      in Governor's Harbor ran out of cement almost as many times      as I made trips to buy it (no telephone at the warehouse);      and when cement was in supply, progress was limited by the      diminishing capacity of Screed's wearing-out pickup truck      to deliver barely half a pallet to the construction site.    </p>    <p>      When I was temporarily out of something -be it sand,      cement, water, or power-there remained only one job that      could keep alive that familiar, civilized feeling of      progress: gathering stones. I pried, pulled, and piled up      enough stones from my property, the road, the bush, the      marshes, and the surrounding banana and pineapple fields to      build the mistake house <em>and</em> the main house.    </p>    <h3>      The Chimerical Floor    </h3>    <p>      Since there are no sewers on Eleuthera, it's the owner's      responsibility to dig his own cesspit and cover it with a      slab of concrete. I had to find a way to carve one out of      the solid rock of my bluff: Dynamite was recommended. I      received instructions on obtaining the highly illegal stuff      and arranged clandestine meetings with a gentleman easily      mistaken for a pirate. We exchanged a few dollars for      dynamite sticks, caps, and wire. And whenever I was ready,      he said, he'd lend me his car battery for detonation. I'd      never handled dynamite before, and the thought of all that      explosive power beneath the shirts in my dresser drawer      kept me awake a few nights.    </p>    <p>      Charlie was identified as the best man to drill the holes      for the charges. They were to be 3' deep, drilled through      solid rock with a <em>7'</em> -long, very heavy iron spike.      (No air compressors here.) It looked like Goliath's      javelin.    </p>    <p>      Charlie's technique was humbling to watch. He dribbled a      little water on the spot where he wanted to start the hole,      and then added a few more drops as it deepened slowly into      the rock. My Haitian friend stood above that small hole all      day long, day after day,    </p>    <p>      raising that iron spike and letting it fall straight down      through his hands-a human pile driver. I ached for him but      knew it was the only way to get the job done. I had to      remind myself often that Charlie was earning more each day      than he could have earned in a <em>week in</em> his      impoverished native land.    </p>    <p>      A Bahamian named Ghost Willie, from another village, heard      of this endeavor and rolled up one day in a whirl of dust      and a beat-up 60s station wagon, air hissing out of a leak      in one tire. Willie was quite drunk on rum and full of      excited offers to "blow the pit" for me. He had a car      battery, all right, and suggested we tie my 10 sticks to      one blasting wire and set it off all at once. I quickly      painted a mental picture of a cesspit as wide as the open      sea and a glass-floored living room, after all, created in      one step. Fish could swim straight through the kitchen. Of      course, there would be no cliff, so my view of the sea      would be at eye level. I steered the weaving and brave      Ghost Willie back to his car, fixed his flat, and sent him      back up the road with many thanks. That night I hid the      dynamite out in the bush.    </p>    <h3>      Acceptance    </h3>    <p>      On my early morning walks from the rented house in town out      to the building site, I received much encouragement from      townspeople along the route and from farmers starting out      on foot to their fields far from their homes. It seemed      there was new respect for the young white fellah who was      building a different kind of house all out of native stone      and who had stayed here all summer to do it.    </p>    <p>      The walls of the mistake house did rise quickly . . . once      everything was at hand. As the forms climbed higher, I      sought more help-both human and divine-to keep on lifting      and placing the facing stones, buckets of concrete, and      filler rock. Charlie and I broke out "Eleuthera champagne"      (Beck's beer) when we'd smoothed off the reinforced "belt      course" at the top of the walls around the perimeter of the      small house. No more cement mixing! Two days later, the      generator overheated and threw its piston right out of the      cast-iron engine block, forcing my return to hand power to      build the roof. I finally understood why these were called      the out islands: We were always out of something. As we      shared our "champagne" and toasted our real progress, I      hoped I would never be out of Charlie.    </p>    <p>      My last week on Eleuthera was almost unbearably hot. The      earth, the air, the breeze, and the seawater were all too      warm to offer any relief from the heat that rolled sweat      off of you while you simply stood still. The daily, cooling      afternoon rains had inexplicably stopped, and moisture      built up steadily in the air. Nobody, was working outside,      but I still had to install the door and two windows, and      shingle the roof of the mistake house.    </p>    <p>      Over beers one night at the Old Man's Bar in town, the talk      turned naturally to the heat wave. Some Bahamian      friends-Mr. Cool, Boy Lee, The Professor, and Fox-all      cautioned me not to shingle that roof-small as it was-until      the tongue-and-groove sheathing was "wetted" by a good      rain. Otherwise, bad luck. I agreed the V joints would      probably swell and tighten to a sound fit with a little      moisture. But time was running out on me, and I doubted      roofing contractors on the mainland hoped for rain before      shingling. Charlie agreed it would be better to wait, but      he also offered a ritual Haitian inducement to rain: "Slit      the throat of a young rooster at the peak of the roof. Rain      come before the next new moon."    </p>    <p>      I gave Charlie's advice deep consideration. Arising early      the next morning, I affixed a nozzle to the garden hose,      aimed it high over the roof, and got the boards good and      wet. Shingles went on the next day.    </p>    <h3>      And Then...    </h3>    <p>      Every year for the next four years, I returned to Eleuthera      during the sensibly cool month of January to work on the      main house. I'd spend four weeks of refreshingly calm      isolation living in the cool little mistake house, which      served as equipment storeroom in my absence. With a crew of      seldom more than two or three, we dug the footing trenches      by hand; mixed all the concrete for the walls; placed all      the stones; sawed, bent, and placed the reinforcing steel;      and made the 4 X 8 window and door frames by hand (using      lap joints, dowels, and glue).    </p>    <p>      It wasn't until January 1985 that money, time, and manpower      permitted us to roof the 2,000-square-foot main house,      including its second-story loft and guest bedroom. Six days      a week for four weeks, six of us put up the partial second      story, built in the floor joists for the decks and      balconies, and raised and shingled the roof. This time the      rain came all on its own.    </p>    <p>      During this seven-year adventure, I don't know if I've      learned much from particular mistakes, or just learned to      adapt to a whole new set of scaled-down expectations      enforced by nature, the calm and peaceful Bahamians, and      this peculiar island latitude. But I do know that I am      decidedly different than I was when I started. I listen,      think, and mentally complete a project now before I pick up      the first tool.    </p>    <p>      For the first six months of 1986, my wife, our 18-month-old      son, and I went down to Eleuthera and, with a crew of now      close Bahamian friends, finished the interior of the main      house. We installed four sliding glass doors and 18      windows, built 30 ' of birch kitchen cabinets, and      continued the cool and native feel inside with much      hand-placed stone, white plaster walls, and whitewash on      louvered doors, open-beamed ceilings, and 8"      tongue-and-groove pine paneling.    </p>    <p>      Over the years, two more small gasoline generators      succumbed to exhaustion, and we finally built a generator      house on the garden side for a four-kilowatt LPG      twin-cylinder beauty with a heavy-duty muffler and remote      electric start. The on/off button is next to my nightstand.      Then in March 1986, the utility poles finally marched to      within a quarter mile of us, and we ran the 220-volt lines      ourselves, pulling the wires through the 1 1/2" PVC pipe      all the way up the hillside to that "close" pole. I think      it was the most tiring job of all. Perhaps it was also      difficult, even when offered the wonderful convenience of      "town power," to let go of that hard but still delicious      remoteness so rare in this world.    </p>    <p>      Difficult, but not impossible. As soon as we were hooked      up, we ordered the biggest refrigerator in the Sears      catalog-complete with ice maker. These days we keep      Eleuthera champagne cold and ready for the drop-in guest-a      welcome feature of life without telephones. Every visitor      from town now agrees that thick stone-and-concrete walls      make for a nice, cool house on a hot day. The ocean breezes      help too.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the main house wasn't completed without a few      more mistakes-and controversial design features-but I have      become experienced enough over the years to know how to      cover them up or even highlight them. They're architectural      touches now, and make visitors real envious.    </p>    <p>      Take the stone shower in the master bathroom. It took a      while to find stones smooth enough to face the walls . . .      and a while more to convince Dr. Black, the mason, that a      stone shower was at all practical. Finally he relented:      "You just bring the stones. I'll make it look good."    </p>    <p>      As he was pointing up the last few crevices in his very      fine job-certainly the first stone shower he'd ever      built-Charlie ambled to quietly, as is his way, and watched      intently for some time. He seemed transfixed by the      glistening chrome and black shower valve nestled quite      professionally in the mortar and stone. I came up and      proudly asked him how he liked it. Charlie had learned some      English over the years, and he nodded slowly, indicating      the valve handle. "That for satellite dish?" he asked.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Jonathan and Luralyn Gans now rent their      guest bedroom and the mistake house as a bed and breakfast.
