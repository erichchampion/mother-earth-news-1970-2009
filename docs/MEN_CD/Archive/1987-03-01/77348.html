                         <p>    <strong>A roundup of the best vegetable varieties for      '87.</strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">		By Brent Elswick</h5>    <p>      <em>Strange...that's</em> the only word I can think of to      characterize the growing conditions here in Kentucky last      year. Instead of a season we had a series      <em>miniseasons,</em> a kind of climatic obstacle course      that included a hard frost (22Â°F!)- in mid-April, a      soil-parching mid-summer drought (from which some southern      farmers may <em>never</em> recover), and (ironically)      torrential rains late in the season. Still-despite      the whimsical weather-I managed to nurture several      hundred new vegetable varieties in my trial gardens. Here      are the results: the easiest to grow, the most productive,      the tastiest, the hardiest-my candidates for Crops Most      Likely to Succeed in your ,garden in 1987.    </p>    <h3>This year's new seeds should excite the      most blase gardeners.</h3>	  <p>      Lettuce    </p>    <p>      At the top of the lettuce list-and one of the finest      new looseleafs to come along in many a year-is Tango, an      introduction from W. Atlee Burpee Seed Co. (Warminster, PA      18974) that produces tangy, dark green, endivelike leaves      in just 45 days. Tango simply dances circles around the      competition. Also, for sheer beauty as well as good flavor,      you'll want to try Lollo Rossa, a European type from      Shepherd's Seeds (7389 W. Zayante Rd., Felton, CA 95018)      that yields lovely, deeply crinkled, dark crimson leaves in      56 days.    </p>    <p>      Among the butterhead lettuces, Ben Semen from Gleckler's      Seedsmen (Metamora, OH 43540) is a standout-it produces a      large head and delicious leaves even in warm weather when      others fail. Anuenue from Johnny's Selected Seeds (Albion,      ME 04910) and Reine Des Glaces from Le Marche (P.O. Box      566, Dixon, CA 95620) are superb Batavian head lettuces.      Anuenue thrives in most any season, and the Le Marche      variety has gorgeous, lacy leaves. Three new iceberg types      deserve your attention, too: the redleaved Rosa from Geo.      W. Park Seed Co.    </p>    <p>      (Greenwood, SC 29647) . . . the crisp, sweet,      superproductive Wallop from Thompson and Morgan (T and M,      P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, NJ 08527) . . . and the tasty, fast      yielding Queen Crown from Vesey Seed (P.O. Box 9000,      Houlton, ME 04730). All three thrive in cool weather and      can be planted very early' in the season.    </p>    <p>      Last, those of you who favor cos (or romaine) lettuce will      love Craquerelle Du Midi from The Cook's Garden (P.O. Box      65, Londonderry, VT 05148). This one is an excellent choice      for gardeners in warm climates.    </p>  <h3> Radishes</h3>  <p>      I like to sow radish seeds right along with my lettuce, and      you can bet this year I'll again include Flamavil from      Johnny's in my salad patch. The long, supercrunchy root      matures in a mere 27 days and resists pithiness like no      other. I also like T and M's extra-long (four-inch) radish,      dubbed Rave D'Amiens. It's slower-growing than many but      well worth the wait. And don't overlook the exquisite Green      Meat, a three-incher from Le Marche that's green at the      top, white at the bottom, and delicious through and      through. I also recommend Crystal    </p>    <p>      White, a disease-resistant, pure white variety from Harris      Moran Seed Co. (Rochester, NY 14624) that produces tasty      four-inch roots in just 30 days. A more traditional      roundtype radish is Scarlet Knight from the Holmes Seed Co.      (2125 46th St. N. W., Canton, OH 44709). Bright red, early      maturing, resistant to yellows (a common radish disease),      and truly delicious, it outjousts even its royal      predecessor, Red Prince.    </p> <h3>  Spinach and Greens</h3>   <p>      The top choice for spinach this year is a versatile      smooth-leaf hybrid called Olympia, from Ed Hume (P.O. Box      1450, Kent, WA 98032). It's delicious whether you eat it      raw in a salad or cooked-and you'll probably do plenty of      both, since it thrives from spring to fall. Another      excellent new spinach is Hybrid 612, a highly      disease-resistant curly, or savoy, type that is being      offered by Meyer Seed Co. (600 S. Caroline St., Baltimore,      MD 21231).    </p>    <p>      One of the best new varieties of greens for 1987 is an      unusual Dutch development called Tyfon, available from      Midwest Seed Growers (505 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO      64106). Tyfon is a cross between Chinese    </p>    <p>      cabbage and turnips. It's winter-hardy, yet resists bolting      in hot weather, producing large, green, mild-tasting leaves      nearly year-round. Another unusual variety is Le Marches      Giant Red Mustard, a Japanese savoy that produces beautiful      red leaves (they turn green when cooked). And Bau Sin from      Gleckler's is a dwarf plant that yields short, wide, thick      petals for frying, cooking, or pickling. Finally, there's      one good new variety for kale lovers: Premier from Hastings      Seeds (P.O. Box 4274, Atlanta, GA 30302) is superproductive      in both spring and fall.    </p>  <h3> Turnips</h3> <p>      Des Vertus Marteau, an early-maturing, half-long French      type offered by Cook's Garden, is my top-rated turnip for      '87. The four- to six-inch roots aren't especially      attractive, but they're tasty as can be. (As the old-timers      around here might say, "It's ugly, but it ain't bad eatin'.      ") And incidentally, if your climate provides cool springs      and long autumns, I hope you'll try growing rutabagas this      year. This close cousin of the turnip, popular in Europe      and Canada, deserves more attention from American      gardeners. Fortune from Gaze Seed (P.O. Box 640, St. Johns,      Newfoundland A 1C 5K8) is an excellent choice.    </p> <h3> Onions</h3>  <p>      One of the best new onion varieties to come along in years      is Super Apollo from Twilley Seeds (P.O. Box 65, Trevose,      PA 19047). This medium-sized, long-storage onion matures      early and produces beautiful dark bronze bulbs. Another      exceptional keeper-this one from Canada-is Simcoe, a      particularly pungent offering from Lindenberg Seeds (803      Princess Ave., Brandon, Manitoba R7A OP5).    </p>  <h3> Peas</h3><p>      If you want a really early crop of peas, try Extra Early      Alaska from Wyatt-Quarles (P.O. Box 739, Garner, NC 27529).      Resistant to wilt, this one goes through anything from      blizzard to drought to produce huge harvests. Hyalite from      Fisher is also a good early. Plant it and in just 65 days      the tidy 30-inch plants will be loaded with beautiful dark      green peas ready for picking.    </p>    <p>      Some folks prefer climbing varieties, and there are three      fine shell-type climbers this year. Show Perfection from W.      Robinson produces wonderful peas, perfect for both table      use and freezing, on four- to five-foot vines. A Johnny's      offering, Multistar, is similar, though more suited to      eating fresh than frozen. And Bountiful Gardens (5798 Ridge      wood Rd., Willits, CA 95490) now offers Pilot, an      extra-hardy four-foot climber that's long been popular in      England.    </p>    <p>      Closer to the ground is my top candidate for Rookie Pea of      the Year, the impressive dwarf variety Olympia from Ed      Hume. I can't remember growing a more perfect variety of      table pea. The short, sturdy vines produce loads of plump      five-inch pods, and are so disease-resistant I'm tempted to      say they're immune.    </p>    <p>      Believe it or not, Burpee has improved on the famous      edible-pod Sugar Snap variety with its new Snappy. Like its      better-known predecessor, Snappy must be staked, but as a      reward you get huge crops. Sugar Daddy from Seedway (Hall,      NY 14463) produces tasty pods similar to Snappy's, but the      plants are a tidy 24 to 30 inches. Like other snaps, it's      delicious raw in salads or munched fresh off the vine.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Coles can both reward the beginner and      challenge the expert.</strong></strong>    </p>    <h3>Cole Crops</h3>  <p>      Of the new early-maturing cabbages, Babyhead from Fisher is      among the quickest to come to harvest, producing two- to      three-pound heads that are sweet and tender yet firm.      Another tasty early type is Delicatess from Gaze Seed. No      tough ribs here; just sweet eatin'. And if you love stewed      cabbage, don't overlook a wonderful, extra-early Japanese      semisavoy called Salarite, from Gurney. Two early Chinese      cabbages deserve a date with chopsticks this year, too:      Early Top from Johnny's, and Chi-Hi-Li from Sanctuary Seeds      (2388 W. 4th Ave., Vancouver, British Columbia V6K 1P1).    </p>    <p>      Main-season varieties are the staple of the cabbage patch,      and there are lots to choose from this year. For an      all-purpose type that produces loads of blue-green heads      over a long period, try Quisto from Pinetree Garden Seeds      (New Gloucester, ME 04260). Burpee's Tri Star is another      all-around winner that yields whopping seven- to      eight-pound round, slightly flattened heads that are great      fresh or made into kraut. And if diseases plague your      cabbage crops, go for the productive, yellows-resistant      Falcon from Stokes Seeds (P.O. Box 548, Buffalo, NY 14240)      or for Superlite, a variety that's resist ant to black rot      and yellows, from Reed's Seeds (Cortland, NY 13045).    </p>    <p>      Apex from Johnny's and Lennox from Seedway are both superb      late-season cabbages that hold up nicely against frost and      resist cracking in the field. For some color in your fall      garden, try Le Marche's late maturing red savoy, San      Michelle, or Territorial's 140-day Red Rodan.    </p>    <p>      Stokes's Polar Express tops the list of new cauliflower      offerings; an improved Snow Crown type, it offers more leaf      coverage and an even better-quality head. Other fine new      cauls include Matra from Reed's, Alpha Begum from      Territorial, and Sicilian from Good Seed (P.O. Box 702,      Tonasket, WA 98855). And finally, there's Igloory, an entry      from Halifax Seed (P.O. Box 8026, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3K      5L8). Its generous leaf coverage and super cold tolerance      make it a great choice for fall plantings.    </p>    <p>      The good news for broccoli lovers this year (particularly      impatient ones) is Park's Early Emerald. It's probably the      earliest-maturing broccoli variety ever offered. Moreover,      it tastes great, it produces like crazy most all summer-at      least until the dog days of August-and it's resistant to      just about every known broccoli predator. Put it on your      must-grow list. Another comer for '87 is Septal from      Pinetree. Though not nearly as early as Early Emerald,      Septal's great cut-and-come-again properties make it a fine      choice. So is Hybrid Packer, a sweet, tender,      extraordinarily heavy-yielding broccoli from Lindenberg      Seeds. I also like Royal Cruiser from Le Marche, Emperor      from Johnny's, and Ed Hume's Northwest 29. And if you      haven't tried the unusual broccoli-cauliflower crosses yet,      you're really missing something. There are T and M's      Floccoli, Romanesque from Le Marche, and Bronzino, an early      type from The Cook's Garden.    </p>    <p>      If you're a Brussels sprout fan, plant Stabolite Hybrid      from Territorial Seeds, and you'll be harvesting sprouts      long after other types have pooped out.    </p> <h3>  Beets</h3>  <p>      Half-long, carrot-shaped beet varieties have become      popular, and one of the best is Forono from Gurney. This      one keeps longer in the field without becoming soft or      spongy. A similar type is Cylindra, a gorgeous dark red      beet perfect for slicing. If you prefer round beets but      hate thinning your plantings, try the new single-seeded      monogerm sorts. Mobile from Johnny's and Pacemaker 111 from      Liberty Seed (P.O. Box 806, New Philadelphia, OH 44663) are      two of my favorites. Also from Johnny's is Dwergina, a      smooth-skinned traditional beet that's free of zoning (or      uniform in color).    </p><h3>Carrots</h3> <p>      You've heard of supersweet corn? Well, here's a supersweet      carrot: the scrumptious A-Plus, a new Nantes-type variety      available from Stokes (and others). It's great for the      market, for home canning, for fresh munching-for any      use-and it offers twice the carotene and vitamin A of most      other varieties. A-Plus definitely gets an A+ in my book.      Other fine Nantes carrots include T and M's distinctively      dark red Redca (extra good for juice), Rondino from      Johnny's, and Seedway's Nantucket. For long, tapered      carrots like the ones Bugs favors, try SixPak from Harris      or El Presidente from Letherman's Seeds (1221 Tuscarawas,      Canton, OH 44707). Less attractive but just as toothsome is      the short, stump-rooted Early Horn, a Bountiful Gardens      offering ideal for a winter crop.    </p>    <p>      Corn    </p>    <p>      Corn is king in the vegetable garden and, apparently, among      seed companies; there are <em>many</em> new varieties vying      for your attention. For really early yellow corn, try Early      Arctic (60 days) from Degiorgi Seeds (P.O. Box 413, Council      Bluffs, Iowa 51502; catalog, $1). Or you may want to opt      for the later maturing but weather-tolerant Earlipak by      Lockhart Seeds (3 N. Wilson Way, Stockton, CA 95201).      Lindenberg's Kodiak Hybrid (68 days) and Stokes's Sweet      Star (68 days) are also good. The best early <em>white</em>      corn in my trials was Glacier (60 days) from Fisher Seed.      Early bicolors include Classic Touch (60 days) from Vesey,      and Stars-N-Bars, a 68-day entry from Seedway that's      tolerant of cold soil. Maturing three or four days later      are two good bicolor supersweets, Sugar Buns from Holmes,      and Twice-As-Nice, a variety from Agway Seeds (1225 Zeager      Rd., Elizabeth town, PA 17022) that has a one-inch-thick      husk to discourage birds and insects. The standout of      standouts, though, was Twilley's early yellow supersweet,      Party Time (67 days). This is the best early supersweet      I've ever grown, period.    </p>    <p>      My midseason choices include three Liberty offerings: Early      Summer Delicious, a yellow, and two bicolors, Bi-Honey      Crisp and Double Delight. All come on in less than 80 days.      A bit earlier is the tasty, plumpeared yellow variety      Supreme from Harris.    </p>    <p>      The best new <em>main-season</em> supersweet corns are      Wisconsin Natural from Gurney and Sweetie from Farmer Seed      and Nursery (Faribault, MN 55021). There are several great      supersweet bicolors worth space in your garden all season,      too: Park's wonderful Butterfruit Bicolor, Johnny's      Starstruck, and Stokes's Milk 'N' Honey. Double Taste from      Twilley is sugar-enhanced but, unlike true super-sweets,      can be planted with regular corn. I also like several new      main-season white corns: Snowbelle and White Knight, both      from Letherman's, and Harris's delicious Silverado.    </p>    <p>      Finally, if you love homegrown popcorn, treat yourself to      Iopop, a yellow hybrid that pops up big and fluffy. Or try      the unique Indian Ornamental Pop, a popcorn that's as tasty      as it is decorative. Both varieties are from Liberty.    </p>    <p>      Beans The best of the beans this year is E-Z Pick from      Johnny's. It produces Blue Lake-quality beans, but on      an entirely different kind of plant: The pods hang high off      the ground, where they are easily harvested. Hy Style from      Harris is another classy new green bean, great for canning      and freezing. I also If you try only a few new seeds, check      out my all-star team! like Shamrock, a Blue Lake type from      Orol Ledden & Sons (P.O. Box 7, Sewell, NJ 08080). Of      the non-Blue Lake green beans, I favor Pinetree's Sunray,      Fisher's Montana Green, and Demeter from D.V. Burrell Seed      Growers (P.O. Box 150, Rocky Ford, CO 81067). Delinel from      Vesey is best for growing in cold soil . . . and Dandy,      from both Degiorgi and Halifax, is a' great early bush      bean.    </p>    <p>      What? You still haven't-tried yellow wax bush beans? I have      three dandy new varieties this year to convert you to a wax      bean fan: the heavy-yielding Golden Rod from Stokes, Park's      delicious Goldkist, and (for folks north of the Ohio River)      the early yielding Galagold from Fisher.    </p>    <p>      Another good pick for northern gardeners is Johnny's Geneva      lima bean-most limas won't tolerate cold soils, but Geneva      will. And for folks in the South who like baby green limas,      Wyatt-Quarles's disease-resistant Eastland is a sure      producer.    </p>    <p>      Last, there's the unusual Turkey Craw pole bean from Seeds      Blum (Idaho City Stage, Boise, ID 83706). The story goes      that the seed for this old variety was first found in the      craw of a wild turkey brought home by a hunter. All I know      is that the beans taste great and (unlike other pole beans)      stay tender even when mature.    </p> <h3>  Cucumbers</h3><p>      There are three delicious slicing cukes to recommend this      year: Hy-Slice from Midwest Seed, Salad Bar from Holmes,      and Marketsett from Stokes. Hy-Slice and Salad Bar are both      unusually disease-resistant, and Marketsett-an update on      the popular Marketmore slicing cucumber-earns high marks      for size and productivity.    </p>    <p>      For those with tender tummies, there are the burpless      cukes. Pinetree's Euro American and Burrell's Tenderfresh      produce smooth, six-inch fruits, and Le Marche's Swallow is      an excellent long burpless.    </p>  <h3> Peppers</h3> <p>      If I had to choose only one sweet pepper variety to grow      this year, I'd have a tough time deciding between Park's      terrific new Blocky Bell and Harris's Cubanelle-type Key      Largo banana pepper. You just don't find a better      all-around bell pepper than Blocky Bell; huge peppers,      perfect for stuff-mg or for salads, hang in abundance from      a really strong plant. And Key Largo is delicious fresh or      fried; if you let the big seven- to eight-inch fruits ripen      to a beautiful red, you'll swear they're the best peppers      you've ever eaten.    </p>    <p>      Those aren't the only great sweet peppers for 1987, though.      Among green bells, I also like Bell Captain from Twilley's      and Bell Tower from Porter and Son (P.O. Box 104,      Stephenville, TX 76401). Of the golden bell peppers, I      recommend Gold Crest from Johnny's, Summer Sweet from      Twilley, and Stokes's Klondike Bell. And two of the      prettiest peppers I've ever grown are Johnny's Sweet      Chocolate, a bell type, and Gleckler's Choco, which      resembles a pimiento. Both are a beautiful brown, and turn      bright green when cooked.    </p>    <p>      If small, hot peppers light your fire, go for Park's Thai      Hot-but you'd better be sure you like 'em really fiery.      Other incendiary midgets include Craigi Hot from Porter,      Triton from T and M, and Good Seed's Tipin.    </p>    <p>      Twilley's Tycoon is a superb long eggplant . . . the dark      purple or black fruits are delicious prepared most any way,      and they keep well, too. For two really unusual eggs, try      Gleckler's Pinky and Pink Bride. Pinky looks pretty much      like a regular eggplant, except that its huge, oval fruits      are a lovely light pink-violet color. Pink Bride also      blushes pink-violet, but the fruits are slender and about      seven inches long. And then there's Le Marches Bride Asian      eggplant. The strong but compact plant bears clusters of      eight- to 10-inch fruits that are a gorgeous light lavender      with white stripes probably the most beautiful I've ever      grown.    </p> <h3>  Tomatoes</h3>   <p>      There's a bumper crop of super new tomato varieties to talk      about this year. One of the best <em>early</em> tomatoes      I've ever grown is Revolution from Twilley's. This hybrid      has everything-size, production, fine quality, and      disease-resistance-and matures in only about two months.      Try it for sure. And if you have the space, add a planting      of another good early tomato: Better Girl from Tomato Seed      Co. (P.O. Box 323, Metuchen, NJ 08840).    </p>    <p>      Large-fruited <em>main-season</em> tomatoes are the ones      most gardeners go for, of course, and there are some      terrific new big 'uns for '87. Leading the list is Burpee's      outstanding Lady Luck; it's even more disease-resistant      than the renowned Big Girl, and produces lots of juicy,      meaty, 12- to 16-ounce fruits. Another fine offering is      Pinetree's Cavalier; it yields somewhat smaller (eight- to      10ounce) tomatoes . . . but they're large enough to please,      and plenty tasty. Other worthwhile whoppers include      Hastings's heavy-bearing Stakebreaker, and Ledden's      Heavyweight. I also recommend Rebel Red from Tomato Growers      Supply (P.O. Box 2237, Fort Myers, FL 33902) and Opal's      Homestead from Abundant Life Seeds (P.O. Box 772, Port      Townsend, WA 98368).    </p>    <p>      Two really fine canning tomatoes are San Pablo-a      superproductive, pear-shaped type from Gleckler's-and      Grinta from Le Marche. Grinta produces lots of long,      sausage-shaped tomatoes on a narrow-leaved, deceptively      sickly looking plant. It's an odd one, but a good one. The      best <em>stuffing</em> tomato I've ever had in my garden is      Tomato Seed's Liberty Bell-beautiful to behold and just the      right shape for stuffing with anything from meat to cottage      cheese.    </p>    <p>      I even have two excellent <em>pink fruited</em> tomatoes to      recommend this year. Andy's jumbo from Good Seed looks just      like the fine old Ponderosa variety, but the fruits are      smoother and the plant is stockier and easier to grow.      Also, Tomato Seed is offering Brandywine, a famed old      variety reputed to be the best-tasting tomato ever. Why not      grow it yourself and find out?    </p>    <p>      Finally, for cherry tomatoes, look no further than Baxter's      Early Bush Cherry from Tomato Growers and Castlette from      Agway. Either will reward you with loads of delicious      little fellas. If you prefer <em>yellow</em> cherries, go      for Golden Pygmy, a Le Marche dwarf that produces tiny but      oh-so-tasty fruits.    </p>    <h3> Cream of the Crop</h3> <p>      So there you have them: the Rookies of the Year, the best      new varieties I tested in my trial gardens. Every one can      make your 1987 growing season the most productive ever. Now      let's go back and review the varieties I'd plant if I could      plant no others-the best of the best, the Brent Elswick      Super-Deluxe Cream-of-the-Crop All-Star Team:    </p>    <p>      Tango Lettuce from Burpee, Olympia pea from Ed Hume, Park's      Early Emerald broccoli, A-Plus carrot from Stokes,      Twilley's Party-Time sweet corn, E-Z Pick beans from      Johnny's, Blocky Bell pepper from Park, and Burpee's Lady      Luck tomato.    </p>    <p>      So, gang, let's get out there and garden; 1987 promises to      be a very good year!    </p>
