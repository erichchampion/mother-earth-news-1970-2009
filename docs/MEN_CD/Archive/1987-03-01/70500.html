                    		<p>      <strong><strong>This conservation organization helps      property owners reduce taxes while protecting land and      wildlife.</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      High in the Colorado Rockies, near the little town of      Pagosa Springs, sits the Moore Ranch-a paradise of      mountains and meadows filigreed with sparkling snowmelt      streams. Owners Joe and Beth Moore love it. So do their      cattle. And so do the herds of deer and elk that wander      down each fall from the mountains, crossing the ranch en      route to their traditional wintering grounds in the      sheltered valleys below...only to turn around a few months      later and follow the spring green-up back across the ranch      to their high-country summering meadows. For as long as the      Moores can remember or imagine, this annual circular      migration has been a part of the land.    </p>    <p>      In recent years, however, the people have come. Herds and      droves of people. And with the people came subdivisions      looking like prairie dog towns, condominiums like anthills,      and a blight of summer ranchettes along either side of the      twisting two-lane blacktop that divides high country from      low. Before much longer, the Moores knew, most wildlife      migration routes would be sealed off by this onslaught of      development, leaving hundreds of deer and elk stranded in      the high country each winter to starve and freeze.      Something had to be done, and the Moores were of a mind to      do it.    </p>    <p>      What Joe and Beth did-with encouragement and guidance      from a San Francisco-based land-conservation organization      called the Trust for Public Land (TPL) and a Pagosa Springs      citizens' group called Upper San Juan Land      Protection-was to designate a permanent conservation      easement across the 363-acre portion of their ranch that      serves as a wildlife migration corridor.    </p>    <p>      Land ownership encompasses a bundle of separate      rights-mineral, water, agricultural, development, and      others-with a landowner having the power to sell or give      away some rights while retaining the rest. A conservation      easement is a legal instrument with which the landowner      separates and retires the right to subdivide and develop      the land. Under the terms of the Moores' easement      -which was legally attached to the property's deed      and thus is binding on all future owners-Joe and Beth can      ranch their land as always, continue to control public      access, and pass the property on to their heirs or sell it      as they desire. But the 363 acres dedicated to the      conservation easement can never be subdivided, developed,      or used in any way that would interfere with its      suitability as wildlife habitat. The Colorado Division of      Wildlife-to whom the easement was granted for      guardianship-will inspect the land annually to assure that      the terms of the easement are being met.    </p>    		<p>      When an easement is donated to a local land trust, the      donor generally is expected to make a contribution to an      endowment that covers the costs of establishing baseline      data, annual monitoring to assure that the terms of the      easement are being met, and enforcement if necessary. The      amount of this contribution, which is tax deductible, is      negotiated with the land trust and is based on the      complexity of monitoring and other anticipated      difficulties. For the Moores' easement, the main expense      was a "before and after" appraisal to document the value of      the income tax deduction.    </p>    <p>      The satisfaction of knowing they've done something      significant to preserve the land and its watersheds,      wildlife, and agricultural status is the greatest reward      for Joe, Beth, and the numerous other landowners who have      granted a total of 51 conservation easements protecting      66,482 acres in the Rocky Mountains alone. But in addition      to these intangible rewards, the donation of a permanent      conservation easement can also earn significant income,      estate, and property tax benefits for donors. These      benefits are based on the premise that a reduction in the      sales value of the land will result from the development      restriction. Here's how it works:    </p>    <p>      When a piece of land's development value is donated to a      qualifying conservation organization, the monetary      equivalent of this right becomes deductible from the      landowner's income taxes as a charitable contribution.      Additionally, the appraised value on which the property and      estate taxes are figured may also be reduced. This can mean      the difference between a landowner's heirs being forced to      sell inherited family land in order to pay estate taxes,      and keeping the farm in the family.    </p>    <p>      In order to be deductible for income tax purposes, a      charitable easement must meet what is known as a      conservation test. The Moores' easement qualified because      it protects important wildlife habitat. Other values the      IRS will grant easement deductions for include the      protection of natural ecosystems, the preservation of      outdoor recreational areas open to the public, the      conservation of open space that provides scenic enjoyment      for the public or that furthers an adopted governmental      conservation policy, and the protection of historically      important land areas or buildings (known as preservation      easements).    </p>    <p>      The second major requirement for tax deductibility is that      an easement must be donated for guardianship to a      qualifying conservation organization-such as a citizens'      land trust (like Upper San Juan Land Protection) or to an      agency of local, state, or federal government (such as the      Colorado Division of Wildlife). Helping people organize      land trusts and teaching them how to assure that their      conservation easements will be legally correct are among      the services performed by the Trust for Public Land.    </p>    <p>      But not all TPL projects involve conservation easements or      large parcels of land. The Clinton Community Garden in New      York City is an urban Eden of magnolia trees, grape arbors,      and flower and vegetable plots greening a tiny, city-owned      lot.    </p>    <p>      About six years ago, concerned neighbors rescued the lot      from trash-strewn neglect and converted it into a lush      garden and neighborhood park. When the city later decided      to sell the lot, worth about $900,000, TPL and concerned      Clinton neighbors launched a "Square Inch Campaign" in      hopes of raising enough money to save the garden.    </p>    <p>      The campaign received substantial media attention,      ultimately raising about $100,000 - an incredible      demonstration of grassroots support, yet far short of the      goal. Fortunately, an intense lobbying effort finally      convinced Mayor Ed Koch that the site was of critical      import to New Yorkers as an urban breathing space. By      executive order, the mayor transferred the lot from the      city's Division of Real Property to the Department of Parks      and Recreation. The Clinton Garden was saved, and the      $100,000 raised through the Square Inch Campaign was placed      in a fund to maintain Clinton and protect other Manhattan      community gardens threatened with loss of their sites.    </p>    <p>      A sampling of other TPL-assisted land conservation      projects:    </p>    <p>      • Working with concerned residents to organize Puget Sound's      Whidbey-Camano Land Trust. In partnership with TPL and the      National Park Service, this local group has accepted its      first easement protecting a panoramic trail area in the      Ebey's Landing National Historic Reserve.<br />• Helping guide the      Thousand Islands Land Trust into existence. TILT works to      protect an area of more than 1,700 islands on the St.      Lawrence River by acquiring easements that restrain the      development pressures threatening to mar the pristine      character of this great waterway.    </p>    <p>      In addition to working with individual donors and local      conservation trusts, TPL also acts directly to acquire      property that has environmental or public-use significance,      frequently negotiating below-market-value purchases.      Property thus acquired is then conveyed to public agencies      or private nonprofit organizations for long-term      management. Any profit accruing to TPL is used to cover      operating costs or recycled to finance future land      conservation acquisitions.    </p>    <p>      When asked to summarize his organization's philosophy,      Trust for Public Land President Martin J. Rosen quoted John      Muir's visionary statement on growth and preservation: "Not      blind opposition to progress, but opposition to blind      progress." Since its inception in 1973, TPL has completed      317 park and open-space projects in 25 states, rescuing      over 316,000 acres from just the sort of blind progress      Muir opposed.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like more information on tax-deductible      conservation easements, forming a citizens' land trust in      your area, establishing or preserving an oasis of green in      an urban desert, or other ways of protecting significant      land resources, contact the TPL regional office nearest      you.    </p>    <h3>      TPL OFFICES    </h3>    <p>      Headquarters:<br />      82 Second St.<br />      San Francisco, CA 94105<br />      415/495-4014   </p>    <p>      Northeast Office:<br />      666 Broadway<br />      New York, NY 10012<br />      212/677-7171   </p>    <p>      Southeast Office:<br />      322 Beard St.<br />      Tallahassee, FL 32303<br />      904/222-9280   </p>    <p>      Northwest Office:<br />      625 Commerce, Suite 330D<br />      Tacoma, WA 98402<br />      206/627-7774   </p>    <p>      Southwest Office:<br />      P.O.
