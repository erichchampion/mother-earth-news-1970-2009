        <hr /><p>Coffee drinkers of the world, unite! Take a stand against skyrocketing java prices!</p><p>The South American plantation owners who produce the raw product . . . the people who buy and sell coffee on the "commodities market . . . the makers of Maxwell House; Yuban Nescafe, and other major brands of Java.. . all would have us believe that the only way are can indulge oar thirst for an aromatic . dark-brown breakfast drink is to buy their wares and pay their prices, no matter how outrageous those prices might be. It simply ain't so:</p><p>There's no reason in the world to spend up to $5:00 a pound for ground roast coffee (or up to $10 a pound for instant). . when you can brew your own perfectly satisfying coffee substitutea from inexpensive, readily available (not to mention wholesome and nutritious) cereal grains and vegetables. Yes, cereal grains and vegetables. Back in the 30's-when money (and coffee) was a good deal scarcer than it is now-many people couldn't afford to drink real coffee. Instead, they brewed . a variety of mock javas from barley, rye, wheat, oats; flax, and other common foodstuffs. And in some cases, the dark-brown beverages that resulted were said to have a significantly better flavor than real coffee.</p><p>Whether the mock Javas listed below are better- or worse-tasting than your favorite freeze-dried or ground roast coffee is something you'll have to decide for yourself. One thing is certain, however: Unless you do try one or more of the following concoctions, you'll never know bow satisfying coffee substitutes can be . : . and you'll never know how mach "coffee money" you might have been able to save!</p><h3>PARSNIP POSTUM</h3><p>Marjorie Meschke of Calder, Idaho claims it's possible to make a richly satisfying coffee-like drink from-of all things parsnips: "It's true" she says: "I served some parsnip coffee to my husband recently; and he thought it was the real thingl I had to tell him what it was. Even then, I don't think he believed me: He was amazed!"</p><p>Here's all you do to duplicate Marjorie's recipe: Cut a batch of fresh parsnip roots (skins and all) into very small pieces, or grate the roots as you would hashbrown potatoes. Dehydrate the bits well, then roast 'em in a 400째F oven until they're a very dark brown (about 20 minutes). Turn the oven` off and allow the crunchy morsels to cool as the oven itself cools:</p><p>Then get oat your favorite mug, steep the parsnip chunks in scaldinghot water (one rounded tablespoonful per cup), and presto! You've got a Java substitute that-in Mrs. Meschke's own words-"is better than coffee . . . with no bitternessl" "I've tried other types of imitation coffee," says Marjorie. "They're good, too. . . but they don't come close to 'Parsnip Postum'!"</p><h3>WHEAT JAVA</h3><p>No parsnips in your garden? Don't fret. You can make a deli cious (and delightfully low-cost) coffee substitute from wheat and molasses . . . the very ingredients used in store-bought Postum.</p><p>Start with six cups of cracked wheat. (If you have a coffee grinder; use it to grind the wheat on a medium setting. Otherwise, bay the wheat already cracked.) Combine the grain with a cup of milk, a half cup of molasses; and one-half teaspoon of salt . . . mix well . . : then spread the result paste out thin on cookie shee and bake in a 300째 oven. Kee an eye on the Java main's they'll tend to burn easily.) Who everything is brown, turn the oven to low and allow the wheat molasses mixture to dry until it's crisp.</p><p>All right: Now flip the coating out onto a flat surface, break it into pieces and put the pieces through a coffee grinder or food mill (or take a rolling pin to the crusty wheat-molasses combination). Add one cup of ground coffee to the brown powder and store the blend in sealed jars or cans.</p><p>Jenny Pringle of Mesa, Arizona - who's made a good many pounds of "Wheat Java" over the years (and who sent us this recipe)-says to "boil or perk the final product as you would any coffee . . . it's good to t drop</p><h3>CHICKPEA SURP</h3><p>Garbanzo beans-plaiW chickpeasalso make a satisf tory coffee-like drink, according to Irene Potter of Neosho, Mis souri. All you have to do, Irene says, is [1] roast some chickpeas' in a 300째 oven until they're "the color of roasted coffee beans", then [2] grind the brownblack nuggets, (in a blender, coffee grinder; or Corona-type mill) to the consistency of canned percolator-type coffee. ("Bigger chunks are better than a very fine grind," Ms. Potter advises. "They leave less residue in the pot.")</p><p>To prepare a pot-of "chickpea coffee"; simply measure the grinds oat the same as you would regular Java, perk them in a percolator until the liquid looks like fresh-brewed coffee, pour, and enjoy. If you don't have a percolator; just boil the chickpea granules in water. (Be sure, though, to let the boiled pot stand for a few minutes before pouring-or else use a tea strainer-to keep "sludge" from finding its way to the bottom of your cup.)</p><h3>BARLEY BREW</h3><p>Barley-either by itself or in combination with other grainsmakes a surprisingly good mock Java, too. And-at 20 to 254 per pound-the price is certainly right.</p><p>Mrs. R. Van Ryzin of Stratford, Wisconsin recommends the following procedure: First, spread a thin layer of barley (husks and all) onto a cookie sheet . . . then place the sheet inside a 425째 oven and bake the grain (stirring frequently) until it's uniformly dark brown. Finally, grind the browned barley in an old coffee mill, food mill, or blender.</p><p>To make "Java", just perk one heaping teaspoon of barley per cup of water. Says Mrs. Vans Ryzin: "You won't believe the aroma. To me, it's just like Great Grandma's house used to smell is the early morn!"</p><h3>AND THERE'S MORE!</h3><p>Parsnips, wheat, chickpeas, and barley aren't the only ingredients that can be used to make rich, goodtasting coffee substitutes.</p><p>Oats, fax, rye, and (of course) chicory can also be made into delicious Java-like beverages . . . or coffee extenders. (Think how far you can stretch your coffee dollar by combining any one of the above ingredients with your favorite ground roast coffee!)</p><p>The high price of jays got you down? Relax. Brew up some Parsnip Postum or Wheat Java or Chickpea Surprise or Barley Brew: Have a good hot drink. And think of how much money you're savings!</p><hr /><p>More information on the making of coffee substitutes can 6e found in the booklet Mock Java, available for` 62.00 (plus 75d postage and handling) from General Printers, 13483 King George Highway, Surrey, B.C., Canada B3T 2T8, or from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.
