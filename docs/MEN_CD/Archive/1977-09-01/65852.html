                    <h2 id="subtitle">     WHO READS MOTHER ANYWAY ?    </h2>		<hr />    <p>      There's little need to tell you (after all, you are reading      MOTHER!) that a great many people today are [a] interested      in living more self-sufficient and self-reliant lives and      [b] concerned about modern society's continuing rape of the      planet.    </p>    <p>      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), as you know, was expressly      founded to search out and publicize ways [1) in which all      we "little guys" can take control of our individual lives      back into our own hands while [2] exploring energy,      construction, gardening, recycling, and other ideas that      will allow everyone to live more lightly on the earth.    </p>    <p>      And as you may or may not also know, a considerable number      of what we think are the finest people who ever lived      (youse guys out there who read this sheet!) have thrown in      with us on this search. MOTHER NO. 47 (this very issue),      for instance, had a press run of 550,000. And since (unlike      most other magazines) we don't print 'em unless we already      know where they're going (it saves a lot of trees that way)      . . . and since we know that approximately 4.8 people read      every copy of MOTHER that does get printed ... this means      that 2,640,000 of you good folks "out there" have now      bitten off at least a small corner of the quest we embarked      upon eight years ago.    </p>    <p>      But what kind of folks have you crawled into bed with      anyhow? Sure, you know why you read a publication with the      crazy name of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>' ... but what about the      other 2,639,999? Are they all "little old ladies in tennis      shoes"? Unwashed "dropouts"? Anti-this or anti-that nuts of      some kind? What sort of people read THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>'      anyway?    </p>    <p>      Well, we've been asking ourselves that same question. So we      recently had Don Bowdren Associates, a research      organization that specializes in such work, to conduct a      survey for us. We figured that we'd be able to do a much      better job of editing this magazine for you . . . if we      knew exactly who you are. (After all, the things that      vitally interest 20-year-old university students don't      necessarily interest 35-year-old back-to-the-landers or      72-year-old retirees.)    </p>    <p>      We found the results of that survey to be very interesting.      Because-no matter what the "dig we must, nuclear power is      inevitable, business as usual" vested interests may      claim-today's environmentalists (or at least MOTHER's share      of the growing crowd) are definitely not the unwashed,      unschooled, emotional, starry-eyed idealists who "would      rather save wildlife than jobs and don't understand the      real needs of our society anyway".    </p>    <p>      Quite the contrary. A scientific sampling of MOTHER's      audience (that's you!) shows you to be overwhelmingly well      schooled, well cultured, and levelheaded "backbones of your      community". And, although you most certainly do have a      genuine appreciation for many of the material goods that      our society offers . . . you also have the adult judgment      and maturity to forgo some of those same material goods      when you can see that such action is in the better interest      of the planet and unborn generations to come.    </p>  <h3> TO BE MORE SPECIFIC:</h3>    <p>      MOTHER's readers are 52% male, 48% female, and have a      median age of 32.6. You're 59% college educated, 18% of you      have done postgraduate work, and you have a median income      of $18,000 a year. Only 5.1 % of you live in households      which had total pre-tax 1976 incomes of less than $5,000      ... whereas a full 9.4% of you reside in households that      had total pre-tax 1976. incomes of $35,000 or more. (So      much for the quaint myth about the typical MOTHER reader      who lives in the woods and eats only berries.)    </p>    <p>      Some of you (4.9%) farm for a living, some of you (2.3%)      are students, some of you (13.7%) are craftsmen or -women,      some of you (9.7%) manage things, some of you (5.8%)      operate machines and work as unskilled laborers, and some      of you (3.7%) work in sales. Some of you do a lot of other      things. But the almost unbelievable fact about the      occupations of MOTHER's readers is that an incredible 35.9%      of you are professional, semi-professional, or technical      people ranging from chiropractors to college presidents to      musicians to surgeons to lawyers to dental technicians to      athletes to librarians to architects to physicists. In      general, you're a pretty clever bunch of individuals!    </p>    <p>      And you're just as clever around the house as you are on      the job. A full 86.7% of you spend an hour or more every      week (some, as much as 35 hours or more) working on home      improvements and repair projects. Arts and crafts also      engage 79.3% of you an hour or more every week and a      whopping 88.7% of you spend at least some time each week      furthering your education. You sew (58.9%), knit or crochet      (41.9%), do needlework (41.5%), do macrame (30.6%), quilt      (21.1%), make candies (18%), make rugs (15.6%), do ceramics      (14.8%), make jewelry (11.4%), and work leather (10.9%).      You personally change the oil in your vehicles (79%),      change the oil filter (77.5%), do minor tuneups (70.6%),      and handle your own car or truck suspension modifications      (22.7%).    </p>    <p>      An impressive 92.7% of MOTHER's subscribing households are      concerned by the presence of chemical additives andlor      preservatives in their food. And, not surprisingly, 86.3%      prefer "organically" grown foodstuffs. Which probably is      why 82.5% of you grow part of the food you eat, 86.2% of      you preserve some part of what you eat yourselves by      freezing, 62.5% of you preserve part of your food yourself      by canning, 21.8% by drying, 15.7% in a root cellar, and      8.4% of MOTHER's readers preserve at least some of the food      they eat by smoking it themselves.    </p>    <p>      TV viewing may be up substantially across the country .. .      but not for MOTHER's readers. In fact, 6.7% of you say that      you don't watch television at all, another 9% watch less      than an hour a week, 42.8% watch only one to seven hours a      week, 29.6% watch eight to 15 hours, 8.8% 15 to 25 hours,      only 1.8% watch 26 to 35 hours, and just 1.3% watch over 35      hours of TV a week.    </p>    <p>      Maybe that's because you read so much: 78.6% of you      purchased three or more (some, 50 or more) hard-cover books      during the past 12 months and 87.7% of you bought three or      more (again, some as many as 50 or more) paperbacks during      the same period.    </p>    <p>      Or maybe it's because you make a lot of your own      entertainment: 26.5% of you play the guitar, 25.8% the      piano, 12.8% the harmonica, 10.5% the organ, 10.2% the      recorder, 5.2% the clarinet, 2.9% the trumpet, 1.9% the      violin, and 16.5% some other musical instrument. Your      tastes, by the way, run to rock (44%), country (44%),      popular (39.2%), classical (33%), and other (31.4%) music.    </p>    <p>      Then again, maybe you don't watch much television because      you're too busy with your outdoor and sporting activities:      48.1 % of you hike, 41.3% camp, 40.1 % swim, 39% bicycle,      35.7% fish, 27% boat or canoe, 19.2% hunt, 17.1% play      tennis, 15.3% bowl, 13.8% ski, and 8.6% play golf.    </p>    <p>      Despite all these activities and despite the fact that you      certainly have the money for travel, you're real      homebodies: Only 23.3% of you hold valid passports and you      don't actually travel a great deal or move around as much      as you're "supposed" to in our modern mobile society. A      goodly percentage of you (76.4%) own your own home or      grounds and that property ranges in value from less than      $10,000 (4.5%) all the way up to $100,000 or more (6.3%).      The median value of your home and grounds, by the way, is      $39,600 and 14.6% of you live on a farm or ranch, 21.3% on      a rural homestead, 20.7% in the suburbs, 21.7% in a town or      village, and 22.2% in a city. A total of 45.7% of you own      one acre or more and 14% own 25 acres or more.    </p>    <p>      You own sewing machines (83.2%), blenders (79.8%), clothes      washers (77.3%), clothes dryers (67.1 %), freezers (52.5%),      chain saws (45.8%), dishwashers (39.2%), tillers (29.2%),      wood stoves (28.5%), juice extractors (17.4%), farm      tractors (13.3%), garden tractors (12.3%), and grain or      flour mills (10.2%). A few of you even have food      dehydrators (4.9%), cider presses (4.5%), and solar cookers      (0.7%). It's interesting, too, that 17.1 % of you have      added wood-burning stoves to your houses during the past      year, 1.3% have added solar panels, and 1.2% have installed      heat pumps.    </p>    <p>      Despite the fact that 93.6% of you MOTHER readers say that      environmental impact and gas consumption will be      considerations in the purchase of your next vehicle      you-like most folks living in today's society-are locked      into perhaps a greater dependency on the automobile than      you'd like: only 4.9% of you own no car at all, 32.2% have      one, 41 % two, 14.1 % three, and 7.8% four or more. This is      in addition to the fact that 40.4% of you own a pickup      truck, 10.8% a van, and 7% a 4-wheel-drive utility vehicle.      And even though you consume a lot of "organic" and "health"      foods, you do drink alcoholic beverages too: domestic beer      (63.8%), domestic wine (60.2%), imported wine (27.9%),      vodka (24.6%), bourbon (24.1 %), scotch (20.9%), rum      (17.7%), and so on. It should be noted, however, that 19.6%      of you do not drink at all.    </p>    <p>      Your favorite MOTHER features, in descending order, are      Energy Flashes, Country Lore, News From Mother, Bits and      Pieces, Dear Mother, Economic Outlook, Newsworthies,      Bootstrap Businesses, Swaps, Mother's Calendar, Profiles,      Successful Swaps, Last Laugh, Positions and Situations, and      Access. As a result of reading this magazine, 62.8% of you      are considering alternative sources of energy, 52% have      started or improved an organic garden, 50.7% have tried      recipes printed in MOTHER, 34.8% have investigated low-cost      construction ideas, 33.3% have tried a new art or craft,      and 30.9% have supported recycling programs.    </p>    <p>      In short: You're a well-educated, well-em. ployed, active,      intelligent, mature, trustworthy bunch of people who aren't      afraid to stand up and be counted when it comes to "odd"      things like alternative sources of energy, organic      gardening, and recycling. We're mighty pleased to know you      a little better and we're just awfully danged proud that      you read THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.    </p>	<hr />
