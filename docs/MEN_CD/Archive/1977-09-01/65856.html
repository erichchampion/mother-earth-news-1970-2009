                        <p>      <strong>Bette Hochberg springs from a long line of      Amish-Mennonite pioneers . . .folks who kept sheep, and      spun and wove their own wool as a matter of course. It's      little wonder, then, that Bette learned to spin early in      life.</strong>    </p>    <p>      But anyone at any age (you, for instance!) who has the will      and the patience can learn to handspin. And you won't even      need a spinning wheel: A handspindle will do for starters.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Hochberg's book, Handspinner's Handbook (from which      the following excerpts were chosen), gives simple      directions for handling 20 different fibers and for      becoming a fast, competent spinner. You have only to follow      her instructions to see why the ancient craft of      handspinning is far from obsolete, to find-as Bette      says-the "great pleasure and satisfaction" that come from      "reenacting an activity that's been a part of human life      from the beginning".    </p>    <p>      People have been spinning for at least 7,000 years. The      earliest archaeological finds of yarns were in the valley      of the Nile. These were linen-like fibers, and early      Egyptian wall paintings show the preparation and spinning      of flax into linen. About 6,000 years ago in Babylonia and      Mesopotamia, sheep were domesticated and wool was spun and      traded. For 5,000 years cotton has been grown and spun.      China began its silk industry about 2500 B.C. These four      fibers-linen, wool, cotton, silksupplied most of man's      needs for cloth through the ages.    </p>    <p>      Spinning is holding a mass of fibers and twisting a few of      them as they are pulled from the loose mass. The rhythm is,      "First twist, then pull."    </p>    <p>      You can spin almost anything that is long, thin, and      flexible . . . the hair of many animals and the fibers of      many plants. It's even possible to sit in the woods and      spin dry grasses without any tools. This is fun, butwhile      learning-stay with the fibers that people have spun for      centuries.    </p>    <h3>      THE HANDSPINDLE    </h3>    <p>      The first form of spinning was twisting by hand, or "thigh      spinning". This is still done today by the Chilkat Indians.      Then spinners discovered the handspindle: a stick with a      weight which spins like a top. As the spindle revolves, the      yarn twists, and is then wound around the shaft. Of the      7,000 years that we have known how to spin, almost 6,500      years were spent with only the handspindle.    </p>    <p>      There are many sizes and styles of handspindles: little      needle-like slivers of bamboo weighted with tiny beads of      clay, and the long-shafted Navajo spindle with plate-like      wooden whorls. It is possible to spin a finer thread on a      handspindle than on a wheel. The Dacca muslins of India are      woven of spindlespun cotton so fine it measures 250 miles      to a pound. Many cultures around the world still use hand      spindles. (Editor's note: See Mrs. Hochberg's second book,      Handspindles, an instruction manual for this kind of      spining.)    </p>    <h3>      THE SPINNING WHEEL    </h3>    <p>      The- spinning wheel evolved from the handspindle. The      earliest wheels were simply a long-shafted handspindle with      the whorl suspended horizontally between two vertical      posts. A cord encircled the spindle whorl and a larger      wheel. Each time the large wheel revolved one turn, the      little whorl revolved many turns. The spinner turned the      large wheel with one hand and spun the yarn with the other      hand, winding the strand on the spindle shaft. This style      was used for centuries in the Orient, and was introduced to      the West about 1400.    </p>    <p>      By 1480 the flyer was in use. The flyer holds a bobbin on      its center shaft. The two revolve at different speeds and      thus the yarn winds on as it is spun.    </p>    <h3>      THE "LONG DRAW" METHOD    </h3>    <p>      One often sees spinners hovering over the orifice of the      wheel and working equally with their two hands, pulling out      fibers with one hand and drawing back with the other. I      call this the "push-pull" method. This is an easy way to      teach beginners to spin, but you cannot become a good,      fast, and uniform spinner using this method. Your left hand      cannot consistently pull out the same amount of fiber, and      it is necessarily a slow process that cannot be speeded up.      Hobby spinners and craft books have been perpetuating this      awkward and inefficient technique.    </p>    <p>      Once you become adept at the "long draw", you'll be      treadling as rapidly as is comfortable, and drawing your      arm back in a long sweep. Your arm will move back, keeping      just enough ahead of the twist to allow free drawing out of      the fibers in your right hand. This method is smooth,      rhythmic, and rapid and the only feasible way to spin      short-staple fibers such as cotton, cashmere, and camel      down. I spin all fibers this way, except line and      extra-thick yarn. I can spin a pound an hour of wool,      linen, or mohair on a Saxony wheel.    </p>    <h3>      A GOOD PLACE TO SIT    </h3>    <p>      Your wheel should sit on the hard bare floor. (If you have      carpeting, it will help to put a square of plywood under      the wheel.) If your wheel is on a spongy surface, this puts      a strain on the structure of the wheel, and makes treadling      more difficult.    </p>    <p>      Don't slouch on a couch or soft arm chair. Find a stable,      backless stool. Try a kitchen stool, a piano stool, or even      a small barrel. Stand beside the stool barefoot. If the top      of the stool is even with the bottom of your kneecap, it's      about the right height. It will likely be between 17 and 18      inches. Sit close to the wheel and to the left of center.      With good posture you'll tire less quickly.    </p>    <p>      When you're spinning wool "in the grease", it's nice to sit      in the sun or by the fire. The heat warms the lanolin and      the fibers will draw out more easily. Never leave your      wheel sitting in a hot place any longer than necessary. If      you leave your wheel by a sunny window. the heat will dry      out the wood and sometimes crack it. If the wood has an oil      finish, re-oil it often.    </p>    <h3>      THE STARTING CORD AND THREADING HOOK    </h3>    <p>      Take a piece of string about two feet long (a fuzzy, hairy      wool yarn works best). Tie one end firmly around the center      core of the bobbin and wind it around three or four times.      Now you'll need a threading hook. If your wheel doesn't      have one, a crochet hook will work, or a bent paper clip.      (I took a three-inch length of fancy turned dowel and      inserted half a large paper clip into one end.) Take the      end of your starting cord and pass it around the hooks on      one side of your flyer, and hold it with your left hand      over the eye on top of the spindle shaft. With the      threading hook in your right hand, reach into the orifice,      and use the hook to bring the end of the starting cord down      through the eye and out of the orifice. It sometimes helps      beginners to tie a small knot an inch or two from the end      of the starting cord. (This makes it easier for the      spinning fiber to catch onto it.)    </p>    <h3>      THE DRAWING-OUT TRIANGLE    </h3>    <p>      You must learn to observe what happens in the area where      the fibers are being drawn out of the mass and twisted.      This area usually assumes a somewhat triangular shape. The      triangle must be long enough to allow the individual fibers      to slide freely past each other as they're being drawn into      the twist. So the length of the triangle will change when      you change from one fiber to another. The number of fibers      that are in the triangle at any moment determines the      thickness of that portion of yarn.    </p>    <h3>      BEGINNING TO SPIN    </h3>    <p>      Carded wool "in the grease" is probably the easiest fiber      for beginners, because "dirty" fibers are more cohesive      than "clean" fibers. Try to begin with a staple not more      than three or four inches long Hold a comfortable handful      (or a rolag) it your right hand. Loosen a small tuft of the      mass and lay the starting cord over itoverlapping two or      three inches-and pinch this length lightly between the      thumb and forefinger of your left hand.    </p>    <p>      Start treadling your wheel slowly clock wise. Watch the      twist running up the start ing cord. You can feel when it      reaches your thumb and forefinger. At that instant you can      both see and feel the fibers catch or the starting cord.      Continue to hold the "caught" area between the thumb and      forefinger. Treadle five or six times, and stop. Draw your      right hand back as you re lease the accumulated twist held      by your left hand. Watch the twist run up toward your right      hand. Practice this, step by step, keeping your eye on the      drawing-out triangle.    </p>    <p>      When you feel confident about each stage, begin to maintain      a slow, continu ous treadling, as your right hand move:      backward as fast as the twist runs toward it. Your right      hand can make a long sweeping continuous draw until it      reaches arm's length.    </p>    <p>      To let the yarn wind on, move your right arm forward in a      sweeping motion toward the orifice. Allow it to wind on as      fast as possible while still maintaining enough tension to      keep the thread straight, not slack. Twist will only run up      a taut thread.    </p>    <p>      At first you'll need to use your left thumb and forefinger      to control the twist and tension a bit, but don't hang on      to the yarn as a security blanket. Consciously try to give      that left hand less and less to do as you practice. It      should be held near the orifice just to guide and smooth      the yarn (I rarely use my left hand, unless I'm spin ning a      very thick yarn. Then I use it to as sist the tug from the      wheel, and to pull out any lumps.) Left-handed people can      re verse these directions.    </p>    <p>      If your yarn breaks, you'll need to join the two ends. The      ends will not join if they're tapered and look like this:    </p>        <p>      You must fan out the fibers until they look like this:    </p>        <p>      Then overlap the fanned-out ends and hold them between your      thumb and forefinger. Treadle until the twist joins them.      With a little practice you can make a good join that can't      be seen.    </p>    <h3>      SKEINING SPUN YARN    </h3>    <p>      The simplest way to make a skein of yarn is to wind it by      encircling your elbow and the "V" between your thumb and      forefinger. However, this method doesn't allow for accurate      measuring of yardage. The handiest way to make a skein is      with a niddynoddy (a stick for winding and measuring yarn).      You can buy one, or make one with dowels.    </p>        <p>      If you make your own niddy-noddy, be sure that the cross      arms that go through the center shaft are set perpendicular      to each other. The arms are set 18 inches apart to make a      skein a yard long (two yards around). You can measure      yardage and weigh skeins to calculate :-e -_of yards for      weaving, etc.    </p>    <p>      If you free the string from around the bobbin groove, you      can wind off directly from the bobbin on the spindle shaft      onto the niddy-noddy. Or many wheels have a built-on bobbin      rack, so you can store several bobbins, and then wind off.      If your wheel doesn't have a bobbin rack you can buy or      make one.    </p>    <p>      Hold the niddy-noddy in the center with your left hand, and      tuck the end of the yarn under your left thumb. Wind around      as shown, to form two V-shapes. Use the yarn ends to tie a      double half hitch around each end of the skein. Slip it off      the niddy-noddy and onto your forefingers. Rotate the right      forefinger clockwise and the left forefinger      counterclockwise, to twist the skein tightly. Put one end      through the loop at the other end and it will twist itself      into the position shown.    </p>    <h3>      SETTING THE TWIST    </h3>    <p>      If your yarn was spun from "fleece in the grease" or other      "dirty" fibers, make suds in lukewarm water and wash the      skein as you would a sweater, then rinse in water the same      temperature. If the fibers you spun were clean, just dip      the skein in lukewarm water. A dash of vinegar or lemon      juice in the rinse water will make hair fibers shine.      Fabric softener or hair creme rinse in the rinse water will      give a nice feel to wool and down fibers. Vegetable fibers      should be dipped in clear water.    </p>    <p>      To hang the skeins and set the twist, I use "S" hooks from      the hardware, and lead fishing weights sold by the ounce.      Always remove the weight as soon as the twist is set or the      yarn is dry, so it doesn't deaden the resilience of the      yarn. The amount of weight should be greater than that of      the yarn. For instance, a fourounce skein should have at      least a sixounce weight.    </p>        <p><strong>      A. WHEEL</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>      B.
