        <hr /><p>Anybody who's done any carpenter work at all knows the value of a good t apron for keeping nails, screws, to measure, hammer, square, and other items separate and accessible. "It's se less to spend $2.00, $4.00, or more on storebought work apron, however," s Bull Wilson of La Mesa, California, "when you can make a perfectly serviceable o yourself . . . for nothingl" Bull's secret? fabricates his work aprons from-y , guessed it--wornout blue jeans. Here, how:</p><p>STEP 1: Cut the legs off a snug-fittf pair of old Levi's, the same as you would ` do to make shorts. (See Fig. 1.)</p><p>STEP 2: Cut along the leg seams and r move the front half of the "shorts", b leave the waistband intact (Fig. 2). Al remove (and save) the belt loops.</p><p>STEP 3: Hem the apron's edges a patch any holes that might exist in t former jeans' back pockets. Sew a coup pairs of belt loops together edgewise, to them to one or both sides of the apron act as hammer (or square) holders . . . a you're done! (See Fig. 3.)</p><p>Linda Brock (wife of MOTHER staff Travis Brock) made a blue denim t apron (see photo) from Bull Wilson's in structions not long ago . . . and we c vouch for its serviceability. Fact is, we' even go so far as to say that if there's dandier way to keep tools and nails order while doing carpentry work . . . haven't seen it!</p><hr />
