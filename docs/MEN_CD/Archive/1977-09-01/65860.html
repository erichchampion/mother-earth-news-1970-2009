    <p>
                        <p>      <strong>You say you'd like to be able to work part time-and      you'd like to be able to leave the house during the daybut      you don't have any "marketable skills" ... you don't want a      clerical job ... and anyway, you can't leave the children      at home unattended? Don't give up yet . . . not until      you've read what Andee Carlsson has to say!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Finding yourself without any funds in the middle of a      northern Idaho winter can be pretty inconvenient . . . take      it from me. When we ran out of money a couple of winters      ago, unemployment here was disconcertingly high, and what      few jobs there were (particularly for women) usually paid      only the minimum wage. To make matters worse, we lived 30      miles from the nearest small town, and a full 65 miles from      Spokane, Washington (where the best employment      opportunities were).    </p>        <p>      There were other considerations, too. My son-at the      time-was three years old and I didn't want to be away from      him all day . . . besides which, I couldn't stand the idea      of working more than part time anyhow (since there are      plenty of chores to do-even in the winter-on our 80-acre      homestead). Another problem was that, after eight years in      the country, I didn't have any clothes suitable for a city      job (nor did 1 particularly want to buy any).    </p>    <p>      By far the biggest complicating factor, however, was simply      that I never have cared for the routine of a nine-to-five      job ... and still don't. (Let's just say I get bored      easily.) That ruled out the majority of job openings for      which I might have qualified.    </p>    <h3>      A SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE SOLUTION    </h3>    <p>      After pondering the situation for a few days, I had a      sudden brainstorm: "I'll bet I could get some weekly      housecleaning jobs in town," I said to myself. Sure . . .      why not? My parents had a "cleaning lady" when I was a      child, and the work looked simple enough. If I went into      the cleaning business, I could wear ordinary jeans and      sneakers (no need for fancy clothes) ... and quite      possibly, I could work things out so that I could bring      Erik (my son) along with me.    </p>    <p>      The more I thought about it, the more the idea of      housecleaning made sense. The pay-1 was almost sure-would      be better than minimum wage. Also, if I found three      different houses to clean on a regular basis, I wouldn't be      as bored as I would if I were going to the same place every      day. And if I took the jobs in Spokane-where some      acquaintances live-I might even be able to stay overnight      with my friends, and not have to commute 130 miles each      day.    </p>    <p>      "That's it," I decided. "I'm going to try my hand at      housecleaning for profit!"    </p>    <h3>      HOW I ADVERTISED MY SERVICES    </h3>        <p>      Right away, 1 went into Spokane to try to get some jobs set      up. I wasn't really sure I could pull it off (for one      thing, 1 was inexperienced . . . and for another, I didn't      know if I'd be able to do a good day's work with Erik      along), but I at least wanted to give the housecleaning      idea a try.    </p>    <p>      Initially, I couldn't decide whether to post notices on      supermarket bulletin boards or run an ad in the classified      sec tion of the city paper. It so happened however, that      the Spokane paper had bargain rate for job-seekers: $2.85      for r 10word ad for five days (if I placed the ac in person      and if I paid in cash). The price seemed right to me-and I      knew the news paper would reach far more people than      bulletin board notices-so I went down to the newspaper      office to inquire about running a 10-word ad.    </p>    <p>      The lady who waited on me helped me write the announcement.      It read: "Experi enced woman wants weekly cleaning jobs.      Reliable. References. 223-4456.' One of the things the      newspaper lady stressed was that an ad with a phone number      in it would bring many more re sponses than one with just      an address. She suggested, in fact, that I use a friend's      number-if necessaryand have the friend take messages,      rather than use only an address in the ad. And that's what      I finally did.    </p>    <h3>      LAST-MINUTE DETAILS    </h3>        <p>      I had a few details to take care of before my ad actually      started to run. First. I called two friends and asked them      if they'd serve as "references". They agreed. and said they      would tell potential employers that I was honest, reliable,      and a hard worker. (As it later turned out, only one      prospective employer wanted me to give references, and she      never did call either of my friends. I still think it's a      good idea to have some recommendations, though. After all,      your employers are opening their homes to you, and in most      cases you're alone there all day . . . so they're entitled      to have some proof of your trustworthiness.)    </p>    <p>      Next, I called the State Employment Agency to ask how much      money cleaning ladies usually earned. They said they      "thought" the rate was about $2.50 an hour. That seemed a      little low to me, so I called two women I knew whom I      thought might have had help in their homes ... and they      told me $3.00 an hour. Finally, with some encouragement      from my friends, I decided to ask $3.50 an hour to start.      (I could always lower my price if it was too high, I      reasoned.) As it turned out, my price didn't raise any      eyebrows and I ended up feeling glad that I held out for      what seemed to be more than the going rate. (It's always      easier to start out high than to ask for a raise.)    </p>    <p>      At this time, I also made a few decitions I wanted. I      decided, for instance, that it was important that no one be      home during the day. (I don't like having people look over      my shoulder while I'm working. Also. I like to work at my      own pace and not have to worry about when-and how often -I      should take breaks.) And, of course, my employer(s) had to      be willing to let me bring Erik along . . . otherwise I'd      have to refuse the job(s).    </p>    <h3>     THE PHONE CALLS START COMING    </h3>        <p>      I'll have to admit that for a while, the night before my ad      was to appear in the caper, I was a little worried that no      one would answer my announcement. My fears proved totally      groundless, however: The first call came at 7:00 a.m. the      day the ad was printed . . . and for the next five days,      the phone never stopped ringing! (Altogether, I answered      some 65 calls!)    </p>    <p>      Usually, the callers wanted to know how old I was, whether      I had my own transportation (I did), and what day of the      week I could work. If they asked whether I was      "experienced", 1 confidently said "yes". (I figured that 14      years as a housewife was experience enough.)    </p>    <p>      When it appeared that the caller was genuinely interested      in hiring me, I began asking my own questions. For example,      I asked who-if anyone-would be home during the day, what      the house was like, and whether it was all right for Erik      to come. By the time I'd answered the first 10 calls, I had      three one-day-a-week jobs lined up ... in homes where Erik      and I would be the only ones there all day. (None of my      three "employers" wanted to interview me in person. They      just wanted me to show up for work the next week!)    </p>    <p>      Although three one-day jobs was all I wanted, I continued      to take calls for several days and wrote down the names and      numbers of families that sounded promising, just in case      any of my three agreed-to jobs fell through. As it turned      out, it was a good thing I did this . . . because (for      reasons I won't go into here) I did end up turning down one      of my original three jobs. Fortunately. I was able to call      back one of the families on my "promising households" list      and replace the dropped account immediately    </p>    <h3>      MY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB    </h3><p>I don't mind saying that I was kind of scared when I    arrived at my first house for my first day of work. I got    there a few minutes early, and so had a chance to look the    place over. It was a doctor's home and it was-in a word-huge:    five baths, ten bedrooms, and eight other rooms. 11 was    thankful that I was only expected to clean the first floor!)</p>    <p>      The woman who met me at the door (a Mrs. O'Neill) was very      friendly and offered me a cup of coffee while she explained      what she wanted done. She had written down on a piece of      paper which rooms she wanted me to clean and what she      wanted me to do in each room. After discussing the list of      items-to-be-cleaned, she showed me where the cleaning      equipment was and left to go to work.    </p>    <p>      I stood there for a minute, feeling overwhelmed by the two      vacuums, one floor polisher, one floor scrubber. and about      fifty different kinds of cleansers. Fortunately for me,      Mrs. O'Neill's list included very explicit instructions for      what kind of cleaners were to be used where . . . sowith      list in hand-I started in.    </p>    <p>      Later that day, Mrs. O'Neill came home for lunch, and I had      an opportunity to ask several questions that had occurred      to me in the morning. She didn't seem to mind the questions      at all . . . in fact, I think she appreciated my trying to      do things the way she wanted them done. (On future      occasions, if I had a question I would leave a note, and      she would leave me notes, too. I also mentioned on my notes      which cleansers needed to be replaced.)    </p>    <p>      That first day, it took me the whole eight hours to get the      job done, working at full speed. After a couple of weeks,      though, I got things organized to the point where I could      work at a fairly leisurely pace. The nice part was that I      got paid each day I worked . . .    </p>    <h3>      THE ROUTINEx    </h3>        <p>      It turned out that at all three houses I performed      basically the same chores. In one room after another, I      dusted all the surfaces (including over the doors and      windows, and the tops of the baseboards) . . . vacuumed the      floors and rugs and the upholstered furniture . . . waxed      and wiped the woodwork . . . washed the windows (if they      needed it) ... and emptied the wastebaskets. Also-in the      -kitchen and bathrooms-the floors had to be vacuumed,      scrubbed, and waxed. (Luckily, each home had a dishwasher      and I never had to do any dishes.)    </p>    <p>      My usual practice (since I'm a fairly fast worker) was to      work hard for a couple of hours, then take a break. If one      task got to be too irritating or boring, I'd go do      something else and then come back to it later. Also, I made      a point of finishing the room I was working on before      starting on another room (since-that way-1 kept to a      minimum the number of times I had to carry all the cleaning      supplies from one place to another).    </p>    <h3>      SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES    </h3>    <p>My new job brought with it some nice fringe benefits ...    things I hadn't expected. For instance, I always got a very    nice lunch at each of the houses where I worked. (Typically,    I'd sit down to roast beef, turkey, or ham sandwiches, and    perhaps a fruit salad. "Eat whatever looks good," I was told    . . . and I did.) Also, all three of my employers offered me    items to take home: clothes for my husband, canning jars,    fruit from their trees, etc. (The best goodies I was ever    offered were 15 feet of rabbitcage fencing and a 40pound box    of garden asparagus.)</p>    <p>      The nicest part of housecleaning for me, however, was the      casualness of it all. My "uniform" included jeans and      tennies . . . I took breaks whenever I wanted . . . I even      watched TV sometimes as I worked.    </p>    <h3>      THE "DAY CARE" ASPECT    </h3><p>It was also nice being able to bring Erik with me    whenever I wanted to, although my son actually only came with    me a few times during the midwinter-to-early-summer period in    which I did housecleaning on a regular basis. (Erik decided    it was more fun to stay home with Daddy.) Those times that he    did tag along, everything worked out just fine Erik would    play with his toys, or just watch TV (which was a novelty for    him since we don't have a set). I did, of course, have to    keep him right with me at all times (although he knew that he    was not to touch fragile objects in other people's houses).</p>    <p>      Overall, I found it easier to work without Erik present .      ., but the knowledge that my son could come with me if he      wanted to made things a lot nicer for both of us.    </p>    <h3>      MONEY MATTERS    </h3><p>Financially, housecleaning worked out quite well for me.    I was paid $28 cash each day I worked (that's $3.50 an hour    times eight hours), and I worked three days a week, for a    weekly gross income of $84. I figured it cost me about $10 a    week (or 8d a mile) to drive into Spokane and back. Since I    had no expenses other 1han transportation (I spent the two    nights a week that I was in town at a friend's house and paid    for my room and board with eggs, milk, and vegetables from    home), that meant that I cleared $75 per week, or $300 per    month. Not bad for a three-days-a week job that requires no    special skills, no real prior experience, and no fancy    clothes!</p>    <h3>      ANOTHER BENEFIT    </h3><p>Iin addition to the $300 a month I earned, my working in    town presented me with another benefit: It gave me a new    appreciation for country life. (After eight years in the    country. I'd forgotten how much I disliked the city.) Not    that I didn't have a little fun in town now and then. 1 did:    1 went to some yard sales and picked up some real bargains (a    cider press, for example) and also had time to scrounge    pickup-loads of mill-ends for the kitchen stove, greens for    our rabbits and chickens, and miles of plastic sheeting.    Always, however, I came away from the city with a new    enthusiasm for our homestead . . . and for my son.</p>    <h3>      TRY IT. . .YOU MIGHT LIKE IT    </h3>        <p>      So housecleaning was fun and profitable for me. I made      reasonably good money ($3.50/hour), set my own working      conditions, wore comfortable clothes, and worked at my own      (rather leisurely) pace. I'd still be cleaning houses      today, if it weren't for the fact that I no longer have      time for all my homestead chores and working too.    </p>    <p>      Housecleaning isn't the most fascinating occupation in the      world, to be sure. It's certainly better than a lot of      other jobs, though. At the very least, however, as a      freelance cleaning person you get to call the shots. And to      me (maybe to you, too), that's what raallv matters.    </p>    <hr />
