        <p>Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy (BICEP) is a new coalition of companies that are flexing their collective muscle to push for climate change legislation. Launched in November 2008, BICEP includes international powerhouses such as Starbucks, Nike and Levi Strauss.</p><p>Though from diverse realms of the business world, BICEP members are united by the concern about the economic effects of global warming, specifically, that global warming poses grave risks to their supplies and operations. Many of the companies depend on agricultural products - coffee for Starbucks, cotton for Levi Strauss - that are threatened by the changing weather patterns caused by global warming.</p><p>The group’s goal is to bring business leaders into the national discussion of climate change, and BICEP is muscling a green agenda: Cut greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and establish an economy-wide cap on greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Visit the <a href="http://www.ceres.org/bicep" target="_blank">BICEP website</a> to learn more about the organization, its members and its initiatives.</p>
