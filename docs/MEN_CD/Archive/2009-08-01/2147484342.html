        <p>While we were going through our wedding cards, it dawned on me that I could reuse them for scrapbooking supplies. In addition to the lovely pictures, some of the cards had poems inside that I could cut out. Some even had a vellum layer that could be carefully taken off and reused.</p><p>All of this can be done with birthday, graduation and holiday cards as well.</p><h5>Jessica Cadeau<br />Newberry, Michigan</h5><p><em>Recycled cards also make great gift tags. - MOTHER</em></p>
