        <p>Two years ago, after a tornado destroyed nearly the entire town of Greensburg, Kan., residents decided that they would not only rebuild, they would redesign the town to be a model green community.</p><p>The nonprofit organization Greensburg GreenTown is building eco-homes (12 total) as a “living laboratory” of green design. Each home will showcase different building techniques and provide opportunities for visitors to learn about green building firsthand.</p><p>The first home, to be completed this summer, is called the Silo Eco-Home. It will serve as the organization’s office, and will provide space for demonstrations and overnight stays for visitors. The building is a 2,000-square-foot single-family home, with a 2-kilowatt solar-electric system, a cistern for rainwater harvesting, passive ventilation and water-saving technology. The concrete in the walls and roof will be made with crushed concrete recycled from the storm wreckage, making the structure strong enough to survive nearly any storm.</p><p>Learn more at the <a href="http://www.greensburggreentown.org/" target="_blank">Greensburg GreenTown</a> website.</p>
