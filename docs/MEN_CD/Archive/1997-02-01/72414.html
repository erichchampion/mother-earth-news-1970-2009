    <p>
                <p>      <strong>Spring Garden Special</strong>    </p>            <p>      As a gardener in the public eye-I am a past president      of the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association; I      have taught gardening classes, A lectured, and written a      gardening column for the past 25 years-I get asked a      lot of gardening questions. The subject I am asked about      most often is insects. The question from experienced      gardeners is usually: "What do you do about (fill in the      name of an insect)?" A beginning gardener ends the question      with something like: ". ..what about those green worms on      broccoli?"    </p>    <p>      My simple answer is usually not very satisfying to the      questioner. "Nothing." But, hey, it's better than the      answer you will get from a doctor you run into on the      street if you ask about a medical problem. I didn't say,      "See me in my office." I actually answered the question      honestly. Well, mostly.    </p>        <p>      I remember attending a lecture on economics given by Scott      Nearing. Several hundred back-to-the-landers were gathered      at Common Ground Country Fair to hear their mentor give a      talk on economics. He stepped to the podium, arranged his      papers before him, and looked out at the gathered crowd. "I      am going to tell you all you need to know about economics,"      he said. He looked down at his papers and then back at the      crowd. "Pay as you go." He gathered his papers and sat      down.    </p>    <p>      That was such a memorable speech that I have been trying to      duplicate it. I can tell you all you need to know about      insects that damage crops in the garden: "Grow healthy      plants in a healthy soil."    </p>    <p>      Scott returned to the podium with his wife, Helen. They      answered questions about homesteading, maple sugaring,      building stone houses and walls, gardening, and Living the      Good Life. I will come back to the podium and talk about      insects I have known.    </p>    <p>      What do I do about insects that damage crops? I observe      them (primary research). I identify them and do a little      secondary (book) research. And then I wait to see if the      damage is significant enough to justify concern. When I say      I do nothing, and that isn't always my response, I mean      that I do nothing to interrupt the life cycle of the      insect-no spraying, no picking, no sticking, no      luring, or zapping.    </p>        <p>      Some will say that is all well and good for people living      in Maine and simi lar climates, because the insects are      killed in the winter. I am not going to argue the point. I      am going to be specific about the insects that eat or have      eaten vegetables in my Maine garden. People can draw their      own conclusions.    </p>    <p>      Insects do significant damage to apples and pears that I      have tried to grow. I have not tried very hard to grow      fruit crops so I can't say with confidence that the      philosophy and methods I use for vegetables will work for      fruit. Be assured that I will not give up on the philosophy      until I have done everything I can think of to make it      work. Even then I may conclude that I just haven't found      the key, rather than that the philosophy is flawed.    </p>    <p>      The philosophy is that healthy plants do not attract insect      "pests." Think of insects that damage crops as indicators      that a plant is not healthy rather than as pests. Their job      is to clear away poor-quality living things so that general      health will prevail.    </p>    <p>      One of my favorite examples of this happened in my second      garden. I planted four rows of turnips. Don't ask me why I      planted so man) turnips. It was just one of those things. I      guess there were enough seeds in the packet. Whatever. The      plants were looking beautiful, until one day when I noticed      some of them were wilting. I looked more closely and found      the stems of the plants were covered with black aphids.      They were infested.    </p>        <p>      I couldn't believe it. Since I didn't know what to do and      didn't think I would miss the turnips anyway, I did      nothing. The result was a mystery that puzzled me for      several years. The aphids did not destroy all the plants.      They got the plants they were covering; but as the attacked      plants got weaker and weaker, I noticed that the plants at      the ends of the rows were fine. Here were four 25-foot rows      of turnips in which the center section of all four rows had      been basically annihilated, while about four feet on either      end of the rows were left virtually untouched.    </p>    <p>      It was three years later when I was working on      illustrations for my book that I came upon an explanation      to the mystery that suits me. The illustrations were garden      plots for each year drawn to scale and placed on the paper      in the same relationship one year to another. I found that      the turnip rows of the second garden crossed the corn patch      of the first garden. The aphids had destroyed the turnips      that were growing in soil that had hosted corn the year      before. Rows of other vegetables crossed the corn patch      without incident. The turnips did fine in ground previously      inhabited by beans, beets, lettuce, and potatoes. My      non-scientific conclusion was that the corn took something      from the soil that I did not replace and that the turnips      needed.    </p>        <p>      There have been scientific studies conducted that support      the claim that insects attack plants that are not receiving      a proper balance of nutrients. There have also been more      examples in my garden over the years.    </p>    <p>      The principal things that I do to protect my crops from      insects are rotating the crops, maintaining a high level of      humus by adding some bulk organic material every year, and      changing the bulk material every so often (horse manure      with shavings, chicken manure or seaweed, hay, leaves,      etc.). A soil test every other year or so also helps keep      me on track.    </p>    <p>      The probable reason I did nothing about aphids was that I      realized I had planted too many turnips, especially since      they are not a favorite vegetable of mine. In subsequent      years, I have found aphids on nasturtiums. The irony is      that the nasturtiums were planted to repel aphids. I won't      mention any of the books that recommend that, but I came to      the conclusion that nasturtiums would be better listed as a      catch crop for the aphids. Planting crops for the purpose      of repelling or attracting insects is called companion      planting. Nasturtiums, marigolds, and aromatic plants are      generally mentioned in this regard. Frankly, I am not a      great fan of companion planting. It doesn't do any harm and      it may do some good, but when you see nasturtiums or      marigolds in my vegetable garden it is because they are      pretty kind of nice to have around.    </p>        <p>      What do I do about aphids? I haven't no ticed any in my      garden since 1974. For some this is just one of those      mysteries of organic agriculture. Clearly aphids can      destroy crops in Maine-more specifically, in my      garden. Yet they were only here in my second and third      garden.    </p>    <p>      What I recommend for anyone who has a problem with aphids      is an immediate soil test. Get humus in the soil. Get the      soil nutrients balanced. Use this indication of a soil      problem to improve the health of the garden for next year.    </p>    <p>      The first insect to cause me to panic was the cabbage worm      or cabbage looper. These are two different insects, but the      difference is of no value other than to make gardeners who      know the difference feel superior to gardeners who don't.      At the time of my first encounter, I didn't know the      difference.    </p>    <p>      I should back up a bit. I did not grow cabbage or any      members of the cabbage family in my first garden. Potatoes,      corn, onions, cucumbers, zucchini, tomatoes, green beans,      peas, spinach, beets, lettuce, and radishes all flourished      without any insect damage. The reason, of course, was my      purity. Perhaps luck in starting on fertile soil and in a      place where no garden crops had been for several years had      something to do with it, too. But when you are young and      pure and self-righteous ...well, I'm afraid I did not hide      my light under a bushel basket that winter. Several more      experienced growers with whom I came in contact asked what      I had done about cabbage worms. When they found that I      hadn't grown any of the crops that attract this green      fellow they just gave me a superior smile.    </p>        <p>      I was sure my methods would work for any crop. Cabbage,      cauliflower, and broccoli were planned for the next garden.      One of the controls you may come across when reading about      pest control is separating crops of the same family.      Insects that feed on one member of the family, say      potatoes, may also feed on other members of the same      family, tomatoes or eggplant, for example. The idea is to      make it difficult for insects to crawl from one crop to      another. I have observed a lot of insects and, with the      possible exception of the tomato horn worm, I have never      been able to detect insects moving from one plant to      another. My insects stay with the host upon which they were      hatched.    </p>    <p>      Nor have I seen anything that would lead me to believe that      a larger patch of one family is more likely to attract      insects in flight than an individual plant. Flying insects      get around and investigate just about everything that might      be of interest to them. Do you think you are more likely to      be bitten by a mosquito when you are in a crowd than when      you are alone?    </p>    <p>      I planted these three brassicas (mem bers of the cabbage      family) next to each other. I planted them next to the      central garden path and close to the house where I could      keep an eye on them. And, lo, it came to pass that dark      green balls similar in size and color to capers appeared in      the center of the cabbage plants just as they started to      form heads. Upon close inspection, worms were discovered,      and they were eating the leaves of my cabbage plant. In a      panic I rushed to the Agway store for some Rotenone.      Rotenone is a poison that is derived from plants. It does      not hang around in the soil long and therefore poses no      problem through accumulation. It is, however, a contact      poison. It kills most insects with which it comes in      contact.    </p>        <p>      My trip to buy this poison sobered me somewhat. By the time      I got home I had decided to use it on only half of the      plants. I would leave the rest for observation. Once in the      garden with the Rotenone I decided to dust only a third of      the plants. I ended up dusting a fourth of them. I hated      it. I wasn't wearing breathing apparatus or protective      clothing as should be worn. I got a taste in the back of my      mouth that was like sucking on pennies. Not pleasant. After      the deed, I changed my clothes and showered but still felt      contaminated. That was the first and last time I ever used      a poison in my garden. Natural or not, acceptable by      organic standards or not, it is not for me.    </p>    <p>      This decision was not based entirely on my dislike of the      poison and my role. If Rotenone were the only way I could      grow cabbage and get it to a harvestable stage, I would      probably use it. That first year I harvested all of the      cabbage I had planted. Threefourths of them had been left      mostly to their own devices. I may have hand- picked a few      worms. Who could resist? If I can get cabbage that pleases      me without using poisons, then why use poisons?    </p>    <p>      The cabbage looper-for those of you who want to feel      superior-has front and back legs and loops into an      omega shape when it travels. The cabbage worm has legs all      along its body and moves flat against the leaves. Just to      confuse you, they are both caterpillars.    </p>        <p>      "The cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni. A native caterpillar      common throughout the country. It attacks all members of      the cabbage family-broccoli, Brussels sprouts,      cabbage, cauliflower, collards, horse-radish, kale,      kohlrabi, mustard, radish, turnip-and also feeds on      beet, celery, lettuce, parsley, pea, potato, spinach,      tomato; and on flowers-carnation, chrysanthemum,      mignonette, geranium, and others. The looper is said to be      a serious lettuce pest. It winters as a green-to-brown pupa      wrapped in a cocoon attached by one side to a plant leaf,      and transforms in spring into a moth with mottled brownish      fore wings, with a small silvery spot in the middle, and      paler brown hind wings. Wing expanse is just under 1 1/2      inches." That is from <em>The Gardener's Bug Book,</em> by      Cynthia Westcott. It goes on to give more information about      the insects and some methods of control. I have several      insect identification books, but this is my favorite. Her      chemical control methods are of no use to me, but she does      include natural methods when they make sense to her.      Control that I like is usually based on knowing the insect      well, and she gives me the information I need.    </p>        <p>      As for the cabbage caterpillars, I usually just pick them      off if I feel like it or let them eat. Picking them from      cabbage is difficult be cause they are hard to see. When      the sun is low in the sky you can sometimes see them better      using the sun to "x-ray" the leaves.    </p>    <p>      Despite the wonderful list of vegetables Cynthia says they      will "attack" and the fact that I grow most of these, and      despite the fact that I may see a dozen cabbage moths      fluttering over the garden on a given day, and that the      females lay several hundred eggs each, these caterpillars      have never been a problem on any vegetable in my garden. Go      figure.    </p>    <p>      When I was selling vegetables it was more important that      they look good if not perfect. The holes in the leaves of      the cabbage plants and the worms in the broccoli can be      eliminated with a very benign spray called Bacillus      thuringiensis (Bt). This is a bacteria that is only harmful      to Lepidoptera-butterflies and moths. Further, it has      to be ingested by the larval caterpillar-stage of the      insect. It will not kill anything on contact. If you spray      Bt on the leaves of plants you want to protect, it will      only kill the Lepidoptera larva that eat those leaves.    </p>    <p>      While I'm on Lepidoptera, there is one more which visits my      garden that can be controlled with Bt. This is a worm about      the size of a finger: the tomato horn worm. It is so named      because of a horn on its back end. It is usually first      noticed by its excrement also. These bugs should be picked      off, as even one can eat quite a bit. The horn can be      scary, even for an old bugpicker such as myself. When you      pull the worm off, it whips around causing you to think you      might be hurt. Not so, but still you might want to wear      gloves, or use pliers or something to do them in without      grasping them with bare fingers. I'm generally too lazy to      get gloves or pliers, so I just steel myself for the task.      (The moth of the tomato horn worm can be mistaken for a      hummingbird. It is that big and it acts like a hummingbird,      too.)    </p>    <p>      I have felt the presence of three other      Lepidoptera-European corn borer, corn earworm, and      cutworm. These creatures can be killed with Bt if you can      get them to eat it. The corn borer and earworm don't hang      out on the surface of the plants. The borer bores a hole in      the stem and goes inside to eat. The earworm generally gets      inside the ear and eats the kernels. The cutworm lives      below ground. It cuts the stems of plants near the soil      line. Even if it were practical to spray the stems with Bt,      the nasty gray grub will have killed the entire plant      before the Bt takes effect.    </p>    <p>      Before I tell you what I do to avoid these problems, let me      tell you what I would do if I had them. There are a number      of good books dealing with garden insects. In them you will      find a variety of ways to control insects. What any      individual gardener uses is probably more a matter of      preference and what seems to work best for him or her.    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind that you won't always know that your method of      control is effective in a given year. It is like the common      cold. You can take aspirin, vitamin C, lots of water, and      get plenty of rest and the cold will leave in seven days,      or you can do nothing and wait it out, in which case it      will be gone in about a week. If you feel proactive      measures need to be taken, you might consider doing nothing      on part of the patch, as I did with the cabbage.    </p>    <p>      Corn borers can be hand-picked. You need to be observant.      When you detect a hole in a corn stalk and perhaps some      sawdust outside, cut a slit below the hole and dig out the      worm. European corn earworms can be controlled by squirting      mineral oil on the silk where it emerges from the ear.      Cutworms can be controlled when you are transplanting by      putting a collar around each plant. Since the grub curls      around the stem when it is cutting it, a toothpick or other      small stick pushed into the ground next to the stem may      also work.    </p>    <p>      Those are the measures I would take if I were going to do      something. If every year were like last year in the corn      patch, I might consider those actions. Last year I had corn      earworm damage in just about every ear. I don't consider      that a problem, as the part of the ear they damage can be      cut out leaving plenty to eat. But to go from virtually no      damage year after year to a year like the last one is      disconcerting. What happened?    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, a lot of things happened, which is often the      case in gardening. That's why it may take years of      observation and some experimentation to figure things out.      First, we had a winter that was unusually kind to life in      the soil. We got snow cover early and it stayed on the      ground insulating it all winter. The frost, which can go      four feet deep some winters, was only an inch deep in my      garden. Earworms and borers are usually killed in winters      north of New Jersey and fly into our fields and gardens      from the south. It is reasonable to think many survived      last winter. Second, there was a tropical storm that pumped      lots of warm air into Maine from the south at just the      right time to blow the moths of these caterpillars in our      direction. Third, I transplanted corn for the first time      ever to try to get an earlier crop. Fourth, I didn't      fertilize my corn the way I usually do.    </p>    <p>      As you might guess, I don't like the first two      possibilities. They indicate that my pest-free corn in      other years is just the luck of location. However, other      gardeners and farmers in the area in other years have had      to spray or take other measures to protect their corn,      which helps me keep faith in my methods.    </p>    <p>      When I harvested the transplanted corn and found the      earworm damage, I was convinced it was because the plants      had been weakened by transplanting. I was anxious to have      this confirmed by the later plantings of corn. You can      imagine my disappointment at finding all the plantings      damaged by caterpillars. That leads to the fourth anomaly.      I like to plant double rows of corn about six inches apart      with three-and-a-half feet between. I start by hoeing a      trench eight inches or so deep. I spread manure in the      bottom of the trench-even a hot, raw manure like      chicken. I then partially cover the manure by hoeing      another trench three inches deep on one side of the manure      trench. Seeds are planted in this trench, a pair every      foot. This is repeated on the other side of the manure      trench, the seeds covered, and, oila!, insect control in      the corn has been taken care of for another year. Last year      the manure I used was two-year-old horse manure that had      been stored outside. It was lovely humus but it didn't have      much nitrogen, which corn needs in abundance. That's what      I'm blaming my corn insect problem on. Hey, even if I had      that much of a problem every year, it would still be minor.      As proud as I am of harvesting insectfree corn year after      year, I can still live with a little damage and less pride.    </p>    <p>      There is another insect that may be found in corn. This      poor fellow suffers the slings and arrows of gardeners      though it is more beneficial than destructive. I refer to      earwigs. The earwig did not get its name from being      discovered in corn ears, though that is a frequent day-time      hangout. It was once believed that earwigs crawled into the      ears of sleeping persons. A nasty thought, especially since      they frequently do get into houses. They are not      particularly attractive, either. They are brown,      beetle-like insects, almost an inch long, with      menacing-looking pincers at the tail end that look like      forceps.    </p>    <p>      Earwigs eat a little bit of everything. Decaying matter and      other insects are helpful to us. If they eat corn silk, it      will cause the corn ears to be deformed. Did you realize      that every kernel of corn is attached to a strand of silk?      If the strand is damaged, that kernel will not develop. I      have never noticed much damage from earwigs so I leave them      alone. Anyone who wants to get rid of them can take heart      in the knowledge that they don't fly worth a darn. Most      earwig movement is as hitch-hikers. You may bring some home      from the florist or the grocery store.    </p>    <p>      Now, to wrap up the caterpillars that I have come to know      in my garden. I think I read somewhere-but since I      can't find it in any of my books right now perhaps I      dreamed it-that cutworms like wilting plants. No      matter if it isn't a proven theo ry, my experience over the      years has supported it. I can only recall one time when      cutworms bothered any vegetables other than those that had      been transplanted. We had a very dry spring that year. I      had not built up the humus level very much at the time and      plants wilted in the draught. Cutworms damaged several      crops that had been planted from seed. I had never seen      anything like it before nor have I since. The damage seemed      significant in the spring, but as the garden matured what      once seemed like big spaces filled in.    </p>    <p>      I protect my seedlings from cutworms by making their      transition from seedling flat to garden as stress-free as      possible. First, the seedlings are hardened off by moving      them outside in the flats for an hour or two the first day      and increasing the time until, in a week, they stay out      around the clock. Second, I separate the seedling roots      from each other while sloshing them around in a bucket of      water and working the planting medium back and fourth      gently. This minimizes the amount of root damage. I put a      tablespoon or so of liquid seaweed in the bucket of water      just for good measure. When the transplants go in the      ground the soil is firmed around the roots and then the      ground is soaked so that the water will further put roots      in contact with soil. lust in case, I hold onto extra      plants either healed in at the end of the row or still in      flats as replacements. I seldom need a replacement.    </p>    <p>      I set out in this article to cover all the insects that      damage crops in my vegetable garden. They are such a small      part of gardening that I was sure I could cover the subject      adequately, but I have only covered caterpillars, earwigs,      and aphids. It was not my intention to slight the beetle      family known to my cucumbers, asparagus, beans, and, of      course, potatoes. Lets not forget the flea beetles that      have wiped out early plantings of broccoli and severely      stunted radishes. Then there are flies that lay eggs that      become root maggots and leaf miners. Squash bugs are always      good for a laugh, especially when you squash them and are      reminded that when you were younger you called them stink      bugs. All told there are 17 vegetable-eating insects with      which I have become familiar over the years, and so far I      only covered eight. Next issue I'll finish the job.    </p>    <p>      Part II of our guide to "Low-Maintenance Pest Control" will      appear in April.    </p>    <p>      Related Articles:    </p>    <p>      Types of Pest Control    </p>
