                <p>      <strong>Herbal Remedies</strong>		</p>				<p>      Remedies to keep you breathing easy.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Charles Dickson, Ph.D.    </h5>        <p>      History has given the nose a bum rap. It seems to be the      most unflattering part of the human anatomy. Romantic      writers talk about straight noses, slender noses, snug      noses, and jolly red noses. Shakespeare described one of      his characters as having a nose as sharp as a pen, and in      the Bible's book of Song of Solomon the writer tells his      beloved that her nose is like the tower of Lebanon. (Don't      try that one on yours.) While it can't be proven, the      English writer Edward Lear may have started the idea of      "nosy" people when one of his characters is reminded to      "mind his nose."    </p>    <p>      Whatever art, literature, and history have done to the      image of the nose, it remains a vital part of the anatomy.      It is the organ of breathing and smelling and one to which      we pay little attention until problems occur. We can't      smell when we have a cold because the infection associated      with the cold inflames the mucous membranes of the nasal      passages and thereby blocks the movement of air to the      center of smell. In the highest part of the nasal cavity      are olfactory nerves which pick up smell and send its      sensations to the olfactory lobe of the brain which records      the smell. In this way we can distinguish a rose from a      skunk, or a freshly brewed cup of coffee from freshly      thrown fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      In addition to holding our sun glasses in the vicinity of      our eyes, our nose enables us to inhale air from the      outside and process it along to our lungs. One of the early      signs of cold or flu is the stuffy nose or the runny one      which is sometimes accompanied by cold sores on the      external area of the nose. There are many excellent      remedies you can make to deal with these discomforts. For      colds and nasal discomfort in general, try these:    </p>    <p>      Combine half a clove of garlic with a teaspoon of cayenne      (hot) pepper, the juice of one lemon, and a teaspoon of      honey. Take this mixture three times daily. It's not      guaranteed to make you smell like Chanel No. 5, but it will      clear up the symptoms in a couple of days. You can also      prepare a tea by placing one teaspoon each of cinnamon,      sage, and bay leaves in hot water. Add a few squirts of      concentrated lemon juice and drink. Another good remedy is      made by boiling the leaves and flowers of borage (from your      backyard garden or the local health food store) in a pan of      water. Allow this to steep for 10 minutes, then strain and      drink a cup of the extract three times each day.    </p>    <p>      An additional effective remedy for colds in general can be      made by mixing one tablespoon each of yarrow, catnip,      thyme, mint, sage, and verbena. After mixing well, place a      teaspoon of the mix in a cup of boiling water for 10      minutes. Strain through cheesecloth and sweeten with a      little honey.    </p>    <p>      Drink three or four cups each day. It produces a result not      unlike the effect of being pulled over by the local traffic      cop-it really makes you sweat. The profuse sweating      caused by this remedy is what serves to drive out the cold      symptoms.    </p>    <p>      What about the stuffy nose that forces you to breathe      through your mouth and talk funny? Try these remedies:      Inhale the vapors of one grated horseradish. Or crush a      clove of garlic in a cup of warm water and place a few      drops of the garlic solution into each nasal passage. And      don't forget the old standby of hot chicken soup to which      you may add garlic, parsley, and onion. Several good      inhalants can be made right in your kitchen. One consists      of a quarter cup of lemon thyme in a quart of water. Boil      and inhale the steam. You can also make an effective vapor      by adding one ounce of chopped comfrey leaves or root to      one cup of water. Boil this mixture and inhale the steam.      To get the best results, cover your head and the basin with      a towel. And you can also get good results by adding a half      cup of vinegar to boiling water and inhaling the fumes. Of      course, all these methods sound pretty logical, so here is      one that sounds crazy and illogical, but it works. Place      several cubes of ice in a basin of water and place only      your toes in the water until they begin to feel numb. You      won't end up with frostbite, but it will serve to clear the      nasal passages.    </p>    <p>      Millions of people suffer from irritated sinuses due to      allergy attacks, air pollution, smoke, or viral infection.      This is called sinusitis. Don't give in to it. Fight back      with home remedies. Mix together two cups of cold water      with one tablespoon of Epsom salts and two teaspoons of      bicarbonate of soda. Dip a clean cloth in the liquid and      place over the sinus area. Another method involves      dissolving a 500 mg vitamin C tablet in a quarter cup of      warm water. Apply directly to the nostrils with an      eyedropper. Still another eyedropper remedy can be made by      putting a teaspoon of dried rose petals in a cup of boiling      water. Steep until cool, strain, and dip a cotton ball in      the liquid. Apply this as a compress and place drops in the      nostrils. One other method for sinusitis has been found to      be helpful by many sufferers. Eat two garlic cloves three      times a day for a week. Sinuses should start draining after      a few days. Admittedly this is a tough treatment to stay      with, in that you must be careful not to get close to      anyone during the week, and romantic moments are definitely      a no-no.    </p>    <p>      If our noses give us trouble with frequent running or      stuffing up, those instances will in all likelihood be      accompanied by the occasional bloody nose. The nose is the      most vascular area of the body, which means that nasal      passages are packed with veins and capillaries, many lying      just below the thin lining of the nostrils, practically      waiting for the right conditions to start bleeding. Very      dry air, some dust or dirt, or a dozen other irritants may      get the blood flow started. There are some simple remedies,      however, for dealing with the problem. If your nosebleed is      persistent, ice may stop the flow quickly. There are      several methods you can try here. Studies have shown that      sucking ice cubes can constrict the blood vessels, and this      often helps. Some doctors recommend a cold compress of ice      wrapped in a washcloth and placed on the forehead and      bridge of the nose. Some even suggest a bag of frozen peas      smashed up like a bean bag and wrapped in a towel. Vitamin      C tablets and zinc tablets have both been shown to be      important in the maintenance of body tissues, including the      blood vessels. Taking a tablet of each every day as well as      eating foods rich in vitamin C, including fruits and      vegetables, is recommended. You will want to avoid taking      aspirin unless your doctor has prescribed it for another      condition, since aspirin is an anticoagulant or "blood      thinner" which can aggravate a sensitive nose and cause it      to bleed.    </p>    <p>      Whatever the poets and romanticists opine about our noses,      we all have to live with them right in the middle of our      faces. Hopefully some knowledge of these "nosy" remedies      will make our life with them a more compatible arrangement.    </p>
