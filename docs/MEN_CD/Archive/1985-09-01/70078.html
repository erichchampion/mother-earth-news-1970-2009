                <p>      <em>As autumn descends on us, the slow baring of the trees      opens a window to the activities of some of the most common      and fascinating wild mammals of North America.</em>    </p>        <p>      Among both hunters and amateur naturalists, the squirrels      (family Sciuridae) make up one of the most popular groups      of wild creatures on this continent. These little animals      are highly adaptable, and most species have proven able to      survive, and even thrive, in areas where human destruction      of habitat has long since eliminated less opportunistic      mammals. They can be seen dancing limb to limb in city      parks and on wilderness hillsides from coast to coast,      and-being a very diverse bunchinclude not only the      <em>tree</em> squirrels, but also such seemingly dissimilar      animals as chipmunks, woodchucks, flying squirrels, prairie      dogs, marmots, and ground squirrels.    </p>                            <p>      Still, to most of us, squirrel means one of the      bushy-tailed tree dwellers. (In fact, the family name      translates as "shade tail," a reference to the arboreal      species' habit of curling their tails over their backs.)      These are the squirrels most commonly admired by students      of nature and most often transformed into tasty meals by      hunters.    </p>    <p>      Whether your chosen activity is observation or pursuit,      your success and satisfaction will be increased if you take      the time to learn about your quarry. So, to add to the fun      you'll find in squirrel watching or hunting, we've prepared      the following guide to the more common tree squirrels of      North America.    </p>
