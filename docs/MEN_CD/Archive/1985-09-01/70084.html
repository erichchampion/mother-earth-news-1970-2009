                <p>      All right, so don't have a $5,000 solar greenhouse. That      doesn't mean you can't grow your very own fresh winter      greens.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Susan Glaese, Bob Kornegay, and MOTHER's staff    </h5>            <p>      Fall. A few lights frosts, some frantic scrambling to pick      everything salvageable from the garden, and then-      <em>wham</em> ! A hard freeze hits. All your plants die.      Time to call it quits... another gardening year is      finished.    </p>    <p>      Ahhh, but wouldn't it be nice if you <em>could</em> keep      your crops growing? If you could step outdoors in the      winter and harvest a few vegetables to sustain you through      those long months of preserved and purchased produce?    </p>    <p>      Well, the good news is that you <em>can</em> do just that.      The better news is that doing so won't cost you an arm and      a leg; we're not talking here about building a full-sized      solar greenhouse. And the best news is that-if you      hop to it-you can do it this very fall, in time to      have your own cold-weather harvest.    </p>    <p>      This article will tell you how to build MOTHER's gardeners'      two favorite low-cost, season-extending devices . . . how      to use and maintain them . . . and what crops to raise in      them.    </p>    <h3>      THE TUNNEL CLOCHE    </h3>    <p>      Collect some 2' pieces of rebar, 5' to 10' lengths of 1/2"      PVC pipe, one sheet of 6- to 8-mil clear plastic, and two      pieces of rope, and you've got all the ingredients for a      tunnel cloche. It's easy to build, portable-you can      even construct it right over a bed of already established      fall greens-and quite inexpensive (it'll cover 48      square feet for around $15).    </p>    <p>      And this simple crop saver really works! Last fall Bob      Kornegay tunnel-cloched a 20-square-foot bed of spinach      behind the low-cost permaculture homestead at MOTHER's      Eco-Village. The greens-which had been sown outdoors      in September-made it fine through the winter in our      4,200-degreeday climate . . . including the record-breaking      night when the mercury hit 16°F below zero! During      those cold months, they grew sparsely: just enough so Bob      could harvest fresh leaves for salads about every other      day. By the end of February, though, he was giving salad      leaves away. And come March, he had all that he could cook      up, eat raw, <em>and</em> freeze!    </p>    <p>      Fig. 1 shows the parts of a PVC tunnel cloche. To put one      together, all you have to do is drive two-foot lengths of      rebar (iron reinforcing rod) into the ground every three or      four feet on either side of the growing bed. Bend a PVC      hoop over each set of rebar pieces. (The exact length of      the PVC will depend on the width of your bed: five feet of      pipe for a two-foot-wide bed, eight feet for a three-foot      bed, nine for four, and ten for five.) Drape your plastic      on top and then secure it at the base to keep that cold      night air out. You can do this by simply weighting down the      sides and ends with rocks, or by bunching the ends together      with ropes and snugly securing those lines. Bob has found      that the only time he really needs to tie his cloches' ends      is during March, when our area receives strong spring      winds. Then he uses an adjustable slipknot-shown in      Fig. 2-to keep those cords tight.    </p>    <p>      There are other simple ways to make tunnel cloches. You can      make your hoops of spring steel poked into the ground. Lay      your plastic over those, then run a second hoop or string      right next to each of the supporting ones to hold the      plastic in place (see Fig. 3). Or you can use reinforcing      wire mesh arched over the bed (cut the material so both      sides have lots of wire ends to poke into the ground) and      cover that with plastic (Fig. 4).    </p>        <h3>      THE COLD FRAME    </h3>        <p>      Tunnel cloches are definitely the "hot" plant protector at      the Eco-Village these days-we're using them more and      more. But we're far from abandoning our other small-scale      season extender: the cold frame.    </p>    <p>      A cold frame, essentially, is a bottomless box (usually of      wood) that faces south, is higher in the back (the north      side), and is covered with glass or plastic. Cold frames      are durable, attractive, easy to use, and-because of      their increased insulation-probably better at      protecting plants from extreme cold than the all-plastic      cloches. On the other hand, they do cost more to construct      than tunnel cloches: The materials for the 4' X 6' model      shown in Fig. 5 cost around $150, <em>not</em> counting the      glazing. And although you build such a miniature greenhouse      from the bottom up, you should design it from the top down      . . . in other words, it's easier to get your glass (or      other glazing) first and build the frame to fit it. If you      can scrounge up some usable windows or glass door panels,      you'll have trimmed a considerable expense.    </p>    <p>      You'll want to build your cold frame so the top slants      southward, but don't worry about trying to get the "best"      sun-catching angle; that's usually not critical. Do be sure      to paint the interior white to help diffuse the admitted      light, though.    </p>    <p>      Unless you'd prefer to have a portable cold frame, you'll      want to lay some type of foundation. You can use concrete      block, rot-resistant wood (such as locust, cedar, or      cypress), or lumber painted with a latex acrylic paint or a      homemade preservative of copper naphthenate or linseed oil.      (Never use creosote or pentachlorophenol on a cold frame.)      Lay this below frost level and insulate it with closed-cell      foam board insulation. You might also be wise to place      gravel under and around your frame's foundation to improve      its drainage and to help protect the wood.    </p>    <p>      For glazing, use glass if you scrounged up windows . . .      6-mil polyethylene if you want to skimp (and have a very      temporary covering) . . . or a fancy fiberglass-reinforced      plastic (FRP) if you want something durable (and pricey).      Since your biggest heat loss will be through the top of the      cold frame, you'd do well to double-glaze the top. One of      the most practical and cost-effective ways to do that is to      use glass on the top and plastic underneath. The glass will      help filter ultraviolet rays, which deteriorate plastic.      And if the glass should ever break, the plastic may help      catch the pieces!    </p>    <p>      You'll need to devise some way to open the windows. You can      either hinge them in the back or-as we      did-build channels for the units so you can slide      them up and down (which gives finer ventilation control).      In addition, you may want to lay down pliable weather      stripping where the glazing meets the sides of your frame      to help seal that junction.    </p>    <p>      Up to a certain point, plants <em>double their growth      rate</em> for every 10°F rise in soil temperature, so      anything you do to help keep the ground warm is going to      pay off. For starters, insulate the sides of the frame with      some closed-cell foam board . . . or simply pile hay or      even soil around it.    </p>    <p>      You can further improve the frame's thermal performance by      adding some heat-retaining mass to it. If you insulated the      foundation, you're effectively using the interior soil      itself as thermal mass. You can also stack 30-gallon      water-filled drums, painted black, along the back wall,      either on the ground or partly buried in the soil.    </p>    <p>      And if you really want to help heat the frame bed, bury a      mixture of fresh manure and straw or wood shavings under      the bed's soil . . . and create what's called a hotbed. The      decomposing pile will generate heat for your plant's soil.      Don't use manure alone for this purpose: It'll cook too hot      and too quickly, possibly harming your plants with excess      ammonia gas.    </p>        <h3>      HOW TO USE A CLOCHE OR FRAME    </h3>    <p>      If you're new to this art of gently coaxing plants to grow      out-of-season, you need to know that such "solar-intensive"      gardening is demanding. So start small-just try out      one tunnel cloche or cold frame this season-and      construct your plant shelter as near to your house as      possible.    </p>    <p>      Since you will be working with a limited amount of      sheltered space, do everything you can to utilize it      efficiently. Plant in wide beds, not in single rows, and      eat all you harvest (including broccoli leaves, carrot      tops-in salads-and cut-up greens stems). Just      as important, create the best possible soil for your crops.      Compost and fertilizing amendments are vital, since most of      the commonly grown winter vegetables are heavy feeders and      will be growing under somewhat stressful conditions.    </p>    <p>      Maintaining proper moisture levels is another way of      promoting maximum growth and reducing plant stress. You'll      probably need to water deeply only once a week in the fall      and spring . . . and even less during the coldest months of      winter. You certainly don't want to overwater, since that      can lead to damping-off and other diseases.    </p>    <p>      Just as critical as the amount of liquid you provide is      <em>when</em> you supply it and <em>what temperature</em>      it is. Never water a cold frame or cloche in the evening;      that would only make the plants colder during the coming      night. If you have no means of heating your liquid, the      best time to water is in the morning-then the heat of      the day can help warm the water, air, and soil together.      (The water will also provide some additional thermal mass      to store that day's heat.) Far better is heating the liquid      before you give it to the plants. Hot tap water will do      fine. Or simply leave plastic gallon jugs, painted black,      in your plant shelter. On a good sunny day, those jugs may      reach 80 to 85°F by late morning. The water will then      be ready to use . . . probably just at the time your frame      needs to be opened up for venting, anyway!    </p>    <h3>      THE BIG HITCH    </h3>    <p>      That beings us to the worst inconvenience of such      solar-intensive gardening: venting. We know, we      know-you went to all this work to create a plant      environment that captures and retains as much heat as      possible. Ironically, though, you've got to let some of      that warmth out on many sunny days. Otherwise, your plants      may get too hot, the gases they outbreathe may reach      harmful levels, and the interior humidity may get high      enough to create blissful conditions for molds, mildews,      and fungi.    </p>    <p>      So whenever the temperature inside your frame or cloche      begins to soar, you've got to crack it open a bit (don't      just fling it open, as the sudden cold may shock your      plants). Some days you may find yourself making see eral      trips to ventilate and close systems-a prime reason      for locating the winter garden as close to your house as      possible.    </p>    <p>      As Susan puts it, managing winter frames and cloches      requires "being married to the garden." Just keep reminding      yourself of the extra-fresh food you get to eat at a time      of year when store-bought produce is low-quality, shipped      long distances, and heavily sprayed.    </p>    <h3>      GOOD CROPS    </h3>    <p>      Plants that have long maturity dates or require pollination      to set fruit are poor choices for frame and cloche      gardening. Cabbages, broccoli, and cauliflower handle cold      weather better but take up a lot of space for what they      yield. Root crops such as carrots and parsnips can be good      choices. In most climates, however, you can plant these in      summer-we start our winter carrots in      mid-July-cover then, in late fall with several inches      of straw, and pull back that covering whenever you want to      harvest some. (They'll be easier to find under that mulch      if you plant them in little "channels" spaced 5" or 6"      apart across the bed.) "Storing" root crops under mulch      leaves your frames and cloches free for other crops.    </p>    <p>      So what <em>are</em> the best choices for sheltered      growing? The most obvious selections are the "pick and come      again" leaf crops such as mustard, Swiss chard, ruby chard,      parsley, kale, collards, spinach, and hardy leaf lettuces.      But greens aren't the only good choices: New research has      shown that many <em>oriental vegetables</em> are      wonderfully adapted to frame and cloche growing conditions.      Bok (or pak) choi, daikon radish, michili, gai lohn,      shingiku, and wong bok cabbage are just a few of these      plants. If you're not already familiar with using these in      stir-fried dishes, salads, soups, casseroles, quiches, and      more, now may be just the time to experiment. (See the      sidebar for some suggested cold-season varieties and      sources.)    </p>		    <h3>      GROW TO IT!    </h3>    <p>      Both cloches and cold frames are useful for all seasons of      the gardening year. Hardy vegetables planted in the      shelters in mid fall may yield abundant, super-early spring      produce. Later in the spring, the plant houses can be used      to harden of vegetable seedlings and start cuttings of      herbs or ornamentals. If you replace the panes or plastic      with a gardener's shade cloth, you've got a place to raise      summer lettuce. And you can set a cloche or portable cold      frame in the garden itself to overwinter half-hardy      perennials . . . to dry and warm a section of the garden      you want to plant in early spring . . . or to shield some      tender transplants you want to gently heel in. (In this      last case, try draping a white bed sheet over the frame or      cloche for a day or two to moderate both light and heat.)    </p>    <p>      So why wait? Start this fall with one tunnel cloche or cold      frame, and try your own seasonextending garden experiments.      If all goes well, while your friends are picking their way      through seed catalogs and dreaming of spring, you'll be      picking your way through the crops of your own wintertime      harvest!    </p>
