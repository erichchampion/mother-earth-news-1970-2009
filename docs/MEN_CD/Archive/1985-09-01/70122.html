                    <h5 id="byline">      by Mike Benton    </h5>        <p>      Most every summer, when canning season rolled around, my      grandfather could be heard to comment, "Pickles ain't my      favorite food, but what <em>else</em> can you do with      cucumbers?"    </p>    <p>      Those words of his came vividly to mind last summer when,      as a result of overenthusiastic planting, my wife and I      were faced, not with an abundance of cukes, but with a      hundred heads of cabbage!    </p>    <p>      "Coleslaw?" I mused, as we contemplated the small mountain      of red and green leafy heads.    </p>    <p>      "No, sauerkraut!" she replied.    </p>    <p>      Well, I thought we'd bettered Granddad's solution to the      cucumber problem nicely. Though <em>coleslaw</em> certainly      "ain't my favorite food," kraut is, to my mind, a      preeminent edible. Furthermore, it's not only tasty but      also very nutritious. In fact, sauerkraut actually contains      <em>more</em> vitamin C than the cabbage it's made from.    </p>    <p>      Many folks claim kraut serves as a blood cleanser and a      bowel regulator. In addition, it's a <em>predigested</em>      food: The starches in the cabbage are converted, during the      krautmaking process, into simple sugars that are easily      assimilated by the body. The bacteria (lactobacillus) that      are responsible for the transformation will, like those in      yogurt or other cultured foods, take up residence in your      intestinal tract and help your body manufacture its own B      vitamins.    </p>    <p>      Yep, nutritionally speaking, sauerkraut has a lot going for      it . . . and only one real drawback-salt.    </p>    <p>      More and more health-conscious people are reducing the      amount of salt in their diets, and I was hesitant to      prepare a big batch of normal, salty sauerkraut, since I      knew excess sodium can aggravate such conditions as high      blood pressure and kidney problems.    </p>    <p>      "So, let's make <em>saltless</em> kraut," said my wife.    </p>    <p>      Saltless sauerkraut? Well, we certainly had enough cabbage      to experiment with, so we took a stab at it. And we were      pleasantly surprised; we made delicious, salt-free      sauerkraut . . . and it was so good that I'd like to share      the recipe with you here.    </p>    <h3>      INGREDIENTS AND UTENSILS    </h3>    <p>      You'll need the following:    </p>    <p>      1 bushel of red, green, or mixed cabbages (this will make a      <em>big</em> batch of kraut . . . you might want to try      making a few two- or three-head batches, perhaps with      different herb and spice mixtures, before you go whole hog)    </p>    <p>      any spices, herbs, or vegetables you wish to add (peppers,      cukes, beets, carrots, and cauliflower are popular choices)    </p>    <p>      1 five-gallon earthenware crock    </p>    <p>      a plate or heavy pot lid that fits inside the crock    </p>    <p>      a baseball bat    </p>    <h3>      AND AWAY WE GO    </h3>    <p><strong>      Step One:    </strong></p>    <p>      Thoroughly clean the crock, plate, and bat, as well as the      cabbage and other vegetables. Set aside some of the large      outer cabbage leaves. (In the directions that follow, treat      any additional vegetables in the same manner as the      cabbage.)    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Two:    </strong></p>    <p>      Cut or shred the cabbage into fine strips.    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Three:    </strong></p>    <p>      Put about a two-inch layer of shredded cabbage in the      crock, and pound and press it with the bat until the      cabbage is covered by its own juice.    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Four:    </strong></p>    <p>      Sprinkle your chosen herbs and spices over the cabbage,      using a half teaspoon for each head. Dill, caraway seed,      and thyme work well, and kelp or dulse, available in most      natural foods stores, can be added to impart a salty taste.    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Five:    </strong></p>    <p>      Add a second layer of cabbage and pound as before, then add      seasonings again. Continue the process until the crock is      about threequarters full or until you run out of cabbage.    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Six:    </strong></p>    <p>      Place a few of the whole outer cabbage leaves on top and      cover them with the plate or lid, which should be weighted      down with a well-washed rock.    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Seven:    </strong></p>    <p>      Cover the crock with a clean cloth and place it in a cool      place (60°-70°F). After a few days, a froth will      appear on top of the liquid. Skim this off, remove the      weight and lid, and wash them in hot water before replacing      them. Repeat this step every few days.    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Eight:    </strong></p>    <p>      Depending upon your taste preference, it will take one to      three weeks for the kraut to be ready. (Just try a sample      each time you clean the lid and rock.) At that time, store      the sauerkraut in sterile glass jars.    </p>    <p><strong>      Step Nine:    </strong></p>    <p>      <em>Refrigerate the kraut.</em> Without salt, fermentation      will continue, so the sauerkraut will spoil if it's not      refrigerated. It will, however, stay delicious under      refrigeration for about three weeks.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: When testing Mike's recipe, we found that      there's less risk of spoilage if the kraut is allowed to      "work" in an area that maintains a temperature of no more      than 65°F.    </p>
