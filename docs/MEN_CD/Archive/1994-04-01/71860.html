                <p>      <strong>Country Skills</strong>    </p>    	  <p>      Well-preserved older cars and trucks everyone can afford to      buy and fix.		</p>	<h5 id="byline">		      By John Vivian.    </h5>        <p>      My truck was in the shop and they'd loaned me a little      '90s-era "world" car. I don't recall whether it was a      Nissan, Ford, or whatever. With their squinty headlights      and wedgie shapes, the new cars all look alike to me. Their      computer-managed engines run alike as well: competent,      fuel-stingy... and dull. But this one handled crisply, the      stereo was "awesome" as the kids say, and I was getting      used to the "ergonomic" cockpit.    </p>    <p>      Then, halfway up a lonely hill road, the idiot lights went      on, the engine died, and a whole chorus of beepers and      buzzers piped up. I got out to look under the hood,      expecting to wire a broken choke pull-off or attach a loose      hose and be on my way. But nothing in the engine      compartment was familiar to my '50s-trained auto-eye. There      wasn't even a carburetor, but a squat gray box labeled      "Electronic Fuel Injection" surrounded by a snarl of tubes,      pipes, wires, and hoses.    </p>    <p>      After hiking to a phone, I found myself bouncing down the      mountain in the cab of Ben Perkins' old Dodge tow truck.      After driving the claustrophobic little car-now      trailing along behind-I relished spreading out on the      roomy bench seat, able to spread my elbows and cross my      legs. The truck was as friendly as an old dog. Its engine      growled, the muffler rumbled, gears whined, and I      luxuriated in the faint odors of gasoline, engine oil, and      gear grease. The truck may have been homely and a little      rough in places, but it was sturdy, practical, and      straightforward. An honest-Abe Lincoln of a truck.    </p>    <p>      "Sure runs good, Ben," I said. "How long you had it?"    </p>    <p>      "Got it war-surplus in '62," he said. "Fer $275."    </p>    <p>      "Not too shabby a deal," I said. "How many miles?"    </p>    <p>      "Dunno fer sure," he said. "It came with 1,500, but the      odometer quit in '75. Quarter million, I'd guess."    </p>    <p>      Ben said that he'd replaced the bed and cab floors and the      fenders when they threatened to rust out, had put in      "several" clutches, and rebuilt the transmission twice.      When leaded gas was phased out, he replaced the original      "flathead-6" engine with a "Chevy V-8 that's about ready      fer a rebuild." He hadn't done a whole lot more to the      truck in 30 years' time but change the oil and keep tires      on it.    </p>    <p>      "How's the towing business?" I asked.    </p>    <p>      "Never better," Ben said. "Can't nobody work on these new      'government cars' but the city dealers that sold 'em. Nope,      business ain't bad at all."    </p>    	    <h3>      Why Buy New?    </h3>    <p>      After the home, most country residents' single greatest      expense is buying and maintaining the vehicles they depend      on. In a "buy-now/pay-later," throwaway economy, we're      huckstered to borrow $10,000-30,000 for a new or      late-model-used car or truck. Over a five-year loan,      principal and interest, insurance, taxes, fees, and upkeep      combine to cost one and a half to twice the vehicle's      price. We end up paying as much as $40,000 for a $20,000      vehicle.    </p>    <p>      Why? A new car depreciates 20% as soon as it leaves the lot      and it falls another 10% or 15% each year thereafter. After      five years and 80,000 miles, the value of a $20,000 vehicle      (that we paid double for) is only $4,500. But it's a tough      habit to break; the new cars have all those new features,      snazzy styling, and the neighbors just got a new sports      utility with fourwheel drive and that "new car smell." But      the neighbors are also never free of car payments.    </p>    <p>      In contrast, Ben Perkins makes a good living and (with a      slide-in camper in place of the wrecker) goes to Florida      every February in a truck that has cost him less to buy      used and to maintain himself over 30 years than what most      consumers shell out in any one year to buy new.    </p>    <p>      You or I can still get the truck that Ben drives: a      low-mile, rust-free, four-wheel-drive '50s militaryspec      pickup just out of government storage and running      fine-but these days, it'll cost $2,500 to $4,500.    </p>    	    <p>      For the same or less money (a lot less if you shop hard,      dicker harder, pay upfront and in cash) you can buy a      younger, more conventional car or truck that will be more      reliable, better looking, cheaper to operate, sturdier, and      safer to drive than any modern vehicle. Plus you or any      corner gas station mechanic can fix most problems using      reasonably priced parts stocked by any NAPA or Western      Autowho will also sell you "new car smell" in an aerosol      can.<br />      <br />      Indeed, if you pick the model and year carefully, your      vehicle can be worth more at the end of five years than      when you bought it. Many '50s to '70s cars and trucks are      (or soon will be) appreciating in value. Get ahold of the      Old Cars Price Guide and JC Whitney parts catalog-on      newsstands or by mail (see "Sources") and go old-car      shopping.		</p>		<h3>	      State of the Art    </h3>    <p>      American vehicles of the late '60s/early '70s are examples      of a technology at its peak-design and engineering      refined over a half century was as simple, sturdy, and      foolproof as it ever got. Weighing two tons, made of      sheet-steel panels on steelI-beam frames, with cast-iron      engines and forged steel axles, they are 70% to 90%      sturdier and safer than a modern car. A case in point: In      city traffic, a Suzuki Samurai darted out in front of the      1973 Mercury Marquis station wagon that a neighbor bought      for $300. Thankfully, nobody was hurt and insurance paid      for damage to the vehicles. The 20-year-old Merc's left      front bumper and fender were pushed in, but not enough to      bother fixing. Impacted at the side, the $12,000 Japanese      model folded like a book and was declared a total loss.    </p>    <p>      Old cars also win in performance, beauty...and class. A      good friend who commutes from a city job to his country      home got fed up with monthly payments, so he sold his Mazda      RX7 and bought a 1970 Cadillac DeVille convertible. It is      over 17 feet long, has gleaming white paint, a white top      and white glove leather interior, and is "loaded" with      power everything. Like all GM "Big Block" V8s, it averages      11 miles per gallon (mpg) whether going uphill pulling a      trailer or downhill with a tailwind. And despite spending      more (but not much) for fuel, his maintenance bill fell by      half and his insurance bill and auto-excise taxes by 900      (he doesn't bother insuring the car against damage, fire,      or theft). It only has 75,000 miles on it and cost $4,500,      cash.    </p>    <p>      The Caddy fairly shouts "Made in America." And it makes      people happy. Strangers wave. Pedestrians come over and pat      the hood. When it rumbles into a gas station, attendants      vie to check the oil of an engine built back when      displacement was measured not in wimpy "ccs," but in cubic      inches-460 of them cranking out 420 horsepower. Unless held      back, it winds up to 85 or 90 on the doublenickel      interstate, but traffic cops just grin like fools and      salute as it steams by.    </p>    	    <h3>      What To Look (And Not Look) For    </h3>    <p>      Regal as it is, a '70 Cadillac isn't old, rare, or elegant      enough to be a "collectible car," like a perfectly      preserved, show-quality Stutz Bearcat, Deusenberg, or even      a "T"-model Ford. Indeed, for daily driving, you should      beware of any really scarce or off-beat cars-called      "Specialty Interest Cars" in the auto press. An article I      read recently suggested saving money by buying a Ford      Fiesta, a blocky little Honda-fighter made by Kia of Korea      and imported by Ford from '78 till the Escort appeared in      '81. A generic econobox when new, it sells for      $100-junk value-now, even if running well. It's      an "orphan," a car whose maker is out of business or didn't      sell enough cars to manufacture a good supply of repair      parts. Mechanics and NAPA have forgotten it ever existed      and you'd have to scrounge junkyards and bruise your own      knuckles to keep it going.    </p>    <p>      Avoid orphans. Get a car that was popular in its day, free      of serious problems and reasonably priced for its type so      that it sold in substantial numbers. But pick your model      year carefully.<br />      <br />      <strong>MADE IN AMERICA</strong><br />      By swapping his new Mazda RX7 for a '70 Caddy, my friend      cut his maintenance bills in half.    </p>    <h3>      Neither Too Young...    </h3>    <p>      If you can, avoid cars made after '73 or trucks after `79,      the years in which government fuel-efficiency and      air-pollution limits took effect. In '74, Lee Iacocca's      great Ford Mustang became a "government car," the Mustang      2-fat, slow, and worth at most $5,000 today to a car      collector ...while a '73 can bring $16,000.    </p>    <p>      To save weight, cars were "downsized" and steel-beam frames      were replaced by unibody construction, where the framework      is of the same sheet metal as the shell, a bit rolled or      folded at the edgeskind of like corrugating paper for      strength. As cars and power plants got smaller, performance      was retained to a degree with fuel-injected,      multiple-valve, turbocharged engines that are so      complicated that, once the warranty expires, major service      can cost more than the vehicle is worth.    </p>    <p>      Still more weight was saved with frontwheel drive,      McPherson struts, and rack-and-pinion steering. But many      such modern components are non-repairable. Replacements      cost hundreds of dollars and installing them requires a      $60/hr mechanic with small hands and a big shop.      Old-fashioned counterparts-universal joints, tie-rod      ends, coil springs, and shock absorbers-cost just a      few dollars apiece and you can install them yourself with a      medium-size adjustable wrench and big screwdriver.    </p>    <p>      Many '80s engine-management systems were cobbled-up by      tacking a snarl of rubber tubing and plastic valves on a      preemissions engine design. For a delivery route I used to      drive, I bought an `81 Renault LeCar, the dumbly named      U.S.emissions version of the R-5, a little French racer.      The poor thing was so strangled with a smog pump,      acceleration-rate limiter, antibackfire spring,      deceleration damper, and such that it couldn't get up hills      in second gear. I ripped out all the tubing but a single      vacuum hose between manifold and distributor and it took      off like a scared hare. (I must caution that tampering with      emissions equipment or letting it wear or break is against      state and federal law and liable get your car kicked off      the road, especially if you live in California or another      state with smog problems in its big cities.)    </p>    	    <h3>      ...Nor Too Old    </h3>    <p>      With a few exceptions, the upper age limit for an everyday      driver is mid '60s. Prewar antiques and the '50s      chrome-and-fin extravaganzas of GM design chief Harley      Earle are collector cars or junk awaiting restoration.      Plus, fuel economy was not an engineering priority when you      could fill your tank for a dollar and change. A 40-year-old      straight-6, L-head engine will do well to get 10 mpg on      today's low octane gas ...and you'd have to install      hardened exhaust valves and seats or they'll burn out      without tetraethyl lead in the fuel. (Lead substitutes are      expensive and not that effective.) Plus, well-kept sporty      models of '50s/early '60s cars are becoming so valuable you      wouldn't want to drive one in everyday traffic.    </p>    <p>      Look for a modern but preemissions, preelectronics-era      vehicle. That would be a car from the '64 through '73 model      years. Or seek out a truck built before smog controls      affected them in '79, but after the major body-style      changes made by the Big 3 in '67. The later body styles (GM      '73 to '78) are a little more tinny than the previous      series (GM '67 to '72) but are younger and cheaper to      repair. Cars from '73 to '81 are better than any brand-new      models, but they do have smog controls (Cadillac pioneered      them). Don't go younger than '81 with car or truck; not      even expert hot-rod carburetor-maker Holley can design a      bolt-on performance carb that's 50-state street-legal      beyond then. Old-style carbs hooked up to the gas tank and      maybe the battery for an electric choke and to vacuum for      secondary throttle. By '81, they also had to accommodate      the exhaust-gas recirculation system, the positive      crankcase ventilation system, vacuum canisters, distributor      spark advance, and fuel bowl vents. After '81, carbs and      all else automotive went Star Wars and nobody can figure      them out.		</p>		<h3>	      Locating A Good Used Vehicle    </h3>    <p>      Time your search. Convertibles are expensive in early      spring when the sap's rising in all life forms; 4WD truck      prices cycle in reverse. In November, many $2,000 trucks      are fitted with $800 snow plows and offered for $4,999.    </p>    <p>      Look for your dream car or truck in the classifieds, in      newsstand "auto market" magazines, on bulletin boards, and      in back of barns, garages, and repair shops. Avoid new      dealerships that charge top dollar for late-model "cream      puffs." They wholesale older cars to auction ...which is      where used-car dealers get most of their stock. Either type      lot has to make money and you are better off with a private      purchase. Hundreds of thousands of well-loved and      well-maintained old cars languish in garages across the      nation. Owners are loath to trade them for a new car, as      the trade-in value is zilch. But when the garage gets too      full, the cars go on the market somewhere between wholesale      and top collector special interest car price.    </p>    <p>      Condition of collector cars is rated between #1 (show      quality/never driven) through #3 and #4 (best for daily      use) to #6, a literal basket case. For example, the Buick      GS 455 Stage 1 is a Muscle Car with awesome power. But it      got little pub licity. Today's prices for a '70 convertible      are: #6: $760; #5: $2,300; #4: $3,800; #3: $7,600; #2:      $14,000; #1: $20,000.    </p>    <p>      Prices for a better-known car, say a '70 Mustang Boss 429      ragtop, range from $2,000 for #6/boxes of parts, to almost      $60,000 for a #1 show car-although the Buick GS is      bigger and better built and can dust it in the high gears.    </p>    <p>      A just slightly less muscular but much less popular '70      Dodge Dart Swinger 340 hardtop ranges from $135 to $6,500.      For $2,500 you can get one in #3 "very good" condition,      which means it is original or an older restoration that      looks almost new, runs perfectly, and will get to the next      stoplight just a few seconds behind the Boss and GS but      using half the gas.    </p>    <h3>      Fuel Economy and Used Cars    </h3>    <p>      But don't old cars waste limited petroleum and pollute our      air and water? Yes and no. Nobody should operate a      gas-guzzling, oil-dripping, smoke-billowing Bunker except      to get it to a mechanic or junkyard. But, when run hot over      country distances and at road speed, a properly      maintained-and-tuned older car is cleaner than a poorly      maintained new model.    </p>    <p>      Only when large numbers of city cars stop and go without      driving far enough to warm up, then idle at stoplights or      inch along in urban gridlock, do pollutants buildup (and      when EGR valves open, computers earn their keep, and      catalytic converters light).    </p>    <p>      Across this huge nation, only Los Angeles County in      California continues to have intractable air quality      problems. Still, the EPA wants to impose the (super-strict,      yet ineffective) California standard nationwide-when      bath nuisance value and cost far exceeds any environmental      benefit.    </p>    <p>      As for water pollution, the lead is out of gasoline and the      rest is up to us. Years ago I drained antifreeze onto the      ground while old oil sat around in leaky milk jugs. I use      the new Sierra Brand of nontoxic/biodegradable antifreeze      containing propylene glycol and will try to have that      recycled/rejuvenated annually rather than changing it each      year, Our town dump accepts old oil for recycling. If they      didn't I'd pay a gas station to dispose of it, which is      mandated by law in 21 states and should be everywhere, as a      single 4-quart oil change can pollute a million gallons of      water.    </p>    <p>      Fuel efficiency is largely a function of vehicle weight,      and weight a function of size and relative content of heavy      steel vs. light-weight aluminum or composite. The current      economy champ is the Japanese-import Geo Metro, a tiny,      thin-steel unibody model that gets 55+mpg and weighs only      1,621 lb. But look at one after a wreck? They fold up like      tin cans. I wouldn't drive one as long as there are      I8-wheelers on the road.    </p>    <p>      You can do very well by being fuelflow conscious; keep      speed low and the gear as high as you can so long as the      engine doesn't labor. Pretend there's a raw egg between      your foot and the accelerator pedal; a gentle pressure      won't break it, but let go or jerk hard and Krakk!    </p>    <p>      Here are four things you can do to reduce your older      vehicle's pollution potential by 70% or more without      harming performance.    </p>    <p>      1. Fuel can gush out to soften tarmac and evaporate into      the air when air is trapped in an old-style unvented filler      pipe. So, listen as you fill. When capacity is about      reached, the sound will change to a gurgle and then to a      higher pitched roar as fuel rushes up the pipe. At the      first change in tone, release the lever.    </p>    <p>      2. To burn crankcase fumes, install a PCV (positive      crankcase ventilation) system. At any auto dealership, buy      a PCV valve and grommet and a PVC aircleaner filter and      grommet for a modern auto of your engine's size. Drill      holes to install the valve in a valve cover, and the filter      in the aircleaner and connect with fuel-proof rubber hose.      Look at any new car for an example.    </p>    <p>      3. Reduce exhaust emissions by installing a catalytic      converter (a pair or a dual-in/dual-out unit for old-time      real dual exhausts). Have a genuine exhaustsystem expert      (not a mufflershop) locate and install it in your exhaust      system so it will heat up enough to fire off but be      shielded so as not to burn the vehicle or ignite leaf piles      in the gutter. The best deal I know comes from Don's Hot      Rod Shop, 2811 N. Stone Ave, Tucson, AZ 85705. Don sells      universal free-flow converters for 2"' to 2 1/2" -diameter      pipes for about $80. Converters for a muscle car's 3" pipes      cost more. Call 1800-888-8892.    </p>    <p>      4. Treat your car or truck as you should any tool and take      care of it. Especially, keep it in tune-so that the      correct gas and air charge gets a hot spark to detonate      inside the engine at the right time. Hire it done for $50      if you must, better to get a book, wrench set, feeler      gauges, timing light, and tachometer and learn how to keep      your car in tune in your own garage. Go to Instant-Lube or      buy ramps, grease gun and a drain-pan and change engine oil      and filter and lubricate from one end to another each 2,500      miles or two months. Inspect, clean and gap spark plugs and      points, change air and fuel filters every three months.      Change all lubricants, points, plugs and distributor cap      and adjust valves each six months. Perform all other      routine maintenance twice as often as repair manuals direct      (at half the recommended mileage). Replace all belts,      ignition wires, fuel pump and coil every 20,000 miles or      two years, all hoses and water pump every 40,000 miles or      five years and replace battery six months short of its      recommended service life.    </p>    <p>      After investing less than $250 for tools and then an hour's      work and $50 every month after that, you will have a      good-starting, reliable, clean-burning vehicle and preempt      99% of problems before they happen.    </p>    <h3>      Checking Out An Older Used Car    </h3>    <p>      The old saw "Buying a used car is buying another driver's      problems" needn't be true. As much of the old iron has been      well maintained as abused. First, decide in advance not to      believe a word from an owner or used car salesman. Even the      most honest will gloss a "unit's" bad points and exaggerate      the good-if he/she knows them; auction vehicles at      used car lots come as is without any history.    </p>    <p>      A few quick checks will give you an idea of the vehicle's      life story. Walk around the car. Kick the tires if you      want, but also check tread for degree and evenness of wear.      Scalloped edges or worn shoulders indicate suspension      problems. Push down hard on one rear fender; if the car      bounces more than three times it needs shocks, which is      minor, but suggests neglect.    </p>    <p>      Look underneath. A rusty muffler and exhaust can be      replaced easily and a rusty gas tank or broken spring with      effort, but a rusty or fractured frame can't. Unless      wrecked at some time, the frame will be even and straight      in all dimensions. It can have no deep, flaky rustcalled      rot. Doors, trunk, and hood should mate well with body; if      not, it may have been wrecked. Go around the body, tapping.      A dead THUNK! means rust or a wreck that's been patched      with fiberglass and resin (Bondo) that won't last.      Patchwork paint tells that body panels have been replaced.    </p>    <p>      Wear of (original) seats, floor mat, and pedals will      indicate age. Look under trunk and floor mats and dig under      bubbly paint for hidden rust. Light surface rust can be      ground off and filled in. Fenders, doors, trunk, hood, and      floors can usually be re placed. But, it can be nigh      impossible to repair deep rust on any visible part that      can't be unbolted: where water pools around windows, in      angular dents and crevasses, in compound curves in the top      or main body shell. Look hard under chrome trim, rubber      gaskets, gas fillers and rings around lights. You can have      sections cut out of junkyard cars and welded into yours,      but it isn't cheap. Find your vehicle in the body-parts      section of JC Whitney or a special interest car parts      catalog: rust on any parts they don't sell may be terminal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UPKEEP HEADACHES?</strong><br />      Investing $50 a month on maintenance will prevent 90% of      car problems before they happen.    </p>    <p>      Before you start the engine, open the hood and remove the      oil-filler cap. If the underside is caked with a thick,      black residue, the oil has not been changed frequently      enough over many years. Even if the engine compartment has      been newly steam-cleaned, the engine (and the rest of the      mechanicals as well) may have been sorely neglected. Look      down the sides of the engine for the oil filter-on      newer vehicles, a painted-metal cylinder the size and shape      of a pickle jar. The paint should be bright under a minimum      of road grime. If it is caked solid with road splash, is      rusted, or dull with age, it's been in far too      long-unless it has been in prolonged storage.    </p>    <p>      Pull the dipstick. Fresh. light-colored oil is new (perhaps      just changed to mask ne glect you discovered from a cruddy      filler cap;. Darkcolored oil is acceptable so long as it is      translucent. If it is opaque, it has been in too      long-or the engine is worn. Smell. A burned odor      suggests bearings are running hot, which means they are      grinding themselves to iron filings.    </p>    <p>      Look in the radiator. Coolant should be that      iridescent-green antifreeze color and clear. If it's pink,      it is years too old. Murky coolant and rustcolored gum      clogging the inside of the cap suggest poor maintenance.      Look around the engine and up on the firewall where heater      hoses enter. Unless it's around ends of easily replaced      hoses, crusty white residue or coolant green on the      radiator and around gaskets indicates leaks. Caked-on grime      anywhere indicates an oil leak. Thick grime all over      suggests a poorly maintained vehicle.    </p>    <p>      Be sure the engine has been getting dust-free air. Look at      the donut-shaped air filter element and smaller breather      filters inside the air cleaner. If gray and clogged with      leaves and bugs, they've not been changed often enough.      Sheet metal of the air-cleaner housing inside the filter      should be pristine except, perhaps, for a thin oil coating.      Look down the carb. Throat and plates inside may be      discolored but should be shiny and clean. Fine grit      anywhere suggests that the engine has been breathing      sand-not good.    </p>    <p>      Now, turn the key till dash comes alive, but don't start      engine. Temperature, oil pressure, battery gauges should      jerk alive or idiot lights come on, Depress accelerator      once hard, release, and turn key to start the engine.      (Unless it's just out of prolonged storage. Then spark      should be disconnected and engine preoiled by cranking with      starter till oil pressure is reached. If owner-just      fires up along stored engine, the vehicle may have been      abused in other ways.) Don't be surprised if an owner tells      you a trick or two needed to get it going. Old cars have      their quirks-okay so long as safety isn't compromised      and it's not as much bother as my Jeep that would start      fine but had to have the voltage regulator set manually      before it would charge. If I neglected to do it, the engine      would run till the battery was dead and I'd need a tow.    </p>    <p>      Oil pressure should rise immediately to 50 lb or the oil      light will go out in seconds. Listen very carefully. If      engine sounds fine, but pressure is below 20 lb, the      problem can be extreme wear, a failing oil pump (rare), a      bad gauge or pressure sensor, or a bad electrical      connection. A loud clatter that is slow to stop suggests      the problem is poor oil pressure or bad valves-either one a      sign of a worn engine (unless it's a diesel, which will      always clatter on start-up). A tick-tick that gets softer      with oil indicates minor valve problems. An intermittent      clank or deep clunk may be bad bearings and is serious. A      little blue smoke at the tail pipe that lasts briefly      indicates the slightly worn piston rings expected in old      engines. If smoke doesn't stop, rings are too worn to be      legal. Brief black smoke can probably be cured with a good      tuneup; white smoke may be nothing but water accumulated in      the exhaust system.    </p>    <p>      Pull a car-length away, stop, and look for puddles under      where the car sat. With engine running, check automatic      transmission fluid-filler will be located in engine      compartment or under front floor. It should be full and a      clear pink color. Sniff it. Opaque, brown, or      burned-smelling fluid means about $700 worth of trouble.    </p>    <p>      Try all the knobs. Test all gears forward and back. Try the      steering wheel for more than a 1/4-turn of play. Test the      emergency brake by putting it on hard and trying to go      forward; the brake should stall the engine. Then go for a      ride. Get up to operating temperature and highway speed.      Thin blue smoke at cruise-but especially great      billows on acceleration or deceleration-is burning      oil. If brakes pull in one direction or chatter, stop and      accelerate in reverse, then stop hard. This will fix newer      (self-adjusting) brakes if they're in good shape. If the      steering pulls, if the car wanders or front end jiggles or      vibrates, there's a suspension problem.    </p>    <p>      An automatic transmission should transition smoothly      through its two or three forward gears. If it clanks when      going in reverse check under the car to see if the noise      isn't a $20 U-joint. If in the tranny or rear differential      (or in front on a 4WD), it may be serious. Any grinding,      hesitation, orjerking indicates a problem. If clutch pedal      needs long travel to engage and then shudders, the clutch      is nearly worn out. A clanking sound on releasing the      clutch may be a universal joint on the drive shaft, or may      indicate a bad throwout bearing. A humming in the rear end      (be sure it's not snow tires) is not good; a grinding sound      is bad. Humms or clicks on a 4WD truck can be lockout hubs      or the transfer case. These problems needn't stop you from      taking the vehicle, but they should influence the price. If      not already factored into price, a problem in axle, engine,      or tranny is worth a $1,000 price reduction. A bad clutch      or front end is worth $500 off, twice that with rack-      and-pinion or power steering. A paint job is worth $500. A      badly dented or rusted door, fender, hood, trunk, or rocker      panels, $250 apiece.    </p>    <p>      Finally, if you like the vehicle and it costs more than you      are willing to lose, go to Midas for a free check of the      muffler and brakes. Watch them while they do it and keep      their estimate for price negotiating. Then take it to a      mechanic and a panel-knocker you trust and pay for a      drive-train and body-work diagnosis and estimate of repairs      to a safe, road-worthy, and cosmetically acceptable      condition. Make your decision and negotiate.    </p>    <p>      You have to be willing to dicker. Dealers have about 1/3 of      the price to play with. Private owners can ask anything      ...but always ask more than they expect to get and will      almost always come down if you are resolute. Offer the      lowest price you have the gall to mention and go up      reluctantly.    </p>        <h3>      Restoring the "Well Used" Vehicle    </h3>    <p>      You are going to: pay, at least $100/month to own a car,      whether it is old or new. It's a "pay me now or pay me      later" proposition. Buying new, you pay for all-new      parts all at once. Buying used, you replace wearing parts      one at a time before they threaten to break down. Plan well      and you'll do the work when you want to (not when the car      fails).    </p>    <p>      Buy, a vehicle that can be repaired easily and cheaply. For      Mustangs, Camaros, VW. Bugs, 1/4-ton pickups, and other      popular vehicles, every part but the frame and body shell      are available at a reasonable price. Look in, the catalogs,      or call local body shops..    </p>    <p>      Whether you or a paid pro does the work, you'll have to      know what your car needs and what your options are. Read      car-restoration books froth the library: Subscribe to the      old-and performance-car magazines and catalogs. You'll      surely need same help, and every country town has genuine      and self-styled experts in fixing up old cars. Ask anyone      you see driving an older vehicle who they recommend for      mechanical acid body work-and more important, whom      and where to avoid.    </p>    <p>      P arts may take same searching. You can save time and money      if you buy a parts car to cannibalize or scout around for a      car like yours that someone got tired of working on and      thats being, "parted out". Use (well-) rebuilt alternators,      starters, and, other wearing parts and junkyard body parts      when you can.    </p>    <p>      With other than for a "numbers-matching" show car,      substitute modern parts if possible, Box example, GM      refused for decades to spend more than $2.00 for an,      electric clock-even for Cadillacs-so clocks      never lasted long. Using Velcro, I suck a rather than buy a      "NOS" GM Clock movement listed in the catalog NOS means.      Old Stock: original unused repair parts that hate been      stored for decades. You pay for the storage a NOS clock      won't work for long if it works at all.    </p>    <p>      The more you replace of a failed or worn system the cheaper      it will be in the long run. A rebuilt Chevy 350 engine      block and heads a casts $754-1,500 stock, $2,500 and up for      an over-bored block, bigger pistons, a hotter cam, and more      horsepower. Not cheap, but less money than diagnosing and      repairing an endless succession of problems. While the      engine is out of the car, replace clutch parts ($100 +      labor), and as much else as you can afford. Have your carb      rebuilt by a pro ($10 p.l.) or buy a rebuilt ($120) stock      carb or hi- performance replacement Garb ($2500) and intake      manifold ($100) Bolt on a new water pump ($40), a fuel pump      ($25); timing gears and chain ($30), and other parts that      aren't part of the rebuild.    </p>    <p>      Don't fix just one worn or leaky brake-do`em all      while the tools are out and the car is off the ground. And,      rebuild the whole thing: new hoses and wheel cylinders,      backing plates, rebuilt calipers, and new drums and rotors.    </p>    <p>      It is usually cheaper to replace whole body parts than cut      out rust, weld in patches, and smooth with lead.      <em>(Don't</em> use fiberglass/plastic-Bondo-to      patch a great vehicle.) But, shop hard. A used door that      may rust out in a year costs $250 at a junkyard. A NOS      steel door shell can cost more than that, while a new      Taiwan-made door shell costs $95 and new door and window      gaskets about $20. Prime and paint the metal inside and      out, and move window and latch mechanism yourself Se sure      the drain holes at bottom are open, and the door will last      for decades.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPECIAL CARE</strong><br />      After $1,500 in repairs to his used car, my friend told me,      "Tell your readers to check their fluids."    </p>    <h3>      Driving the Older Car    </h3>    <p>      Until and unless it's fully rebuilt, treat your own      "experienced" car gently-even if (or perhaps because)      it only has a few thousand miles on the odometer. Time      takes its toll as much as wear and if a car has been stored      for a while, the bill can come due all at once. Recall my      friend with the white Caddy convertible? When I told him I      was writing this article, he said, "Tell your readers to      check their fluids." Turns out that he'd treated the car as      if it were as new as it looked. In the first month the car      "blew up" on him four times; he had to repair the radiator      and replace all the hoses ($300), replace four new-looking      but 12-year-old tires ($425), broken fan belts ($30 plus a      big towing bill), and the automatic transmission when he      let it run out of fluid ($700, used). His $4,500 bargain      had cost another $1,500. And, stranded four times by sudden      parts failure, he was losing confidence.    </p>    <p>      Buying an old car to free yourself of monthly payments and      costly high-tech repairs comes at a cost of its own. If a      car's been sitting long, hoses and belts will split and oil      seals will dry out and leaksometimes suddenly and      catastrophically. For the first 1,000 miles, keep fresh      newspaper on the floor under the wheels and drive train.      Before you leave, check for fresh puddles. Always check      engine oil, auto-trans, brake, and power-steering fluid,      plus coolant with every tank of gas. Till leaks reveal      themselves and are repaired (some will self-repair in      time), carry a complete fill-up of all fluids in the trunk.    </p>    <p>      Old components are "tender," so drive gently. If a big old      car like the white Caddy hit a pothole hard enough to bend      an axle, a used replacement could cost almost $1,000      installed. But so could the axle on the 1969,      127"-wheelbase Chrysler Imperial Crown that you got by      swapping a half-bushel of zucchini.		</p>	<h3>		      Spend A Little To Save A Lot    </h3>    <p>      Never use the lowest priced, 87-octane, "economy" gasoline      except in an "Iron Duke" or other industrial-strength      four-banger. Especially in smog pockets during winter,      where the EPA requires methanol and other "oxygenators" be      added to reduce C02 emisssions, the cheap stuff gives new      EPA cars indigestion, and will barely run an older car.      "Pinging," dieseling, and knocking can get so bad they      could damage tender old pistons. Use midgrade in small      engines, premium in the big ones routinely, and premium in      every old engine in winter.    </p>    <p>      Even if they do look brand new, replace all heater and      radiator hoses and fan/water pump/accessory-drive belts.      And check for proper tension after a few days. Repack wheel      bearings and install new grease seals, and grease      everything. Old water pumps, generators, distributors,      steering columns, and pedals have grease cups or zerk      fittings that need service, but Lightning-Lube may not have      charts that go that far back. Buy a reprint of the original      owner's manual from a mail-order catalog, get the full-size      Chilton Repair Manual at a good auto-parts store, and learn      how to maintain your own vehicle. Don't use additives such      as top-lube in the oil or water-pump lube in coolant unless      factory-recommended.    </p>    <p>      While the vehicle is still a novelty, wirebrush or grind      all visible rust to bare metal and spray with primer.      Protect with paint right away, as primer absorbes water and      encourages rust; a good parts store can custom-mix quarts,      dip tubes, or spray cans of your actual (faded) color from      paint chips. Replace seal beam headlight elements and all      other lamps; keep still-good old ones for emergency use.      Change all fluids: coolant, engine, tranny, and      differential oils plus the transfer case on 4WD vehicles.      Examine old lubricants for signs of wear: metal chips,      grit, burned smell, water, or discoloration to anticipate      problems. Especially look for water in oil or oil in water.      This means a bad head gasket or worse; have it fixed before      it becomes terminal. Have an experienced pro drain and      replace the brake fluid, as it's easy to break a bleeder      fitting. (Remind him how old the car is and to use a torch      to break threads if they don't part with gentle pressure.)    </p>    <p>      Use the best-quality fluids you can find. I buy a gallon of      distilled water from a pharmacy to mix half and half with      an tifreeze (even when I'm in Florida) to retard cooling      system rust and keep minerals in tap water from gumming up      the radiator. The new artificial lubricants are expensive      but worth it. But, ignore their claims of long lube life.      Changing engine oil and filter every two months or 3,000      miles and other lubricants every 9,000 miles or 12 months      can double an engine's working lifetime.    </p>    <p>      Old finishes, interiors, and underbody can also deteriorate      quickly with exposure to sun, rain, or use. Wash and      hand-wax the paint and chrome and don't go near car-wash      detergents unless you rewax immediately. Use the proper      conditioners for metal, plastic, vinyl, or leather      interiors, carpets or floor mats, and convertible tops.      Power-wash (never steam-clean) the engine compartment and      underbody. Let dry for a day or two; then have      undercarriage, wheel wells, and sheet metal of the engine      compartment hot-oil-treated against corrosion. Re-oil every      October. Unless you strip to bare metal, prime and paint      with rust-eating finishes. Never undercoat an old car; rust      will keep gnawing away, protected by the coating.		</p>		<h3>	      Let's Make Automobiles Fun Again    </h3>    <p>      It may not be politically correct to say so, but you and I      agree, don't we, that tooling around in a fine old American      vehicle with a free-breathing V8 out front is just about      the most satisfying way there is to convert petroleum into      forward motion?    </p>    <p>      More and more, repair of still-warranteed <em>new cars</em>      entails replacing expensive, nonrebuildable      "modules"-including entire transmissions and engines.      From Detroit's perspective, it can be cheaper to replace      the robot-built 32-valve/dohc, etc., aluminum V-8 than pay      an automotive technician (not a mechanic anymore) to repair      it. If GM, Ford, or Chrysler wants to replace rather than      repair a $10,000 engine, fine. They can afford it. But, a      postwarranty owner who buys the car used for $15,000 or      $7,000 or $2,500 can't.    </p>    <p>      I suspect that we're approaching the era of throwaway      automobiles, and in another 10 to 20 years we'll see      1,400-Ib carbon fiber cars with "leanburn engines" that get      100 mpg and are able to go 100 mph. (Don't laugh; GM      already has just such a prototype.) Wonder if they'll      warrantee them for 100,000 miles, then scrap and recycle      what's left?    </p>    <p>      For 20 years now, we've walked rather than driven, recycled      everything and cut wood to conserve energy, and we're not      done yet. So, let's spend some of our energy savings and      appreciate some remarkable automotive achievements of the      past and live a little ...just for an hour or so.    </p>    <h3>      Part II: Old Iron<br />     The pick of the crop, from     liveries to limos    </h3>    <p>      Following is a list of cars and trucks you can buy well and      properly used and drive forever. A hundred thousand miles      is the traditional automotive death knell, but it isn't      relevant for any well-maintained vehicle older than 10      years. Autos don't have to be junked when the odometer      turns over; if rebuilt as needed any vehicle can go forever      ...like aircraft.		</p>	<h3>		      Trucks    </h3>    <p>      High-powered 1-ton "Duallys," Crew Cabs, 3/4-ton pickups,      Chevy Suburbans, and IH Travelalls are great for heavy      hauling. But for gentlest ride, greatest selection of parts      and accessories and lowest repair and operating costs, get      a full-size 1/4-ton pickup or      Blazer/Bronco/Trallduster-style utility-little but a      short-bodied truck with a covered bed. Chevy/GMCs are most      popular, Ford next, Dodge third.    </p>    <p>      A pickup truck is the most elemental vehicle made and is      easiest to restore. Everything unbolts from the frame in      minutes. Look in the JC <em>Whitney catalog</em> to test      price and availability of body panels, engine, tranny, and      running-gear kits, inside trim. and accessories for makes/      models/years you are considering. One thousand dollars will      buy a drivable truck needing restoration, $2,500 a good      original or older restoration, $3,500 to $5,000 a nice late      '70s Chevy C-10 or Ford F-100. Four-wheeldrive, big      engines, and power options cost more and a whole lot more      later to maintain or restore.    </p>    <p>      Don't try to restore a farm truck ...or before you do read      John Jerome's '77 book Truck. Municipal and utility company      vehicles are often well-maintained, lowmileage bargains.      Tradesmen's, retail delivery, other business trucks vary,      but many are run out under a new-looking paint job. Look to      buy a suburbanite's pet truck that's been pampered; many      are commuters and their 100,000 miles are more like 50,000.    </p>    <p>      Sports trucks are big sellers today. The original, Chevy's      '50s Apache CameoCarrier is a classic. The next version,      the Chevy El Camino/GM Caballero is an automobile with a      pickup bed in back. Ford's Ranchero is similar but has a      bad reputation.    </p>    <p>      Some '73-'87 GMs have twin tanks located outboard of the      frame rails. Rarely, but often enough, they rupture in a      collision. Publicity has reduced resale value, and as of      this writing, GM is offering some owners of such models a      chit for $1,000 toward a new truck. I suspect that public      pressure will force them to rebate cash lest Ralph Nader      decides to take the case. Keep tuned; if you're quick, you      may be able to buy a good truck cheap, cash in the rebate,      and use it to buy a safer fuel tank, four new tires, and a      stereo.    </p>    <p>      Today's small trucks from design-leader Toyota, Dodge's      Dakota, the Chevy S- series, and Ford Rangers are fine if      you don't need to haul wallboard or plywood. But early      minitrucks from all makers are underpowered, rust prone,      and usually beat by now. They aren't much protection in a      collision either.    </p>    <p>      Vans are hazardous to your health. Oldstyle front-engine,      rear-drive vans are top-heavy, light-tailed, and prone to      spin and roll-especially when driven unloaded on wet      pavement, ice, or snow. If you must have a van, your best      bet-despite its smog controls-is a stripped      cargo version of the Chevy Astro van. You can get them with      4WD, a real advantage for the van format. Sold widely for      commercial use, it has a strong ladder frame, automatic      transmission, a simple and economical four- or six-cylinder      engine with an even simpler rear-wheel drive. Every inch of      undercarriage is accessible, so there aren't any crannies      to rust. You can get a dent-and-rust-free '85 to '89 with a      150,000-mile engine for $1,000 and rebuild the whole thing      for $2,000. Add a pair of comfortable bucket seats and a      radio, have steel "L"-beam bumpers cut, drilled, and bolted      on front and back, put 100 lb of bagged gravel or concrete      blocks over each wheel, and it will be better than any      other van, new or old.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN AMERICAN CLASSIC</strong><br />      A pickup truck is the most elemental vehicle made and is      the easiest to restore.    </p>    <h3>      Jeeps and Small Utilities    </h3>    <p>      The best go-anywhere vehicle ever made is a      '40s-to-early-'60s Jeep. It's easy to repair and restore,      too; every part goes on or comes off with a hard pull or a      few bolts. Trouble is, you'll have to do a lot of bolting.      Jeep was passed from Willys-Overland to American Motors to      Chrysler as each was going bloke. Clutches wear, doors fall      off, fender/body joints and floors rust, starters and      alternators break, and windshield-wiiper mechanisms fall      apart. Nine hundred dollars will get you a running Jeep For      $2,500 it will, run well and have a top and seats, and for      $4,000 it will-come-with rebulft engine and      running gear. Test-drive carefully; off road use can ruin      running gear and looser all those bolts. Then drive on      slopes with care; Jeeps, especially with oversize' tires,      have a higher center of gravity than vans and roll easily.    </p>    <p>      Aluminum-bodied (rustproof) British, L and Rovers have      conquered the outbacks of the world, but are notoriously      prone to breakdowns, and parts are hard to locate. Toyota's      copy, the tand Cruiser, is a more practical choice, though      many are kept by city people as pets. A $4,500 asking price      for a low-mileage late '70s FJ40 "TOY" isn't unusual, and      I've seen prices as high as $7,000. IH Scouts haven't been      made for decades and the body metal was rust prone, but      they are good little plow-vehicles if you can find one      that's been rebodied and rustproofed and know a parts      source. The same can be said of Ford's original Bronco.    </p>    <h3>      Limos, Ambulances, Flower Cars,      Military Vehicles    </h3>    <p>      All these vehicles have been garaged and meticulously      maintained, and often come with low mileage at bargain      prices: $1,900 is a typical asking price, but the market is      thin. Offer $650 and go up in $10 dribbles and reluctantly.      They are good for a really big family ...but long and low      and unsuitable for bad country roads, and they come in a      limited choice of colors: black or white. Check underneath      for frame rot even if the topside looks new. You can always      dress as a chauffeur and make a few extra bucks on prom      nights.    </p>    <p>      You've seen those magazine ads reading: "JEEPS $100." It's      a gyp-they're selling info on how to get free      applications to receive free flyers advertising government      auctions. The military sells redundant equipment in odd      lots, and the carcass of a cannibalized Jeep can indeed go      that cheap, but probably not.    </p>    <p>      Surplus brokers are still bringing Korean War trucks to      market: '46 to '56 B series Dodge Power Wagon 1-Ton/4WD      pickups-the square-nosed "Army Trucks" like my friend      Ben Perkins' tow truck. Simplicity personified, they only      have one gauge-a speedo-in the dash. Value      ranges from $350 for a basket case to $8,000 for a #1 show      vehicle; $4,500 will get you a good one. Vietnam-era      vehicles are also appearing. You'll spend $2,500 for a      serviceable '70s Chevy or Dodge 3/4-ton/4WD pickup to      $4,500 for a good one. Most have camouflage paint, low      miles, and were well maintained. Be sure they have not been      stripped of essential parts and have road-legal lights,      fenders, front bumper, and exhaust. Modern Desert-Storm-era      (sand-tones) paint is multiband radar absorbent, by the      way. Some advantage against "Smokeys" if you can coax the      truck over 55 mph.		</p>	<h3>		      Sports and Foreign Cars    </h3>    <p>      Early Corvettes and two-seater Thunderbirds are collector      cars. It is too expensive to restore high-mileage Mercedes,      Volvos, or MGs for daily driving. But do check out Datsun's      pre-1970 MG-like Roadster convertibles and '70 to '73      240Zs. The original "Z-car" has a tough but lively      six-cylinder engine with dual carbs that anyone can adjust,      excellent handling and brakes, along with the look of a      short E-Jag. Coming from Honda Country, it was never taken      seriously and you can get a surprisingly good one for      $1,000, a great one for $5,000, but look hard for frame and      body rot. In '74 the Zcars began to put on weight, but the      260s and 280s are still cheap and fun.    </p>    <p>      Volkswagons didn't disappear after Woodstock but are alive      and well and living in California. Beetles, Transporters      (Buses), and Karmann-Ghias are still the cheapest wheels      around. You can get an all-new (remanufactured) Bug for      $6,500.<br />      <br />      A good used one costs $2,500 to $1,500. Asking price for a      so-so but driveable Bug is maybe half that, but my son Sam      got a $700-priced Super Beetle for $150. A like-new "Thing"      (civilian version of the 1950's W. German "Jeep") or a      fully restored Bus will go for $3,500. Good Ghia hardtops      cost little more than Bugs, but convertibles are getting      pricey. A rebuilt 1,600 engine costs as little as $500 and      you can switch engines in an hour. In any VW, watch out for      rust in the floorpan and hiding under paint around doors      and fenders. You can find VW mechanics in any city, or      spend $20 for John Muir's zany book <em>How to</em> Keep      Your VW Alive and do it yourself. VW shops sell      accessories, hot-rod, and dune buggy kits. Get a copy of      <em>HOT VWs</em> Magazine for sources.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of rear engines, you might look at the Corvair,      the '60-'69 rear-engine, midsize semisporty Chevrolet that      Ralph Nader pilloried in his book: Unsafe At Any Speed.      I've seen persuasive evidence that Nader fudged his data      and that Corvairs were no worse than Ford Falcons or other      small cars of the day. Ironically, Nader's success (he      nailed GM again when they put private eyes on him)      curtailed Detroit's interest in selling America on      "downsized" cars 20 years before the Arab oil embargo      forced them on us. A pity. A cult car among the Rush      Limbaugh crowd, the Corvair is cute, sporty, and you'll      only pay $2,500 for a good hard top, $1,000 more for a      convertible. A '66 Monza Spyder ragtop with the 140-hp      engine is right perky, and a good #3/#4 goes for $4,500.      Get the stickiest tires you can, put weight in the trunk to      hold the front wheels down, and don't prove Ralph correct      by taking curves too fast.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      John Vivian's Wheels    </h3>    <p>      My own vehicle to drive into the next century? I'm taking      my own advice and refurbishing a Chevy pickup, It's one I      bought new in 1978, the last year before emission control      & I put on a cap to protect the bed, and remember      telling Nat Varnot when he sold it to me: "I'll be buried      in this truck:' I haven't had the need yet, but time did      pass and road salt and sea water took its toll till rusted      doors and fenders failed State-of-Maine inspection. Then a      power steering hose and the brake booster went so it wasn't      even safe as a woods truck. It sat out back for a year or      two, but only has 85,000 miles, so is getting a new life.      Below is a generalized restoration estimate. Mechanic's      labor is overestimated in both time and cost-at a generous      $50/hr. and is included in totals. I put DIY where I'll do      all or same of the work.    </p>    <p>      I'll have the body work done immediately and do the rest      when I can afford it. I factored in $1,000 for truck and      $400 for rubber into the total. Do clutch and radiator work      while the engine is out? The total is $7,000-about what a      #1 `78 show truck would sell for now. I could never get      that much for this one, but I'm comparing it with cost of a      new version: $22 ,000. Maybe I'll rebuild again and detail      it for show when late-'70s trucks become classics in      another decade.    </p>		<div class="image">      <img src="../images/143-034-01tab.jpg" alt="143-034-01tab.jpg" width="352" height="469" />    </div>		</div>        <h3>      Plain Vanilla Cars    </h3>    <p>      If you need a small, sturdy, and economical car for      commuting, consider a Chevy Chevette/Pontiac 1000. With      full frame, rear drive, and bulletproof Pontiac "Iron Duke"      four-cylinder engines, they're miniature examples of      Detroit design at its best. They weren't introduced till      '76, so all have emissions controls, but they are simple,      reliable, and cheap at $100 to $800. I know of one Iron      Duke that ran for a thousand miles with no oil pressure.      Early Chevettes had problems, and junk yards are full of      them-providing plenty of parts for the mid-to-late      '80s models that will run forever if you correct minor      problems quickly. A clutch will last 100,000 miles if kept      adjusted. They're great little snow cars with spiked snow      tires, but put concrete blocks in the trunk for traction.    </p>    <p>      The dowdiest but sturdiest passenger vehicles in the world      are the 2 1/2-ton cabs and civilian sedans and wagons      produced by Checker from '60 through '82 without a design      change. Nothing about them is magic; they are just simple      and extremely rugged. Cadillac-expensive when new, a      typical #3/#4 sedan of any model year sells for about      $2,500 and a wagon for $2,700. Don't even consider an      ex-cab, but get a consumer model-with an      eight-cylinder engine if you can. Most stock Chrysler      running gear, but body parts can be hard to locate.		</p>	<h3>		      White Elephants    </h3>    <p>      The Big Three all offered humongous sedans, coupes, and      more sporty hardtops with large-bore engines and a squashy      ride. Remember the car in "The Blues Brothers"? It jumped a      half-open draw bridge, dodged the Chicago Police and the      Illinois National Guard, only to self-destruct just as      Elwood and Jake completed their "Mission From God." It was      a '74 Dodge Monaco Police Special with a Hemi. You can get      a better-preserved only slightly less powerful one today      for $500.    </p>    <p>      I've already cited the joys and sorrows of owning a      pristine, $4,500 1970 Cadillac convertible. A Caddy      two-door hardtop or sedan in similar shape costs $1,500 to      $2,500. Hardtopped Lincoln Continentals, Chrysler      Imperials, and '67 and later Ford T 'Birds cost about the      same. These cars go cheap because they are seen as      gas-guzzlers and too expensive to repair as they approach      100,000 miles. My son Sam and I disagree.    </p>    <p>      In 1983 when he was still learning to drive, Sam invested      $65 of his paper-route savings in a great, low-slung 1970      Pontiac GranPrix with a 446 Big Block with a 466 carb and      automatic everything. It had at least 120,000 miles when he      got it, was kinda ratty if you looked hard, and spewed soot      when started ...but it did start every time. And it ran      clean and economically enough if he kept his foot off the      accelerator.    </p>    <p>      You can get a GranPrix, Ford Torino, boat-tailed Buick      Riviera, or other luxury coupe in better shape than Sam's      '70 for about $1,000, or in great shape for $2,500. Just      now entering college after leaving the Army with a chest      full of medals and a bum hip thanks to Desert Storm, Sam      needs an easier-entering, softer-riding vehicle than the      '78 Blazer and '69 Porsche he had been driving. He just      bought-you guessed it-a '72 Grand Prix (a "J"      model, without the potentially troublesome power      accessories). For all practical purposes a "new" car, it      has 32,000 miles on a rebuilt 454 CID, 20-mpg Small Block      V-8. All rust is repaired and it has a new exhaust &      brakes and a near-perfect white vinyl interior. It does      have patchwork paint from body repairs, but it only cost      $950. The closest new model is Pontiac's V-6-powered G(T)P      It gets 25 miles to the gallon and comes with new paint but      costs $24,050 more than the '72. That's a lot for a paint      job.    </p>    <p>      How'd you like a "modern" front-wheel drive but with      old-style luxury. Look over the '66 to '72 Olds Toronado      sports coupes. Not many were made; those that survived have      had early FWD problems upgraded but suffer from a stigma.      So, a good #4 can be had for about $3,000 and a very good      #3 for under $5,000. Replacement CV joints and other parts      are becoming more readily available; I'd bet that the      '68-'70s will become classics.    </p>    <p>      Then there are the dull and lumbering old two-and four-door      sedans and station wagons. Sometimes the owner'll pay you      to haul "that damned old heap" out of the driveway.      Otherwise, you can get a well-preserved Ford LTD, Chevy      Monte Carlo, or Plymouth Gran Fury Brougham for around      $500. Sway and bounce common to these heavy vehicles can be      eliminated with $100 worth of new shocks and perhaps      accessory or replacement springs.    </p>    <p>      Do be leery of buying any older car for the "ice-cold A/C"      you see in ads. Old-style air conditioning units must have      their freon refrigerant renewed periodically, and the      ozone-hole-eating/CFC Freon is being phased out. To date,      Du Pont hasn't developed an environmentally acceptable      substitute, and replacing the old A/C with a modern unit      can cost $1,000.    </p>    <p>      Avoid power windows, door locks, seats, and such unless the      car is grand enough that it's worth keeping them repaired;      there are no manual handles or controls if the power      systems break.		</p>	<h3>		      Muscle Car Dreamin'    </h3>    <p>      My nominees for the greatest daily-driver cars ever made      are the sporty, midsize convertibles, and two-door hardtops      of the late '60s and early '70s.    </p>    <p>      Leader of the pack is the 1964 1/2 to '73 Ford Mustang. You      can get a well-preserved late-'60s hardtop in original      condition for $1,500, or an older restoration for $2,500.      In #1 shape it's worth $12,000. Convertibles cost more; a      1969 302V8/auto with power steering, brakes and top,      rebuilt in the '80s, will go for $4,700-a fair #3/#4      asking price if the top and interior are good.    </p>    <p>      To compete with Mustang, GM built the Chevy Camaro/Pontiac      Firebird, Chrysler the Plymouth Barracuda/Dodge Challenger,      and AMC the Javelin/AMX. Like the Mustang, they all offered      a wide choice of engines and other options. Prices are      comparable to Mustang. You can get a good little Camaro      with the athletic but gas-saving (25 mpg) 305V8 for around      $2,500. Add $2,000 and you can get one with a 350, newly      restored and guaranteed to dazzle for another 20 years.    </p>    <p>      Two-door models of more conventional lines were also done      up pony style. Chevy's Cosworth Vega or Yenko Nova are      expensive limited editions. But with SS or GT trim and a      V8, Novas, Vegas, Chevelles, Ford Torinos, and others are      dandy to drive and cheaper than the better-known models.    </p>    <p>      Detroit built a few super-high-powered Pony Cars to do two      things very well: attract girls and accelerate over a      1/4-mile straightaway in under 10 seconds and over 100 mph.      They are expensive if you can find one. A #3/#4 Shelby      GT/350 Mustang convertible goes for $15,000; a #1 is worth      $50,000. The Big Three all support Performance Divisions,      so these cars will never become orphans.    </p>    <p>      Most modern muscle cars are hand built from Pony Cars.      Typical is Mark Tate's Mike Matheos-built '67 Camaro Z28      that won <em>HOT ROD Magazine's '93</em> competition for      the fastest street car in America. With a 570-cube engine,      it did the quarter in 8.2 seconds and reached 166.29 mph. A      car just a bit less Gonzo than Tate's is not prohibitively      expensive to own and operate. It'll get you to work on time      every day, then go to the drag-racing track and win      trophies on weekends for $10,000 to $35,000. Straight-ahead      performance, if not road-handling, is comparable to a      $50,000 Dodge Viper or $250,000 Ferrari.    </p>    <p>      You may rather want to build a "sleeper"...a "raider"...a      killer car under a deceptive exterior. A lady friend paid      $150 for a square-edged little '66 AMC Rambler Rebel SST      hardtop with a blown engine. She had it painted powder puff      blue and installed an over-bored Chevy Small Block with a      nitrous oxide horsepower-doubler on a beefedup drivetrain      with 9'Ford rears and a bulletproof TH400 automatic      transmission. The 2 1/4" dual exhaust is quiet, as befits a      mild-mannered librarian; however, a pair of cutout valves      (JC Whitney order #24XX162BR for $19.95 plus P&H) are      welded in the pipes just ahead of the mufflers. When in the      mood to play, the lady glides up to a light and stops      beside some stud in a Viper, Talon, Spyder, or Laser, and      bats her mantis eyes. The light changes and he pedals off      as hard as he can. She floors the 400 Short Block ...drops      nitro ...reaches semi-light-speed...and as she passes him,      she opens the cutouts and unleashes 700 cu ft/min of      unmuffled Motown thunder.    </p>    <p>      <em>For Further Information:<br /></em> To locate Sierra      antifreeze write: Safe Brands Corp., PO Box 3007, Omaha NE      68103 or call 1800-2897234.<br />      <br />      <strong>Publications</strong>    </p>    <p>      In a class by itself is <em>Hemmings Motor News.</em>      $23/year or $6.00/sample issue, PO Box 100, Bennington VT      05201 or call 1-800-227-4373.
