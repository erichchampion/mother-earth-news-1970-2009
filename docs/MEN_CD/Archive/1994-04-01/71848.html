                <p>      <strong>Bits and Pieces</strong>    </p>    	<p>		      A Turkish dog comes to the rescue of a Colorado family      plagued by mountain lions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Living with the Colorado Mountain Lion</strong>    </p>    	    <p>      For many years my family lived just outside Durango,      Colorado, surely one of the most beautiful places in the      United States to set up a household and raise children.      Armed with years of experience tending a cattle farm, we      became a ranching family and gambled on deriving all the      household income from raising beef cattle.    </p>    <p>      I was on my way to the mailbox one winter morning a few      years after we moved in, when I saw my first set of      mountain lion tracks. I was thrilled, eager to catch sight      of this "rare" and "shy" predator that I'd heard so much      about from the news and public television. How naive I was.      Just a few weeks after seeing those tracks in the snow, I      lost my first head of cattle-its 2,000 lb of bone and      muscle crisscrossed with the claw marks and jagged bite      wounds of the mountain lion.    </p>    <p>      In the months that followed, we lost thousands of dollars      in exotic livestock and on several occasions came very      close to being attacked ourselves. The lions that hunted      our property showed no fear of humans whatsoever. They      walked up our driveway in broad daylight, attacked our      animals and pets at random, and ignored our shouts, our      sticks, and our dogs as we futiley tried to drive them      away. Late one fall afternoon, a house guest of ours pulled      into our driveway only to have a lion jump onto the car      roof and paw at the windows.    </p>    <p>      We were not the only family experiencing problems. After      getting a few neighbors together to discuss our cattle      losses, I learned that my family was lucky. Our closest      neighbor, who raises Red Angus cattle, was so plagued by      lion kills that they were compelled to move their yearlings      into an enclosed pen next to their house, and to illuminate      the pen with floodlights all night long. Less than a week      after using the pen, they awakened to find every one of the      animals in the pen killed or badly maimed by lions. Last,      an acquaintance who lived some miles away told of her      husband being attacked as he bent down to open the water      spigot in his field. It was difficult to imagine that this      man posed a threat to, or cornered the lion in any way,      while he was standing in the middle of his field.    </p>    <p>      I don't intend to wage war against the mountain lion. In      their natural habitat, they are magnificent creatures. And      their reasons for a newly expressed aggression against      humans and cattle are clear; loss of natural territory to      man, combined with protection from hunting, have made the      once dwindling lion and cougar a more pronounced presence      both in the wild as well as the `burbs. But we <em>had</em>      to find a way to protect our property and children.    </p>    <p>      An answer finally came from a fellow rancher who had some      luck with guard dogs. "Our dogs have never been able to do      a thing," I replied. "One was even killed when it gave a      lion some trouble:" He assured me that the dogs he was      referring to, Anatolian shepherds, were not run-of-the-mill      housepets, but some very serious animals. He further said      that since buying his first pair of Shepherds, he hadn't      had a single loss. I was sold.    </p>    <p>      I was surprised to find that when Boaz and Tess arrived at      my house, they weren't the snarling, drooling hounds of      hell that I had anticipated, but simply large, handsome,      and surprisingly friendly dogs. Specifically bred in their      native Turkey for the purpose of defending property and      cattle against intruders only, these 150-1b. dogs identify      with owners remarkably well and are particularly gentle      around children. Furthermore, they are bred to intimidate      first and foremost, and to attack only if necessary. So      they pose little threat to those people who wander      mistakenly onto the property. Backing off will solve the      problem immediately. There were several occasions when we      know the dogs and lions faced off, because we could hear      the lion's snarls over the dogs' growling, but we never      found any dead or injured lions, a testament to how      intimidating they are.    </p>    <p>      Not only have we not suffered another lion kill, the dogs      have also been effective as protection against coyotes,      stray dogs, skunks, hawks, eagles ...even rattlesnakes. I      heartily recommend them to any home that is forced to share      space with predators as an alternative to the gun. Though      not exactly cheap at anywhere from $500 to $1,000 each,      they will pay for themselves, by saving the life of just      one head of cattle.

Under a cooperative      research and development agreement with the National      Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden Colorado, and      the New Energy Company of Indiana, some surprising advances      have been made in boosting the efficiency of the      traditional dry milling process of corn. They have      discovered a new process that makes ethanol extraction 13%      more efficient.    </p>    <p>      The traditional dry milling process breaks down the      starches in the corn kernel with enzymes and then ferments      the sugars with distiller's yeast to make ethanol. Because      the starch makes up only 72% of the corn kernel, the new      process uses the leftover stillage from the distillation      process, which contains starch, fats, fibrous material      (cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose), and protein. The      fiber is then taken from the stillage, broken into sugar,      fermented, and the ethanol is again extracted. The      remainder becomes feed.    </p>    <p>      The purpose of ethanol is not to replace gasoline, but to      make existing supplies of the fossil fuel last longer. It      could also make a significant contribution to the cause of      reducing pollution. When added to gasoline, ethanol boosts      octane and reduces carbon monoxide emissions. NREL is now      conducting experiments with a variety of resources, such as      switchgrass and trees that can be harvested at short      interval, in hopes of getting the same results. The main      problem with using the new process is that, for the time      being, the ethanol extract is more expensive than gasoline.      The cooperative's next task is to address that economic      issue. It is certainly a step in the right direction,      however.    </p>    <h3>      Saving the American Chestnut    </h3>    <p>      Those chestnuts roasting on the open fire at Christmas were      probably Italian. Thanks to a turn of the century blight-a      devastating fungus that all but wiped out the American      variety-foreign nuts have played an increasingly      large role in nationwide chestnut sales. But University of      Florida researchers say an experiment is under way that may      help pull American chestnuts out of the fire; or maybe put      them back in again. They have been successful recently in      growing a hybrid chestnut resistant to the blight. "There's      a huge potential for commercial production of chestnuts in      our country." said Gary Brinen, a UF extension agent.    </p>    <p>      Labeled the Dunstan chestnut, the hybrid was initially      developed by breeder Robert Dunstan in the 1950s by      crossing a single blight-resistant chestnut growing in Ohio      with a Chinese variety also naturally resistant. Dunstan's      grandson, R. D. Wallace, has finished development by      growing 100 acres of blight-free chestnuts in his tree      nursery in Alachua, Florida. He reports that the new      Dunstan trees produce sweet, flavorful nuts superior in      taste and size to both foreign breeds and even their      original American cousins.    </p>    <p>      Before the blight, chestnuts were an important source of      food for the early settlers, natives, and wildlife of North      America. Now Americans consume less than one ounce of      chestnuts per person annually. "One out of four trees in      North America was an American chestnut before the fungus      from Asia attacked their bark and branches in 1904, wiping      out just about every chestnut tree by the early 1940s,"      Brinen said. "We lost about 3.5 billion trees during that      time."    </p>    <p>      Active tree planters interested in information on the      Dunstan chestnut can call R. D. Wallace at 1-800-669-2067.    </p>    <p>      - Jani Spede    </p>
