        If you're sick of frequent trips to the gas station to faceever-increasing prices, you may want to speak up for realimprovements to federal fuel economy standards by contacting your<a href="http://www.congress.org" target="_blank">congressionalrepresentative</a>.<br /><br />Next week, the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote onfuel economy ? including an amendment from Representatives SherwoodBoehlert (R-N.Y.) and Edward Markey (D-Mass.). If added tolegislation under consideration, the amendment would require anincrease in mileage standards for cars and light trucks to 33 mpgby 2016 (from the current 24.6 mpg average). Driving vehicles heldto stronger fuel economy standards would save an average family$500 per year; nationwide, we would save an estimated $19 billionin fuel costs.<br /><br />According to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), severaltechnologies exist that could boost vehicles' fuel economy withoutdiminishing performance or safety. Improved fuel economy standardsare also a proven way to lessen our dependency on foreign oil. Thereduced oil demand in 2025 ? more than 2 million barrels a day ?would equal the amount we currently import from the Persian Gulf,per a study by UCS. And burning less gas would mean a significantreduction in America's contribution to global warmingpollution.<br /><br />In response to the public's rising concern over skyrocketing gasprices, the Bush administration recently asked Congress for theauthority to revise Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)standards. The administration later clarified that it wants toreplace the existing fleet-wide standards with specific standardsfor each class of vehicle. But unless size-based classificationsare accompanied by increased standards, actual vehicle fuel economyis unlikely to improve, according to UCS. Thus, the Boehlert-Markeyamendment was created to tie real improvements to vehicles' fueleconomy to any revisions of the structure of CAFE standards.<br /><br />For more information, visit the<a href="http://ucsaction.org/campaign/5_17_06_CAFE_Amendment_House/explanation" target="_blank">UCS Web site</a>.
