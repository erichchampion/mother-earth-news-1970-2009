                <p>      <strong>View Point : Reflections on the Genetic      Manipulation of Life</strong>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By barbara Kingsolver; Illustrations by Paul Mirocha		</h5>		    <p>      <strong>In the slender shoulders of the myrtle tree outside my      kitchen window, a hummingbird built her nest. It was in      April, the sexiest month, season of bud and courtship      displays, though I was at the sink washing breakfast dishes      and missing the party, or so you might think.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Then my eye caught a flicker of motion outside, and there      she was, hovering uncertainly. She held in the tip of her      beak a wisp of wadded spiderweb so tiny I wasn't even sure      it was there, until she carefully smoodged it onto the      branch. She vanished then, but in less than a minute she      was back with another tiny white tuft she stuck on top of      the first. For more than an hour she returned again and      again, increasingly confident of her mission, building up      by infinitesimal degrees a whitish lump on the      branch-and leaving me plumb in awe of the supply of      spiderwebbing on the face of the land.    </p>    <p>      I stayed at my post, washing everything I could find, while      my friend did her own housework out there. When the lump      had grown big enough-when some genetic trigger in her      small brain said, "Now, that will do"-she stopped      gathering and sat down on her little tuffet, waggling her      wings and tiny rounded underbelly to shape the blob into a      cup that easily would have fit inside my cupped hand. Then      she hovered up, inspected it from this side and that,      settled and waddled with greater fervor, hovered and      appraised some more, and dashed off. She returned with fine      filaments of shredded bark, which she wove into the webbing      along with some dry leaflets and a slap-dab or two of      lichen pressed onto the outside for curb appeal.    </p>    <p>      When she had made of all this a perfect, symmetrical cup,      she did the Most Surprising thing of all: She sat on it,      stretched herself forward, extended the unbelievable length      of her tongue and <em>licked</em> her new nest in a long,      upward stroke from bottom to rim. Then she rotated herself      a minute degree, leaned forward and licked again. I watched      her go all the way around, licking the entire nest in a      slow rotation that took 10 minutes to complete and ended      precisely back at her starting point.    </p>    <p>      Passed down from hummingbird great-grandmothers immemorial,      a spectacular genetic map in her mind had instructed her at      every step, from snipping out with her beak the first      spiderweb tuft to laying down whatever salivary secretion      was needed to accrete and finalize her essential creation.      Then, suddenly, that was that. Her busy urgency vanished,      and she settled in for the long stillness of laying and      incubation.    </p>    <p>      If you had been standing with me at my kitchen sink to      witness all this, you would likely have breathed softly, as      I did, "My God." The spectacular perfection of that nest,      that tiny tongue, that beak calibrated perfectly to the      length of the tubular red flowers from which she Sucks      nectar, taking away pollen to commit the essential act of      copulation for the plant that feeds her every piece of it      all, my God. You might be expressing your reverence for the      details of a world created in seven days, 4,004 years ago      (according to some biblical calculations), by a divine      being approximately human in shape. Or you might be      revering the details of a world created by a billion years      of natural selection acting utterly without fail on every      single life-form, one life at a time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The environmental challenges loom as something on the order      of a cancer that might well make personal allergies look      like a sneeze.</strong>    </p>    <p>      For my money the latter is the greatest show on Earth and a      church service to end all. I have never understood how      anyone could have the slightest trouble blending religious      awe with a full comprehension of the workings of life's      creation.    </p>    <p>      Charles Darwin was a religious man, blessed with an      extraordinary patience for observing nature's details, as      well as the longevity and brilliance to put it all      together. In his years of studying animate life he noticed      four things. which any of us could notice today if we      looked hard enough. They are:    </p>    <p>      1. Every organism produces more seeds or offspring than      will actually survive to adulthood.    </p>    <p>      2. There is variation among these seeds or offspring,    </p>    <p>      3. Traits are passed down from one generation to the next.    </p>    <p>      4. In each generation the survivors succeed-that is,      they survive-because they possess some advantage over      the ones that don't succeed. Because they survive they will      pass that advantage on to the next generation. Over time      therefore, the incidence of that trait will increase in the      population.    </p>    <p>      Bingo: The greatest, simplest, most elegant logical      construct ever to dawn across our curiosity about the      workings of natural life. It is inarguable, and it explains      everything.    </p>    <p>      Most people have no idea that this, in total, is Darwin's      theory, of natural selection. Furthermore parents who tell      their children not to listen to such talk because "it's      just a theory" are ignorant of what that word means. A      theory, in science, is a coherent set of principles used to      explain and predict a class of phenomena. Thus,      gravitational theory explains why objects fall when you      drop them, even though it, too, is "just a theory."      Darwin's has proven to be the most robust unifying      explanation ever devised in biological science. It's      stunning that he could have been so right-scientists      of Darwin's time knew absolutely nothing about genetics.      After a century and a half, during which time knowledge      expanded boundlessly in genetics, geology, paleontology and      all areas of natural science, his simple, logical construct      continues to explain and predict perfectly the existence      and behavior of every Earthly life-form we have ever      studied. As the unifying principle of natural sciences, it      is no more doubted among modern biologists than gravity is      questioned by physicists.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, in a bizarre recent trend, a number of states      have limited or even outright banned the teaching of      evolution in high schools, and many science textbooks, in      turn, have wimped out on the Subject. As a consequence, an      entire generation of students is arriving in college      unprepared to comprehend or pursue informed science. Many      science teachers I know are nostalgic for at least one      aspect of the Cold War days, when Sputnik riveted us to the      serious business of training our kids to real science,      instead of allowing it to he diluted or tossed out to      assuage the insecurities of certain ideologues.    </p>    <p>      We dilute and toss at our peril. Scientific illiteracy in      our population is leaving too many of us unprepared to      discuss or understand much of the damage we are wreaking      upon our atmosphere, our habitat and even the food that      enters our mouths. Friends who opted in school for English      lit instead of microbiology (an option I Myself could      easily have taken) sometimes come to me and ask, "In 200      words or less, can You explain to me why I should be      nervous about genetic engineering?" I tell them, "Sit down,      I'll make you a cup of tea, and then get ready for more      than 200 words."    </p>    <p>      A sound-bite culture can't discuss science very well.      Exactly what we're losing when we reduce biodiversity, the      causes and consequences of global-warming these      traumas can't be adequately, summarized in an evening news      wrap-up. Arguments in favor of genetically engineered food,      in contrast, are dangerously simple: A magazine ad for an      agribusiness touts its benevolent plan to "feed the world's      hungry with our vitamin-engineered rice!"    </p>    <p>      To which I could add in reply my own snappy motto: "if you      thought that first free hit of heroin was a good idea ... "      But before you really can decide whether or not you agree,      you may need the words above and a few thousand more. If      so, then sit down. I have a cup of tea, and bear with me.      This is important.    </p>    <p>      At the root of everything. Darwin said, is that wonder of      wonders, genetic diversity. You're unlike your sister, I      litter of pups is its own small Rainbow Coalition, and      every grain of wheat in a field holds inside its germ a      slightly separate destiny. You can't see die differences      until you cast the seeds on the ground and grow them out,      but sure enough, some will grow into taller plants and some      shorter, some tougher. Some sweeter. In a good year all or      most of them will thrive and give you wheat. But in a had      year a spate of high winds may take down the tallest stalks      and leave standing at harvest time only. Say, the 10      percent of the crop that had a "shortness" gene. And if      that wheat comprises your winter's supply of bread plustile      only seed you'll have lot, next year's crop, then you'll be      almighty glad to have that small, short harvest.    </p>    <p>      Genetic diversity, in domestic populations as well as wild      ones, is nature's sole insurance policy. Environments      change: Wet years, are followed by droughts, fakes dry up,      volcanoes rumble ice ages dawn. It's a big bad world out      there for a little strand of DNA. But a population will      persist over time if, deep within the scattered genetics of      its ranks, it is literally prepared for anything. When the      windy years persist for a decade, the wheat population will      be overtaken by a preponderance of shortness, but if the      crop maintains its diversify, there will always be      recessive aspirations for height hiding in there somewhere      waiting to have their day.    </p>    <p>      How is the diversity maintained? That old black magic      called sex. Every seed has two parents. Plants throw their      sex to the wind to a hummingbird's tongue to the knees of a      bee-in April you are inhaling sex, and sneezing. In      the process, each two parents put their scrambled genes      into offspring that represent whole new genetic      combinations never before seen on Earth. Every new outfit      will be ready for something, and together-in a      large-enough population-the whole crowd will be ready      for anything. Individuals will die, not at random but      because of some fatal misfit between what an organism has      and what's required. But the population will live on,      moving always in the direction of fitness      (however-fitness" is at the moment defined), not      because anyone has a master plan but because survival      carries fitness forward and death doesn't.    </p>    <p>      People have railed at this reality, left and tight, since      the evening when a British ambassador's wife declared to      her husband, "Oh dear, let us hope Mr. Darwin isn't right,      and if he is, let us hope no one finds out about it!"      Fundamentalist Christians seem disturbed by a scenario in      which individual will is so irrelevant. They might be      surprised to learn that Stalin tried to ban the study of      genetics and evolution in Soviet universities for the      opposite reason, attacking the idea of natural      selection-which acts only at the level of the      individual-for being anti-Communist. Through it all,      the little engines of evolution have kept on turning as      they have done for millennia, delivering us here and      passing on, untouched by politics or what anybody thinks,    </p>    <p>      Nikolai Vavilov was an astounding man of science, and      probably the greatest plant explorer who has ever lived. In      his travels through 64 countries between 1916 and 1940, he      recorded more crop diversity than anyone had known existed,      and founded the world's largest seed collection.    </p>        <p>      As he combed continents looking for primitive crop      varieties, Vavilov noticed a pattern: Genetic variation was      not evenly distributed. In a small region of Ethiopia lie      found hundreds of ancient wheat varieties known only to      that place. A single New World plateau was astonishingly      rich in corn varieties, while another one was rolling in      different kinds of potatoes. Vavilov mapped the      distribution of his findings and theorized that the degree      of a crop's diversity indicated how long it had been grown      in a given region, as farmers saved a their seeds through      hundreds and thousands of seasons. They also saved more      types of seed for different benefits. Popcorn, tortilla      corn and roasting corn were derived, over centuries, from      one original strain. Within each crop type, the generations      of selection also yield a breadth of resistance to all      types of pest and weather problems encountered through the      years.    </p>    <p>      By looking through his lens of genetics, Vavilov began to      pinpoint the places in the world where human agriculture      had originated. Modern genetic research has largely borne      out his hypothesis that agriculture emerged independently      in the places where the most diverse and ancient crop      types, known as land races, are found: in the Near East,      northern China, Mesoamerica and Ethiopia.    </p>    <p>      The industrialized world depends entirely on crops and      cultivation practices imported from what we now call the      Third World (though evidently it actually was first). In an      important departure from older traditions, the crops we now      grow in the United States are extremely uniform      genetically, due to the fact our agriculture is controlled      primarily by a few large agricultural corporations that      sell relatively few varieties of seeds. Those who know the      seed business are well aware that our shallow gene bank is      highly vulnerable: When a crop strain succumbs all across      the country, all at once to a new disease (as happened with      U.S. corn in 1970), researchers must return to the more      diverse original strains for help, So we still rely on the      gigantic insurance policy provided by the genetic      variability in the land races, which continue to be      hand-sown and harvested, year in and year out, by farmers      in those mostly poor places from which our crops arose.    </p>    <p>      Unbelievably, we are now engaged in a serious effort to      cancel that insurance policy.    </p>    <p>      It happens like this. Let's say you are an Ethiopian farmer      growing a land race of wheat-a wildly variable, husky      mongrel crop that has been in your family for hundreds of      years. You always lose some to wind and weather, but the      rest still comes through every year. Lately, though, you've      been hearing about a kind of Magic Wheat that grows six      times bigger than your crop, is easier to harvest and      contains vitamins not found in ordinary wheat. And      amazingly enough, by special arrangement with the      government, it's free.    </p>    <p>      Readers who have even the slightest acquaintance with fairy      tales will already know there is trouble ahead in this      story, The Magic Wheat grows well the first year, but its      rapid, overly green growth attracts a startling number of      pests. You see insects on this crop that never have eaten      wheat before, in the whole of your family's history. You      watch, you worry. You realize that you're going to have to      spray a pesticide to get this crop through to harvest.      You're not so surprised to learn that by special      arrangement with the government, the same company that gave      you the free seed can sell the pesticide you need. It's a      good M. ficide, they use it all the time in America, but it      costs money you don't have, so you'll have to borrow      against next year's crop.    </p>    <p>      The second year, you will be visited by a terrible drought      and your crop will not survive to harvest at all. Every      stalk dies. Magic Wheat from America doesn't know beans      about Ethiopian drought. The end,    </p>    <p>      Actually, if the drought arrived in Year Two and the end      came that quickly, you'd be very lucky, because chances are      good you'd still have some of your family-line seed around.      It would be much more disastrous if the drought waited      until the eighth or ninth year to wipe you out, for then      you'd have no wheat left at all, Magic or otherwise. Seed      banks, even if they're 11,000 years old, can't survive for      more than a few years on the shelf if they aren't grown out      as crops year after year. they die-or else get ground      into flour and baked and eaten-and then this product      of a thousand hands and careful selection is just gone,      once and for all.    </p>    <p>      This is no joke. The infamous potato famine or Southern      Corn leaf Blight catastrophe could happen again any day      now, in any place where people are once again foolish or      poor enough to be coerced (as was the case in Ireland) to      plant an entire country in a single genetic swain of a food      crop.    </p>    <p>      While agricultural companies have purchased, stored and      patented certain genetic materials from old crops, they      cannot engineer a crop, ever, that will have the resilience      of land races under a wide variety of environmental      conditions. Genetic engineering is the antithesis of      variability because it removes the wild card-that      beautiful thing called sex-from the equation.<br />    </p>        <p>      This is our new magic bullet: We can move single genes      around in a genome to tender a specific trait that nature      can't put there, Such as ultrarapid growth or vitamin A in      rice. Literally, we could put a wolf in sheep's clothing.      But solving agricultural problems this way turns out to be      far less broadly effective than the old-fashioned      multigenic solutions derived through programs of selection      and breeding. Crop predators evolve in quick and mysterious      ways, while gene splicing tries one simple tack after      another, approaching its goal the way Wile E. Coyote tries      out each new gizmo from Acme only once, only to be      outwitted by Roadrunner. Crestfallen, Wile E. goes back to      the drawing board.    </p>    <p>      Wendell Berry, with his reliable wit, wrote that genetic      manipulation in general and cloning in particular: " ...      besides being a new method of sheep-stealing, is only a      pathetic attempt to make sheep predictable. But this is an      affront to reality. As any shepherd would know, the      scientist who thinks he has made sheep predictable has only      made himself eligible to be outsmarted."    </p>    <p>      I've heard less knowledgeable people comfort themselves on      the issue of genetic engineering by recalling that humans      have been pushing genes around for centuries, through      selective breeding of livestock and crops. I even read one      howler of a quote that began, "Ever since Mendel spliced      those first genes... " These people aren't getting it, but      I don't blame them-I blame the religious fanatics who      kept basic biology out of their grade-school textbooks.      Mendel did not splice genes; he didn't actually control      anything at all. He simply watched peas to learn how their      natural system of genetic recombination worked.    </p>    <p>      The farmers who select their best sheep or grains to mother      the following year's crop are working with the evolutionary      force of selection, pushing it in the direction of their      choosing. Anything produced this will still work within its      natural evolutionary context of variability, predators',      disease resistance and so forth. But tampering with genes      outside the checks and balances you might call the rules of      God's laboratory is an entirely different process. It's      turning out to have unforeseen, sometimes stunning,      consequences.    </p>    <p>      To choose one example among many, genetic engineers have      spliced a bacterium into a corn plant. It was arguably a      good idea. The bacterium is Bacillus thuringensis (Bt) a      germ that causes caterpillars' stomachs to disintegrate. It      doesn't harm humans, birds, or even ladybugs or bees, so      it's one of the most useful pesticides we've ever      discovered.    </p>    <p>      Organic farmers ha% e worked for years to expedite the path      of the naturally Occurring lit spores from the soil, where      the bacterium lives, Onto their plants. YOU Can buy this      germ in a can at the nursery and shake it onto your tomato      plants, where it makes caterpillars croak before sliding      hack into the soil it came from farmers have always used      nature to their own ends, employing relatively slow methods      circumscribed within tile context of natural laws. But      genetic engineering took a giant step and spliced pail of      the bacteriums DNA into a corn plants DNA chain so as tile      corn grew, each of its cells would contain the bacterial      function of caterpillar-killing. When each grain produced      pollen, it would have a secret weapon against tile corn      worms that like to crawl down silks to ravage the crop. So      far, so good.    </p>    <p>      But when Bt corn sheds its pollen and casts it to the wind,      as corn has always done (it's pollinated by wind not by      bees), it dusts a fine layer of fit pollen onto every tree      and bush in the neighborhood of every farm that grows it      which is rapidly, for this popular crop, becoming the      territory known as the United States. There the Bt pollen      may infect any butterfly larva in its path. Populations of      monarch butterflies those hold little pilgrims who migrate      all the way to Mexico and back by their tissuethin wings,      are plummeting fast. While there are many reasons for this      (for example, their winter inter forests in Mexico are      bering burned), no reasonable person can argue that dusting      them with a lethal bacterium is going to help matters, So,      too will be the fate of other butterflies more obscure, and      more endangered.    </p>    <p>      And if that doesn't happen to break your heart, just wait      awhile, because some filling that pollinates your food or      builds tile soil also may be destined for extinction. And      there's another practical problem: The massive exposure to      Bt now contained in every cell of this corn, is killing off      all crop predators except those few that have mutated a      resistance to this long-useful pesticide. As a result,      those super-resistant mutants are taking over in exactly      the same way that overexposure to antibiotics is      facilitating the evolution of antibioticresistant diseases      in humans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Would you trust a guy in a suit who's never given away a      nickel in his life, who now tells you he's made you some      free Magic Wheat?</strong>    </p>    <p>      In this context of phenomenal environmental upsets. with      even larger ones just Offstage awaiting their cue, it's a      bit surprising that the objections to genetic engineering      we hear most about are the human health effects. It is      absolutely true that new DNA combinations can create      proteins we aren't prepared to swallow; notably, genetic      manipulations in corn unexpectedly created antigens to      which some humans are allergic, The potential human ills      caused by ingestion of engineered foods remain an open      category-which is scary enough in itself, and I don't      mean to minimize it. But there are so many ways for genetic      manipulation to destroy our habitat and Our food systems      that the environmental challenges loom as something on the      order of a cancer that might well make personal allergies      look like a sneeze.    </p>    <p>      If genetically reordered organisms infiltrate natural      populations, they may rapidly change the genetics in a way      that could seal the entire species' doom. A scenario      dangerously omnipresent is pollen escaping from genetically      manipulated crops, creating new weeds that we cannot hope      to remove from the face of the earth. Engineered genes      don't play by the rules that have organized life for 3      billion years (or, if you prefer, 4,004). And in this case,      winning means loser takes all.    </p>    <p>      What will it mean for a handful of agribusinesses to      control the world's ever-narrowing seed hanks? What about      the chemical dependencies they're creating for farmers in      developing countries where government deals with      multinational corporations are including farmers to grow      these engineered crops? What about the business of      patenting and owning genes? Can there be any good in this      for the flat-out need of people trying to feed themselves?      Does it seem safe, the world now being what it is, to give      up self-sustaining food systems in favor of dependency on      the global marketplace? And finally, would you trust a guy      in a suit who's never given away a nickel in his life, who      now tells you lie's made you some free Magic Wheat?    </p>    <p>      These are not questions to take lightly as we stand here in      the epicenter of corporate agribusiness and look around at      the world, asking,-Why on earth would they hate us?"      The general ignorance of U.S. populations about who      controls global agriculture reflects our trust in an      assured food supply. Elsewhere, in places where people grow      more food, watch less TV and generally encounter a greater      risk of hunger than we do, they mostly know what's going      on. In India, farmers, persist in burning to the ground      trial crops of transgenic cotton, and they forced their      government to ban Monsanto's "Terminator technology," which      causes plants to kill their own embryos so no viable seeds      will survive for a farmer to replant in the next generation      (meaning he'd have to buy new ones, of course). Much of the      world has already refused to import genetically engineered      foods or seeds from the United States. But because of the      power and momentum of the World Trade Organization, fewer      and fewer countries have the clout to resist reconstruction      of their food supply around the scariest New Deal ever.    </p>    <p>      Even standing apart from the moral and political      questions-if a scientist can stand anywhere without      stepping on the politics of what's about to he      discovered-there are consequences in the science of      the matter no one knew how to anticipate. When the widely      publicized Human Genome Project completed its mapping of      human chromosomes, it offered an unsettling, not-so-widely      publicized conclusion: Instead of the 100,000 or more genes      that had been expected, based on the number of proteins we      must synthesize to be what we are, we have only about      30,000-roughly the same number as a mustard plant.    </p>    <p>      This evidence undermined the central dogma of how genes      work; that is, the assumption of a clear-cut chain of      processes leading from a single gene to the appearance of      the trait it controls. Instead, the mechanism of gene      expression appears vastly more complicated than had been      assumed since Watson and Crick discovered the structure of      DNA in 1953. The expression of a gene may be altered by its      context, such as the presence of other genes on the      chromosome near it. Yet, genetic engineering operates on      assumptions based on the simpler model. Thus, single      transplanted genes often behave in starling ways in an      engineered organism, often proving lethal to themselves,      or, Sometimes, neighboring organisms. In light of newer      findings, geneticists increasingly concede that      gene-tinkering is to some extent shooting in the dark Barry      Commoner, senior scientist at the Center for the Biology of      Natural Systems at Queens College, laments that while the      public's concerns are often derided by industry scientists      as irrational and uneducated, the biotechnology industry is      conveniently ignoring the latest results in the field      "which show that there are strong reasons to fear the      potential consequences of transferring a DNA gene between      species."    </p>    <p>      Recently I heard Joan Dye Gussow, who studies and writes      about the energetics, economics and irrationalities of      global food production, discussing some of these problems.      She mentioned the alarming fact that pollen from      genetically engineered corn is so rapidly contaminating all      other corn that we may soon have no naturally bred corn      left in the United States. "This is a fist in the eye of      God," she said, adding with a sad little laugh, "and I'm      not even all that religious." Whatever you believe      in-whether God for you is the watchmaker who put      together the intricate workings of this world in seven days      or seven hundred billion days-you'd be wise to      believe the part about the fist.    </p>    <p>      Religion has no place in the science classroom, where it      may abridge students' opportunities to learn the methods,      discoveries and explanatory hypotheses of science rather      its place is in the hearts of the women and men who study      and then practice scientific exploration. Ethics can't      influence the outcome of an experiment, but they can serve      as a useful adjunct to the questions that get asked in the      first place, and to the applications thereafter. (One must      wonder what chair God occupied, if any, in the Manhattan      Project.) In the halls of science there is often an      unspoken sense that morals and objectivity can't occupy the      same place. That is balderdash-they always have      cohabited.    </p>    <p>      Social norms and judgments regarding gender, race, the      common good, cooperation, competition, material gain and      countless other issues reside in every active human mind,      so they were hovering somewhere in the vicinity of any      experiment ever conducted by a human. That is precisely why      science invented the double-blind experiment, in which, for      example, experimental subjects don't know whether they're      taking the drug or the placebo and neither does the      scientist recording their responses, so as to avoid      psychological bias in the results. But it's not possible to      double-blind the scientist's approach to the task in the      first place, or to the way results will be used. It is      probably more scientifically constructive to acknowledge      our larger agenda than to pretend it doesn't exist. Where      genetic engineering is concerned, I would rather have      ethics than profitability driving the program.    </p>    <p>      I was trained as a biologist, and I can appreciate the      challenge and the technical mastery involved in isolating,      understanding and manipulating genes. I can think of      fascinating things I'd like to do as a genetic engineer,      But I only have to stand still for a minute and watch the      outcome of 30 million years' worth of hummingbird evolution      transubstantiated before my eyes into nest and egg to get      knocked down to size. I have held in my hand the germ of a      plant engineered to grow, yield its crop and then murder      its own embryos, and there I glimpsed the malevolence that      can lie in the heart of a profiteering enterprise. There      once was a time when Thoreau wrote, "I have great faith in      a seed. Convince me that you have a seed there, and I am      prepared to expect wonders." By the power vested in      everything living, let us keep to that faith. I'm a      scientist who thinks it wise to enter the doors of creation      not with a lion trainer's whip arid chair, but with the      reverence humankind has traditionally summoned for entering      places of worship: a temple, a mosque or a cathedral. A      sacred grove, as ancient as time.    </p>    <p>      From the book <em>Small</em> <em>Wonder</em> by Barbara      Kingsolver, published by HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.
