                      <h5 id="byline">Edited by Brook Elliott    </h5>        <p>Great taste is one of the biggest reasons to grow your own      garden, yet many of the best-tasting varieties are becoming      hard to find. That's because our current food system often      values shelf life and shipping qualities more than taste      and tenderness. MOTHER'S Cream of the Crop series presents      outstanding varieties recommended by our green-thumbed      readers.    </p>    <h3>      'JAUNE FLAMME' ORANGE TOMATO    </h3>    <p>      An old French variety, 'Jaune Flamme' is a fabulous      fresh-eating tomato with an explosive, intense flavor that      shines through any salad dressing with ease.    </p>    <p>      The outer walls are thick and meaty, with just enough juice      to provide a full-bodied, citrus-like flavor that surprises      all who try it for the first time. The real joy is cutting      into one. The yellow-orange skin yields to beautiful      red-mottled flesh inside.    </p>    <p>      Although this heirloom is excellent for fresh salads, it      reaches its full potential as a drying tomato. It has such      an exquisite flavor that I use it exclusively when baking,      especially in breads.    </p>    <p>      A joy to grow as well as to eat, the plants are      indeterminate (bearing fruit continuously) and early      producers, and seem resistant to many diseases that      normally plague tomatoes. The fruits are held in clusters      of six to eight, each fruit the size of a golf ball or      slightly larger.    </p>    <p>      Seed is available from the Seed Savers Exchange catalog and      Tomato Growers Supply (listed as 'Flamme').    </p>    <p>      <strong>MELODY ROSE<br />      Benton, Kentucky</strong>    </p>    <h3>      'TOBACCO WORM' SNAP BEANS    </h3>        <p>      Tobacco Worm' is the standard by which I judge all other      snap beans. A pole variety, it has pods that grow thick as      your finger and 6 or more inches long, yet never turn woody      or fibrous. Even when filled out with their average of six      seeds, they remain tender-crisp as long as they are green.      'Tobacco Worm' has a rich, deep flavor without the high      sugar content that makes many other snap beans seem overly      sweet to me. Like most old-time varieties, 'Tobacco Worm'      has zipper strings that are easily removed when you snap      off the tips before cooking.    </p>    <p>      'Tobacco Worm' beans hail from eastern Kentucky, where they      were thought to resemble the notorious tobacco worm. They      have been in some families for as many as six generations,      but it took me three years of searching to finally find      seed. My line comes from Virginia Jones of Waco, Kentucky,      whose family has grown the beans since the 1960s. Their      seed came from the Farris Rose family of Estill County,      Kentucky. Mr. Rose, who died at age 91 in 1988, had      inherited them from his parents, who presumably inherited      them from their parents.    </p>    <p>      There are no commercial sources of 'Tobacco Worm' bean      seed. However, by special arrangement, MOTHER EARTH Nevis      readers can order packets of 100 seeds for $5, postpaid,      from Bill Best; Sustainable Mountain Agriculture Center;      1033 Pilot Knob Cemetery Road; Berea, KY 40403.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BROOK ELLIOTT<br />      Richmond, Kentucky</strong>    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Green Beans with Aioli Verde    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 pound 'Tobacco Worm' or other green beans, tipped and      tailed, with strings removed</em> <em>1/2 cup cilantro or      parsley leaves, packed</em> <em>6 to 8 large garlic cloves,      crushed</em> <em>7 cup mayonnaise</em>    </p>    <p>      In a blender, puree cilantro leaves with just enough water      to produce a paste. Combine cilantro, garlic and      mayonnaise. Chill in refrigerator for at least one hour to      let flavors blend.    </p>    <p>      Gently steam beans until tender. Spoon aioli dressing over      each serving.    </p></div>    <h3>      'LAXTON PROGRESS NO. 9' GARDEN PEA    </h3>    <p>      At first bite, the sugars of this sweet, silky-smooth pea      spring to the surface, but balanced with just a hint of      starch, they also are savory enough to dress up a salad or      to eat fresh.    </p>    <p>      'Laxton Progress No. 9' is named in honor of Thomas Laxton,      a famous 19th century plant breeder. The 18-inch-tall, very      productive plants produce 4 1/2-inch pods that mature in 75      days. Seed is available from Victory. Willhite, Shumway and      William Dam companies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DAVID GEIER<br />      El Cajon, California</strong>    </p>    <h3>      'LUTZ GREENLEAF' BEET    </h3>    <p>      Unlike some other beet varieties, 'Lutz Greenleaf' is      deliciously sweet but not overwhelming. The mild taste of      these tender giants temps one to eat slice after slice.      Just cook them and eat them warm, with nothing else added.      The tops also are edible, simply steamed like Swiss chard      or added to a green salad.    </p>    <p>      The reddish-purple, top-shaped roots are one of the best      beets for winter storage. Sown in the spring for fall      harvest, they also overwinter well when mulched heavily.    </p>    <p>      Said to have originated in Germany, 'Lutz Greenleaf' is an      Amish and Mennonite heirloom, common in Pennsylvania Dutch      country. 'Winterkeeper' and 'Lutz Greenleaf' are the same      variety, and 'Longseason' may also be synonymous with them.    </p>    <p>      Seed is available from Nichols, Territorial, Abundant Life      and William Dam seed companies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>JEPTHA YODER<br />      Milroy, Pennsylvania</strong>    </p><hr />    <p>      <em>For seed company addresses, see " Gardeners Almanac "      on Pages 90 and</em> 91.    </p>    <h3>      Nominations Wanted    </h3>    <p>      <strong>To nominate your favorite great-tasting variety,      contact Brook Elliott at Box 519; Richmond, KY 40476; or      BrookBarb@aol.com for details.</strong>    </p>
