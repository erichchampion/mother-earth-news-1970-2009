                    <h5 id="byline">    by Lee Reich  </h5>          <p>      Do you nip with caution when pruning a plants Or do you      ruthlessly attack? No matter what approach you take,      sometimes you just have to prune your plants. Here are the      most basic pruning principles to follow for fruit-producing      plants, other deciduous trees and shrubs, and evergreens.    </p>    <h3>      Removing a Large Branch    </h3>                        <p>      Use sharp tools no matter what type of plant you're      pruning. Sharp tools make cleaner cuts that heal more      quickly. Make cuts on an angle and just above a node, where      the leaf attaches to the stem.    </p>    <p>      If you want to encourage branching, use heading cuts to      shorten existing stems. If you want to open an area to      light and air, use thinning cuts to completely remove some      stems.    </p>    <p>      On any plant, if you find stems or branches that are dead,      diseased or damaged, always cut them down to healthy      tissue. That said, let's move on to pruning guidelines for      various categories of plants.    </p>        <h3>      PRUNING FRUIT PLANTS    </h3>    <p>      Pruning is most critical for fruit plants. Young fruit      trees need a strong framework on which to hang their fruits      and to ensure their branches bask in plenty of      sugar-producing sunlight. Pruning fruit plants lessens      disease problems and, by removing some fruits, pumps more      flavor and size into those that remain. With few      exceptions, prune fruit plants while they are dormant.    </p>    <p>      With a young fruit tree, preserve branches that are 6      inches apart and that make wide angles with the trunk. If      the tree is initially a single stem, at planting, cut back      that stem to 2 to 3 feet above ground level, then select      side branches as the plant grows.    </p>    <p>      If the tree already has branches, save those that are      wide-angled and in good positions, but remove all others.      Shorten those you save to a few inches.    </p>    <p>      Do no more pruning on a young tree than is absolutely      needed or you will delay fruiting.    </p>    <p>      Mature fruit trees need annual pruning. The amount to      remove depends on the size of the particular fruit and the      bearing habit of the tree. Cherries, for instance, are      small and are borne on older stems, so the plants need      little pruning. Peaches, in contrast, are large and are      borne only on 1-year-old wood, so they need severe annual      pruning to thin fruits and stimulate new shoots that can      bear the following year's crop.    </p>    <p>      Prune raspberries and other fruit bushes little or not at      all when they are young, then annually remove the oldest      wood and thin out the youngest wood. The younger the wood      on which most fruits are borne and the more new shoots that      grow each year from ground level, the more severe the      annual pruning will need to be.    </p>    <p>      At planting, cut grapes and other vines back to a few buds      to channel energy into growing a single stem (sometimes      two). From then on, training depends on the type of fruit      and the kind of trellis or arbor you provide.    </p>    <p>      New fruiting stems arise where old stems are cut back to      within a few buds of permanent branches or the trunk.    </p>    <h3>      DECIDUOUS BUSHES    </h3>    <p>      Most deciduous shrubs look best growing as a fountain of      stems. Because they naturally send up new stems from ground      level each year, they can be pruned so that old, decrepit      stems are in a continual state of replacement by young,      vigorous ones. Do not prune at all when the plants are      young. Despite all that is said and written about roses,      they are just another deciduous shrub and can he pruned as      such with fine results.    </p>    <p>      Prune with hand shears or a Topper, not hedge shears. Use a      Topper to cut some of the oldest suckers to the ground or      down to low. vigorous replacement shoots. How much to cut      varies from shrub to shrub. The more new suckers a plant      makes each year, the more suckers you have to remove.      Forsythia and red-twig dogwood both need more pruning than      witch hazel or smokebush.    </p>    <p>      Shorten lanky stems that arch all the way to the ground and      remove any overcrowded stems in the center of the shrub.    </p>    <p>      Prune shrubs that flower early in the season right after      their blossoms fade. Prune shrubs that flower from summer      onwards just before spring growth begins.    </p>    <h3>      DECIDUOUS HEDGES    </h3>    <p>      A few deciduous bushes make nice hedges, although many look      best grown informally rather than sheared. In either case,      their lack of leaves in winter is offset by their dense      twigs. Cut back plants drastically when you plant, to      promote low branching and vigorous growth. For formal      hedges, shorten main and secondary stems just before the      plants begin their second season of growth.    </p>    <p>      Shape formal hedges so that planes are narrower at their      tops than at their bottoms.    </p>    <p>      This allows light to bathe all parts of the hedge so the      hedge doesn't thin out at its ankles. Shear mature, formal      hedges after their spring flush of growth, almost back to      where growth began for that season. Prune informal hedges      the same as individual shrubs: Each year, remove some older      stems at the plants' bases, thin out excess young stems and      shorten stems that are too long.    </p>            <h3>      DECIDUOUS TREES    </h3>    <p>      Trees do eventually assert their individual character as      they age, but early training can be important for long-term      strength and beauty. Except for small trees that develop      multiple trunks, allow only one vertical shoot to become      the trunk, then the central leader (the main vertical      branch) running up through the tree. Bend down, cut back,      or cut off any competitors. Also use this strategy for      coniferous and broadleaf evergreen trees.    </p>    <p>      For scaffold branches - the future side limbs -      select stems that are thinner than the central leader and      spaced 1 to 2 feet apart. The height of the lowest scaffold      limb depends on how high a head you want. Scaffold limbs      will grow thicker, but their aboveground height never      changes.    </p>    <p>      Allow weak temporary branches to remain along the      developing trunk and central leader to help thicken and      protect the branches from sunburn. Remove these temporary      branches after a couple of years.    </p>    <p>      Prune the developing tree as little as possible. You want      growth, and any pruning stunts growth to some degree.    </p>    <p>      Use thinning cuts to reduce or maintain size and let light      and air into the crown of a mature or overgrown tree.    </p>    <p>      Gradual Renovation of a Neglected Shrub    </p>    <p>      <strong>FIRST YEAR<br />      Thin the youngest stems and cut away some of the oldest      stems.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SECOND AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS<br />      Repeat the first-year sequence.</strong>    </p>        <h3>      CONIFEROUS TREES AND BUSHES    </h3>    <p>      Generally, coniferous evergreens need little pruning when      being trained or after they mature, especially if you plant      one suited to the site. There are so many shapes and sizes      available for most kinds of conifers that it's often      possible to select a plant that will just fit its intended      space and require no pruning.    </p>    <p>      To contain growth or make a plant smaller, prune just      before growth begins, cutting stems back to side branches      within the plant. Conifers vary in their ability to regrow      from old wood, so know or test a plant's response before      any drastic pruning. To make a plant denser, shorten new      spring growth before the plant has fully expanded.    </p>    <p>      This article is adapted from Lee Reich's <em>The      Pruning</em> <em>Book.</em> See <strong>MOTHER'S</strong>      Bookshelf, Page 129, to order.    </p>    <h3>      BROADLEAF EVERGREEN TREES AND BUSHES    </h3>    <p>      Like conifers, broadleaf evergreens need little pruning      - especially if you plant one suited to the site.    </p>    <p>      As with coniferous trees, prune just before growth begins,      and cut stems back to side branches. Broadleaf evergreens      vary in their ability to send out new shoots from old stems      that are cut back. To make a plant denser, pinch the tips      of growing shoots.    </p>    <p>      Once you get the hang of pruning and are pleased with the      results, you might want to learn even more about how this      procedure can help a tree develop the healthiest structure      possible. You also might want to experiment with some      specialized design techniques, such as using pruning to      create a pleached tunnel of ironwood trees or a living      fence of espalier currants.    </p>
