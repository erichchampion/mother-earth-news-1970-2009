                             <p>      There are lots of grasshoppers around here, but my hens patrol the garden      perimeter fence and really reduce the numbers of insects in      the garden. Before I got the hens, some crops were totally      destroyed by the 'hoppers. The hens also have helped      control <strong>scorpions</strong> - they peck off      the stinger and then work on the rest.    </p>    <p>      The chickens also have reduced the <strong>fire      ant</strong> population by eating the bugs and seeds the      ants would have sustained themselves on. I have no ticks      here, but the chickens have reduced one nasty pest that had      been around everywhere - <strong>termites.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>M. WADE<br />      New Braunfels, Texas</strong>    </p><hr />        <p>      We have a 40-acre horse farm. Unfortunately, where there      are horse barns there also are <strong>rats and mice.</strong> The horses leave bits of      grain on the ground after they eat, and some undigested      grain shows up in their manure. With all of this food, we      had a serious rat and mouse problem.    </p>		    <p>      My grandfather set out rat poison, and a trip to the      veterinarian and $500 later, I found out that my Jack      Russell terrier really likes the taste of it. She is fine,      but I refuse to allow any more poison on our farm.    </p>    <p>      Instead, we got chickens. The birds accompany the horses      and clean up all the grains on the ground and in the      horses' manure. Their careful gleaning eliminates the      source of food for the mice and rats, and now the pests      have all but disappeared.    </p>    <p>      The benefit I had not counted on when I added chickens to      our farm is that now we no longer have a      <strong>flea</strong> problem. The chickens also help      control <strong>files</strong> and <strong>lawn      grubs.</strong> I love having the chickens. Not only do      they control unwanted pests, but they are fun to watch,      too. We have experimented with several different breeds,      but our favorites are Silkies and Barred Rocks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TINA DURBOROW<br />      Lewisville, Pennsylvania</strong>    </p>    <p>      When we came to Cross Plains during a long drought, we      found that our windmill supplied plenty of water for a      garden, so we planted one. Next we knew, thousands of      <strong>grasshoppers</strong> came from every direction and      left us with bare stalks.    </p>    <p>      To beat the 'hoppers, we built a chicken and turkey run      that surrounds our garden. The fencing is 5 feet high and      has occasional cross fencing to keep hawks from swooping in      and snatching up one of the chickens. Any grasshoppers that      approach the garden have to move into this "moat," where      the chickens and turkeys quickly gobble them up.    </p>    <p>      We also let guineas loose in the garden (they don't tend to      scratch as much or peck the vegetables the way chickens and      turkeys do). So far, this one-two punch is working well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CURT AND GINNY HOSKINS<br />      Cross Plains, Texas</strong>    </p>    		<div class="sidebar">    <p>      Solved Your Pest Peeves?    </p>    <p>      If you have tales of pest control by chickens, ducks, geese      or guineas, please send them to:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Poultry Pest Control<br /></strong> <strong>MOTHER      EARTH NEWS<br /></strong> <strong>1503 SW 42nd St.<br />      Topeka, KS 66609</strong>    </p>    <p>      or e-mail letters@motherearthnews.com    </p></div>    <p>      An outbreak of <strong>pillbugs</strong> (rolypoly bugs)      was eating us alive! Eating up all our tender little      lettuce plants, that is. The big greenhouse was filthy with      them. So was the hoophouse. Even the new midsized      greenhouse was infested with these little wriggling      crustaceans.    </p>    <p>      They were everywhere. Big ones. Little ones. And lots of      in-between ones. We had to do something before they ate us      out of greenhouse and home. But what? We searched all our      books and files for nontoxic controls, to no avail. Old boo      ks said to use DDT, lindane or chlordane, all toxic      pesticides now banned in the United States. New books said      pillbugs usually feed mostly on dead organic matter, but      that wasn't true in our greenhouses.    </p>    <p>      Finally I remembered a book about using portable coops to      let chickens feast in garden beds. Before we replanted the      lettuce beds, we penned a half-dozen hens in a bed. The      minute they spotted the first pillbug, garden soil flew,      hens' feet became yellow blurs, and the chickens' heads      bobbed up and down like runaway sewing machines.    </p>    <p>      After about an hour, things calmed down and the chickens      were napping on the freshly fluffed soil. There wasn't a      pillbug to be found.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GEORGE DEVAULT<br />      Emmaus, Pennsylvania</strong>    </p>
