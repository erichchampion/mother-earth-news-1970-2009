                <p>      Biodynamic/French intensive agriculture:<br />      A report by Ecology Action of the Midpeninsula    </p>        <p>      <strong>The world's population is off and running and      crying, "Feed me if you can!"</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>"OK. But give us <em>more</em> ," answer the      spokesmen of agribiz. "More money and more machinery and      more fossil fuels and more chemicals." "Wait a minute,"      interject a few thoughtful souls. "There <em>isn't</em> any      more. Not for long, anyway. We're going to have to do the      job with less."</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>And that's just what John Jeavons and the folks at      Palo Alto's Ecology Action of the Midpeninsula in      California are doing.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      WHO WE ARE    </h3>        <p>      Ecology Action of the Midpeninsula is a non-profit,      tax-exempt, California-based organization that was formed      in the early 70's to promote and carry on environmental      research and education. In 1972, we began experimenting      with biodynamic/French intensive food production techniques      on a 3-3/4-acre community garden called "Common Ground".    </p>    <p>      Our findings thus far indicate that the method may soon      make it possible to grow an entirely balanced human diet on      1/4 to 1/20 of the area presently required by conventional      means . . . and that such yields can be accomplished using      as little as 1/2 to 1/16 the nitrogen fertilizer, 1/2 to      1/16 the water, and 1/100 the energy expended today by      mechanized agriculture.    </p>    <p>      Considering the current state of the world (overpopulation,      widespread malnutrition, diminishing availability of land,      dwindling fossil fuel supplies, and all the rest) we feel      that such findings are vitally important. We also suspect      that many of MOTHER's readers will be interested in sharing      our discoveries. Who knows? Maybe some of you will even      want to start similar experiments of your own!    </p>    <h3>      THE BASICS    </h3>        <p>      The biodynamic/French intensive method is really a      synthesis of a number of techniques developed by European      schools of agriculture during the past century. It was all      brought together into one system by Alan Chadwick, an      inspired English horticulturist who now lives in Covelo,      California. Mastery of the concept requires a good bit of      acquired skill and knowledge, but-generally      speaking-here is what's involved:    </p>    <p>      [1] DOUBLE-DUG, RAISED BEDS. Plots three to five feet wide      and of varying length are laid out, and a temporary wooden      form (see photos) is staked around each one's perimeter.      The soil is thoroughly dug up to a depth of one foot, and      then loosened an additional 12 inches manually with a      shovel. This preparation enables plant roots to penetrate      easily and deeply, and promotes a steady flow of nutrients      to their stems and leaves. Such beds retain moisture well,      erode hardly at all, and are very easy to weed (there's no      need for two-handed, heave-ho pulling here!).    </p>    <p>      [2] INTENSIVE PLANTING. Seeds or seedlings are placed so      that each is the same distance from those nearest to it,      and close enough so that-when the plants      mature-their leaves will just barely touch those of      their neighbors and form a kind of continuous green "roof".      (Two-inch spacing is about right for most vegetables.)    </p>    <p>      Some folks simply broadcast seed and then thin the      resulting shoots to the desired distance. When we plant,      however, we lay a guide-made by stretching 2"      hexagonal-pattern chicken wire over a frame-across      the bed, and center a seed through each opening in the grid      as shown in one of the accompanying photos. The technique      creates a shaded environment under the leaves (some call it      a "living mulch") that helps retain moisture, protects the      soil's valuable microscopic life, retards weed growth,      and-therefore-helps to produce higher yields.    </p>    <p>      [3] COMPANION PLANTING. Many kinds of vegetables and fruits      grow better when near other varieties (green beans and      strawberries, for instance, make a particularly      compatible-and productive-pair). Some plants      repel harmful insects, while others attract beneficial      ones. (Borage does both: It wards off tomato worms, and      produces blue flowers that attract pollinating bees.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, many species (including weeds) grow      exceptionally long roots that loosen the subsoil and bring      up previously unavailable trace minerals and nutrients. So,      the biodynamic/French intensive gardener or farmer plans      carefully, places mutually beneficial species together,      and-in so doing-encourages high-quality crops      and helps create (and maintain) healthy, vibrant soil.    </p>    <p>      [4] COMPOST. All organic gardens, of course, thrive when      treated to lavish amounts of well-decayed manure or      vegetable matter . . . but beds that have been planted      <em>intensively</em> require even more of the material to      feed their more heavily concentrated crops. Compost      improves soil texture, creates better aeration and water      retention, and supports the microorganisms that fix      atmospheric nitrogen and produce disease-preventing      antibiotics in the soil. Conventional farming tends to      destroy such life forms.    </p>    <p>      It's important to note that the above "components" of the      biodynamic/French intensive method constitute a <em>whole      system.</em> The well-prepared soil, the closely spaced      plantings, the companion planting, and the liberal use of      compost intermesh to create a complex living environment      for growing fruits and vegetables . . . but no single one      (or just two, or three) of those techniques can effectively      stand alone. (Farmers in Europe who experimented by using      only the intensive spacing factor in combination with      conventional agricultural practices have learned that      lesson well: They soon found themselves beset with      deteriorating soil, nitrate toxicity, poor-quality produce,      diminishing populations of beneficial insects, and lowered      plant resistance to disease and pests!)    </p>    <h3>      ENORMOUS YIELDS POSSIBLE    </h3>    <p>      According to our experience, a simple 24-inch-deep soil      preparation allows <em>four times</em> as many plants as      usual to be sown in a given space, because the roots have      sufficient room to develop downward. That factor alone,      combined with the growth-promoting effects of compost      treatments and companion planting, allows anyone adhering      to the techniques to <em>quadruple</em> his or her      vegetable production! Such harvests can be (and have been)      obtained even in the first year of planting.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, research performed at the University of      California at Berkeley indicates that the overall root      health level of produce grown in agricultural soil has      declined : . . and that even a 2% to 4% increase in such      health could result in a two-to four-fold increase in field      crop harvests. The method we've been experimenting with      makes such an improvement possible by texturizing,      aerating, fertilizing, and watering the soil as a matter of      standard practice.    </p>    <p>      So . . . if you combine the arithmetic spacing and root      health factors, it's easy to see that biodynamic/French      intensive techniques can, ideally, produce <em>sixteen      times</em> more food than is produced by currently accepted      farming and gardening methods here in the United States.      Other factors, of course-such as climate, soil      condition, and type of vegetable, grain or fruit, and the      degree of skill of the farmer or gardener-can (and      do) reduce that optimal figure.    </p>    <h3>      OUR YIELDS THUS FAR    </h3>    <p>      When we began experimenting with b/F intensive techniques      in 1972, our soil was in relatively poor condition (would      you believe a pH of <em>8.0?</em> ) . . . and our own      skills, of course, required considerable enrichment also.      Since that time, however, both factors have been improved      and our annual harvests-measured under reasonably      controlled test conditions-have shown a corresponding      increase. They have, in fact, varied between two and      sixteen times the national, California, or Santa Clara      County averages.    </p>    <p>      The table below will give you some idea of how we fared as      compared to the U.S. averages for each year and crop cited:    </p>		    <p>      As you can see, some harvests have actually doubled from      year to year as the soil in our test area has improved . .      . which indicates still another major advantage of the b/F      intensive method: Yields are apparently sustainable in an      environmentally balanced way.    </p>    <p>      Mechanized agriculture relies on chemical fertilizers      which-because they gradually deplete the earth's      capacity to produce-must be applied in increasingly      large doses in order to keep annual harvests from      declining. Biodynamic/French intensive techniques, on the      other hand, build the soil and thus encourage better and      better yearly production.    </p>    <p>      To date, 62 different crops-including rice, wheat,      and fruits-have been test-grown at "Common Ground"      with varying degrees of thoroughness and success judging      from our experience and that of others, it appears that the      biodynamic/ French intensive method will produce four to      six times the U.S. national per-acre average of protein      source beans, grains, and rice, 8 times the average soft      fruit and vegetable yield, and 4 to 8 times as much seed.    </p>    <p>      As staggering as those statistics may seem, they're      absolutely mind-blowing when compared to <em>world</em>      averages, which are much lower than those of the U.S. In      fact, the worldwide figure in the bean, grain, and rice      category is <em>203</em> <em>times less</em> than the yield      which can be expected with b/F techniques!    </p>    <h3>      MINIMAL RESOURCE USE    </h3>        <p>      Obviously, high crop yields alone do not a viable      agricultural system make . . . not-that is-in      today's world, where virtually every natural resource is at      a premium. So it's especially significant that      biodynamic/French intensive farming uses water, land,      fertilizer, and energy in a very miserly way.    </p>    <p>      For instance, our experiments in vegetable production      required only 1 /2 to 1 /8 as much water per pound of food      produced as that consumed by commercial agribiz . . . and      we were working with relatively out-of-shape soil! The      Community Environmental Council in Santa Barbara, which is      conducting similar tests on better ground, boasts a      water-use record of 1/10 the "normal" amount required. And      once again, the major "components" of the technique,      intermeshed as a whole system, are together responsible for      the figures.    </p>    <p>      Research has shown that soil containing 2% active organic      matter (such as the compost used in our beds) needs only      1/4 the rainfall or irrigation required by poor land . . .      that shaded areas (such as those formed by intensive      planting) decrease moisture evaporation by 13%-16% .      . . and that earth which contains large quantities of      nutrients (encouraged, in our case, by adding decayed      vegetable matter to deeply dug beds) can reduce      transpiration of water through leaves and stems by as much      as 10% to 75%.<br />    </p>    <p>      Put all those factors together and it's easy to see why      biodynamic/French intensive techniques may someday help      countries grow at least four times as much food as they do      currently, under natural rainfall conditions . . . with no      expensive irrigation required in most cases at all! Even      arid lands such as the African Sahel could conceivably      become productive!    </p>    <p>      Fertilizer, of course, is used in vast quantities these      days, and-worse yet-requires great amounts of      energy (and materials) to manufacture, distribute, and      apply to the land. The primary fuel used to make such      substances is natural gas . . . of which the U.S. has only      a nine-year reserve. And it's estimated that-by the      year 2000-20% of all the energy consumed in the world      will be needed just to produce nitrogen fertilizer!    </p>    <p>      Obviously, any reduction of the use of such materials would      be significant . . . and, in our experiments with raising      vegetables, we found that we needed only 1/2 to 1/16 as      much added nitrogen per pound of food as do commercial      farmers. And because the b/F intensive method is manual      rather than mechanized, a further reduction in energy      consumption is apparent. Such savings should be      particularly important in countries which cannot afford      today's high fuel and fertilizer costs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NEW KIND OF FARMING!</strong><br />    </p>        <p>      Consider the implications of what we've observed so far:      The biodynamic/French intensive method can produce very      high yields on little land almost anywhere in the world,      using few resources and only simple low-capital-investment      manual tools. Together, those factors have fostered a new      concept that may well change the face of agriculture on      Planet Earth: super-productive mini-farming!    </p>    <p>      Current estimates based on test results indicate that      widespread use of b/F intensive techniques could      conceivably allow 3%-6% of a population to grow all      of a country's food. A family of four, working a total of      56 hours per week (that's two hours a day for each      individual) on a little less than two acres, should be able      to raise-within a six-month growing      season-enough food (grains, vegetables, fruits, and      fodder for dairy animals) to supply a complete      2,379-calories-per-day annual diet for 32 people!    </p>    <p>      Wholesale market value (50% of retail) of such a harvest,      based on current U.S. food prices, would be around $9,600 .      . . and, if inexpensive mini-greenhouses were used to      extend the growing season year round, that output (and the      resulting cash income) could be doubled!    </p>    <p>      On a smaller scale, a family of the same size working      toward food self-sufficiency alone could use b/F intensive      techniques to raise their entire annual food needs on just      10,000 square feet of soil-less than a quarter of an      acre-by working just one or two hours a day during a      six-month season!    </p>    <p>      Such stunning efficiencies, of course, cannot be      accomplished overnight. Most soils require considerable      improvement (a gradual process that can take up to five      years), and would be mini-farmers must give themselves      enough time to develop both an intimate understanding of      the concepts involved and a familiarity with the skills      required to produce successful harvests.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, the potential value of biodynamic/French      intensive agriculture-for individuals, homesteading      families, communities, and (perhaps most important) Third      World countries now struggling desperately to feed their      citizens-clearly overrides the relatively      insignificant investment of time and effort that's      initially required.    </p>    <h3>      AND A FINAL NOTE    </h3>    <p>      Ecology Action of the Midpeninsula is now eagerly entering      its fifth year of exploration into the wonders of      biodynamic/ French intensive agriculture. We hope that many      of you, too, will recognize the importance and possible      worldwide impact of the system, and begin similar      experiments of your own. With a little patience and work,      you'll soon see for yourself what the method can produce:      high yields for you and your family . . . and even higher      hopes for Planet Earth and its people!    </p>    <h3>      PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE FROM ECOLOGY ACTION OF THE      MIDPENINSULA    </h3>    <p>      A complete, 77-page manual explaining the "nuts and bolts"      of biodynamic/French intensive techniques, entitled <em>How      To Grow More Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible On      Less Land Than You Can Imagine</em> (reviewed in MOTHER NO.      29's "Access" column), is available direct from Ecology      Action of the Midpeninsula (2225 El Camino Real, Palo Alto,      Calif. 93406).
