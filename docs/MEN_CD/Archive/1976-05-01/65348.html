                <h5 id="byline">     by C. EGGLETON    </h5>        <p>      Last spring, my wife and, I were faced with a problem that      I suppose most folks run into sooner or later: We wanted a      garden-in fact, we desperately <em>needed</em> a      garden?but we didn't have any place to put one.    </p>    <p>      At the time, I had just left the Army and was out of work,      so the idea of spending my hard-to-come-by cash on      overpriced supermarket produce wasn't all that attractive.      Unfortunately, our landlord didn't like the notion of us      digging a vegetable patch in the backyard any better . . .      and even if he had, we would've hesitated.    </p>    <p>      You see, we hoped to move to a small farm sometime before      the end of the growing season, and we didn't want to have      to leave a still thriving garden behind. Besides, we'd      already learned from experience that "we'd have to get up      early in the morning" to protect a vegetable patch from our      two mixed terriers. The "devilish duo" would get under or      over any kind of fence we put in their way, and proceed to      mangle whatever plants they could find.    </p>    <p>      So. We used a little ingenuity and came up with a      <em>different</em> <em>kind</em> of garden that was      portable <em>and</em> pet-proof <em>and</em> productive all      at once. In short, we grew piles of tall-topped carrots,      juicy tomatoes, and a bevy of other fresh fruits and      vegetables . . . in baskets!    </p>    <p>      Now, I know that some dyed-in-the-wool traditionalists will      turn their noses up at any garden not rooted deep in Mother      Earth herself. But if your problems are similar to what      ours were, or if you live in a small city apartment, or if      you can't do all the stooping and bending that ground-level      planting and weeding requires . . . well, then a basket      garden can be a pretty good way to go!<br />    </p>    <p>      To start one, all you'll need is several containers large      enough to hold a sufficient amount of soil to support      living vegetation. In our case, we couldn't spend a fortune      on oversized ceramic pots, and we didn't have any good      "recyclables" (such as paint buckets or gallon-size plastic      milk jugs). So we scouted a local discount store, where we      discovered that ordinary clothes baskets were just fine for      our purposes (and inexpensive to boot). The bushel size      cost only 57 cents apiece, and the half-bushel just      37 cents . . . so we brought home three large and seventeen      small baskets for a total price of just $8.00!    </p>    <p>      Next, we lined the containers with plain old "Hefty type"      trash bags, and then filled the bottom of each with two      inches of coarse gravel for drainage. On top of that we      placed a layer of newspaper to keep the soil from washing      down into the stones.    </p>    <p>      Then we added the growing' medium itself. Gardening books      call for a 1: 1: 1 ratio of peat moss, loam, and sand . . .      and advise that rotted manure, leaves, grass clippings, and      other well-shredded vegetation can also be mixed in. We,      however, simply used three parts slightly, sandy (and      rocky) soil from an empty field, combined with one part      grass clippings judging from the way our plants thrived,      I'd say just about any reasonably rich blend of natural      materials that's light and loose enough to provide good      aeration will work OK.    </p>    <p>      Finally, we poked a few small holes in the base of the      lined containers to allow extra drainage, and placed stakes      in the baskets in which we intended to grow tomatoes and      peas.    </p>    <p>      A friend of ours had access to a number of wooden pallets      that some local factories wanted to dispose of so he gave      us two of the skids, from which we constructed a platform      that kept our "garden" well above the reach of canine      claws, but at just the right height for easy weeding. One      of the discards made an "instant tabletop", and a few      minutes' work with a crowbar and hammer gave us enough      usable lumber from the other to build supporting legs and      braces. (Incidentally, homesteaders might take note of the      fact that throwaway pallets are a good source of free wood      for rough construction. They can be used either      disassembled or as whole "prefab" sections in any number of      projects.)    </p>    <p>      The final step in establishing our vegetable patch, of      course, was the actual planting . . . but before jumping in      "seeds first", we referred to three books which were      especially helpful: [1] <em>Raise Vegetables Without a      Garden</em> by Doc and Katy Abraham (Countryside Books,      1974, $2.95); [2] <em>All About Vegetables</em> edited by      Walter Doty (regionally oriented editions, published by      Chevron Chemical Company, 1973, $2.95); and [3] <em>The      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) Almanac</em> (THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      (restricted) , Inc., 1973, $1.95).    </p>    <p>      This information?particularly the guides to natural pest      control and companion planting in MOTHER'S      <em>Almanac-</em> helped us choose the kinds of      vegetables and fruits we felt would be most productive and      best suited to our own needs and tastes.    </p>    <p>      We put two large-variety tomato plants (such as "Heinz" and      "Country Fair") in each bushel basket, and found that a      half-bushel container could accommodate either a pair of      small tomato vines (such as Burpee's "Early Girl") or four      good?size pepper plants. Our remaining baskets were seeded      with radishes, onions, carrots, peas, miniature corn,      strawberries, and cucumbers. We planted relatively early in      the season, kept the containers out in the sun on warm      days, and simply carried them back into the house whenever      a chill threatened. (My poor ole Dad lost two successive      sets of tomatoes to late frosts in his regular garden . . .      but our portable vegetables stayed cozy and warm-      <em>and healthy</em> ?the whole time.)    </p>    <p>      Obviously, there's much less moisture?retaining soil in a      "container garden" than in a conventional plot, so we did      have to give our "babies" frequent waterings. (One possible      solution might be to fold the tops of the trash bag liners      over the soil, punch holes in the sacks, and then let the      plants grow through. We haven't tried it yet, but suspect      the plastic would act as a good water?holding,      weed?stifling mulch.) We also had to add extra dirt      occasionally as the original material settled but aside      from those two minor measures and a little careful      bug-watching and ?squashing, and cultivating (none of which      ever required bending our backs) our food practically grew      by itself!    </p>    <p>      All that summer and fall, we enjoyed a vast and abundant      variety of fresh produce straight from one table (the      plants') to another (ours). And we never so much as picked      up stake the whole year!    </p>    <p>      So . . . you say supermarket prices are killing your      budget, but (moan, groan) you don't have space to grow your      own vegetables? Buy a bunch of baskets!    </p>
