                    <h5 id="byline">      by BUCK TAYLOR    </h5>    <p>      Can a fed-up corporate executive forfeit his pole position      in the rat race, build a $500 smokehouse out in the country      . . . and rapidly begin earning more than $2,000 a month      selling home-cured fish to bars and restaurants? Yep. Buck      Taylor, a Florida man, has done just that . . . and he      insists that others (maybe you) can do it too! All it      takes-he says?to get started in this do-it-yourself      business is a large oven, a load of fresh fish, some      hickory and oak logs, and an overriding desire to . . .    </p>        <p>      I've finally come full circle.    </p>    <p>      I started out, you see, as a healthy outdoorsman . . .      but-lured by promises of "super-money"?I quickly sold my      soul for admittance into The Land Of The Corporate      Executive. <em>The Management Team.</em> Where, I      eventually learned, the money was not nearly as good as I      had been led to believe . . . but where the hours      <em>were</em> long and the pressure <em>was</em>      tremendous.    </p>    <p>      As a result, I became just another frustrated pencil      pusher. My mental attitude soured. Bags appeared under my      eyes. I became chronically tired. My family life suffered.      I was rapidly becoming just another pale candidate for      ulcers or a heart attack. And then . . .    </p>    <p>      And then I got a grip on myself, hurled myself right off      that "prestige" treadmill to oblivion . . . and began to      "smoke" my way back to the freedom, independence, and      healthful outdoor life that I had originally known.    </p>    <h3>      "SMOKING" . . . AS IN FISH    </h3>    <p>      The lucrative enterprise which has given me back my life is      nothing but the smoking and selling of fish to bars,      restaurants, and individuals here in Miami. And, believe it      or not, I didn't know a thing about my new profession when      I first plunged in.<br />    </p>    <p>      All I was really sure of back then was that I desperately      wanted <em>out</em> of Executive Row. I had, in fact,      already made several false (and costly) starts toward the      freedom I so eagerly craved. I was, to put it another way,      something of a drowning man clutching at straws at that      point in my life . . . when some chance conversations with      seemingly successful people in the field directed my      attention to the smoking business.    </p>    <p>      Little wonder then that?although I knew nothing about      smoke-curing fish at the time?I was what you'd call "highly      motivated" to give the occupation a try. I optimistically      figured I could learn what I needed to know as I went      along. And I did! The thoughts of?at last!?being      self-employed (which danced through my head like visions of      sugarplums) made working out the details of my new life a      pleasure.    </p>    <h3>      THE INITIAL PLANNING . . .    </h3>    <p>      I started laying the foundation for my mini?enterprise by      visiting the smokehouses owned by other people who were      already in the fish curing and marketing business. Soon,      based on the information I picked up from these trips, I      [1] was reasonably sure that my longed-for occupation could      support my family, [2] had made an informed guess that our      savings account contained barely enough cash to set me up      in the smoking business, [3] knew of and had checked out      sources for the raw fish I'd need, and [4] was finishing      construction drawings for a smokehouse of my own .    </p>    <h3>      . . . AND THE ACTUAL FOUNDING OF MY BUSINESS    </h3>    <p>      All well and good . . . on paper. But just as I was ready      to dash off and build that smokehouse . . . I realized that      I didn't have any place to put the structure!    </p>    <p>      What I wanted, of course, was a fair-sized piece of land on      the side of a well-traveled road with clear approaches from      both directions so that [A] large numbers of passing      motorists could [ B] see my operation early enough to [C]      give potential customers the time they'd need to [D] pull      into my parking lot and [E] buy the large quantities of      cured fish I expected to sell!    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the ideal?and rather expansive?piece of      property I had in mind proved to be a lot harder to find      and a great deal more expensive to rent than I had      anticipated. What I had to settle for, when I came right      down to it, was a few square feet on an out-of-the-way farm      located off a back road several miles from town.    </p>    <p>      Still, that remote rural location did have some worthwhile      features all its own. First, it was very inexpensive.      Second, the license I needed for my business was both      easier to obtain and less costly way out there in the      country than it would have been if I'd tried to set my      smokehouse up in either the city or along a main road close      to Miami. Third, it was almost a sure bet that?sooner or      later?some of my urban neighbors would [A] object to the      light wisps of smoke from my operation or [B] try to break      into the smokehouse and steal its contents if I built the      structure in town. And it was just as sure a bet that no      one would ever give me either kind of trouble if I set the      house up out there in the sticks.    </p>    <p>      For obvious reasons, I quickly decided to establish my      business on that backwoods farm . . . and, with the      sometime?help of a few friends, I began construction of the      smokehouse the very next weekend. None of us really knew      what we were doing but the building wasn't too complicated      and?five weekends and $500 in materials later?it was      substantially completed. Then, while finishing touches were      still being made on the structure, we immediately "fired      up" the oven for the first time and began curing 50 pounds      of whiting fillets.<br />    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly enough, that initial batch of fish turned out      pretty well. A bit undercooked, perhaps, but the taste we      were after was definitely there. I got a lot of compliments      on the samples I distributed and two bars agreed, on the      spot, to buy my fish if I'd smoke the fillets a little      longer and make them somewhat saltier.    </p>    <p>      I enjoyed even more success the following weekend . . .      when I actually sold half my "samples" and began taking      orders for a third batch of fish. And that was only the      beginning: Within six weeks, I had recovered the $500 that      the materials for my smokehouse had cost and I was already      getting prepared to quit my office job and go into the      specialty food business full time!<br />    </p>    <p>      I've been "on my own" ever since, arid I can't tell you how      good it feels. How can you compare a boss' cigar smoke to      the delicate aroma of catfish cooking over hickory and oak      logs!    </p>    <h3>      YOU CAN DO IT TOO!    </h3>    <p>      Yes, I'm convinced that you can do just as well in this      field as I have . . . maybe even better. Study the market      in your area. If there aren't scads of commercial      smokehouses already fighting for the attention of every      potential customer, your chances can be considered      excellent.    </p>    <p>      Shop around. Find out where you can obtain a steady supply      of fish at a reasonable price (well below a dollar a      pound). Or?if smoked seafood is not particularly popular      where you live?look into the possibility of curing hams,      turkeys, cheese, or sausage. Even though this article      concentrates on fish, the basics that I cover can be      applied to <em>any</em> smoked food (as proof of that fact,      I even run off an occasional batch of other meats or cheese      in my own oven).    </p>    <p>      Once you're sure that you've lined up a steady supply of      raw materials at an acceptable price, examine your      financial situation (as I did) and decide if you want to      set your smoker up on a well-traveled?and      expensive?boulevard or (as I was forced to do) out in the      sticks. My feeling is still that a good roadside location      is worth its price, if you can swing it.    </p>    <p>      Next visit your city's or county's license bureau, the      pollution control people (if necessary), and any other      officials who legally have anything to say about how you      house and operate this business in your area. Find out what      it takes to keep these people smiling . . . and do it.    </p>    <p>      And finally?after you've done the above homework, you've      built your smokehouse, and you've run off a sample batch or      two of your specialty-the only thing left for you to      do is to distribute samples to a few potential customers.      And if that last step in the establishment of this      enterprise worries you, just remember one thing: <em>My      experience leads me to believe that smoked fish and other      such specialties will sell to restaurants and bars anywhere      . . . IF you produce a quality product.</em>    </p>    <h3>      A SHORT COURSE IN SMOKEHOUSE CONSTRUCTION    </h3>		    <p>      I won't say that you have to build your smoker exactly the      way I built mine (if I learned anything from those initial      visits to other seafood-smoking establishments, it was that      there are at least 1,003 different ways to construct a      smokehouse). Just so you will have an idea of what the task      involves, however, I'll take you through the steps I      followed in constructing my smoker. (A floor plan is shown      in Fig. 1.)    </p>    <p>      [1] First we removed all rocks, stumps, etc., from the      ground we had chosen for our construction site and we      leveled the area. Then we built a 12' X 20' foundation form      out of 2 X 4's, crisscrossed the space within the form with      hog wire and steel rods (for reinforcement), and poured the      12' X 20' four-inch-thick slab of concrete on a sunny day.      (Figure on about 3-1/2 cubic yards of mix for a slab this      size.)    </p>    <p>      [2] After the foundation had cured for 48 hours, we were      ready to put up the walls for our smokehouse. To do that,      we laid four rows of block (which made a wall 32" high),      sealed the top course with concrete, and then framed the      structure on up eight feet tall in front and seven in the      back with 2 X 4's. The building was finished with window      screen all around to keep out insects and topped with the      least expensive galvanized roofing we could buy.    </p>    <p>      [3] The attached oven was constructed a little differently.      Its walls are block all the way to the top (nine rows, or      72"), topped with a three-inch-thick poured concrete roof.      Although the outside dimensions of our oven measure      approximately five by seven feet, I think the unit would be      a lot handier to use if we'd have made it six feet wide.      Use your own judgment.    </p>    <p>      Whatever you do, though, don't forget to leave the      16"square opening on the floor of the oven's outside or      "back" wall (so you'll have a way to slide the firebox in      and out). Nor should you forget to allow for a      large-say 4' X 5'?main door (through which you'll      load and unload fish) between the oven and the smokehouse .      . . or to leave an 18"-square hole right in the center of      the oven's roof (for a chimney).    </p>    <p>      The firebox door can be framed in with 2 X 4's and closed      with a close-fitting cover (a 2 X 4 frame faced on the      outside with 3/8" or 1/2" plywood, packed with insulation,      and faced on the inside?to protect it from the flame's      heat?with ungalvanized metal) that is hinged along its top.      The main loading door (also a 2 X 4 frame faced on the      outside with 3/8" or 1/2" plywood, packed with insulation,      and faced on the inside with ungalvanized metal) should be      hinged on its left edge so that it'll swing flat against      the smokehouse wall as shown in the drawing with this      article. And the chimney is made of three solid rows of a      concrete block and a half each, topped by four spaced      blocks, covered with a sheet of metal (to keep the rain      out), and topped again by four spaced blocks (to hold the      piece of metal in place).    </p>    <p>      If you lay a sheet of plastic over the form for the oven's      roof, by the way, the finished ceiling will be plenty      smooth enough to use with no further work. (Do remember,      however, to peel away the plastic before you cure your      first batch of fish!) The inside of the oven's walls should      be painted with a coat or two of water mixed with cement to      seal the pores in the blocks.    </p>    <p>      [4] The firebox that sits on the oven's floor is simply a      3/16" sheet steel container that measures one foot high,      one foot across, and five feet long. Mount a handle on one      end of the box and make a stick (a broom handle with a hook      screwed into one end will do) that you can use to grab the      handle and pull the box out with when it's hot.    </p>    <p>      [5] A flat sheet of steel must be suspended over the      firebox to spread its blaze and keep the flames from      burning the fish that will be loaded into the oven. We cut      our spreader plate from 1/4" steel so that?when the sheet      of metal was supported at each corner on upturned concrete      blocks?there was a six-inch gap on all four sides between      the edges of the steel plate and the walls of the oven.    </p>    <p>      [6] The wooden stand which holds our fish as they're being      smoked was made to fit quite snugly inside the finished      oven. The rack contains five shelves spaced 10" apart      vertically . . . although this vertical spacing is not      terribly important. What <em>is</em> important is the      frame's legs: if they're made of wood, keep them as far as      possible from the oven's firebox (so that even the most      violent "back-draft" down the smoker's chimney can't force      flames over against the legs and ignite them). An even      better bet, of course, is to use angle iron for your rack's      main structural members.    </p>    <p>      [7] The trays (ten of them) which rest on the wooden stand      each measure 2' X 3' and they fit two to a rack. We made      ours from scrap 1 X 2's with 1 "-by 2"-grid wire stapled      (stapling is easier than nailing) across their tops. NOTE:      Use only plain, uncoated wire on these trays. The      galvanized mesh of hardware cloth will give off toxic fumes      when heated.    </p>    <p>      [8] We built the cleaning and work tables in our smokehouse      very quickly and easily by mounting half sheets of plywood      on 2 X 4 frames. And we were sure to give that plywood      <em>several coats</em> of good varnish. (The tables      <em>do</em> get drenched with brine and fish juice and,      left unprotected, the wood wouldn't last long.) The      cleaning table was slanted slightly toward a hole cut into      its out-of-the-way end. And there was a particular reason      for that.    </p>    <p>      The preparation of smoked fish produces two types of waste.      The first?an accumulation of heads, backbones, and      entrails?must be packaged, hauled away, and dumped. There's      no getting around it. The second kind of waste, though?the      hundreds of tiny bits 'and slivers that appear as you slice      the fish for the oven (especially after they've soaked      overnight in brine)?can be disposed of somewhat easier. You      can either [A] push them to the back of your cleaning      table, scrape them off into a trap mounted under that hole      mentioned in the last paragraph, and then dump them into a      garbage pail, or [B] flush the particles through that same      hole into a drainpipe connected to a 12-foot-deep dry well      dug just outside the smokehouse . . . and simply let the      little bits of fish, brine, and cleaning water all      percolate away into the soil. (That's what I did, and I've      found that this method of doing away with such waste won't      taint a nearby water well, as long as it's ten or more feet      away from the percolation hole.)    </p>    <p>      [9] An old five-foot-long porcelain bathtub?as long as it's      not cracked or chipped?makes an ideal brine tank. Mount it      on a simple frame that both holds it steady and tilts it      slightly toward a drainpipe connected to the same dry well      that drains the cleaning table.    </p>    <p>      [10] And finally, you must find a way to get water to your      smokehouse . . . even if you have to bring it in through a      hose. Electricity is not absolutely essential, since the      sun can provide natural lighting if you work only during      the day and?more likely than not?you'll want to keep your      storage refrigerator at home. But you will use water at the      smokehouse in large quantities and frequently.    </p>    <h3>      ODDS AND ENDS    </h3>    <p>      Once you have your smokehouse up and finished, you'll need      only a few other pieces of equipment to put you in the      fish-curing business. Probably the most expensive is a      really <em>big</em> refrigerator (remember, you'll be able      to process 500 pounds of meat at a time in the smoker I've      just described). I bought my commercial-sized reefer      secondhand at a restaurant supply house, and I recommend      that you check out the same source (or sources) in your      area.    </p>    <p>      And while you're there, look around for a heavy-duty oven      thermometer with a temperature range of at least 50° F      to 225° F (0° to 300° F is even better). An      adequate thermometer can be purchased for about $35, but      don't hesitate to spend more for one of exceptional      quality. That thermometer?mounted in the center of your      oven's main door, with its probe sticking several inches      into the curing chamber?is probably the single piece of      equipment most critical to the success of your whole      operation.    </p>    <p>      The last major item you'll need is a trailer of some sort      in which to haul 750 to 1,000 pounds of fresh fish at a      time in from the docks. (Remember, once you're rolling,      you'll make your money by keeping that oven <em>full.</em>      ) Of course this doesn't mean that your trailer has to be      anything fancy. A homemade rig with a 4' X 8' plywood      floor, 3' sides, and a plywood lid to keep the sun off does      the job for me. On the other hand, if you have to bring      your fish in from a long distance away, you'd be well      advised to carry the iced seafood in a watertight trailer      that's insulated with 3/4" styrofoam and painted silver on      the outside . . . and such a rig will, naturally, cost you      more than mine cost me.    </p>    <p>      The remaining supplies you'll need for your new business      can all be bought or scrounged fairly inexpensively. They      include:    </p>    <p>      [1] A good quality cleaning knife, 10" blade or longer.      Keep this baby sharp.<br />      [2] A hose and nozzle for washing down fish, brine tank,      floor, and oven.<br />      [3] A paintbrush?four inches wide?for coating fish trays      with oil.<br />      [4] A wire brush with which to clean the smoker trays after      a batch of fish has been processed.<br />      [5] A wooden tablespoon, for measuring and stirring.<br />      [6] A clock, for timing the high- and low-temperature      phases of the cure.<br />      [7] Bleach, which is used to swab the floor daily (to      eliminate bug traffic).<br />      [8] Cooking oil, <em>non-iodized</em> salt, spices, and      firewood.    </p>    <p>      About that very last item: I use Australian pine as well as      oak in my oven. Hickory is almost impossible to get here in      southern Florida and commands a ridiculous price when you      <em>can</em> find it. No matter what kind of firewood      <em>you</em> decide to use?and as you can see from the      accompanying table, there are many varieties to choose      from?don't pick one that's heavy with sap. For example,      common yellow pine can ruin your smoked fish by imparting      the less-than-delicate flavor of turpentine to the fillets!    </p>    <p>      Keep your firewood covered and dry when not in use. This      will ensure that the fuel burns uniformly and will make      your fires a lot easier to start.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR S NOTE: This has been the first half of a two-part      article. In MOTHER NO. 40, Mr. Taylor will describe how he      cleans and smokes the fish that he sells.    </p>    <h3>      Smoking for dollars: the profit picture    </h3>    <p>      All right. You've chatted with fish dealers, checked out      locations, given it some careful thought, and decided you      just <em>may</em> want to try your hand at selling smoked      fish. Great! Now you're probably wondering?and rightly      so-what kind of money a person can really, truly make      in this business.    </p>    <p>      Well, one man knows the answer to that as well as anyone,      and that one man is Buck Taylor of Miami, Florida. Buck?who      began his operation with no special knowledge or      experience?has been "smoking" for a living, full time,      since April of 1975 . . . and he now regularly earns $600      per week (and more). "It's a supernice do-it-yourself      enterprise," says Buck, "if you don't mind getting your      hands dirty a couple of days a week."    </p>    <p>      With regard to the <em>business</em> of running a      smokehouse, Buck Taylor has this advice to offer MOTHER's      readers:    </p>    <p>      "First of all, in establishing your price structure,      consider the audience you're selling to. Will they buy at      $3.00 a pound? If so, fine . . . but in any case, you      should charge a <em>minimum</em> of $2.00 a pound for your      product (more, if you decide to add a few spices and label      it gourmet food). <em>An ovenload of fish?approximately 500      pounds?at that price should bring in over $1,000.</em>    </p>    <p>      "When you calculate your expenses, don't forget that at      least 30% of the weight of an uncleaned fish eventually      ends up as waste. The <em>average</em> is more like 40% and      you'll lose over 50% when you clean some species, such as      amberjack. In addition, still more weight loss occurs in      the oven. It <em>does</em> help to leave the skins on      fillets . . . but even so, a good 20% of an ovenload will      drip onto the fire-shield or simply 'go up in smoke'.    </p>    <p>      "Let's consider a typical situation. Suppose you bought      1,000 pounds of kingfish at 50 cents per. This half ton of      uncleaned fish will actually 'fillet out' at around 600      oven-ready pounds. Another 180 pounds (30%) will disappear      in cooking, leaving you with 420 pounds of cured fish for      which?in its raw form?you paid $500. Taking into account      wood, spices, gas for the truck, etc., your expenses thus      far total, say, $510.    </p>    <p>      "Now, if you sell those 420 pounds of cured fish for $2.00      per pound, then your gross income will be $840 . . . and      the net profit comes to $840 minus $510, or a nifty $330.      Not bad for a day and a half of work! This is assuming that      you sell all of what you cook. Note, however, that if you      had paid 75 cents a pound for the raw fish, you would only      have come out ahead $80 for the whole ovenload. In this      instance, the thing to do would be to raise the selling      price to $2.25 or $2.50."    </p>    <p>      Are big game fish where the big money is in the fishsmoking      biz?    </p>    <p>      "Interestingly enough, my best-selling items are <em>little      two-ounce packages</em> of hard-cooked strips. Bars?and      corner groceries that sell beer?buy these by the hundreds      and resell for a modest profit, knowing full well that the      salt in them makes customers crave beer! Naturally, there's      a good bit more labor in cutting out the small strips than      in preparing large fillets for the oven. However, the      little packs bring me 35 cents each?or $2.80 a pound?and      man, do they sell!    </p>    <p>      "Another lucrative area is custom smoking for fishermen.      Once you're established, outdoorsmen will occasionally      bring all or part of their catch to you for curing. The      advantages to this are that you get paid in advance and      bear no real added costs if you were going to smoke an      ovenload anyway.    </p>    <p>      "I charge a fee of 45 cents per pound for whole fish, while      headless fish go into the oven for 55 cents a pound, and      fillets 65 cents. It's a good idea to set some sort of size      limit for raw fish: say, nothing under ten pounds. This way      you save yourself a lot of unnecessary labor . . . and a      fisherman isn't likely to be disappointed when he sees how      tiny his catch is as it emerges from the oven. Those      smaller fish really shrink during cooking!    </p>    <p>      "At holiday time, you can pick up a sizable sales bonus by      smoking turkeys. The big birds must stay in the oven longer      than most fish do, but they take a delicious cure and sell      easily."    </p>    <p>      Taylor is quick to point out that there's more to making it      with your own fish-smoking enterprise than merely having      the requisite desire, a place to work, and a boundless      supply of fish and hickory.    </p>    <p>      "Don't get caught without the proper pieces of paper. If      you're located outside city limits?as I am?chances are all      you'll need is a $5.00 vendor's license. However, city      governments differ widely in their requirements, so about      all I can say is <em>be sure you satisfy all local      ordinances.</em>    </p>    <p>      "Saltwater fish are usually the easiest to come by in      quantity, so make certain you know which species?if any?are      illegal to sell in your area. Also, a Fish & Game      permit is often needed before you can handle freshwater      fish products. This costs five bucks but is generally well      worth the money since some freshwater species-channel      catfish in particular?just can't be beat after they've been      smoked for hours over a slow-burning fire!    </p>    <p>      "About location: I can't emphasize too strongly that a      boulevard location with plenty of road and foot traffic is      a real plus. Of course, you can always go out and hustle      bars and restaurants for a steady income . . . but, with      walk-in business, that won't even be necessary. A good      location on the highway <em>will</em> set you back more for      rent than a rural operation?and may present more problems      with zoning laws?but is, nonetheless, something that you      should consider carefully."    </p>
