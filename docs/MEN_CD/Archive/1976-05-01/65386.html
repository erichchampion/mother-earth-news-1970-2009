                   <h5 id="byline">     by BERNIE LICHTENSTEIN    </h5>    <p>     </p>            <p>      One day Barbara-that's my best friend-and I got      this crazy idea: Why not try to make a spinning wheel?    </p>    <p>      Up until then, Barbara had been spinning our "homegrown"      wool (which comes from a little black sheep and a white      woolly that we keep here on our ten acres) on a drop      spindle. In case you didn't know, a drop spindle is nothing      more than a tapered dowel-weighted at the      bottom-which you hold vertically and let rotate while      pulling wool from the top. It's a slow-but-simple way to      spin wool.    </p>    <p>      Now, it takes a long time to make even a two- or threeounce      skein by the drop spindle method. Not that it isn't fun . .      . Barbara loves it. (The way I see it, you've <em>got</em>      to love spinning to do it in the first place!) But an      honest-to-goodness spinning wheel . . . now <em>that</em>      would certainly make the whole process a lot easier, and a      lot quicker.    </p>    <p>      We thought awhile, and-after seeing diagrams and      pictures of homemade wheels in <em>Foxfire</em> <em>2</em>      -decided we couldn't wait any longer. We started to      track down materials.    </p>    <p>      "Look!" we exclaimed when we spotted some half-inch and      one-inch dowels-perfect to use as the spindle and      holder-in the garage. "Hey!" we blurted when we      happened across a rough piece of split oak, about four feet      long, to use for the platform. I won't even mention what we      said when we discovered some pieces of green oak suitable      for legs in our firewood pile.    </p>    <p>      Our biggest piece of luck-considering we're both just      unskilled novices when it comes to things      mechanical-was finding a ready-made wheel. It came      off a lonely old abandoned bicycle in the junkyard. At 24      inches in diameter, it wasn't quite as large as the wheels      in <em>Foxfire</em> <em>2,</em> but it looked as if it      would do the trick . . . and it did!    </p>    <p>      We made one simple modification to the old bike wheel:      namely, what we did was [1] strip the tire and inner tube      from our much appreciated find, [2] cut a long strip from      the tube, and [3] glue this strip of rubber back onto the      rim. We figured this'd-make a nice smooth runway to guide      the loop of twine that runs between spindle and wheel and      keeps everything in motion.    </p>    <p>      From that point, the actual construction of our spinning      wheel was a cinch. All we did was mount the components in      their proper positions (see photos), copying what we'd seen      in pictures of <em>other</em> folks' wheels, and      viol√†! We had a device that really, honestly worked      (much to my amazement). This was the first time I'd ever      put anything with moving parts together.    </p>    <p>      Someday, I suppose I'll try to attach a foot pedal to our      masterpiece . . . but for now, we're just happy to have      something that works, and which is quicker and easier to      use than a drop spindle.    </p>    <p>      You might be able to <em>buy</em> a spinning wheel, new,      for around $50. The one Barbara and I put together cost      $2.50-mostly for the epoxy and Weldwood that holds it      together-and it couldn't do a better job at any      price!    </p>
