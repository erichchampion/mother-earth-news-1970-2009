                   <h5 id="byline">    by PHYLLIS HOBSON    </h5>    <p>      In our midwestern country kitchen, you can always determine      the season of the year without looking at the calendar or      checking the outside thermometer. just glance around . . .      and let your eyes and your <em>nose</em> identify the      month.    </p>    <p>      When the kitchen has a green aroma-a smell of wet      clay pots and potting soil and spindly tomato plants      growing on the windowsill, of pungent marigold seedlings,      of tiny but perfect green pepper plants?it's early April.      No matter how cold and rainy it may be outside at that      time, the room is filled with the warm and humid atmosphere      of next summer's garden. Its countertops are covered with      boxes of fresh vegetable seeds from Henry Field and Burpee      . . . and envelopes of " oldies but goodies" that we've      saved ourselves from last year's crop. And tucked into one      of the containers (right beside the first-to-be-planted      radish seeds), is a folded, much-erased, out-of-scale,      out-of-perspective drawing of the coming summer's vegetable      patch.<br />    </p>    <p>      By the middle of May, our early garden is in the ground and      the air has warmed so much outside that wAe opened the      kitchen's windows just a crack. The scent of purple lilacs      waft into the room where it mixes with the smell of tiny,      just-up green onions brought in from the salad bed and the      aroma of the season's first asparagus shoots as they're      blanched for the freezer. A pan of bright-pink rhubarb      simmering on the back of the cookstove adds its tang to the      room's atmosphere, and the faintly yeasty perfume that      occasionally drifts up from the basement comes from the      rhubarb wine that is already working away downstairs.    </p>    <p>      Just inside the kitchen door is a bucket of grape roots      waiting to be planted. And over on the countertop?between      the stainless steel milking pail and the egg basket?are a      pair of root beer bottles capped with black rubber nipples      . . . a sure sign of new kids in the barn. It's mid-May all      right. Can June be far behind?    </p>    <p>      June is strawberry month here in the Midwest and we're soon      keeping a running tally of the number of boxes of the fruit      that pass through the kitchen. And we revel in the      mouthwatering, sweet fragrance of the berries as they're      washed and stemmed and coated with a syrup made of honey.      As they're sealed in milk cartons and stored in the      freezer. As they're simmered into red, juicy      preserves.<br />    </p>    <p>      And then?suddenly! before we've finished the last of the      strawberrieswe're bringing in peas from the garden. Baskets      and sacks and buckets and pans of green-podded peas.    </p>    <p>      The kitchen-is filled with workers. With shellers and      blanchers and chillers. With packers and sealers and      canners. Every possible container, it seems, is filled as      we hurry the fragile (but delicious) vegetable from the      garden to the <em>freezer</em> and the canning jars and the      drying trays. The lingering smell of the fresh peas is      everywhere.    </p>    <p>      By July the goats are in full production and our farmstead      kitchen has been turned into a dairy processing plant. Pans      of surplus milk chill in the " extra" refrigerator out on      the back porch. jars of skimmed-off cream wait to be      churned into butter. Slabs and rounds of cheese are drained      and pressed and aged in out-of-the-way nooks.    </p>    <p>      The kitchen's windows are opened wide by early morning on      most July days and the rich aroma of "good eatin' " pours      from them as this spring's chicken fries, last fall's beans      bake, the summer's first sweet corn steams in a huge      enameled kettle, and fresh green beans gently bubble with a      slab of ham.    </p>    <p>      As July turns into August, other savory odors are added to      these summer smells . . . as peaches simmer and are sealed      into glass jars, raspberry jelly boils over, and early      apples cook into applesauce. And once a day the tiny      gherkins soaking in spicy syrup, ,the sliced cucumbers and      onions covered by sweetened vinegar, and the fat dills      submerged in salty brine contribute their own tang to the      room when they're skimmed and stirred and heated.    </p>    <p>      Tomatoes dominate our September kitchen. Tomatoes being      canned. juiced. Purded. Peeled. Cored. Cooked into ketchup.      Seasoned into sauce. Canning jars line the counter. Empty      jars, fresh from a sterilizing boil, drain upside down in      the sink. And sealed jars?filled with tomatoes?cool over in      a corner, out of the draft.<br />    </p>    <p>      Just before October's first frost, the remnants of the      garden are brought into the kitchen. Basketfuls of tiny,      green tomatoes are chopped and ground and mixed with      onions, ripe peppers, and cucumbers . . . then simmered in      vinegar and spices and bottled and sealed as relish. In      another kettle, ground green tomatoes are stirred with      chopped apples and raisins and cinnamon . . . and canned      for Thanksgiving's mincemeat pie. The snap and tang of the      relish and mincemeat seasoning combines well with the      fragrance of late?apple apple dumplings and the      irresistible aroma of simmering apple butter.    </p>    <p>      When the smell of pumpkin pie blends into the odor of      celery dressing baked with the fattest hen in the chicken      yard, you know it's late Norvember. And when the kitchen is      bursting with the aroma of baking fruitcakes, it's      December.    </p>    <p>      In January the kitchen is a warm haven after the outside      chores are done. Its bubbling pots of homemade soup . . .      its crunchy, crusty loaves of brown bread . . . and its      warm rice pudding provide the background as we spread out      the year's bright, new seed catalogs and plan the coming      summer's garden on graph paper.    </p>    <p>      Friends and neigh bors?restive after months indoors?stop by      during February. They stomp into the kitchen in their heavy      barn boots, yellow work gloves, and fleece-lined coats.      They fill the room with the steam of their breath and the      sound of their hearty farm humor. And we all consume great      pots of smoking coffee and piles of fist-sized oatmeal      cookies.    </p>    <p>      By March, the s cents of brown earth and black potting      soil?of peat and rich compost-are beginning to creep      back into the kitchen . . . and it's time to start all over      again.    </p>
