        <p>From <em>The Handbook of Natural Beauty</em> ©1975 by Virginia Castleton. Permission granted by Rodale Press, Inc., Emmaus, Pa. 18049.</p><p>There's no need to spend part of your hard-earned allowance on store-bought beauty preparations. In fact, most everything you'll need to stay fit and healthy looking can be found right in your own kitchen, as this excerpt from <em>The Handbook of Natural Beauty</em> explains.</p><p>"You are what you eat"-there is indeed a measure of truth to the old adage. Regular intake of different kinds of foods is reflected by your body in skin and hair conditions, and in weight gains or losses. While you are caring for your body's external needs, consider also how your diet can help to solve (or create) beauty problems.</p><p>The first requirement for health and beauty is a well balanced diet, containing all the vital nutrients in proportions tailored to your physical frame, age, sex and lifestyle. Very basically, aim for a diet that includes a variety of foods from the four major food groups-meats and fish, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, grain products. Feed your skin the same nutrients the rest of your body needs.</p><p>Generally speaking, foods that cause problems for healthy skin and hair are the same foods that may harm a healthy body. Try to avoid refined sugar, saturated animal fats, fried or heavily processed foods, and all kinds of junk foods.</p><p>Listed below are some foods that should be emphasized in a well balanced diet plan to help clear up specific problems.</p><p><strong>THE SKIN</strong><br /><br /><strong>OILY SKIN</strong></p><p>Helpful foods-fresh fruits and vegetables (and their juices), fish, poultry, lean meats, eggs, whole grain cereals</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-brewer's yeast</p><h3>DRY SKIN</h3><p>Helpful foods-polyunsaturated vegetable, seed or nut oils, protein-rich foods</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-vitamins A and E<br /></p><h3>DULL OR MUDDY SKIN</h3><p>Helpful foods-yogurt, apricots</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-brewer's yeast, vitamin B complex</p><h3>BLEMISHED SKIN</h3><p>Helpful foods-fresh green vegetables, almonds, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, cranberry juice, cucumbers, liver, carrots, sweet potatoes, apricots</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-vitamins A, B-complex, and E, bone meal or calcium lactate, lecithin, magnesium</p><h3>THE HAIR</h3><h3>OILY HAIR</h3><p>Helpful foods-fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, poultry, lean meats, whole grain cereals</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-vitamin B-complex, vitamin A</p><h3>DRY HAIR</h3><p>Helpful foods-one to two tablespoons unprocessed vegetable, seed or nut oil each day, cod-liver oil</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-vitamin E, vitamin A</p><h3>DANDRUFF</h3><p>Helpful foods-liver, cod-liver oil, unsaturated vegetable oils, wheat germ, fresh fruits and vegetables, protein-rich foods</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-desiccated liver, brewer's yeast, bone meal, lecithin</p><h3>FADING COLOR</h3><p>Helpful foods-liver, wheat germ, blackstrap molasses, sunflower seeds, whole grain cereals, rice polish, seafood, yogurt, cold-pressed vegetable and nut oils</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-brewer's yeast, kelp, vitamin B-complex</p><h3>THE EYES</h3><p>Helpful foods-leafy green and yellow vegetables, wheat germ, rice polish, molasses, sunflower seeds</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-vitamins A, B-complex, C, D and E, brewer's yeast, bone meal or calcium lactate</p><h3>THE TEETH</h3><p>Helpful foods-crusty and fibrous foods, raw, crisp vegetables, fresh fruits</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-vitamins A, C and D, bone meal</p><h3>THE NAILS</h3><p>Helpful foods-almonds, liver, blackstrap molasses, apricots, eggs, wheat germ, whole grain cereals, protein foods, horsetail tea</p><p>Supplemental suggestions-vitamin A, brewer's yeast, zinc, calcium lactate</p><h3>THE OVERWEIGHT TORSO</h3><p>Helpful foods-fresh fruits, raw vegetables, sunflower seeds, apricots, dates, yogurt, fibrous foods</p><h3>THE UNDERWEIGHT TORSO</h3><p>Helpful foods-milk, eggs, cheese, meats, poultry, fresh fruits and vegetables</p>
