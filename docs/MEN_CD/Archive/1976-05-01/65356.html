                    <h5 id="byline">      by RICHARD HILTON    </h5>        <p>      Maybe there's still some city dweller left in me, or      perhaps I've just grown too accustomed to the conveniences      of modern-day American life . . . but if there's one thing      my year-round living quarters <em>must</em> have, it's      running water. Thus, when I finally built my      long-dreamed-of log cabin in Virginia-off in the      woods, with no electricity-I resolved that the      dwelling would be equipped with certain luxuries. Namely, a      shower, a flush toilet, and a sink tap that really worked!    </p><p>Now that didn't seem to me to be much to ask . . . but    after giving the problem some thought, I found that I wasn't    at all sure just where my precious water system's    <em>pressure</em> was going to come from. Initially, I    figured that a storage tank (which could easily be refilled    by a little gasoline engine-driven pump) perched in the    cabin's loft would probably handle the job satisfactorily.    When I imagined what the inevitable leak in that tank would    do to my dwelling's living area, however, I scrapped    <em>that</em> idea fast!</p>    <p>      The solution to my dilemma turned out to be a 375-gallon      steel tank mounted atop a 15-foot-high platform at the edge      of the clearing outside my cabin (see Fig. 1). The weight      of the water stored in this elevated container produces      about six pounds of static pressure in the cabin's water      lines. This is less than the pressure supplied by most city      systems and electric pumps . . . but is enough so that my      shower delivers a pleasant, gentle spray and my toilet's      flush tank refills without any annoying hiss.    </p>    <p>      In short, I've had nothing but success with my make-do      water system . . . and I'd like nothing better than to tell      you how <em>you</em> can construct your own version of the      Hilton Homestead Water Tower.    </p><h3>MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      Start by obtaining a galvanized steel tank-the kind      with a pipe fitting in the bottom and a conical lid on      top-through one of the farm catalogs for around $140      (at least that's what I paid for mine three years ago).      This will be the most costly part of your system.    </p>    <p>      By the way, as you flip through those farm catalogs, you      may notice a listing or two for redwood tanks (which are      often less expensive than steel). You should realize,      however, that such containers have two drawbacks: First, if      one is allowed to dry out it can develop permanent leaks.      Second-and I consider this point to be even more      important-if you purchase such a unit you'll be      supporting the rather unsavory crowd that is currently      making a fast buck by massacring our nation's dwindling      supply of redwoods. So buy a steel tank.    </p>    <p>      Since water weighs eight pounds per gallon, no mathematical      wizardry is needed to see that 375 gallons of the liquid      (which is what a tank four feet tall and four feet in      diameter will hold) tips the scales at a ton and a half.      That's quite a bit of weight for a wooden tower to support      right there, so you can figure that a storage container any      <em>larger</em> might well tax your ability to construct      its supporting understructure. On the other hand, it's a      fair bet that you'll soon tire of constantly refilling a      tank which is any <em>smaller</em> . I've found 375 gallons      to be a good compromise, then, between keeping the water      tower's design simple . . . and having an adequate supply      of the vital fluid on hand at all times.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, I had many fine pine trees growing here on my      backwoods homesite . . . so I had no trouble finding and      felling four 15-foot-long legs (each of which averaged ten      inches in diameter, minus bark) for my tower. Whatever you      use for your tower's main uprights, be sure they're      <em>more than</em> strong enough for the job. Remember, I      used poles that were ten <em>inches</em> in diameter!    </p>    <p>      If-like me-you make your storage tower's legs      of wood, you're well advised to take precautions to      preserve them. Insects like to eat away at trees just below      their layers of bark, you know, and woodpeckers-in      turn-make holes in that same wood to feed on those      insects. Both these "forces of nature" tend to weaken      timber. Sometimes so much that they compromise its      strength. The first thing you should do to your soon-to-be      tower legs, then, is strip away all their bark and (if      possible) set the logs out to dry for the summer. Then,      give each one a double coat of creosote. (Telephone      poles-if you're lucky enough to get your hands on      some-are ideal for your purpose, since they've been      given a creosote treatment that's far superior to anything      you're likely to do in your backyard.)    </p>    <h3>      DECISIONS    </h3>    <p>      I was faced with another dilemma when I got ready to erect      my water tower: I could either [1] lay a foundation, build      the support structure from the ground up, and get a crane      (which was out of the question, since there are no cranes      within 25 miles of here) to lift the storage tank into      place, or [2] construct the tower on its side on the      ground, tip it up, and then anchor the whole edifice in      place. Some of my friends assured me that I'd be crazy to      try the second plan . . . but I didn't seem to have much      choice, so that's the one I chose.    </p>    <p>      For a foundation, I decided simply to lay down four cinder      blocks-top surfaces flush with the earth's      surface-to support the tower initially, after which I      could anchor the erected tower both to the blocks and the      ground with a pour of concrete.    </p>    <h3>      THE TOWER    </h3>        <p>      I began by building my tower in two identical      halves-a front and a back-right on the ground.      For this part of the project, I worked from an outline      drawing (which had major dimensions to scale) much like the      sketch shown in Fig. 2.    </p>    <p>      The 3/4-inch-deep notches in the tower's legs (see Fig. 3)      were made to accommodate the necessary cross braces. (By      the way, at that point in the fabrication of the tower, the      legs had not yet been cut to exact length and each one was      about a foot too long on both ends.) I made the notches for      the braces by taking five or so closely spaced chain saw      cuts in the wood-at right angles to a leg's      length-and then gouging the indentation out flat with      a chisel. The notches didn't turn out to be nearly as      smooth as Fig. 3 would have you believe, by the way . . .      but good brace contact is important, so do strive for clean      cuts.    </p>    <p>      I decided to connect the braces to the legs with 5-inch lag      screws and washers-rather than long      nails-because I felt that spikes would lose their      holding power as the wood dried and weathered over a long      period of time. Also, I knew there would be a lot of strain      on these joints when it came time to tilt the tower into an      upright position . . . and I surely didn't want any part of      the structure to fail <em>then.</em> Only lag screws, I      thought, would give me the safety I desired.    </p>    <p>      After each pair of legs had been connected with braces,      some friends helped me put the two halves of the tower      together. Using boxes and firewood as supports (.Fig. 4),      we positioned one completed tower half directly above its      identical twin-which was lying flat on the      ground-and tied them together with cross braces. We      also rigged small cables (made of TV antenna guy wire      material) between diagonally opposed legs to add extra      strength and rigidity to the structure.    </p>        <p>      At that point, it was time to trim the legs to length. I      did this by [1] measuring off the proper distance (see Fig.      4) from the horizontal leg braces to the rough-sawn bottom      and top ends of the logs, [2] marking each spot with a      thumbtack, and [3] wrapping a string around the four poles      at these points. Then-using a lumber crayon-I      marked a line along the cord, removed the string and      thumbtacks, and made my cuts with the chain saw.    </p>    <p>      Thus, with little difficulty, I had built a sturdy tower      that was four feet wide at the top, seven feet across at      the bottom, and a couple inches short of fifteen feet tall.    </p><h3>THE UPPER PLATFORM</h3>        <p>      Once the tower's legs had been evened off, I was ready to      top the structure with the four-foot-square platform on      which I planned to place my 375-gallon galvanized steel      tank.    </p>    <p>      I began the deck by cutting two four-foot sills from an      eight-inch diameter, eight-foot-long log. I next scraped      one side of each sill flat with a drawknife. Then I had a      helper hold the logs, one by one, to the top end of the      tower while I marked the contact points on each piece's      underside. Finally, I cut notches at these contact points,      as shown in Fig. 5.    </p>    <p>      (Incidentally, the distance between notches was not exactly      the same for each sill . . . because the tower legs were      not what you could call really straight. I had known that      the uprights were slightly bowed when I began, but I used      them anyway because I figured their curvature wouldn't      affect the tower's load-carrying ability . . . and so far,      it hasn't.)    </p>    <p>      After a good deal of trimming and trial assembly, I      positioned the sills parallel with the tower's horizontal      braces and with each other. Then I spiked them firmly in      place and nailed four-foot-long floorboards across the      sills. I calculated that spikes <em>were</em> appropriate      for these joints since gravity ultimately holds this part      of the structure together.    </p>    <h3>      TOPPING IT ALL OFF    </h3>    <p>      To lash the tank in place, I first traced out a circle four      feet in diameter and centered on the finished platform.      Next, I nailed down a triangular block of wood just outside      the circle's perimeter-at each of the deck's four      corners. Then I rolled the big steel drum into      position-which wasn't difficult to do, since it      maneuvered quite easily on the ground-and lashed it      down with five-foot lengths of strap iron bent to conform      to the shape of the tank's rim. Finally, I used screws to      attach these anchoring straps to the tower legs.    </p>    <h3>      THE BIG EVENT    </h3>        <p>      On the day of the Big Hoist, my backyard looked something      like Fig. 6. Naturally, I'd cleared the entire area of      brush and debris prior to this critical part of my water      reservoir's construction.    </p>    <p>      Two small saplings-each about six inches in diameter      at the base-were left just at the edge of the      clearing and just behind the spot where the raised tower      would (if everything went right) come to rest. Then I      stretched four or five short lengths of rope between the      two trees to form a kind of "safety net" that'd catch the      upright structure if it overshot its mark.    </p>    <p>      I attached my block and tackle-which consisted of two      double blocks and 200 feet of half-inch rope-to a      spot fifteen feet up on a nearby (and large) tree. From      that attachment point the tackle was extended down and      attached to a rope tied around one of the tower's top sills      (Fig. 6) . . . and the free end of the 200-foot rope was      led from the tree to the trailer hitch on my pickup truck.    </p>    <p>      Had we begun to pull on the rope at this stage, we would've      accomplished little, because the tower (meeting no      resistance at its base) would simply have slid flat along      the ground. Soto give the structure a boost up in the      world-we lifted its top with lever bars and piles of      firewood until the legs on the underneath side of the tower      could "dig in". This done, we were ready to begin hoisting.    </p>    <p>      At last, I signaled my assistant to give the truck some gas      . . . and the tower began to rise slowly into the air. It      continued to rise, until-just short of reaching the      critical balance point beyond which the whole edifice would      tip into place my driver came to the far end of the      clearing and had to stop.    </p>    <p>      The rope was now stretched across the entire yard so I went      over and innocently gave the line a slight sideways tug . .      . then watched in horror as the tower rocked <em>past</em>      vertical . . . over into the safety "net" . . . and back      where it belonged. It then staggered back and forth in      place for a moment and rumbled like far-off thunder      before-finally-coming to rest.    </p>    <h3>      SOME FINISHING TOUCHES    </h3>    <p>      The tower-when it eventually quit dancing      around-landed almost exactly where I wanted it to.      Even so, the four temporary cinder block foundations      <em>did</em> shift slightly, and one leg bounced off its      mount entirely. I was able to pull the structure squarely      onto its four supports once and for all, though, with the      aid of two chains and a come-along.    </p>    <p>      At that point, I still had to secure the 19-plus-foot-tall      structure in place. And I did so by digging some dirt from      around each of the cinder blocks. Then I [1] drilled a hole      horizontally through the base of every leg, [2] pounded a      steel rod through each hole, [3] bent the rod down into the      trench (as shown in Fig. 7), and [4] poured enough concrete      into the dug-away areas to just cover the blocks. After      anchoring each leg individually in this manner, I ended up      with a tower that was permanently fastened to four      separate, independent, and <em>heavy</em> supports.    </p>    <p>      With the tower finally up and secured, I turned my      attention to routing water from the storage tank to my      cabin. This was accomplished by screwing an "ell" and an      adapter into the outlet at the bottom of the steel      reservoir, and then running some plastic pipe (the black      flexible kind) from this fixture to the inside of my      dwelling.    </p>    <p>      I should add that I insulated all aboveground portions of      the pipe. First, by wrapping the exposed conduit in glass      wool and mylar tape (which is available in inexpensive      kits) . . . then, by encasing the whole affair in some      four-inch PVC pipe I happened to have left over from      another project. I finished the job with couplers and PVC      glue on all joints. The plumbing system which resulted was      very solid and has proven to be virtually freeze-proof.    </p>    <p>      Here in the Northern Neck region of Virginia the winters      never get cold enough to cause the entire contents of a      large (375-gallon) water storage vessel to freeze. In more      frigid areas, however, such a container might have to be      protected with some sort of heater . . . such as the kind      sold to prevent stock-watering tanks from icing over. If      you live in the far north, this idea might be worth      checking out.    </p>    <h3>      AND IT WORKS    </h3>    <p>      I'm truly pleased with my new water system. That big      black-and-tan tower not only looks good sitting out on the      edge of my clearing, but it does everything I ever wanted      it to do. Namely, it puts six pounds of static pressure      into my cabin's water pipes . . . which is all the "power"      I need to operate my shower, faucet, and flush tank.    </p>    <p>      At the present time, I fill the steel storage container      with a small, portable, gasoline-driven pump. In the      future, though, I hope to convert to a hydraulic ram pump      that is powered by a nearby stream.    </p>    <p>      Yep, I may be a little bit spoiled, up here in my backwoods      palace, by all the conveniences of 20th century life . . .      but I've <em>got</em> to have running water when I want it,      or else I'm just not happy.    </p>    <p>      These days-needless to say-I'm positively      ecstatic.    </p>
