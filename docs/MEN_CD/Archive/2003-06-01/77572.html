                    <h5 id="byline">      By Nancy Smith and Heidi Hunt<br />  Illustrations by Tom Griffin    </h5>        <p>If rabbits turn your head-whether your fancy runs to      whoppers like the gentle Flemish Giants, to gorgeous and      easygoing Angoras or to the soft and cuddly Mini      Rex-you'll find plenty of these critters for sale, at      reasonable prices, all across the country. And if you      decide to go a-rabbiting, keeping as few as two or three      bunnies lets you tap some of the "green" contributions      these versatile little animals can make to your homestead. </p>    <p>      Domestic rabbits have been contributing companionship,      food, fur and other products to their American      keepers-urban and rural-since about 1900, when      they first were imported from Europe. Today, they are      raised as pets, for meat, pelts and wool, and for medical      research.    </p>    <p>      Whatever their purposes, all rabbits produce a      high-powered, relatively weed-seed-free manure that can be      used to enrich garden plots and raise earthworms, which      also do their part to improve garden soil.    </p>    <p>      If you're looking for yet another use for rabbits that      doesn't involve harvesting them for meat or pelts, some      breeds produce a luxurious wool that can be sheered from      their coats, spun and woven into an exotic yarn.    </p>    <h3>      POPULAR PETS    </h3>    <p>      From childhood, many of us have known bunnies primarily for      their sterling qualities as pets-cuddly, quiet and      inquisitive. Glen Carr, executive secretary of the American      Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA), says his association      recognizes 45 distinct breeds. The most popular for pet      purposes, he says, are the Dutch, Netherland Dwarf, Mini      Rex, Jersey Wooly (an Angora) and Mini-Lop; of those, the      Mini Rex holds the top spot.    </p>    <p>      Gretchen Shoup of Radical Rex Rabbitry in Custer, Michigan,      says she thinks of her Mini Rex as "velveteen" rabbits.      "Their fur feels just like velvet fabric," she says. "The      guard hairs keep the fur upright, which creates a very      dense, springy, soft, slinky feeling when the fur is      compressed."    </p>    <p>      ARBA standards recognize a number of colors for the Mini      Rex, including black, blue, castor, chinchilla, chocolate,      Himalayan, lynx, opal, red, seal, tortoise, white, lilac      and a broken pattern, and breeders are trying continually      to develop new variations. Maximum show weight for this      breed's senior does, which are female rabbits, is a      diminutive 4 1/2 pounds; for bucks, or males, it is just 4      1/4 pounds.    </p>    <p>      Shoup, a junior in art education at Siena Heights      University in Adrian, Michigan, and her younger sister,      Rachel, 17, keep about 40 rabbits. They followed their      brother into the 4-H rabbit project; he kept mixed breeds      while the girls kept standard Rex, but Gretchen switched to      Minis in 2000 and hasn't looked back. Most Mini Rex also      have really good personalities, she says, explaining why      she focuses on selling her rabbits as 4-H projects and      pets. "They're too little to butcher," she says, "and      they're easier for a little kid to carry around." Her own      4-year-old nephew, Preston, regularly helps with the chores      at Radical Rex.    </p>    <p>      Karen Heintz, secretary of the National Mini Rex Rabbit      Club, reports more Mini Rex were shown last year in      competitions and more are owned by youths than any other      breed of rabbit. She says they are a cross between the      standard Rex and the Netherland Dwarf that resulted in a      dwarf rabbit with the gentle personality of the Rex and a      Rex coat, which she described as "carpet-like."    </p>    <p>      Heintz began raising and showing rabbits after her own      daughter enrolled in the 4-H rabbit project in 1988.      Eventually, her daughter grew up-and Heintz became a      licensed ARBA judge. She was the first American invited to      judge a Mini Rex rabbit competition in Japan, and now, she      says, she flies somewhere in the world almost every weekend      to judge a rabbit show.    </p>    <p>      Back home on her Pipestone, Minnesota, farm, all the manure      from Heintz' rabbitry goes on her garden. "I swear by it,"      she says.    </p>    <p>      Shoup's family tends an 80-year-old, 20,000-square-foot      vegetable and flower garden established by her      greatgrandparents on the family's Michigan farm, and every      bit of manure the rabbits produce goes on that plot, too.    </p>    <p>      Frank Zaloudek of Horn Rapids Rabbitry in West Richland,      Washington, keeps Mini Rex, Belgian Hares and Flemish      Giants-but he's fondest of the latter two. For      Zaloudek, a retired research<br />      scientist who took up rabbit keeping as a hobby 15 years      ago, it was love at first sight with the gentle Flemish      Giants, which often weigh in at 20 or more pounds. "I      walked into the local Red Mountain Feed Store to buy cattle      feed," he re calls, "and they had two Flemish Giant rabbits      for sale. I thought they were so extraordinary I bought      them on the spot. I love those guys."    </p>    <p>      Belgian Hares, which date to the early 1700s in Europe, are      a very historic breed in the United States, having launched      domestic rabbit keeping here with their arrival in 1888.      The breed's early promoters exhibited the rabbits at small      stock shows across the country, successfully popularizing      them. For a time, large numbers were imported at fabulous      prices-as much as $1,000 each at a time when laborers      were paid 10  cents an hour-creating what now is      called the "Belgian Hare boom."    </p>    <p>      Today, Zaloudek, who is secretary-treasurer of the Belgian      Hare Breeders Club, says only about 400 of the animals      exist in the United States-but their popularity is on      the rise again, especially along the East Coast.    </p>    <p>      These rabbits are tricky to breed, he says, but the      challenge of such a difficult task and the beauty and grace      of the animals, which will "prance in their cages in a      fashion that can only be described as an animal      ballet-not a flat-footed rabbit hop," appeal to      fanciers. With handling, he says, they make good pets, too.    </p>            <h3>      MEAT AND MANURE    </h3>    <p>      Backyard rabbitries also may provide meat for a family.      Rabbit breeds developed specifically for meat include Giant      Chinchilla, Californian and the New Zealand.    </p>    <p>      Zaloudek regularly culls from his Mini Rex, Belgian Hare      and Flemish Giant herds, too. He and his wife butcher the      animals themselves and take them to a local butcher, who      mixes the rabbit meat with herbs and pork (for fat) to make      a tasty rabbit sausage the couple enjoys. Zaloudek says his      practical motto is "Show the best and eat the rest."    </p>    <p>      If there's a rabbit around your house (or yard), it will      reliably produce about a pound of dry manure a week, or 50      pounds in a year. With minimal effort, the rabbit's output      can be turned into garden "black gold." George Dickerson,      extension horticulture specialist in New Mexico, describes      rabbit manure as a "high quality" soil conditioner that is      often low in weed seeds because rabbits usually are fed      prepared foods. The average nutrient content for dry manure      is rated at 2.4 percent nitrogen (N), 1.4 percent      phosphorus (P) and 0.6 percent potassium (K). Fresh, it is      higher in nitrogen than chicken, cow, horse, pig, sheep or      goat manures; dry, it remains higher than cow, horse and      goat manures.    </p>    <p>      Less likely to burn plants than some other manures, rabbit      manure is particularly well-suited to plants that require      heavy feeding. Davis' husband, Bill, swears by it for      azaleas; others favor it for roses.    </p>    <p>      Dickerson suggests incorporating the manure directly into      the soil in the fall or combining it first with other      organic materials in a compost pile. A minimum of three      weeks of composting is recommended. Spread the composted      material on the produce garden or top-dress ornamental      plants with fresh manure.    </p>    <p>      Dickerson also recommends starting a worm farm under the      rabbit cages, using red wigglers (Eisenia fetida) from bait      stores. "Then," he says, "you will have a source of good      manure, worm castings and a source of compost worms for      other compost sites in your landscape." (In cold winters,      red wigglers may die out; just replace them in the spring.)    </p>    <p>      Raising earthworms in beds underneath the rabbit cages also      helps ensure odor control in the rabbitry and regular      visits from fishing friends, who'll love using those plump,      juicy worms for bait.    </p>        <h3>      SILKY, WAVY WOOL    </h3>    <p>      Seven years ago, spinner and weaver Linda Davis of      Richlands, North Carolina, saw her chance at a barnful of      Angora wool "on the hoof" when her son Sean first entered      4-H. His club's focus was on animal science, and he wanted      to enroll in the rabbit project, too. His mother reasoned      that he might as well buy Angoras so they'd have wool as      well as rabbits. "It was a very good choice," she says      today. "Once we got the rabbits home, I fell in love with      them. They're so sweet and loveable, and so much fun to      have around the house. I just enjoy their companionship."      And Sean, now 14, has done well with his rabbits nationally      in 4-H, earning a spot in the National 4-H Congress, and      winning top prizes in national rabbit breed competitions,      too. "You have to be dedicated," Sean says of taking on the      responsibility of caring for rabbits-whether it's a      single animal or a barnful. "It's a lot of work, but in the      long run, it's worth it," he says.    </p>    <p>      Susan Rutz of Topeka, Kansas, agrees. For many years, she      and her husband kept rabbits for their foster children to      care for while living in their home. "When new foster      children arrived, we showed them their rooms and the      bathroom, and then led them straight to the back yard and      the rabbits. Each child was assigned a rabbit to care for      and given instructions for the daily cleaning of the cage      and the animal's feeding routine."    </p>    <p>      One of the foster children in particular excelled with the      rabbits, she says. "He would spend hours brushing the      rabbits and caring for them, the entire time talking to      them about the personal details of his life that he was not      comfortable sharing with anyone else. He became the      neighborhood expert in the proper care of rabbits, and he      found his permanent home with us."    </p>    <p>      Zaloudek also has seen a rabbit's emotional healing power      firsthand. He and his wife use their Flemish Giants and      Mini Rex for pet therapy at a local nursing home. "My wife      put a rabbit on the chest of a person in a coma and thought      to be a vegetable. She took the person's hand and placed it      on the rabbit, and he smiled. That was the most      heart-warming thing we have ever seen."    </p>    <p>      Whether a pet-therapy animal or just a pet, beloved bunnies      often are kept indoors like a house cat, trained to use a      litter box, and spayed or neutered according to their sex.      Davis says they make wonderful house pets but need a      comfortable and secure cage or hutch to stay in when no one      is home - to protect them from themselves. Bunnies enjoy      chewing on a variety of things, and electrical cords      present a particular hazard.    </p>    <p>      "Rabbits are cute, but they need responsible care," Davis      says. "Be prepared to give a lot of love and a lot of      care."    </p>    <h3>      Resources    </h3>    <p>      For more information on buying and raising rabbits, contact      the American Rabbit Breeders Association, Inc.; P.O.
