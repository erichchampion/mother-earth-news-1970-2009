        <p class="caption">Unlike rigid piping that uses a straight-line network of pipes to deliver water to appliances and fixtures, PEX delivers constant pressure to all fixtures by directing water in one central tube to a hub, where water is then equally distributed in half-inch lines throughout the house.</p>
