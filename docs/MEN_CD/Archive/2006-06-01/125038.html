        Rather than planting your garden in traditional rows, many expertsrecommend planting crops in wide permanent beds. By using the sameareas for beds and paths each year, you can save on fertilizer andtilling time. Plus, you'll be able to keep soil loose more easilythan if you use new rows each year, with some rows ending up inareas where soil is compacted from having been a path the yearbefore.<br /><br />The permanent beds can be raised (to improve drainage and warm upfaster in spring), or they can be slightly sunken (to conservemoisture and protect seedlings in dry, windy climates). You canframe them with wood, bricks or logs, or leave them unframed. Theimportant point is to designate the beds and paths and follow thesame pattern from year to year.<br /><br /><b>When sowing seeds in the garden,</b> it can be difficult not tocrowd your future edible plants. That's the reason most of us spenda great deal of time thinning seedlings each spring. It's also thereason that those of us who can't find the time to do the thinningend up having tightly spaced plants that look a mess and don't haveenough room to grow.<br /><br /><b>When sowing your seeds into wide beds,</b> here's a tip thatwill help you space seeds evenly, reduce the time you spendthinning young plants and make it easier to spot weeds:<br /><br />Lay a piece of chicken wire over the bed as a guide. The hexagonalopenings in the wire are spaced on either one inch or two inchcenters, and your seed packet will tell you how far apart seeds ofeach crop should be spaced.<br /><br />The loose, fertile soil in your permanent beds and your chickenwire sowing guide will put you well on your way to having thebest-looking garden in the neighborhood.
