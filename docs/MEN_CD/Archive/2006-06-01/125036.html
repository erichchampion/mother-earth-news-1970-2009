        Small vegetable garden spaces can be expanded to grow more producewith the use of a trellis system, which is great for many kinds ofvining vegetables.<br /><br />Pole beans, of course, work on a trellis, but have you triedcucumbers? On a trellis, cucumbers grow long and straight and leavea lot more ground for other plantings. A strong trellis also can beused for some small melon varieties. The melons will maintain theirnaturally round shape, and keeping them off the ground discouragesrot and keeps some critters at bay. Heavy tomato vines also can betrained to grow along a trellis.<br /><br />Place your trellises in garden areas where they will receive amplesunlight, but not where the trellises will shade your otherplants.<br /><br />To make a trellis, a heavy gauge of fencing material works best. Mytrellises are just over 6 feet high, with the bottom of the fencingattached 1 foot up on the metal fence stakes.<br />
