                    <p>      <strong>H</strong>omo sapiens is a remarkable species. Maybe we should take      a moment, now and then, to appreciate just how unusual we      are.    </p>    <p>      Generally, the Earth’s plants and animals are      concerned only with propagating their own kind. Natural      controls-predators, disease,      starvation-keep things in balance. But humans seem      different in two important ways.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        There’s no other species that considers its impact        on the environment.      </p>    </div>    <p>      First, thus far we have been highly successful at fending      off those natural population controls. As a result, we      enjoy the unprecedented benefits of civilization. At the      same time, though, the world’s human population is      growing rapidly.    </p>    <p>      Second, many of us have noticed that current human      activities are threatening other species and the      Earth’s natural systems. There’s no other      species-as far as we know-that considers      its impact on the environment. Given that we seem to be the      only species that has developed this ability, maybe we      shouldn’t be too surprised that we’re having a      tough time getting the hang of it.    </p>    <p>      The survival of an individual bear or a sparrow has no      direct relationship to the health and welfare of human      beings. There may or may not be an indirect connection. Yet      many of us are concerned for bears and sparrows not only as      abstract symbols of environmental health, but because they      are important to us personally. We put pictures of them on      our walls and name places for them. We want to save      threatened animals not just to maintain biological balance;      we take a personal interest in the health and welfare of      our fellow earthlings. Crowds flock to beaches to help save      stranded whales. Birdwatchers congregate along the      world’s flyways to witness the beauty of birds and      their migrations. Tourists flock to Yellowstone National      Park in droves to observe the reintroduced gray wolves.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        We are pleased to announce a new department featuring        reviews and ratings of green products by the renowned        Consumer Reports magazine.      </p>    </div>    <p>      Humankind has understood the value of biological diversity      for a long time. Judeo-Christian doctrine supports the      concept in the story of Noah and his ark of animals. Jesus      said God notices every sparrow that falls. Buddhist, Muslim      and Hindu sages have advocated concern for all creatures      from the earliest days of those faiths.    </p>    <p>      It’s tempting, of course, to dwell on our human      failures. We haven’t risen to the challenge of our      best intentions. We’re still allowing our population      to skyrocket, still driving other species to extinction and      still degrading the environment.    </p>    <p>      And we may ultimately fail to achieve our potential. We may      spoil our own nest?- damage our environment so      severely that it can no longer support us. Then we may      precipitate our own extinction, becoming victims of our own      success.    </p>    <p>      But isn’t it miraculous that we can even consider all      this? That we are conscious of the negative consequences of      our prosperity? And that we care enough about our fellow      creatures to debate the actions we should take to assure      our collective survival in the future? This, if nothing      else, should give us reason for hope.    </p>    <p>      -Mother    </p>
