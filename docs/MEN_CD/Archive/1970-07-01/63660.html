                <p>      Just like light shows and sideburns, the co-op idea is      spreading from the alternate culture into straight society.      Lynn Sherr reported on the trend in a recent Associated      Press story:    </p>        <p>      "There's a grocery 'store' in a Brooklyn garage which      scrimps on brown bags, charges two  cents each for egg      cartons and sells top quality sirloin for 98  cents a pound.    </p>    <p>      "At the chain supermarket three blocks away, brown bags and      egg cartons are free, but sirloin costs $1.49 a pound.    </p>    <p>      "The 'store' is the Cuyler-Warren Consumer Buying Club - a      food cooperative in a racially mixed area where shoppers      claim to save up to 30 per cent a week on meat, eggs, fruit      and vegetables."    </p>    <p>      The syndicated article goes on to say that New York Mayor      John Lindsay's Commission on Inflation and Economic Welfare      has praised the C-W co-op and recommended that the city      encourage and assist similar food buying clubs.    </p>    <p>      Five housewives, under the direction of Mrs. Kittie Brown,      organized the C-W co-op over a year ago in Gowanus, a      hardcore poverty section of Brooklyn.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Brown says, "I didn't know how bad conditions were in      our neighborhood until, 1968, when I found some      mangy-looking fruit surrounded by green flies in a local      store. Then a friend and I discovered the wholesale food      markets and bought a basket of really good tomatoes for a      fraction of the neighborhood grocery's price. That did it!      Five of us put up $5 each and, with the original $25,      started buying and reselling peaches, stringbeans and      tomatoes."    </p>    <p>      The co-op originally weighed all produce on a set of      bathroom scales and sold it at night in a church kitchen.      Now the garage store is open all day Friday and serves 67      members and a number of non-members who are permitted to      shop without paying the co-op fee.    </p>    <p>      The C-W operation is pretty typical for a food co-op.      Anyone who wants to purchase must fill out an order blank      and turn it in by 5 p.m. Wednesday. On Thursday, members of      the co-op staff tally up quantities and place bulk orders      for meat with a wholesale butcher for Friday delivery.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Brown and a volunteer or two usually buy all fruits      and vegetables from one of New York's wholesale produce      markets at 6 a.m. on Friday morning. The purchases are      hauled back to Brooklyn in a faded green station wagon.    </p>    <p>      By 9:30 a.m. all the food is neatly stacked along the walls      of the former garage. At 10, the doors are opened and      black, white and Puerto Rican housewives begin wandering in      to pick up their orders . . . and, maybe, something extra.      The co-op makes it a practice to purchase more than the      total of Wednesday's orders: The dewy freshness and low      prices of CW's produce almost always guarantee a sell-out.    </p>    <p>      A recent comparison of C-W and local supermarket prices is      quite interesting: At the co-op extra large eggs were 69       cents a dozen; lettuce, 25  cents a head; yams, 2 for 29       cents; tomatoes, 30  cents a pound. Three blocks away, the      chain store was charging 89  cents a dozen for jumbo eggs,      35  cents a head for lettuce, 19  cents each for yams and      tomatoes had a price of 49  cents a pound.    </p>    <p>      Price alone does not tell the whole story, however. Quality      is just as important. Mrs. Brown says, "What we really want      is good quality food at a price people can afford. And our      quality can't be beat."<br />    </p>
