                    <h5 id="byline">by BRIAN N. MARI</h5>    <p>      Reprinted with permission of MOTORHOME LIFE    </p>        <p>      A studio motorhome started its travels from Selby, North      Dakota, with artist Don Dyson, a landscape painter, at the      wheel. Mrs. Dyson and seven children, ranging in age from 9      to 17, accompanied him, in the converted Oneida bus. The      66-passenger bus was purchased in Superior, Wisconsin, and      remodeled by the Dysons. Don needed changes of scenes for      his work; the rest of the family was delighted to go along.    </p>    <p>      As a roving artist, Don soon found sales coming from fellow      travelers on the road. Neighbors in overnight campgrounds      or at scenic highway pullouts invariably seemed to be      attracted by the sight of a painter at work. When they      discovered they could buy an original showing the view      where they had stayed or stopped, many ordered a painting      on the spot.    </p>    <p>      Don works at top speed, can turn out a 2x4-foot panel in 30      minutes or less. While his customer watches, or takes time      out for a cup of coffee, Don can have. a <em>land</em> - or      <em>seascape</em> ready for framing. He can also create a      mural in any blank space in a customer's RecV.*    </p>        <p>      When the Dysons pulled up their North Dakota stakes, they      had no idea that business would develop among RecV      enthusiasts like themselves. They found that most areas      required no city or county licenses for this type of      enterprise, thus the only expense was cost of materials.      Today Don works any hours he chooses, never has to dress up      to impress his prospects. Anyone who wants a painting makes      up has mind quickly since both he and the artist are on the      move. Don's prices reflect his low overhead and most      potential customers jump at this unique opportunity to own      an "original Dyson."    </p>    <p>      Fifteen years of RecV experience in other types of rigs      gave the Dyson family a working background for becoming      full time motorhomers. Mrs. Dyson mastered both living in      and driving the 12-ton, 10-shift bus. When this "studio"      moves to a new location, the kids enjoy changing schools.      However, they have more fun during vacation periods when      there are no restrictions on the Dysons' roaming instincts.      Special expenses relating to the motorhome have proved      surprisingly low. Insurance premiums have been comparable      to average car coverage while the license for a North      Dakota "housecar" is only $19.70 a year. Don works on the      theory of preventive maintenance through regular servicing      and this has kept repairs to a minimum.    </p>    <p>      As far as 53-year old Don Dyson is concerned, there are      emphatically no drawbacks to being an itinerant painter -      if you have a motorhome for a studio and room to take the      family along.    </p>    <p>      * RecV = Recreational Value    </p>
