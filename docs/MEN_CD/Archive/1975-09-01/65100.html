                    <h5 id="byline">      by WAYNE B. ANDERSON    </h5>    <p>      Although I hate to be pessimistic about a good idea, I must      offer some cautionary feedback on B. R. Saubolle's article      "How to Make and Use a Sawdust Stove" (MOTHER NO. 30). In      particular, I want to amplify a warning by the author that      the stove "does give off some fumes" and that the room      where it's in use "must be well ventilated". Very true . .      . but the statement isn't definite enough or strong enough.      Combustion in such a device might easily be incomplete,      and-instead of giving off only carbon dioxide and      water vapor, the gases normally associated with      burning-the smoldering fuel might also produce carbon      monoxide and hydrocarbon vapors.    </p>    <p>      The problem is that the combustion process isn't as simple      as it might seem, particularly where wood wastes or other      complex hydrocarbon mixtures are concerned. For complete      burning, each molecule of such a substance must be broken      up (eventually into its elements . . . carbon, hydrogen,      sometimes oxygen, and others) and gasified (solids and      liquids don't burn, but the gases formed from them at      elevated temperatures do). If gasification occurs before      the total breakdown of the particles, less complex      hydrocarbon molecules may be given off as vapors. Or, if      the original units do break up completely but don't contact      sufficient oxygen to be fully oxidized, carbon (soot)      and/or carbon monoxide may be produced.    </p>    <p>      Both soot and hydrocarbon compounds are usually detectable      immediately, either by sight (black smoke) or smell      (solvent-like odors). Carbon monoxide, however, is odorless      and invisible.    </p>    <p>      The dangers of these incomplete combustion products vary.      Soot is primarily a source of grime, but could cause      respiratory problems over long periods. (Once inhaled, the      minute carbon particles are deposited deep within the lungs      and will not be expelled by breathing.)    </p>    <p>      Hydrocarbon vapors will cause various problems depending on      what specific compounds are present. If any organic acids      or aldehydes are produced skin, eye, and respiratory      irritation would be likely.    </p>    <p>      The real killer, though, is carbon monoxide. This substance      has an affinity for the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the      blood which is some 210 times that of oxygen itself . . .      and its absorption through respiration therefore prevents      proper oxygen intake. Over long periods of continuous      exposure, more and more hemoglobin is "tied up" until the      bloodstream can no longer carry sufficient oxygen to      sustain life.    </p>    <p>      There's really no way to determine the degree of incomplete      combustion-and corresponding danger-in a stove      such as the one described in the article. The device must      certainly be used with adequate ventilation, as the author      stated, but this might make it ineffective as a heat      source. At any rate, it would seem inadvisable to use the      non-vented heater in a sickroom or other area in which the      occupants are sleeping or incapacitated (I'm thinking      especially of babies and elderly persons). If combustion      were poor, one average night's rest could turn into an      eternity.<br />    </p>    <p>      The larger models of the stove appear safer, since a flue      would likely be used to vent any fumes. Nevertheless,      anyone who uses either this or the smaller heater for long      periods should immediately seek fresh air-preferably      outdoors-if headache or dizziness develops.    </p>    <p>      In case you're wondering, I'm by no means an expert on      combustion. As a chemical engineer now working for a      government agency on air pollution control, however, I'm      often concerned with incineration and with the use of wood      waste as fuel . . . and I must emphasize one point:      Although various efforts have been made to control air      pollution from the burning of wood by controlling the      combustion process, such operations have proven very      tricky. With many types of combustion devices it's possible      to reduce the amount of smoke produced, but not the amount      of carbon monoxide. Deaths from poisoning by this deadly      gas have resulted in the past from the use of charcoal as      an indoor fuel . . . and the principle of the sawdust stove      is very similar. I offer these comments in the hope of      preventing MOTHER's readers from injuring themselves.    </p>    <p>      Although I have my doubts about the sawdust stove in the      form described, I thank B. R. Saubolle for sharing his      knowledge.    </p>
