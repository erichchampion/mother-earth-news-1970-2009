        <p>Repeat after me: “Nothing is too small to make a difference.” That’s the mantra of Wanda Urbanska, who shows us that there are many ways to simplify life in her PBS television series, <a title="Simple Living with Wanda Urbanska" href="http://www.simplelivingtv.net/" target="_blank"><em>Simple Living with Wanda Urbanska</em></a>. Now in its fourth season, <em>Simple Living</em> offers ideas to help viewers eliminate the clutter that consumes our 21st century lives. The half-hour segments produced by Urbanska and her partner, writer Frank Levering, focus on four themes: environmental stewardship, thoughtful consumption, community involvement and financial responsibility. This season, keep an eye out for segments about wiser living featuring <em><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></em> Editor in Chief Cheryl Long, as well as a few colleagues from our sister publications, <em>Grit</em> and <em>Herb Companion</em>. Watch for <em>Simple Living</em> on your local PBS station schedule (locate your station <a title="here" href="http://www.pbs.org/stationfinder/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
