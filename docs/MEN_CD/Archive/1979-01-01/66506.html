                <h5 id="byline">by       RICHARD VARENCHIK    </h5>		<hr />    <p>      Do you have a product or service you need to sell?    </p>    		<hr />	                    <p>      The editor of your local newspaper wants desperately to      give you free advertising. In fact, he or she would be      <em>overjoyed</em> to print information about the crafts      you make . . . the food you sell at your homestead ... the      business you operate ... or the service you perform.<br />      <br />      There are, however, a few tricks that you'll have to know      ... in order to make that editor <em>realize</em> how much      he wants to "promote" your home enterprise. And, since I've      been in the newspaper game for eight years, I can tell you      all about these gimmicks.<br />      <br />      First, you must understand the "Golden Rule" of most      newspaper owners: "Spend not! " Practically speaking, this      translates: "Why hire two reporters when one can be made to      do the work of two ... or three?" And this philosophy holds      true for all but the largest,. most prestigious papers in      the country.<br />      <br />      As a result of this "rule", the editors of almost all small      and medium-sized papers-the kind that probably serve your      community--find themselves chronically understaffed and      continually overworked ... and <em>their</em> problems can      help you get <em>your</em> story into print. The paper      needs news week after week to fill its columns, so you'll      delight your local editor if you come in and hand him or      her a free story that he or she can pop right into one of      those empty spaces.<br />      <br />      Your story won't be "hard news" (such as a bank robbery or      an auto accident). Rather, it will be what journalists call      a "feature". And editors of small papers are always on the      lookout for good features: a man who makes wooden toys ...      a rockhound who fashions jewelry from the stones he      collects ... a catfish farm ... a candlemaker ... a man who      welds metal scraps into "art" objects ... a man who makes      furniture from scrap lumber or wooden burls ... a "u-pick"      cherry orchard, and so on.<br />      <br />      I know that each of those subjects would make a good      feature, because I've written stories on all of them. Try      writing one about yourself, and - if it appeals to the      paper's editor you'll get free advertising.<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>      A SIMPLE KEY    </h3>    <p>      The key to a good feature is the lead ... those first few      lines that set the tone of the story. A harried editor will      quickly hurl your literary gem Into the trash if the first      paragraph is dull. On the other hand, a good lead will      probably get an otherwise routine story into the paper (or      at least bring you some suggestions on how to improve      It).<br />      <br />      So what makes a good lead? Well, for an example, let's      consider the one I wrote on the "u-pick" cherry orchard. I      could have pounded out something like:<br />      <br />      "Newhall residents can save money by picking their own      cherries at Rex's 'U-Pick' Cherry Orchard." But my boss      would have thrown the story right back at me, because, one,      It's dull, and two, It might offend local market owners who      pay the paper for their advertising.<br />      <br />      The lead I finally wrote for the cherry story went like      this:<br />      <br />      "It's that time of year, and people are picking on Rex      again. Children pick on him. Adults pick on him. Busloads      of senior citizens drive all the way to Rex's orchard just      to pick on him. But Rex doesn't mind. In fact, he loves It,      because ...<br />      <br />      It didn't win me a Pulitzer Prize, but It did make my      editor chuckle. (You know you've accomplished something      when your story prods any emotion out of a hardened      newspaper editor.)<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>      OTHER SAMPLE LEADS    </h3>    <p>      When I wrote the rockhound story, I might have started out      with something about how Joe Smith had turned his hobby      into a profitable small business. That would have been an      okay lead, but it wouldn't actually have reached out and      grabbed anyone. So, I started the story this way:<br />      <br />      "In ancient times, the alchemists searched in vain for the      secret of turning lead into gold. Joe Smith of Saugus has      done the ancient magicians one better. He turns rocks into      money.<br />      <br />      " Are you getting the Idea? All you do is take a relatively      commonplace topic and write about It in a snappy,      interesting way. In fact, even a very routine business may      hide a seed that could sprout into a good feature. The      article that I wrote about a welder is an example:<br />      <br />      "Jack Jones earned $2,000 a month at City Hospital. He had      a big house, lots of bills, and an ulcer. Now Jones is      broke, lives on a small farm in Saugus, and smiles most of      the time.<br />      <br />      " It's not the fact that Jack is a welder that makes that      lead interesting ... It's the fact that he left a big-money      job to get back to the land. If It were changed a little,      that introduction could begin stories about many of      MOTHER's readers.<br />      <br />      Once you've got a good lead, the rest of the piece won't be      too difficult. In the case of Jack-the-Welder,<br />      <br />      I told a little about the life he hated in the city ... the      last straw that convinced him to make the move ... and the      problems that he faces in his new life.<br />      <br />      The "new life" part of the piece is a perfect place to work      in information about how Jack welds for low prices or even      for barter. Don't get technical. Remember, <em>your story      must not sound like an advertisement.</em> People would      much rather know about the time you almost burned your      house down melting wax than read all the steps it takes to      make a candle.<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>      SHORT AND NEAT    </h3>    <p>      If you check your local paper for their story style, you'll      probably find short paragraphs made up of basic,      easy-to-understand sentences. Keeping that in mind, type up      your manuscript (handwritten stories are almost sure to be      rejected) and limit It to <em>no more</em> than three or      four pages.<br />      <br />      Start typing about halfway down the first page to leave      room for a headline (which the editor will write).      Double-space your lines and be sure to double-check all of      your facts and spellings. A neat, typed, error-free      manuscript will save the editor's time and eyes ... and      cause him or her to smile upon your literary      offering.<br />    </p>    <h3>      PHOTOS SELL    </h3>    <p>      Aside from submitting a bright, interesting story, there's      one other thing you can do to win a place on The Front      Page: Supply the editor with some good black-and-white (no      color) photographs that will illustrate your piece. Good      photos can even help sell a marginal story and are sure to      give any article a better chance of reaching print.<br />      <br />      The easiest way to supply pictures is to shoot (or have a      friend shoot) a whole roll of film (usually 35mm) and then      turn it In undeveloped. The paper will have access to a      darkroom.<br />      <br />      It's even better if you develop the film yourself and make      8" X 10" glossy prints from your two or three best shots.      Be sure, however, that the pictures show something other      than you grinning into the camera lens. They must be sharp      and clear and should always illustrate whatever the story      says you do. If you make cornhusk dolls, for example, be at      work on one in the photo ... with several others completed      and scattered around your work area. A candlemaker could      perhaps pour wax Into a mold in front of a display of      finished candles.<br />      <br />    </p>    <h3>      YOU'RE DEAD AT DEADLINE    </h3>		<p>Time your submission properly. Remember those old movies    where the kid reporter ran into the newspaper office and    shouted "stop the presses"? Forget it! It probably never    happened.<br />    <br />    The quickest way to get thrown out on your tail Is to try to    see a newspaper editor at deadline ... those frantic hours    just before the paper goes to press.<br />    <br />    In fact, It pays to find out when your local paper's deadline    occurs, and then go In <em>after</em> that to see the person-    in- charge. The editor will then have time to look at your    article and tell you what changes (if any) to make.<br />    <br />    So get to work. The local paper needs your story ... and you    can always use the free advertising!</p>
