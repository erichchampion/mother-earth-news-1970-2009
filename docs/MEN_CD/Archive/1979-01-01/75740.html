                <p><strong>      COUNTRY LORE    </strong></p>		<hr />      			<hr />      <p>      Cheryl Matthews of Sandy Hollow, Pennsylvania writes that      her family was gettin' pretty tired of the stripped-down      Volkswagen that sat on blocks In their back yard ... until      the Matthews family got a good deal on 20 chickens! After      the addition of a low roosting poles, several nest boxes,      and an "access" ladder, the chickens settled right Into the      beat-up bootie. Not only that, but Cheryl's birds seem to      like their two-door coop. And, at night-with the car's      windows rolled most of the way up-the "poult's wagon" is      water- and varmint-proof!<br />      <br />      Television regularly advertises cures for every cosmetic      problem Imaginable (and some that are a little hard to      imagine), but these "beauty aids" are expensive, sometimes      Ineffective, and occasionally even harmful to skin and      hair. So, the next time your flowing locks look "dry and      lifeless", take a tip from Pamela More of Bridge. port,      West Virginia and go to the grocery store for your      solution. Pam says that a small application of olive oil      Oust enough to make a little oily spot on your hand) will      make drab or dull hair shiny and easier to style. Simply      rub the liquid In well, either after or between shampoos      ... not too much, though, or you might be mistaken for a      salad bar!<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      Wasps can be a nuisance when they decide to build their      nests too near the house ... especially If you (or a member      of your family) are allergic to their stings. But Stillman      Valley, Illinois resident Joe B. Russian has found a way to      got rid of the posts without getting "bit". Joe just ties      an oil-soaked rag to a stick, and then embeds the bass of      the homemade "torch" In the ground ... between 10 and 20      feet from the nest. Then, on a dark night, he lights the      rag and-with another stick-knocks the nest down. The      Insects will see the flickering flame when they come      buzzin' out, fly Into It, and "go up In smoke".!<br />      <br />      Gary Anderson of Portland, Oregon come up with an Ingenious      "recycled" use for old umbrella handles. He just attaches      two of 'am (hooks down) to a foot-long scrap of two-by-      four, paints the rig black, and has a dandy hanger for his      garden hose!<br />      <br />      When your car, tractor, or truck has a dead battery and-for      one reason or another-the jumper cables won't reach to      another car, you'll want to thank Patrick Burgess of      Carbondale, Illinois for this tip: Just clip your two      cables together, and use this "extension" as the "positive"      hookup. But, before attaching the jumper, move the running      car so that Its bumper Is touching, metal to metal, the      bumper of the dead car. This will successfully complete the      "negative" connection (you might have to wedge a      screwdriver or something between the two bumpers to get a      good contact). With that done, connect the double-length      "positive" cable and start 'er up!    </p>        <p>      With the popularity of throwaway tissues, not many folks      carry the old-fashioned, handy, cloth handkerchiefs anymore      ... but Los Angeleno Timothy Hall reminds us that this item      (or a neckerchief) can be put to a lot more uses than      wiping a runny nose! Consider the potential of a sturdy      bandanna as mouth protection from smoke, wind, or smog ...      as an emergency bandage or tourniquet ... as a signal, a      potholder, a headband, a belt (if you tie two together), a      carrying pouch (bindlestiff style, with the four corners      knotted), or-torn into strips-an emergency cord or binding.      The lowly hanky can also serve as napkin or towel, filter      your coffee, protect you from sunburn/heatstroke, defog      your windshield, or patch-in a pinch -your jeans!<br />      <br />      Charles J. Cook of Pennsburg, Pennsylvania says he first      read-in the Healthview News Letterthat cayenne popper Is      effective In stopping the flow of blood from wounds. The      article cited an Instance of a man with a gunshot wound in      the stomach who had swallowed a cup of cayenne tea. When      they got the victim to surgery the hospital folks couldn't      believe the clean, almost blood-free condition of the      Injury.<br />      <br />      A few days after the story caught his attention, Charles      found occasion to test the remedy himself when he stabbed      the side of his thumb with a screwdriver. He promptly      "seasoned" the cut with some cayenne ... and the result?      "it stung some," reports Chuck, "but the blooding stopped      Immediately and didn't start again, even when I applied      working pressure on the thumb!"<br />      <br />      Most everyone-sooner or later-has a run-in with warts. The      ugly little growths are certainly a nuisance, and can be      pretty danged uncomfortable to boot. Even worse, often, are      the treatments prescribed to handle this problem, which are      often painful and not always effective. But cheer up,      because reader John T. Lauderdale of Westville, Indiana has      found a simple, down-home wart cure! John says that all you      have to do Is dab the sticky juice from a milkweed (genus      Asclepias) plant on the affected area two or three times a      day ... and after three to five days of this treatment-no      more warts!<br />      <br />      And If milkweed doesn't do the trick on warts, David      Thompson of McClean, Virginia claims that you can apply      nail polish to the stubborn growths twice a day (each time      peeling off the old coat) to make your skin lump-free      within four weeks. Don't miss an application, though -warns      Dave-or the little critters will rejuvenate! against the      north winds of Munger, Michigan. Waldo simply covers the      insides of her windows (those that aren't often used for      lookin') with "bubbled" plastic packing material. Those      little trapped-air pockets make effective Insulators, and      the material Is translucent, so Walda's family still gets      plenty of sunshine.    </p>    <p>      <em>Retread your</em> pj's? If they've got feet In 'am ...      why not? Those cozy children's "feet" pajamas are great for      keeping the little ones warm on cold winter nights.      Unfortunately, however, the lower extremities are usually      the first to be worn out or outgrown ... while the rest of      the sleeper remains in perfectly good condition!    </p>    <p>      But Kay Zorn of Willow Springs, Missouri has solved this      problem: She takes all of her youngsters' unusable      "feeties" and replaces them with "retreads". "Just cut off      the feet and sew In a pair of heavy socks a few sizes      larger than what your child is currently wearing," says      Kay, ". .. It's the best way I know of to add miles to your      young'uns' sleepwearl"</p>		<p>		The next time you're whipping something up on the home    sewing machine and you have one of those long, narrow casings    or ties to turn Inside out, try the method that Barbara    Robertson (Fort Plain, Now York) has figured out. Cut a piece    of cord or strong thread (maybe dental floss?) a handhold    longer than your casing. Sew one end of It to the right side    of the narrow end of your strip of fabric. Lay the strand    along the center of the material, then fold the thing    wrong-side out, just the way the pattern says, and stitch the    long edges together. (Be careful, now, not to sew Into the    cord.) Next, get a good grip on the loose end of the twine    and pull slowly with one hand while you work the cloth back    with the other. Presto! In a few seconds your textile tube Is    right-side out! Then you can just clip away the    "puller-thread" and get on with the next step In your    garment's construction.</p>    <p>      Snake problems, you say') Well, Day Brown of Leslie,      Arkansas just may be able to give you a hand.    </p>    <p>      "Last year we had a predator problem with our nesting      goose," Day writes. "A king snake began to food on her eggs      ... but we caught the critter and moved him to our      homestead's lower forty. Soon, however, we began to suspect      that the thief had returned ... though we couldn't seem to      catch him In the act again."    </p>        <p>      So Day came up with an Idea: He poked a hole In each of a      couple of chicken eggs, blow out the contents, filled the      hen fruit with common table salt, taped up the openings,      and left the deceptive eggshells In a strategic location.      Day figured that if-by chance-it was one of the family dogs      who was stooling the goose eggs, the hound would break the      shell ... find the salt ... and go away unharmed. It,      however, the robber was-in fact-the suspected snake, the      scoundrel would Ingest the contents of the egg. shell ...      be unable to expel It ... and consequently die.    </p>    <p>      Heat loss around windows can have a lot to And so It      happened: Shortly after the trap was do with skyrocketing      heat bills, but Waldo Juhl set the family pup, Herbie, let      It be known "loud has found a solution that's even      effective and clear" that he was not to blame, as he barked      the discovery of a salt-filled snake carcass under the      house ... stopped In its path by the counterfeit hen fruit!    </p>    <p>      Plastic, which becomes amazingly Indestructible when you      want to get rid of It, seems just as amazingly prone to      cracking, crazing, and otherwise springin' leaks when      formed Into buckets, dishpans, and other utensils. Well,      Annis Ferguson out In DuBois, Indiana can save you the trip      to town for a replacement the next time that happens to      you. Heat the blade of an old table knifeAnnis keeps one      handy just for this repair job-and lightly rub the tool's      flat side back and forth over the break. You may have to      reheat the knife a few times and repeat the rubbing more      than once ... but, done properly, this repair work can      stretch a lot more service out of any leaking plastic      container.    </p>        <p>      On those occasions when there's wash to be done and no way      to got to the coin laundry (or the old wringer Is      temporarily out of commission), take a tip from Gall Rush      of Kamuela, Hawaii. Gall gets her young'uns Into the act by      filling the bathtub with water, soap, and clothes, and then      turning the children loose to jump and stomp around to      their hearts' content.    </p>    <p>      And, If you usually have trouble gotten' your little ones      to pitch In with the chores, this Is one job that they'll      surely accept gladly ... In fact, you might have trouble      gettin" em to stop!    </p>    <p>      If you're plagued by hard-to-heal skinned knuckles,      fissured fingertips, and other such minor cuts and      scrapes-the telltale signs of hardworking handsSherwin      Kelley of Bentonville, Virginia has an old farm recipe that      he'd like to share.<br />      <br />      Mix 2 ounces of "green" (liquid antiseptic) soap, 2 ounces      of plain glycerin, and 4 ounces of bay rum (an old-timey      after-shave lotion)all available from most drugstores-and      pour the concoction Into a clean plastic shampoo bottle      with a flip-up spout for handy dispensing.<br />      <br />      Rub the ointment Into your hands well ... and by morning,      the smaller nicks will have healed and the larger wounds      will be protected by a soft covering of "skin". Continued      application of the salve will prevent the formation of hard      scabs, which are easily cracked or prematurely knocked      off.<br />      <br />      "I've boon using and recommending this skin-care formula      for nigh onto ton years now," claims Sherwin Kelley,      "and-so far-my liniment's success rate Is 100%."<br />      <br /><hr />      <em>OK.
