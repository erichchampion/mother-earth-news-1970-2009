        For centuries, herbs were the main source of beauty aids ... then along came the big cosmetic companies, and the world was swamped with (sometimes dangerous) chemicals. Lately, however-as we rediscover organic recipes-herbs, fruits, and vegetables have found their way back onto milady's makeup table.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I recently read a magazine article in which a duchess and a princess (folks who can certainly afford "the best") recommended the use of exotic plants for beauty care. About that same time-as I searched through some old family hideaways for my grandmother's salve recipeI came upon a list of beauty tips that Grandma had once written out for her daughter (my aunt).<br /><br />There wasn't that much difference between royalty's road to loveliness and Grandma's, either ... except the old girl didn't buy most of her materials. She grew 'em!<br /><br />Here's the advice that my grandmother wrote down for her daughter those many years ago:<br /><br />IN THE MORNING: Mix a handful of oatmeal with enough spring water to make a paste, and put this mixture on your face and neck. When it dries, rinse the paste off with whey, then -with water, and dry your skin with a soft rag.<br /><br />AT NIGHT: Rub a mixture of honey and glycerin onto your face, then wipe it off gently-after a while-with a soft cloth.<br /><br />ONCE A WEEK: Add a teaspoon of honey to one mashed apple, mix them together, and put this "cream" on your face and neck. Leave it in place for half an hour, and then rinse with whey or cold milk. (Make sure your husband will be gone awhile before you start this treatment!)<br /><br />TO SMOOTH WRINKLES: Apply barley water and a few drops of balm of Gilead to your wrinkles every day.<br /><br />TO BLEACH YOUR SKIN: Rub cucumber slices on your face.<br /><br />FOR SOFT HANDS: Shake a half cup of glycerin, a half cup of rose water, and a quarter cup of witch hazel in a jar. Apply this to your hands after they've been in water.<br /><br />TO HEAL CHAPPED HANDS: Rub them with damp table salt.<br /><br />FOR BRIGHT HAIR: Add vinegar to the rinse water after washing your hair, or make a rinse of mullein, nettle, sage, or burdock tea.<br /><br />TO DARKEN GRAY HAIR: Boil an ounce of chamomile or sage in a quart of water for 20 minutes. Rinse your hair with this brew, and use a hairbrush dipped in strong chamomile or sage tea.<br /><br />TO PREVENT DANDRUFF: Rub a tea made from the leaves and bark of a willow into your scalp. Rinse the area with marsh mallow tea.<br /><br />FOR A RELAXING BATH: Hang a bag of dried comfrey or rosemary In the bath water.<br /><br />FOR PERFUME: Fill a jar with pressed rose petals (or any sweet-scented flowers), add as much glycerin as the container will hold, and cover It tightly. After three weeks, you can pour the perfume off into a bottle.<br /><br />TO MAKE A SACHET: Combine one ounce each of powdered cloves, caraway seed, nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon with six ounces of powdered orrisroot. Put the mixture in fancy bags and place them in closets and dresser drawers.<br /><br />Now, some of the ingredients that Granny mentioned may not be familiar to you. Take "balm of Gilead", for example. That's just plain ol' balsam. And "marsh mallow tea" sounds like a sticky mess, but Grandma wasn't talking about the soft, white candy ... she was referring to the root of the marsh mallow plant. "Orrisroot", another name that may be puzzling to modern folk, Is the dried, powdered root of various European Iris plants.<br /><br />Grandma foraged or grew most of her Ingredients, but you can often find them in health food stores, supermarkets, and pharmacies ... or even still growin' wild along the roadside.<br /><br />Naturally (no pun Intended), I started to use some of these old-time recipes and found that comfrey does make a nice skin softener ... while oatmeal leaves the skin silky and is especially good on oily teenage complexions,<br /><br />However, a word of caution: Anyone can be allergic to almost anything, so check out any unfamiliar substance before you rub it all over yourself. To do this, just place a small amount on the tender skin of your inner arm and cover the area with an adhesive bandage. Then wait 24 hours and have a look. If the patch shows any reaction, such as redness or obvious irritation ... that ingredient just isn't for you.<br /><br />My grandmother often said she didn't feel a bit older at 80 than she did at 16, and she didn't took her age either. Did this wonderful woman's organic beauty rituals account for her natural glow and glamour? Well, leis just say that-after a few weeks of using some of Grandma's "secrets"-I've begun to believe that they did!
