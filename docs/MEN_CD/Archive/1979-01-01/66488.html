            		<hr />    <p>      Reader Ron Spomer has the "inside line" on how you can get      a regular supply of. ..    </p>        		<hr />		 <p>      While on a trip to the local garbage dump to gather leaf      mulch (conveniently prepackaged in plastic bags), my friend      Tom and I discovered a yellow heap of dead chicks lying      near an air-befouling incinerator.    </p>    <p>      In answer to my shocked questions, Tom explained to me that      the local hatchery often dumped its "worthless" rooster      chicks there ... birds that-since they couldn't      produce eggs-"nobody wanted".    </p>    <p>      Well, that pile of dead birds set my brain to working, so      later that afternoon Tom and I drove to the hatchery and      told the dealer that we'd be glad to take a batch of those      doomed roosters off his hands. The gentleman was most      agreeable, and we left with instructions to pick up our      gratis fowl on the following Friday. Our great      chicken-raising adventure had begun!    </p>    <h3>      A FREE BROODER, TOO!    </h3>    <p>      While we awaited the appointed day, Tom and I prepared a      home for our expected babies. First, we secured a large      fiberboard box (the size that washing machines and      refrigerators are shipped in) from a friendly appliance man      and placed it on its side in our garage. The inside corners      were rounded out with sheets of cardboard (to keep the      chicks from bunchin' up and squashin' each other)      and-for a heat source- we hung a 100-watt light      bulb 18 inches above the "floor" of the makeshift brooder.    </p>    <p>      With this low-cost housing completed, it was time to move      in the "furniture". A coffee can, placed upside down in a      "throwaway" aluminum pie plate, was dubbed a feeder.      Another pair of the same items-with the addition of      two sticks glued to the inner surface of the      pan-worked as a "waterer". (The sticks held the      coffee can a quarter-inch above the pan's bottom and      allowed the water to rise to that height.) Of course, we      could've purchased small feeders or waterers for under a      dollar from the hardware store, but this was a low-buck      operation.    </p>    <p>      We had no ground corncobs, cut straw, or wood chips for      floor litter, so we just lined the bottom of the brooder      with several layers of newspaper and hoped for the best.    </p>    <p>      The rest of our "waiting period" was spent in a search for      information. The neighboring farmers' wives who raised      chickens were all pessimistic: Our "brooder" wouldn't be      warm enough, we were told . . . the chicks would get      diseases and die. It was all quite depressing.    </p>    <h3>      A HALE AND HARDY BROOD    </h3>    <p>      Nevertheless, both Tom and I were very excited when Friday      finally arrived, and we hurried to the hatchery for our      formal introduction to 75 yellow puffs of down. I would've      sworn that the small box we carried home couldn't hold 75      chicks, but we counted 78 when we put our foundlings into      their new home.    </p>    <p>      What a racket the little critters made! Their chorus began      in earnest every time anyone opened the "roof". So, I cut      an "air/peep hole" high on each side of the box ... to      allow the condensation to escape, and to let us watch the      chicks without setting off a pandemonium of peeping.    </p>    <p>      The newspapers on the floor had to be changed every three      or four days, but-though we still lacked hay or straw      to use for litter- we soon learned to strew dried grass,      leaves, and even light dirt on top of the paper to absorb      the droppings and keep the floor dry. When it was time to      freshen up, we simply lifted the newspapers by the corners      and put the entire nitrogen-rich mess (yesterday's news and      all) into the compost heap.    </p>    <p>      Our brood was initially fed commercial chicken starter that      we purchased at the hatchery as a requested "payment" for      the free birds. The contents printed on the bag, however,      didn't impress us, so Tom and I found some oats to      supplement the starter feed. One longtime chicken raiser      assured us the oats would puncture our little birds' crops,      but he was wrong ... as were all the other "experts" who      forecast disease and death.    </p>    <p>      After three weeks, we moved all 78 chicks into a spare 3' X      5' building with two south-facing windows. The southern      exposure-plus the warm spring nights-allowed us to      eliminate the heat bulb in the chickens' new quarters.    </p>    <p>      By this time, our fledglings were consuming great      quantities of both food and drink, so we built two more      feeders and another waterer, all of which had to be      refilled every 24 hours. Our first casualty occurred along      about then. Cause of death: unknown ... but the other 77      were thriving.    </p>    <h3>      ROOSTERS ON THE RANGE    </h3>    <p>      Finally, it was time to put the young cocks into our big      barn, from which they could sally forth to raid the weed      and insect strongholds. That first day, however, saw no      brave recruits step from the dim security of their new      barracks. Nor did the second. On the third day we resorted      to tossing several of the spineless birds out into the      sunlight. They fought each other frantically to get back      in.    </p>    <p>      Clearly, something had to be done to bolster our warriors'      courage, so we picked some weeds and threw them to the      flock. Snap, peck, gulp ... they were gone. We laid some      more goodies in the exit hole. They disappeared! We put      some just outside the hole. Several white heads jabbed at      them. Eventually, we enticed a few of the birds out into      the open with the treats, and-from then on-it was "goodbye      feed bill"!    </p>    <p>      It was our assumption that chickens-given free run of      our 80 acres- could feed themselves just as wild pheasants      did ... and this theory proved correct. We lost nary a bird      after that to disease or deprivation (although our two      young pups did kill several in a "friendly game of tag").    </p>    <p>      And, as the birds grew, their range extended. By October,      the roosters had grown brave enough to wander 400 yards and      more in every direction. Toward evening our various patrols      would hike back to the barn to roost, but-at sunup the next      morning-they sounded the battle cry and, again,      deployed to the far comers of the farm.    </p>    <h3>      TASTY ON THE TABLE    </h3>    <p>      As a result of their "foraged" diet of vegetation, weed      seeds, and insects, our chickens grew the deepest-red combs      and wattles we'd ever seen. Their tail plumes rose in crisp      arcs and waved proudly at the rear guard. Their -long neck      hackles draped them in vanity, while they strutted with      heads high, challenging all comers.    </p>    <p>      Since this proud company could lay no eggs to earn their      keep, they had to pay their way with meat on the table ...      and we began to thin their ranks. Several,, roosters had      already become delicious. spring fryers, and the others      were soon sold, given to friends, or wrapped for the      freezer.    </p>    <p>      One salty old farm wife, who had raised chickens most of      her life, said we had the healthiest fowls she'd ever seen.      And my aunt-a farmer for some 70-odd      years-butchered a few of our roosters and declared      them so pretty, proud, and meaty that she "almost couldn't      kill 'em". Best of all, their taste and tenderness would've      turned Colonel Sanders' beard green with envy.    </p>    <h3>      FREE AND EASY    </h3>    <p>      After raising three flocks of these free-roamin' birds, I      have to say that they're the easiest and most economical      meat-growing enterprise possible. The only cash spent in      bringin' up those first orphans went for the four bags of      commercial starter feed from the hatchery, the 100-watt      bulb that heated our brooder, and, of course, electricity.    </p>    <p>      And the hatchery that supplies us is only one of thousands      across the country that have excess cockerels which must be      destroyed each week of the hatching season. Any one of      these outfits is a probable source of no-cost chicks to      fill your freezer later.    </p>    <p>      Not only that, but you might even pick up a few layin' hens      along the way. No one can sex every chick correctly, and a      group of 75 alleged cocks will usually contain some      pullets. Our first flock had four females ... our second,      five.    </p>    <p>      Just one last word: If you do elect to raise some "free      chickens", be sure you're willing to wake up every morning      to a crowing chorus of the healthiest, rowdiest roosters      around!    </p>
