                <p>      MEDICAL SELF-CARE    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Tom Ferguson, M.D    </h5>        <p>      This issue's column is an edited version of a conversation      I had with Marion Nestle, an associate dean and lecturer in      medicine and biochemistry at the University of California      School of Medicine in San Francisco. Dr. Nestle teaches      nutrition to health science students, as well as to      resident physicians, and she coordinates nutrition      education within the School of Medicine. A Ph.D. in      molecular biology from the University of California at      Berkeley, Dr. Nestle is also a contributing editor of      Medical Self-Care.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Many people say that medical      schools generally ignore the area of nutrition science. Do      you agree?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Yes . . . and even when the      subject is included in a curriculum, the classes tend to be      inadequate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Why?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Well, first of all, many people      who teach biochemistry, physiology, or other "hard"      sciences are a bit contemptuous of nutrition . . . they      don't consider it a real science. After all, because of the      field's relative newness, nutrition researchers don't have      the huge body of well-controlled corroborating data that      most other sciences can call upon . . . so it's often      difficult to make a convincing scientific argument for the      importance of diet in medicine.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Is there any other reason why      many medical students receive little or no practical      nutrition training?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Probably the biggest reason is      that we all-doctors and laypersons alike-tend      to view medicine as a curative, rather than a preventive,      science. Most people see a physician only when they're sick      and need immediate help. They don't come to get advice on      nutrition . . . they come to get treated for an illness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Recently, I saw a quote by      Harvard nutritionist jean Mayer, who said-in      effect-that the average doctor knows little more      about nutrition than the average nonphysician.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Well, perhaps that's a bit unfair      to physicians . . . most doctors are fairly well trained in      such technical subjects as carbohydrate biochemistry and      metabolic functions. But they generally don't know how to      apply that textbook knowledge in a way that's useful to      people. In other words, they fail to relate that basic      information to their patients' actual eating habits and      diets. They need to understand, for example, the importance      of the differences between foods that contain starch and      those that contain sugar. When a patient asks a question      concerning nutrition-about, for instance, which foods      are and are not beneficial to that particular      individual-the doc tor should be able to provide a      practical, meaningful answer.    </p>    <p>      Plus, since proper diet plays an important preventive and      curative role in many diseases, a physician should be      cognizant of what is known-and not known-about      dietary approaches to dealing with common chronic illnesses      such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and high blood      pressure. Nutritionists and dieticians are especially      trained to counsel patients on eating habits, so doctors      should know when and how to refer patients to such experts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Isn't recommending a balanced      diet a commonsense first step?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Absolutely. The evidence is      increasingly clear that the dietary goals and guidelines      established by the McGovern committee and the U.S.      Department of Agriculture represent a unified approach to      both normal-that is, preventive-and therapeutic      diets. Generally, the same food regimen that's best for      health is also the one to recommend to people with heart      disease, diabetes, or obesity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> What, exactly, is this "unified"      dietary approach?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> It's simple enough: Eat      unprocessed foods that are high in complex carbohydrates      and in fiber . . . such as fruits, vegetables, and whole      grain cereals. Go easy on the fat, salt, and sugar. And eat      a wide range of foods. Variety is important because foods      differ in the kinds and amounts of nutrients they contain,      so consuming an assortment of comestibles-and I'm      speaking here of non-junk foods, with high nutrient      densities-can help a person be sure that he or she is      getting all of the necessary nutrients.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> What do you mean when you say      "high nutrient density"?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> That's just nutritionists' jargon      for a food that's rich in nutrients and low in calories.      Junk foods, of course, are just the reverse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> You mentioned to me once that      you require your medical students to record a 24-hour diet      inventory. How useful is such a practice . . . and what's      involved?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Well, the process is a bit      tedious, but it teaches a great deal about the importance      of watching what you ingest. You simply list everything you      eat and drink in one day, and afterwards look up the      nutrients present in each edible in standard food      composition tables. Then add up the daily totals, and      compare those figures with nutritional guidelines such as      the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances. It's fascinating to      find out which nutrients are present in common foods. Many      people, for example, are surprised to find how much protein      is in vegetables.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> What books would you rec ommend      for those who want to do a one-day, diet inventory?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Composition of Foods, and Laurel's      Kitchen. Composition is the standard source for nutritional      information. Laurel', Kitchen is a vegetarian cookbook with      a long and truly excellent section on the principle, of      nutrition . . . and the text is accompanied by very handy      food-composition tables. I just wish that the book included      more information for people who eat meat!    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> Do you have any advice on how to      shop for groceries . . . and how to determine which foods      are nourishing and which are not?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Yes. If you buy food in a      supermarket try to avoid the center aisles. All of the      real, unprocessed foods-the vegetables, fruits,      meats, and dairy products-are generally located      around the periphery of the store. But the low-nutrient      junk foods are usually kept in the center aisles, so stagy      away from those areas. And by all means, read the products'      labels. The information on such wrappers isn't always      complete, but at least it will tell you which products do      and do not contain undesirable ingredients such as sugar,      salt, fats, and additives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FERGUSON:</strong> One final question: Have your      own eating habits changed as you've learned more about      nutrition?    </p>    <p>      <strong>NESTLE:</strong> Yes, but it has been a gradual      process. For example, I'm still not a strict vegetarian,      but my family's diet has certainly moved increasingly in      that direction. And we haven't used salt in a long time.      Generally, I simply try to follow the same basic advice I      give to my students and others: Eat a variety of whole,      unprocessed foods in moderation. And above all, enjoy your      meals . . . a healthful diet doesn't have to be boring!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The U.S. Department of      Agriculture's</em> <em>Composition of Foods (Agricultural      Handbook Number 8) is available for $7.00 from the      Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing      Office, Dept.
