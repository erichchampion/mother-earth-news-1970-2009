                    <p>      <strong>FEDERAL ENERGY WASTE:</strong> A recent      Congressional report says that the Reagan Administration      has failed to implement numerous recommended low- or      no-cost energy-conservation measures in public facilities      and, as a result, is wasting tens of millions of dollars.      According to John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy      Committee, energy consumption by the U.S.      government-the nation's largest user-rose by      3.4% in fiscal 1981 after having dropped 6.3% during the      previous administration's final two years. The report      claims that federal conservation efforts have been "stalled      to a complete standstill" under Reagan. For a free copy of      the 41-page paper, "Wasted Energy Dollars in the Federal      Government" (publication 97-HH), call 202/225-0222, or send      a self-addressed mailing label to the House Committee on      Energy and Commerce, Dept. TMEN, Room B-334, Rayburn House      Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515.<br />      <br />      <strong>TODAY'S MAIL: TWO LETTERS AND UNCLE FRED?</strong>      "People and parcels" deliveries may become commonplace in      the future if the powers that be listen to James H.      Miller-director of Pennsylvania State University's      Public Transportation Program-who suggests that rural      mail carriers could provide a valuable, fuel-saving, and      perhaps profitable service by hauling passengers as well as      ordinary postal fare. Miller points out that double-duty      dispatch is common in Germany, Sweden, and Finland . . .      but hastens to add that, in this country, it would probably      be best handled by private carriers, rather than the U.S.      Postal Service.<br />      <br />      <strong>SOLAR GROWTH:</strong> Here are some highlights      from a revealing study by the Solar Lobby and the Center      for Renewable Resources: The amount of energy used to      produce one dollar of Gross National Product has decreased      by about 6% since 1978 (an indication that the nation is      using energy more efficiently) . . . there are now between      60,000 and 80,000 solar homes in the U.S. (there were      roughly 500 in 1977) . . . sales of active solar collectors      rose from $17 million in 1975 to $400 million in 1981 . . .      and, between 1975 and 1980, total combined sales figures      for passive and active "suncatchers"-including      photovoltaic cells-increased by 155% annually!<br />      <br />      <strong>ALAS, EVERYTHING'S RELATIVE:</strong> Although the      aforementioned study observes that Americans have invested      an impressive-sounding $10.5 billion in solar technology      since the turn of the decade, the report also points out      that we spend $80 billion every year for oil . . . and      that, in 1980, consumers spent more on lipstick than on      solar collectors.<br />      <br />      <strong>MAKING TWO RIGHTS FROM TWO WRONGS:</strong> Last      year, Columbia University's Helmut Schulz developed a      process called Simplex Coal and Biomass Gasification      that-according to the university's Office of Public      Information-involves combining municipal wastes with      coal to make briquettes . . . which, when burned, produce a      pollutant-free fuel gas. Now, Mr. Schulz has reportedly      taken the technique a step further: When hazardous      substances such as PCB's and toxic heavy metals are      included in the briquette "recipe", the process also yields      a sandlike silica-aluminum slag, which-it's      claimed-encases the residual poisons and can be used      as a harmless road-building material!<br />      <br />      <strong>A MAGNETICALLY LEVITATED TEN-TON TRAIN</strong>      hurtled along a four-kilometer run at speeds upward of 186      MPH during tests at Miyazaki, Japan earlier this year.      Current induced into magnetic coils laid on each side and      along the bottom of a U-shaped "track" created a field with      the same polarity as that produced by superconduct_ ing      magnets in the body of the train itself. The resultant      repelling forces lifted, propelled, and guided the      fullsize, two-car prototype.<br />      <br />      <strong>OUR CANDIDATE FOR "TEASE-SHIRT" OF THE      YEAR:</strong> <strong>Multinational Monitor</strong> , a      monthly publication from the Corporate Accountability      Research Group, is offering-in "celebration" of the      100th anniversary of Exxon, the world's largest      company-a white T-shirt that's emblazoned with the      following red-and-blue printed message (complete with      corporate logo): "We don't care. We don't have to care.      We're EXXON. At Exxon we're part of the problem." The      shirts are available (small, medium, large, and      extra-large) for $8.95 each, two for $17, or three for $24      . . . postpaid from <strong>Multinational Monitor,</strong>      Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 19405, Washington, D.C. 20036.      (Incidentally, if you'd like to receive the magazine, send      along an additional $15 for a one-year subscription.)<br />      <br />      <strong>"ENERGY AND THE ELDERLY SOURCEBOOK"</strong> is a      60-page guide to state and federal agencies, plus      nongovernment organizations, that can help senior citizens      weather the rising costs of home heating and cooling. The      booklet-which also includes an analysis of the      energy-related problems of older people-is free from      the American Association of Retired Persons, Dept. TMEN,      1909 K Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049.<br />      <br />      <strong>WHAT PRICE FIREWOOD?</strong> According to a survey      by the monthly <strong>Wood 'n Ener Solid Fuel      Journal</strong> (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 2008, Concord, New      Hampshire 03301 . . . subscriptions 24 per year), people in      Tennessee generally pay the lowest prices in the country      for a seasoned cord of delivered fuel wood: $33 in rural      areas and just $40 in urban Chattanooga. Californians, on      the other hand, burn the most money per cord: $125 in rural      Auburn, and a whopping $245 in Los Angeles.    </p>    <p>      The Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Company of Maui, Hawaii will      <strong>BURN WASTE NUTSHELLS</strong> in a new 840-KW      cogenerator turbine system, and use the power produced to      provide all its electricity plus the steam required for      process drying ....
