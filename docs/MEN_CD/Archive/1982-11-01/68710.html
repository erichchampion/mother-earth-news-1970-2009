            			<p>			 An extra room and a      bit of hospitality can bring you friends and supplement      your income.			</p>			 			<h5 id="byline">by Dennis W. Brezina</h5>    			<p>			 Many residents of the British Isles traditionally open their homes to tourists by      operating bed-and-breakfast establishments. Such      enterprises are just what the name implies: Guests receive      overnight accommodations, and breakfast the following      morning, in exchange for a (usually modest) fee. The system      is often ideal for all parties involved, too . . . since      the travelers enjoy both home-style lodging and family      hospitality, while their hosts have the opportunity to meet      new people and earn a little money, to boot!</p><p> Not long ago,      the bed-and-breakfast concept was imported to the United      States (via California) and embellished somewhat in the      process. For one thing, the system has become much more      organized in security-conscious America. </p><p>But even so, the      U.S.A.'s version of bed and breakfast is catching      on-in much the same manner that motels did during the      1950's-with economy-minded tourists and business      people. And in these days of hard-to-find employment and      rising costs, operating such a facility is also popular      among homeowners looking for new ways to help pay the      mortgage and find some tax relief.</p><p> Of course, as is the      case with any undertaking, the success of such an      enterprise will depend upon the commitment of the people      running it. But any family with a sizable home that's near      vacation spots, tourist attractions, or urban centers will      certainly have an advantage from the outset.      </p>			<p>			<strong>LEARNING THE ROPES</strong>			</p>			<p>			 When my wife and I first began discussing the possibility of trying our hands      at running a B & B business, we wondered whether      there'd be problems with zoning laws and/or our homeowner's      insurance, and we also worried a bit about whether we'd be      comfortable letting strangers "live" in our home.</p><p> However,      we went ahead and took the initial step of contacting a few      referral services. It wasn't long before the directors of      those agencies visited our home and interviewed us . . . in      order to determine whether our accommodations were      suitable. All of our questions about the B & B process      itself were answered to our satisfaction at that time ...      particularly those regarding the kinds of people who prefer      this mode of lodging.</p><p> Our concerns about allowing people to      stay in our restored nineteenth century farmhouse were      reduced when we learned that we'd always receive advance      information about the travelers-names, addresses,      occupations, references, etc.and could accept or refuse      their registration at that point without any further      obligation. We also discovered that we were free to set our      own rules. For example, my wife and I agreed that we didn't      want to host folks with young children . . . because our      home's long staircases would pose a hazard, and the      extensive woods surrounding the house are loaded with      poison ivy.</p><p> We decided to prohibit pets and smoking, too.      Now-having had some experience in the      matter-we've discovered that most people seeking a B      & B lodging tend to be friendly, well-traveled      individuals . . . folks who prefer atmosphere to amenities      and who practically tiptoe around the house to show their      respect.</p><p> Getting clear answers to our questions about      zoning and insurance matters was more difficult, but we      think we've arrived at satisfactory conclusions. It seems      that as long as one doesn't attempt to open a fullfledged      guest house-complete with three meals a      day-most local zoning regulations won't prohibit      operating an unlicensed, small-scale bedand-breakfast      business. Furthermore, homeowner's policies typically cover      liability for paying guests to some degree.</p><p> And at least a      few of the B & B organizations provide-as a      membership fee benefit-additional insurance to cover      any guests they refer. My wife and I explored the      possibility of adding coverage through our insurance      company, but the subject soon began to seem exceedingly      complicated (at first, understandably enough, our carrier      didn't even know what B & B was). As a result, we      decided not to change our insurance, opting instead to      simply assume some risk ourselves.			</p>			<p>			 <strong>BUSINESS BASICS</strong>			</p>			<p>			 We joined two B & B organizations in      the late summer of 1981, at a total yearly cost of $65.      (The money would have been refunded if no guests had been      referred to us.) Now that we look back, we realize that we      picked an ideal season to begin our enterprise ... because      our "late" start allowed us time to get ready for a      moderately active spring and a busy summer.</p><p> However, those      living near ski resorts or other cold weather vacation      centers will possibly find that winter is the busiest      season. As we waited (with a mixture of anticipation and      nervousness) for our first guests to arrive, an important      question came up: What sort of records would we have to      keep? My experience as a writer, coupled with the knowledge      I picked up during a six-month stint in direct sales,      proved useful in helping me set up the necessary paperwork.      Basically, we employed a system of tracking income and      expenses.</p><p> Some of our first-year guests paid directly ...      others sent a deposit to the B & B referral service and      paid us the balance. (An organization making a referral      receives a percentage of that customer's lodging fee . . .      in our case, 15% of either $30 per person per day or $35      per couple per day.)</p><p> We simply recorded our guest income in      an appointment book under that specific day, and      later-at the end of each month-transferred      those figures, along with all our itemized expenses, to the      income tax record book. Happily enough, we found-once      we got our business underway-that the expenses      weren't great. As you'd imagine, some of our cash outlay      took the form of the normal costs of running a household .</p><p>      . . which were marginally increased by serving      bed-and-breakfast guests. In order to determine what      percentage of our home maintenance costs to deduct as B      & B business expenses, my wife and I      estimated-figuring from autumn to autumn-the      total guest-days we anticipated for the first year at 200      (which would be equivalent to one person staying for 200      days or one couple visiting 100 days).</p><p> After further rough      calculations, we planned to deduct 25% (which we later      reduced when the actual number of guest-days fell short of      our prediction) of the cost of household cleaners, paper      supplies, bedding, garbage pickup, electricity, fuel oil,      and insurance on the house. (Our telephone was rarely used      for business reasons, so we excluded its cost from our      deductions.) We didn't attempt to claim depreciation on our      house, either . . . although if a profit had remained after      subtracting that-as well as our other      expenses-from our business income, it would have been      perfectly legitimate to do so.</p><p> (It is true, however, that      if a dwelling is depreciated, for such purposes, the      process places limits on capital gains benefits ifthat      house is sold and a new home is purchased.) My spouse and I      also calculated $2.00 as our average cost per day to feed      each guest. This included a large country breakfast      (although that meal can be simple "continental" fare,      perhaps juice and rolls) plus refreshments in the afternoon      or evening. </p><p>Our other expenses included the cost of      advertising in nearby suburban newspapers (because we      eventually decided to promote our B & B biz ourselves,      to augment the efforts of the services we'd joined) . . .      money spent on postage, stationery, and a self-designed      brochure . . . and the cost of operating a car on B & B      errands (we deducted a flat 20 cents per mile whenever we      used our 1978 Buick for business purposes)			</p>			<p>			<strong>BUDGET      BREAKDOWN</strong>			</p>			<p>			 Our endeavor grossed $1,750 during the      first year . . . a figure which reflected the income from      100 actual guest-days. Our expenses for that period totaled      $1,100 . . . although that sum included part of the cost of      two room air conditioners (depreciated over five years), a      house sign for the main road, and about $300 spent on      promotional materials. The remainder went for food ($200),      travel ($180), electricity and fuel oil ($175), insurance      ($90), and garbage disposal ($18). We figure that had we      reached our initial estimate of 200 guestdays, we would      have doubled our income to $3,500 while increasing our      expenses by only about $400. Of course, since we achieved      only 50% of our yearly goal, we deducted only 12,5010 of      our household expenses (rather than the 25% we'd originally      calculated). However, if our second year is as good as we      anticipate, the 25% rule of thumb can be applied.      </p>			<p>			<strong>AND THE BEST PART OF ALL . . .</strong>			</p>			<p>			 Our guests      began arriving in late October. On the first weekend two      couples (the wives were sisters) drove from Buffalo, New      York and Detroit, Michigan to stay at our home in southern      Maryland for three days. We charged each couple $38 per day      (the service that referred them had set that price), and we      received a full fact sheet of information on each couple      before they arrived. The service took a 15% commission      ($34.20), and we received the remaining $193.80 . . . which      much more than compensated us for our annual B & B      membership fees.</p><p> When our visitors showed up, we placed cut      flowers in the bedrooms, offered maps and tourist      information, and -after they'd settled in-tried      to be generally accessible for conversation without being      intrusive or bothersome. (Such little touches, we believe,      hell) assure our travelers a pleasant stay.)</p><p> As the year      went on, we discovered that our guests would typically send      us warm letters of thanks, and we even exchanged greeting      cards with some of them during the holiday season. </p><p>Now, as      we approach our second year as hosts, we understand the      business much better. We've developed good working      relationships with the referral groups arid become better      at promoting the service ourselves. </p><p>Setting up our home as      a bed-and-breakfast retreat for travelers      has-my wife and I agree-been one of the best      (and most gratifying) decisions we've ever made. It's      brought a lot of satisfaction into our lives, and we hope      into the lives of our guests as well.</p><p> EDITOR'S NOTE: Robert      Bensen of Burlington, Vermont has published a directory      that lists 90 bed-and-breakfast referral services located      throughout the United States, Canada, and the British      Isles.

I      guess I felt a sort of obligation to return tire favor to      fellow travelers when our fancily acquired a 100-year-old,      two-story Victorian house that had an extra room we almost      never used.</p><p> My husband-being a gregarious sort and an      excellent breakfast cook-was delighted to take on the      "hospitality" part of the job during the summer. (He's a      high school teacher and has those months "off", while I      work throughout the year.)</p><p> We began our adventure by      placing art ad in the classified section of MOTHER. We felt      that this periodical would speak to the type of people we'd      like to have visit us (and who'd be likely to try an      unfamiliar form of travel accommodation). The advertisement      cost about $50 . . . and was published in early summer We      received six responses almost immediately after the      magazine hit the newsstands.</p><p> My husband and I had composed      a letter of introduction, which we sent to each of the      respondents. In tire note we described our arrangement, our      location in relation to tourist attractions (in our case      these included the World's Fair, the Great Smoky Mountains,      and MOTHER's own Eco-Village), and our charges ($18.50 for      a single adult, $32.50 for two adults, and special rates      for children).</p><p> About half the folks replied to our letter.      We requested a one-night deposit to confirm any reservation      (with the promise of a full refund if we were notified of      cancellation at least seven days before the scheduled      visit, and a return of all but $10 if we were notified less      titan a week before).</p><p> When the flurry of inquiries and      letters died down, one couple-a mother and her 15      year-old daughter-made a confirmed reservation for three      nights' lodging. We were delighted . . . their visit would      cover the cost of the ad and then some, and we'd get a      chance to meet some interesting people while giving them a      comfortable, friendly place to sleep and have breakfast!      Furthermore, this one-time venture would also give us art      opportunity to see how we'd like having strangers in the      house . . . and to decide whether we might later want to      tackle a booked-solid summer of guests.</p><p> I sent a map      directing the pair to our home, and my husband and I spent      a lull Saturday cleaning the room . . . putting in fragrant      flowers . . . sprucing up the large old-fashioned bathroom      (complete with a claw-footed tub) . . . and stocking up on      eggs, cereal, and milk. When our-guests arrived late      in the afternoon of the following Saturday, we were sitting      on the front porch ready to greet them. Our visitors turned      out to be most pleasant . . . they were neat, ate a light      breakfast (and were thrilled by our homemade bread acrd      jam), left early in the day for sightseeing, and returned      in the evening to have a soak in the tub, read a bit, and      retire early. During their three-day stay, they sometimes      joined us in the rockers on the porch and chatted.</p><p> We      learned that their visit was an experiment also, since      they'd never stayed in a B & B home before . . . and we      all agreed that the arrangement was well worth continuing.      (They even offared to let us leave similar accommodations      at their home ore the Florida coast!)</p><p> The venture did snake      us a little money, but more important, it gave us the      opportunity to be hospitable to "strangers in a strange      land" . . . and reminded us that we're all just neighbors      in a small, small world.    </p>
