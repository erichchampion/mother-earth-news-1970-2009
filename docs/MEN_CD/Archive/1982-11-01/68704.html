                <p>      A meal's worth of nutrition in a muffin? It's possible with      . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Vern Hoven    </h5>        <p>      "Mmmmmm . . . that's good," exclaimed my husband Ray, as      the courteous smile he'd put on before his first tentative      bite of one of my new muffins broadened into a grin of      sincere culinary appreciation. And after my spouse finished      devouring several of the piping hot morsels, I knew I had a      success on my hands.    </p>    <p>      I dubbed my creations "fluffins", in reference to their      unbelievably light texture. However, this attribute, while      important, isn't the main virtue of the baked goods . . .      nutrition is. Fluffins, you see, are rich in protein,      minerals, and vitamins . . . supply a respectable amount of      unrefined carbohydrate . . . use no fat at all, yet are as      light and delicate as a breeze . . . and have a nutty      goodness that's all their own.    </p>    <p>      On other occasions when I've tried to go all out for extra      nutrition in a muffin, the result has usually been tough,      heavy, flat-tasting, and/or fattening. So I was-as      you'd imagine-very pleased when I hit upon the      fluffin formula, which turns out a quick bread that's      light, delicious, nutritious, and relatively low in      calories, to boot!    </p>    <p>      The secret lies, of course, in the ingredients: Buckwheat      is nonglutenous, as are rice bran, rice polish, and almond      meal. There's only half a cup of unbleached wheat flour in      the recipe, and the moist, fluffy batter is made without      any shortening. Almonds are the nuts highest in protein and      lowest in fat. The rice bran and eggs are also loaded with      protein . . . and the buckwheat and wheat flour add still      more. Furthermore, many of the ingredients are rich in a      variety of minerals. And if you prefer to use milk instead      of water as your liquid, you'll sup ply more minerals and      protein.    </p>    <p>      Better still, this nutritious treat isn't at all difficult      to make. Begin by preheating your oven to      350°-375°F, and then grease and flour a 12-cup      muffin tin (or a 9" X 12" cakepan). Next, place the      following dry ingredients in a mixing bowl:    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup of buckwheat flour<br />      1/2 cup of almond meal<br />      1/2 cup of rice bran (or rice polish)<br />      1/2 cup of unbleached wheat flour<br />      1/2 cup of raw or turbinado sugar<br />      3 teaspoons of doubleacting baking powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon of baking soda<br />      1/2 cup of raisins (optional)    </p>    <p>      Most of these ingredients should be available at your      favorite natural foods store. But since almond meal is      expensive, I make it myself-in the amount that I      need-by dropping unblanched almonds into the blender,      a handful at a time. (EDITOR'S NOTE: A local health food      store owner, whom MOTHER consulted, suggested that readers      would do best to follow the author's example. It seems that      many such shops don't stock freshly ground almond-or      other nut-meat because of its tendency to turn rancid      quickly.) If you don't have any almonds on hand, you can      substitute a half-cup of wheat bran, and your fluffins will      still be delicious (though almond fanciers certainly won't      like them as well). As for the choice between rice bran and      rice polish, just bear in mind that the polish is lighter,      but the bran is more nutritious.    </p>    <p>      Once you've measured out the dry ingredients, mix them      thoroughly with a hand beater, and set the bowl aside.      Next, measure 1/4 cup of unsulfured molasses into another      dish, add 3/4 cup of water (or milk, if you prefer), and      blend them well. With that done, beat two eggs in a third      container.    </p>    <p>      Now, simply combine the liquid and dry ingredients, and mix      them until they're well moistened (do not beat . . . stir      only until the mixture is relatively smooth). Pour the      batter into the greased and floured tin and bake the      muffins for 20 to 30 minutes. Use a cake tester, a      toothpick, or a clean broom straw to check for doneness.    </p>    <p>      I like to serve fluffins steaming hot from the oven . . .      split and anointed with butter, an all-natural margarine,      or some other favorite topping. Leftovers can be frozen (we      always try to keep a few extras on hand in the freezer) . .      . and, when time is precious, one or two reheated      fluffins-served with a glass of fruit juice or      milk-will make your body think you've had a full      meal!    </p>    <p>      You'll also find that this recipe is exceptionally      versatile. If you prefer a more dessertlike bread, for      instance, use a little more sugar or molasses-or add      some honey-and bake the batter in a cakepan. To make      a chocolaty treat, stir in 3/4 cup of carob powder and a      little more water. Top the sweet creations with your      favorite carob frosting.    </p>    <p>      I serve the muffins often (because of their nutritional      value), so I've found it necessary to develop a few      variations to keep them from becoming monotonous. Sometimes      I add 1/2 cup of soy flour and 1/4 cup of water to the      basic recipe to achieve higher-than-usual protein content.      And stirring in some cinnamon and ginger-plus a few      chopped dates-will produce a spicy      <em>ginger-bread</em> fluffin. But to tell the truth, I've      yet to find a variation that I think improves on the      original.    </p>    <p>      Well, enough of <em>my</em> praise for almond fluffins . .      . give the recipe a try and see what you think. I'm      confident that the results (and your family of      taste-testers) will speak for themselves.    </p>
