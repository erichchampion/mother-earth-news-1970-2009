    <p>
                <p>      Since the heyday of the Rural Electrification      Administration, power production has been pretty much left      to big business . . . but the trend toward centralization      may have begun to reverse.    </p>            <p>      It would be easy to get the impression, in the face of the      controversy and publicity that have been generated by      nuclear energy of late, that fission-derived electricity is      the main source of generated power in the United States.      Therefore, you might be surprised to learn that only about      10% of this country's electrical needs are actually      provided by reactors . . . and that a renewable resource,      hydroelectricity, actually outstrips the atom in terms of      total watts produced.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, most major rivers were dammed decades ago,      and little hydropower capacity has been added in recent      years. And that's a real pity, because water power has      consistently proved to be the least expensive way to      generate electricity and is-many authorities      believe-the most environmentally benign method, as      well. However, there is significant untapped hydropower      potential in small streams, and this source of energy may      be particularly appealing to enterprising individuals with      an eye to the future.    </p>    <p>      Microhydropower is the Department of Energy's term for any      installation with less than 100 kilowatts (KW) of capacity.      (To put that number in perspective, consider that most      households use an average of about 1 KW per hour, while a      nuclear plant might generate about 1,500,000 KW per      reactor.) In the past, the expense of building these very      small hydropower plants couldn't often be justified by the      value of the power generated . . . but, as most of us are      painfully aware, the cost of electricity isn't what it used      to be. Today, a resourceful person with access to some      capital can put together a microhydro site for a price that      makes sense as a long-term investment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DO IT ON PURPA</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the main factors making it possible for a small      hydro site to become a mon eymaking proposition is a      federal regula tion: Section 210 of the Public Utilities      Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA). Among other things,      the edict specifies that power companies must purchase      power from independent producers at what is called "avoided      cost". This means, very briefly, that the utility is forced      to buy the power (which wasn't the case previously) and      that the producers should be paid what it would cost the      power company to generate the same amount of electricity.      [EDITOR'S NOTE: This is all a great deal more complicated      than it sounds . . . so much so, in fact, that the      regulation has been challenged in the Supreme Court.      Nonetheless, nearly all utilities do buy electricity at      this time.]    </p>    <p>      Of course, few companies are paying as much for power as      they're charging for it. (After all, the utilities have      such additional expenses as supplying the lines, customer      service, billing, etc.) But PURPA has made it possible for      small producers to receive at least some payment for the      electricity they're capable of generating. And with      buy-back rates (the price paid by utilities to small-scale      power producers) running between 2 cents and 10 cents per      kilowatt-hour (KWH) across the country, microhydropower is      capable of becoming a paying proposition.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LAUREL CREEK HYDROELECTRIC</strong>    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the best way to understand the potential of      microhydropower is to examine a successful example. Several      of MOTHER's staff members have been keeping an eye on one      such project since its beginnings, and recently paid a      visit to the finished site to see it in full production.    </p>    <p>      The Laurel Creek microhydropower installation was started      back in 1980, when a group of individuals-working      under the auspices of the Blue Ridge Group Sierra Club and      Appalachian State University (both of which have their      headquarters in Boone, North Carolina), and cosponsored by      the Blue Ridge Electrical Membership Corporation      (BREMCO)-got a $21,416 Department of Energy      Appropriate Technology grant to study the microhydropower      potential in Watauga County, North Carolina and build a      demonstration site.    </p>    <p>      Laurel Creek, the waterway they chose, is a cascading      mountain stream in the western part of the county. The      group erected a tiny (two-foot-high) dam, which diverts      water into a penstock . . . and from that point, 1,640 feet      of 8"-diameter plastic sewer pipe stretches down the      mountainside next to the creek, for a total drop of 178      feet.    </p>    <p>      The crew had several good reasons for deciding not to build      a more typical tall dam. First and foremost, they were able      to avoid the primary disadvantage-in the      environmentally oriented minds of the developers-of      large hydropower installations: the need for flooding the      land behind the dam. Second, from a practical standpoint,      the diversion and pipe arrangement allow much more drop (or      "head", in hydro terminology). Third, getting permission      for their project-which required only a verbal OK      from local wildlife agencies-was less complicated      than it would have been if construction of a larger      installation had been planned. And finally, the      expense-even though the pipe alone cost more than      $5,300-was a small fraction of the investment that's      necessary to build a big dam.    </p>    <p>      Of course, before any work was done, the rate of water flow      in Laurel Creek was measured on a regular basis and its      profile compared with that of other streams in the area (as      gauged by the U.S. Geological Survey). Once all the data      were analyzed, Dr. Harvard Ayers (the program director) and      builders Andy Feimster and Bob Powell decided to take no      more than 2.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) of water-or      1,125 gallons per minute-from the creek. That amount      equals about one-third the mean flow in the stream . . .      and will leave sufficient water for aquatic life, while      allowing the plant to operate about 90% of the time.      (Should a severe drought occur, a partial or complete      shutdown of the system would be required in order to      maintain flow in the creek.)    </p>    <p>      Once friction losses in the 8"-diameter pipe were      calculated, the designers found that they had 145 feet of      head to work with. And since any figure over 60 feet is      considered to be within the efficient range of a Pelton      wheel, that popular and widely available turbine was the      obvious choice. The 15 "-hydraulic-diameter runner (which      was supplied by Canyon Industries in Deming, Washington)      looks much like a thick plate with a number of oddly shaped      spoons attached to its periphery. Water shoots at the      buckets from two 2"-diameter nozzles to spin the manganese      bronze casting. The shape of the cups splits the jets and      ushers the water out to the sides of the housing . . .      where it falls (having given up its energy) and exits      through a drain in the floor.    </p>    <p>      This rather primitive-sounding device spins at 720      revolutions per minute (RPM)-under the force of the      roughly 156 pounds per second of H 2 0, moving at just      short of 65 MPH, that strikes it-and the net result      of all this action is the generation of about 30 horsepower      at the 1-5/8" shaft. The turbine is linked to the generator      by a pair of V-belts that run on adjustable pulleys sized      to provide a speed increase of 2.54:1.    </p>    <p>      The generator itself is actually a 50-HP, three-phase      induction motor that-since only two of its "legs" are      used-is run as a 30-HP, single-phase generator. It      was purchased used, but entirely rebuilt, for only $500 . .      . a price that represents a saving of about a thousand      dollars when compared with that of a new synchronous      generator.    </p>    <p>      Besides its low cost, the induction generator has another      very useful property. When operated as a motor, it receives      power from the grid and spins somewhat slower than the      standard synchronous speed of 1,800 RPM (this difference is      known as its slip speed). But if the induction motor is      driven to the slip speed above 1,800 RPM, it begins to      generate power. Furthermore, at that point the utility      line's signal still regulates the voltage and frequency of      the power being delivered (a process called grid      excitation), so no complicated and expensive speed control      is needed to insure that generator and utility stay in      phase.    </p>    <p>      There are, however, a number of protective circuits needed      to make the two-way hydro/utility hookup safe. The Laurel      Creek control panel-the design for which was donated      by an electrical engineer, Richard Suhre-includes      over-and undervoltage relays, a frequency relay, and      a starter used for getting the system up to speed. In      addition, because the generator depends on the power      company's grid for voltage and frequency regulation, it was      necessary to devise a way to shut down the plant in the      event of utility failure. (This also protects any power      company workers from being shocked by water-generated      electricity when they're repairing defective utility      wires.)    </p>    <p>      The arrangement the team developed consists of a simple,      fail-safe bypass that diverts water from the turbine in the      event of a power failure. During normal operation, a valve      in the diverter pipe is held closed by compressed air and a      solenoid. But if grid power is lost, the solenoid      automatically kicks open . . . releasing the air, opening      the valve, and thus allowing the water to go around the      turbine. When it's time to start up again, the diverter      valve is closed, with the help of either a footoperated      pump or a small compressor.    </p>    <p>      Two meters monitor Laurel Creek Hydro's performance. One      unit registers the amount of power consumed at the site for      lighting, compressor operation, etc., and the other      measures the current going back into the grid. Of course,      the former reading indicates the electricity charged out at      BREMCO's retail rate, and the latter refers to that paid      back at the contract price of about 3 cents per KWH. (This      two-meter method is the most common utility-accepted      arrangement.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE DO-IT-YOURSELF CONTINGENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Thousands of hours of volunteer labor went into the      construction of Laurel Creek Hydroelectric, and this "sweat      equity" was vital to the project's maintaining an      attractive "bottom line". However, careful selection of      materials and equipment also played a big part in keeping      costs down.    </p>    <p>      For example, Andy and Bob built the powerhouse from      recycled timbers and roughcut siding in order to save on      lumber costs. They also made such components as the      equipment lifts, the turbine housing, the belt guards, and      the control box . . . instead of purchasing them. At the      intake end, no more ready-mix concrete than necessary was      used. The dam was tied to bedrock with rebar . . . poured .      . . then covered with hand-laid rock.    </p>    <p>      The group also showed considerable ingenuity in dealing      with the often tricky problems of pipe mounting. The top      three supports are made of reinforced concrete and rock,      but those down the remainder of the run consist of      hand-split locust poles. The posts were pounded into the      ground with'a wooden sledge, and the pipe was lashed to      them with cable. At one point, where the penstock had to      span a small ravine at a height of 7 feet, several pairs of      thick locust poles were set in concrete to support the      needed bridge.    </p>    <p>      The secure mounting of the pipe is particularly important      in a high-head hydro site because of a potential problem      called "pipe hammer". This disturbance can occur if a valve      is inadvertently shut off too quickly . . . it's akin to      the banging that sometimes takes place when a tap is closed      in a poorly plumbed house. However, whereas "faucet rattle"      is merely annoying, even minor pipe hammer in a hydropower      penstock can easily destroy a poorly mounted system.    </p>    <p>      Another disaster that had to be guarded against was pipe      implosion, which can be caused by the vacuum created behind      water flowing from a pipe with its intake closed. To      prevent such a calamity, Andy and Bob installed an air      bleed near the top of the penstock. A 3"-diameter polybutyl      pipe is connected to the 8"-diameter plastic and runs      uphill to a point 10 feet above the intake. Thus no water      can escape through the tube, but air can be drawn in if      necessary.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINANCES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Dr. Ayers estimates that, if the group hadn't saved money      through the use of donated labor and careful equipment      selection, the finished price for the site could have      totaled more than $50,000. He hastens to add that one      cannot, today, hire an engineering firm to develop a plant      of this size and expect to make a profit.    </p>    <p>      As it stands, though, the ratio of dollars invested to KW      capacity is quite favorable at Laurel Creek. With just      short of $22,000 spent and a delivered output of 17.5 KW,      the price per KW is well under the widely accepted      guideline of $1,500. In fact, as a point of reference,      Laurel Creek Hydroelectric was put on line for less money      per KW than it costs a utility company to build a      coal-powered plant.    </p>    <p>      In purely economic terms, the generator will deliver an      average of about 132,000 KWH to BREMCO each year, bringing      in a gross income of about $4,000 annually. (This figure      will, of course, rise as electric rates go up.) Maintenance      should be minimal-including bearing lubrication, belt      dressing, trash rack cleaning, and inspection-so the      major expense to be considered is capital. If the money      used for Laurel Creek's construction had been borrowed at      prevailing rates (which, of course, it was not . . . being      a grant), the system would net about $200 each year (and      more as rates rise) for ten years, at which point it would      be paid off: From that time until the end of equipment      life-a minimum of ten years more-the income      produced by the site would be largely profit.    </p>    <p>      Still, the most difficult aspect of developing a      microhydropower site-beyond acquiring or getting      access to the necessary expertise-is raising the      money. Grants similar to that which provided Laurel Creek      Hydroelectric's source of capital have dried up with the      "new austerity", and the possibility of federally backed      loans is doubtful (the mechanism is there but no funding      has yet been provided). And since the costs will run at      least $1,000 per KW of capacity, the total sum would add up      to more than most folks' savings accounts. Furthermore,      banks are likely to be reluctant to make loans, simply      because the concept of a profitable small-scale      power-generating facility is so unfamiliar. For now,      sites such as Laurel Creek offer the best references you      can provide to lenders.    </p>    <p>      Finally, unless you're lucky enough to find one of those      increasingly rare "small hydro" sites (the DOE's      designation for those between 100 and 3,000 KW), you're not      likely to be able to retire on your miniutility's income.      Yet there are tens of thousands of locations along small      streams in the U.S. that could be developed profitably, and      their net power production might well eliminate the need      for several nuclear plants. (For example, in a 24-county      area of western North Carolina alone, it's been estimated      that there may be as much as 10,000,000 watts of potential      . . . enough to supply several thousand households.)    </p>    <p>      A few years ago, experts interested in very small      hydroelectric site development were concerned with the      question of whether developers could afford to build such      installations. The question that's more frequently heard      today is, "Can we afford not to build them?"    </p>
