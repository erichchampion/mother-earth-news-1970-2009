        		    		<p>		strong> The Institute for Local Self-Reliance    works to help urban residents gain greater control ever their    lives through the use of low-technology, decentralist tools    and concepts. Because we believe that city dwellers and    country folks alike can profit from the institute's admirable    efforts, we've made this "what's happening where" report by    the ILSR staffers one of MOTHER's regular features. If you    would like to know more, you can have a free catalog of    ILSR's selection of books and pamphlets by ending the    institute a self-addressed, stamped envelope . . . or become    an associate member or a tax-deductible $35 per year ($50 for    intitutions) and receive both a periodic report on the    institute's work and a 20% discount on all the group's    publications. Write to ILSR, Dept. TMEN, 1717 18th Street    N.W., Washngton, D.C. 20009.</p><p> Ironically, the same    administration that claims to support local    self-reliance-and he delegation of authority from    federal to state and community levels-is actually    centralizing authority and preventing local self-reliance    when it comes to such issues as nuclear energy.</p><p> Recently, New    York City enacted legislation that prohibited the transport    of nuclear materials within the city limits. Concerned over    the possibly disastrous effects of-and he potential    for-accidents involving vehicles carrying such    substances on local thoroughfares, the city council believed    that it was exercising a clear right.</p><p> But the federal    government disagreed . . . and so the United States    Department of Transportation sued the city, arguing that    nuclear power is a national issue, and therefore the federal    government alone has authority to regulate operations    (including the transport of materials). Fortunately, the    courts decided otherwise . . . and upheld the Big Apple's    legislation.</p><p> Recent battles over the issue of nuclear waste    storage serve as yet further examples of the current    administration's "forked tongue" when it comes to conflicts    between local selfdetermination and nuclear power.</p><p> Several    years ago, storage sites for radioactive waste were    established-by federal mandate-for broad regions    of the country. Generally, these sites are located in    politically conservative, and largely pronuclear, states . .    . such as South Carolina, Nevada, Washington, and Utah.</p><p> But    the lack of certainty over the longterm security of existing    storage techniques has caused even these states to express    concern about dump sites. Last summer, for example, Governor    Matheson of Utah told the federal government that-until    an environmental impact statement could be    developed-he'd do his best to stop any further attempts    by the administration to establish a dump in that state's    Canyonlands National Park. (EDITOR'S NOTE: For further    information on this issue, see the Friends of the Earth    column on page 106.]</p><p> Also, in August, Nevada's Department of    Environmental Protection voted 4 to 1 to close its existing    waste dump, leaving only two remaining sites-one in    Washington and the other in South Carolina-in the    country. But the Sagebrush State may well run into the same    trouble Washington encountered last year when its legislature    made a similar move to ban further dumping: The United States    sued, and the courts upheld the federal government's    preemption of local authority.</p>		<p>		Nuclear power and democracy are, apparently, incompatible.		</p>		<p>		However, the contradiction between the administration's stated philosophy and actual    deeds is not confined to the issue of nuclear energy. For    example, at the time of this writing (early September), a    bill is wending its way through Congress that will-if    passed-give coal companies the right to seize private    property on which to build coal-slurry pipelines. The firms    argue that the pipelines would reduce the cost of    transporting coal, thereby lowering the price of electricity.</p><p>    But should coal firms-or any corporate entities, for    that matter-be awarded the power to confiscate a    person's property? As you probably know, that right was given    to utility companies years ago . . . for generations, now,    they've been allowed to take over private land on which they    plan to build transmission lines. There was little resistance    to the policy at first. But as the country grew, the wires    carried higher and higher voltages and the towers became    taller . . . and residents-fearing that the magnetic    fields surrounding the crackling lines might damage the    health of humans and animals-began to voice their    opposition.</p><p> In fact, some years back, a virtual war broke out    between local citizens and powerline construction workers in    Minnesota. Farmers shot out glass insulators and overturned    towers . . . and eventually the FBI was called in and built    guard posts every few hundred yards along the construction    sites, to protect the crews and equipment.</p><p> Of course,    American history is fraught with examples of the tug-of-war    between political philosophy and the demands of technology.    Thomas Jefferson once envisioned the U.S. as a democratic    nation based on the independent landowning farmer. Toward the    end of his life, though, Jefferson had reluctantly accepted    the economic value of big cities and altered his political    vision of America: Our system could no longer be based on    one-to-one democracy . . . instead, the country would have a    centralized representative government.</p><p> Now, we seem to beat    another such turning point in our history. Local    self-reliance is a philosophy that carries with it a    technical dynamic. The machines with which we surround our    lives, the productive capacity we strive to build, can    promote our independence . . . or undermine it. If, in fact,    the Reagan administration is correct-that is, if the    people of this country really do want decentralization of    authority and responsibility-then all of us, including    our leaders, will have to rethink our current dependence on    technologies that by their very nature belie that democratic    yearning.		</p>
