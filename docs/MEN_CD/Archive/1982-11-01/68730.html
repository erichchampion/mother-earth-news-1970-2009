    <p>
                <p>      The frost-crisped carpet of leaves crunches underfoot in      the morning chill, but midday sometimes still brings a wan      reminder of the heat of summer's sun. The harvest is now      concluded, and the garden begins its long (and much de      served) winter's sleep. Draw the family together in a feast      of thanksgiving for the year's gifts of goodness.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Peter Hemingson    </h5>        <p>      Very often the gifts people appreciate most are things that      they've always wanted but haven't been able to justify      purchasing. Whether price or the lack of a really pressing      need is the sticking point, such objects are often on our      dream lists, tantalizingly just beyond practical reach.    </p>    <p>      I'd always felt that way about a particular spading fork .      . . a beautiful heavyduty Bulldog model with a forged steel      head and a smooth handle of ash. The tool looked      magnificent . . . but it was priced at about $40, and I      already had a perfectly good spading fork (although each      time I used it, the business end grew a little more      snaggle-toothed). Then a birthday came along, and out in      the garden I found-festooned with ribbons-a      spanking new Bulldog fork.    </p>    <p>      I loved that implement at first try, and I learned      something important from using it, too: All those old saws      like "cheap is dear" and "always buy quality tools" are      good advice! Not only was my Bulldog strong of shaft and      straight of tooth when it was new, but it has stayed that      way. The tool I thought was too expensive looks as if it      will outlive me . . . where-as previously I was in the      habit of buying a new spading fork every couple of years!    </p>    <p>      So-as the holidays approach and the scramble for      "just the right gift" begins-let's take a look at      some basic, quality garden implements. They'll make perfect      gifts, and then go on to prove their worth in the garden .      . . year after year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STARTING SMALL</strong>    </p>    <p>      The hand tools that are used for planting, transplanting,      and cultivating get more use than does just about any other      garden equipment, so it's especially important that these      little implements be sturdy. (It's pretty irritating to      have the shaft of your trowel bend 45Â° as you try to      lever a rock out of the soil!)    </p>    <p>      When purchasing a trowel, cultivator, garden fork, or      transplanter, then, look for one that's forged from a      single piece of rust-resistant (or rustproof) metal.      Welded-together models tend to break . . . maybe not today,      perhaps not tomorrow, but eventually. Heft the tool before      you buy it, too . . . if it doesn't sit comfortably in your      hand in the store, it won't be any better in the garden.    </p>    <p>      Walt Nicke's Heavy Duty Digger Trowels (access information      for all of the tools mentioned appears at the end of this      section) are each made from a single piece of thick steel,      are pointed and have sharpened edges, and sport easy-to-see      (and comfortable) red plastic hand grips. There are several      models, all under $8.00. Nicke also carries a Sheffield      steel trowel with a socket that's wrapped around and      riveted to a hardwood handle (under $8.00) . . . and the      Osborne No. 211, with blade and shank forged from a single      piece of steel (under $10).    </p>    <p>      Smith & Hawken offers a wood-handled garden trowel with      a forged blade that the firm guarantees against falling      apart, bending, or failing its user in any way (Model 1031,      under $10). The same firm also has a beautiful trowel      forged from stainless steel (Model 1038, approximately      $25).    </p>    <p>      Both Smith & Hawken and Brookstone sell sets composed      of a trowel, a hand fork, and a transplanter . . . all made      of die-cast aluminum and featuring trigger grips and molded      indentations for the thumb. These rust-free tools cost less      than $25. Nicke offers castaluminum trowels-regular      and transplanter-that won't break, bend, or rust      (about $7.00 each). Finally, Brookstone has a featherweight      hand hoe with a one-piece blade that's been hardened and      tempered to Rockwell C-40 specifications (approximately      $11).    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRUNE LIKE THE PROS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Pruning shears are also both widely used and usually      subject to a fair amount of abuse. This cutting implement      is offered in two major types: bypass and anvil. The bypass      shears, which work like scissors, are used for fine pruning      and can make cuts flush to a stem. The anvil variety, which      has a blade that cut's down onto a soft metal block, is a      little more rugged, but-since it can't trim as      closely as does the bypass-it often leaves stubs that      may become infected.    </p>    <p>      Each type has its virtues, of course, but if you're going      to buy just one pair of shears, I'd suggest a bypass model.      And the best of them, as far as I'm concerned is the      Swiss-made Felco. These shears rear; of taken apart for      sharpening, and they have replaceable blades as well.    </p>    <p>      The Felco Model 2 (it will put you back about $26) is the      most popular, but lefthanded gardeners will be interested      in the Model 9 (this snipper can be had for about $27),      which is designed for southpaws.    </p>    <p>      Each of these sturdy shears is available from Nicke, Smith      & Hawken, and A.M. Leonard (whose catalog also lists      all the replacement parts).    </p>    <p>      <strong>FORKS, SPADES, SHOVELS, AND HOES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The tool of choice for nearly every large-scale      soilstirring task except doubledigging is generally the      spading fork. I've found my four-tined digger to be just      about the most useful implement in my toolshed . . . and      I've already spilled the beans on my choice here: Smith      & Hawken's Heavy Duty Bulldog Garden Fork (around $40).      If your digging is confined to a mellow organic patch with      few rocks, you could save some bucks and get by with the      Medium Garden Fork (around $35). For hardpan and caliche,      on the other hand, Smith & Hawken has a stalwart model      that's attached to its handle with brawny straps of steel      (under $50). The firm claims that it's the strongest garden      fork in the world! And what, you may well ask, makes a      Bulldog tool so good? Well, its one-piece head is forged      from carbon/manganese steel . . . it's attached to the      handle by a solid socket teas part of the head . . . and      the handle itself is fine northern ash.    </p>    <p>      For trenching and removing soil from a planting hole, or      tackling the initial steps of preparing a biodynamic/      French intensive double-dug bed, a spade-not a      shovel-is the tool to use. (In case you don't know      the difference, a spade is a digger with an oblong blade      that can easily be sharpened . . . while a shovel usually      has a curved blade and is designed to scoop up and      transport material.) The sharpened blade of the spade makes      it an ideal tool for cutting through underground roots,      edging gardens, removing sod, and even cultivating. I      particularly like Smith & Hawken's Bulldog Garden Spade      (under $35) and Heavy Duty Garden Spade (around $40) . . .      the line of professional Nursery Spades from Leonard (about      $35 to $50) . . . and Mellinger's Lightweight Molybdenum      Spades (approximately $45).    </p>    <p>      Hoes have been used for cultivating for centuries, and one      of the best I know of is called the Scovil Hoe . . . named      after the company that has been making it for the last 195      years! This tool doesn't rely on a simple rod-and-ferrule      arrangement to secure the head to the shaft. Instead, the      head (which is forged from a single piece of high-carbon      steel) has an integral ring through which the shaft passes.      The implements are available from Nicke (the Uncle Sam,      about $13), Leonard (the American Pattern G6, about $21),      and Smith & Hawken (Model 6201, about $20).    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPECIAL TOOLS FOR SPECIAL PEOPLE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Some tools are extra special .. . they make gardening      possible for folks who-because of a physical      infirmity-might not otherwise be able to enjoy such      work. A handy brochure on adaptive garden tools has been      published by the Berkshire Garden Center, and may be      obtained by sending 25 cents and a self-addressed; stamped      envelope (Massachusetts residents add 2 cents tax) to      Berkshire Garden Center, Dept. TMEN, Routes 102 and 183,      Stockbridge, Massachusetts 01262. And two good sources of      tools for the disabled are Walt Nicke (address below) and      the Gardens for All Toolshed (Dept. TMEN, 180 Flynn Avenue,      Burlington, Vermont 05401). The GFA folks will send you a      sample copy of their news magazine, which lists the tools      available through them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACCESS TO TOOLS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Brookstone Company<br />      Dept.

TMEN, 1570 Pacheco Street. Santa Fe, New Mexico      87501 . . . catalog $ 1.00). As its name suggests, the book      does list seeds for regional specialties, including Boleta      and Tepari beans, chiles, pozole corn, cilantro, epazote,      and Navajo tea. But it also features wild flower meadow      mixes pre pared for areas from coast to coast and border to      border . . . a fascinating flowerbreeder's special for      genetics hobbyists (which includes seeds of nine species of      Pentstemon and five of Oenothera to experiment with) . . .      a collection of wildflowers that are guaranteed attractive      to hummingbirds . . . a dye plant special with a dozen      different kinds of seeds, as well as a copy of the Brooklyn      Botanic Garden's Dyeing With Plants handbook . . . and      numerous sensible (and often sensitive) ruminations on      gardening and natural landscaping. This is one of those      rare catalogs that (thanks to the quantity and quality of      information it contains) transcends its ) transcendsits      original reason for existence. In short it's a keeper.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE GARDENER'S BOOKSHELF</strong>    </p>    <p>      A number of gardening books arrived at our mailbox recently      . . . so, still buried in press releases and shipping bags,      we have the following to report.    </p>    <p>      HP Books (Dept. TMEN, Box 5367, Tucson, Arizona 85703)      offers Southern Home Landscaping by Ken Smith ($7.95 at      bookstores, or add $1.00 for postage and order it from the      publisher). Written specifically for readers in the 15      southern states from Maryland to Texas, this beautifully      illustrated largeformat paperback covers landscape design,      planting methods, soil preparation, weed control (watch out      here ... herbicides are recommended!), sprinkler systems,      and garden construction projects. Smith also discusses the      best lawn grass varieties for differing climates, and      evaluates shrubs and trees. For those interested in      traditional landscaping ideas, this book could be a good      first reference.    </p>    <p>      Our friends up north at Garden Way have decided that the      super guides Dick and Jan Raymond wrote for Gardens for All      should be available to other folks, too, so they've drawn      together nearly a dozen of the manuals under a single      title: Home Gardening Wisdom ($9.95 at bookstores, or by      mail-add $1.00 for shipping and handling-from Garden      Way, Dept. TMEN, 2505 Ferry Road, Charlotte, Vermont      05445). The hefty pa perback deals with 55 vegetables      altogether . . . and provides information about suggested      varieties, seed starting, transplanting, disease problems      and insects (both organic and chemical solutions are      offered), harvesting, and (this is Jan's particular      bailiwick) canning and cooking. The text is nicely      integrated (you can, for instance, follow a tomato from      seed to stew), the advice is sound, and the pace is right.    </p>
