                    <p>      In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of humankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department. " "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced      our still-standing offer: Anyone who sends us a short      account of an actual barter that gets printed in this      column (write THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) 105 Stoney      Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791) will      receive a 12-month subscription (new or extended) to      MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Two years ago my wife and I decided to act on our      long-cherished plan to move to the country. So-to the      dismay of some of out less adventuresome friends and      relatives-we packed up all our belongings, piled our      three young city-bred children into the car, and headed off      to our new home.    </p>    <p>      And having lived for several years in the somewhat "boxed"      environment of an urban area, we were immediately struck by      the spaciousness-and beauty-of our rural      surroundings. The rolling fields of hay and corn rippled      gracefully in the wind as if to greet us, making us feel      that this area truly was "God's country"!    </p>    <p>      Our first winter on the "farm" was spent studying books and      magazines (including MOM, of course) on the how-to's of      wholistic gardening, animal husbandry, and numerous other      aspects of self-reliant living. So by the time the first      crocuses peeked through the snow, we were ready (we      thought) to put some of those ideas into practice. We began      by buying two goats and a batch of baby chicks . . . and      later acquired two feeder pigs and a pair of domestic      rabbits. As we'd expected, purchasing our menagerie of      critters put a crimp in our pocketbook, but it wasn't until      after several trips to the feed store that we began to      realize just how expensive caring for livestock can be.    </p>    <p>      We considered trying to put a stop to our diminishing      returns by growing our own animal fodder. However, we      didn't have access to a tractor or other tilling equipment,      so even though we could afford the seed and fertilizer, we      had no means of preparing the soil (handtilling four acres      wasn't exactly an undertaking we wanted to experience).    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, while discussing our predicament with a      neighbor, we discovered that he had a "retired" tractor and      a plow attachment stored in his barn. Well, with my      knowledge of basic mechanics, it took only a short while to      get the clunker in good enough shape to plant the fields.      Our swap worked out perfectly for both parties, too. In      exchange for an afternoon of my labor, my wife and I now      have a corncrib full of winter feed for our animals . . .      and our farmer friend has a usable tractor again.      Furthermore, we plan to continue to trade my me chamical      know-how for free use of the machine . . . and we might      find a few other "retired" items in that barn that could      use some repair, too!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>J.K.<br />      Wisconsin</strong></em>    </p>		<p>		Hoping to eventually become self-reliant homesteaders by    running a Christmas tree farm, my husband and I left our    secure jobs near Baltimore eight years ago and bought land in    rural Virginia. Over the first few years we planted our pines    . . . built a log cabin . . . and put in big, productive    gardens. Friends and neighboring farmers were intrigued by    our rough, wooden home    and-surprisingly-complimented us on our    learn-as-you-go interior work. In fact, it wasn't long before    we were bartering our amateur skills for livestock.		</p>    <p>      For example, we accepted wallpapering, painting, and      plaster-repairing jobs in exchange for young heifers. Two      more calves (bringing our herd to 11) were added as payment      for pasturing a neighboring farmer's cattle during a summer      drought. We later purchased a bull (that was the only cash      outlay required to build up our stock) . . . and now we      auction off about ten yearlings every spring. If all goes      well, we expect these cows to provide most of our income      for about ten more years.    </p>    <p>      However, now that the pines are of salable size, a new      avenue of exchange has opened. Last December the local      veterinarian cut his Christmas evergreen from our stand      and-in return-our horse got a "free" tetanus      shot. Two other customers "paid" for their yule trees with      pecan nuts and homemade sausage.    </p>    <p>      I wonder what riches (and new acquaintances) this Christmas      season's barters will bring?    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>L. W.<br />      Virginia</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      We found a way to enjoy a tropical vacation for very little      money. Our story began when we placed an ad in a Florida      newspaper, stating that we'd like to swap lodging in our      New York-state house for similar privileges in an abode in      the Sunshine State. The idea was to offer two weeks of      funfilled snowy weather to some southern travelers in      exchange for 14 days of sunshine and warm beaches for our      clan.    </p>    <p>      The advertisement generated a number of responses . . . and      among the replies was a letter that included a picture of a      family posed in front of their house. Upon further      correspondence with those folks, we discovered that the      couple had two children about the same age as our      youngsters. We continued to write for three months prior to      the decided "swapping date", so when we met halfway (in      Virginia) to exchange house keys, it was as if we were      seeing old friends.    </p>    <p>      Thanks to bartering we were saved the hassle of finding      someone to house-sit dur ing our absence. We were also able      to leave our children's toys at home (thus conserving space      in the car), since we knew that there would be plenty of      appropriate playthings at our "new" house. We even had the      convenience of employing our friends' regular babysitter      (after all, dependable help is mighty hard to find in a      strange town). And the $400 we saved in lodging expenses      certainly isn't to be scoffed at, either.    </p>    <p>      Our family sunned and swam for two glorious weeks . . .      while our friends skiied, skated, and sledded to their      hearts' content. The arrangement worked out so well, in      fact, that we've decided to swap again this coming January!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>P.Z.<br />      New York</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Whenever I think of swapping, I think of Christmas . . .      because trading enables my husband and me to make our      holiday season all the more festive. My spouse, you see,      fixes appliances for the owner of an antique store. Now the      old-timey items in that shop set our hearts a-racing, but      our wallets really put a brake on any spending. However, by      bartering our skills for goods, we're able to indulge in      our hobby and save our cash.    </p>    <p>      Here's how we do it: The store owner keeps a tab of what he      owes us for fixing his gadgets . . . and at the end of the      year my mate and I go on a shopping spree . . . picking out      antiques until the value of our gathered items equals the      repair work bill.    </p>    <p>      Swapping puts glitter in our life in other ways, as well.      For instance, our jeweler is able to keep his home      appliances in good running order by fixing our watches and      jewelry whenever they need it.    </p>    <p>      Season's Greetings! May the coming year bring you good      health, good cheer, and some good trading opportunities!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>L. K.<br />      Indiana</strong></em>    </p>
