                    <p>      If you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful      home business that was inspired by an article you read in      MOTHER, tell us about it in around 500 words (write to THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , 105 Stoney Mountain Road,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791): Be sure to mention      when and where you started your venture and with how much      "seed money"; what you make (net), and anything else that      might be of assistance to other entrepreneurs. If your      story is used in this column, you'll receive [1] the      satisfaction of knowing that you may help someone else      start a business and [2] a free two-year new or renewal      subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .    </p>    <p>      Last Christmas I was short of cash . . . and, while in a      quandary as to just how to earn some extra money, a friend      and I rented a table at a local bazaar without having first      decided what to sell! Somehow, though, our "cart before the      horse" method actually turned out for the best: You see,      while skimming THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) (No. 69, page      30), I came across Julie Driscoll's article about making      garden row markers. I knew right away that I liked the idea      and figured that if a youngster could do it, so (probably)      could I!    </p>    <p>      After receiving a gift of wood scraps from a carpenter      friend, I set to work and made ten sets of five vegetables      each .. . all painted with bright colors and happy faces. I      found the activity delightful, and was all the more pleased      because I was turning out (I believed) a definitely salable      product.    </p>    <p>      Sure enough, I took five sets of markers to the bazaar on      each of the event's two days, and sold them all. Each bunch      went for $20, and the rented table and the paint cost me      $50, so I came out $150 ahead!    </p>    <p>      Now carving vegetable markers to sell at a bazaar may seem      like a small step toward entrepreneurship to most, but to      me it was remarkable: My first attempt at making something      to sell provided me with fun, profit, and a sense of pride.      I'm in the process of producing more garden ornaments to      market in the spring (when people are thinking hard about      growing their summer food, and some of them are wondering      just how to label those neat rows of green shoots more      clearly and attractively).    </p>    <p>      It feels great to be able to earn my own pocket money . . .      to express more creativity than I'd ever thought I had . .      . and to give pleasure to the gardeners who buy my wares.    </p>		<p>		<strong>Joyce A. Gardella<br />    North Pole, Alaska</strong>		</p>        <p>      George and I started homesteading here in Vermont in the      first half of the 70's-with a lot of help from John      and Sally Seymour's book Farming for Self-Sufficiency,      which was serialized in MOTHER NOS. 25-41 and 43-and      we soon saw we could make it with just a little financial      boost.    </p>    <p>      Well, I'd been feeling really guilty when ever I took time      out to go riding . . . and I figured I could ease my      conscience and solve our money problems if I could make my      pleasure time pay! After exploring a few alternatives, we      decided to turn our place into a guest ranch.    </p>    <p>      Our initial investment included the cost of building a new      stable ($2,000), buying used tack ($550), and purchasing      horses ($3,500). We were also given six horses . . . an      almost unbelievable piece of good fortune! And, of course,      we spent a lot of time and energy sprucing up the      homestead.    </p>    <p>      Now, people who want to ride the lovely trails and dirt      roads of the Green Mountains can stay here for a week or      more. We saddle up right after breakfast and ride until      it's time to stop for a late lunch. After that we groom the      horses . . . train and play with the most recent crop of      colts . . . garden, canbe, swim, hike, and so forth. I      don't have to feel guilty (after all, I'm working), and I'm      bringing in dollars. We charge our guests $195 a week,      including room, board, and all activities. And occasionally      a visitor will fall in love with one of our beautiful.      registered Morgans and buy the animal.    </p>    <p>      All in all, we gross about $3,500 a year from guests and      about $4,000 on sales of young stock. And when that is      added to our other farm income, we do all right! If you'd      like to come ride with us, call 802/453-2893, or drop us a      line.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>George & Ruth Strickholm<br />      Lincoln Mountain Farm<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      Lincoln, Vt. 05443</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Being a home- and garden-oriented, child-loving      MOTHER-type, I spent a long time searching for one of those      rare enterprises that would [1] allow me to work my own      hours, [2] let me stay at home with my children, [3] pay      reasonably well, and [4] be thoroughly enjoyable. Well,      though that sounded like an impossible job description to      fill, my wheatgrass juice business has met every one of      those dream criteria.    </p>    <p>      Lack of garden space prevented me from raising flowers and      vegetables for local markets . . . which would have been my      first oc cupational choice. So I busied myself looking for      an alternative. I found my answer in evysmith and Jane S.      Gray's "Sprouts Fill Our Pockets With Cash" (MOTHER NO. 54,      page 64). Growing sprouts wouldn't require more than a      corner of my valuable yard space, and yet it would allow      me-in effect-to "garden" for my needed income. The local      grocery store, I found upon inquiry, was already well      supplied with several kinds of sprouts . . . but it did      have a market for a steady supply of wheatgrass juice, a      sweet healthful drink made from the tender young shoots of      wheat sprouts. I started out slowly, at first simply      growing and juicing the wheatgrass for my family and      neighbors (it's almost as easy, I soon discovered, to make      enough for a crowd as it is to prepare a sample for an      individual), but before long I expanded my operation to      make enough for the market as well.    </p>    <p>      I built a small greenhouse (about 5' X 5' X 5') from scrap      lumber, using an old framed window for the roof, large      clear plastic bags for the sides, and a discarded bamboo      curtain for the front (in other words, the structure didn't      cost me anything but time). The curtain and some nearby      shrubbery provided the partial shade necessary for the      young grass.    </p>    <p>      Luck stayed with me: I bought a juicer, at a flea market,      for $3.00. The other necessary purchases included      containers from a restaurant supplier (200 for $5.30),      blank labels from the stationery store (500 for $3.00), a      rubber stamp with content information on it ($5.25), and      ten pounds of wheat berries ($2.80). My total start-up cost      was $19.35.    </p>    <p>      I began by selling a dozen ounces a day (at 55 cents an      ounce), seven days a week, and those deliveries quickly      disappeared . . . allowing me to increase my sales to 18      ounces a day. (My expenses run about 7 cents per ounce.) It      takes me about two hours a day to start the flats of      sprouting wheat, prepare the compost it's grown in, juice      the grass, and clean up. My work schedule is flexible . . .      that is, all the chores except the juicing can be done any      time that I'm not busy with my children, though I do have a      commitment to take the product to market as the store opens      each morning. I deliver by bicycle, so my transportation      costs are negligible. Furthermore, the store is only half a      mile from home . . . and while I'm there, I make a point to      do any necessary shopping.    </p>    <p>      My income from the wheatgrass juice business now provides      food-and occasional extras-for a family of      four, and running the enterprise certainly adds variety to      my life. Be sure, though, to check your county health codes      before setting up a similar enterprise of your own. Some      local authorities may treat the activity as "food      processing", which generally requires special insurance,      permits, etc.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to learn more about wheatgrass and its      juice-how to produce and use the beverage, what's in      it, and what it does toward health and healing-my      pamphlet on the subject is available for $1.00 plus a      self-addressed, stamped envelope.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Pam Prescott<br />      Dept.
