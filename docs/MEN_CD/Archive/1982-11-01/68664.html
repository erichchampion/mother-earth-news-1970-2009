                <p>      "The art of...travel, and indeed all adventure, is the art      of being bold enough to enjoy life now." (W.H. Murray)    </p>        <p>      Many issues back, we warned readers that there would      probably never be a better time to see the world with      MOTHER, as the cost of travel was destined to climb.      Sadly-and despite our efforts to hold prices down      while still offering memorable, and educational,      tours-this prediction has (with a few exceptions)      come true. On the other hand, the dollar is currently      stronger than usual against many foreign currencies, but      even this financial break is likely to be temporary . . .      while airfares continue on a never-ending upward spiral.      So, again, we feel there's no time like the present to      indulge your wanderlust.    </p>           <p>      What's more, MOTHER'S trips offer a whole lot for the money      (In fact, we have some super bargains!) And in addition to      organizing thoughtfully selected and carefully planned      journeys, we provide opportunities for you to share your      experiences with some especially interesting, like-minded      folks. As one world traveler remarked during the final days      of our spectacular and eventful river rafting adventure in      Alaska, "You know, this whole trip has been great, but it's      the people who've made it so special!"    </p>    <p>      We hope you'll be "bold enough" to join and enjoy one of      our remarkable overseas adventures . . . now.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN ENERGY-CONSCIOUS HAWAII</strong>    </p>    <p>      In order to accommodate different interests and budgets,      Jordan College, our cosponsor on this trip, has put      together three different options for our Hawaii Energy Tour      (December 6 to 13, 1982).    </p>    <p>      For $948, you can take a two-island alternative-energy      excursion of Oahu and Hawaii that-besides including      the usual opportunities for sightseeing-will show you      the advances being made there in wind and solar power,      aquaculture, hydropower, ocean thermal energy conversion,      and biomass and ethanol production. Or you can take a      similar energy tour of Oahu alone for only $848, and have      several days left to relax and explore on your own.      Finally, if you'd simply like to take advantage of our low      group travel rates, we're offering a visit to Oahu (without      the guided tours) for $698.    </p>    <p>      All prices quoted are for Chicago departures (you can also      leave from New York or the West Coast) and include airfare,      hotels, and breakfasts. But send in your $200 deposit for      this trip right away, as time is short!    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOUTH SEAS ECOLOGY</strong>    </p>    <p>      The wisdom that Paul and Anne Ehrlich bring to you via      their Ecoscience column represents, of course, only a      fraction of their work concerning our sweet and delicate      planet. And if you add the Ehrlichs' discernment to that of      their colleagues, John and Cheryl Holdren, you have one of      the finest gatherings of scientific minds (and gracious      personalities!) around.    </p>    <p>      On our second South Seas Seminar (January 23 to February 5,      1983), you'll have a chance to tap into this wisdom on a      personal basis. There-on the Polynesian islands of      Tahiti, Bora Bora, Huahine, and Rangiroa-we'll spend      our mornings snorkeling in crystal-clear waters, while our      tour leaders reveal the intricate ecology of the fragile      submerged gardens that surround these tropical jewels. Your      afternoons will be free to help in underwater research or      to explore these island hideaways and their largely      unchanged cultures. And each evening, the Ehrlichs and the      Holdrens will lecture on environmental subjects of      worldwide importance.    </p>    <p>      The cost for this South Seas winter getaway-including      airfare, hotels, breakfasts, and dinners-is $2,495      from Los Angeles . . . and $200 will reserve a place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SPLENDID HIMALAYAN SPRING</strong>    </p>    <p>      "As I stepped out on my first day's march in the Himalayas,      a strange exhilaration thrilled me. I kept squeezing my      fists together and saying emphatically to myself and to the      universe at large: `Oh yes! Oh yes! This really is      splendid! How splendid! How splendid!' " So wrote Francis      Younghusband after a 1924 trek in Nepal.    </p>    <p>      This exotic region still produces just such awe-inspiring      impressions for those who invest the time and energy to      explore it . . . and our Himalayan Spring Spectacular, set      for March 12 to April 1, 1983 (the season during which the      giant rhododendron trees are in bloom), offers as diverse a      sampling of the area as possible. After a visit to      Kathmandu, we'll trek a little-known route overlooking the      great massifs of Annapurna and Manaslu (both of which are      over 26,000 feet high) and then raft the Trisuli River down      to the Royal Chitwan National Park for wildlife viewing      from elephantback.    </p>    <p>      The price of this excursion (which we guarantee will be one      of the most unforgettable experiences of your whole life!)      is $2,750, which includes airfare from New York and all      other expenses except for a few meals . . . and the      shopper's bargains you won't be able to resist in      Kathmandu.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A VERY SPECIAL JAPANESE JOURNEY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Almost everywhere you go in Japan-even in the patios      of stores and hidden behind house walls-you'll find      exquisite, serene little gardens. Though these plots are      stunning in their simplicity, the horticultural practices      that produce them are unique in the world and still very      much a mystery to most American gardeners.    </p>    <p>      We are fortunate, then, to have Dr. John L.      Creech-one of the Western world's top experts on this      subtle form of garden design and cultivation-as the      leader of our Study Tour of the Plants and Gardens of Japan      (April 21 to May 12, 1983). Better yet, because of his long      acquaintance with Japanese authorities in this field, he's      able to gain access to some private gardens seldom seen by      other visitors to this country. In addition, this trip has      been carefully timed to catch these living works of art in      all their spring glory.    </p>    <p>      The all-inclusive price (airfare from San Francisco, top      Japanese hotels, and all meals) is $3,795, and a $300      deposit will hold your place on a true botanical adventure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINDHORN REVISITED</strong>    </p>    <p>      Though a few details are still being worked out, we're      delighted to offer you a second Visit to Findhorn and      Friends from June 2 to June 23, 1983. Not only will you      have a chance to live and learn at the New Age community of      Findhorn itself, but we'll again spend a wonderful week      with those warm, fine residents of the Hebrides island of      Erraid (see page 24 in this issue) . . . with tentative      plans to end our stay by celebrating Midsummer Eve at      Glastonbury, the legendary burial place of King Arthur      (located just a short distance from Stonehenge).    </p>    <p>      Our 1982 Findhorn/Erraid visit was one of the most popular      and pleasing trips that we've ever sponsored, and our 1983      version should be even better. But space is limited, so be      sure to get your $200 deposit in early. The full cost will      be approximately $1,790, including airfare from New York      and all other expenses except for some meals en route and      in Glastonbury.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AUSTRALIA ON A SHOESTRING</strong>    </p>    <p>      We were really amazed when our cosponsor, Jordan College,      came up with such bargain prices for the following travel      options to the International Solar Energy Society Congress,      which will be held in Perth, Australia in August 1983. This      international forum gives folks a chance to find out just      what's happening in the alternative-energy field on a      worldwide basis, as well as the opportunity to meet with      its top leaders, scientists, engineers, and equipment      manufacturers.    </p>    <p>      For those on a tight budget, a ten-day trip (August 10 to      20, 1983) costs $1,550, including airfare from San      Francisco or Los Angeles and university housing . . . while      the same trip with accommodations at a deluxe hotel is      priced at only $1,675. Or, after attending the ISES      Congress, you can extend your vacation until August      26-with visits to Thailand, Hong Kong, and      Japan-for just $2,750. And for an extra $75 a day,      you can also take advantage of an optional stopover in      Hawaii or Tahiti or both. Whichever of these itineraries      you choose, a $200 deposit will reserve your place. These      prices, however, don't include the ISES Congress fee, which      ranges from $50 for student members of the society to $170      for adult nonmembers.    </p>    <p>      To make reservations for this trip, or any of our other      excursions, send your deposit ($50 of which is      nonrefundable)-by certified check or money      order-to Mother's Tours, 105 Stoney Mountain Road,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791 . . . or write for      more information.    </p>
