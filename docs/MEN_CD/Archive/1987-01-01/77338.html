                         <p>      <em>If you'd like our panel of consultants to answer a      question concerning some aspect of self-reliant living that      has you stumped, send it to Ask Our Experts,</em>      <em>MOTHER EAR TH NEWS, P. 0.</em> <em>Box 70,      Hendersonville, NC 29793. The most frequently asked      questions wall be answered here-and here      only-so that we can all benefit from what these folks      have to say.</em>    </p>    <h3>Freezing Pipes</h3>         <p>      The water pipes in my crawl space freeze every winter. Are      there any really effective steps I can take to keep this      from happening?    </p>    <p><strong>      Most houses with crawl spaces are located in the Southeast      and Far West, regions with lower than average heating      requirements and somewhat higher humidity levels. With a      few exceptions, less than 20% of the houses in the rest of      the country use such perimeter foundations. Because a crawl      space is somewhat exposed to the environment, even brief      cold spells can freeze water in the plumbing beneath the      house.</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>      The simplest solutions-allowing the faucets to      trickle constantly, or wrapping the pipe runs with      electrical-resistance heat tape-are also the most      wasteful and not always 100% effective. A better remedy      would be to insulate the plumbing with foam wrap made for      this purpose, and close the perimeter vents during the      coldest months. In higher-humidity areas, however, this      might encourage floor-joist and structural decay,      especially if the wood moisture content exceeds 28%.</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>      Since water tends to freeze at the points of maximum      restriction, a low-wattage light bulb placed near a chronic      tight spot (an elbow or reducer, for example) might solve      the problem. Also, if you're replumbing, consider routing      the runs alongside heating ducts where possible-and      keep in mind that plastic pipe is a better insulator than      conductive copper.</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>      Probably the best permanent fix is to apply extruded      polystyrene insulation board to the perimeter wall with      construction adhesive. (If it's placed outside, protect it      with a parge coat or some other material.) It should set      you back about half the cost of floor insulation and will      protect both the crawl space and the living space above it.      If under-house moisture is a concern, consider laying      sheets of 6-mil polyethylene over the earth in the crawl      space and holding the plastic down at the edges with bricks      or cap blocks.</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>-Dennis Burkholder</strong></p>    <p>      <em>Dennis Burkholder is one of</em> <em>MOTHER's</em>      <em>research staffers.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Old Smelly Potbelly</strong>    </p>    <p>      I recently bought an old Union No. 28 cast-iron potbelly      stove at a sale. Two problems have slowed my attempts to      restore it.    </p>    <p>      The first is smoke. I took the stove apart to clean it, and      smoke now leaks out between the joints of the three body      sections. There obviously used to be gaskets between the      sections, but the common rope-style gaskets won't work      because there's no groove in the cast iron.    </p>    <p>      My second problem is air intake. The damper consists of two      panels that slide from side to side in a frame. I      understand how it works, but there's a 1/4" space all the      way across the top of the doors. This gap allows air to      enter even when the panels are closed all the way. Also,      there's a 1 "-high, 3"-wide opening on the side of the      stove at its base. The leakage through these two gaps makes      it hard to slow the combustion rate for an extended burn.    </p>    <p>      The stove appears to be original-without cracks,      cuts, or adaptations. I've called several stove companies,      but haven't gotten any help. Is the Union Stove Company      even still around?    </p>    <p>      Indeed, the Union Manufacturing Co. (PO Box 522, Boyertown,      PA 19512, 215/367-5360) is still in business, though Model      No. 28 has long since been discontinued. The friendly      people there offered to look around for leftover parts if      you'll call and let them know exactly what you want.      Meanwhile, there are some other steps you can take.    </p>    <p>      If much smoke is spilling from the gaps between the stove      body sections, investigate your chimney. Chimney draft      should be sufficient to pull air into the stove through the      gaps; smoke should not escape. Once the chimney is working,      then worry about the leaks.    </p>    <p>      Gasket now comes in a wide range of sizes and shapes. Flat      gasket (about 1/8" thick and <em>1/4"</em> to 1/2" wide) is      widely used on modern woodstove doors. This may solve the      problem of the leaky sections. A woodstove dealer should be      able to get some from Rutland Products, Meeco Red Devil, or      other distributors. You could also use furnace cement to      seal the sections.    </p>    <p>      The folks at Union Manufacturing told me that No. 28 was      mostly a coalburning stove, which explains the gaps at the      top of the damper slides and the 1" X 3" opening. Coal      heaters require more and different air sources from wood      burners.    </p>    <p>      I've watched several people try to coax old potbellies into      giving all-night burns on wood. Their successes have been      marginal at best. Those who've thought of their old      potbellies as antiques have been happy; those who've tried      to use them as dependable heaters have soon gone shopping      for newer, more efficient units.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-David Schoonmaker</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>David Schoonmaker is a technical editor for      MOTHER.</em>    </p>    <h3>Toilet Tank Condensation</h3>    <p>      I have a problem with condensation from my toilet tank. We      want to put an oak floor in the bathroom, but we're afraid      the water will ruin it in no time. Meanwhile, we keep a      long pan on the floor to catch the drippings. Any      suggestions?    </p>    <p>      First, make certain the moisture isn't coming from a      hairline crack in the tank-or from a damaged ballcock      valve or seat, which could spray water onto the lid and      down the outside of the tank.    </p>    <p>      If you've determined that the tank is indeed sweating, try      lowering the temperature of the bathroom and the      surrounding area and reducing the humidity of the room with      a dehumidifier or a ventilating fan. In addition, you could      install a plastic tank liner to insulate the tank walls      from the cold water.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Richard Freudenberger</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Richard Freudenberger is MOTHER's research      coordinator.</em>    </p>
