            		<p><strong>MOTHER'S HANDBOOK</strong></p>         <p>      <strong>This excerpt from Lewis Hill's</strong>      <strong><br />      <em>Pruning Simplified</em> shows how to<br />      improve your fruit trees.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Gardeners expect surprisingly modest yields from their      orchards. I have a friend who always has a superb vegetable      garden, a wonderful Led of roses, and the best strawberry      patch in town. Each tomato is a jewel. Every stalk of corn      produces two large ears, and every flower in his perennial      bed looks as if it is posing for the cover of a garden      magazine. Yet, in spite of his gardening skill, he seems to      be perfectly satisfied to take whatever his fruit trees      hand him.    </p>    <p>      Often this isn't very much. He has good fruit when      conditions are perfect, but it's usually small, misshapen,      poorly colored, and infested with insects. Furthermore, he      typically gets a crop only every other year.    </p>    <p>      I'm sure that when his trees were young, they were full of      vigor and produced excellent fruit. Young trees almost      always bear large, colorful fruit because they still have      very few limbs, so the fruit gets lots of sunlight.      However, as the trees mature and grow more branches, you      must prune to keep them producing well. Most trees      naturally produce a large crop of fruit every other year,      so if you want your trees to grow an annual crop, you must      give them some special attention. Pruning is a neglected      art, however, and one that novice fruit growers don't      completely understand.    </p>    <p>      Pruning fruit trees doesn't need to be confusing. If you      follow the simple, basic rules, you can leave the      scientific jargon to those who are intrigued by it.    </p>    <p>      First of all, an orchardist must be aware that his tree      consists of two parts-most fruit trees are grafted.      The roots usually belong to a type of tree that produces      low-quality fruit, whereas the top is a good-bearing      variety that has been transplanted onto the rootstock. The      two have been grafted together because this is the most      efficient way to produce large numbers of quality fruit      trees. Fruit trees grown from seed seldom resemble the      parent tree even slightly, and growing trees from cuttings      or layers is slow and extremely difficult.    </p>  <h3> Reasons for Pruning</h3>        <p>      Some gardeners enjoy pruning their fruit trees and      consequently do a good job. However, no one should prune      simply for the fun of it-you should know the reasons      for pruning. All of the following are equally important to      the health and maintenance of your trees:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Prune to get the tree off to a good start.</strong>      Although it isn't easy, you should cut back any bare-rooted      young tree at planting time. When we prune trees for      customers at the nursery, they wince and say that it looks      as if we are slaughtering the poor things, but we assure      them that it is one of the best things you can do to insure      good growth and early crops.    </p>    <p>      Trees enclosed in a ball of soil or growing in a pot will      not need any cutback. However, bare-rooted trees have      probably been dug recently, and chances are good that some      of the roots have been seriously damaged in the process.      Most mail-order plants are sold bare-rooted, and unless the      directions you receive with the tree indicate that it has      already been done, you should prune both the roots and top      at planting time.    </p>    <p>      First, cut off any jagged edges on broken roots so they      will heal smoothly. Then cut back the top to make it equal      in size to the root surface. Cut back fruit trees that are      whips-those with no side branches-by at least a      third: If a tree is six feet tall, for example, cut it back      at least two feet, and make the cut on a slant just above a      bud.    </p>    <p>      If your fruit tree has branches, cut of those that are      weak, dead-looking, broken, or too close to the ground.      Then cut back the top by a third and each strong, healthy      limb by at least a third also. Cut each limb back to an      outside bud so that the next branch will form toward the      outside and the tree will spread outward rather than inward      toward the trunk. (See the sidebar "Training Young Apple      and Pear Trees.")    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind that these directions are only for pruning new      trees. Don't neglect the other ingredients for proper      planting, like soaking bare-rooted trees for several hours      after arrival, using lots of good soil and water while      planting, and planting to the right depth. Most fruit tree      failures are due to the lack of proper planting as well as      the failure to prune the tree properly at planting time.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Prune lightly to shape the tree during the first      years of its life.</strong> The old saying "as the twig is      bent, so the tree is inclined" is unquestionably true. A      little snipping and pinching here and there while the tree      is young will save you a lot of heavy pruning later on.    </p>    <p>      If you have trained your tree properly early in its life,      all subsequent pruning will come easier. Whenever you clip      or snip off the buds or tiny twigs, try to keep in mind an      image of the mature tree. Prune in accordance with the      tree's natural growth habit and for the purpose of'      developing a strong tree with a branch structure sturdy      enough to hold up the crop. Keep the branches sparse enough      to allow the sunshine in to ripen the fruit.    </p>    <p>      You should prune very little during the tree's first      yearsjust enough to help shape the tree. Although it's good      to prune heavily at planting time, this process may cause      it to grow too many branches close to the ground. By      pinching or clipping off all those undesirable new sprouts      during the first years, you will be training the new tree      to grow upright. You'll also avoid the heavier pruning      which would delay the tree's first crop.    </p>    <p>      Some trees need more shaping than others. Many varieties of      apples, such as Wealthy and McIntosh, seem to grow into a      good shape quite naturally. Other varieties, like the      Delicious and Yellow Transparent, tend to grow very      upright, forming lots of tops with bad crotches. If left      uncorrected, these weak crotches and the limbs coming from      them are very likely to break under a heavy load of fruit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pruning tools should</strong><strong>be sterilized      to prevent the spread of disease.</strong>    </p>                                            <p>      Fruit-loads on plums and cherries are not as heavy as those      on pears and apples. Since they are apt to grow into a      bushy shape no matter what you do, early shaping is      important mainly to keep them from getting too wide or to      prevent the branches from growing too close to the ground.    </p>    <p>      Some trees grow twiggy naturally, and certain apple      varieties, such as Jonathan, as well as many varieties of      cherries, plums, peaches, and apricots, need additional      thinning of their bearing wood to let in sunshine to ripen      the fruit.    </p>    <p>      Direct all of your early pruning to guiding the tree into      the desired shape. Fruit trees are usually trained in one      of three forms: central leader, modified leader, or open      center.    </p>    <p>      <em>Central leader.</em> Trees that bear heavy crops of      large fruit, including apples and pears, are usually best      pruned to grow with a central leader, or trunk, at least in      their younger days. With only one strong trunk in the      center of the tree, branches come strongly out from it at      fairly wide angles and can safely bear abundant loads of      fruit.    </p>    <p>      Thin out the branches growing from the central leader as      necessary to allow open space between the limbs. Thin also      the branches that come from these limbs, and so on to the      outermost branches. Sunlight produces colorful, flavorful,      vitamin-enriched fruit. Sunlight and circulating air also      help to prevent scab, mildew, and a host of other diseases      that thrive in shade and high humidity.    </p>    <p>      Eventually you will have to remove the top of the central      leader because this high-growing leader will gradually sag      under a load of heavy fruit, forming a canopy over part of      the tree that will shut out the light. Cutting back the top      helps prevent a canopy from developing while also keeping      the tree from growing too tall.    </p>    <p>      <em>Modified leader.</em> The modified leader method is      initially the same as the central leader method, but      eventually you let the central trunk branch off to form      several tops (Fig. 3). This training insures that the loads      of fruit at the top of the tree are never as heavy as those      at the bottom, where limbs are larger. Cut back the tops of      larger trees from time to time to shorten the tree or to      let in more light. Although the central leader method is      preferred by most orchardists for growing apples and pears,      the modified leader method is easier to maintain simply      because most fruit trees grow that way naturally.    </p>    <p>      <em>Open center.</em> The open center method, also known as      the open top or vase method, is an excellent way to let      more light into the shady interior of a tree (Fig. 4).      Since this method produces a tree with a weaker branch      structure than if it had a strong central leader, the      lightweight fruits are the best subjects: quinces, crab      apples, plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, and apricots.    </p>    <p>      Prune so that the limbs forming the vase effect do not all      come out of the main trunk close to each other, or they      will form a cluster of weak crotches. Even with the whole      center of the tree open, you'll have to thin the branches      and remove the older limbs eventually, just as you would      with a tree pruned in the central leader method.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Prune for good crops of quality fruit.</strong>      Good fruit needs plenty of sunshine, and a fruit tree      fortunately has a potentially large area to produce fruit:      a full-size, standard tree can be well over 30 feet wide      and 20 feet high. However, only 30% of an unpruned tree,      because of its tight branch structure, gets enough light,      while another 40% gets only a fair amount of light. As      these percentages indicate, when only the top exterior of      the tree produces good fruit, you are getting the use of      but a third of your tree, and all that fruit is grown where      it is most difficult to pick. Even the most careful pruning      won't bring the light efficiency to a full 100%, but you      can greatly increase it.    </p>    <p>      The drawings in Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the theory of      pruning to let the light in. Since a fruit tree is      three-dimensional, your tree won't look just like the      drawings. They are exaggerated to show why pruning should      be done and how it lets more light into the tree.    </p>    <p>      Another way to improve the quality of your fruit is to      remove the surplus fruit whenever your tree sets too many      (Fig. 7). Although regular pruning will cut down the number      of fruits produced, a tree may still bear a greater number      than it can develop to a large size. The production of too      many seeds seems to tax a tree's strength, and certain      varieties of fruits seem bent on bearing themselves to      death, unless you give them a helping hand. When a tree      bears too many fruits in any one year, it usually bears      few, if any, fruits the following year. Thin out extras      when they are small. Most trees, as well as their fruits,      benefit if you leave only one fruit remaining in each      cluster. Make sure that each fruit is at least six inches      from its neighbor on either side.    </p>    <p>      <strong>By replacing and renewing the old bearing wood,you      encourage</strong><strong>the tree to bear well.</strong>    </p>   <h3> Prune to keep your trees from getting too      large.</h3>    <p>      Since standard-size fruit trees can grow to 25 feet or      more, they are often pruned to keep them at a more      manageable height. A tall tree is difficult and dangerous      to work in. And, because so much of the tree is shaded, it      often produces poor fruit.    </p>    <p>      Of course it's best to prune regularly so that your tree      won't get too tall in the first place, but if this advice      comes too late, consider shortening it. The tree should be      healthy enough to stand major surgery. Make sure that there      will be enough lower branches left on the tree to sustain      it after its upper level has been removed: The leaf surface      remaining must be adequate to supply nutrients to the tree.      If these conditions can be met, begin to prune back the top      in late summer or early fall. Make the cuts in small      stages, cutting off only small pieces of limbs at one time,      so that the limb weight will be lessened before you begin      the heavy cutting. These small cuts lessen the danger of      splitting limbs, and also help insure that you won't drop      heavy pieces of wood onto the lower branches. If possible,      have a helper handy to catch the limbs as they fall or to      guide them away from the tree (Fig. 8).    </p>    <p>      Don't cut off more than one large limb in any one year.      Make sure that some regrowth has started on the lower      branches before you make any further cuts. Like an obese      person, the tree got into its overgrown condition over a      period of many years, so don't try to correct all its      problems at once.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Prune to keep your tree healthy.</strong> Even      young fruit trees occasionally need to be pruned because of      some mishap: Limbs get broken, tent caterpillars build      nests, and as the tree gets older, rot and winter injury      often take their toll on the branches.    </p>    <p>      As soon as you notice any damage, clip or saw off the      injured part back to a live limb or to the trunk. Even one      deteriorating limb is not good for the tree's health, and      the accumulation of several sick limbs will speed up the      decline of the tree.    </p>    <p>      Rejuvenation is vital to a tree's health, especially when      your goal is to produce good crops of high-quality fruit      over a number of years. Many trees that produce handsome      specimens while they are young or middleaged often bear      only small, poor fruit as they grow older. By replacing and      renewing the old bearing wood, you encourage the tree to      continue bringing forth large red apples or big crops of      juicy plums or peaches.    </p>    <p>      As with every other kind of pruning, you'll get the best      results from rejuvenation pruning when you do it on an      annual basis rather than as an occasional event. If you      remove a few of the older limbs each year to open up the      tree to sunlight and air, the whole bearing surface can be      renewed every six or eight years, which is like getting a      whole new tree. In addition, because you will seldom need      to do any drastic pruning of large, heavy limbs, the tree      will suffer less.    </p>    <p>      Large limbs should grow only as an extension of the tree      trunk itself, and as a unit from which the small limbs      grow. These overlarge limbs are a tremendous strain on the      tree, so the fewer, the better. Because fruit trees are      pruned more heavily than most other plant life, heavy limb      growth is much more likely to result than when a tree is      left unpruned or lightly pruned. Cut off crossed branches      or branches that might rub to cause wounds in the bark      (Fig. 9).    </p>    <p>      Water sprouts are those upright branches that grow in      clumps, often from a large pruning wound (Fig. 10). They      are usually unproductive, and they can weaken the tree by      causing additional, unwanted shade. You should remove water      sprouts promptly.    </p>    <p>      Suckers are the branches that grow on the lower part of the      tree trunk or from the roots of the tree (Fig. 10). Usually      they grow from below the graft, so if you don't remove      them, they'll grow into a wild tree or bush that will crowd      out the good part of the tree within a few years. A lot of      sucker growth results on fruit trees when a slower-growing      variety is grafted onto a vigorous-growing rootstock.      Usually the suckers appear as a cluster of branches close      to the base of the tree trunk, but sometimes (especially on      plum trees) they may pop up out of the roots anywhere under      the tree, even a distance away from the trunk. Mow or clip      them off at ground level as soon as they appear.    </p>    <h3>When to Prune</h3>        <p>      There is an ever-continuing argument among pomologists      about the best time to prune fruit trees. Magazines often      run articles supporting one time of year or another, and      each professional orchardist and experienced home grower      has a favorite time. Meanwhile, beginners can get      completely confused listening to the controversy.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the best way to help answer the question is to      describe what happens when you prune at different seasons.      Seasonal conditions vary greatly throughout the country, so      your location is an important factor in determining when      you should prune.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Spring.</strong> Most people agree that pruning a      fruit tree when it is just beginning to make its most      active growth is one of the worst times. The tree will      probably bleed heavily, and it may have trouble recovering      from the loss of so much sap. Also, infections such as fire      blight are most active and easily spread around in the      spring. If a book suggests pruning in the early spring, the      author often means late winter-before any growth begins.    </p>    <p>      The only pruning you should do in the spring is to remove      any branches that have been broken by winter storms or      injured by the cold. Immediately tack bark that has split      from the trunk back onto the wood, and seal the wound with      tree dressing to prevent air from drying the bare wood.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Early summer.</strong> Although I don't recommend      major pruning in early summer, this is a good time to pinch      off buds and snip off small branches that are growing in      the wrong direction or in the wrong place. Remove suckers,      water sprouts, and branches that have formed too low on the      stem as soon as you notice them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Late summer.</strong> Late summer is a favorite      time for many people to prune their fruit trees. By pruning      after the tree has completed its yearly growth and hardened      its wood and before it has lost its leaves, you stimulate      less regrowth. You still have to take care of any frost      injury in late winter, but this late summer-early fall      pruning works well if extensive winter damage is not      likely.    </p>    <p>      Wherever growing seasons are short and the extreme cold or      heavy snow and ice loads may cause injury to the trees,      late-winter pruning is best. Don't cut back the tree in      late summer if there's a good chance that the remaining      branches will be winter-killed. You'll have to prune away      too much of the tree.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Late fall and winter.</strong> Late fall or winter      is a favorite time to prune in the warmer parts of the      country. Orchardists have more spare time then, and the      trees are bare, so it is easier to see what needs to be      done. You should choose days when the temperature is above      freezing, however, to avoid injury to the wood. Because      frozen wood is very brittle, it breaks easily when hit.    </p>    <p>      However, if you live in a cold part of the country, or if      you are growing tree varieties that are inclined to have      winter injury, wait until the coldest weather is over      before pruning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Late winter.</strong> This season is probably the      most popular time for northern gardeners to prune. As in      late fall and winter, the tree is completely dormant, and      since the leaves are off, it is easy to see where to make      the cuts. You can repair any winter injury, the weather is      usually warm enough during the day, and most orchardists      are not too busy during this season.    </p>    <p>      If you prune your trees regularly each year, late winter is      a satisfactory time to prune because you don't have to      remove large amounts of wood. However, if the trees have      been neglected for a few years and are badly in need of a      cutback, late winter is not the best time to prune.      Excessive pruning in late winter usually stimulates a great      deal of growth the following spring and summer, because the      tree tries to replace its lost wood. Branches, suckers, and      water sprouts are likely to grow in great abundance. If a      major pruning job is necessary, do all or at least a large      part of it in late summer or early fall so that you won't      cause a great amount of regrowth.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Pruning Simplified is <em>available      for $12.95 plus $2 shipping and handling from Garden Way      Publishing, Storey Communications, Schoolhouse Rd., Pownal,      VT 05261.</em>    </p>    <h3>PRUNING SANITATION</h3>    <p>      Some of the most serious diseases are carried by pruning      tools. Fire blight, for example, a bacteria-caused disease      that is lethal to fruit trees, has spread around many      orchards this way.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Training Young apple and pear      trees</strong></em>    </p>                            <p>      If you suspect disease, think of yourself as a tree doctor      as you prune. You wouldn't expect a surgeon to take out      your gallbladder with the same dirty instruments he had      used to remove his last patient's appendix. Your prized      Bartlett pear deserves careful treatment, with tools that      have been disinfected.    </p>    <p>      If you feel that there might be disease in your orchard,      disinfect your gloves and tools after pruning each tree.      Professional orchardists often use a mixture of bichloride      of mercury and cyanide of mercury for this purpose, but      both of these chemicals are very poisonous and are not      recommended for home use. For the home orchardist, it is      safer and quite effective to soak the tools in a pail      containing fullstrength Clorox or similar home bleach as      you go between branches or trees. With these germ-free      tools, you can approach your patients with a clear      conscience and not feel they are drawing their limbs about      them in fear and trembling.    </p>    <p>      Disease also spreads around the orchard via the wind and      insects. A good way to keep fungus, germs, and insects out      of a tree is to seal up all cuts and open wounds with an      antiseptic paint. Most tree infections are especially      active in the spring, so do your painting and sealing early      in the season before they get started. Remove all of the      pruning debris from the area, and either burn it or take it      to a dump or landfill.    </p>
