                    <p>      With Alar gone, they're welcome back.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Olwen Woodier    </h5>    <p>      Autumn positively sings of apples. A visit to an orchard at      this time of year affords a wonderful assault on the      senses: The soft days are redolent with the winy fragrance      of ripe fruit and the woody smell of smoke lingering in the      damp air. People have been munching on apples for about      750,000 years, ever since the food gatherers of early      Paleolithic times discovered sour crab apples in the      Caucasus Mountains in southwestern Asia. Today, the fruit's      tantalizing fragrance and tart, sweet, spicy taste have      made it one of the most popular in America.    </p>    <p>      Apples are, of course, famous for how they taste encased in      pie crust, but cooking with them doesn't have to stop      there. With a little imagination, you can use this      versatile fruit not only in sweet dishes, but throughout      the meal-from hors d'oeuvres to dessert and all the      courses in between.    </p>    <p>      And the options don't end with the recipes. More than 7,000      varieties to choose from-each with its own unique      flavor-make cooking with apples a true culinary adventure.    </p>        <h3>Apple and Raspberry Pie</h3>    <p>      Pastry for a double pie crust<br />      1 tablespoon raspberry jam<br />      12-ounce package frozen raspberries<br />      1-1/2 tablespoons cornstarch<br />      1/4 cup sugar<br />      1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br />      1/3 cup sugar<br />      4 large cooking apples    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 425°F. Grease a 9-inch or 10-inch pie      plate. Roll out half the pastry and fit it into pie plate.      Smooth raspberry jam over bottom of pie shell. Refrigerate.      Thaw and drain raspberries, reserving liquid. Pour juice      into small saucepan, stir in cornstarch and 1/4 cup sugar.      Bring cornstarch mixture to a boil over low heat, stirring      until juice is thick and smooth. Remove from heat, stir in      drained raspberries, and cool. Combine flour and remaining      1/3 cup sugar. Peel, core, and cut apples into 1/4-inch      slices. Alternate layers of apple slices and flour mixture      in chilled pie shell. Top with cooled raspberry mixture.      Roll out top crust, place over filling, trim and flute      edges. Make 3 steam slits in center. Bake at 425° for      15 minutes, reduce heat to 350° and bake for 30-40      minutes longer, until crust is golden brown. If edges start      getting too brown, cover with aluminum foil. Allow pie to      set before serving. Serve warm. Serves 8.    </p>    <h3>Open-Faced Apple Sandwiches</h3>    <p>      Forget the bread and crackers-substitute apple rings      instead. Topped with a variety of spreads, cheeses and      meats, they bring a welcome change to the hors d'oeuvre      platter.    </p>    <p>      Wash and core the apples and cut them into 1/4-inch to      1/2-inch slices.
