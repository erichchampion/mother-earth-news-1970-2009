                    <p>      News that fits nowhere else</p><p>Note from the undersea-As reported last month in a    very interesting new magazine, Arctic Circle, published above    the ice way up there in the Northwest Territories, a new    scheme is afoot for extracting, processing and transporting    crude oil below the ice: "As the world price for crude oil    creeps toward $25 a barrel," the article explains,    "exploration and development activity in Canada's Arctic is    beginning to intensify, recovering from the disastrous era of    the mid-1980s. What's more, the technological complexity of    many projects verges on the incredible. Calgary-based    Panarctic Oils Limited, for example, has announced a plan    that Jules Verne might have drafted to draw oil from a    production facility on the seabed and transport it beneath    the ice in huge submarine tankers. The facility, to be    constructed under the ice at a depth of 350 meters, would    produce 25,000 barrels a day from the more than 250 million    barrels believed to be recoverable from the Cisco field    (roughly half the size of Newfoundland's Hibernia oil    field)."    </p><p>      DATES To REMEMBER-<strong>September 10-16</strong> has been designated      "Organically Grown Week" to celebrate you know what.    </p>    <p>      Advance notice tells us the week will be heavily promoted,      with lots of T-shirts, buttons and bumper stickers paving      the way, or at least decorating the route. While such      trappings make the organic-food movement seem a trifle      crass and commercial, a lot of us can remember when raising      crops organically was regarded as a nearly treasonable act.      So let us rejoice despite the hoopla and applaud the fact      that growing organic is becoming mainstream. For more      information, contact the Committee for Sustainable      Agriculture (P.O. Box 1300, Colfax, CA 95713).    </p>    <p>      <strong>October 7,</strong>the first Sunday of the month, marks the      celebration of the Feast of Saint Francis of Assisi,      founder of the Franciscan order, who in the Christian      hagiography is to animals what Saint Elmo is to sailors. A      Mendicant who ministered to the poor and the homeless,      Francis also possessed that somewhat rare affinity with      animals that crops up now and then among naturalists,      biologists, veterinarians, shepherds and homesteaders, to      name a few. Some people just have a way with animals, and      Francis was one of them: According to legend, he befriended      a wild wolf that wandered down into Gubbio from the Umbrian      hills.    </p>        <p>Over the last couple of decades, however,      Francis's spiritual pastures have been enlarged to the      extent that he is now often referred to as the patron saint      of ecology. With the possible exception of the shrine in      Assisi itself in central Italy, which is visited by throngs      of pilgrims every year, the grandest celebration in his      honor takes place in one of the most urban settings ever      devised-the Big Apple. Not only that, it takes place      in the largest (if yet unfinished) Gothic cathedral ever      devised, St. John the Divine, an architecturally      anachronistic masterpiece that occupies several acres on      Manhattan's Upper West Side. Come the morning of the 7th,      the cathedral's vast Episcopal doors will swing open to      admit a procession of creatures reminiscent both of Noah's      ark (but in single, unmated file) and of that song      high-school choirs used to sing to give their captive      audiences a breather from more august compositions: "I went      to the animal fair, the birds and the beasts were there/The      big baboon by the light of the moon was combing his auburn      hair ...." And like that.</p><p>Last year, the menagerie ranged      from an elephant to a cockroach and was greeted by a      liturgy that included the howling of wolves and the      murmurations of whales, evoked by the equally plaintive      chords of the Paul Winter Consort. More than an instance of      P.T. Barnum infused with High Church incense and a little      hallelujah, the celebration culminated not only in the      blessing of the animals but also in the blessing of an      ecologically troubled world. In an odd, symbolic way, the      cathedral that day seemed like a wildlife refuge. Misplaced      in time, perhaps, but lofty and safe. And open to all, no      matter their species.    </p>
