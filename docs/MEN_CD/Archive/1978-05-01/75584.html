               	 <hr />    <p>      It <em>seemed</em> like a good idea at the time . . . back      there in July of 1944, at the Bretton Woods Economic      Summit. After all: Hadn't the United States just proven      itself to be the "Arsenal of Democracy"? Hadn't the U.S.      just saved the world from the Axis powers? Didn't the      United States have an almost invincible hammerlock on the      world's supply of gold? Wasn't the U.S.-even      then-pumping millions of dollars' worth of equipment,      food, and other goods into the reconstruction of almost all      the war-torn nations-friend and foe alike-on      earth?    </p>    <p>      Of course! Everyone knew that the U.S. of A.-for many      reasons-had emerged at the end of the war as the      richest and most powerful country in the world. Besides      that, ole Uncle Sugar was a Good Guy too. A little naive,      to be true ("The U.S. has never lost a war or won a      conference," said the negotiation-wise Europeans with a      wink) . . . but certainly thoughtful, generous, kind,      clean, and reverent to a fault.    </p>    <p>      So what could be more natural than to make the U.S.      dollar-which, at the time, most certainly seemed "as      good as gold"- <em>really</em> as good as gold.      Shucks! <em>Everybody</em> knew that Uncle Sam's word was      his bond anyway. And that Fort Knox was literally bulging      with the yellow metal. And that when the leaders of the      United States said that the dollar would <em>always</em> be      freely convertible into gold (at the rate of $35 per ounce)      . . . well-by gum!-they meant it.    </p>    <p>      And so-with the stroke of a pen-the U.S. dollar      was officially declared to be As Good As Gold . . . and ail      the other nations in the world were encouraged to use our      Treasury's promise to cough up one ounce of .999 fine (or      thereabouts) gold in exchange for thirty-five one-dollar      bills <em>. . . as the basis for their own currencies.</em>    </p>    <p>      That is: If you were in charge of the money supply for      Lower Slobbovia, you could salt away an ounce of gold in      your nation's central bank vaults . . . and      then-since people generally found it more convenient      to carry a few pieces of paper around instead of a      pocketful of heavy, clunky metal-you could issue one      ounce worth of IOU's (paper money) against it.    </p>    <p>      Or (as central bankers and politicians are always quick to      figure out) you could do far better than that! History has      shown, time and again, that-as long as times are      good-people vastly prefer to transact their business      with light, convenient paper notes rather than bagfuls of      heavy gold coins.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, only a very few individuals will ask      to trade their paper money-which, remember, is merely      a collection of IOU's issued against a stack of gold (      <em>real</em> wealth)-in for that gold on any given      day. So few . . . that you can actually print up and      circulate about <em>five</em> ounces' worth of money      (IOU's) for every one ounce of gold that your central bank      vault really contains.    </p>    <p>      Think of that! If you're a central banker, you can      arbitrarily "print money"-create money out of thin      air-that doesn't actually represent any real wealth      at all ... loan this "ghost" currency out at interest . . .      become wealthy on the proceeds . . . and, at least for a      time, get away with it! Or, if you're a politician with a      central bank at your command, you can order up big wads of      the same "ghost" money out of the same thin air . . .      and-at least for a time-use it to finance all      kinds of grandiose social schemes, weapons races, and other      programs "for the people and the good of the nation".    </p>    <p>      What a deal (at least for a time) for central bankers and      politicians! But wait! <em>Thanks to</em> <em>the Bretton      Woods conference, this particular setup was magically      sweetened several times over again for all its      "insiders".</em> Don't you see? By merely drawing up a      Gentlemen's Agreement that the U.S. dollar was As Good As      Gold . . . why, you could multiply the Good Thing you had      going for yourself another five times over.    </p>    <p>      That is: For every dollar's worth of gold (at $35 an ounce)      that the United States had in its central bank vaults, the      U.S. could issue <em>five</em> paper dollars.      And-since all the finance ministers and heads of      state (more or less) of the whole free world had agreed      that the dollar was As Good As Gold-well, obviously,      for every one of those U.S. dollars you then stashed away      in your Lower Slobbovia central bank vault . . . you could      print up <em>five more dollars'</em> worth of Slobbovian      currency. (Giving you, of course, a final money supply 25      times greater than the amount of gold you started with.)    </p>    <p>      Hot Dog! Let the Good Times roll! And roll they did. Thanks      to the mountain of gold in its vaults and the Bretton Woods      agreement, the United States came out of World War 11 with      what-at the time-seemed to be an unlimited      magic wand.    </p>    <p>      What's that? Europe needs to be rebuilt? Just print up some      dollars and spend as much as you have to to get the job      done. The commies are causing trouble in Korea? Run off a      few billion more paper IOU's and finance a war. The      Russians wanna have an arms race? Roll out the printing      presses and pay for our entries with another shot of paper      money. Got a little recession throwing people out of work      right here at home? Kite another batch of paper to "get      this country moving again". Need to buy a few million      votes? Declare some vast new social scheme and pay for it      with paper.    </p>    <p>      And so we passed through the last half of the 40's . . .      through all of the 50's ... and on into the 60's. First      class all the way. Unlimited expense accounts. With bigger      and better tail fins on our cars, a new home in the suburbs      for everyone (well, everyone who really <em>counted</em>      anyway), second houses up on the lakes, imported TV's and      stereo sets and automobiles, and vacations all over the      world.    </p>    <p>      The rest of the free nations weren't doing so bad either.      As fast as we pumped out those paper dollars for the      reconstruction of Europe, the Cold War, the missile race,      the space race, the imports, the vacations, and all the      rest . . . our allies stuffed 'em into their central banks      and used 'em as the foundation for the creation of <em>five      times more</em> of their own currencies. Which they then      used to buy machine tools and Coca-Cola and all kinds of      stuff from us.    </p>    <p>      And everybody in the developed nations went out lookin' for      more and more raw materials to exploit to keep all this      industrial activity going. And, pretty soon, we had all      discovered just how little those dumb Arabs would sell      their petroleum for and how easy it was to inveigle Africa      and parts of Asia and almost all of South and Central      America and the rest of the underdeveloped world out of its      raw materials. And we all kept right on cranking our      printing presses up a notch or two from time to time so's      we'd have more paper IOU's to trade away for fresh      infusions of that real wealth-oil and minerals and      timber and cheap labor-that we'd come to depend upon      so heavily. And we all figured that the binge would never      end.    </p>    <p>      But . . . somewhere . . . along . . . the way . . . a few .      . . of the smarter folks among us . . . began to realize .      . . just what the <em>hell</em> was going on.    </p>    <p>      "Hey!" each of these somewhat brighter people told him- or      herself. "We're all getting `rich' . . . but we're doing it      on the `buy now, pay later' plan. We're paying for      everything with paper IOU's. And when you buy on credit,      sooner or later you have to settle the bill. What's going      to happen when all our bills come due . . . and, maybe,      there isn't enough gold to go around? Perhaps I'd be      prudent if-right now, while the gettin's still      good-I just went ahead and converted some of my paper      IOU's into gold. That way I'll be prepared if a crunch does      come."    </p>    <p>      And so these more attentive folks-people who could      tune out the brayings of the "something for everyone" and      "prosperity at the stroke of a pen" politicians and think      and evaluate for themselves-did begin to cash their      inflated currencies in for dollars. And then they traded      those dollars for little bits of the mountain of gold that      ole Uncle Sugar had stashed away in Fort Knox.    </p>    <p>      Actually, to a small extent, this "cashing in" of paper for      gold had been going on from the start. But it really began      to accelerate in the mid-60's when President      Johnson-in the egomaniacal way of most recent U. S.      heads of state-declared that we'd have both guns (the      Vietnam War) and butter (The Great Society) . . . and      kicked the dollar printing presses into overdrive to pay      for them.    </p>    <p>      As that increasing flood of paper IOU's began to wash over      the world, the greater and greater numbers of dollars      started to bid up the prices of the limited amounts of the      planet's resources in a noticeable way. And as those      dollars were then deposited in central banks all over the      earth, the even larger flood of marks, francs, pounds,      etc., which were thereby unleashed, bid those prices up      even more.    </p>    <p>      Pretty soon, even the duller among us began to realize what      was going on. And not just <em>realize</em> . . . actually      become <em>frightened</em> by the tidal wave of IOU's that      was starting to sweep away the world's established values.    </p>    <p>      Holy Gee Whiz! All of a sudden that flood of IOU's was      pushing up the prices of everything that everyone bought .      . . at the same time it was diluting and eroding away their      savings. People all over the world suddenly began to notice      what was <em>really</em> happening to their paychecks,      their savings, their standards of living. They were all      handling more and more IOU's . . . but those IOU's were      actually buying less and less.    </p>    <p>      It wasn't just a few of the brighter folks now who wanted      something solid, something hard, something <em>real</em> to      hang on to. Dang it! People all over the world wanted to      trade their IOU's for gold . . . and they didn't care who      knew it! And they did trade the worthless paper for U.S.      gold too . . . right up until President Nixon "slammed the      gold window" in their faces in 1971 and told the world      that-sorry!-the United States was no longer      interested in honoring its debts to the rest of the world .      . . was no longer interested in redeeming its IOU's.    </p>    <p>      Now it should be noted right here that all the little folks      who wanted gold in the late 60's and early 70's were not      "bad" people. Nor were the brighter folks who started      cashing in IOU's for gold several years before them "bad '      either. <em>Do not listen to any "official", any government      spokesman or -woman, any</em> <em>head of state who tries      to tell you that "speculators" or other "bad people" have      bid up the price of gold or created a run on the dollar or      otherwise knocked the world's finances out of kilter.</em>      Politicians are always spineless and always try to shift      the blame to completely innocent bystanders after      they-the politicians themselves-have created a      crisis.    </p>    <p>      In this case, the inflation which plagues us now can be      traced direct-back to the Bretton Woods conference . . . in      which foggy-minded politicians and Keynesian economists      deluded each other into believing that they could create      everlasting prosperity with the stroke of a pen. That s      what set the stage for the troubles we currently enjoy . .      . and the terrible, terrible "Day of Reckoning" which still      looms before us.    </p>    <p>      But, of course, a stage needs actors to bring it to life .      . . to help it realize its (in this case, <em>awful</em> )      potential. Luckily for all of us, neither Truman nor      Eisenhower (the first two U.S. Presidents to serve after      Bretton Woods) were high enough rollers to turn that stage      into the living, breathing tragedy that it now has become.      Sure, they both tried-each in his own way-to      squander money on the Cold War, and Foreign Aid, and      national highway programs, and "police actions" around the      world . . . but neither seemed capable of spending IOU's      fast enough to raise the U.S. rate of inflation much above      2% annually while he was in office.    </p>    <p>      Jack Kennedy-with his grandiose space pro g ram and      social ideas-was in a different league entirely. But      even he was a piker compared to Lyndon Johnson . . . who,      in turn, was immediately topped in his economic stupidity      by Richard Nixon.    </p>    <p>      (Watergate-which, as we all know, forced Nixon out of      office in disgrace-was as nothing compared to the      criminal insanity of Tricky Dick's so-called economic      "policy". Nixon <em>had</em> no economic policy, because he      had no interest in economics. Which, perhaps, explains how      he could-seemingly unknowingly-rend the      economic fabric of the world with his incredible deficits,      the slamming of the gold window, tremendous giveaways of      U.S. grain- <em>real wealth</em> -in exchange      for Russian and Chinese IOU's, and a Keystone Kops "Phase      1, Phase 2" wage and price controls policy-designed,      of course, to "punish" the "bad" speculators who were      "causing" inflation-etc., etc., etc.)    </p>    <p>      Thanks to this "policy" we reaped many unpleasant      repercussions, including: the OPEC nations quadrupled the      price of petroleum, the communists (after receiving the      billions of dollars' worth of grain we'd given them on the      cuff) diverted huge new resources to their weapons      programs, we all suddenly found ourselves trying to battle      raging inflation and a dragging near-depression at the same      time, and-in general-everything went to hell in      a hand basket.    </p>    <p>      After that it was a real relief when Jerry Ford stumbled      onto the stage, tripped over his own foot, and bumped his      head. Maybe he <em>was</em> a little awkward while in      office, but Ford (at least in the field of economics) may      yet turn out to be the most underrated President the United      States has ever had.    </p>    <p>      Ole Jerry's evenhanded "steady as she goes" approach, after      all, only pulled the whole world back from the very brink      of economic chaos, confusion, and catastrophe. It      <em>only</em> gave everyone a much-needed breather at a      time when that breather was absolutely essential. It      <em>only</em> showed the rest of the planet that-by      gum!-the U.S. <em>still could</em> produce an      administration which really and truly understood      that-sooner or later-this nation would have to      start living within its means and stop papering the world      with worthless IOU's. My God! Where would we all be right      now if it hadn't been for Jerry?    </p>    <p>      We shouldn't have asked. Because Little Jimmy      Carter-with his incredible deficits, mind-numbing      trade imbalances, capricious tax programs, concessions to      the communists, rudderless "leadership", energy "solution",      and Nixon-like grasp of economics-seems determined to      show us. Hang on, everybody. We're in for a rough ride . .      . and it's downhill all the way. You ain't seen nothin'      yet!    </p>    <p>      Surely, however, you've seen enough to know that only fools      put their trust in politicians (and the central bankers and      economists who serve them). Politicians-sooner or      later- <em>always</em> screw up a good thing. Why?      Because it's simply their nature. Politicians      want-need!-to be loved. <em>That's why</em>      they go into politics in the first place. And that's also      why-once in office-they <em>always</em> start      tinkering with a nation's real money . . . trying to find      ways to buy everyone's love by "giving" all their      constituents everything that everybody's heart desires.    </p>    <p>      Well I've got news for you! Governments can't "give"      anybody anything. Not unless they take it away from someone      first. Because governments don't have anything. <em>There      is</em> <em>no such thing as "federal" money</em> . There      is only the wealth-the goods and services-that      a nation creates when its citizens are gainfully employed.      And the only way a politician can "give" some of that      wealth back to his constituents . . . is by taking it away      from them first.    </p>    <p>      If he's honest, a politician will admit that fact and "pay      as he goes" by taxing everyone heavily enough-day by      day, week by week, month by month, and year by      year-to cover his administration's expenses as      they're incurred.    </p>    <p>      But people don't like to be taxed. And politicians are      seldom honest. And so we wind up with one wimp after      another in office . . . wimps who tax everybody as heavily      as they can get away with, and then pay for the rest of      their flights of fancy with worthless IOU's that-they      hope-someone else (you!) will have to make good      sometime in the future.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, <em>the future</em> is now. Thanks to      Bretton Woods, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon,      and-now-Little Jimmy Carter . . . the world is      once again teetering on the very brink of an absolutely      terrifying economic collapse.    </p>    <p>      "No one wants the dollar anymore," says the Paris financial      daily <em>Les</em> <em>Echos</em> . No one wants the IOU's.      Jimmy Carter is still crankin' them out and trying to force      them down everybody's throat . . . but no one wants paper      promises anymore.    </p>    <p>      Instead, people-and oil producers, and other heads of      state, and farmers, and coal miners, and all the rest of      us-want something solid, something hard, something      real to hold onto. We want gold and silver and goods and      services and our own secure place in the world and some      guarantee that we'll have these things tomorrow and the day      after and the day after that.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately (and it's our own fault because we all      <em>wanted</em> to believe those Sugar Daddies in      Washington), that's not what we're getting these days.    </p>    <p>      Instead, we're all handling more and more IOU's now . . .      and finding that they buy less and less of the things we      need. We're all being kicked up into higher and higher tax      brackets by this paper flood . . . and noticing that we're      no "richer" when we get there. We're all beginning to      realize that our social security and pensions and annuities      and other forms of "income" that we're looking forward to      in our old age . . . probably won't be worth the paper      they're printed on when we start to collect them. We're all      starting to understand that this is the generation which      will have to pay the bills- <em>one way or</em>      <em>another</em> -that the U.S. government has been      running up for the past three or four decades.    </p>    <p>      And those bills-and the interest due upon      them-and the unfunded government commitments that      haven't even come due yet but which "someone" (you!) still      has to cover .. . are staggering. So staggering, in fact,      that there's no longer any use in even guesstimating and      adding them all up together. <em>Because there is      absolutely no way that they can ever be paid.</em>    </p>    <p>      Friends and neighbors, although some of us (including,      apparently, Little Jimmy Carter) don't seem to know it yet      . . . the U.S., the rest of the Free World, and the whole      communist bloc is already bankrupt. We've <em>all</em> been      mortgaging the future so fast and so loose, that none of us      can <em>ever</em> pay off the bills we've run up.    </p>    <p>      Now maybe we can keep the shell game going one more day . .      . maybe another year . . maybe ten. But sooner or later      (and the odds favor sooner . . . <em>much</em> sooner than      most of us yet realize) our financial house of cards is      going to collapse. And when that Great Day of Reckoning      comes, it's going to make the depression of the 30's look      like The Teddy Bears' Picnic by comparison.    </p>    <p>      Friends, for over eight years now, MOTHER has been      suggesting that you invest your faith in yourself and in      real wealth. But, today, she's no longer suggesting . . .      she's <em>recommending in the strongest possible terms</em>      that you do so!    </p>    <p>      Get out of town. Buy a piece of land. Build a snug,      passively solar-heated, underground house. Put up a      windplant and/or a methane generator and/or your own      "farmer's alcohol" distillery and/or other "alternative"      energy systems. Construct a solar greenhouse. Grow a      garden. Raise chickens and/or rabbits and/or a pig or two.      Get a cow or a couple of goats. <em>Become as food</em>      <em>and energy self-sufficient as you can . . . NOW!</em>    </p>    <p>      Improve, increase, and expand your skills. Learn .a trade      that will always be in demand . . . especially if society      as you've always known it falls completely apart. Start      your own business, even if it's just a little part-time      enterprise on the side. Stock up on how-to books, plans,      manuals, and other guides that really tell you how to      provide you and your family with the basics of life. Stash      away as many gold and silver coins, bottles of liquor, good      tools, repair items, and other real wealth as you can . . .      <em>NOW!</em> Even if you don't use them all yourself as      our society plunges into the economic chasm that is      splitting open beneath our feet, you'll find that such      items maintain their value as trade goods no matter how      worthless the government's paper IOU's become. Stock up on      soap, a year's supply of long-term-storage food for every      member of your family, salt, nails, screws, needles,      buttons, and all the other big and little things that      you'll miss the quickest when they're no longer available.      In other words, become as economically <em>self-sufficient      as you can . . . NOW!</em>    </p>    <p>      And, if you don't already have them, lay in some weapons      and a good supply of ammunition . . . <em>NOW!</em> Nobody      likes to talk about such things but, when worst comes to      worst, you're probably going to need them.    </p>    <p>      And what if-through some miracle (it'll have to be a      <em>big</em> one)-things never get that bad?      Wonderful! You II still be way ahead of the game. While      others continue to battle shrinking dollars and expanding      prices . . . while others continue to worry about OPEC oil      embargoes and coal miners' strikes . . . while others      wonder whether or not the farmers really will refuse to      produce food next year . . . while others helplessly watch      their rent and heating bills go on up and up and up . .      you'll be snug in your underground house, counting the jars      of home-canned food in the pantry, and warming your feet on      the passively solar-heated living room floor.    </p>    <h3>      LAST MINUTE ECONOMIC NEWS    </h3>    <p>      <em>As this report went to press, the dollar was hitting      new daily lows on all the world's markets. Gold (remember      gold . . . the metal that our government guaranteed would      always sell for $35 an ounce?) was priced at more than $190      an ounce. Silver had just made its biggest one-day jump in      over two years. The Taft-Hartley Act had been invoked but      the coal miners' strike-which was starting to take      some ugly turns toward violence-still seemed far from      over. The U.S. rate of inflation had suddenly ballooned      once again to over double-digit levels. And the      Swiss-in a desperate effort to stem the flood of      worthless dollars into their country (from anxious      foreigners who wanted to trade the IOU's for gold-backed      Swiss francs)-had, among other equally severe      measures, just imposed a crushing 40% annual tax on all      large foreign holdings of Swiss francs. Germany was      reported to be considering a similar action.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>On the oil front, Iranian Finance Minister Mohammad      Yeganeh was quoted as saying that he favored a review of      OPEC's policy of pricing petroleum in dollars, and newly      appointed Oil Minister Shaikh Ali Khalifa AI-Sabah of      Kuwait had just announced that he thought all the OPEC      nations should attend an emergency meeting to discuss the      continued decline of the dollar. (MOTHER's prediction:      Everything will be up for grabs overnight when-</em>      not <em>"if"-the oil producing countries officially      begin pricing their petroleum in something other than      dollars.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In Japan, the Eidal Company-and four      affiliates-with total liabilities of three-quarters      of a</em> billion dollars <em>had just turned belly-up . .      . and a Japanese bank survey reported that "one out of      every ten companies listed on the Japanese stock exchange      is virtually bankrupt".</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Back home, housing starts were reported down 29% in      January and all the leading indicators were pointing to the      onset of a recession sometime in the second half of 1978 or      the first few months of 1979. Meanwhile, the state of      California faced a massive tax revolt among its property      owners, retail sales were down, the stock market continued      its plunge, and profit margins were dropping for companies      all across the country.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The only "good" news in the whole financial press, in      fact, was a short article in the March 13 issue of Business      Week. The piece reported that, thanks to the current      skyrocketing rates of taxation . . . as much as</em> $195      billion <em>worth of business (10% of the whole economy) is      now conducted "underground". That is: As much as one dollar      out of every ten now spent here in the United States is,      perhaps, spent in purely cash transactions that never get      reported on anyone's tax return. While it is sad to see      that the corruption from on high in Washington has now      filtered all the way down to undermine U.S. citizens'      legendary tax-return honesty . . . it is interesting to      note, once again, that the "little guy" still has his ways      of fighting "The System" that threatens to crush him.</em>    </p>
