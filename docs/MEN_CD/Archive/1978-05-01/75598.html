                   <p>      <strong>THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SEEKS A $17 MILLION CUT      IN</strong> <strong>SOLAR FUNDING FOR 1979,</strong>      according to an internal memo that puts the agency's      fiscal-1979 solar budget at just $373 million (vs. $390      million for the current fiscal year). Funding for nuclear      development would-if the Department had its      way-remain at over $1.5 billion next year, while      fossil fuel spending would increase to $924 million from      the present $848 million. The Department employs more than      1,700 persons in nuclear-related projects, but less than 50      people in wind and solar research.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOVIETS DOUBLE DOMESTIC GASOLINE PRICES.</strong>      In an effort to reduce private driving (and thus ease      demand for fuel), the Soviet Union last March raised the      price of domestic high-octane gasoline to $1.30 a gallon      from 65e per gallon, according to a report in The Wall      Street Journal . Ironically, the Soviet Union is presently      the world's largest producer of crude oil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DOES YOUR POWER COMPANY PROVIDE "EDUCATIONAL      MATERIALS" TO LOCAL SCHOOLS?</strong> If so, Ralph Nader's      Center for the Study of Responsive Law would like to hear      from you. <strong>CSRL</strong> is currently looking into      attempts by utilities (and others) to influence learning in      primary and secondary schools. If you have any leads to      offer, get in touch with Sheila Harty, CSRL, P.O. Box      19367, Washington, D.C. 20036.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU SEE SOLAR HEATING      HARDWARE IN YOUR NEXT SEARS CATALOG.</strong> Sears,      Roebuck and Company has already entered negotiations with      manufacturers of domestic water-heating systems, solar      space heating equipment, and combination heating/cooling      systems, and will begin mass marketing solar equipment this      year (according to a report in Solar Age , $20/yr. from      P.O. Box 4934, Manchester, N.H. 03108). Next in line:      Montgomery Ward and J.C. Penney.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLAMS PLAN NUKE BLOCKADE.</strong> Clamshell      Alliance organizers are planning a blockade of Narragansett      Bay, Cape Cod Canal, and Seabrook Harbor to prevent the      delivery (by barge) of a 427-ton "reactor pressure vassal"      to the site of the now-under-construction Seabrook Nuclear      Station, near Seabrook, New Hampshire. (The exact date of      shipment of the reactor pressure vessel is not yet known.)      Anyone wishing to participate in the blockade-or in the      planned June 24 occupation of the Seabrook      plant-should contact the Clamshell Alliance at 62      Congress St., Portsmouth, N.H. 03801.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIESEL-POWERED AUTOS CONTINUE TO GAIN IN      POPULARITY</strong> as new-car buyers begin to appreciate      the diesel's 25% fuel-efficiency advantage over standard      gasoline engines. Oldsmobile plans to produce 600 diesel      engines a day by year's end. Volkswagen expects to sell      45,000 diesel-powered Rabbits in 1978 . . . more than three      times the number sold in 1977. Likewise, Mercedes-Benz      concedes that this year, more than half of its U.S.      deliveries will be diesel. One General Motors official has      gone so far as to predict that by 1985, one-fifth of all      cars coming out of Detroit will have diesel engines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POWER FROM WOOD CHIPS: A $65 MILLION VOTE OF      CONFIDENCE.</strong> Residents of Burlington, Vermont (pop.      38,800) recently voted-by a 70Â°7o margin-to      approve $65 million in bond issues to build two power      plants fueled by wood chips and other locally available      materials. (One plant will supply steam and hot water . . .      the other will provide the city with 50,000 kilowatts of      electricity.) "The coal strike had a lot to do with the      resounding vote to develop alternate fuel sources," says      one Burlington spokesman.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE MOST COMPLETE SOLAR EQUIPMENT CATALOG IN THE      WORLD?</strong> Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. All we know is      that we've never seen a meatier, more informative      alternative energy "wish book" than the 224-page 1978 Solar      Usage Now Catalog. Shopping for collectors? Glazings?      Parabolic reflectors? Thermostats? Heat exchangers? Books?      Blowers? Water heaters? You'll find all these      things-and much, much more-in the latest SUN      Catalog. To get your copy, send $2.00 to SUN at Box 306,      Dept. TMEN, Bascom, Ohio 44809. You'll be amazed!    </p>    <p>      <strong>ATOMIC ACRONYMS DEPT.:</strong> The Nuclear      Regulatory Commission has done away with its      <strong>MUF</strong> (radioactive "materials unaccounted      for") problems once and for all. Henceforth, missing      uranium will be described not by the term      <strong>MUF</strong> , but by <strong>ID</strong>      ("inventory difference") . . . . State Representative John      Galbraith has introduced <strong>A</strong> <strong>BILL IN      THE OHIO LEGISLATURE TO ABOLISH WINTER.</strong> Says      Galbraith: "This bill makes as much sense as many others      relating to the energy crisis (that have been] enacted by      the General Assembly" . . . . <strong>PEOPLE &</strong>      <strong>ENERGY HAS CHANGED PUBLISHERS (AND      ADDRESSES)</strong> . The $10/yr. alternative-energy      newsletter is now put out by the Citizens' Energy Project,      1413 "K" St. N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20005 . . .      . The FBI is investigating the circumstances surrounding a      recent attempt by "European commodity traders" to      <strong>SELL</strong> <strong>WESTINGHOUSE CORPORATION 239      POUNDS OF BLACK MARKET URANIUM.</strong> The sellers      reportedly wanted $288 million in cash . . . . <strong>THE      FIRST LARGE WINDPLANT TO FEED AN AMERICAN UTILITY      GRID</strong> since the 1941 Smith-Putnam windmill at      Grandpa's Knob, Vermont went "on line" earlier this year in      Clayton, New Mexico. The DOE-funded machine provides the      town with 200 kilowatts of power . . . . <strong>DOMESTIC      SHIPMENTS<br /></strong> <strong>OF HEAT PUMPS SOARED TO      48,495 UNITS IN JANUARY 1978,</strong> an increase of 51%      over the number of shipments made by U.S. manufacturers a      year earlier . . . . Nuclear America-a large (17" X      22" ) color poster showing <strong>THE LOCATIONS OF MORE      THAN 200 NUCLEAR FACILITIES (OF ALL KINDS) IN THE      U.S.</strong> -is available for just 75 cents from      the War Resisters League, 339 Lafayette St., New York, N.Y.      10012 . . . . Speaking of nuclear odds and ends, we're told      that Britain's Friends of the Earth (9 Poland St., London      W1V 3DG, England) has come out with a T-shirt that says:      <strong>"THE ONLY SAFE FAST BREEDER IS A RABBIT!"</strong>    </p>
