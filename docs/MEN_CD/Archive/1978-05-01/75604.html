                       		<hr />    <p>      <strong>Friends of the Earth is one of the most effective      environmental groups</strong> <strong>in the world today.      Although FOE publishes its own journal-a monthly      tabloid called <em>Not Man Apart</em> -far too few of      MOTHER's readers regularly see a copy of <em>NMA</em> . . .      which is why we've agreed to publish this column, written      by the FOE/NMA staff.</strong>    </p>    <h3>NEW MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE COLORADO      RIVER</h3>    <p>      The National Park Service, which oversees the      overwhelmingly beautiful Grand Canyon National Park, is      about to adopt a new management plan for the Colorado River      portion of the park . . . and Friends of the Earth thinks      the proposals offered to date will help ensure cleaner,      safer, and more peaceful recreation for all parties using      the river.    </p>    <p>      In short, the plan will: [1] increase the number of      visitors using the Park-and distribute their use more      evenly throughout the year-by lengthening the summer season      and establishing a winter season, [2] handle non-commercial      permit applications on a first-come, first-served basis,      [3] prohibit wood fires in summer and insist that group      members use fire pans and remove all charcoal taken in, [4]      require that each trip haul out all human wastes generated      by its party, [5] designate a single trail at each heavily      visited site and discourage off-trail walking,      and-perhaps most controversial of all-[6] phase      out motorized boats and rafts over a three-year period      (1979-1981).    </p>    <p>      Public comments about the recommended policy (many of which      were gathered at open meetings held during March) will be      considered before a final plan is drafted.    </p>    <h3>MINNESOTA FARMERS PROTEST HIGH-VOLTAGE      LINES</h3>    <p>      The modest village of Lowry, Minnesota-which, until      recently, was no more politicized than any average small      farming community-is now calling itself "the Bunker      Hill of the 20th century" (or so reads a sign tacked on the      firehouse wall).    </p>    <p>      The reason: 40 of the town's residents were arrested last      January because they violated an injunction against      hindering work crews that were surveying land for      high-voltage power-lines . . . or, as the accused look at      it, because they were "striking a blow for freedom" from      the influential power companies, which have won the right      to erect their enormous metal towers in "convenient" spots      to carry electricity from central generating plants      throughout the state.    </p>    <p>      Farmers in other parts of Minnesota are likewise up in arms      over the prospect of the 400-kilovolt, direct current lines      which may soon crisscross their croplands. Besides the      obvious problems of maneuvering machinery and irrigation      gear around the towers, the rural residents fear a buildup      of electrical charges in their fences and equipment. As the      <em>Minneapolis</em> <em>Tribune</em> summarized the      farmers' view, "The race for new energy will trample their      farms, affecting their property, their income, their sense      of partnership with the land, their relished sense of      isolation from city problems, and maybe even their health."    </p>    <p>      Understandably, the farmers feel helpless in the face of      the utility companies' ability simply to condemn land they      need for right-of-ways through an almost automatic process      of hearings and appraisals. Though even reluctant      landowners wind up with a cash settlement, they also      involuntarily lose some of the property their families may      have worked for generations.    </p>    <p>      The power companies, of course, see the situation      differently. As one utility spokesman stated, "We literally      have one million people in this state who depend on us for      power, and if the lines aren't built, there are going to be      a lot of people without lights. Say there are 1,000      protesters . . . they're a small minority. What about the      rights of the others?"    </p>    <p>      The immediate situation has become even more crucial      because five or six similar large-scale projects are being      planned for Minnesota's countryside in the next decade. As      a result, the Governor has already called for a Science      Court to investigate potential health damage caused by the      high-voltage lines (construction, nevertheless, is still      underway).    </p>    <p>      The dissatisfied farmers, meanwhile, have staged additional      civil protests (on January 23, for instance, more than      1,000 individuals went to the state capital to try to      convince their legislators to invoke a moratorium on      building until the Science Court concludes its      investigation). They've also started legal battles against      the power companies (at this writing, two suits are pending      in Federal District Court: one arguing civil rights and the      other charging that the preliminary environmental impact      statement on one project was inadequate).    </p>    <p>      No one knows the solution to this dilemma, though at least      one leader of the scattered anti-powerline      groups-physics professor Wendell Bradley-has      come up with a compromise: smaller, decentralized plants      which would require fewer powerlines and cause less      concentrated pollution. The utilities, of course, counter      that such a system is not economical. The courts will have      to decide.    </p>   <h3>NEW INFORMATION-PACKED POSTER</h3>    <p>      Did you ever wonder how you could keep your Brillo pad from      rusting . . . or how to clean an oven without using a      dangerous chemical? Maybe you're concerned about food      additives, over-packaging, or the proper insecticide for      your garden? Ever want a short statement on what's wrong      with nuclear power, road salt, and aerosols, or exactly      which cars are easiest on gas . . . but just couldn't put      your finger on the information?    </p>    <p>      If you could use answers to these questions-or to      hundreds of others that any environmentally concerned      person might ask-then a new poster from a Canadian      environmental group, Pollution Probe, will be well worth      your $2.00 investment. Despite the fact that "The      Unfinished Agenda" (a 34" X 22" poster printed front and      back) was published with Canadians-and Toronto      residents specifically-in mind, it contains enough      info to become one of the most useful items in      <em>anyone's</em> house.    </p>    <p>      To obtain your copy of this handy "action" poster, send      $2.00 to: Pollution Probe, 43 Queen's Park Crescent East,      Toronto, Ont., Canada M5S 2C3.    </p>    <h3>NEWSBRIEFS</h3>    <p>      A small California company, Sun-Wind Ltd., has developed a      prototype wind-powered automobile that has already attained      speeds of 55 mph in 13 mph crosswinds with no additional      energy input . . . . Folks who try to improve gas mileage      by tampering with their automobile's emission control      system will soon find themselves under the gun of the new      Clean Air Act amendments . . . . Researchers at the      Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have found that a      method of detecting breast cancer by measuring body      temperature (Graphic Stress Tele-thermometry) is 80 percent      accurate. The procedure-which appears to be      completely safe-could replace the questionable      practice of mammography for the preliminary screening of      women undergoing a checkup.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>To become a member of Friends of the Earth-and      receive their excellent publication, Not</em> <em>Man      Apart, year round-remit $20 to FOE at 124 Spear, San      Francisco, Calif. 94,105.-MOTHER.</em>    </p>
