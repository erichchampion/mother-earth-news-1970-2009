    <p>
                            <p>      Sure, MOTHER has already told you about ultra-low-cost      semi-subterranean and underground solar-tempered houses.      (William T. Beale's 16' X 30', $6,000 Athens, Ohio guest      house, for instance . . . or the Andy Davis $15,000,      1,200-square-foot "cave" dwelling up in Armington,      Illinois.)    </p>    <p>      And she's told you how incredibly energy efficient such      beneath-the-surface homes can be. (The Davis family, as      you'll recall, heated their place during the catastrophic      winter of 1976/77 for a grand total of $1.29.)    </p>    <p>      And she's pointed out many of the other good things about      underground houses. (How quiet and peaceful they can be . .      . the protection they offer from tornadoes and other storms      . . . the fact that they can be brighter and far airier      than most aboveground dwellings . . . the ease with which      they can be cooled during the summer . . . and so on and on      and on.)    </p>    <p>      In short, it has become all too obvious to the editors of      this magazine-and to a great number of other folks      who've seriously studied the situation-that      subterranean homes are very definitely going to become more      and more important as we all hurtle into a resource-poor,      harsh-climated, overpopulated, and crisis-ridden future.    </p>    <p>      Despite all that, however, we are well aware that most      members of our society have yet to discover underground      housing-and the many benefits it offers-at all.      And that the growing section of society which has become      aware of subterranean dwellings . . . well, still generally      tends to think of them as somehow "not as good" as the      flimsy, overpriced and over mortgaged, expensive to heat      and cool, aboveground, stick buildings almost all of us now      live in.    </p>    <p>      This attitude is not entirely rational, of course, but then      very few people any longer maintain that the human race is      always rational. Think back to your old high school days:      Remember? If the freshmen in a school started a fad . . .      that was usually as far as it went. But if the      <em>seniors</em> in another school started wearing the very      same new style of clothing or using the same distinctive      new greeting or whatever . . . it wasn't long before the      fashion had spread to <em>everyone</em> in the building.    </p>        <p>      Now we've kinds, got a hunch that that's what's been      happening with underground houses so far. Almost all the      subterranean dwellings (at least the ones we've heard      about) constructed up to this point . . . have been built      by "ordinary" people, for themselves, on a very tight      budget, and off in an out-of-the-way spot somewhere. Which      is to say that the trend is still being promoted by      "freshmen" . . . good people (darn good people! ), but the      kind of folks that-at least in this field-our      society chooses not to take too seriously.    </p>    <p>      What we <em>need,</em> then-to really get this very      important movement off the ground-is for a whole      batch of "seniors" to jump on the subterranean dwelling      bandwagon. That is: Joe Suburb is going to keep right on      turning his nose up at underground houses and all the      fantastic advantages they offer . . . until he starts      seeing real contractors building prestigious and very      expensive below-grade homes in some of the ritzier      neighborhoods out by the country club golf course. <em>And      then</em> ole Joe is going to start yammering for his very      own underground house so loud and so quick that this      "revolution in residences" is going to sweep the country      overnight.    </p>    <p>      And that's why we were so happy when we first heard about a      new dwelling now being shown off near Columbus, Ohio. Sure,      it's underground . . . it's largely passively solar-heated      . . . it's quiet and vibration-free and very private inside      . . . its interior is also unbelievably bright, and light,      and airy . . . its pipes will never freeze . . . its      exterior will never need maintenance . . . it will never be      blown away by a tornado . . . etc., etc., etc. <em>But far      more important than that:</em> This particular underground      house is contractor-built, it's plush, it's expensive, it      looks <em>great</em> . . . and it's located on the      northwest corner of Columbus in the "ultra ultra" suburb of      Westerville.    </p>    <p>      The designers and contractors responsible for the lovely      home you see here are extremely serious about passively      solar-heated underground housing. So serious, in fact, that      they've formed an architectural/construction      firm-Solar-Earth Energy, Inc.-expressly for the      purpose of designing and building such dwellings. It's also      interesting to note that the partners in the company      "really get into their work" too: One of those partners      (Buck Vaile) and his family have been living in the very      house shown on these pages since last November.    </p>    <p>      Buck reports that his family used no fossil fuels at all,      only a few hours of electricity, and a mere 1-1/4 cords of      wood (burned in a Jøtul stove) to heat their      2,038-square-foot residence during the past unusually cold      winter. Which is exceptional . . . especially when you      realize just how many bitterly cold, completely overcast      days that Columbus, Ohio suffered through earlier this      year.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER has already covered the basics of good subterranean,      passively solar-heated design (build in plenty of drainage      around your structure, waterproof the dwelling's exterior      wall, put insulation on the <em>outside</em> of the house's      mass to turn the whole residence into one gigantic "thermal      flywheel" that will coast right through all the high and      low temperatures of a year's weather, "point" the      building's largest expanses of glass-duo-paned and      fitted with insulated shutters or drapes-south for      winter solar energy collection, place an overhang over      those windows to shade them from the high summer sun, etc.)      so often that we won't repeat them again here. (See one of      the sidebars with this article if you need a crash course      in this subject, which can save your family tens-even      hundreds!-of thousands of dollars during the next few      decades.)    </p>    <p>      We will, however, point out that Buck Vaile and his SEE,      Inc. partners were well aware of all those basics and used      them to good advantage when they constructed Buck's new      home. And we'll mention a couple of additional twists of      their own that the SEE boys also incorporated into the      residence.    </p>    <p>      First off, there's the "solaratrium" located on the north      side of the underground house . . . between the living      quarters themselves and an above-ground garage and storage      area. The solaratrium's roof extends up above the earth's      surface and is covered with transparent fiberglass sheets      which are angled south to collect as much winter sunlight      as possible.    </p>    <p>      The Vaile home does gain some wintertime solar energy      passively from this sun room. Much of the warmth collected      by the solaratrium, however, would just rise to the top of      the 1-1/2 story room and stay there . . . except for a      small fan installed in the house. The blower pulls the      stratified thermal energy down through a duct running up to      the top of the atrium, and distributes the heat to any      areas that need additional warmth.      (Another-exhaust-fan near the sun room's roof      will expel any unwanted heat which builds up in the atrium      during the summer.)    </p>    <p>      Secondly, the SEE crew has built 60 square feet of active      hydronic solar collectors into the roof of the Valle home's      garage/storage area. These collectors supplementally heat      the household's water.    </p>    <p>      As Buck explains the systems: "We have passive solar space      heat supplemented by what we call "hybrid" solar space heat      from the solaratrium and active solar water heating. The      entire package didn't add more than $3,000 to the cost of      the house, though, and we feel it was money well spent."    </p>    <p>      For backup and additional warmth during the coldest part of      the winter, the SEE home is outfitted with a Jøtul      woodburning "firestove" (which consumed less than $100      worth of fuel last winter!). A duct directly above the      stove collects heat which a fan then pushes to other parts      of the house.    </p>    <p>      The sun-tempered underground dwelling is also equipped with      baseboard electric heaters "mainly for reassurance and to      please the bank". These heaters were used only in the      youngest children's room a few nights at the heights of the      winter's worst blizzards and once in a while in the      bathrooms when someone was showering.    </p>    <p>      The SEE designers and builders were just as clever when it      came to using the sun's rays for illumination in the Valle      home. Every major room in the house gets abundant natural      light from either the solaratrium or the windows across the      front of the dwelling. Enough light streams in, in fact, to      grow houseplants throughout the building . . . and food can      even be grown in the atrium when it's used as a greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      Claustrophobiacs should be further reassured to learn that      the interior color scheme (it reflects light) of the Valle      house contributes a great deal to the open, roomy, bright      feel of the structure. This feeling is enhanced even more      by the building's ceilings . . . which are      nine-instead of the usual eight-feet high.    </p>    <p>      To put it another way, everything about this SEE, Inc.      dwelling is first class. From its oversized rooms, to the      materials used throughout, to the careful thought that went      into every facet of its siting and design, to the use of      the natural light and heat which enters the structure, to      the very expensive neighborhood in which the building is      located . . . nothing has been stinted. And the price tag      on the house-$122,000-certainly reflects the      fact.    </p>    <p>      If you find that figure a little rich for your blood,      though, don't panic. Thanks to this plush "showplace"      (remember the senior class back in high school), interest      in passively solar heated underground dwellings is starting      to boom up Columbus, Ohio way. SEE, Inc. has already been      commissioned to construct <em>five</em> more houses of the      same general design . . . and some of them will cost only      half as much as the original (the rest of the "school" is      rushing to get in on the act).    </p>    <p>      And there's even better news yet: Buck Valle tells MOTHER      that SEE, Inc. is just as anxious to promote passively      sun-tempered underground dwellings- <em>whether or      not SEE, Inc. builds them</em> -as we hope you are to      give such a structure a try. For this reason, the firm      stands ready to license other qualified contractors to      fabricate SEE, Inc. designs.    </p>    <p>      And the best news of all: Solar-Earth Energy, Inc. is also      putting together an information packet (available for      $5.00) which contains further details about the house you      see here and other SEE, Inc. designs. In addition to that,      the company is assembling a $500 construction manual so      <em>detailed</em> . . . that "almost anyone" should be able      to use it to build his or her own SEE, Inc. design for tens      of thousands of dollars less than a contractor-fabricated      version of the same house. Send your $5.00 to Solar-Earth      Energy, Inc., Dept. TMEN, 1695 Kenny Rd., Columbus, Ohio      43212. The information packet you'll receive in return will      tell you all about this exciting program.    </p>    <h3>      A PRIMER ON PASSIVELY SOLAR HEATED UNDERGROUND HOUSES    </h3>        <p>      Regular MOTHER readers know that this magazine has been      championing warm, safe, snug, stormproof, easy to      (passively solar) heat and cool underground houses for some      time. If this is your first exposure to the idea, however,      here's how to learn more about the subject:    </p>    <p>      Start with "The Beale Solar-Heated Subterranean Guest      House", pages 80-81, in MOTHER NO. 45. Then move on      to MOTHER NO. 46's Plowboy Interview with Andy Davis (in      which Andy tells how he built a 1,200-square-foot,      three-bedroom underground home-which looks like      $60,000-for only $15,000 in northern Illinois . . .      and how he heated the building during the winter of 1976177      for the ridiculously low sum of $1.29).    </p>    <p>      Next up will be The Plowboy Interview with David Wright in      MOTHER NO. 47. David has designed over 30 "sun tempered"      and "passively solar conditioned" houses . . . and the      interview was conducted in his present (97% heating and      cooling self-sufficient) home on the coast of northern      California.    </p>    <p>      Then, to learn how Jesse Savell-a contractor in      Cotton, California-builds aboveground structures that      are almost as energy efficient as the underground dwellings      covered by the rest of the pieces listed here-read      "Here's a Passively Heated and Cooled House That You Can      Afford . . . and Will Want", pages 116-118, in MOTHER      NO. 48.    </p>    <p>      "Landis and Pamela Gores' Semi-Subterranean 'House for all      Seasons"', pages 64-65, MOTHER NO. 49, has another      somewhat different slant on the subject. And "The Paul      Isaacson Family Lives in the House of the Future", pages      101-103, MOTHER NO. 50, introduces still another      passively solar heated, underground dwelling viewpoint,      design, and method of construction.    </p>    <p>      (See pages 66-67 of this issue for information on how      to order MOTHER's back issues.)    </p>    <h3>      THE INCREDIBLE "SAVERSHOWER" WATER AND ENERGY SAVER    </h3>    <p>      In their never-ending pursuit of energy savings, Buck Valle      and the other good folks at SEE, Inc. recently tested a      unique new shower head called the "SaverShower". And the      gadget, they found, immediately reduced their hot water      consumption so dramatically . . . that SEE, Inc. has      acquired a dealership for the whole line of "Saver"      fixtures and is now pushing them just as zestfully as the      firm promotes its energy-conserving houses.    </p>    <p>      In fact, Buck Valle made a special trip all the way from      SEE, Inc.'s home base of Columbus, Ohio to MOTHER'S offices      in Hendersonville, North Carolina a few days ago . . . just      to tell this magazine's editors about this rather amazing      energy- and water-saving (and sewage-reducing) device.    </p>    <p>      As Buck pointed out: "Few families yet realize the almost      unbelievable amount of money the typical household shells      out every year for hot water. Which, in turn, makes it a      little difficult sometimes to understand just how much one      of these simple $12.95 shower heads can shave off the      average annual electric bill. Believe it or not, though,      our tests have shown us that those savings can easily add      up to $120 a year. That's nearly a 1,000 return on your      investment every 12 months!"    </p>    <p>      Buck then went on to explain how this rather incredible      savings is made possible. "Water typically flows from a      conventional shower head at the rate of eight to ten      gallons per minute. Leave that shower running for 10      minutes or more, and you've just used 100 gallons of water      . . . much of it heated. The average rate of flow from a      SaverShower head, on the other hand, is only 2.2 gallons      per minute. Let it run for the same length of time . . .      and you've cut your water and water-heating bill for the      bath by at least 60 %."    </p>    <p>      "Yes, but . . . " we immediately yes-butted, "it looks to      us as if you'll also cut your skintingling enjoyment of the      shower by at least the same 60 %. And it also seems logical      to suppose that-to get clean-you'll probably      have to stay under the spray at least 60% longer."    </p>    <p>      Well sir, there was only one way Buck could cap the      discussion . . . and he had it at his fingertips. Digging      into his pocket, he pulled out two SaverShowers and said.      "Here. Test 'em yourself. Get a gallon container and a      watch or clock with a second hand and see how quickly your      present shower head fills the bucket. Next, install a      SaverShower and time it. Then bathe with the thing and you      tell me whether or not you find the bath satisfying and how      long it takes you to get clean."    </p>    <p>      Two of MOTHER's people-Emerson Smyers and Roger      Hoffmann (sweaty Roger, the guy who runs 12 miles a      day)-accepted the challenge. Both took a SaverShower      home, both tried the gizmo, and both reported: The shower      felt great . . . every bit as refreshing as before the      installation. And, while it took the same amount of time as      usual to get clean, the SaverShower bath definitely      consumed a lot less water."    </p>    <p>      But don't take Roger's and Emerson's word for it: Get your      own SaverShower and see for yourself. A deluxe head is      available for $12.95, a standard model for $9.95, and a      sink aerator (which will allow you to save in the kitchen      too) sells for $1.95 from Solar-Earth Energy, Inc., Dept.      TMEN, 1695 Kenny Rd., Columbus, Ohio 43212. Include an      additional 75 cents (shipping and handling) for each shower      head or aerator you order and tell 'em MOTHER sent you.    </p>    <p>      And Roger and Emerson, you can bring back the test      SaverShowers now. Roger . . . Emerson. Hey, you guys!      Remember those shower heads that we gave you to test? Roger      . . . Emerson?    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you like the house you see here,      you'll be pleased to learn that MOTHER has made some      special arrangements with SEE, Inc.
