    <p>
                  <p>      Seed savers usually face (or avoid, actually) the danger of      cross-pollination between different species of squash,      pumpkin, cucumber, etc., by resorting to growing a single      variety. In McMinnville, Oregon, however, Floyd Moore has      devised a better way to deal with the problem of potential      mix-ups. A day or so before the female blossom (the one      with the little pumpkin or squash or whatever at its base)      opens up, just snap a small rubber band around the end of      the petals. After a couple of days remove this retainer      and-with a cotton swab or a camelhair brush-do      your <em>own</em> pollination. Then replace the rubber band      and tie an additional color-coded band around the stem so      that-when harvest time rolls around-you'll know      which plants contain true-to-type seeds . . . and which are      your own hybrids.    </p>		<hr />        <p>      " 'Chris's shelves' (named for the friend who taught me      this construction method) require a minimum of materials      and only a little labor," says Rich Weinhold of Redding,      California. Sound appealing? You bet it does! A hammer,      pliers with a wire cutter, a tape measure, and perhaps a      stud finder and level are all that's needed for the      installation. And the only materials required are the shelf      boards of your choice, common or box nails, and some twine      or wire. Each shelf (see diagram) is supported at stud      intervals (thus the probable need for a stud finder), rests      on nails driven into the wall, and hangs at the front by      the twine or wire.    </p>    <p>      The initial step in this construction process is to locate      the studs and determine the desired height of each shelf.      Leave 1/2" to 3/4" of each nail exposed in order to be able      to wrap the twine (or wire) around at points B and C . . .      as well as to support the shelf at point A. Front-to-rear      leveling is then achieved easily by simply wrapping turns      of the twine about the supporting nails to get the desired      angle.    </p>    <p>      And-of particular interest to apartment and home      renters (and landlords)-these shelves are inexpensive      enough to leave for the next tenant. However, if you do      choose to take your shelves with you when you depart the      premises, the nail holes can easily be filled with Spackle      and will be almost invisible. (To do this properly, though,      place a small block of wood beneath the head of the hammer      as you "claw" the fasteners out.) Thanks to Rich      <em>and</em> Chris for this portable shelf idea.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Naturally enough, a clean wood shingle-or any other      type for that matter-roof is gonna last longer than a      dirty one. The problem is turning the latter into the      former . . . preferably without crawling around the top of      your house on your hands and knees scraping accumulations      of moss and dirt from individual shingles. Tom Zeitler of      Suring, Wisconsin handles this usually unpleasant chore      with a minimum hassle by sprinkling lime freely along just      the peak of the housetop. The enterprising Mr. Zeitler then      lets the rain do the work. Which it does by dissolving the      lime, spreading it over the other shingles, thereby      removing just about every particle of moss and other      accumulated debris.<br />    </p>    <p>      An instant greenhouse can be fashioned from an old car      body, suggests Maple Valley, Washington's Blanche Haynes,      provided the vehicle's windows are still intact. Just      arrange your plant flats, crates, and other containers      within the cleaned-out automobile hull in whatever way you      think will make for the most convenient watering and      tending. Make it easy on yourself. And, for daytime      ventilation, just crank open a window or two. Maybe you'll      even find a vehicle (planter) with a <em>sun</em> roof!    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Got a screen door, an outhouse door, or perhaps just a      small gate that you'd like to close automatically? Well,      those long coil springs made for just that purpose are nice      but-as James Tinger of Hermitage, Tennessee points      out-you don't need 'em if there's an old inner tube      handy . . . and there almost always is. Cut a 2"-wide strip      the length you need (it'll depend on the distance your door      or gate swings) from the tube. Then fold over 1" of each      end of the length of rubber and fasten the stretcher to the      door, gate, fence, etc. (using nails or screws attached to      1" X 1" X 2" wood blocks). You'll laugh-in      admiration-at the simple practicality of this      down-home idea.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      If you <em>do</em> have an inner tube-especially from      a truck tire-that's being cut up for whatever reason      . . . save that valve stem. Why? To make a simple-but      effective-compression tester for your machine,      whether it's a car, truck, tractor, or rototiller. Just      take an old spark plug from the vehicle to be tested and      break away the glass part of the electrode, leaving the      metal threaded portion intact. Then take that truck tube      air valve you've been holding on to and braze it to the      threaded (now glassless) section of the plug. Screw the new      "tester" into the spark plug hole of the machine you're      testing and apply air pressure-with a pump, f' r      instance-through the air valve. According to Joe      Chasse of Renton, Washington (who sent us this little      trick), if you then hear air at the exhaust pipe you've got      a bad exhaust valve . . . air detected at the carburetor      means a bad intake valve . . . and air at the breather      outlet indicates bad rings.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Don't despair over a burned pot or pan. We all blacken      cooking utensils from time to time. The question is what to      do about it. Easy. Clean the blackened utensil as best you      can with conventional methods (scrubbing, scraping,      soaking, cursing). Then pour salt in it and fill the pot or      pan with at least two inches of the seasoning if the sides      are also burnt.    </p>    <p>      Next heat the salt-laden dish, occasionally stirring its      contents around. After the salt is thoroughly heated remove      the pot and let it-and the seasoning-cool.      Then, when you pour off the salt, the burnt sides and      bottom of the pan-in the form of ash-should      pour off as well!    </p>    <p>      Although Iona Westwood of Laytonville, California would be      hesitant to try this method with enamelware, she's used      it-with good results and no warping-on cast      iron, aluminum, and stainless steel.    </p>    <p>      And don't throw away that salt after you've used it! Iona      says you can just heat it up again (ash and all) and pour      it into a sack or sturdy pillowcase for a down-home "hot      water bottle". Tie off the top of the bag and wrap your new      creation in a towel. It'll stay hot for hours . . . and is      a good "salt of the earth" treatment for earaches,      backaches, and just plain warming your footsies!    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Summer is good ole-fashioned barbecue time and you've      probably got the grill out already. Problem is, though,      often there are coals or briquettes left over      <em>after</em> you've done your cooking . . . and that fuel      usually ends up going to waste. It doesn't <em>have</em> to      be that way, though, not if you do as Ivan Gossage of      Portola, California does.    </p>    <p>      Take a pail of water and-using a pair of      tongs-drop the hot briquettes into the water.      (They'll steam and spew, so stand back aways.) At first the      little chunks of fuel will float . . . then eventually sink      to the bottom. Good. Fish the wet coals out with the tongs      and let 'em dry. Then bag up the recycled charcoal and      it'll be all ready for your next outdoor feast!    </p>			<hr />    <p>      Tree stumps can be a real nuisance, but Larry Halton has      come up with an ingenious way of removing them from his      DeSoto, Missouri land. First cut the top and bottom out of      an empty metal 55-gallon drum. Then make a 6-inch hole in      the side of the barrel, near the base, to provide a draft.    </p>    <p>      Dig a "moat" around-and a few inches out      from-the stump you're trying to get rid of . . .      place the drum (a 55-gallon drum is approximately 23" in      diameter) down over the stump . . . and start a fire in the      barrel. Your portable stove will burn what's left of the      tree down below ground level in about 24 hours, more or      less, depending on the size of the stump.    </p>			<hr />    <p>      Donna Bartz of Hingham, Massachusetts informs us that her      great-uncle always kept a couple of goldfish-gold in      color, anyway-in the indoor watering tank that he'd      fashioned for his horses from a half of an oak barrel. The      presence of the tinny creatures kept the algae from growing      in the tank and-whether it was fish sense or horse      sense-each time after the horses drank, the fish were      still swimming around. A good country example of a true      symbiotic, one hand washes (and watches) the other      relationship.    </p>			<hr />    <p>      A big, shiny sheet of glass on your desk top looks good,      feels good . . . even allows your special papers to show      through for a quick-and-easy reference. Unfortunately,      quarter-inch glass-which is what you need-is      expensive. Doug Firebaugh of Freeport, Illinois, however,      has a way around the excessive cost. He gets old bureau      mirrors at garage and household sales. Then, with 50  cents'      worth of nitric acid and a good pair of rubber gloves, Doug      cleans the silver from the back of the mirror      and-voila!-has a good-sized desktop cover of      clear glass at a fraction of "new" cost.    </p>			<hr />    <p>      A little behavioral psychology applied by Wendy Parsons of      Endeavour, Saskatchewan is keeping her cow from kicking      over the milk pail. It seems that if you tie a      rope-very tightly!-around a balky cow's middle      just in front of her udder, the cow will lose a great deal      of the interest she had in kicking. (It gets uncomfortable      <em>real</em> quick.) Then, as ole Bossy starts to lose her      bad habit, you can gradually put the rope on looser and      looser at milking time. Eventually, if she's got any memory      at all, you'll be able to just lay the rope across her back      (as a gentle reminder) and she still won't kick you or the      bucket!    </p>			<hr />    <p>      Paul Houston of Allons, Tennessee has been intrigued by the      various ways MOTHER's staffers have used old refrigerators,      and he's come up with a few unusual applications of his      own.    </p>    <p>      Seems the worn-out coolers make ideal <em>worm</em>      <em>beds</em> for Paul's worm farm . . . both the inner and      outer cabinets. (The outer shells should have all the gook      and insulating material thoroughly cleaned away, of course,      as the fiberglass strands, etc., would probably kill any      worms that came in contact with them.) Paul also mixes up      worm bedding (before putting his little wigglers into the      mix) in another recycled fridge . . . and-after      closing off a few holes in its cabinet-he's found yet      another of the old "cold chests" an ideal container to soak      his worms' peat moss in.    </p>    <p>      Then too, Paul has found that reclaimed reefers are ideal      storage cabinets for power tools and paint. Just screw 3/4"      X 1" cleats as desired to the inside walls and cut shelves      the approximate size from 518" plywood sheeting. And, by      adding a scrap piece of one-inch water pipe for a hanger      rod, the big shells become sturdy shop closets that are      ideal for rain gear, dirty clothes, and the like.    </p>			<hr />    <p>      Whether for economic or ecological reasons you      can't-or don't want to-use steel wool to scrub      your pots, try this tip from Lois L. Oswald of Saxonburg,      Pennsylvania.    </p>    <p>      Get a short length of small, rough old steel chain and      fasten the ends into a circle. Then just wrap a few strips      of cloth around the chain and you've got a scrubber that'll      pretty well last forever.    </p>    <p>      Sand or pebbles also make good scrubbers and can be found      (and disposed of) anywhere. Just drop the sand or stones in      the bottom of the pan, add a bit of water, and scrub away.    </p>			<hr />        <p>      And if you don't want to try chains, pebbles, or sand . . .      hang onto those plastic mesh onion bags! Bundle 'em up in      the kitchen and use the little scrubbers to do just that .      . . scrub your pots and pans. But Gayl Washington of      Deposit, New York doesn't even stop there in her recycling      of these empty onion holders.    </p>    <p>      Put a bar of soap in one of the bags, tie both ends, and      you've got a great "scrubber" for feet, ankles, whatever!      The mesh keeps hair from clinging to the soap and prevents      chips of soap from clogging the drain.    </p>    <p>      And for an attractive, mouse-proof bread box, Gayl says to      just paint a rural mailbox to match your kitchen decor.      It'll be a surefire conversation piece and-when      you're out of bread-just raise the flag to remind      yourself!    </p>			<hr />    <p>      <em>OK. Now it's YOUR turn!
