                  <p>      <strong>THE WORLD'S POPULATION GROWTH RATE HAS (FINALLY)      BEGUN TO DECLINE.</strong> Latest U.N. statistics show that      the rate of growth of the earth's population peaked in 1970      at 1.9% per year and has since fallen to 1.7% per year      (meaning that it will now take 41 years for the world's      population to double, instead of the 36 years it would have      taken in 1970). That's the good news. The bad news is that      if the rate of population increase in developing countries      holds steady at its present value of 2.1% per year, food      production will have to double every 25 years just to keep      up with present supply levels, which are manifestly      inadequate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ONE-FIFTH OF ALL THE FOOD PRODUCED IN THE U.S. IS      LOST OR WASTED</strong> each year, a recent General      Accounting Office study says. In 1974 alone-GAO      maintains-some 137 million tons of food valued at $31      billion were lost through waste, spoilage, etc. Of this      amount, 16%o was lost at harvest, 20% at the food      distributor, 7%0 during storage, 2% in processing, 1%      during transport . . . and 53% at the dinner table.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IF YOU LIKE OLD-TIMEY CLOTHING, YOU'LL LOVE      FOLKWEAR'S "PATTERNS FROM TIMES PAST".</strong> As with      their other garment patterns (there are several),      Folkwear's new Prairie Dress and Victorian      Shirt-$4.50 and $3.50 respectively-are works of      art that must be seen to be appreciated. (We can hardly      wait to see what the other designs in Folkwear's new      Patterns From Times Past series are going to look like!)      For more information, contact your fabric store or write:      Folkwear, Box 98, Dept. TMEN, Forestville, Calif. 95436.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL SUE      VELSICOL CHEMICAL CORPORATION</strong> and Farm Bureau      Services, Inc. for $119 million to cover costs incurred by      the state in destroying some 2,000,000 PBB-contaminated      farm animals over a five-year period. (In 1973, Velsicol      mistakenly shipped PBB's-polybrominated biphenyls, a      deadly fire-retardant chemical-to Farm Bureau      Services in place of a feed additive. Farm Bureau then sold      PBB-tainted feed to farmers.) Velsicol and Farm Bureau have      reportedly settled 700 PBB-related claims since 1973, at a      cost of nearly $40 million. More than 100 suits now await      trial.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AFRICA'S ELEPHANTS MAY BE EXTINCT WITHIN FIVE      YEARS.</strong> That's the latest word from Kenya-based      wildlife expert Dr. Ian Douglas-Hamilton, who points out      that the elephant population is declining rapidly in all      but four African countries (Somalia, Rwanda, Botswana, and      South Africa). The reason for the decline: Overhunting      spurred by the worldwide demand for ivory. Douglas-Hamilton      estimates that in 1976, an amount of ivory equivalent to      between 100,000 and 400,000 elephants left the Dark      Continent. Only about 1.3 million elephants remain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A LIMIT TO MOTORCYCLE NOISE?</strong> The U.S.      Environmental Protection Agency has proposed motorcycle      noise standards that would mandate a five-decibel reduction      in street-bike engine noise by 1985. (Dirt bikes would be      required to achieve a two- to nine-decibel sound reduction      over the same period.) With the exception of      mopeds-which are already quiet enough to meet the      proposed standards-only 5% of motorcycles now being      made live up to the EPA's 1985 noise specifications.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WINERIES, BREWERIES, AND DAIRIES CAN ALL GO INTO      THE ATOMIC BOMB BUSINESS</strong> , an internal memo from      Oak Ridge National Laboratory asserts. Memo author D.E.      Ferguson claims that any country wanting to produce its own      weapons-grade plutonium car! do so within six months' time      by converting existing facilities (namely, wineries and/or      breweries and/or dairies) into "quick and dirty"      reprocessing plants. The U.S. General Accounting Office      says it is studying the memo.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SMUGGLERS, PLANES OFTEN END UP "BUSTED"</strong> .      Planes loaded with as much as $100,000 in illicit drugs are      crashing between the U. S. and South America at the rate of      eight a month, according to Justice Department figures      cited in the January 15, 1978 Aviation Consumer ($28/yr. or      $3.00/copy from Box 972, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11737). In one      recent two-year period, some 203 plane crashes involving 76      fatalities (and the seizure of more than 30 tons of drugs,      mostly marijuana) were tallied.    </p>    <p>      <strong>20TH CENTURY-FOX WILL REINTRODUCE "STAR WARS" THIS      SUMMER</strong> , with the aid of a massive TV ad campaign.      Look for the prime-time blitz to begin July 19 . . . .      Despite an average price near year's end of $57,700, the      Commerce Department says that no less than <strong>820,000      NEW SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES WERE SOLD IN THE U.S. IN      1977</strong> , the most sold in any year since 1963, the      first year that such records were kept . . . . Allied Water      Corporation of San Francisco claims it has developed      <strong>THE FIRST TRULY PORTABLE SEAWATER DESALTING      APPARATUS</strong> . The 85-pound, $4,700 machine is      powered by electricity and produces 200 gallons of fresh      water a day from ocean brine . . . . "We like the      airplane," Major Gen. Charles F. Kuyk Jr. says of the      mammoth Lockheed C-5, but "having the wings fall off at      8,000 hours is a problem." Thus, the Air Force will spend      <strong>1.3 BILLION TO PUT NEW WINGS ON ALL 77 EXISTING C-5      CARGO PLANES</strong> . . . . The U.S. Department of      Agriculture predicts that in 1978 there will be      <strong>ONLY 2.68 MILLION FARMS LEFT IN AMERICA</strong> ,      the smallest number since about 1870 . . . .      <strong>LOUISIANA RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN WARNED NOT TO EAT      ARMADILLOS</strong> , since some 50 armadillos with leprosy      have been found in the state during the past two years . .      . . <strong>WESTERN EATING HABITS ARE CAUSING MORE HEART      DISEASE IN JAPAN</strong> , according to Dr. Haruo Nakamura      of Jikei Medical University, who points out that since the      days of the American occupation, the number of Japanese      dying from heart-related problems has quadrupled . . . .      <strong>URBAN FOOD PRODUCTION, PEST CONTROL, GRAY WATER      USE, WIND POWER, AND DRY TOILETS</strong> are just a few of      the many topics discussed in the Farallones Institute's      latest Annual Report, available for $2.00 from 15290      Coleman Valley Rd., Occidental, Calif. 95465.
