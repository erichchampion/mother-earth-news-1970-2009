                    <p>      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Inc., P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28739    </p>		<hr />    <p>      In Issue No. 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of mankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "1'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied . . . and announced      our still-standing offer. Anyone (and that means you!) who      sends us a short (200 words or less) account of an actual      barter that's good enough to print will receive-as      the folks on the following pages have-a twelvemonth      subscription (or extension of same) to THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS (restricted) .    </p>    <p>      Living in the Bahamas-where it's generally illegal      for a foreigner to work for money-poses an      interesting challenge to an experienced barterer like      myself. Consequently I find myself really on the move . . .      trading fish for bananas and papaya . . . or giving a day's      work picking pineapples in exchange for a 50-pound sack of      the "pines". I've even swapped alfalfa sprouts (a treat no      Bahamian had ever heard of) for mangoes, which-in      turn-were bartered for a hot bath.    </p>    <p>      And there's this wonderful old farmer on the island who has      lost most of his eyesight. We often take walks together      through the thick bush on his land. Along the way he'll      stop and say, "Look in that tree, spy limes?" Sure enough.      The vegetation was so dense that I would have missed 'em,      but the old man knew where the limes were just by feel. And      he always insisted on giving me some of the fruit for      "being his eyes".    </p>    <p>      Now we're in the U.S. for a short time and I don't go      anywhere without a box of barter, usually some apples or      prunes. I trade for just about anything . . . from a meal      to a chiropractic adjustment. We experience more of a      feeling of giving what we have and receiving what we need.      And isn't that what it's really all about?    </p>    <p>      Jonah Richards<br />      Eleuthera, Bahamas    </p>    <p>      Last spring-naturally right about the time I needed      to plow, disc, and harrow-my tractor decided it      wouldn't start. So a friend who lives across the lake from      me (and who just happens to be an excellent, A-1 mechanic)      completely rebuilt the machine in trade for some milk,      eggs, and a kid goat. Not a bad deal for either of us!    </p>    <p>      Since that time I've traded milk to a next door neighbor      for a few truckloads of manure . . . swapped a rooster to      the local newspaper editor for a free ad . . . given some      garden space to another neighbor (we've got lots of 'em,      and all good folks) in return for weeding our garden . . .      well, I could go on and on. To my way of thinking, though,      makin' deals and trading is simply a transition between two      totally different ways of life.    </p>    <p>      Let me explain: In the anything-but-extinct monied,      capitalistic way of life the object of the game is to see      just how much you can get for yourself. The emphasis is on      the getting.    </p>    <p>      The other way is simply living by "giving". But it's an      awfully hard transition to make, moving that emphasis on      "getting" over to "giving". The true giving people offer      their time and energy without actually caring if it's      repaid . . . because they're aware of a cosmic harmony that      tends to balance out everything that really matters. In      that sense I guess it's a kind of cosmic trading . . . with      no need to waste time keeping score all the time.    </p>    <p>      But trading, swapping, bartering, whatever you call it . .      . it's great. It's not all giving and it's not all getting.      Just yesterday, In fact, a friend sent me a letter, saying      that some other friends up the coast would sure like to      trade mushrooms for a few pears and apples. Sounds OK to      me!    </p>    <p>      M.T. Coleman<br />      Ganges, B.C.<br />      Canada    </p>    <p>      Our family-style barters have gone on for so many years      that it's <em>impossible</em> to keep track of them all!      But here's a sampling:    </p>    <p>      I own a greenhouse, but have very little cleared land where      I can set out the vegetable seedlings I raise. My dad, on      the other hand, has lots of garden space . . . so I start      his seeds in my greenhouse and pass along the strong,      healthy young plants for him to put in his plot (which has      already been tilled-and will later be weeded-by      my sister and brother-in-law). Then, at harvest time      (which, I might add, is often weeks before other gardeners'      crops are usually ready), my father provides my sister, her      husband, and me with all the fresh beans, corn, squash, and      other vegetables we need.    </p>    <p>      More swaps: On frequent visits, my sister-a budding      photographer-swaps lots of pictures of my new      daughter for use of my sewing machine. Then there's my      brother (a house painter) who enjoys a home-cooked      breakfast at my mom's house every day and-in      return-has paneled her kitchen, put in a new dining      room ceiling, and painted her entire house.    </p>    <p>      My sister-in-law gets into the act by driving my mother on      shopping trips so that she can use Mom's car. And I take my      sister-in-law swimming once a week during the summer in      exchange for a little babysitting time.    </p>    <p>      In other words, whenever someone in our family finds an      item that's no longer needed (alarm clocks, tablecloths,      clothing, food, vitamins, plants . . . you name it), he/she      checks with the other households for a possible swap.      Anything left over goes into a big box in my basement      and-in the spring and fall-we get together for      a great family fun day: selling our combined treasures at      an outdoor flea market. If <em>that</em> doesn't dispose of      a particular item . . . only then do we think about      throwing it away!    </p>    <p>      Elise MacDonald<br />      Yorktown Heights, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      My husband Clif and I often spend afternoons searching for      arrowheads and other Indian artifacts. Of course I show our      finds to <em>everyone</em> . . . including our dentist      (who's also interested in these historical objects but who      simply has no spare time to spend tramping through fields      searching for them).    </p>    <p>      So naturally we started to swap: our D.D.S.'s professional      services (a gold crown on one of my teeth, for example) in      exchange for our Indian treasures (in one particular      instance, a war club in such excellent shape that the deer      hide wrapped around the handle was still intact).    </p>    <p>      We've continued to trade off and on, and-as a      result-have both saved a lot of money in the process.      And Clif and I feel doubly lucky because we've got two      reasons to keep smiling: Not only do we get competent      dental care, but-at the same time we're "working"      gathering the artifacts-we can spend some truly      pleasant hours together outdoors.    </p>    <p>      Debby Major<br />      Wichita, Kan.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER NO. 49 arrived in the mail at a time when I badly      needed some winter boots but just didn't have the money to      purchase the really warm pair I'd set my mind on. Your      Successful Swaps feature, however, set my wheels in motion.    </p>    <p>      Since my chickens were laying well, I stayed awake all one      night mentally asking the owners of the only nearby store      which carried such boots if they'd trade for several dozens      of my eggs over the coming months. The next morning when I      told my husband about the scheme, he was skeptical . . .      but I remained determined. "Look," I said, "I'm going out      to ask the store owners if they'd care to barter . . . and      then I'm going to come home and write MOTHER to tell her      about my deal so I can receive a 12-month renewal of my      subscription!"    </p>    <p>      To make the story short, that's exactly what I did (though      1 have to confess I was sure afraid to try this unusual      business arrangement for the first time). And now I have a      pair of warm boots, some new egg customers, another year of      MOTHER . . . <em>and</em> the confidence to suggest even      more swaps in the future.    </p>    <p>      Thanks for the inspiration!    </p>    <p>      Diane Kaufmann<br />      Hot Sulphur Springs, Colo.    </p>    <p>      During the winter, we've always been able to see for 30      miles out the back windows of our hilltop house . . . but      in past summers, leaves on the tall trees growing behind      our home would block this scenic vista. For some reason, we      never mustered enough time-or energy-to remove      all those trees ourselves. So I finally decided to run an      ad in our local paper offering free wood (mostly oak and      maple . . . both excellent fuels) to anyone who'd cut and      haul the timber away.<br />    </p>    <p>      The seven groups which accepted my offer eventually took      down 50 or 60 trees (I had all the folks sign a disclaimer      to free us of responsibility in case anyone got hurt). One      couple-who felled and carted off five utility      trailers' worth of freshly cut firewood-then returned      to give us a load of already split and seasoned logs from      their own supply. And of course we gathered up plenty of      small leftover scraps to keep our fireplace ablaze      throughout the cold season.    </p>    <p>      Now we've reclaimed our view (at considerable savings to us      . . . a professional tree removal company once charged us      $200 for cutting down a single tree). And a number of      hardworking woodcutters have been able to enjoy the      comfort-and economy-of <em>free</em> wood heat.    </p>    <p>      Gail Olson<br />      Harvard, Mass.    </p>    <p>      After "serving time" in the city, our decision to move to      the country came as naturally as breathing. And-just      as naturally-barter became part of our lives from the      very start: We (my husband and I) acquired a lovely old      farmhouse for a pittance in rent . . . simply because we      agreed to take care of repairs and up-keep.    </p>    <p>      It wasn't long before we discovered that our artistic      talents were especially valuable "trade goods". For      instance: In exchange for designing some business cards and      flyers three years ago, I received a beautiful registered      appaloosa filly (which is now worth far more than my      original artwork). More recently, we swapped custom design      work on a van interior for a much needed four-wheel-drive      vehicle.    </p>    <p>      Almost everyone requires a sign at some time or another,      and we've taken full advantage of that fact by trading for      hospital care, a lawyer's services in drafting a will,      electrical work, some long-desired (and-before      barter-some long-out-of-financial-reach) flying      lessons, veterinary services, and even the retirement of a      small bank loan.    </p>    <p>      It's really great! No one has felt cheated . . . and we've      gotten to know some wonderful neighbors.    </p>    <p>      Pamela Cox<br />      Bedford, Va.    </p>    <p>      A while back, a woman in my community needed the remains of      her mobile home-which had been destroyed in a      fire-removed from her lot (for the least expense      possible, of course). Though the structure had burned clean      to the floor, 1 discovered that the axles and tires were      barely scorched.    </p>    <p>      So . . . I hitched my trusty 1962 Chevy pickup to the      carcass and pulled it the short half mile from her property      to the local landfill. There I cut the frame just behind      the axles and removed (and discarded) the ruined      appliances, furniture, and flooring. Then I towed the      stripped-down skeleton home, moved the axles forward,      installed an oak deck (made from 2 X 6 boards) . . . and      sat back to admire my durable, first-rate"hauler".    </p>    <p>      This new trailer opened the door to yet a second swap. One      of my neighbors needed some trees removed from his garden      area. Together we cut the timber and-with my      vehicle-carted it to the mill where we swapped the      logs for 2 X 4's. My friend ended up with enough lumber to      build a chicken shed (in addition to getting a cleared      garden and a number of treetops for firewood). In return,      he helped me thin my woodlot and haul away the logs.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, I'm always looking for a swap . . . even a      "one-way" deal where I do a service and tell the recipient      "I'll let you know when I need some help". There's just no      better way to make-or strengthen-a friendship.    </p>    <p>      Dan Crutchfield<br />      Folsom, La.    </p>    <p>      I'm a professional photographer who teaches the standard      basics of photography . . . but I get a special kick out of      giving my students hints for minimizing dependency on      store-bought supplies and equipment.    </p>    <p>      In this spirit (doing an "end run" around The System, that      is), I encourage the members of my classes to barter out      the cost of my course of instructions instead of paying me      money for it. These swaps not only prove both interesting      and useful, but provide continuing relationships with class      members.    </p>    <p>      For example: A recent three-night, six-hour, intensive      training session for six "would-be" photographers yielded a      much-needed cookstove, two excellent haircuts, a dental      checkup (complete with teeth cleaning and X-rays), a      three-day trailer rental, someone to assist me in loading a      huge moving van, and some fine wine.    </p>    <p>      I'd <em>never</em> trade these swaps for cash!    </p>    <p>      Bob Fitch<br />      Weed, Calif.    </p>    <p>      When we purchased our new home, we faced two immediate      problems: depletion of our savings and the need for a      storage area (to protect bicycles, garden equipment, etc.).      We had our hearts set on a 10-foot-square metal shed, but      its retail price ($150) was out of our reach.    </p>    <p>      One day I noticed that a nearby house-which had      recently burned-had the kind of shed I needed around      back. After checking out the situation, I discovered that      the real estate company which had handled our home also      owned the burned-out property. So I called our agent      and-after explaining our economic      situation-asked him to hold the orphan outbuilding      for several months till we could afford it.    </p>    <p>      Luck, however, was with us that day. The fellow on the      phone remembered seeing some of my handmade furniture and      asked if 1 could do simple carpentry work. Without      hesitation I answered yes . . . figuring I could always      <em>learn</em> if I didn't already know how to do whatever      task he needed done. As it turned out, the agent had      several jobs which regular contractors considered too small      . . . and told me that if I could handle the work, the shed      and its contents were mine.    </p>    <p>      Two days later-after sanding and painting some doors      and replacing a porch-my wife and I dismantled our      new prize and hauled it to our yard.    </p>    <p>      But the best surprise was yet to come! In addition to the      shed and its brick flooring, we also got a metal cabinet,      six 2" X 8" X 8" boards, a firewood storage rack, and      several gallons of paint. And to top off the whole deal,      the real estate agent liked my work so much that he now      <em>pays</em> me for similar small jobs.    </p>    <p>      Swapping my time and effort not only got me the shed, but      also opened the door to a well-paying, part-time business.      Now my bikes stay dry . . . and thanks to the extra cash      I'm earning, our savings are growing.    </p>    <p>      Sid Hepler<br />      Goose Greek, S.C.    </p>    <p>      During my 10 years as a mechanic, I've encountered many      customers-particularly students-who needed my      services but just couldn't afford to pay for them. The      answer to this dilemma (barter, of course!) was revealed to      me one day when a fine arts student from a nearby      university offered to trade some of her ceramics for a      major engine job. As a result of that agreement, I became      the happy owner of a beautiful set of custom-made plates      and bowls . . . and also found a new friend (Pookie, the      pottery student) that 1 would have missed if the      transaction had been made in cash.    </p>    <p>      I liked the idea-and the results-of that swap      so well that I've since exchanged my labor for a. host of      items . . . everything from a color TV for an engine      overhaul to beer and sandwiches for a minor service call.    </p>    <p>      It's fun to replace the callousness of "plastic money" with      the personal touch inherent in the barter system. And that      one-to-one approach is a refreshing antidote for the "cold,      hard cash syndrome" that's infected today's society.    </p>    <p>      Rick Williams<br />      Plantsville, Conn.    </p>    <p>      When the wife and I purchased our 90-year-old wood range      (to be used for both cooking and heating), we      realized-sadly-that our old potbelly stove just      had to go. The question was: where?    </p>    <p>      Later that week, while browsing through an antiques shop,      we spied a vintage 1914 kerosene water heater (with lots of      brass!) that still worked. Though the chances were slim      (after all, the price on the water heater was five times      more than what I'd paid for our stove), I finally gathered      up enough courage to ask the store owner if he'd be      interested in trading straight across for our      no-longer-needed potbelly. Much to my surprise, he agreed.    </p>    <p>      Now, with our wood range and kerosene water heater, we're      further on the way to becoming comfortably self-sufficient.      And the two items together add that perfect old-timey touch      to our kitchen.    </p>    <p>      Jeff Lee<br />      Porterville, Calif.    </p>
