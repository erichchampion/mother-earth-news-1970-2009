                    <p>      From <em>Sparetime Dollars From the Kitchen: How to Start      and Run a Successful Home Kitchen      Business-Inexpensively, Legally, and Profitably</em>      by One Evers, copyright 1978 by the author. Reprinted by      permission. The book is a large paperback, available for      $5.99 (price includes postage and handling) from Onaway      Publications, 28 Lucky Drive, San Rafael, California 94904.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>"Hundreds and hundreds of women are having the fun of      running their own sparetime kitchen businesses and making a      good profit from it. You can do it too!"</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It's this kind of infectious enthusiasm that permeates      One Evers's new book,</em> Sparetime Dollars From the      Kitchen <em>(from which the following selections have been      excerpted). If you've long thought about using your      culinary skills to generate additional income for yourself      and your family-but have yet to act on the      idea-maybe One's voice of experience will be just the      encouragement you need to go ahead and make some      money!</em>    </p>    <h3>WHERE TO BEGIN</h3>    <p>      If you want to sell something, you naturally have to be      sure you have someone to sell it to. So your first step      will be to find out just what markets or outlets are      available. You won't be selling anything at this point,      because you haven't made your product yet.    </p>    <p>      What you <em>will</em> be doing is looking around and      "casing the joints". For instance, if you plan to make      jams, jellies, or relishes for sale, who is likely to buy      them? You want to have some firm ideas about this before      you invest in jars and ingredients and the rest. The same      goes for bakery goods or anything else.    </p>    <h3>WHERE TO LOOK FOR MARKETS</h3>    <p>      This will depend on your product. If it's to be jams,      relishes, preserves, and that sort of food, look in gourmet      shops first to see if they carry anything like your      products. (It they don't, it doesn't mean that they won't      want yours. They may not have thought of local suppliers      like you.) Try small grocery stores, gift shops, import      stores (these often carry domestic products too),      delicatessens, and specialty food shops like cheese stores.      If your product uses only natural ingredients, health food      stores are a good bet.    </p>    <p>      You probably already know of many such stores in your area.      For others, make a list from the Yellow Pages of your phone      book.    </p>    <p>      Then look into the various kinds of fairs, flea markets,      and club and church sales in your area. Laundromats,      groceries, and many other such businesses are good places      to put up notices or handmade posters if you want to sell      to individual customers.    </p>   <h3>FINDING YOUR FIRST MARKET</h3>    <p>      Quite likely you're already acquainted with a store owner      in your area. This is great. The best thing you can do is      <em>start with one good market.</em> Some people never need      more than that: one good outlet that's steady and      dependable. If you know of such a store, and know the owner      well enough, you might tell him of your project and see      what he thinks of it.    </p>    <p>      Personally, though, I've found that it's better to wait      until you have a sample of the product in hand, and can      give the proprietor a taste of your marvelous wild      blackberry jam, or whatever. But look his store over      carefully first as a possible starting place.    </p>    <h3>PERISHABLES ARE DIFFERENT</h3>    <p>      Bakery goods-cakes, pies, breads, cookies, and the      like-are handled differently from the processed foods      like jams and relishes, because they <em>must</em> be      fresh. That's one of your biggest selling points. Even if      you have a freezer so that you can bake ahead, that good      old fresh-out-of-the-oven smell, feel, and taste is one of      the things that puts you out ahead of the mass-market      product. (That, and the good quality of your ingredients.)    </p>    <p>      Here, too, I suggest you look over the possible markets      before you start: locally owned restaurants, coffee shops,      delicatessens, groceries, specialty food shops, health food      stores (especially for good natural-ingredients breads).      With outlets of this type, you'll probably be baking weekly      for a set market.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, through word-of-mouth advertising, many      women have set up profitable kitchen businesses by just      baking individual orders of specialty cakes and pies. You      can start by lining up some customers who've shown interest      in your baked goods at church or club sales.    </p>   <h3>HOW TO JUDGE A MARKET</h3>    <p>      By being critical, that's how. There are several advantages      to the critical approach. The main one is that it puts you      in the driver's seat. You're not trying to <em>sell</em>      anything, so you have no reason to feel nervous or uptight.      You're just checking out the store. You're in charge. In      fact, some places won't pass your inspection.    </p>    <p>      Here's how to do it: When you go into a store, look it over      carefully, and ask yourself, "Do I want my product sold      here?"    </p>    <p>      Is it <em>cheerful, clean, and well-lighted?</em> Or is it      musty and understocked . . . the kind of place that looks      as if it never pays its bills, so that you'd be kind of      ashamed to display your delicious chutney there. Is it      busy? How do the clerks and manager talk to the customers?      Are they friendly?    </p>    <p>      You don't want to waste your goodies on a dud of a place.      You want them where they'll be cherished, pointed out to      customers by helpful clerks. You want the kind of place      that handles enough business to give you lots of re-orders.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes people just starting out in small businesses      (home businesses, especially) are so anxious to place their      product with a store-and so lacking in confidence in      the product or themselves-that they eagerly leave      their jam or whatever in stores that are never going to      have enough business to sell the jam, or anything else      much. Or the store owner is the kind that just plops it on      a shelf and forgets it, and lets it gather dust. <em>Such a      place is not for you.</em>    </p>   <h3> FIND OUT ABOUT THE FOOD PREPARATION LAWS IN YOUR      AREA</h3>    <p>      <em>Finding out</em> about the laws or rules is very      simple. Fulfilling them is more difficult-but not      impossible-if you live in a state with strict food      preparation laws. Remember: <em>There is always a way.</em>    </p>    <p>      The simplest way to find out about applicable rules and      regulations is to phone or write your county health      department and ask to know the requirements for the      preparation of food to be sold. If there are such laws in      your state, <em>don't try to sneak past them.</em> You      could find yourself faced with a stiff fine! The health      department will probably send you a pamphlet called      something like "Retail Food Production and Marketing      Establishments Law".    </p>    <p>      Although you will most likely be selling "wholesale"      (selling to a store which will then sell your products      retail . . . that is, to the ultimate consumer, his      customers), these laws still apply to you. So don't ignore      them and hope no one will notice. The health officers are      the watch dogs of the public's health, and always seem to      find out.    </p>    <p>      California has the strictest set of regulations I've come      across. Probably your own state doesn't quite have such      tough laws. But find out!    </p>    <h3>IS A KITCHEN BUSINESS FOR YOU?</h3>    <p>      Whatever area you live in, the questions you must ask      yourself are:    </p>    <p>      <em>Can I fulfill my promises?</em> When I find a market,      can I be sure I can deliver on time and in the ordered      quantities? Actually, you can do it easily, because your      first orders won't be very big. By the time you've lived up      to your promises on these, you'll have the hang of it.    </p>    <p>      <em>Can I raise the cash to get started?</em> It won't take      much cash expenditure for your first small orders. Most of      us are able to manage the start by using supplies we      already have: some jars, maybe berries from a friend's      garden, flour for baking, etc. It's okay to use these the      first time around. But, as soon as possible, separate your      business and your home expenses.    </p>    <p>      Why? One good reason is that you'll never know for sure if      you're making a profit if you don't. Another good reason is      that you can take your kitchen business expenditures off      your income tax as legitimate expenses.    </p>    <p>      Whatever means you use to start up your business, <em>don't      borrow money</em> . A debt hanging over your head just as      you're getting started makes you feel as if you're always      running behind and will never catch up. It takes all the      fun out of having your own sparetime kitchen business.    </p>    <p>      One way that many women have cut down on expenses is      through barter . . . and that's fun too! Some have swapped      their preserves for fresh fruits, or traded luscious bakery      goods in return for eggs and milk. Think of activities like      this <em>before</em> you think of borrowing money.    </p>    <p>      There are bound to be certain things you'll have to buy.      For bakery goods, for instance, you'll probably need some      of those flimsy boxes that are used for cakes, pies, and      cookies. You'll want some labels made up for your jars (if      your product comes in jars) and you'll need jars and lids,      of course, and-for breads-plastic wrap.    </p>    <p>      Keep track of every expense . . . even the gas you use to      deliver your goodies. If your initial business cash is      coming from the household money (and it usually does), keep      track and repay it from business profits as soon as      possible.    </p>   <h3>HOW MUCH PROFIT SHOULD YOU MAKE?</h3>    <p>      You should make a profit of 40% over your expenses, at      least. For every dollar you spend (that's counting      <em>everything</em> . . . even a quarter teaspoon of      cinnamon), you should make 40  cents, and probably more.    </p>    <p>      For fancy cakes and pies, closer to 80% is more in line.      But for jams, relishes, and that sort of product, 40% or      slightly over is good. Of course, you would be selling far      more jars of preserved foods than you would fancy cakes, so      the final profit evens out. You can only make so many fancy      cakes or pies without lowering quality (if you have to do      all the work yourself), but you can put up hundreds of jars      of jam . . . all of the same goodness.    </p>    <h3>HOW MUCH CAN YOU EARN?</h3>    <p>      There's no way to guarantee any certain amount. How much      you can earn depends on so many different things. For      instance:    </p>    <p>      •How much do you want to earn? How big do you want your      business to be? How much time do you have? You may be quite      content to keep the business small. Many of us are. A nice      steady little business can be a joy without taking too much      time or energy from our other interests and duties. If      you're more ambitious, that's fine too. It's up to you.<br />      •What about prices in your area? There is an amazing      difference in the prices for foods in different parts of      the country, and this will make a difference in what you      charge for your products.<br /> •What will your expenses be? Some      foods cost more to make, and the equipment will be      different for each type of product. You may have a fruit      orchard of your own, or have to buy your fruits. You may      have to drive a distance to deliver your products, or just      go down the street. No two of us have the same kinds of      expenses.<br /> •Your available markets may be many or few . . .      especially at first, until people learn about your      delicious products.    </p>    <p>      With a kitchen business, if you didn't sell one single jar      of jam or relish (which is practically impossible), you'd      never end up with <em>nothing</em> , because you'd still      have the food that your own family could use.    </p>    <p>      And you're too smart to invest in new equipment and large      amounts of ingredients-or to make up more than a few      samples of your product-until you have a market      FIRMLY lined up.    </p>    <p>      <em>So the risk in starting a</em> <em>kitchen business is      almost zero.</em> You have nothing to lose, and everything      to gain!    </p>    <p>      There have been women-we've all heard of      them-who built a little kitchen business into a      mufti-million-dollar business. And remember, they all      started out ladling jam or relishes into jars on the      kitchen table . . . just like you. Or baking their homemade      breads in a kitchen oven just as you breadmakers will be      doing.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO CHOOSE A PROFITABLE PRODUCT</h3>    <p>      Unless you already know just what your product will be,      you're probably juggling several ideas around. Here are      some suggestions to help you decide.    </p>    <p>      1. What do you want to <em>make</em> for selling? If you      hate putting up preserved foods-even though you have      a hunch they might sell well-don't put them up.      Instead, make that great fudge that every one likes so      much, or something else that you like to make. Selling your      product will depend a lot on your personal enthusiasm, and      it's hard to be enthusiastic about something that you don't      even like to make.    </p>    <p>      2. What can you <em>afford</em> to make and sell? Even if      your grapefruit chutney is beloved by all, if you have to      put out a lot of money for ingredients and then sell it at      a low price because of competition or some other reason,      you aren't going to make a decent profit.    </p>    <p>      3. Which brings up competition. Check this out when you're      going the rounds of possible markets. Perhaps some other      kitcheneer is already making the product you want to sell.      Even if you think yours is better, it's a good idea to make      something different.    </p>    <p>      It doesn't have to be <em>very</em> different. Often it      takes just a couple of different ingredients, or a catchy      kind of name . . . something that sets your product apart      from the others and gives it a personal touch.    </p>    <p>      4. Are there enough available markets for your proposed      product? If every woman in your community puts up her own      jams and jellies, then obviously there isn't going to be      much sale for yours. You'll do better with something that      they don't ordinarily make, but wish they could.    </p>    <p>      One woman I know of, in a fruit-growing community, not only      became well known but made herself buckets of dollars with      her fresh tamales, delivered weekly to local groceries.      Orders came in from all the towns around, and she had to      take on a partner to keep up with them all.    </p>    <p>      But it doesn't have to be anything as drastically different      as tamales! Perhaps an unusual combination of fruits, or      vegetable preserves, intriguingly different relishes,      chutneys, or pickles. Start with whatever markets you find,      and others will soon turn up.    </p>    <p>      5. Do you have the equipment or kitchen setup to make your      product in profitable quantity? You probably do. There's      hardly any kitchen product that takes much room to make. A      freezer is a big help, but many successful kitcheneers do      well without one, and preserved foods can be stored easily      in any cool, dark place until you take them to the stores.    </p>    <p>      6. Finally, be sure you can make your goods easily and      cheaply. If you have to go three towns away for some      expensive ingredients, or spend hours peeling or mincing      something, you'll soon get tired of the whole idea.      Remember, you won't be doing this just for a few Christmas      presents, or a one-time cake sale at the church. You'll be      making your product in fairly large quantities (or, in the      case of bakery goods, doing it often).    </p>    <h3>HOW TO KNOW IF YOU'RE REALLY MAKING A      PROFIT</h3>    <p>      Unless you want to find out one day that you're paying for      the privilege of making and selling your product-as I      unhappily did the first time around- <em>you must      keep records</em> . . . just simple records, but they must      be accurate and up-to-date. And the price of every jar lid      must be counted in. It's the only way you can figure out      how much to ask for your product so as to make a profit,      because those nickels and dimes add up surprisingly.    </p>    <p>      Keeping careful records will help you keep expenses down.      You'll soon see where certain things are costing more than      they need to, and you'll learn to cut corners. But      <em>never cut the quality of your product.</em> Quality is      your biggest selling point.    </p>    <p>      Careful records will show you where you have to change      products, or cut out unprofitable ones. And records of your      markets will show which are not worth the trouble of      supplying them and which pay highest profit over cost.    </p>    <p>      Don't forget about hidden costs-the ones we hardly      think of as expenses of our kitchen businesses-like      the gas it took to deliver your product, the electricity      you used to make it, the labels, the doilies under the      cakes, the parking meter while you ran into the store with      a box of your jams, the baby-sitter the day somebody had a      cold and you had to deliver eight cakes to Miller's Market.    </p>    <p>      These are all important expenses, and not just for knowing      if you're making a profit. Some are reportable legal      expenses. Take advantage of the tax breaks that are      possible when you're in business for yourself.    </p>   <h3>SHOULD YOU TAKE A PARTNER?</h3>    <p>      This depends on how much food you plan to sell, and on the      partner. A lazy or bossy type can soon take the joy out of      the adventure. If you saw-when you were looking over      possible markets-that there would be more business      than you could handle alone, or if your spare time is      limited so that you'll be hard put to fulfill orders, then      by all means take a partner. But choose one with the      greatest of care.    </p>    <p>      The division of labor and profits must be clearly      understood, and preferably in writing. Be sure to pick      someone whose ideas on personal responsibility match your      own.    </p>    <p>      There's one situation where I strongly recommend that you      take on, not partners exactly, but sharers. This is for      those of you who live in areas where the health laws are      very strict, so that you must set up a kitchen that can be      inspected and meet certain standards. For you people, the      sharing of expenses-that is, the initial expenses of      the kitchen-can sometimes make the difference between      being able to start a profitable business cheaply and not      being able to start at all.    </p>    <h3>WHAT ABOUT EMPLOYEES?</h3>    <p>      People are often tempted to hire someone to help out when      they've got a lot of orders, and things get ahead of them.      For the sparetime kitcheneer, this is just asking for      complications: insurance, social security, and all the rest      of it.    </p>    <p>      If you can't manage alone at some point, and don't want to      take on a full partner, go shares (an informal partnership      with the understanding that it's temporary). Or farm the      work out, with the firm understanding that the other worker      is self-employed and responsible to herself for reporting      her income, etc.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO SKIP THE MIDDLEMAN</h3>    <p>      Yes, you can skip the middleman-the      storekeeper-and make more profit per unit. (That is,      you get the whole amount the ultimate customer pays, not      just the percentage of it that you get when selling to      stores.)    </p>    <p>      Here's how other people do it:    </p>    <p>      1. Simple posters on store, laundromat, and other bulletin      boards, telling customers where they can order your      product. (If you don't want customers dropping by the      house, just give your phone number, but you'll have to      deliver in that case.)    </p>    <p>      2. Church, club, school, and other sales. These groups are      usually glad to have more goodies to sell and will sell      your products for a percentage of the profit, or let you      sell them yourself for a small fee.    </p>    <p>      3. County, state, and other fairs. Even large cities have      fairs of various sorts, and smaller cities have many of      them in summer and early fall. You may have to pay for a      booth, or for space to put up a card table, but lots of      people go in with a friend who's also selling things.    </p>    <p>      4. Flea markets. In this country there are many weekend      flea markets, which can be pleasant places to put your      products up for sale. Most will charge a small "space"      rental fee.    </p>    <p>      5. An ad in the classifieds of your local paper, giving      your phone number.    </p>    <p>      6. Word-of-mouth advertising. Tell your friends! Once you      have some pleased consumers praising your product, you'll      pick up other customers. (This is a slow way of getting      going, but moves well once underway.)    </p>    <p>      All of the above ideas will work especially well if you      emphasize the gift idea, or the holiday idea. There's      always a holiday of some kind-May Day, Apple Week,      etc.-to say nothing of the better known ones.    </p>    <h3>DO YOU NEED A SELLER'S PERMIT?</h3>    <p>      The seller's permit is not a business license, but has to      do with sales taxes, which vary widely from state to state      in just what is taxed and how the monies are paid. You may      not need one. Check with the nearest state board of      equalization to be sure. If your state collects sales      taxes, you'll probably need the permit number of the      markets you sell to. (This is to prove that you don't need      to pay a sales tax. Get us coming and going, don't they!)    </p>    <p>      The permit itself usually doesn't cost anything, but some      states require a "good faith" deposit that is returned to      you in a few years. (t almost wept when I discovered that      California regulations required me to put up a $100 "good      faith" deposit. But you get it back at the end of five      years, plus the regular compounded bank interest,      and-who knows?-I may be especially glad to get      that hundred-plus about that time.)    </p>    <p>      Now that I have my permit tacked up on the wall, it makes      me feel much more businesslike. Don't try to get away with      not getting one if it's required, 'cause they'll catch up      with you for sure.    </p>    <h3>WHAT ABOUT BUSINESS LICENSES?</h3>    <p>      There are states, counties, and cities that require a      license for any sort of business, no matter how small.      These vary even more than seller's permits and health      regulations. Check this out first with other people in      small home businesses. If you don't know a friendly      sparetime kitcheneer, then find a handicrafter . . .      someone who makes and sells quilts, picture frames, or      pottery, or teaches knitting.    </p>    <p>      The reason for checking with them first is that there are      so many confusing laws these days that even the people in      government offices aren't always sure what's what.      Sometimes they'll insist that you need licenses and permits      when you really don't. So check it with small business      people who are already making it before you let the red      tape tangle you up.    </p>    <p>      Also, if you're in a city, check zoning laws. It may be      easier to share a kitchen with a friend who lives outside a      zoned area.    </p>   <h3>SHOULD YOU LEAVE THINGS ON      CONSIGNMENT?</h3>    <p>      No, I don't advise it.    </p>    <p>      Here's what consignment is: You leave your product with the      store, but they don't <em>buy</em> it. You just leave it to      see if it will sell. The understanding is that if anything      does sell, the store will pay you when you next come in.    </p>    <p>      In other words, the store has your product and the money.      You have nothing.    </p>    <p>      Because the product isn't the storekeeper's, he has no real      motivation to sell it. Of course, if he <em>should</em>      sell it, he'll get the usual percentage. But consignment      products often end up out of sight in back corners.    </p>    <p>      Or (and I hate to say this, but there are dishonest      storekeepers) you might go in and find that three of the      six jars of relish you left are gone. When you try to      collect from the manager, you're told that the store didn't      sell them. "Shoplifters must've taken them." We-e-e-ll,      maybe they did. But-wherever the jars      are-you're not going to get paid for them, and you      have no way to prove anything. The store's not out      anything. The only person who's out is you.    </p>    <h3>GETTING PAID FOR YOUR PRODUCTS</h3>    <p>      Find out at what times the manager is in and make your      deliveries then, because you <em>must</em> be paid when you      deliver the products. Make that your firm company rule. In      some stores, a cashier or bookkeeper will do the paying.      Just make sure that someone authorized to give out the      money or check will be there.    </p>    <p>      When you deliver your products, have whoever accepts them      sign for them, right in your order book.    </p>    <p>      And don't give credit. The smaller companies, like ours,      are always the last to be paid. It takes time and paper      work-and makes for bad feelings-when you have      to be a collection agency on top of everything else. That's      not the business you're in. You're in the business of      manufacturing and selling food products.    </p>
