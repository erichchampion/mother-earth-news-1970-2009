<p>
<p>Water is mankind's most wasted commodity. The water needs of a primitive savage — for drinking, cooking and occasional washing-have been estimated to be 1 gallon per day; the average modern city dweller uses 1,200 gallons per day. This includes his share of industrial and agricultural usage in the country and over the world. It takes, for instance, 65,000 gallons of water to produce one ton of steel; 225 gallons to produce an egg; and 550 gallons to grow the grain and produce a loaf of bread.</p>

The Owner Built Home & Homestead
</a>
<br />

<p>
<p>As one advances from house planning to actual building, he soon discovers that the design of a house cannot be divorced from its structural purpose. The 18th century sculptor, Horatio Greenough, recommended that man-made designs, like those found in nature, should follow the function of the structure. This form follows function concept implies that the actual beauty of a building is relative to the degree to which it meets the demands of its function. A home with a high degree of living efficiency is almost always esthetically pleasing.</p>

<br />

<p>
The bug, (the old-time term for a sort of simplified lantern) is definitely a more-for-less item.

The bug is definitely a more-for-less item.

<p>
Wild white mustard, a dark green plant with tiny yellow blossoms running up the slender stem and the many-leaved plant with silvery shine to the foliage were gathered as greens for drying in the sun. And later after several days and numerous turnings, the leaves were as dry and crisp as potato chips. Then Mamma cooked them like any fresh greens and they were good.

Luckily for us, these mystery plants were wild bergamot (Monardo fistulosa), and they turned out to be our biggest bonus crop of all!</p>
