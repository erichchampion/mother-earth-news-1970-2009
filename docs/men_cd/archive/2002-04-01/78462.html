                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>            <p>      In the late summer, when the grapes are getting about as      sweet as they can get, robins, finches, king birds and      other fruitlovers become quite attracted to my arbors. I      have found recycled compact discs can keep the birds at      bay, at least during midday when they seem the most      aggressive. The shiny, mirrorlike surfaces of CDs are      highly reflective and create a bright, swirling rainbow of      color. If you hang several discs around a tree or      grapevine, the blinding reflection is too intense for those      beady bird eyes, and the opportunistic omnivores seek      easier peckings elsewhere. The trick to hanging the CDs for      maximum bird-repelling effect is to bend a 3-inch--LONG for      piece of wire into the shape of the Greek letter omega Make      the loop part      about 1/2 inch wide so it slips through the hole in the      center of the disc. The "feet" of the omega catch the edge      of the hole so the wire hanger doesn't slip through      entirely. Tie a length of fishing line to the center of the      omega's loop and the other end to a s upporting branch. If      done properly the disc should have the shiny side facing      skyward, but should not be balanced perfectly horizontal.      Instead let the disc tilt at a 30 to 45 degree angle. The      discs should be able to rotate freely and placed where they      can catch the sun's rays. <em>PAUL NEHER</em> <em>Las      Cruces, New Mexico</em>    </p>    <h3>      Rude Callers?
