        <p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p><p>One issue I have yet to see addressed in an energy conservation article concerns the air supply used for common household clothes dryers. I have reduced our utility bill by constructing a simple duct that runs from the air intake on the rear of the dryer to a high point inside the attic near the ridge, where the hottest air is on sunny days. This attic-intake system saves in two important ways: First, no conditioned air is taken out of the house; and second, the hot air used from the attic reduces the amount of electricity the dryer requires to create heat. The duct system consists of a 6-inch diameter sheet metal pipe fitted into a fiberglass insulation sleeve made for round ducts. I hope this information will be useful to others looking to reduce utility costs.<br /><br />Gary Dethloff<br />Jacksonville, Florida</p>
