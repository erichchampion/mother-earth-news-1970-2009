                <p>      <strong>HOMESTEADING</strong>    </p>            <p>      You don't need a ranch to raise your own, healthy, pastured      beef. Just a little patch of grass and some fencing will do      the trick just fine.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>In the tiny village of Vanlue, Ohio, Pat and      Sheila Kinley operate Sunny Side Meats, a sort of      mom-and-pop butchering business that serves small-scale      farmers, gardeners and homesteaders who raise a calf, lamb      or pig for their own meat. Although there's not much public      hoopla about this kind of meat production, the number of      people involved is surprisingly large and growing. Sunny      Side is overwhelmed with work.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      "We have to turn people away," says Pat, as if he barely      believes it himself. Sunny Side, like thousands of similar      shops, is regularly inspected and is as clean as any      commercial meat processing plant. But its meat can't be      sold commercially. Each package of meat must be stamped a      "not for sale," a mysterious turn of the bureaucratic mind,      which seems explainable only as a form of protection for      big meat packers who don't like people providing for      themselves.    </p>    <p>      Sunny Side butchers for people who raise their own meat,      mostly pasture enthusiasts who avoid antibiotics and      hormones. I understand the attraction. As a producer of      homegrown meat raised on pasture grasses, I believe mine is      healthier than the commercial stuff-and I know it      tastes better. As Brad Billock, whose trailer I use to haul      my beef to Sunny Side and who raises two steers every year      says: "When we first raised our own meat, I could hardly      believe how much better it tasted compared to what we were      buying in the grocery stores."    </p>    <p>      And all you really need is a little grass.    </p>    <h3>      GOOD STARTS    </h3>        <p>      On our 20-acre farm our focus is on the rotational grazing      method, which is gaining interest now because of its cost,      health and environmental benefits. (See "Pasture Perfect,"      Page 46.) We wanted to raise our beef like we raise our      lambs, entirely on pasture and mother's milk, producing      what is called baby beef. Our calves are born in the spring      and weigh about 650 pounds when we butcher them in late      fall. Not having to keep them over winter is a savings,      although somewhat canceled out because we do have to      maintain the mother cow over winter. But all our feed is      homegrown.    </p>    <p>      Our operation starts with a beef cow or beef-dairy cross.      We used to breed our cows artificially, but in recent years      we have just turned them in with our neighbor's bull (with      the neighbor's permission, of course). In our experience      calves raised on pasture, nursing their mothers and never      weaned, require no antibiotics, since they never get scours      or any other disease connected with early weaning stress.      We never administer hormones, since we are not interested      in speed-fattening the calf for profit. We try to breed our      cow so the calf comes when spring pasture season is getting      underway, so the cow has plenty of good forage to make      ample milk for the calf.    </p>    <p>      The secret of raising delectable beef on      grass-avoiding the expense and tallowy taste of      commercially fed beef-is to maintain lush pasture      through the growing season. For raising backyard beef, a      simplified version of the grass-fed method can suffice. If      your soil is fairly rich and rainfall exceeds 35 inches per      year, you need about an acre per calf or at least two acres      for a cow and calf. (Two is better for one, also, if your      goal is to avoid supplemental hay or grain.) In a drier      climate, you'd need to at least double these acreage      requirements. Many homesteads have an acre or more that's      wasted as lawn. According to research at Stockholm      University in Sweden, the air pollution from cutting grass      with a gasoline-powered lawn mower for an hour is the same      as driving a car for 93 tees. Americans use 800 million      gallons of gas per year to mow their lawns. Why not produce      delicious, healthful meat and spend less time mowing?    </p>    <h3>      FENCING    </h3>    <p>      Backyard beef begins with a solid fence around the pasture.      Building a durable cattle fence costs about 35  cents per      foot minimum, expensive for fencing large fields but not so      much for a couple of acres. Built well, it will last 30      years. I strongly advise a woven-wire cattle fence 47      inches high, with the top and bottom strands made of      9-gauge wire and the others at least 11 gauge. Thinner wire      isn't strong enough and won't last long enough. You also      can use five strands of barbed wire or a five-strand New      Zealand fence with two strands electrified. But a good      woven-wire fence will repay the work put into it many times      over, specially if you have close neighbors. It keeps ot      large dogs and small children.    </p>    <p>      If you don't know how to build a fence, talk to someone who      does. A fragile electric fence is no good to maintain      property lines. Invariably (like while you are away), your      animals will either stumble the electric wire or it will      short out and your calves will escape. I once had 20 calves      break out and race through our village, my own version of      the Running of the Bulls.    </p>    <p>      You shouldn't have to mow a paddock more than trice a year,      and sometimes not at all.    </p>    <h3>      PADDOCKS AND PASTURE    </h3>    <p>      In rotational grazing the pasture is divided into paddocks      and the livestock moved from paddock to paddock. By the      time the animals have grazed through the last one, the      first is ready to be grazed again. Electric fencing that is      easily movable is usually used to divide a pasture,    </p>    <p>      although you can build permanent fences after you learn the      best way to divide your pasture in your climate. I'd      suggest dividing a two-acre pasture into four paddocks of      1/2 acre each. As you see how your pasture grasses and      clovers grow, or realize other possibilities, you may want      to increase or decrease the number of paddocks. The more      paddocks, the more often you can move your beef to fresh      pasture. When grass is growing fast in spring and early      summer, you don't have to move as often. In June you may      want to do what professional graziers do: Make hay from the      grass and clover surplus in one or more of the paddocks and      stack it for supplemental feed for drought or winter. You      could use your lawn mower to cut small amounts of hay, but      a sickle bar mower is better because you can allow the      pasture to grow taller before harvesting. Many garden      tillers have sickle bar mower attachments available. If you      don't want hay, just mow the early summer surplus grass and      let it decay into the soil for more fertility.    </p>    <h3>      MOVING, MOVING, MOVING    </h3>    <p>      Pen your cow and calf in a paddock until they've eaten the      grass down, then turn them into the next paddock. The      proper amount of time varies with rainfall and land      fertility, but you'll learn. For one thing, your animals      will start complaining when they notice the grass is      greener across the fence. You want the animals to eat most      of the weeds and less desirable grass before you move them.      The few weeds they don't like, like bull thistles, you can      mow or hoe after you move the animals to the next paddock.      You shouldn't have to mow a paddock more than once or twice      a year, and sometimes not at all.    </p>    <p>      Since the animals will spend a week or more in each      paddock, you have to provide a-ater to each area. Often a      water trough can be placed where the corners of several      paddocks come together to serve them all. If you have two      acres divided into four paddocks, you can place one waterer      in the middle of the pasture where all four paddocks      converge.    </p>    <p>      Plant each paddock with different grasses and clovers to      ensure good pasture through the whole growing season.      Bluegrass and white clover make a good combination for      spring and fall, but an improved rye grass and Alice big      leaf clover combination is better. Timothy and red clover      make a good combination for summer and early winter in our      climate.    </p>    <p>      You might find alfalfa and ryegrass or alfalfa and brome      excellent for a drier climate and well-drained soil. There      are many other forages you can try, especially in the      South. Some graziers are planting paddocks with kale or      turnips for winter forage in the North. Combining a grass      with a legume is always a good idea, since the legume,      especially red clover and alfalfa, will continue to grow      lushly when dry weather turns grasses brown. Legumes also      provide nitrogen to the soil. Along with the animals'      manure, no other fertilizer should be necessary.    </p>    <p>      To prevent bloat, take care to introduce livestock slowly      to a lush stand of clover and then only when the animals      have eaten fully of other grass or hay. Bloat seldom occurs      on a mixed grass and clover pasture.    </p>    <p>      Seeding the paddocks can be done by broadcasting in winter      or early spring when the soil is somewhat bared by grazing      and cold weather. For small paddocks, you can run a garden      tiller lightly over the sod after it has been grazed down      and more bare earth is exposed. The freezing and thawing of      the soil surface in late winter and early spring allows the      seeds to come into good contact with the earth to sprout      and grow.    </p>    <p>      New seedings are liable to be weedy, but after one year of      grazing and a mowing, the clovers and grasses will      dominate. A few weeds in a grazing regimen are not bad:      They're often a better source of minerals than the grasses      and clovers.    </p>    <h3>      VARIATIONS    </h3>        <p>      The pure pasture method can be adjusted to include some      supplemental feed. Brad Billock and his wife, Ann, have      extra acreage and a barn on their property, which is why      they decided to start producing their own meat in the first      place. Every year they raise one beef for themselves and      one for friends. This way they earn enough money to cover      most of the cost of both steers. Animals are happier if      they have company, so two together thrive better than one.    </p>    <p>      Brad buys calves at about 300 pounds from local farmers.      (The county fair is a good place to go livestock shopping.)      He then feeds them out to about 1,000 pounds. In addition      to an acre of grass for grazing, Brad feeds shelled corn      and soybean meal, which he figures provides a little more      than a third of the calves' food.    </p>    <p>      "Most cattle feeders believe animals fatten faster on      cracked or milled corn," he says. "But shelled corn is      cheaper and the calves gain well enough for our purposes. I      add soybean meal to the ration for extra protein."    </p>    <p>      Brad also watches for free feed opportunities to supplement      what he has to buy. For example, after sweet corn harvest      he gathers the stalks and any ears left from all the      gardens in the neighborhood to feed as silage. The calves      will also eat pumpkins, squash and other garden surplus.    </p>    <p>      He keeps a salt-mineral block in the feed box for the      calves to lick. They get their water from a big trough      replenished by rainwater from the roof gutter on the barn.    </p>    <p>      Processing costs vary around the country, but in general,      figure about $150 per steer. A calf purchased at 300 pounds      costs around $300. If you want to play the proper      accountant, you have to add costs for labor, land and      hauling. A 1,000-pound steer will make about 600 pounds of      meat. If you figure its value on what you'd pay at the      supermarket, you come out well. If you figure value on what      a steer sells for in the regular farm market, you make only      a little profit beyond the superior taste of homegrown meat      and your assurance of what drugs were administered, if any,      while in your care.    </p>    <h3>      BUTCHERING    </h3>        <p>      <strong>Brad Billock raises two head of cattle each year,      one for his family and one for friends, which enables him      to earn enough money to cover the costs of raising and      processing</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>both steers.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Butchering a beef is a daunting home enterprise if you      don't have the proper tools and know-how, so Brad bought a      horse trailer to haul the steers to the slaughterhouse. (In      some areas there are slaughter-and-butchering operations      that will do it all at your place.) He figured he would      help pay for the trailer by renting it out to others in the      neighborhood who raise backyard beef, but so far he has      been too kindhearted to take any money.    </p>    <p>      The trailer makes loading cattle much easier than a truck      because the floor can be lowered down almost to ground      level and the animals can walk on without fear. My cow,      sniffing at the bucket of corn in my hand, followed me      right into the trailer. In the old days we used to have to      force animals up a slanted ramp into high-bed trucks,      always a frantic and difficult job.    </p>    <p>      Even with a modern trailer, it pays to pen your beef in the      barn and back the trailer to the door a day before you      attempt to load. Keep the trailer door and barn door open      so the animal can peer inside the trailer and get used to      it before loading. Put a little corn or good hay in the      trailer. The animal may walk in of its own accord or be      more inclined to board when you urge it.    </p>    <p>      FULL CIRCLE    </p>        <p>      Advanced grass farming is really only in its infancy, but      many books and farm magazines are available to keep you      informed of progress. <em>(The Stockman GrassFarmer</em> is      one of my favorites.) But even the most progressive      commercial grazing programs don't consider ideas the      backyard beef devotee can try. For example, you could use      one of your paddocks each myear for a combination vegetable      garden and sweet corn patch. The calves can eat what corn      you don't harvest, along with the surplus vegetables. Just      turn them into the garden paddock after the season is over.      They'll eat late weeds, too. You can lightly till that plot      and broadcast grass and clover seeds in winter or early      spring to re-establish your grasses and clovers.    </p>    <p>      There's much art and science in managing a rotational      grazing system, and there are more possibilities than first      meet the eye. If you make vegetable gardens and grain plots      part of your backyard pasture rotation and grow your own      supply of fish in the pond or tank that provides your      animals with water, you will have created a complete,      small-scale food-production system. You will have attained      what some professional graziers are beginning to accomplish      on larger acreages: a low-cost, environmentally intelligent      husbandry where most of the work of food production is done      by grazing animals and what you do is mostly brainwork.    </p>    <p>      It doesn't cost a bit to use your head.    </p>    <p>      Veteran homesteader, farmer and journalist Gene Logsdon has      written many fine books, including The Contrary Farmer and      Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream.    </p>
