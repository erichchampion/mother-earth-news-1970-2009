                <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S NATURE</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Terry Krautwurst    </h5>    <p>      Let me be the first to greet you happy new year. No, not      the first of sullen January, a day only calendar watching      human could consider noteworthy, Nature's new year, the      real deal: spring, Take a look around. See? The signs are      everywhere.    </p>        <h3>      LITTLE BIG CHORUS    </h3>    <p>      In some regions beginning as early as March, in others as      late as May, evenings ring with the shrill pipings of      spring peepers. Collectively the chorus rises and falls, a      lilting, pulsating chiming at once de licate, like tiny      bells, and deafening: The music can be heard for more than      a quarter of a mile. The voices are the mating calls of      males singing to silent females. Just how a female singles      out Mr. Right from among the choir is a mystery, though the      male's age is thought to be a factor. Larger, older males      sing faster and apparently more fetchingly. Listen      carefully and occasionally you may hear sharper trillings,      the notes and cadence more emphatic. These are "back off"      calls, warnings to other males trespassing on a singer's      territory of 4 to 14 square inches-a tiny bachelor pad, but      big enough for a frog only slightly larger than a human's      thumbnail.    </p>    <h3>      KITES IN THE SKY    </h3>    <p>      Hovering, swinging left, then right, dipping earthward,      rising buoyantly again: In April and May, falconlike      Mississippi kites-aptly named for their graceful, floating      flight-return to our skies from wintering grounds in      Brazil and Argentina. Nineteenth-century naturalist      Alexander Wilson first spotted the swooping, insect-eating      raptors on a Natchez plantation in 1810-thus the      Mississippi designation. Actually they're common throughout      the southern Great Plains and are found elsewhere in      varying numbers east and west, from Arizona and Colorado to      South Carolina. Loss of original habitat, described by      Audubon as along "rivers, lakes and bayous," and especially      in bald cypress swamps, has forced kites to seek nest sites      elsewhere, often in trees in notably human habitat such as      golf courses. Kites defend nests fiercely, diving at and      sometimes striking people who venture too close. Watch a      kite sweep the skies for large insects such as      grasshoppers, cicadas and dragonflies. With a screaming      high-pitched <em>phee phew</em> the bird plunges rocketlike      at a concentration of insects, brakes to snatch a victim,      then glides as it gobbles its meal on the fly.    </p>        <h3>      DECEPTIVE LADIES    </h3>    <p>      Think of orchids and you probably envision exotic tropical      blooms. But orchids are the largest family of flowering      plants, with at least 25,000 species described, and many      grow in temperate regions. Among our largest and most      common are the pink lady's slippers, which in early spring      pop up like pink-chiffoned prom dates on a bare gym floor,      brightening otherwise drab pine-oak forests across most of      eastern North America. The plants get their name (and their      nickname, moccasin flower) from the shoeshaped lower petal,      a bulbous pouch with a deep ridge in the front: an      enticing, one-way path for pollinators. Lured inside by      droplets of sweet fluid (lady's slippers don't secrete true      nectar), the pollinator, most often a mining bee, can      escape only through one of two small exits at the sac's      rear. To get there it must push its pollen-covered back      beneath the plant's stigma, or female part, thus      pollinating the plant. On its way out, a fleshy, green disc      showers its back with pollen for the next come-hither      orchid. Not all lady's slippers-in-waiting are pollinated      before they wither. But just one mature seed pod produces      10,000 seeds, helping to ensure future generations.    </p>    <h3>      LUMBERING LOTHARIOS    </h3>    <p>      You'd think a veggie-loving animal that had slept three to      six months without eating-and lost 40 percent of its body      weight in the process-would head straight for the nearest      salad pickings. But woodchucks awakened from their long      winter's naps are driven by hunger of another sort. Males      immediately go burrow-hopping in search of females, which      in turn do not play hard to get. The brief period during      which a pair mates is virtually the only time adult      woodchucks share a burrow. The male soon moves on; the      female gives birth a month later to four or five blind,      furless, toothless pups. At three months the young leave to      establish their own burrows and gobble all the food they      can before winter.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SUGAR RUSH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Its true that sap rises with the coming of spring. But sap      falls, too, and moves side ways within a tree's elaborate      circulatory system. Sap flow is hardly the sole domain of      spring. Throughout the growing season, hollow vessels in a      tree's sapwood, or xylem, conduct water and nutrients up      from the roots to the leaves. Meanwhile, water laden with      sugars and other products of photosynthesis flows downward      from leaves to the branches, trunk and roots through      pipelike cells in the phloem, or inner bark. In summer,      transpiration-the loss of water vapor through leaves-is the      pump that powers this two-way system. But the flow slows      when a tree loses its leaves in autumn. Sugars are stored      as starches in the trunk and roots for the winter. Then      spring. Just before leaves unfurl, the starches change back      into sugars, and root pressure-caused by water sucked from      the soil-pushes a rush of sugary sap up through the tree to      feed new plant parts. It's this short-lived gush of      concentrated, pent-up sugars we humans eagerly tap into for      syrup. Within weeks, freshly photosynthesizing leaves      produce enzymes that make even a sugar maple trees sap less      palatable.    </p>        <p>      Gardeners know too well the groundhog's gluttony and often      welcome the animals with a .22-gun salute. But there's a      good side to woodchucks, too: Their burrows provide homes      for all manner of other wildlife, including rabbits,      turtles and toads. Groundhogs also influence community      plant diversity. By nibbling away perennials in the areas      around their burrows, they provide nursery beds for      seedproducing annuals, which supply food for birds and      small mammals.    </p>    <p>      You say woodchucks; I say groundhogs Either way, their      fleeting connubial bliss is dependable sign of spring.    </p>    <h3>      DRUMMER BOYS    </h3>    <p>      The ruffed grouse, named for the black ruff feathers the      male puffs up like an over size fur collar during courtship      displays, is the most widespread native game bird in North      America: a forest resident in nearly three dozen states and      all of Canada's provinces. In the Far North it shares range      with the spruce grouse, a bird otherwise known as a fool      hen for its unwise habit of standing in the open and      gawking at ap approaching humans. The ruffed grouse, in      contrast, is secretive, elusive and quick to take flight      hikers and hunters seldom get more than a glimpse.      Sometimes, though (and in spring, often), you can hear the      male's distinctive love call, a drumbeat that starts with a      slow thump ... thump ... thump, and then quickens to a      baritone roll. The sound was once thought to be produced by      the bird's wings beating against its chest or a hollow log.      But stop-motion photographs revealed the sound is made by      the bird's cupped wings rapidly striking and compressing      the air.    </p>        <p>      Of course, there's another sure-fire sign of spring, too: a      distinctly human phenomenon known as spring fever. Like      leaves bursting from winter buds, we throw open our cabin      doors and breathe anew. Ah, spring at last: fresh, honest      air, amiable weather, a clean slate, a whole new go at      exploring life. Happy new year, indeed.		</p>			<p>				A handsome ruffed grouse emerges to search for the girl grouse of his dreams.		</p>			<p>      Terry Krautwurst, a former senior editor for MOTHER EARTH      NEWS, is a nature writer who explores the world from his      home in the mountains of western North Carolina.    </p>
