                <p>      <strong>VIEW POINT</strong>    </p>            <p>      In his speech to the first Earth Day participant in April      1970, organizer Denis Hayes made it clear the event was a      beginning, not a one-hit wonder. "If the environment is a      fad, it's going to be our last fad," he announced to the      thousands gathered that bright, spring day in Washington,      D.C. "We are building a movement, a movement with a broad      base, a movement which transcends traditional political      boundaries. It is a movement that values people more than      technology, people more than political boundaries, people      more than profit."    </p>    <p>      Idealistic words for an idealistic generation. And the fact      is, that idealism paid off. Concern for a clean, healthy      environment has become a part of our national ethos. Not      one that's heeded at all times by a people, but one that's      here to stay. Remember: Earth Day wasn't handed down to      Americans from on high by an anonymous, all knowing      government, nor by savvy corporate marketers. It arose      because a concerned and educated citizenry was calling for      a response to the environmental hazards that seemed to be      erupting at every turn. American citizens decided accepting      a deteriorating environment was not good enough for them.      We expected change, and we produced it. That fact is both a      history lesson and a blueprint.    </p>    <p>      One of the most dramatic changes many of us made during the      late 1960s and early '70s was the belief-no, the      certainty-that the Earth is not made up of humans and      a huge, dumb collection of things-trees, rocks,      rivers, animals, air-for us to shove around and      exploit in any old way we please. We read Rachel Carson and      Aldo Leopold, Alan Watts, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,      Frances Moore Lappe, Ram Dass and others on a long,      nourishing list. We shifted our perspective, slowed      ourselves down and began to notice the world as a living,      breathing beauty, an animate environment of which we humans      are a portion, but not its possessors. We saw that we      belong to the Earth, it does not belong to us. Our planet,      our home, is not a dead carcass awaiting whatever butchery,      feeds our latest hunger. It lives; we live in it and only      in it. This is the knowledge of which transformations are      made.    </p>    <p>      Seeing the photos of the Earth taker:` from the Apollo      space missions, we understood once and for all how tiny wpb      were amid ineffable vastness. We realized"` for the first      time how finite our resources are and how inescapably our      destinies are interwoven with that of our precious, perfect      planet. We called it our Little Blue Marble, quoting Apollo      17 astronaut Charlie Duke, who described Earth after seeing      it from the moon. The phrase became trite with overuse, but      at that time it gave us a means to express an affection for      Earth we hadn't had the language to articulate. When in      history had the human race been able to grasp so utterly      and so graphically our place in the web of life? As with      other moments of falling in love, once we truly saw the      world and our connection to it, nothing could ever be the      same.    </p>    <p>      For some, the environmental movement has always been about      standing at a barricade, drawing attention to the      horrendous, the outrageous, or simply the unfair in      relation to human interaction with the environment. Protest      can be valuable because it draws attention to an issue,      draws a line in the sand. Rebellion can spark, but it      cannot sustain change. Rebellion alone doesn't provide      context, and without context humans cannot alter their      behavior. Earth Day was born out of broad-based citizen      insistence that attention be paid to the environment: It      was, first and foremost, an enormous educational event. It      provided a context for thousands and thousands of people to      think differently about the environment. And that thinking      changed us forever.    </p>        <p>      <em>â€º</em> For many of us, this education has been a      work in progress ever since. We don't see ourselves      necessarily being involved in a movement, but in motion, a      timeless two step that partners the Earth's needs with our      own. What we appreciate becomes more simple, and sometimes      distressingly difficult to find. We embrace      sensibility-making sense, being deeply acquainted      with our senses. We want to taste our food and find it      delicious-pure, full of health and flavor. We want to      feel our bodies from the inside out and know they are as      healthy as our choices can make them. We want to smell the      air and feel the yearning of our lungs for more, rather      than the shying away and shutting down that occurs when air      is foul. We want to know the sweetness of sparkling, clean      water. We want the solid confidence of knowing we can      create and craft our own solutions to the situations we      face.    </p>    <p>      We sense community built to human scale is the only thing      that will allow the unpredictable beauty of our natures to      emerge. Otherwise we are things, not beings. We want      communities-rural, urban, suburban-that have      emotional and physical space for beings, communities woven      with elastic, not rigidly hammered into place. We want to      see technology and industry serve nature and community, not      the other, dreary way around.    </p>    <p>      That Little Blue Marble photo juxtaposed with a photo of my      son working in our little garden represent the strands of a      thread woven through many of our lives since those early      Earth Days. My pursuit of the personal-a healthy      garden, nutritious food thoughtfully prepared for those I      love, a domestic life that nurtured my children, an      existence as homespun as I could manage, a life that was      kind to the Earth-rooted me in the World Out There,      microcosm reflecting and connecting to macrocosm. Life      nurturing life nurturing Life.    </p>    <p>      Some of us let those early sensibilities slide during the      '80s and '90s as we marched off in pursuit of other goals.      Others never strayed from those earlier values and are      richer now for their steadfastness. Recent events have      reawakened all of us in varying degrees to the vastly      interdependent nature of life here on our beautiful Earth.      We find ourselves asking with renewed urgency what life on      this planet needs, not only to survive, but to      thrive-and looking to see how we can provide for      those needs. We'll all come up with different answers, but      in the end the actions we take will add up to something      worthy.    </p>    <p>      Earth Day, every day. It's not too much to expect.    </p>    <p>      K. C. Compton is managing editor of    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.
