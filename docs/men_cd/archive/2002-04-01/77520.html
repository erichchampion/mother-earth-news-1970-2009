                <p>      <strong>NATURAL HEALTH</strong>    </p>    		<p>(Without going under the knife)</p>		<h5 id="byline">By James A. Duke, Ph.D.</h5>    <p>      Both my wife and I share a propensity for back problems.      Peggy is a good example of how back problems often run in      families. She and her two sisters (like their late mother)      have a peculiar kink in the same area of their backs that      causes them grief, especially following extended kitchen      work at sink height.    </p>        <p>      Scrooge that I am, I blame my most serious back problem on      Christmas. It was December 23, 1991, when Peggy and I went      to a nearby Christmas tree farm to select a living tree.      Wanting to replant the tree, I dug a big ball of earth with      it and managed to heave the whole thing into the      wheelbarrow the owner had lent me. I successfully wheeled      that 100-pound load 100 yards up the hill to my station      wagon, but when I attempted to lift it from the wheelbarrow      to the wagon's trunk, something snapped.    </p>    <p>      Agony ensued. It grew worse as we drove home. Santa's back      was ruined. I could not lie, sit or stand comfortably. I      slept terribly, sideways on a couch with three pillows      under my left side. The only help we could find the      following day, Christmas Eve, was a chiropractor. He took a      $95 X-ray, declined to do major manipulations and said I      should see an orthopedist.    </p>        <p>      A week later the orthopedist said I should consult a      neurosurgeon. Not surprisingly he said I needed surgery. He      insisted this was my only option, given my X-rays. So      ultimately (two months later), I had surgery, followed by      physical therapy. I also used healing herbs and had      acupuncture treatments. I think the alternative treatments      gave me more relief than the physicians.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BACKACHES ABOUND</strong>    </p>    <p>      It seems everywhere I look, people have back problems.      That's not surprising, since aching backs are one of      America's most prevalent health pr oblems. Estimates vary,      but the experts generally agree that somewhere between 2      million and 5 million Americans suffer serious back pain      each year.    </p>    <p>      At some point in life, about four out of five Americans      experience back pain severe enough to require medical      intervention-anything from taking aspirin to having major      surgery. And at any given moment, something like      one-quarter of the country is dealing with previous back      trouble by taking medication, doing exercises or making      other lifestyle adjustments to convalesce and keep from      reinjuring their backs.    </p>    <p>      Bad backs also cost the country a fortune, $16 billion a      year in medical treatment and $80 billion in lost wages and      productivity.    </p>        <p>      <strong>BE WARY OF SURGERY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Doctors used to treat back pain with rest, long-term      medication and surgery. Now they generally recommend      short-term medication, exercise and increasingly,      chiropractic, yoga or some other formerly scorned      alternative therapy.    </p>    <p>      I'm glad surgery has fallen out of favor. My own back      surgery seemed useless. I did not seek a second opinion,      even though friends advised me to. Why? Because I'm a lazy      cheapskate who goes with the flow of a health management      organization (HMO), and I wanted so desperately to put my      back pain behind me.    </p>    <p>      I'll go to my grave not knowing whether the surgery did me      any good. I have since learned cervical fusion-the      operation I endured-is one of those over performed      operations. I found out bad X-rays don't always mean bad      backs and good X-rays don't always mean good backs. I      learned 80 percent of people in the kind of distress I had      recover in four months without surgery.    </p>    <p>      But unrelating pain makes people desprate.We Americans      undergo a lot less back surgery than we used to, but      <strong>there are still about 20 minutes more back      operations per capita in the United States than in Canada      and Europe.</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the meantime , What you can do about the pain      Immediately after a back in-jury or a flare-up of back      pain, doctors recommend pain-relieving and      anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin and other      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For really bad pain,      stronger medications might be necessary, including codeine      or other narcotics. If you're in serious pain, I'd suggest      taking whatever the doctor orders. Recently physicians have      become more inclined to give slow-release morphine, which      comes from the opium poppy.    </p>        <p>      <strong>GREEN PHARMACY FOR BACKACHE</strong>		</p>		<p>				For lesser      pain or lingering pain, a number of herbal alternatives can      prove helpful.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Red pepper</strong> (Capsicum, various species).      Red pepper contains a marvelous pain-relieving      chemical-capsaicin-that is so potent a tiny amount provides      the active ingredient in some powerful pharmaceutical      topical analgesics. One over-the-counter product, Zostrix,      contains only 0.025 percent capsaicin. At this point I      don't know (or care) whether red pepper's effectiveness is      due to capsaicin's ability to interfere with our perception      of pain, to the herb's ability to trigger a release of the      body's own pain relieving endorphins, to its salicylates,      or to all three. All I know is that it works.    </p>    <p>      You can buy a commercial cream containing capsaicin and use      that. Outside the United States, however, people simply use      red pepper. You can, too, at considerable savings. A hot      pepper costs a few  cents, while capsaicin drugs cost a few      dollars. You can mash a red pepper and rub it directly on      the painful area. You can also take any white skin cream      you have on hand-cold cream will do-and mix in enough red      pepper to turn it pink. Whether you use a cream or a hot      pepper, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterward:      You don't want to get it in your eyes or other sensitive      areas. Since some people are quite sensitive to this      compound, you should test it on a small area of skin to      make sure that it's OK for you to use before using it on a      larger area. If it seems to irritate your skin, discontinue      use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Willow</strong> (Salix, various species) and other      forms of natural aspirin. I have no problem with taking      aspirin, since it was originally derived from an herbal      source. It originally came from compounds known as      salicylates that occur naturally in willow bark,      meadowsweet and wintergreen. Any of these herbs can be made      into pain-relieving teas. Many salicylate-rich plants also      contain methyl-salicylate, an aspirin-like compound with a      particularly pleasing smell. One is wintergreen. Another is      birch bark, once used by American Indians to make a tea      they drank or applied externally to treat lower-back pain.      On occasion I have made such teas by throwing roughly a      handful of birch bark or wintergreen into a cup or two of      boiling water and letting it steep for about 10 minutes.      (Remember, though, if you're allergic to aspirin, you      probably shouldn't use aspirin-like herbs, either.) Oil of      wintergreen, which is high in methyl-salicylate, also      serves as a good pain reliever for external use. It may be      applied during massage. (Make sure you keep oil of      wintergreen out of children's reach. It has a tempting      aroma, but ingesting even a little can prove fatal.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Peppermint</strong> (Mentha piperita) and other      mints. You will find the compounds menthol and camphor in      many over-the counter backache medications. They are      chemicals that can help ease the muscle tightness that      contributes to many bad backs. Menthol is a natural      constituent of plants in the mint family, particularly      peppermint and spearmint, although the aromatic oils of all      the other mints contain it, as well. Camphor occurs in      spike lavender, hyssop and coriander.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Assorted essential oils.</strong> Massage treatment      with essential oils can often help relieve the painful      muscle spasms that contribute to back pain. Several of      these sage, rosemary, thyme, horsebalm and mountain      dittany--are rich in thymol and carvacrol, compounds that      help muscles relax.    </p>    <p>      To use any of these oils, add a few drops to a couple of      tablespoons of any vegetable oil and massage the oil      mixture directly into the affected area. You might also add      a few drops of the oil to a hot bath and soak for a while,      inhaling the steamy vapors. (Remember, though, never ingest      an essential oil, as small quantities of some oils, on the      order of a single teaspoon, can be fatal.)    </p>    <p>      Other compounds with potent muscle relaxing action that can      relieve back spasms are borneol and bornyl-acetate. Plants      rich in these chemicals include cardamom, sage and      rosemary. My database tells me borneol is an effective      antispasmodic compound at a very diluted concentration,      making it even more potent than menthol, camphor, thymol      and carvacrol.    </p>    <p>      There are also a few other oils you should know about.      Aromatherapists often suggest using the oils of birch,      lavender, black pepper, clary, ginger and marjoram to      alleviate backache. I would not hesitate to use any of      these, as all have a folkloric history for relieving cramps      or backaches, and all contain pain-relieving and muscle      relaxing compounds.    </p>    <p>      Why use the plant oil if you can obtain chemically isolated      menthol or some other muscle-relaxing chemical? Because, in      my opinion, the whole aromatic herb oil is likely to work      better. These oils evolved to protect the plants from pests      and other environmental stresses. The fact that aromatic      herb oils evolved into a chemically complex mixture      suggests all the chemicals in them work together.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Moving toward a</strong> <strong>Cure</strong>		</p>			<p>				One of the worst things you can do for an aching back is to a      stop exercising, according to Leon Root, M.D., orthopedic      surgeon and author of <em>Oh, My Aching</em> Back. In fact,      exercise experts claim 80 percent to 90 percent of back      problems are caused by weak muscles. Doctors have also come      around to this view and now recommend gentle exercise      instead of rest.    </p>    <p>      I can attest to the effectiveness of this approach. I do      back exercises religiously every morning before my shower      and also before and after activities I know can trigger      back pain: cutting my lawn (more than an acre), standing in      long lines or at cocktail parties, and moving heavy      objects. I swim when the opportunity arises, ride a      stationary bike and walk a mile or two a day.<br />    </p>    <p>      The YMCA has developed a popular nationwide back-exercise      program that combines strength training, flexibility      exercises and relaxation. About 80 percent of enrollees      report improvement, and 31 percent become pain-free. You      might want to contact your local YMCA and ask about this      program. Think about it: About one-third of bad backs can      be cured with no medicine at all.    </p>    <p>      Look for more excerpts from James Duke's The Green Pharmacy      (See MOTHER'S Bookshelf, Page 120) in future issues of      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.
