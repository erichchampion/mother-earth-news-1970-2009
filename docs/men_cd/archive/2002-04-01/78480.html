                <p>      <strong>ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>The case for solar-powered.</em>		</p>		<p>				The world is clearly      running out of oil and gas, yet most people ignore the      coming crisis. Food production and distribution in the      industrialized world have become so dependent on petroleum      use, it's hard to imagine how agriculture will function      without this fuel.    </p>        <p>      The most promising option is solar-powered electric      tractors, which offer several advantages over gas      diesel-powered tractors. Electric motors can operate at      more than 90 percent efficiency, while combustion engines      are less than 15 percent efficient. Electric propulsion is      ideally suited to high torque, slow-speed agricultural      operations. Electric motors have only one moving part and      require little maintenance. Internal combustion engines, on      the other hand, have hundreds of moving parts and require a      lot of maintenance.    </p>    <p>      Electric motors don't idle, which saves energy. Plus. while      the vehicle is going downhill or braking, an electric motor      can become a generator and return energy to the battery.      This process, called regenerative braking, further      increases the efficiency of electric propulsion and cannot      be duplicated using other technologies. Electric-wheel      motors eliminate the need for an internal combustion      engine, transmission and differential. allowing new options      in the design of tractors. Mounting an electric motor in      the hub creates a self-propelled wheel that can provide new      levels of versatility and visibility.    </p>    <p>      If an electric tractor is combined with photovoltaic (PV)      charging, whether on the tractor itself in the form of a      solar panel shade canopy or on the roof of a building, no      other fuel source is necessary N . Unbreakable PV panels      and PV roofing that can turn any sunny surface into a power      station are now available with a 20-year warranty.      <strong>Photovoltaics provide an ideal energy source for      agriculture because the growing season coincides with the      availability of solar energy.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The biggest obstacle to the performance of most electric      <em>automobiles is</em> battery weight. Unlike automobiles,      tractors depend on weight for traction, thus heavy,      deep-cycle, lead-acid batteries that are inex pensive,      recyclable and long-lived can be used to great advantage in      an electric tractor.    </p>    <p>      In addition to an onboard battery pack between the traction      wheels, auxiliary battery packs can be loaded on the      tractor's three-point hitches to balance implement weight      and extend operating time. Electric linear actuators      (no-maintenance screwjacks that push and pull) replace less      efficient hydraulics for steering and for positioning the      three-point hitches. The electric tractor can include a      separate power take-off (PTO) motor that can be sized for      specific needs and operate independent of ground speed.    </p>    <p>      Even now, when gas and oil are still affordable, there are      many applications for a nonpolluting electric tractor      powered from renewable sources. These include greenhouses      and organic farms where air quality must be high; golf      courses surrounded by expensive homes where noise is a      concern; planting and harvesting where very slow speeds are      necessary; and remote control operation where safety is      important. Solar-electric tractors also have multiple      applications in nonindustrialized countries, which lack      fossil-fuel infrastructure and low fuel prices. The      electric tractor can also replace petroleum-powered      generators as a mobile power source in remote areas and in      emergency applications.      <strong>Because the electric tractor is made from modular      components, it can be assembled in any small shop and does      not require a large, energy intensive manufacturing      facility.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Agriculture as practiced in the industrialized world today      is far from sustainable. Eighty years of petroleum      dependence has degraded Earth's life support system to the      point where maintaining air, water and soil quality is no      longer enough. Humanity's survival depends on regaining      environmental quality. The only source of energy capable of      replacing fossil fuels is the source that made them. The      petroleum resource may last another 50 years, but the sun      won't burn out for 5.5 billion years. Which resource do you      think makes the most sense?    </p>        <p>      <strong>The Electric Ox</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Electric Ox is a towing tractor aimed primarily at      greenhouse and industrial users. The Electric Ox MP      (multipurpose) model adds attachments, such as a mower      deck, rotary sweeper, snow thrower and dozer blade with a      patented system that claims two-minute exchange times. Both      models offer quiet operation and zero source emissions and      are proving popular for grounds maintenance at schools,      hospitals, retirement residences and high-density housing      sites. The Electric Ox is also a good candidate for some      postal routes, warehouses, golf courses, underground      construction sites and airports.    </p>    <p>      The 790-pound tractor-no oil, gas, engines, transmissions,      belts and pulleyswill turn inside an aisle 10 feet wide,      will tow up to 6 tons of wheeled cargo, and is available      with either a 36-volt or 48-volt battery pack. The      manufacturer says the 36-volt tractor is equivalent to an      18 horsepower to 20 horsepower gas tractor and provides      five hours of mowing/sweeping or 12 hours of towing at a      top speed of 5 mph. The 48-volt tractor increases the      overall speed and power by 30 percent and run times by 20      percent to 25 percent.    </p>    <p>      The Electric Ox models use a single pedal for acceleration      and regenerative braking. Jim Laidlaw, president of      Electric Tractor Corporation, says, "Regenerative braking      allows us to capture and use energy that is otherwise lost      during slowing or braking ... and eliminates the need for      traditional mechanical brakes and the maintenance      associated with them." This feature is integrated with an      automatic braking system that sets a parking brake when the      vehicle is motionless, the foot is off the pedal or faults      occur in the control system.    </p>    <p>      Optional 900-watt or 1,500-watt inverters enable the      Electric Ox to act as a silent, standalone power source for      120-volt power tools, pumps, lighting and motors at remote      sites.    </p>    <p>      The 36-volt Electric Ox ($7,350, U.S. dollars) and the      48-volt unit ($8,250) include horn, gauge, hour meter,      lights, onboard charger and suspension seat. Inverters are      $795 (900 watts) and $995 (1,500 watts). Attachments      include a 44-inch mower deck ($1,495), sweeper blade/brush      ($1,150) and 48inch dozer blade ($475).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Electric Tractor Specifications</strong>    </p>    <p>      · Two 10-horsepower, variable speed wheel motors for      60 horsepower of traction<br />      ·Separate 500 to 1,000 rpm power takeoff (PTO) motor      will run all standard PTO and three-point hitch      implements<br />      · Onboard five kilowatt-hour battery pack for all      day light-duty applications, such as planting and      harvesting.<br />      · Standard Category 1 front and rear three-point      hitches, Each use two linear actuators (1,500-pound      capacity)<br />      · Adjustable seat with controls on arm rests<br />      · Total weight under 2,000 pounds<br />      · 11x24-inch traction wheels<br />      · 5 1/2 x 16-inch steering wheels<br />      · Overall dimensions: 110-inch to 12-inch adjustable      length, 87-inch height, 48-inch to 72-inch adjustable      width<br />      · Zero turning radius steering<br />      · 20-inch ground clearance    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Heckeroth Handmade Solar Tractor</strong>    </p>    <p>      Steve Heckeroth has been building and testing solar tractor      prototypes since 1992. His latest design, shown at left and      below, includes the specifications in the box below and      features a multiposition seat that allows the tractor to      perform a multitude of operations, which otherwise only      could be accomplished with several conventional machines.      All the controls are mounted on the arm rests, connected      only by small flexible wires to radio control transmitters.    </p>        <p>      Multiple Seat Positions Forward high position: The same as      on conventional tractors but allows unobstructed visibility      for operations like precision cultivation. Reverse seat      position: Here the solar electric tractor can replace      several other conventional machines. Loaders and forklifts      are designed to put weight on the traction wheels and take      weight off the steering wheels for optimum performance.      High-end commercial mowers are configured to put the      implement out front for visibility and maneuverability. The      operation of other implements, like post-hole diggers and      backhoes, can also benefit from the reverse seat operation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Planting and harvesting:</strong>      The seat can be mounted on the mid or rear three      point-hitch and raised or lowered for planting and      harvesting operations.		</p>			<p>				Hundreds of pounds of seedlings or      harvested crop can be stored on accessible trays, and the      other available three-point-hitch can be used at the same      time to carry a water tank, cultivator or bed-preparation      implement.      <strong>Off tractor position:</strong>      The relative ease of operating an electric vehicle by      remote or computer control allows the seat to be removed      from the tractor. This makes the electric tractor suited      for repetitive agricultural operations, bomb disposal, mine      sweep, toxic cleanup and some road maintenance      applications.<br />      <br />      To learn more about the potential of this <em>brilliant      tractor</em> design, go to www.renewables.com .      <em>Somebody should buy</em> the rights from Steve      <em>and</em> put this <em>baby</em> into <em>production.
