                    <h5>Story and photos by Deanna Mather Larson </h5>    <p>A little surplus space in your barn cangive you some extra cash each month.</p>        <p>      As with empty stalls in many barns, ours were filled with      junk. With a bit of work and a small cash investment, my      husband and I turned these unoccupied spaces into      moneymakers. After a few improvements, we advertised "Horse      boarding." Two months later both stalls were rented and we      had an extra $400 each month. You can do it, too. Here's      how.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING STARTED</strong>    </p>    <p>      To decide if horse boarding is for you, check out      facilities in your area. Ask what they charge and what they      offer. Barns have different levels of boarding, from full      service, where feed and care is provided-to basic      stall rental-where the client does everything. Visit      a few barns. If you see clients, ask them what they like      and dislike about their barn. Look at the size and      condition of the stalls. How are feed and tack stored?      What's used for bedding and how is soiled bedding handled?    </p>    <p>      While it's important to have some knowledge of horses, you      don't need to be an expert. Most veterinarians and horse i      trainers are willing to share information.    </p>    <p>      Determine a price for your stalls by considering the nature      of your facility, ongoing expenses and startup cost. We      spent $1,000 making our two stalls and pastures ready for      boarding. We decided to offer full-service care, so I      estimated the additional monthly cost of feed, hay and      utilities. Because we didn't have an indoor arena, we      charged less than top price. Still, six months later our      rental stalls had paid the debt and begun turning a profit.    </p>    <p>      Plan for backup help to take over chores when you're gone.      It's important to let your boarders know when you'll be      away and who will care for their horses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SETTING UP</strong>    </p>        <p>      Empty your stalls, clean and disinfect the area. We rented      a power washer and used a diluted bleach solution. Inspect      your stalls for loose boards or other problems. Some horses      crib (chew on wood), so we strapped a length of rigid      electrical conduit to the top edges. Horses may dig, so      stall mats are a necessity. Each horse needs a daily supply      of fresh water. For safety and convenience, stalls need a      light directly overhead.    </p>    <p>      If you have an arena, clean it up and rework the surface if      needed. Clear riding trails. We mowed tracks around our      field and along a nearby river bank.    </p>    <p>      Plan to store boarders' feed in a separate bin.      Thirty-gallon plastic garbage cans are ideal. They hold 150      pounds of rolled oats, and the snap-lock lids guard against      rodent contamination. Add a saddle rack for each client in      your tack room. I built tack lockers mounted on a wall.      Each 30-inch square locker has a saddle rack, hooks for      gear and room for grooming tools. The doors can be      padlocked.    </p>    <p>      Assess ways to dispose of soiled bedding. Dumping on your      property is one choice. Some forest products or garden      supply companies haul away horse manure and bedding, which      they compost and resell. Remember to figure their fee into      your cost analysis.    </p>    <p>      If you plan to offer pasture, fence off individual areas      for each horse. Barbed wire is not acceptable around      horses. An electrified top wire will discourage      over-the-fence biting. Position gates so there's individual      access to each pasture. We use tubular gates with      welded-wire panels, which prevent horses from putting a      head or foot through the gate.    </p>    <p>      You need a continuous source of water to outside troughs.      We installed float valves and shut-off valves so I can      clean the troughs or drain the system in winter if      necessary.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROTECTION</strong>    </p>		     <p>      Most states have an Equine Activity Statute. This law      recognizes the inherent risks associated with horses and      protects horse businesses from unwarranted legal action.      Some statutes require the boarder to sign a release.      Alaska, California, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New York and      Pennsylvania have no such law. If your state is covered,      post a copy of the official notice in your barn. Most horse      supply outlets sell these signs. Farm insurance policies      offer more coverage than typical homeowners' policies.      Consult your agent for clarification of your coverage.      Before allowing any new horse on your grounds, require a      certificate of veterinary inspection to confirm the health      of the horse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NEW HORSE CHECK-IN</strong>    </p>        <p>      The client is responsible for grooming, worming,      vaccinations and hoof trims, but you need to get the names      and telephone numbers of the veterinarian and farrier. Ask      about the horse's diet. If you're providing pasture and the      horse hasn't been on grass, it will need a gradual      introduction. Get telephone numbers for the client and at      least one emergency contact for when the client is      unavailable.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROUTINE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Designate separate water buckets fen each stall. I clean      the buckets weekly and use a bleach rinse monthly. If you      use a hose to fill buckets or water troughs, never allow it      to contact the container or the water inside: A      contaminated hose can pass disease.    </p>    <p>      Horses thrive on routine. Turn them in and out and feed      them at the same times every day. It's also good business      to clean the stalls daily. We bed with fir shavings because      fir has no oils that ran cause allergic reactions in      horses. Our two additional horses added only 20 minutes to      my daily chore tune. During the summer we leave the horses      in their pastures, only bringing them in for their two      feedings. This allows the stalls to dry, discouraging mold      and bacteria growth. If there's a heavy rainstorm, I bring      the horses in that night.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BOOKKEEPING</strong>    </p>    		<p>				Have an attorney approve a      contract for your boarders to sign. (See "Contract for      Horse Boarding," Page 89.) If your state's Equine Activity      Statute requires a signed release, include it with the      contract. Start a file for each stall and keep all      pertinent information. Consult an accountant for a complete      list of tax-deductible expenses. Using separate bins to      store boarders' grain helps track the number of sacks you      use. Feed from separate hay bales and keep count. We board      in two of our five stalls, so I charge two-fifths of the      bedding expense to the business.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MARKETING</strong>    </p>    <p>      You don't need to spend much money on marketing. Most feed      stores have bulletin boards where you can hang a poster.      Check tack and western-apparel shops for similar boards.      Put up a sign near your place. The look of your sign and      posters reflects the professionalism of your business. Our      sign says "Horse Boarding," and gives our telephone number.      It sits on a post at the head of the road. When people      call, give them a brief explanation of your services and      invite them to visit.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SOMETHING SPECIAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Boarders appreciate our little extras. I'm fussy about      cleaning stalls and use a granulated clay product to      eliminate odors and moisture. Each stall is plumbed for      water. A supply of my homemade, nontoxic fly repellent is      always available for clients. They also appreciate the      intercom between the house and barn. It's locked in the on      position so I can monitor horse activity from the house.      Another favorite is the lighting over the stalls, which are      on a timer giving the horses an hour of light to dine by.      It didn't take long to discover the hidden treasure of our      business. We have a little extra income, and the enjoyment      of two more beautiful horses and two horse lovers-our kind      of people.    </p>    <p>      <em>Deanna Mather Larson uses tubular pasture gates with      welded-wire panels, which prevent the horses from putting      heads or feet through the fencing. Barbed wire is not      acceptable around horses, but electrifying the top wire      will discourage over-the-fence biting.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Resources</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>For more Information on Enquire Activity Statutes by      state try www.horse-insurance.com/law.html .
