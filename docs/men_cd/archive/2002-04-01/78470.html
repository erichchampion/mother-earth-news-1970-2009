        <p><strong>Green Gazette</strong></p><p>During the 1970s energy crisis, many designers and builders plunged into passive solar home construction. Most soon found that passive solar design is simple in concept, but a challenge in reality. Even small errors in design spawned major problems,such as overheating or freezing at night.</p><p>Today barriers to passive solar design are falling, thanks in part to sophisticated building software like Energy-10 from the Sustainable Buildings Industry Council in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Energy-10 allows architects, contractors and owner-builders to analyze passive-solar designs for energy performance at any stage of development. It also permits them to fine-tune their building designs to eke out additional energy savings and increase comfort levels. Perhaps the best feature allows the creation of region-specific building designs to help ensure optimal performance and comfort in a wide variety of climates.</p><p>As the simplest alternative energy system, a passive solar structure relies on south-facing glass, hefty insulation and thermal mass to capture and retain the sun's energy. A well-built solar home can slash heating bills by 25 percent to 80 percent.</p><p>Early passive solar designs sometimes failed to live up to expectations because the interactions between the solar home, climate and site are so complex. But Energy-10 software performs complicated calculations with click-of-the-button simplicity, including ranking energysaving features and determining the necessary size of backup heating and cool ing systems.</p><p>Energy-10 does have weaknesses. I found the building options, especially roof systems, limited. Natural builders will need to customize the program a bit to use it successfully. The regional design feature lacks some solar radiation data.</p><p>The complete package sells for $250, but the Council is offering a generous $50 discount for <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> readers who provide the code MEM-02 with their order. The $200 package includes Designing Low-Energy Buildings, a well-written introduction to passive solar design and use of the software.</p><p><em>-Dan Chiras</em></p><p>For more information, contact: Sustainable Buildings Industry Council, 1331 H St., NW, Suite 1000, Washington, D.C. 20005-4706; (202) 628-7400;</p><p><a href="http://www.sbicouncii.org/" target="_blank">www.sbicouncii.org</a>.</p>
