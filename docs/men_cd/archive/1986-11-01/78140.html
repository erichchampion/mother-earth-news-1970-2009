    <p>
                        <p>      Here's a rundown on insects that have bugged my greenhouse.      (In gener al, insect problems are worst in midwinter when I      can't vent as much as I should.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Whiteflies</strong> are notorious pests. For best      control, trap them on yellow cards or boards coated with      something sticky like Vaseline or Tanglefoot. (Whiteflies      are attracted to the color yellow.) I buy Sticky      Strips-gooey-surfaced pieces of plastic-from a      greenhouse supplier and poke them into the soil around my      plants.    </p>    <p>      When whiteflies badly infested my cucumber and Chinese      cabbage vines, I achieved fairly good control by spraying      them with Safer's insecticidal soap. (Other gardeners use      Basic H or mild household soap.) Test the solution on a      single plant first to be sure your crop isn't sensitive to      it. Because whitefly eggs hatch 10 days after they're laid,      apply the soap every 7 to 10 days for several weeks to      control succeeding generations.    </p>    <p>      Phosphorus or magnesium soil deficiencies can promote      whitefly infestations. Apply wood ashes or bonemeal to add      phosphorus, and dolomite limestone for magnesium.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Aphids</strong> are less active than whiteflies,      but just as damaging. They often attack plants dosed with      too much nitrogen. If you overdo the manure tea, dig in      some sawdust; as it rots, it'll absorb some of the excess      N. (Don't use cedar, walnut, or redwood sawdust-these      contain plant toxins.) Soap sprays kill aphids, but also      harm beneficial insects. For a safer treatment, hose the      soft-bodied pests off your plants. Immature ladybugs (you      can buy them by mail) gorge on aphids. According to Doc      Abraham, daddy longleg spiders eat aphids and other insect      larvae.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Spider mites</strong> bother plants, such as      ornamentals, that are shifted from house to greenhouse.      Infested plants may have mottled foliage and a skimpy,      delicate webbing among their leaves. Since the mites like a      hot, dry climate, your best defense is to mist and      ventilate the greenhouse. During severe infestations, try      swabbing the leaves (undersides, too) with a half-and-half      mixture of water and rubbing alcohol. Test it first,      though, to be sure it won't harm your plants. To help      prevent the problem, be sure to supply your soil with      calcium (limestone or crushed eggshells will do the trick).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pillbugs</strong> are among the most annoying      uninvited residents. These small, grey, oval, many-legged,      segmented crustaceans-which roll into a ball when      disturbed-feed on plant debris and hide under boards      and in crevices . . . to emerge when you're not looking and      feed on roots and young seedlings. To prevent infestation,      remove fallen leaves, plant flats, and other hiding places      from the surface of the growing bed. I've also trapped      pillbugs under potato pieces, apple peelings, and      grapefruit and cantaloupe rinds.    </p>    <p>      Handpicking even a few pillbugs on a daily basis helps      lower their numbers. I have no illusion that my greenhouse      will ever be free of them (and they do help break down      plant debris); I'll be satisfied if I can just keep them      from destroying my seedlings. I often protect valuable new      seedlings-like greenhouse cucumbers-by dusting      around them with diatomaceous earth.    </p>    <p>      While pillbugs nibble on seedlings and young plants,      another invader takes leaf pieces from older plants as      well. If you spot such evidence-and a telltale trail      of dried mucus-take a midnight safari into your      greenhouse with a flashlight. I bet you'll find      <strong>slugs,</strong> happy in all that damp lushness.    </p>    <p>      You can trap slugs as you do pillbugs, and also spread wood      ashes or diatomaceous earth to irritate their soft bodies.      But I just visit the greenhouse several hours after first      dark, armed with a thick glove, a can, and a flashlight. If      I handpick the slugs for 7 to 10 days, their numbers drop      steadily. (My biggest haul was 50 in one raid!)    </p>
