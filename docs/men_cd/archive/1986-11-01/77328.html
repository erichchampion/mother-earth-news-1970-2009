                    <h5 id="byline">      by Greg and Pat Williams    </h5>    <h3>      Research Briefs    </h3>        <p><strong>      Suffering succulents!</strong>If your indoor cacti and other      succulents suffered from neglect during the gardening      season, now's the time to make amends. British expert Roy      Mottram says that although people associate succulents with      harsh alkaline soils, their soil pH should be slightly      acidic-ideally, 5.5. So check your tap water for alkalinity      if your plants seem unhealthy. Mottram also recommends      giving succulents weak doses (1:1:2) of N-P-K fertilizer      and adding organic matter or sterile soil for trace      elements.    </p>    <p>      Succulents can tolerate fairly high levels of soluble      salts-if the pH isn't too highbut extreme salinity kills      roots. So water occasionally but thoroughly to wash out      accumulated salts, and repot any plants that seem to be      either waterlogged or difficult to wet; they're most likely      full. of salts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Control greenhouse whiteflies.</strong> Yellow      sticky boards control greenhouse whiteflies <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: See "Getting the Most From Your Solar Greenhouse" on      page 74],</em> but according to Japanese horticulturists,      their effective range is only one yard. So space them no      farther than three feet from plants and from each other.      Their efficiency also drops sharply when daily highs are      under 80Â°F.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Beware metallic blight!</strong> Some landscapers      and homeowners don't remove the soilballing wire mesh from      trees and shrubs when transplanting, because they think the      wire will break down quickly in the soil. Not so! Dr. James      Feucht of the Colorado Extension Service found that mesh      buried for <em>15 years</em> can restrict root growth and      even kill formerly healthy plantsespecially during a      drought. (The size of the mesh openings doesn't matter.)      The moral? Remove wire from root balls when planting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>More on controlling soil disease.</strong> In our      May/June column, we reported on soil amendments developed      in Taiwan to control soil-borne disease. Plant pathologists      in Hawaii now claim they controlled damping off of cucumber      seedlings (caused by the <em>Pythium splendens</em> fungus)      by adding 0.6 % calcium and 1 % alfalfa meal, by weight, to      infested soil. (Calcium carbonate, hydroxide, and sulfate      were all used-the last does not increase pH.) Perhaps      a bit of calcium and organic matter can provide good      insurance against <em>many</em> soil-borne plant diseases.    </p>        <p><strong>      Soaking troubles?</strong>Many gardeners pre soak some crop seeds      (such as okra) to speed germination. But USDA plant      physiologist Stephen Spaeth says presoaking can create      lifelong problems for crops. An unsoaked seed remains      essentially intact until its root tip pokes out, but a      soaked one takes up water so quickly it cracks. Sugars,      proteins, and amino acids can then leak out into      surrounding soil and nourish pathogenic fungi-which      infect the seed. The fungi may stress plants their entire      lives. Spaeth also considers leakage a problem for seeds      germinating in very wet soil-such as farm grains and      legumes planted just before heavy spring rains.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pesticide facts.</strong> Cornell professor David      Pimental and graduate student Lois Levitan recently noted      in <em>BioScience</em> that the U.S. uses about a      <em>billion</em> pounds of pesticides a year (120 million      pounds in and around homes). About 16 % of the country's      land area is treated yearly, with an average of three      pounds of pesticide per acre (12 pounds near household      areas!). Environmental and social costs of pesticide use      amount to about $1 billion yearly (direct costs are about      $3 billion), while pest control benefits are worth roughly      $12 billion.    </p>        <p>      Sadly, less than 1 % of applied pesticides typically affect      their target populations. Improved application      technology-even just spraying close to      crops-could reduce pesticide use considerably      <em>without</em> decreasing effectiveness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Easy on the N, please.</strong> Egyptian      researchers found that fertilizing spinach heavily with      soluble nitrogen increases the plants' content of poisonous      oxalic acid and active oxalates. Winter-produced and young      spinach also had generally higher oxalic acid levels than      spring and mature plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Don't prune.</strong> Just what we like: a plant      that yields more fruit when it <em>isn't</em> pruned. New      Zealand trials with Magnus black currants showed that      unpruned currants bore nearly twice as heavily as pruned      ones.    </p>    <h3>      Gleanings    </h3>    <p>      The booklet "Marketing for the Small Farmer: Direct      Marketing and Quality Control" covers vegetable harvesting,      packaging, and handling and is available free from The      Small Farm Center, University of California, Davis, CA      95616 . . . . The U.S. Forest Service guidebook "Managing      Urban Woodlands for a Variety of Birds" provides details on      creating bird habitats in parks and suburban backyards      throughout the East. Write for a free copy of Bulletin      NE-INF-6385 from Information Services, Northeastern Forest      Experiment Station, 370 Reed Rd., Broomall, PA 19008 . . .      . Finally, the USDA has set up an Alternative Farming      Systems Information Center (National Agricultural Library,      Room 111, Beltsville, MD 20705; 301/344-3704) to provide      access to publications that emphasize low-input,      resource-conserving farming and gardening .... The summer      '86 issue of <em>Growers' Review Quarterly</em> ($3      postpaid from Florists' Review Publishing Co., Suite 545,      111 N. Canal St., Chicago, IL 60606) includes a      well-illustrated article on using a homemade conduit bender      to make inexpensive hoop-framed greenhouses. Author John      Senne built eight 80" X 50' greenhouses for his flower      business from standard 10' conduit .... The herbal insect,      slug, and snail repellent "Green Ban"-recently      imported from Australia -contains eucalyptus oil,      Norwegian kelp, sage, garlic, and English ivy. Preliminary      tests show it particularly useful against aphids. Order an      eight-ounce bottle for $8.25 postpaid from Smith &      Hawken (25 Corte Madera, Mill Valley, CA 94941) . . . .      Send $1 to Lesco, Inc. (Grass Seed Issue, P.O. Box 16915,      Rocky River, OH 44116) for a quite useful booklet on      turfgrass and wildflower seed.    </p>    <p>      Greg and Pat Williams raise most of their own food on a      small farm and publish HortIdeas, a fine newsletter on      gardening research and products (available for $10 a year      from G. & P. Williams, Rt. 1, Box 302, Gravel Switch,      KY 40328).    </p>
