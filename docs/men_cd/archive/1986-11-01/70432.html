            <p>      Easy to erect, space efficient, and a joy to behold. Is      this the ultimate woodpile?    </p>                                            <p>      "Every man," wrote Thoreau, "looks at his woodpile with a      kind of affection." Well, maybe so, but some woodpiles      merit more fondness than others. There are those that are      <em>piles</em> of logs dumped on the ground like pick-up      sticks, and then there are those that approach the level of      art.    </p>    <p>      Witness the <em>holzhaufen,</em> a traditional German      firewood-curing stack. Able to hold as much as two and a      half cords in a six-foot-diameter space, the conelike      structure is a marriage of form and function-a marvel      to look at and a model of efficient design. And though the      structure <em>looks</em> elaborate, building one generally      takes only a little more time than making a conventional      stack. North Carolinian Don Jennings and his son, featured      in the photos, finished the nine-foot-tall, twocord      holzhaufen you see here in about two hours.    </p>    <p>      There are several essentials for a holzhaufen: split wood      12 to 24 inches long (the pieces needn't be precisely the      same length, but uniformity helps) . . . a supply of      smaller, kindling-size splits . . . and a sunny,      <em>level</em> site. If the ground isn't level, the pile      could tip, so choose your spot carefully. You'll need from      four to six feet of circular space; the shorter the wood,      the smaller you should make the holzhaufen's diameter      (Don's is six feet across). You'll also need a straight      pole (Mr. Jennings uses a sectional aluminum tent pole) the      same height or higher than the pile you intend to      build-a ten-foot stack, which can contain from two to      two and a half cords, is considered maximum, while four      feet is as low as you should go. (Remember, though, that      this is a <em>curing</em> stack; if you want your dried      wood to be easily accessible, and don't want to      <em>restack</em> it, don't build a holzhaufen that's higher      than you can reach.) Last, get a lightweight board, cut it      as long as the pile's intended diameter, and drill a hole      in its center just big enough to slide the pole through.    </p>    <p>      You're ready to start. Place the board on the ground, with      the hole at the site's center, and stick the pole through      it and firmly into the earth. The pole must be plumb to      keep the pile vertical, so check it with a carpenter's      level. Now slide the board up the pole and, using the ends      of the board to indicate what will be the pile's      circumference, lay a circle of end-to-end log splits just      <em>inside</em> that circumference.    </p>    <p>      Once the holzhaufen's foundation is in place, lay the first      course of logs. Again, slide the board up the pole and use      it as a guide; as you position each log, make sure its      outer end is precisely even with a board end, to maintain      the pile's diameter. It's important, too, to resist the      tendency to lay the logs parallel to one another; although      they should be placed as close together as possible, they      must extend <em>radially</em> from the center outward, like      the spokes of a wheel.    </p>    <p>      When the first course is complete, it should have a slight      inward pitch all around, with the inner ends of the logs      about two inches lower than the outer. The course should      also be approximately level around the outer few inches of      the logs. Move the foundation logs in or out as necessary      to achieve a consistent pitch and height. Check the ends of      the radial logs once more with the board to be sure the      diameter is still the way you want it. As you move the slat      on its axis to check each log, use it to help you eyeball      the course's perimeter. At any given point, the board      should look reasonably level from tip to tip-from the      outer edge of one side to the outer edge of the opposite      side.    </p>    <p>      Next, lay a supporting circle of kindling splits across the      radial logs a few inches in from the outer ends. The      purpose of these stringers is to help maintain the logs'      inward pitch and level perimeter, and to bridge any      unavoidable gaps in the first course.    </p>    <p>      Now lay the second and subsequent courses just as you did      the first, placing a round of stringers on top of each      course. <em>Check every log with the guide board</em> to be      sure the radial configuration, desired diameter, and level      perimeter are maintained. Too much or too little inward      slope will cause problems, too.    </p>    <p>      When the pile gets to be two or three feet high, fill the      hollow core with logs placed on end. Pack them tightly, but      not so snug that they put pressure on the outer wall. Now      continue building the pile, filling the core whenever it's      convenient.    </p>    <p>      When you get within two or three feet of the holzhaufen's      intended top, stop using splits between the courses and      stack each circle of logs just a bit closer to the pole      than the one before. This will reduce the pile's      circumference and gradually reverse the logs' pitch until      they meet and rise upward in the middle, creating a      cone-shaped top. "Shingle" the roof with logs placed bark      side up to shed rain and snow, and there you have it: a      genuine holzhaufen!    </p>    <h3>      MOM'S WOODPILE CONTEST    </h3>        <p>      Now's the time of year when most woodpiles are at their      biggest and best. How does yours stack up against the rest?      You're invited to find out by entering MOM's first-ever      Great Woodpile Contest. Just send us one or more good,      sharp photos (35 mm color only) of your cordwood cache,      along with a note including your name, address, and phone      number. Tell us about your woodpile, too-its size,      construction, etc.    </p>    <p>      We'll award cash prizes to the top three entries-$100      for first place, $50 for second, and $25 for third.    </p>    <p>      There are only a few qualifying rules: The woodpile must be      currently standing, and you must have built it on your own      homeplace. Entries must be postmarked before December 31,      1986. (Sorry, we can't return entries.) Decision of the      judges is final.    </p>    <p>      Send entries to Great Woodpile Contest, <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>,      P.O.
