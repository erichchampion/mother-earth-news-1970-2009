    <p>
                        <p>      Cabbage <em>(Brassica oleracea capitata)</em> is a member      of the cole family, as are cauliflower, Brussels sprouts,      kale kohlrabi, and collards. A related plant grows wild      along the coasts of western and southern Europe, and it was      probably from this "sea cabbage" that our garden varieties      originally developed. People have eaten cabbage for more      than 4,000 years,and several different types were already      being cultivated by the height of the Roman Empire. Cabbage      can be grown throughout the continental U.S., but late      varieties must be chosen in the South.    </p>    <h3>      What to Plant    </h3>    <p>      Today's gardeners can chose from hundreds of early-,      midseason-, and late-maturing varieties. Among the early      cabbages are Copenhagen Market, Golden Acre, Early Dark      Green Savoy, Early Jersey Wakefield, Marion Market, Emerald      Cross Hybrid, Stonehead Hybrid, and Dwarf Morden. (This      last is a miniature Canadian cabbage that is only 4" across      and matures in 55 days.) Autumn Marvel, Penn, Red Acre and      Savoy King are midseason and midseason-late varieties,      while late cabbages, like Penn State Ballhead and Wisconsin      Hollander, provide an autumn or-in mild      climates-even a winter harvest. Because cabbage takes      from 60 to more than 180 days to mature, only early types      are suited to regions of the country with very short      growing seasons.    </p>    <p>      Of course, there are other ways to classify cabbages.      Leaves, for example, can be smooth or crinkled (A      crinkled-leafed Savoy c ontains more iron than other      cabbages.) Shades vary from reddish purple (Red Acre, Ruby      Ball, and Mammoth Red Rock, for example) to light green,      and stems can be almost nonexistent to 20" long. Some, such      as the Wakefield varieties, have conical heads, while      others produce hearts that are round or flat. There are      ornamental cabbages, too, having loose, flowering heads      with ruffled centers of red, white, or pink and outside      borders of green leaves. Gardeners grow them for their      beauty alone in containers on patios or even indoors in a      sunny location. However, besides being showy autumn plants,      they're quite edible and make a colorful addition to      salads.    </p>    <p>      There are other considerations when selecting the type of      cabbage to grow. For instance, a Wakefield, as well as most      purple cabbages, keeps better than, say, the Savoy types,      which are best eaten right from the garden. (And your first      taste of garden-fresh cabbage will convince you of the      value of growing your own! Store-bought versions are      usually harvested weeks, if not months, before they're      marketed.) If you want a good winter cabbage that's      flavorful cooked or raw, consider the tight-headed white      cabbages and such varieties as Celtic Cross F1. Should      diseases be a problem in your area, Golden Acre, Marion      Market, Stonehead Hybrid, and Early Jersey Wakefield are      among the more disease-resistant types. In regions with      long hot spells, a heat-resistant cabbage, such as Savoy      King, is a good selection.    </p>    <h3>      When to Plant    </h3>    <p>      Cabbages are easy to start from seed. Sow early varieties      indoors, 1/4" deep and 2" apart, about four to six weeks      (usually mid-January or February in the South and March in      the North) before time to set them out in the garden. Place      the flats in a greenhouse, on a sunny windowsill, or under      fluorescent lights. (Unused seeds should keep for four or      five years with germination rates of around 75%.)    </p>    <p>      Keep the soil uniformly moist and at 60° to 70°F.      (Large, clear plastic bags slipped over the flats can help      maintain moisture and temperature levels, but if the      seedlings start to turn pale green or sickly, you can      assume that they're too warm.) Once three leaves have      formed, the seedlings will be ready to be hardened of in a      cold frame or exposed to outdoor conditions (50° to      55° F) for a week or so before they're set in their      permanent spot. Just remember: While cabbage seedlings need      all the sunshine they can get, daytime temperatures should      be on the cool side, and-during hardening      off-the tender plants should be brought in at night.    </p>    <p>      If you're using a cold frame, open it when the temperature      inside exceeds 65°F, and close it at sundown. Keep the      soil moderately moist, and don't fertilize in the      germinating or hardening-off stages; your young cabbages      might produce tall, skinny stems and may flower rather than      form heads.    </p>    <p>      Once the plants are well hardened, they can be set out in      the garden, even though nighttime temperatures drop below      freezing for several days. Stagger your plantings at      regular intervals in order to harvest throughout the      summer.    </p>    <p>      With midseason or late types, seeds can be sown in outdoor      flats instead of under glass or lights. Otherwise, the      growing procedure is the same. Midseason varieties can be      sown after the last frost. Late types should be started      around the first to the middle of July to be transplanted      to the garden by the first or middle of August (no later      than August 1 in the North).    </p>    <h3>      How to Plan    </h3>    <p>      Pick a sunny, well-drained location for your cabbage patch.      Early varieties do best in a sandy loam, while later types      like a heavier soil that will retain moisture. Since this      vegetable is a heavy feeder, plow under 3" or more of      well-rotted manure or compost at least two weeks before you      set out the young plants. Add greensand for potassium, and      phosphate rock for phosphorus. Cabbage also dislikes acid      soil, preferring a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Even with ideal      pH, raking a heavy dusting of ground limestone into the      plowed earth is a good idea, particularly when club root is      a potential problem.    </p>    <p>      Ample moisture is even more important than perfect soil, so      mulch your plants well to retain water and to keep down      weeds. (To avoid hoe damage to the vegetable's shallow      roots, hand-pull any competition that appears.) Overhead      watering during periods of high humidity or cool weather      can cause diseases if the dense leaves don't get a chance      to dry out, and soggy mulch adjacent to the plants may      cause the heads to split.    </p>    <p>      Cabbage can be planted between, or <em>in</em> , rows of      early lettuce and radishes, since these crops will be      harvested before the cabbage needs the space they occupy.      You can follow a cabbage crop with beets, beans, or late      corn, while late cabbage can be planted in the same rows      from which you've harvested peas or carrots.    </p>    <p>      Since pinching the stem of a baby cabbage can cause      permanent damage, handle the transplants gently. Set them      out in 1/2"- to 1"-deep holes that are wide enough to      accommodate a fully spread rootball, then apply enough      water to insure contact between the rootlets and the soil.      Space the seedlings 6" to 12" apart in rows 12" to 25"      apart. (The wider the spacing, the larger the cabbages can      grow, but younger, smaller ones are tastier. If you use 6"      spacing, you can harvest every other one before maturity. A      100' row of 70 early cabbage plants will yield about 100      pounds; 60 late types in the same space, about 175 pounds.)      Firm the soil well around the seedlings, and side-dress      them with well-rotted manure three weeks after      transplanting. If the leaves start to yellow, your plants      probably need a midseason nitrogen boost. Otherwise, cut      back on watering and fertilizing as the plants mature, to      prevent the heads from splitting.    </p>    <h3>      What to Watch For    </h3>    <p>      Cabbage, like all members of the cole family, has some      traditional enemies, includ ing caterpillars, cutworms,      flea beetles, aphids, harlequin bugs, black rot, root knot,      yellows, club root, and blackleg. However, these pests and      diseases will seldom cause you to lose a healthy,      well-weeded crop. Your best lines of defense are to provide      good growing conditions, rotate cole crops to different      areas of the garden, and use disease-resistant varieties.    </p>    <p>      Cabbage maggots (white, legless, and 1/3" long) are the      offspring of cabbage-root flies. They attack the stems,      causing the plants to wilt in hot weather. Gently pull the      dirt away from such plants, and if you see an infestation,      put a heaping tablespoon of wood ashes around each stem,      firm up the soil, and water well. Maggots can also be      controlled by the prompt removal of the eggs, which look      like small grains of white rice. If a plant dies, pull it      up and burn it: You certainly want to keep the problem from      spreading.    </p>    <p>      Cabbage butterflies have white or yellow wings marked with      three or four black spots and tipped with gray. They lay      eggs at the base of cabbage plants, and a week later,      caterpillars hatch out to eat big, ragged holes in the      foliage, leaving behind bits of green excrement. Inspect      the plants and pick off both the eggs and caterpillars, or,      later in the season, they will bore into the young cabbage      heads. You can discourage the butterflies by surrounding      your cabbage bed with tomatoes, garlic, onions, tansy,      sage, rosemary, nasturtiums, catnip, or hyssop.      Caterpillars can also be killed with a dusting of salt and      flour, which causes them to bloat and die. Some gardeners      say sour milk spooned into the cabbage heads is sufficient      to get rid of worms, while others use a spray of ground      mint, onion, garlic, and hot peppers in a little soap and      water.    </p>    <p>      If you're invaded by cabbage loopers (a pale green worm) or      harlequin bugs (a southern pest), biological controls      include importing a supply of trichogramma wasps, which are      parasites, and spraying the crop with <em>Bacillus      thuringiensis,</em> a powdered bacterium. Handpicking is      slower, but also effective.    </p>    <p>      Small holes in the leaves are probably caused by flea      beetles, which can be discouraged by watering well each      evening. Whiteflies and aphids cause unsightly trails of      droppings on the leaves, but cabbage can usually survive      such pests. If the attack is noticed early, spraying the      insects with soapy water should keep them under control.    </p>    <h3>      How to Harvest and Store    </h3>    <p>      When cabbage heads become firm to the touch, you can start      to harvest them. Splitting, if not caused by irregular      watering, 1986 means the heads are past their prime. If you      want to hold a mature cabbage in the ground a little      longer, a slight twist of the head will break some of the      feeder roots and keep the plant from bolting or splitting.    </p>    <p>      To harvest, cut the heads off the root system with a sharp      knife. Discard the inferior outer leaves and inspect for      insects. If you leave the stalks and roots in place,      they'll produce tasty little sprouts that can be eaten like      Brussels sprouts or, when left alone, will develop into a      second crop of small heads.    </p>    <p>      Cabbage tastes best when eaten soon after harvesting, but      late-season varieties, in particular, will keep well in a      moist, cool (32° to 40°F) location for five to six      months. Late cabbages can be left in the ground all winter      in mild climates, or they can be pulled up by the roots,      heeled-in upside down in a well-drained trench, and covered      with a foot of leaves or hay. Another storage method is to      wrap the individual heads in waxed paper and place them in      the coolest part of an attic or basement. You can salvage      split heads by quickly turning them into sauerkraut.    </p>    <h3>      Tasty Cabbage Recipes    </h3>    <p>      "Isn't there anything to do with cabbage," people have been      known to ask, "besides making sauerkraut and cole slaw?"      There certainly is, and a quick look through cookbooks will      soon turn up any number of wonderful ways to prepare this      versatile, low-calorie vegetable, which is rich in vitamin      C and contains good amounts of vitamins B1, B2, and A,      along with calcium, phosphorus, and iron. It can be baked,      steamed, boiled, and stir-fried, and enjoyed in salads,      soups, and stews, though cooking, of course, destroys some      of the nutrients. (If you notice a strong odor when cooking      cabbage, you may be using too high a heat or too much      water. Some people claim that half a walnut dropped in the      water will eliminate the odor problem.) Here are just a few      MOTHER-tested dishes we think you'll enjoy.    </p>    <h3>      Cabbage and Rice Soup    </h3>    <p>      3 tablespoons margarine<br />      1 pound shredded cabbage<br />      1 cup thinly sliced onions<br />      6 cups homemade chicken broth<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      1/8 teaspoon pepper<br />      1/8 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      1/2 cup rice<br />      1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese    </p>    <p>      Melt margarine in a 4-quart kettle. Rinse cabbage and add      to margarine along with onions. Cook over medium heat for      about 10 minutes. Add broth, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.      Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Add rice and cook 20      minutes or until rice is tender. Ladle into bowls and      garnish with cheese. Serves 8.    </p>    <p>      Per serving: 300 cal., 13 g pro., 8 g carbo., 15 g fat, 751      mg sodium. U.S. RDA: 14% vit. A, 23% vit. C, 40% calcium.    </p>    <h3>      Greek Stuffed Cabbage    </h3>    <p>      1 large head green cabbage<br />      1 recipe for stuffing (see below)<br />      1/2 cup olive oil<br />      1 8-ounce can tomato sauce<br />      1 bay leaf, crushed<br />      2 cups beef boullion    </p>    <h3>      Stuffing    </h3>    <p>      1/2 pound ground beef<br />      1/2 pound ground lamb<br />      1 egg<br />      1 medium onion, chopped<br />      1/2 teaspoon oregano<br />      1/2 teaspoon mint<br />      1/4 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)<br />      Salt and pepper to taste<br />      3/4 cup raw white rice<br />      2 tablespoons tomato sauce<br />      3 tablespoons olive oil<br />      1/2 cup dry white wine    </p>    <p>      Core cabbage and separate leaves. Parboil leaves in salted      water for 5 minutes. Combine all stuffing ingredients and      mix well. Place stuffing in individual cabbage leaves. Fold      two opposite sides of each leaf inward and roll, starting      at the short end. Place rolls in layers in large pot.      Sprinkle each layer with olive oil, tomato sauce, and bay      leaf. Add bouillon to the pot, adding enough water to cover      the rolls. Cover and simmer over low heat for one hour.      Serves 6 to 8.    </p>    <p>      <em>Per serving:</em> 382 cal., 12 g pro., 11 g carbo., 32      g fat, 23 mg sodium. U.S. RDA: 38% vit. C.    </p>    <h3>      TO MAKE SAUERKRAUT    </h3>        <p>      Quarter and shread firm heads and put a <em>4"</em> layer      of cabbage in a sterilized wood or crockery container. Add      a layer of pickling salt (which has no chemical additives      to affect taste or color) and pound the two together with a      wooden mallet or clean baseball bat (avoid metal utensils).      This releases the cabbage juices and the natural bacteria      and initiates the fermentation process.    </p>    <p>      Keep adding layers of cabbage and salt and tamp each      thoroughly. A five-gallon crock will hold 40 pounds of      cabbage and will require 1 pound of salt. Fill the      container to within 3" or 4" of the top, and place a      plate-weighted down with a rock-on the kraut to      make sure it is completely covered with brine. Otherwise,      it will rot. Cover the crock with a clean cloth.    </p>    <p>      Sauerkraut can be cured in either a warm or cool      environment. The first, a fast process, tends to produce a      "sweet" kraut, and the second, which slows fermentation,      makes a "tart" product. It's important to check the      container every other day during the preservation process,      washing the plate and the rock and skimming off any mold or      scum that forms. When the mixture quits bubbling, it's      ready to eat, can, or store in a cool place for winter      enjoyment.    </p>
