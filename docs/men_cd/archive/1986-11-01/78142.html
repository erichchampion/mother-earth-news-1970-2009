                    <p>      A solar greenhouse is different from a sunspace. One is      designed to suit the needs of plants, the other those of      people. A solar greenhouse is a pleasant place to visit,      and it helps heat the house it's connected to, but these      aren't its primary purposes.    </p>    <p>      The guidelines that follow are for the design of a solar      greenhouse where light, not heat, is the limiting factor      for plant growth. A greenhouse built to these parameters      will require a small amount of back-up heat to maintain      optimum growing conditions. Still, it will provide more      energy to the house on an annual basis than it will require      for occasional auxiliary heating.    </p>    <p>      (For a thorough discussion of design considerations for      various types of greenhouses and sunspaces and a complete      explanation of building methods, see <em>The Homeowner's      Complete Handbook for Add-On Solar Greenhouses and      Sunspaces,</em> by Andrew M. Shapiro, Rodale Press, 1985;      $19.95.)    </p>
