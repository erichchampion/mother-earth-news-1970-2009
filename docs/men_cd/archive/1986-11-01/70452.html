                    <p>      <em>If you'd like our panel of consultants to answer a      question concerning some aspect of self-reliant living that      has you stumped, send it to Ask Our Experts, MOTHER EARTH      NEWS, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, NC 28793. The most      frequently asked questions will be answered here-and      here only-so that we can all benefit from what these      folks have to say.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Sandy Well Water    </h3>        <p>      <em>We recently put in a well on our land, and we're      getting a lot of sand in our water. Our neighbors say this      is a common problem. What can be done to prevent the grit      from getting into our plumbing?</em>    </p>    <p>      I'm missing some important details about your location and      situation, so I will offer several suggestions that cover      some possible solutions.    </p>    <p>      Schedule a face-to-face meeting with your well driller to      discuss the problem and possible remedies. The key topics      will depend strongly on the hydrogeological details of your      property. For example, if your well is so deep that it      penetrates a bedrock aquifer (either a water table aquifer      or a confined aquifer), then it would be a rare condition      for the water itself to contain sand and would indicate      that the well casing is not properly sealed at the top of      the bedrock. The driller may be able to seal the casing      properly.    </p>    <p>      If your well is fairly shallow, so that it penetrates only      the overburden (soil, sand, and gravel) forming a water      table aquifer, then the driller may have selected slots of      an incorrect size for the slotted portion of the well      casing. In certain situations, the driller may be able to      install new casing with the proper slots, although this is      sometimes too difficult or costly.    </p>    <p>      If one of the preceding methods can't be used, then explore      the possibility of wrapping the pump intake with a      nylonbased "geotechnical" fabric often used by civil      engineers in the field. The desirability of this option      depends on whether the inside diameter of your well casing      and the outside diameter of your pump intake will allow a      physical fit. It also depends on the prevalence of the      sand, the fineness of the sand, and the mesh of the nylon      fabric used as a filter on the pump intake. If you select      the right combination, you may not have to check or change      this filter fabric more than once a year. (On the other      hand, you may have to do so much more often.)    </p>    <p>      If none of the above will work in your situation, you may      be able to install either an in-line holding tank (possibly      pressurized to supply the water pressure in your home)      which will allow the sand to settle for periodic removal      and/or some kind of in-line canister filter. Such      basement-located units will require maintenance to remove      the collected sand.    </p>    <p>      You do want to remove the sand from the cold water supply      before it reaches any hot water tanks, household      appliances, motors, extra pumps, or valve seats-and      especially before the water goes to a septic tank and      leaching field for disposal.    </p>    <p>      Finally, you might want to contact several local plumbers      and contractors to discuss these ideas with them and to      find out how your neighbors cope with this problem.-      <em>David</em> <em>Burmaster</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>David Burmaster, Ph.D., is a consultant on surface- and      groundwater quality and hazardous-waste management. He is      the author of many articles and reports on these      topics.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Safe Canned Food    </h3>    <p>      How long can canned food be kept and still be absolutely      safe to eat?    </p>    <p>      If properly processed and sealed, canned food will remain      safe for many years (though I wouldn't make use of the jars      abandoned in Grandma's cellar). If it <em>hasn't</em> been      properly processed and sealed, it will have spoiled. Here      are some typical signs to look for:    </p>    <p>      <em>Unopened containers:</em> cans that seep or bulge;      leaky seals; moldy seals or food; cloudy or yeasty liquid;      food that's shriveled, spongy-looking, or unnaturally      colored (often dark).    </p>    <p>      <em>Opened containers:</em> spurts when opened;      fermentation; soft or slimy food; unpleasant odor; moldy      lid.    </p>    <p>      But, even though older canned goods may be safe to eat,      most will undergo some deterioration in nutrition or      quality (color, texture, flavor) after about one year. I've      personally had fruits, sauerkraut, and beans darken and      soften. My tomatoes, pickles, and jellies have held up      better, though they may have lost nutrients.    </p>    <p>      Storage in a cool, dark, dry place will prolong the time      canned food will retain its optimal condition.    </p>    <p>      - <em>Susan Ervin</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Susan Ervin is a long-time organic gardener and former      agricultural researcher at the New. Alchemy Institute. She      is now working on her own land in Western North      Carolina.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Chain Saw Fuel Problems    </h3>    <p>      <em>The gas-tank lining is coming off my Jonsereds 601      chain saw and clogging the fuel filter. The saw has been      sitting in storage for some time with gasoline in the tank,      but it's in good shape otherwise. Is there a solvent that      will remove the deteriorating lining completely?</em>    </p>    <p>      A strong solvent, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone      (MEK), or toluene, should dissolve what's left of the      protective epoxy lining within the alloy tank-but I'd      suggest removing the fuel pickup tube and its filter before      introducing such solvents into the tank. To assure a      thorough clean-out job, place a few flat washers into the      halffilled tank, cap it, and shake the saw vigorously to      rattle the washers. Empty the tank, rinse it out with      kerosene, and replace the fuel pickup assembly after      cleaning it in parts solvent to remove gasoline varnish.    </p>    <p>      The lining may have originally been dissolved by methyl      alcohol in a gasohol blend-so, if you use gasohol,      make sure it's a 10% <em>ethanol</em> product, which is      easier on the saw's nonmetal parts.    </p>    <p>      - <em>Richard Freudenberger</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Richard Freudenberger is MOTHER's research      coordinator.</em>    </p>
