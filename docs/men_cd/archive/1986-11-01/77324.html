                    <h3>      Solar Polar Bears    </h3>    <p>      The polar bear is a nearly perfect solar converter, says      electrical engineer Richard Grojean of Boston's      Northeastern University. The bear's fur appears white      because it reflects visible light, but in fact polar bear      hairs are transparent and hollow. They trap ultraviolet      radiation and conduct it, like light within an optical      fiber, to the bear's skin-which is black. The energy      is then absorbed and helps maintain the animal's body      temperature. Unlike solar collectors that must be aimed for      maximum gain, polar bear hairs trap light coming from any      direction. And the animals lose very little heat; the      ultraviolet energy flows only in one direction: toward the      animal's skin, never away from it. Grojean believes that      similar principles can be applied to designing efficient      solar collectors for use in cold climates.    </p>    <h3>      Wild Mushroom Cloud    </h3>        <p>      Much to the dismay of mycologists and wild-foods foragers,      the demand among gourmets for wild mushrooms is bringing      more and more full-time pickers from U.S. and foreign food      companies into the fungusrich forests of the Northwest.      According to a biologist with the Washington Department of      Natural Resources, the annual harvest from that state alone      is now no less than 1 million pounds. Although no studies      have been conducted, some scientists fear that      overharvesting, combined with the destructive impact of      heavy foot traffic on the forest floor, may endanger some      mushroom species. Also threatened are the trees that have a      symbiotic relationship with mushrooms, drawing nutrients      from the fungi that grow on and in their roots, trunks, and      limbs.    </p>    <h3>      En-gendering Failure    </h3>    <p>      Agricultural training programs designed to help the people      of African nations learn better ways to feed themselves may      be doomed . . . simply because many of the programs are      training males to do work for which, by cultural tradition,      females are responsible. According to the International      Children's Centre, African women do the vast majority of      agricultural tasks: 50% of the planting, 70 % of the hoeing      and weeding, 60 % of the harvesting, 80% of the storing, 90      % of the processing, 60 % of the marketing, and half of the      chores involved in managing livestock. Yet only 10 % to 20      % of the participants in agricultural training programs are      women, leaving the likelihood that much of the instruction      will be wasted on male students who will never use their      training.    </p>    <h3>      Undercover Crops    </h3>    <p>      Orchards with cover crops, or even weeds, growing between      trees suffer less damage from harmful insects than "clean"      orchards, say researchers at the University of California's      Division of Biological Control. The scientists planted bell      beans, vetch, rye, clover, or mixed weeds in some test      orchards and disc-cultivated others. The cover-cropped      groves had fewer aphids, leafhoppers, and codling moths,      and had higher and more diverse populations of predatory      species. Apparently the vegetation initially draws pest      insects, providing them with food and shelter-but      they in turn attract predators that devour the harmful      types before significant numbers infest the trees. Some      cover crops-particularly long-blooming      legumes-seemed to foster especially high populations      of beneficial insects.    </p>    <h3>      Air Bag Pollution    </h3>    <p>      In a crash, the front seat occupants of a car equipped with      an air bag have a good chance of escaping severe injury.      When the wrecked car is towed to a junkyard for recycling,      however, the bag itself becomes a potential killer. Such      cushions contain an explosive chemical propellant, sodium      azide, which is a suspected carcinogen and mutagen. Listed      as dangerous under the federal Toxic Substances Control      Act, sodium azide is released if an air bagequipped auto is      fed into a shredder (as most junked cars now are).      Recyclers say that finding a way to deal with air bags is      the toughest problem they face. Currently, they claim, the      propellant-and therefore the air bag in      general- endangers the lives of thousands of workers      in the industry and may lead to air, soil, and groundwater      contamination in areas near shredding facilities.    </p>    <h3>      Mulch Ado About Nothing    </h3>    <p>      According to the USDA, an estimated 285 million pounds of      petroleum-based plastic film are produced each year for      agriculture, and about half are used for mulch. But because      plastic mulch isn't biodegradable, it adds nothing to the      soil and must be routinely removed and disposed of at the      end of the season, an expensive and time-consuming process      that often creates environmental problems when the film is      burned or buried. Now scientists are developing a      starch-based film, made from surplus corn, that will      decompose naturally after a set period: say, the length of      a typical growing season. Although the film is still      several years away from commercial production, USDA      scientists believe it could eventually replace conventional      plastic mulches made from petroleum-derived chemicals.    </p>    <h3>      Cattle and Sheep Together    </h3>        <p>      Cattle, not poisons or fences, may offer western sheep      farmers the best way to protect their flocks from coyotes.      Cows and sheep grazing on the same range normally keep      their distance. But USDA researchers have found that when      45-day-old lambs and yearling heifers are penned together      for 30 days, the lambs form a strong social bond with the      cows and develop a need to be close to them. When turned      out to graze, the two species intermingle freely . . . a      fortunate arrangement for the mild-mannered sheep, because      cows distrust coyotes and unfamiliar dogs, and butt and      kick at the predators to keep them away. (Incidentally,      cattle eat mainly grasses, while sheep prefer broadleaved      plants, so the two can coexist on varied pasture nicely.      The infamous and bloody range wars of the Old      West-cattle ranchers against sheep farmers-were      totally unnecessary.)    </p>    <h3>      Adopt a Whale    </h3>    <p>      Researchers have found that the tail fins, or flukes, of      humpback whales-an endangered species-are as      different and distinctive as human fingerprints. As a      result, sci entists have been able to identify more than      350 individual humpbacks. In subsequent studies, they've      found that each whale has a unique personality. Using that      information, the International Wildlife Coalition has come      up with an appealing method for raising funds to help save      the whales. For $15 or more, you can "adopt" a specific      humpback and receive a photo of that whale, along with an      "adoption certificate." You also get a subscription to the      coalition's quarterly publication, <em>Whalewatch,</em>      which includes updates not only on important conservation      issues but also on sightings of individual whales. For      additional information, a list of eminently adoptable      whales, and an application form, write to Whale Adoption      Project, International Wildlife Coalition, 320 Gifford St.,      Falmouth, MA 02540.    </p>
