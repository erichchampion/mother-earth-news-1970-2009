                    <p>      In search of the original better mousetrap.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by David Petersen    </h5>                <p>      The seemingly innocuous little creature we call the weasel      is an insatiable killer driven to murderous frenzy by a      large parasite residing in its stomach. It sucks the blood      of its victims, conceives through its mouth and gives birth      through an ear, can squeeze itself through a wedding ring,      and magically changes from brown to white within hours of      the first snowfall each winter.    </p>    <p>      In my research I've run across each of those beliefs      concerning the weasel-some several      times-recorded as myth, legend, or scientific fact.      Of course, there's not a word of truth to any of them . . .      but lack of truth has seldom stopped people from believing      what they will about the mysteries of life. And, because of      its furtiveness, the weasel is a mystery.    </p>    <p>      That's why such a small creature holds such great interest      for me. Even though two of the three North American weasel      species live literally just beyond my door, the secretive      little buggers continually frustrate my efforts to observe      them in the wild for more than a few seconds at a time.    </p>    <p>      Others have better luck. The trick to weasel watching, a      photographer friend tells me, is finding the rascals on      their home turf. Near their dens, he says, they're not the      least bit shy-so long as you do nothing to startle      them. Once, my friend reports, an entire family of the      little squirts approached to within just a few yards and      cavorted for his camera.    </p>    <p>      I guess I've always been in the right places at the wrong      times and the wrong places the rest of the time. Or maybe      I'm just weasel jinxed. But I'll keep at it. And between      treks to the woods, I'll keep learning what I can from more      successful weasel watchers.    </p>    <p>      Weasels belong to the family of carnivores known to      biologists as Mustelidae-a tax onomic moniker that      translates crudely to "mouse stealers" and includes 64      species worldwide. North America's mustelids include      weasels, badgers, skunks, otters, minks, wolverines,      fishers, martens, and the critically endangered      black-footed ferret. The smallest of the lot is the least      weasel (imagine a svelte chipmunk), the largest is the sea      otter (up to six feet tongue to tail), and the most      powerful is the wolverine.    </p>        <p>      All mustelids have highly developed anal scent glands, from      which they can emit a strong musk more or less on demand.      Unlike the skunk, most lack the apparatus to spray their      musk any distance; instead they use the noxious perfume to      mark the boundaries of their territories and for      close-range selfdefense.    </p>    <p>      With few exceptions, no matter where in North America you      live, you're certain to have one or more of the continent's      three weasel species-long-tailed, short-tailed, and      least-as a secret neighbor. While each species has      its distinctive physical and behavioral traits, the three      are more alike than different. All can take prey much      larger than themselves and strike with blurring speed. All      can climb and swim but are primarily terrestrial, making      their homes in woodpiles, under rocks or fallen logs, and      in burrows appropriated from rodents who were literally      eaten out of house and home.    </p>    <p>      Weasels are primarily nocturnal but often venture out in      daylight. All have beady, forward-set eyes with the      binocular vision necessary to successful hunters; small,      rounded, close-set ears; large brains relative to the size      of their bodies (a characteristic shared by all predators,      including humans; elongated faces and even longer necks;      slender, sleek-furred bodies; short legs; fivetoed feet      with scimitar claws; and pencil-thin tails. The weasel's      average life expectancy is about six years.    </p>		    <p>      These pint-sized predators feed primarily on rodents-field      mice, ground squirrels, pocket gophers, moles, voles,      shrews, chipmunks, and rats-but also take lagomorphs      (rabbits, hares, and pikas), birds (including chickens) and      their eggs, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and fish.    </p>    <p>      In spite of their size (or lack of it), weasels are      ferocious hunters, locating their quarry primarily by scent      and shunning the common tactics of stalk and ambush in      favor of flush and chase. The weasel is both sprinter and      endurance runner, hinging its back, greyhoundlike, as it      bounds along tirelessly until it has worn down its fleeing      prey, then springing forward in a last lightning-fast leap      to seize its exhausted dinner. Additionally, the tiny      hunter's slim and supple form enables it to weasel through      any opening large enough to accommodate its head (which      your average wedding ring isn't), easily penetrating the      hidey-holes of its quarry-which it dispatches      instantly, with a powerful bite at the base of the skull.    </p>    <p>      Weasels need to eat an amount equal to only a quarter to a      third of their body weight daily. That means a mouse or two      a day will do. Still, when confronted with a particularly      happy hunting ground, the little terrors often will      continue killing until everything in sight is dead. Studies      indicate that movement triggers such massacres. As long as      there's a wriggle, jiggle, or squirm in an enclosed kill      area, the weasel will press its attack, often wiping out an      entire colony of mice-numbering in the      hundreds-or a coop full of chickens in a few furious      moments.    </p>    <p>      Understandably, the weasel is considered      "bloodthirsty"-a term appearing repeatedly in most of      the biology texts I've read. Today we know that      bloodthirstiness is a false charge, that the weasel isn't      some vampire guzzler of blood, and that its predatory      excesses are sparked, not by evil intent (and certainly not      by stomach parasites), but by instinct; in the weasel's      genes it is programmed that he must lay in food when it's      available, against those inevitable times when the pickings      will be slim. There's little waste, since most species      cache their excess kills in underground larders for future      meals.    </p>    <p>      The once common belief that weasels, especially the      short-tail (ermine), don seasonal camouflage by changing      color from dark to white at the time of the first      significant snowfall is based, not on myth or legend, but      on relatively recent scientific research. Until the late      1800s, biologists believed that weasels shed their brownish      summer pelage and replaced it with a thicker white winter      coat in response to the lowered temperatures of autumn.    </p>    <p>      That theory was refuted when researchers noticed that      captive weasels kept in heated buildings still molted. The      researchers also noted that their mustelid prisoners began      molting within 48 hours of the first real      snowfall-and thus was born the theory that the      seasonal onset of snowfall controls the timing of the      weasel's annual change from brown to white.    </p>    <p>      We now know that the weasel's biannual color change stems      not from snowfall but from a decreasing photoperiod: When      days become shorter in late fall, the decreasing daylight      triggers the weasel's pituitary gland to molt the summer      coat and simultaneously to inhibit the production of      hormones that produce the pigments coloring the weasel's      fur. Come spring with its lengthening days, this phenomenon      reverses itself, replacing the shed white fur with a dark      summer coat.    </p>    <p>      The myth that the weasel conceives through its mouth and      gives birth through an ear originated in the fertile      imaginations of ancient Greek storytellers. While the truth      isn't quite that strange, it's highly unusual in a couple      of ways.    </p>    <p>      In a process known as <em>induced ovulation,</em> the      female weasel releases her egg, not on a regular timetable      like most mammals, but only when it's needed-at the      instant of copulation. There's good reason for this: Adult      weasels are generally loners, so, rather than chancing a      mating meeting while the female's egg is not viable, nature      invented on-demand ovulation to make certain that an egg      will be ready and waiting whenever a male might happen      along to fertilize it.    </p>    <p>      The weasel's second unusual reproductive trait is called      <em>delayed implantation,</em> and applies to the      long-tailed and short-tailed species, but not to the least      weasel, which can mate and give birth at any time of year.      This biological anomaly allows mating to take place during      summer, when weasels are out and about and the most likely      to meet-but the resulting fertilized egg goes on      hold, not implanting in the uterus until late winter. This      months-long delay assures that the young will be born      during spring, when food is plentiful and living is at its      easiest.    </p>    <p>      Weasel kits are born with a strong hunt ing instinct, but      must learn strategy and tactics from their mothers (with      some help from the fathers in the long-tailed species). The      kits mature rapidly and, by the winter following their      birth, are fully grown and fending for themselves.    </p>    <p>      Despite the many similarities shared by all weasels, each      of the three North American species has its own physical      and behavioral distinctions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Least weasels</strong> <em>(Mustela nivalis),</em>      also known as common or pygmy weasels, have been aptly      called "cigar sized," with adults measuring 5.2 inches to a      little over 13 inches long (of which about a quarter is      tail) and weighing as little as 25 grams (less than an      ounce). In addition to being the smallest member of the      weasel family, <em>M. nivalis</em> also has the distinction      of being the smallest carnivore in the world. (A member of      this tiny species could, in fact, squeeze through a wedding      ring . . . providing the ring belonged to someone with a      finger diameter of an inch or so.)    </p>    <p>      In summer, this littlest hunter's fur is reddish brown      across the back and sides, with a white underbelly. The      least weasel keeps this two-toned coloration year-round in      the portions of its range that receive only spo radic      snowfall (though often fading to a lighter shade), but      molts to white for winter in colder climes. The most      reliable field identification feature of the least weasel      is lack of the black-tipped tail of both other species.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Short-tailed weasels</strong> ( <em>M. erminea</em>      <em>)</em> are commonly known as ermines during their      allwhite winter phase, and as stoats in their darker summer      pelage. Lagomorphs are their favored foods. This species      has a reputation for playfulness, and-when not      hunting or holed up in its burrow-is known to gather in      groups to frolic in the sunshine. (Perhaps this was the      temerarious species met by my photographer friend.)    </p>    <p>      The short-tailed weasel's summer coat is reddish brown      above, with yellowish underparts and a black-tipped tail.      In winter throughout its range-except for a strip along the      Pacific coast from British Columbia southward-the      short-tail turns pure white, save the tip of its tail,      which stays black. An adult short-tail will measure 7.5      inches to 13.4 inches nose to tip of tail, and, as you      might expect, has a shorter tail relative to its overall      length than the other two species.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Long-tailed weasels</strong> <em>(M. frenata),</em>      besides being the most plentiful and wide-ranging, are also      the largest of the three North American species, with      adults weighing 2.9 to 6.9 ounces and measuring 8.9 to 10.2      inches head and body, plus a generous 4 to 5.9 inches of      tail for a total length of 13 to 16 inches or so.    </p>    <p>      Northern long-tails turn white in winter (save for their      ink-tipped tails), while the various southern subspecies      merely fade to lighter shades of brown. Quite the athlete,      the long-tail may jump six feet straight up and take prey      10 times its own size. It has even attacked humans when      sufficiently provoked.    </p>    <p>      While humans are the only animals capable of premeditated      murder, you can't argue that weasels don't sometimes      indulge in instinctive overkill. Audubon reported a classic      example of just such a mustelid massacre (he watched more      than birds), writing that he had "known forty well grown      fowls to have been killed in one night by a single Ermine."    </p>    <p>      If you suspect a weasel of raiding your hen house, search      out and plug even the tiniest coop entrances-such as      knotholes and cracks. If that doesn't work, you'll have to      resort to trapping the raider-live or otherwise (as      dictated by your conscience or lust for revenge, whichever      is the stronger).    </p>    <p>      Unlike the least and short-tailed species, the long-tail is      a notorious chicken killer (it's quite possible that      Audubon's "Ermine" was in fact a white-phase long-tail).      But even the chicken-stealing long-tail benefits the farmer      in the long run, since it destroys rats that would      otherwise prey on eggs and newborn chicks, and limits the      number of crop-damaging mice.    </p>    <p>      Just how efficient a mousetrap is the weasel? One field      study conducted in a national park netted these hungry      statistics: In 37 days of observation, a mother weasel      brought to her litter of kits a total of 148 rodents,      including 2 moles, 3 rats, 4 ground squirrels, 27 gophers,      34 chipmunks, and 78 mice. In all, a single weasel will      kill from 500 to 1,000 prey animals-mostly      mice-a year.    </p>    <p>      In the final analysis, then, that weasel hiding in the      woodpile is neither monster nor magician, but the original      (and still champion) better mousetrap.    </p>
