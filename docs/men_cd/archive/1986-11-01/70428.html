            		<p><strong>Mother's Children</strong></p>            <p>      It's fun to sew your own stuffed bunnies.<br />     </p>		<h5 id="byline">      by Diana Scheck    </h5>            <p>      I decided to try to make miniature rabbits after seeing      various small stuffed animals at craft sales. I borrowed      some ideas from what I'd seen, added some of my own, and      came up with designs for mother and baby rabbits.    </p>    <p>      When I first started making them, I gave them as gifts to      friends and relatives. They liked the rabbits so much I      decided to try selling them. So far I've sold about 16 sets      for $6.50 each. I figured out it costs about $1 to make      each set. So all together I've earned about $88. I've also      taught my cousin to make them, and she has sold as many      sets as I have.    </p>    <p>      It takes me about two and a half hours to make each pair of      bunnies. Whenever possible I try to recycle materials. The      cotton I use comes from vitamin bottles. The baby rabbit's      bed is half of a walnut shell. And I buy my small scraps of      fabrics, and odds and ends of ribbons and lace, at garage      sales and swap meets for almost nothing.    </p>    <p>      If you decide to make these rabbits, you'll find that it's      hard work, and you'll probably make some mistakes at first.      (You may want to ask an adult to help you understand the      sewing instructions.) But the results are rewarding. I've      done well selling miniature rabbits, and I think you can,      too.    </p>    <h3>      Directions    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Materials:</strong> Unbleached muslin, fabric with      a miniature print, white felt, 1/4" and 1/8" ribbon,      pregathered lace (or you can gather it yourself), black      seed beads, walnut shell halves, heavy black thread (for      whiskers), miniature flowers, pink crayon, cotton (for      stuffing).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Body:</strong> Draw the pattern-to      scale-on 1/4" graph paper. Label the pieces and cut      them out. Using a pencil, trace the rabbit body twice onto      muslin. Cut the pieces out, and pin them right sides      together. Stitch the two body pieces together 3/16" in from      the edge, but leave the bottom open. Turn the body inside      (right side) out. Mark the locations of the eyes and nose.      Stuff the rabbit with cotton. Cut the circular base from      felt, and, tucking under the raw edges of the muslin,      stitch it to the bottom of the rabbit.    </p>    <p>      Cut two felt ears and slipstitch them to the head. Sew      black seed-bead eyes on. As you push the needle through the      head, pull the thread a bit tight to indent the eye area.      Sew heavy, doubled black thread through the nose: Push the      needle through the stuffing, bring it around and push it      through the same place again, this time pulling a little to      point the nose. Clip the ends to make whiskers. Apply some      color to the nose, ears, and cheeks with a pink crayon.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Dress:</strong> Fold the printed fabric right sides      together, and pin the dress pattern along the fold as      indicated. Cut it out, and-still with the wrong sides      out-stitch the sides together with 3/8" seams. Turn      right sides out, press, and trim the bottom raw edges with      lace. Run a basting stitch 1/2" in from the top, and pull      it to make gathers to fit the rabbit's neck. Tack the dress      to the rabbit in a couple of places.    </p>    <p>      Cut two sleeve pieces. Press all their raw edges in 1/8"      with an iron. Then fold each sleeve-right side      out-in three (like a letter about to be mailed), and      slipstitch closed. Trim the bottom edge with lace. Tack the      top of each sleeve to the dress at the rabbit's shoulders.      Bend the sleeves a bit and tack the lace to look like      hands. For a cheer ful note, attach a flower to one of the      hands.    </p>        <p>      With 1/4 " ribbon, tie a bow around the rabbit's neck over      the gathers. Make another bow from 1/4" ribbon, and tack it      to the dress at the center back, right above the lace.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Baby:</strong> From fabric that matches the      mother's dress, cut a piece a little larger than the      opening of your walnut shell. Stuff the walnut half with      cotton. Fold under all the raw edges of the fabric, and      glue the pieces to the walnut.    </p>    <p>      Cut two baby's head pieces from felt. Glue the front half      of the baby's face together, but leave the back half open.      Sew on heavy thread whiskers. Spread open the back of the      head and glue it to one end of the walnut. Glue on black      bead eyes. Cut and glue on ears. Make a small bow from 1/8"      ribbon, and glue it to the walnut at the opposite end from      the head. Gather lace for the baby's bonnet, sew its ends      together to make a circle, and glue it to the walnut behind      the baby's head.    </p>
