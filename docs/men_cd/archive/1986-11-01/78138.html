                    <p>      Main    </p>		       <p>      Now that you've seen what can happen when you let a chain      saw run amok, I'd like to talk about a more practical      design. I've built two of these log cabins as rentals, and      they're perhaps the most efficient (in terms of materials      and space) and practical I've done. With no roof or floor      insulation, they stay comfortable with one woodstove in      20Â°F weather. My tenants seem to be very pleased with      them.    </p>    <p>      I used pier foundations: pyramids of rock and mortar about      2' high with pieces of rebar sticking out the top to pin      the sill logs. (Keeping the logs at least 14" away from the      ground is the most important way to make a log house last.)      The piers are about 3' across at the base and are spaced 6'      apart. I just scraped away the organic layer of soil and      laid the piers right on the subsoil.    </p>    <p>      Technically, both of these houses are mobile homes: They      have no permanent foundations and could be moved with a D-9      Caterpillar. Septic and building permits for mobile homes      are about $1,000 cheaper than those for "permanent"      structures, at least in my part of the country, and I saved      $1,800 per building over a solid-concrete foundation.    </p>    <p>      All of the logs are joined at the ends with half-round      notches, which are the easiest and most effective type I've      tried. Each joint is spiked, and the logs are pinned with      1/2" water pipe on each side of a window or door.    </p>    <p>      The floor joists are logs with one face cut flat, and I      used 2 X 6 tongue-and-groove (T&G) boards for all the      flooring. I arranged the joists so that I could use      odd-length pieces of T&G, which the mill sold me for      quite a bit less than premium 8', 12', and 16' boards.    </p>    <p>      By the time I built these houses, I'd figured out that full      second floors are more practical than lofts. Not only do      they provide a lot more floor space, but they can also be      sealed off to even out the heat in the house. I've found      that the second floor is comfortable for sleeping even with      the hatch between floors closed, and the first floor stays      much cozier.    </p>    <p>      I've tried cedar shakes, aluminum sheets, asphalt shingles,      and roll roofing, but as far as I'm concerned, none of them      stacks up to colored steel roofing. It's durable,      economical, and easy to install, and the brown color looks      great on log houses. On these houses the metal is secured      to random-width planks I got for $100 a stack (about 8,000      board feet), but my Alaskan duplex is firred out with 2 X      6s and has 5 1//2" of polystyrene insulation.    </p>    <p>      Instead of putting dormers in the roof, which are      attractive but time-consuming to build, I just glassed in      the gable ends. These work OK for light, but for appearance      and ventilation, it might be worth the effort to build      dormers. There's a screened vent near the peak at each end      of the house, so that hot summer air can rise to the      ceiling and escape.    </p>    <p>      I really worked on coming up with low-cost floor-finishing      techniques on these homes, and, as a result, they have the      nicest combinations of tile, rock, wood, and carpet of any      of my houses. I even rocked the entries and the areas where      the woodstoves go. I bought the carpet as roll remnants and      laid it on salvaged particle board I got for $2 per sheet.    </p>    <p>      Both of these rentals are powered by hydroelectricity. I      tapped springs high on the surrounding hillsides and tied      them into high-head, low-water-flow turbines from Harris      Hydroelectric Systems (632 Swanton Rd., Davenport, CA      95017). The 12-volt electrical systems simplified wiring.      Hot water comes from coils in the woodstoves.    </p>    <p>      Even with all these nice details, the most I've spent on      either of these 24' X 47' houses is $5,000.    </p>
