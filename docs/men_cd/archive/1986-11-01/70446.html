                <p>Getting the most from your</p>        <p>      In winter, every inch of growing space is precious.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Nancy Bubel    </h5>        <p>      Remember how much you longed for your first bicycle-      or car? That's how much I wanted a solar greenhouse! Many a      winter I raised seedlings under fluorescent lights, always      wishing the abundant sunlight of our south-facing land      could reach my starts.    </p>    <p>      Well, dreaming, planning, and saving finally led to      building. And now there is a modest solar greenhouse      attached to our small Pennsylvania home. But, as always      happens when I get something I've longed for, the realized      dream brought with it a challenge: learning to use my      greenhouse well. So, over the past few years, I've studied,      experimented, and observed carefully, and-even though      I still consider myself a beginning solar      gardener-I've learned a lot I'd like to share.    </p>    <h3>      A Room of Many Uses    </h3>		    <p>      Solar greenhouses can be much more than a place to start      spring seedlings. Mine provides such delights as crisp      cucumbers in December, green chard in January, and      succulent Chinese cabbage in February. It also    </p>    <p>      • protects tender herbs and geraniums over      winter,<br />      • dries mint and such in summer,<br />      • cures harvested onions and garlic,<br />      • yields a fall harvest of potted peppers, tomatoes,      eggplants, cucumbers, and such, and<br />      • easily roots cuttings of grapes, geraniums, and      herbs (I use the loose, moist soil of my large growing bed      for this).    </p>    <p>      Whatever design you choose for your greenhouse, I heartily      recommend that it include a large growing bed. The soil      will serve as an excellent, moisture-retaining plant home      and will provide mass for absorbing and holding the sun's      warmth.    </p>    <p>      When we built our greenhouse, we left the growing bed's      foundation open for drainage. We shoveled 3" of gravel into      the bed, and we topped that with a layer of 4"-thick      "books" peeled from bales of spoiled hay. Next came 4" of      decomposing wood chips, 4" of compost, and 8" of loose      garden soil mixed with several large bagfuls of vermiculite      and commercial potting soil.    </p>    <p>      Each year we add another 2" to 3" layer of compost and      about three quarts of wood ashes to the bed. We dig in      clean, fine-textured kitchen scraps such as coffee and tea      grounds . . . and toss in a few earthworms from time to      time to help digest the scraps, aerate the bed, and add      rich castings.    </p>    <p>      While the design of a greenhouse sets the limits upon its      potential efficiency, you can juggle four other factors to      maximize output: light, temperature, humidity, and carbon      dioxide concentration.    </p>    <h3>      Light    </h3>        <p>      Most vegetables need at least eight hours of light a day to      thrive. Light-starved plants will show one or more of the      following symptoms: elongated, frail stems; sparse leaves;      slow growth; excess leaning toward the light.    </p>    <p>      To raise light levels, first check outside to be sure no      trees, woodpiles, or leaning snow shovels shade the      greenhouse. Next, paint all interior walls and shelves      white. (Use exterior-grade paint to withstand the high      humidity.) If you use heat-storing barrels that face the      sun on one side and plants on the other, slap some      reflective white paint on the sides toward the plants (but      make the sunny sides heat-absorbing black).    </p>    <p>      Shane Smith, whose <em>The Bountiful Solar Greenhouse</em>      has been one of my most helpful guides, suggests that when      light levels are low, it's important to keep the greenhouse      as warm as you can and to avoid overcrowding the plants.    </p>    <h3>      Temperature    </h3>    <p>      Many people, when raising the kind of cool-weather crops      best suited to winter greenhouse gardening, find that      <em>overheating</em> causes more problems than cold      temperatures (unless some dummy forgets, as I once did, to      latch the door; that was the end of my tomato plants!).      Greenhouse temperatures can hit the 90s when sunlight is      intense. A little overheating won't hurt most crops, but      more than four to six hours of sweltering can make      cool-weather crops like Chinese cabbage tough and bitter.    </p>    <p>      To moderate swings from cool to hot, add more thermal mass:      another water-filled barrel, a brick retaining wall, or      some waterfilled shelf jugs. You can also vent your      structure whenever it gets too warm.    </p>    <p>      Of course, don't let your greenhouse get too cold, either.      But remember that soil temperature is more critical than      air temperature. (Use a soil thermometer-filled with      alcohol, not mercury, in case of breakage-to monitor      your bed's temperature.) Chilly night air doesn't seem to      hurt plants-as long as they don't freeze. But roots      have trouble absorbing water and nutrients when the soil      temperature drops below 45°. That's another advantage      of a deep bed: It holds warmth better than do shallow beds      or pots. Watering with warm water can also help raise soil      temperature.    </p>    <h3>      Humidity    </h3>    <p>      Plants grow best in moderately moist air-45 to 60%      relative humidity. Most do fine at 7%, too. But molds and      diseases thrive as humidity rises toward 90%, and will      slow, often stop, plant growth.    </p>    <p>      So don't overwater (a common mistake). Most plants grow      slowly in winter and need only weekly waterings. Here      again, a humus-filled deep bed will serve you well: It      holds moisture and doles it out gradually.    </p>    <p>      If you do have humidity troubles, open a      greenhouse-to-house vent so the excess moisture can escape      into the drier house air.    </p>    <h3>      CO 2    </h3>    <p>      Light, temperature, and humidity problems are easy to spot,      and you can measure levels with common instruments. You      won't, however, find a CO 2 meter at your local hardware      store; indeed, you're not likely to even notice specific      symptoms of a carbon dioxide shortage. It's safe to assume      that just about <em>any</em> tightly closed greenhouse will      be short on CO 2 .    </p>    <p>      And that deficiency will slash output, because CO 2 is a      plant's only source of the element carbon, which makes up      half of its dry weight. CO 2 is essential to      photosynthesis, the process by which plants make new      tissue. In winter, an abundance of CO 2 can actually keep      plants growing when they get less than ideal doses of      light.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, plants in a well-sealed greenhouse may use      up all the available carbon dioxide by early morning!      (According to researchers, a thin layer of CO 2 -deficient      air hovers around the vegetation in an unvented      greenhouse.) To get more CO 2 to your plants, vent the      greenhouse to break up stale air pockets and to let in a      fresh supply of CO 2 .    </p>    <p>      If the weather's too cold for continuous venting, build a      fresh compost pile under a bench. It will eventually give      off between one-third and one-half of its dry weight in CO      2 . You might also run a fan.    </p>    <h3>      Full House    </h3>    <p>      Greenhouse space is precious, so we cram as much as we can      into our growing bed. For instance, in late winter (see      diagram, page 75), it yields radishes, parsley (or green      onion tops), Bibb lettuce, Chinese cabbage (spoon and      mizuna), and Swiss chard. Flowering tomato plants and eager      new cucumber vines promise May salad treats. Along the damp      edges of the bed, geranium, grapevine, forsythia, pussy      willow, and herb cuttings supply gift plants for visiting      friends. And a row of calendulas adds color.    </p>    <p>      Before long, plants carpet the room. There I stand,      juggling a flat of tomato seedlings in one hand and a pot      of petunias in the other, wondering where to put them.      That's when I appreciate the area above the growing bed,      the high back shelves, even the windowsills. A determined      gardener makes creative use of every cranny.    </p>    <p>      Take that petunia-or New Zealand spinach, or sweet      potato, or one of a dozen other plants whose natural habit      is trailing or vining. Perch it on a shelf so the leaves      and flowers can cascade down into the light. What about      those tomatoes? If they're a bush variety like Pixie Hybrid      or Basket King (Geo. W. Park Seed Co., Box 31, Greenwood,      SC 29647), they'll do well in hanging baskets.    </p>    <p>      A trellis-or other support of string, poles, netting,      or fencing-also makes good use of vertical space. Our      cucumbers climb a fence on the front window framing,      leaving space for a small plantation of Bibb lettuce      behind.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Care and Feeding of Crops<br /></strong><br />      When planting seeds in the greenhouse, I use plain      vermiculite or a loose, fluffy potting soil mix I buy in      bulk from a local greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      Seeds don't need food-just moisture, warmth, and air.      Seedlings, though, need something to grow on. So I line      their flats with a layer of moss, some fine compost, then      potting soil. (I use a store-bought mix. For a good      homemade mix, combine equal parts of leaf mold, sphagnum or      peat moss, and perlite or sharp sand. Equal amounts of      compost, good loamy soil, and sharp sand, perlite, or      vermiculite also make a good mix.) I transplant seedlings      to flats when they develop their first true leaves, then      water them with a diluted solution of kelp (about two      tablespoons per gallon of water). This nourishment should      last at least two weeks. After that, I feed the      seedlings-and all my crops-every 10 to 14 days      with fish emulsion or compost tea.    </p>    <p>      During the worst of winter, when the soil is cold and the      light level low, plants don't need much food, so I switch      to half-strength feedings. (Overfeeding crops, especially      with nitrogen-rich fertilizers, results in sappy growth      that attracts insects and invites disease.) As days      lengthen and the sun gets more assertive, I increase the      strength and frequency of feedings, especially for leaf      crops and my greedy but prolific cucumbers. (I don't      fertilize overwintered herbs at all; I don't want them to      outgrow their pots before spring.)    </p>    <h3>      My Favorite Winter Vegetables    </h3>    <p>      Although it may feel balmy on a sunny day, a solar      greenhouse is basically a cool greenhouse, so plan on      raising only vegetables that can take a night chill. And      remember that, under glass, leaf crops produce better than      fruits.    </p>    <p>      Timing is also important. I start my fall greenhouse crops      in August or September so they'll develop before the earth      turns away from the sun. Seedlings planted between October      and January-when sunlight is weakest-may need      twice as many days to produce. In spring, the growth rate      speeds up. Late winter seedlings may mark time during the      low days-January 1 to February 15 here in central      Pennsylvania. But once willow twigs turn yellow and snow      starts to melt, those starts will take off.    </p>    <p>      I've worked up a list of my favorite solar greenhouse      vegetables, in order of personal preference. My choices are      based partly on results and partly on out-of-season      desirability-fresh cucumbers and greens are hard to      come by in January!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cucumbers</strong> are a zinger crop. They taste      great and make you feel pampered when trees are bare. The      new European types produce all-female, self-pollinating      blossoms, and their greenhouse-grown fruits taste much      better than garden cucumbers. Seeds are costly, but a      packet can last for two or three plantings. Dynasty (from      Otis Twilley Seed Co., Box 65, Trevose, PA 19047) and      Superator (Stokes Seeds, 28 Water St., Fredonia, NY 14063)      are two good varieties.    </p>    <p>      Greenhouse cukes like the good life-warm soil, weekly      feedings, and frequent warm waterings (every other day when      fruiting). They prefer soil temperatures above 55° or      60°F, but can tolerate cool greenhouse nights      <em>if</em> they get lots of light and warmth during the      day.    </p>    <p>      I grow two indoor cucumber crops a year, planting in August      or September for a November-December harvest, and again in      February for May-June eating. Overproduction weakens the      plants and cuts fruit size, so Colleen Armstrong (staff      horticulturist at the New Alchemy Institute) suggests      removing every sucker from the six lowest leaf joints,      cutting the next eight shoots back to a single leaf, and      letting the rest develop two or three leaves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Swiss chard</strong> has been my most reliable and      long-lasting leafy green. (The deep-rooted plant can      survive over a week without water in my deep bed.) Low in      calories and high in vitamins, chard tastes much milder      when grown indoors. I plant seeds in August or September,      start picking the succulent, seersuckered leaves in      December, and keep harvesting until outdoor greens take      over.    </p>    <p>      When cloudy midwinter days make me keep the greenhouse      closed up, a plague of aphids or whiteflies sometimes hits      my chard. But once I start opening vents regularly again,      the bug pox clears, and the leaves become clean and green.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chinese cabbage</strong> and other      <strong>Oriental</strong> <strong>greens</strong> get two      plantings-fall and winter-like cucumbers. Loose-leaf      varieties do better than heading ones. I've had good luck      with Prize Choy (Johnny's Selected Seeds, Box 2580, Albion,      ME 04910), Shanghai Pak Choi, and Spoon Cabbage (both from      Kitazwa Seed Co., 1748 Laine Ave., Santa Clara, CA 95051).    </p>    <p>      Another Oriental green, kyona (also called mizuna, and also      from Kitazwa Seed Co.), provides many cuttings of tender,      mild-flavored, fringed leaves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bibb lettuce,</strong> with its delicate buttery      soft heads, is perfect for the greenhouse. I also like      Magnet, a forcing butterhead (The Cook's Garden, Box 65,      Londonderry, VT 05148) and Mescher, a wonderful heirloom      butterhead I got from a fellow member of the Seed Savers      Exchange. Lettuce likes rich soil, lots of moisture, and      good drainage. For the best harvest, plant the fall crop      early and replant often. (Don't count on head lettuce in a      greenhouse; it takes too long to develop.)    </p>    <p>      Hothouse <strong>radishes</strong> are fun to grow and have      an unusually mild flavor. You can easily sneak them into a      pot or along the edge of a bed. They form roots best in the      lengthening days of spring. Plentiful moisture makes them      crisp and mild.    </p>    <p>      <strong>New Zealand spinach</strong> surprises everyone who      tries it with its luxuriant growth. A good space-saving      plant, it can either grow in a tub on a shelf-vines      spilling down into the sun-or climb a trellis or      string. Start picking leaves two months after you plant the      seed (which will germinate better if you file a little      notch in its tough coat, then soak it overnight).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Onions</strong> won't bulb up in the depths of      winter, but will yield a modest supply of savory green      spears. Chives make a good greenhouse crop, too. (Let      perennials freeze outdoors for two weeks before you bring      them into the greenhouse. They need a rest after producing      all summer.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tomatoes</strong> don't always earn their space,      but, ah, the satisfaction of raising even a few      <em>real</em> tomatoes in the off season! Small-fruited      kinds like Presto, Pixie Hybrid, and Sweet 100 (Geo. W.      Park Seed Co., address above) will bear more and ripen      faster than fullsized varieties. If you insist on large      fruit, Vendor (Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, P.O. Box      158, North Garden, VA 22959; catalog $2) and Park's      Greenhouse Hybrid are good to try.    </p>    <p>      Start with potted tomatoes in the fall, either summer      seedlings or rooted cuttings from established plants. They      should start to bear by New Year's. You can also bring      potted adult plants inside for a few extra weeks of fall      fruits. Then start more seeds in December for a May      harvest. I often use coldtolerant Siberia and Santa      (Siberia Seeds, Box 2026, Sweetgrass, MT 59484) varieties      for spring plantings. Wind normally helps tomatoes      self-pollinate, but with few breezes indoors, jiggle      blossoming plants several times a week to disperse pollen.    </p>    <p>      Greenhouse <strong>peppers</strong> tend to be small but      are nonetheless welcome salad material when the outdoor      garden is frozen. I often use extra starts from the      previous spring-kept in two-gallon pots on our sunny      patio over summer-for fall indoor plants. You can      also sow seeds in May, grow them in pots until August, then      transplant them to the greenhouse growing bed. Perennials      in their native Tropics, peppers will keep leafing and      bearing as long as they're healthy. Whitefly and aphid      infestations, though, often result in disease.    </p>    <p>      Both <strong>beets and turnips</strong> grow well in      greenhouses. You can plant them in fall, winter, or      spring-directly in the growing bed or in 8"-deep pots      or tubs. Eat them while the roots are small, and cook the      greens, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Green beans</strong> make a fun spring crop:      They're self-pollinating and like warm soil. Sow them in      early March and harvest in June. You can even plant      climbing beans in summer to shade the greenhouse or as an      off-season green manure crop to add nitrogen to the soil.    </p>    <h3>      Grow to It    </h3>    <p>      I think of my solar greenhouse as a little resort: I go      there whenever I need a renewing breath of balmy, leaf- and      earthscented air or a few relaxing minutes of pruning and      transplanting. But I also want to raise food and flowers,      start seedlings, dry herbs, cure onions, and propagate      cuttings. Getting the most from a greenhouse-bounty      as well as peacefulness-takes both time and practice,      but the results are worth the effort.    </p>    <h3>      DEALING WITH DISEASE    </h3>    <p>      You can prevent greenhouse diseases more easily than you      can cure them. The following prevention tips are important.      In fact, you may want to print them up on a little poster,      especially if several people use or visit your greenhouse.    </p>    <p>      1. Do all you can to raise healthy plants.<br />      2. Grow disease-resistant varieties.<br />      3. Avoid overcrowding plants.<br />      4. Keep the space well-ventilated. Venting dissipates      excess heat, lets in carbon dioxide, and sets up a lively      pattern of circulating air that discourages fungus disease      and whiteflies.<br />      5. Never smoke in the greenhouse, or handle tobacco-family      plants-like peppers or tomatoes-after you've      been smoking. Tobacco mosaic virus is highly      contagious.<br />      6. Don't use old potting soil for new seedlings-it      may bring in damping-off disease.<br />      7. Remove and compost (or burn) all dead leaves and      diseased plants.    </p>    <p>      Nancy Bubel is a long-time garden and country-living writer      and the author of The Seed Starter's Handbook      and-with her husband, Mike-Root Cellaring .
