        There are many reasons to buy an electric chain saw: They emit noexhaust, they are almost maintenance-free, they weigh less and theyalways start with just a flick of a switch. Unfortunately, one ofthe drawbacks is their electric cord. In addition to lugging thecord around, cord pliability is dramatically reduced intemperatures below 40 degrees.<br /><br />It's also important to use the correct gauge of cord becausemaximum cord length is dictated by a saw's amperage rating. Mostoutdoor circuits are 15-amp, and cords lose amperage the longerthey run from the source. Under load, saw motors overheat unlessthe cord is of sufficient gauge and shortness to maintainsufficient amperage. Saws rate in the 7- to 12-amp range can workat distances up to 150 feet, with a specified cord. But some sawsrated 15 amps or higher need a gauge of 12 for just 50 feet.<br /><br />Double check that the length and gauge of your cord meets yoursaw's requirements. Outdoor-rated cords are round-jacketed andstamped with a suffix of 'W' or 'W-A,' for Wet or Wet-Applications,as in SJTW or SJTW-A.
