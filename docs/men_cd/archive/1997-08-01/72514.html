            		<p>      <strong>COUNTRY VET</strong>    </p>    		<p>      <strong>Horses are born to run, but not as hard as you      might imagine.</strong>		</p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Andrea Looney, DVM    </h5>        <p>		 <strong>What warm-up procedure do you recommend for a 6-year old Morgan mare? We      ride or drive her almost daily and with so much concern      over exercise intolerance, we are willing to do what it      takes to help her exercise property. Is there any set      protocol for a horse this age, working about a half hour      daily?</strong></p><p> <em>-Owen Grant<br />      Knoxville, TN</em>    </p>        <p>      Horses are naturally designed for quick bursts of energy to      flee predators or escape fear. This fight-or-flight      response in the wild need usually be sustained for only a      few moments. However, today's horses are asked to perform      for many hours at maximal energy requirements. Just like      their human Olympic counterparts, an equine athlete needs      to limber up and cool down properly. Here's some hints for      a routine that really needs to be tailored to your horse's      daily workload, feed intake, life stage, conformation, and      other health problems. Warm-ups should be no more than      10-15 minutes long and will improve the efficiency of the      muscles working at the same time it reduces risk of injury      to ligaments, tendons, and joints. The cardiorespiratory      system also profits by increasing its oxygen uptake and      efficient use.</p><p> To maximize heavy upper muscle elasticity,      try manual stretching. During the forelimb stretch, stand      to the front and side of the animal and pick up the front      leg by grasping it above the knee, and gently pull it      forward. Pull the leg gently to the outside and across in      front of the other forelimb. Pull the leg to the outside      and then finally backward towards the hindlimbs. During the      stretch of the hindlegs, grasp the leg just below the hock      while standing next to the front shoulder of the animal,      and pull forward slowly. The hindlimb may also be gently      tugged out to the side and then directly backwards. These      stretches should be held for 10-15 seconds in each      direction. If the animal becomes uncomfortable, they should      be stopped and attempted at a later date. These maneuvers      are extremely helpful in adding flexibility and suppleness      to the muscles of the shoulder, elbow, hip, and epaxial      (back) muscles.</p><p> Making the animal reach down to the ground,      high up in the air, or around to the side of its body for a      favorite treat are what's known as "carrot stretches."      These stretches are extremely useful for dressage animals      and those doing tight circling maneuvers and will improve      flexibility and tone in the neck and shoulder muscles.</p><p> In      addition to all of the above stretches, walking can be done      under saddle, in hand, or on a long line. Start slowly and      increase gradually to a brisk pace. Easy trotting further      improves oxygen uptake and cardiac output. These two      exercises should be performed in the beginning of each      workout before any further strenuous work. Trotting's      symmetrical pace also makes it easy to pinpoint lameness      before more difficult exercise worsens them beyond repair.      Both these gaits are used in warm up to facilitate      stretching of the distal limb muscles, tendons, and      ligaments. Sidestepping and tight serpentine workouts at      the walk are advocated by many horse folk as a method of      not only "collecting" the animal but making sure back and      neck muscles are ready for a further workout.</p>        <p>      Our 4-year old Appaloosa mare had pads placed on her<br />      front feet last year for a sole bruise on one foot. What do<br />      you think about padding shod horses? Should we continue<br /> to      have her shoes padded?</p><p> <em>-Maura Thompson<br />      Odessa, TX</em> </p><p>Massaging major muscle groups,      specifically back and hip muscles, will improve range of      motion and increase circulation to major body organs, such      as the spleen and kidney, as well as increase circulation      in the muscle bellies themselves. With firm pressure, use      the heel of the hand to create a circular massaging motion      over each muscle group. The horse will relax and lean into      the pressure after a few go-rounds. Likewise, using a thick      curry comb, followed by a brisk brushing, will also      stimulate skin and superficial epidermal/dermal blood flow      while removing sweat and dirt.</p><p> Whatever the warm-up, be      sure to go slowly when conditioning the horse to any new      exercise. Also, be sure to switch patterns of exercise      frequently after a proper warm-up to avoid performance      "burnout." Pads are often added to shoes if more than just      applying a standard shoe to cover the bearing surface of      the hoof wall is necessary, or for healing short-term      problems such as sole abscesses, puncture wounds, bruises,      corns, or severe inflammation of the third phalanx or      navicular bone. These problems can cause a great deal of      lay-up time and consequently, it may be advantageous to pad      the shoe, encasing the entire bottom of the foot in a      "protective" coating.</p><p> I use the term "protective" loosely      however, because padding may have some adverse long-range      effects that may outweigh its benefits. A full pad may      reduce the chance of bruising the sensitive tissues and      will reduce some concussions to the foot. However, the feet      then never have access to the ground. The sole consequently      can become very soft and vulnerable to injury and deep      bruising. The hoof wall tends to lose its grip in the nails      since the shoe now is farther from the wall proper. Without      support from the ground surface, the sole begins to flatten      and may even develop bacterial (thrush) or fungal growth on      its surface or, worse yet, in hidden injuries due to      moisture and dirt trapped under the pad.</p><p> While most horses      do not require pads year round, a horse with laminitis,      navicular disease, or one that is prone to bruising on      heels or sole from genetically flattened feet or lax      tendons may benefit from padded shoes. Unless your horse      has one of these problems, I would suggest keeping the pads      off. Turn out and regular exercise on appropriate      supporting surfaces help strengthen and toughen feet and      may provide an alternative to chronic padding. Try not to      be overzealous with the hoof knife or rasp, so as to remove      too much hoof yet leave behind a flat (vs. concave) sole.      Your farrier will use appropriate caution to make sure sole      and frog are well above ground level. Finally, formulas      with phenol, formalin, or even straight Clorox precipitate      and injure valuable sole, and may weaken the hoof wall if      used on a regular basis in solutions or baths.</p><p> <strong>What      concentration of iodine is needed in teat dips-should      you require a certain percentage?</strong></p><p> <em>-      Judith Greene<br />      Rutland, VT</em></p><p> The cleaner an udder is when it's time to      put on the teat cups, the lower the concentration of      germicide needed to kill the bacteria that causes mastitis.      A famous dairy veterinarian, now professor emeritus and a      friend of mine, once told me in school that you should aim      for three things in the udder-care department: clean, dry,      and comfortable. If the udder hygiene program is up to      speed, then the concentration of sanitizer can be low.</p><p>      Research has indicated that 0.1 to 0.5 percent iodine dips      are useful for premilking bacterial reduction. These same      concentrations and up to 1.0 percent iodine were effective      after milking. Just as important as the concentration of      the dip, however, were things like its viscosity (which may      change in weather extremes and will affect the amount of      dip that adheres to each teat), addition of any skin      conditioners (which ultimately will affect how often the      dip is used) and its residue potential (probably a bigger      problem with pre-milking dips).</p><p> Try to keep the teats clean      with warm water and dried properly (individual paper      toweling), especially after milking, to avoid using dips as      much as possible and to strive for the lowest concentration      germicide in the dip. Phone several companies before      purchasing to see if their dips have been tested both in      controlled research environments and in the field, and have      been shown to be not only efficacious but safe to the udder      as well.</p><p> <strong>We have several cows lame with what looks      to be symptoms of founder. We don't have much mastitis.      Could this be feed related?</strong> <em>-Richard      Newcomb<br />      Lebanon, PA</em> </p><p>A balanced dairy ration is made up of      proper amounts of fiber, protein, energy, minerals, and      vitamins, with the most important ingredients being the      first three listed. The fiber comes from forage or roughage      (hay, haylage, or silage). The protein usually comes from      high protein by-products or forages, such as oil-seed meals      or high calcium hays. The energy is starch or grain      related, mostly corn in the eastern United States. However,      barley and other grains may also be fed.</p><p> Problems in dairy      cows often occur when different proportions of fiber,      protein, and energy become out of balance in their feed      rations. A common occurrence is feeding too much energy in      the form of grain, which can lead to ruminal acidosis,      laminitis, and displaced abomassums. Compensation for this      increased grain usually comes in the form of the farmer      increasing haylage or silage. The unfortunate problem with      this solution is that the silage is usually corn related,      which again (depending on the growing season and whether      it's ground or shelled), may also contain more relative      grain than the original energy source.</p><p> First try increasing      dry matter with grass haylage vs. silage. Try replacing      some or all of the ground corn with another grain such as      soybean, or a different type of corn (less concentrated).      The carbohydrate (starch) is often the ingredient that if      slightly out of balance may create the most trouble.      Nutritional analysis of the silage currently being fed by      your veterinarian or extension office may help you      formulate a new ration balanced for energy, protein, and      fiber-and custom made for your wallet and your herd's      health.    </p>
