                <p><strong>      MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong>    </p>            <p>      When I was growing up in Michigan, it was tough to beat the      summer heat. Neither our house nor our car was      air-conditioned because back then it seemed only rich      people could afford to be sweat less. Then our grandparents      installed an air conditioner in their bedroom, which      motivated us to drop in more often. My sister and I would      run up the stairs and throw ourselves down on the cool bed,      exhaling a sigh of relief. If our grandmother ever minded      our sweaty, smelly bodies on her white bedding she never      expressed it. After we cooled down, we'd return downstairs      to the screened-in porch to lounge on the rattan furniture      where our grandmother would bring us freshly squeezed      lemonade and homemade cookies. Warm breezes and cold drinks      made the time pass too quickly until sunset forced our      departure.    </p>        <p><strong>      Think it's crazy to toss down a brimming bowl of soup in      August? Anne Vassal doesn't.</strong>    </p>    <p>      My summers continue to remain the same. You can find me      lounging in a lawn chair under a shady tree with a large      pile of cooking magazines. I'll be drinking iced herbal tea      with mint and munching on fresh fruit. You won't see me      swimming laps or chasing after tennis balls. An occasional      bike ride will fill my exercise quota. This is why I like      to make light and easy soups using garden produce. I      prepare the soups early in the morning so that the rest of      the day is free. I don't mind eating them a few days      consecutively served with a vegetable sandwich or salad. So      cook light, keep cool, enjoy the summer's produce.</p>			<h3>Minty Cuke Soup</h3>			<p> I love this chilled soup      on a steamy, hot day, and it takes only minutes to make. If      you don't have chives or mint in your garden, try dill or      cilantro.</p><p> Put into a blender:<br />      <em>1 cup unsalted chicken broth (or vegetable      broth)<br /></em> <em>3 small cucumbers, peeled<br />      1/3 cup chopped chives<br />      1/3 cup mint leaves (no stems)<br />      2 large cloves, peeled and mashed<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      3 - 4 drops hot sauce</em></p><p> Blend until smooth and pour into      a bowl. Whisk in:<br />      <em>2 cups plain yogurt<br /></em> Chill for at least two      hours. Serve cold topped with the optional toppings:<br />      <em>chopped green or yellow pepper<br />      chopped cucumber<br />      chopped tomato<br />      chopped chives<br /></em><br /></p>			<h3>Blueberry Soup</h3>			<p> Another easy, low-fat soup      that's best eaten the same day. If you do have some      leftover, whisk before eating the following day.</p><p> In a      blender put the following:<br />      <em>1 cup orange juice<br /></em> <em>1 cup low-fat      buttermilk<br />      1 tablespoon honey<br />      1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br />      1 cup fresh blueberries<br />      1/4 teaspoon ground ginger<br />      blueberries and mint sprigs for garnish (optional)</em></p><p>      Blend well. Chill about two hours. Garnish each bowl with a      few berries and a mint sprig. </p>			<h3>Roasted Red Pepper Soup</h3>			<p> This hot but light soup uses up some of those      red peppers in the garden and any herbs that you may want      to use up. I like to keep roasted red peppers on hand in a      plastic container for salads or sandwiches or lay them on a      cookie sheet and freeze them. They'll keep in the      refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>			<h3>Roasted Red Peppers</h3>			<p>Cut as many red peppers as you like into      quarters. Cut out the stems and seeds and place the peppers      skin side up on a foillined baking sheet. Place them under      the oven broiler about four to five inches from the heat      source. (You may have to stick a small metal baking pan      underneath the pepper pan.) Broil for about three or four      minutes, checking so they don't get too black. When they're      mostly blackened, remove from the oven and let cool. Leave      the skins on for storing in the refrigerator or freezer.      Peel off most of the blackened skin when ready to use.</p><p>      <em>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</em> <em><br />      1 large onion, coarsely chopped<br />      1 leek, white part only, rinsed and chopped<br />      4 large cloves garlic, chopped<br />      8 roasted red peppers (24 quarters if they were cut into      fourths)<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste<br />      1/8 teaspoon hot pepper, seeded and chopped (or 1/8      teaspoon cayenne pepper)<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1 can (2 cups) unsalted chicken broth (or vegetable      broth)<br />      3/4 - 1 cup water<br />      1/2 cup skim ricotta cheese</em></p><p> <em>Topping: Chop any of      these herbs or try a combination of basil, dill, chives,      oregano, thyme, Italian parsley</em></p><p> Heat the oil in a      large saucepan, then add the onion and leek. Saute over      medium high heat for a few minutes until they're softened,      stirring frequently. Stir in the garlic for about a minute,      then add the rest of the ingredients except the water and      cheese. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. Pour into a      blender and blend until smooth, adding water until it is      the right consistency. (You may have to blend in batches,      putting the soup in a large bowl then both batches back      into the saucepan.) Blend in the ricotta cheese. Serve as      is or simmer on the stove just until hot. (Don't let it      boil.) Serve with chopped herbs.</p>			<h3>Gazpacho</h3>			<p>      I first started making this chilled soup after my mother      gave me my first natural food cookbook back in the '70s,      <em>The Whole Earth Cookbook.</em> This is a variation of      that recipe. Only tomatoes fresh from the garden will do.</p><p>      <em>1/2</em> <em>teaspoon jalapeno pepper, seeded (wear      rubber gloves) and chopped<br />      2 large cloves garlic<br />      5 - 6 very ripe, medium tomatoes<br />      1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice<br />      1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar<br />      1 teaspoon sugar<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1 cup unsalted chicken broth (or vegetable broth)<br />      1 medium red onion, finely chopped<br />      1 medium poblano or green pepper, cut into a quarter-inch      dice<br />      1 medium cucumber, peeled and chopped into quarter-inch      pieces (not too fat or the cucumber will have large      seeds)<br />      1 -2 tablespoons tomato paste<br />      Possible toppings:<br />      green onion<br />      cilantro, parsley, chives<br />      lowfat yogurt</em></p><p> Fill a large saucepan three-quarters      full with water and bring to a boil. Insert the whole      tomatoes and turn off the heat. Let them set for about two      minutes until the skins have softened. Remove with a      slotted spoon and set aside to cool. When cool enough to      handle, remove the cores and skins of the tomatoes and chop      coarsely. I use a food processor because I don't like large      chunks of tomato but you can also chop them into little      pieces by hand. Mince the jalapeno and garlic in the food      processor. Add all the ingredients up to and including the      ground pepper. Pulse the mixture until the tomatoes are in      little pieces but not pureed. Pour into a mixing bowl and      add the rest of the ingredients. Stir in the tomato paste,      adding more if the soup isn't thick enough. Check to see if      you'd like more salt or hot pepper. Chill for a least one      hour and serve with toppings if you like.</p><p> Note: This soup      is best eaten the same day, but it can be made ahead of      time. I add the cucumber an hour or so before serving      because the salt extracts water from the cucumber and makes      the soup too watery.</p>			<h3>Harvest Chili (Vegan)</h3>			<p>      Don't let all the ingredients scare you-it's really      ready in no time. Too much chili? Freeze some for a later      day.</p><p> <em>1 tablespoon canola or olive oil<br /></em> <em>4      large garlic cloves, minced<br />      1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced (wear rubber      gloves)<br />      1 large onion, chopped fine<br />      1 28-ounce can plum tomatoes in puree<br />      I six-ounce can tomato paste<br />      1 27-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed<br />      2 15-ounce cans black beans, rinsed<br />      2 teaspoons ground cumin<br />      1 teaspoon ground coriander<br />      1 teaspoon allspice<br />      1 teaspoon oregano<br />      2 teaspoons sugar<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br />      4 cups water<br />      1 cup T VP *-optional<br />      1 small eggplant, cut into a half-inch dice<br />      3 medium sweet peppers, (red, green, or yellow) cut into a      half-inch dice<br />      3 medium tomatoes, skinned and chopped into half-inch      chunks<br />      2 cups uncooked corn, cut off the cobs Topping ideas:      yogurt or "lite" sour cream, grated cheddar or jack cheese,      chopped tomato, chopped red or green onion, cilantro</em></p><p>      In a large soup pot, heat the oil and add the garlic,      jalapeno, and onions. Saute over medium-high heat, stirring      frequently, until the onion is limp. Add the rest of the      ingredients except the corn. Reduce heat to a simmer,      cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.      Check to see if there's enough water, add the corn, and      continue to simmer for about 10 minutes or until the      vegetables are tender. Serve in bowls with an assortment of      toppings.</p><p> *Texturized vegetable protein (T.V.P.) is a high      protein meat substitute with a texture similar to      hamburger. The soy product can be purchased at most health      food stores.    </p>
