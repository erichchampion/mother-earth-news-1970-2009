                <p><strong>      SEASONS</strong>    </p>    		<p>      <strong><em>"The fog comes on little cat feet."</em></strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Fred Schaaf    </h5>        <p>      Fog may not seem like the most dramatic of weather      phenomena to study. But if we think for a second we realize      it is the entire background and setting for many a      drama-certainly in spooky movies but also, and more      important, in real life. It is a setter of mood, stirring      various kinds of pondering in people. Unfortunately, it's      also a danger. Late summer and early autumn are famous for      those vast and majestic, but terrible beasts, known as      hurricanes. I wonder, however, if more people have not died      in cars on the roads in thick fog than have been killed in      all hurricanes put together. Fog is beautiful and      evocative, but it is also well to know some things about it      to protect oneself-most notably, of course, when and      where fog is likely to occur.</p><p> Actually, there are many      kinds of fog. You can get fog by suddenly adding moisture      to the air (steam fog or frontal fog). But most of us are      more familiar with fog that occurs when air cools rather      rapidly to the "dew point"-the saturation point of      the air. The temperature doesn't have to drop much after a      heavy rain soaks the ground for fog to materialize (though      often such a rain could be associated with a frontal      passage and brisk wind, which is, of course, fatal to the      formation of fog). On the other hand, in August and      September and for a while into the fall (periodically in      winter), the temperature of a clear calm night may drop      rapidly and enormously-and, if the air is not dry      enough, fog will indeed form.</p><p> If the air temperature drops      to a low enough reading, moisture may instead be deposited      as frost. But it is quite possible to have ice      fogs-in fact, they are common in some climates.</p><p> By      definition, fog occurs when horizontal visibility is less      than 1 kilometer (0.62 mile) and heavy fog when it is less      than 0.4 kilometer (0.25 mile). According to weather      historian and expert David M. Ludlum, the foggiest place on      the U.S. West Coast is Cape Disappointment, Washington, at      the mouth of the Columbia River. It averages 2,552 hours      (which would add up to 106 complete days) of heavy fog a      year. August and September tend to be the foggiest months      of the year there. Pacific coastal locations may have fog      every morning for long stretches in the summer. It is      surprising that in number of days per year of heavy fog,      San Francisco Airport's 18 days ranks behind those of San      Diego and Los Angeles, which have 29 and 47 days,      respectively ...but surely this is a matter of the precise      locations of the airports.</p><p> The windward slopes of mountains      actually produce more frequent fog at some inland locations      than anywhere else. Places in West Virginia experience more      than 100 days a year of heavy fog. On the Atlantic Coast,      the heaviest fog is 1,580 hours a year at Moose Peak      Lighthouse in Maine. Moose Peak Lighthouse is located on      Mistake Island, by the way.</p><p> Fog is "nothing but cloud on      the ground." Nothing but cloud on the ground? But that's an      amazing concept! And more than one poet, amateur and      professional, has written his or her own re action to it,      if less famous than Carl Sandburg's:</p><p> <em>The fog comes on      little cat feet. It sits looking</em> <em>over the harbor      and city on silent haunches and then moves on.</em></p>			<h3>One More Chance to See Comet Hale-Bopp?</h3>			<p>      Comet Hale-Bopp was all that we could wish for this past      spring. Almost everyone saw it and was thrilled by it. But      it was still shining rather brightly back in May when it      began setting too soon after the sun to see any longer.      Now, in August and September, the comet actually emerges      before morning twilight to provide one last view to folks      in the Northern Hemisphere. It may still be bright enough      to glimpse with the naked eye, but it will probably require      binoculars because it will be quite low in the south. So      your best bet is to get details in a magazine like Sky      & Telescope, or seek out your nearest amateur astronomy      club for help.    </p>
