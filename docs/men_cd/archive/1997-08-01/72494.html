            			<p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>		  			<p>			<strong>Learn how to attract butterflies to your flower      patch.</strong>			</p>			      <h5 id="byline">        By Karen B. Smith      </h5>      <p>			Seventh graders weed<br /> and have      fun at the<br /> same time. Placing the<br /> garden next to a fence<br /> is      good for climbing<br /> plants.      </p>        <p>      Just plant it and they WILL come-as if by      magic-a garden of flittering,fluttering butterflies.      Everything I read promised that it was just that easy. My      seventh-grade students and I wanted to build a place where      we could study living insects interacting with their      environment. We had very limited space and, of course, very      limited money, but lots of enthusiasm and free labor. We      did some research, got support from our school      administrator, and wrote a grant request for needed      materials. Now we have a garden of beautiful butterflies to      study in all stages of their life cycle that hundreds of      future seventh graders will enjoy. It really was that      easy-just like magic.    </p><p>Butterflies need the same things that other animals    need-water, shelter, the right temperature, and the    right food. My seventh graders and I designed a garden to    provide survival needs that would attract butterflies.</p>    <p><strong>WATER:</strong>A shallow pan full of soil and water    will allow a butterfly to drink safely without endangering    its fragile wings in the water. Add a couple of rocks where a    butterfly can bask in the summer sunlight. Someone donated a    beat up, old baking pan from their kitchen for our garden and    we ran a sweat hose through the mud in the bot tom of the pan    for water. Your plants will also need lots of water.</p>		<p>    <strong>SHELTER:</strong> Butterflies need protection from    wind, rain, and predators. They often hide in nearby woody    plants like azaleas or trees.</p>            <p>      <strong>FOOD:</strong> Adult butterflies drink the nectar      from sturdy flowers. They prefer tubular flowers (yellow)      in full sun that will support their weight so they can      drink and rest at the same time. Adult butterflies will      also carefully seek the right plant to lay their eggs on so      that the larva will have the right food to eat upon      hatching. If you cultivate the plants needed for larval      food, you will see courting, mating, and egglaying in your      garden. For example, the monarch butterfly lays its eggs on      milkweeds. When the eggs hatch, the tiny caterpillars eat      the milkweed plant. The Gulf Frittilary (also the Zebra      Longwing) butterfly only lays eggs on the passion vine; the      hatching caterpillars eat the leaves of the vine. (Don't      use insecticides even though you will have holes eaten in      your plants! Otherwise, you won't get to see the magical      transformation of a caterpillar "eating" its way into an      adult butterfly.)</p>			<h3>HOW TO DO IT</h3>			<p>      <strong>RESEARCH:</strong> First, go to your local library      and get some books on butterfly gardening. Also contact      your agricultural extension agent, 4-H leader, and your      local garden club for specific (free) information about      your geographical area. The Freshwater Fish and Non-game      Wildlife Commission gave me free materials about Florida      butterflies. Like other animals, butterflies have a      specific geographic range and definite plant preferences      that you must learn about if you wish to attract them. Make      a list of butterflies in your area and the plants that will      attract them. Once you begin asking around, someone will      probably volunteer to give you free transplants from their      garden.    </p>                        <p>      <strong>GET SUPPORT:</strong> If you are working      within an institution, it is essential that you enlist the      enthusiastic support of your administrator and your      groundskeeper. Agree on several different places that a      garden could be located, keeping in mind that sunlight,      water, and not too much wind are essential. Plan how the      garden will be maintained. Talk to parents, students,      businesses, family, and friends about your garden and the      butterflies that are going to come enjoy it.</p><p> <strong>JUST      PLANT:</strong> Assemble materials and sketch out a plan      before the BIG day. Recruit anyone to come, bring tools,      and help plant. Those who work will have a personal      investment in the future of your garden. Now comes the hard      part: waiting for the plants to mature, flower, and attract      butterflies. They will come ...but not by magic.</p>			<p>      <strong>MATERIALS LIST</strong><br />• hand tools, shovel,      rake (loaned or donated)<br />• garden hose and sprinkler      or sweat hose (donated or bought)<br />• fertilizer, peat      (Azalea-Camellia fertilizer with trace elements added)<br />      • list of specific nectar and larval food plants for      the butterflies In your area (may be transplanted, seeds,      or bought)<br />      • list of nearby woody plants to provide shelter (you      may need to buy some if there are no places of shelter      close by)<br />      • shallow pan for watermulch to discourage weed growth<br />      • 14 butterfly field guide (optional)    </p>
