In your      own backyard? We thought so. Building a boat is one of the      truly great fantasies that most grown boys and girls have      indulged in at one time or another. For most of us, it      never gets beyond the dream. Or maybe buying a set of plans      and being thoroughly intimidated by instructions that      begin: "Using the table of offsets, loft the chine...".      Offsets? Loft? What's a chine?    </p>        <p>      Some of us have gone the next step, bought lumber or a kit,      and tried to learn to build a boat the same way we taught      ourselves to garden and build our own houses-by      reading a book or two and then jes' doin' it. But the      boat-building dream dies as our initial enthusiasm is      slowly drained by frustration. Conventionally designed and      built, even a little dingy requires a great deal of time,      specialized tools, and specialized wood crafting skills      that are impossible to invent as you go.</p><p> A landsman's house      or furniture building experience is little help beyond      providing basic tool skills. A boat contains precious few      straight saw cuts. And words like floor, deck and timber,      tiller and sheet-the very term house itself,      even-have different meanings, shapes, and functions      afloat than ashore. And-unlike garden      seeds-chine logs, gunwales, and sheer strakes don't      come in handy packets with instructions printed on the      back.</p>			<h3>Hulls</h3>			<p>For peak efficiency in moving      through its dense, fluid medium, a non-planing      "displacement" (so-called for the amount of water it      displaces or moves aside) is molded into a hydrodynamic      shape that presents the least wetted surface to the water.      So, most boat hulls are shaped like the bottom half of a      fish and are curved in every dimension-front to back,      side to side and top to bottom-all at the same time.    </p>        <p>      Of course, the wood that goes into a boat begins as a pile      of flat, straight boards. Oak timbers must be shaped into a      stout but curved backbone or keel that runs front to back      along the bottom. Smaller but still massive boards are      sawed or steamed into the curved stem up front at the bow.      . . into ribs or timbers that curve up from keel to the      chine along the waterline to the upper margin of the hull      or the sheer ...and into a pointed stem post at the rear of      a canoe or a more-or-less flat transom of a powerboat. The      hull is decked on top and is planked along the sides with      overlapping boards (like clapboards) in the "clinker built"      or lap strake style, or with thick planks that butt along      their long edges with a beveled space between that is      filled with twine-and-putty caulking. Called carvel      planking, this is roughly analogous to squared-log building      construction.</p><p> All these boards, shaped into complex      three-dimensional, multiple-compound curves, must be joined      so precisely that-once they "soak up" enough water to      swell tight-the (appropriately named) vessel will      hold water. Or more precisely, will hold water out. And, it      must remain watertight and sound in an aquatic environment      that is hostile to rottable wood and corrosion prone metals      ...through pounding waves, varying temperatures, sun, snow,      and hard use. . . for decades.</p><p> Shaping boat lumber requires      cutting, bending, steaming, planing, chiseling, fitting,      and fastening that is more precise than the finest      cabinetry. Indeed, straight cut cabinetmaking is a      secondary skill in a boatyard-an afterthought to      finish off fancy yacht interiors.</p>			<h3>...But the Dream      Is Still Possible</h3>			<p> Commercial wooden-boat building      is so skilled-labor intensive and expensive that it's      restricted to owner-built craft and a decreasing number of      luxury yachts-and increasingly, to restoration of      approximately 50-year-old classics: Dodge, Chris-Craft, and      Gar Wood varnished mahogany speedboats; Herreshoff, Scheel      and Alden sailboats; Elco, Owens, and Trojan motor      cruisers.</p><p> Most of this restoration work is being done or      underwritten by handy semi-retirees and hobbyists with the      leisure time and money to take wooden-boat building courses      or spend the many years and many more dollars an amateur      needs to accomplish or hire out the work.</p><p> For those of us      seeking to get out on the water quickly and cheaply,      however, three technological developments have brought      wood-boat construction to everyone. They are [1.] thin,      strong, long life plywood, artificial fabrics, and      composite building materials (which reduce the need for      laborious forming and fitting of most wooden members); [2.]      Two-part resin adhesives and finishes (which reduce the      need for finely fitted, leak-proof joints, for hundreds or      thousands of corrosion-resistant fasteners, and for      continual refinishing and preservative-treatment of wood)      and; [3.] modern multimedia electronics.</p><p> Plywood is made of      thin sheets or veneers of wood shaved from logs and bonded      with waterproof glue in multiple layers with the grain      heading in alternate directions so the sheets are stronger      and more stable than boards several times their thickness.      All but the outer layer of on view plywood sheets can be      made from quick-growing, low-quality lumber so both      environmental and money costs are low. A small boat that      once required 1" thick or larger lumber fastened with      hundreds of rustproof fasteners can now be epoxy'd together      from 1/4" thick ply and the joints bonded and sealed for      all eternity with fiberglass tape and resins. If the entire      hull is covered (or "saturated") with resin and/or a      resin/woven-fabric composite, the plywood can be even      thinner.</p><p> Early fiberglass-reinforced plastic boats and      fiberglass coverings for older wooden hulls were bonded      with polyurethane resins that degrade from UV radiation of      the sun. Over time, they absorb water that forms blisters,      and can pull the plastic away from a wooden hull or      de-laminate fiberglass fabric of fiber mat embedded in it.</p><p>      You can save money by building with poly resins-then      coat with epoxy resin to seal it against water      infiltration. Another option is to build boats entirely      from epoxies or epoxy-bonded composites that will adhere to      anything (other than the polyethylene and polypropylene      used to make containers, packaging film, and a few      fabrics).</p><p> To add strength, any thin but tough sheet goods,      cloth, or loose fiber mat can be encapsulated in it.      Fiberglass is widely used. Dynel is a good fabric choice,      especially for decks and cabin tops. Organic minded boating      experimenters are using lightweight, stronger-than-steel      (natural) silk as well as rayon that's made from cellulose      derived from wood chips.</p><p> But a better reinforcement than      manufactured board or any cloth is plywood. Its relative      rigidity and lateral strength, bend ability, mold-ability,      and large size permit hull, deck, and cabin construction      without the molds needed to lay up a hull from floppy      fabric, or the wooden frames and forms and joining skills      needed to build a plank-on frame hull. Seams can be closed,      and bulkheads, seats, and other interior members can be      bonded permanently with fiberglass tape imbedded in epoxy.</p><p>      Easy but immensely strong joints can be made by      screw-"tacking" or "stitching" panels together with wire or      tape ...then mixing wood flour with resins and troweling      the putty into joints and smoothing it into smooth fillets.      This "tack & glue" or "stitch & glue" construction      eliminates the laborious wood joinery that takes such skill      and time. Then, if the ply and trim are all "saturated"      with an epoxy covering, the structure becomes a monolithic      whole-and, if designed well, will behave as if it had      been molded all in one piece.</p><p> The design and hand skills      needed for plywood/resin boat construction are not only      less demanding than plank or fabric construction, they are      being made available via electronic devices you can employ      at home ...through CAD, computer-assisted design of hulls,      sails, and more, in seamanship, as well as navigating      computer programs, and instruction on CDs, in how-to videos      and in (real time) discussion groups and instruction on the      Internet. Seamanship, boat handling, and coastal and      inshore navigation remain essential, hard-won practical      skills, but offshore navigation has been automated by      global positioning satellites. A little $200 handheld GPS      receiver will instantly pinpoint your location within a few      feet anywhere on the globe.</p><p> And, most important to      traditionalists, plywood/resin composite boats have all the      warm beauty of wood grain, plus a forgiving ride that comes      only from a hull with the organic flexibility and holistic      integrity of wood. Even encapsulated in resins, wood hulls      "just feel right" on the water.</p>			<h3>Constructing Puddle      Duck</h3>			<p> Puddle Duck incorporates design elements of      the Native American canoe, Louisiana pirouge, Maine dory      and Cape Cod sailing catboat. Still, her construction is      simplicity itself-a hybrid of old-time wood and      super-modern "tack & glue" construction. Requiring only      three 15' plus long plywood panels cut and spliced (scarfed      is the correct term) from two 4'x8', 1/4." plywood sheets      and a few cedar and pine boards, the hull can be drawn out      full-size ( lofted ) from the plan, cut and fastened around      conventional wooden boat structural members, and bonded      with quick-setting epoxy resins and fiberglass tape in as      few as six hours. Finishing will take a bit      longer-but a single amateur boat builder can arrange      a workspace Thursday evening, bring home wood, epoxy, and      paint Friday after work, get up early for a day of      boat-building on Saturday and be showing a youngster how to      fish Sunday afternoon.</p>			<h3>Preliminaries</h3>			<p>      Before even purchasing your materials (see "Materials List"      on 163-083-01 ) and assembling tools (see "Tools" on      163-086-01 ), you will need to locate a workspace that is      at least 3' larger all around than the boat. If you are      building indoors, be sure doors and passageways are      adequate for you to remove the boat once it is finished.      Adaptable to paddle, oars, sail, or motor power, PuddleDuck      is a flexible little craft, but she won't bend around      corners.</p>			<h3>Lofting & Cutting Hull Panels</h3>        <p>      Lay out the ply on a flat surface with the best-finished      sides facing up and sheets laid short-edge-to short-edge.      With tape or tack nailed boards, secure the joint between      sheets temporarily but securely; draw several pencil lines      across the seam to make precise rejoining easy.    </p><p>With a true straightedge or snapped chalk line, mark a    line down the center of the 16' dimension of the joined    sheets. This will be the centerline of the bottom of the    boat.</p>		<h3>Sides</h3>		<p>Along one long edge of the    short-edge-butted ply, use measurements from the flat plan to    mark out the "offsets"-the height of hull sides above    the chine (bottom edge) from bow to stern at each station.</p><p>    Set your long fairing batten on edge so it describes a fair    curve that touches each of the points you've marked. If need    be, set temporary drywall screws into the ply to hold the    batten in place.</p><p> Sight along the batten to assure the curve    is even-without dips or bumps. Then, draw the    sheer-the fair-curve line describing the upper edge, or    sheer, of the hull.</p><p> Set ply on wood strips so the saw won't    cut into the floor. A scant 1/8" inch outside of the line,    cut out the first side of the boat from the two adjoining    sheets of ply; flip them over lengthwise (so upper sides are    facing down). Slide them across the sheet so their bottoms    line up with the other long edge of the re-butted sheets of    plywood. Use hull sides already cut as templates to mark and    cut out other side. Set aside.</p>		<h3>Bottom</h3>		<p>    Re-butt the ply sheets and draw offsets from the centerline    (as indicated on the plan) for each half of the bottom. Set    temporary screws as needed to describe the curved edges of    the bottom panel. Use the fairing batten to mark even curves    describing both sides of the hull bottom. Be sure curves are    equidistant from the centerline all along the bottom. Cut out    the bottom panels.</p>		<h3>Scarf Panels Together</h3>		<p> To    join the halves of the sides and bottom, you must scarf them    together, making a sound, watertight joint that is as strong    as the plywood itself. There are two ways:</p><p> [ 1.] True scarf    joint. Here, you plane and sand perfect, long, wedge shapes    into the edges of sheets and epoxy and tape them together on    what will be the inside and outsides of the boat, then fill    and sand the joint smooth so they won't show when painted.</p><p>    [2.] Butt-Block, where you join the raw edges under a thin,    wood butt strip running the width of the joint, and then    epoxy and tape both sides.</p>		<h3>The Scarfing Rule</h3>		<p>    A scarf-wedge should measure eight to 12 units of horizontal    run for each unit of height. With 1/4" plywood 8:1 is    adequate, so you need to make a 2" deep scarf wedge running    the length of both meeting edges. You can try to plane them    individually, but this takes practice. Easier (and acceptable    for PuddleDuck because you can fill mistakes with epoxy) is    to stack the panels and cut them down all at once. (See    illustration.)</p><p> Place the two halves of the bottom and the    halves of each side together with good sides of the ply    facing. Put one set of side panels on top of the other.</p><p> Align    the two piles along the margin of a wooden surface you can    drill into (an expendable-but unwarped-sheet of    plywood is best). Stack so the edge of the bottom panel is    even with the margin of the support below. Make back-slanting    piles-so succeeding boards stacked above are set two    inches back from the edge of the board below. You will end up    with two stacks: one stack of four side half-panels an 1"    high and with 8" to be planed down, and another stack of two    bottom panels a 1/2" high with 4" to be planed.</p><p> Temporarily    screw panels together and to the wood surface below. Draw a    line 2" behind and parallel to the leading edge of the top    panel in each stack. Draw lines down both side-faces of the    stack from that line forward to the front-bottom of the    stack. The wedge below is your scarf, the reverse wedge above    is to be removed.</p><p> Now, with a block plane taking very shallow    bites, plane off as much wood as you can. The plywood will    reveal a series of color bands as you plane down; keep them    evenly spaced and of equal width all along will assure    accuracy. Finish with sandpaper stretched and stapled over a    foot-long 2x4. Sand until you have an even wedge all along.    Be especially careful not to chip the narrow edge of the    wedge out at the lip of the support.</p>		<h3>Join Halves of    Sides and Bottom</h3>                            <p>      To join, flip one half of each pair along the scarf line,      align on a drillable surface with two sheets of      common kitchen wax paper under the joints. Be sure the      centerline of bottom panels is straight and that the bottom      of both halves of sides make a straight line.    </p><p>Mix epoxy according to container directions. (For small    jobs like this, you can use quick-setting resin that hardens    in seven minutes.) Fill joint with epoxy, cover with wax    paper, place a 6" wide strip of scrap over the joint and    press with concrete blocks or screw through scrap and boat    side panels to base every 3" along both sides of the joint.</p>		<h3>Butt-Board Joint</h3>		<p> Here, you don't take time    to bevel edges, but butt them together and epoxy with a strip    of ply over the joint to serve as a reinforcement.</p><p> Set halves    together so bottom edges of each pair of side panels is    straight, and bottom halves are arranged so the center line    is straight. Place epoxy in the joint and press together so    halves are perfectly aligned and the wedges mated to re-form    a perfect 1/4" thickness all along. Cut a bandage-a 6"    wide strip of scrap 1/4" ply (or-better-apiece of 1/8" or    even thinner ply if you have it). Cover bandage liberally    with epoxy, press onto joint, and weight or screw-clamp as    described above. When cured, remove screws and tape each edge    of the bandage-joint. (Taping is described below.)</p>		<h3>Make Stem and Sternpost</h3>		<p> The stem is the long    wedge shaped piece of wood that joins front ends of the two    hull panels at the bow. The sternpost is the equivalent at    the back for this canoesterned craft. (If you plan to mount    an outboard motor on your PuddleDuck, you will want a square    transom at the rear. But, finish off the boat as a    doubleender first to get alignment of sides and bottom    correct. You needn't add the end cap to the stern.)</p><p> End    members are sawn from 24"-plus lengths of ordinary 2x4. (See    the illustrations.) Make the angled sides perfectly flat and    even all along. But do not sand smooth. Leave the surfaces    rough to provide a good-adhering base for the epoxy.</p>		<h3>Fabricate Built-Up Center Frame</h3>		<p> As    illustrated, make the frame from a sandwich of wood stock and    plywood cutouts. Cut the notches at each side of the bottom    of the frame to snugly hold your strip-stock (which will form    chines).</p><p> To assemble, apply epoxy liberally around rim of one    plywood cutout. Fasten to wood strips with screws through ply    and into wood. Be sure outer edges remain aligned (epoxy is    sneakily slippery under clamp pressure). When first side is    set, remove screws and repeat to attach other ply cutout to    other side of frame boards. With plane and a long sanding    block, trim all four edges to be straight and square across.    Clamp frame securely to your center sawhorse. Use the spirit    level to be sure the frame sides are parallel and that the    top is level. Set the other sawhorses about 8' to each side    of the first horse (see sequence of illustrations on page 86,    which details assembly steps).</p><p> Fasten stem and stern post to    side panels.</p>            <p>      Epoxy stem and sternpost to one side (or stem to one side      panel and the sternpost to the other). Align front of post      with cutting line of the bow drawn on ply. Leave several      inches of 2-by scrap above and below side panel.</p>			<h3>Attach Sides to Frame</h3>			<p> Set sides on central      sawhorse. Arrange other two horses at each end so they      support sides so that bottoms are level. Adjust so that the      central frame meets sides at the center of each side panel.      Using your square, align the long "H" made by the two sides      and the built-up frame so that frame is perfectly      perpendicular to both side panels.</p><p> Using slow (20-minute)      set epoxy, and temporary screws through sides into frame,      fasten frame to sides. Adjust so bottom of cutout line on      frame panels is even with upper surface of frame. Let set      up good.</p>			<h3>Close Ends</h3>			<p> Using your batten,      define the centerline of the boat (perfectly perpendicular      to frame) and mark on end sawhorses. Test close ends over      the centerline, tacking side panels to stem and stern      posts. Place bottom panel loosely on sides and adjust side      panels on horses till the bottom fits perfectly. Use clamps      or glued-on blocks to make sure sides stay put on horses.      (Weight horses if they want to slip.)</p><p> Remove the bottom      sheet and epoxy ends of sides to stem and sternpost.</p>			<h3>Attach Chines</h3>			<p> Set your strip-stock into      notches in frame, cutting notches to size if need be so      that chine logs rest level with frame bottom and cutout      lines on side panels. Tack in place. Bend chines to fit      along cutout lines of sides, whittling ends as needed to      fit snugly against the inboard faces of the end posts.      Using slow-set epoxy, tackscrew through ply into chine      ...always keeping chine even with cutout lines.</p>			<h3>Attach End Caps</h3>			<p> Using a sanding block,      sand front and rear edges of side panels even with end      posts. Epoxy on end caps.</p>			<p> <strong>Sand Chines Flat</strong></p>			<p>      Trim projecting lower ends of stem and stern post even with      side panels. With your plane and a yard-long sanding block      that reaches across the bottom, sand edges of both side      panels and the chine log affixed to their insides till the      surfaces are flat, level from side to side, and the flat      surfaces fairly curved so that bottom will have a fiat,      firm attachment.    </p>		<h3>Attach Bottom</h3>        <p>      Use your thickest epoxy and have handy a good      supply of disposable miniscrapers to collect or spread out      resin that drips down from the long seam between bottom and      chine. Good to use are 1 "x2" rectangles of light      non-corrugated cardboard (such as those packed inside new      shirts). Cut a lot of them and have an ample-sized, handily      placed container to toss them in so they don't get on the      floor and stick to your shoes. (Or you can stick on strips      of masking tape and sheets of newspaper to catch drips.)      Set bottom atop sides so that it covers the entire      perimeter with a bit of overlap all around. Check and      adjust that all is fair, evenly sheer, and properly      aligned. Remove bottom.</p><p> Apply a liberal coat of slow-set      epoxy to up-facing surface all around side panels and chine      logs and across the bottom of the center frame. Using a      helper here if nowhere else, lay on bottom panel, align and      tack-screw at midpoint of frame. Then, beginning in the      center, set tack- screws through bottom into chines of both      sides. Alternate tack-screwing from side to side and front      to back.</p><p> From time to time, duck under the boat and spread      out or collect drips. Blobs are hard to remove once set.      Wear a knitted cap to keep the stuff out of your hair. (A      helper is nice to have at this point as well.)</p>			<h3>Trim      Bottom</h3>			<p> When epoxy is set, use plane, wood rasp,      and sanding blocks (or a router if you have one) to trim      the outer rim of the bottom panel even with angle of sides.    </p>		<p><strong>		Taping</strong>		</p>        <p>      Coat insides and outsides of all joints with      slow-set epoxy, embed in it a length of fiberglass tape,      then immediately cover tape with more epoxy. Add more coats      till smooth. This applies to insides and outsides of bows      and sterns, to seam where side and bottom panels join, down      inner and outer seam between bottom and sides, to seams of      proper scarf joints, to both sides of a butt-board scarf      and all around the central frame.</p><p> Fiberglass tape is stiff      and does not want to bend. So cut and fit all tape lengths      dry-before applying epoxy. You can cut      darts-small notches or slits-to persuade it to      bend. It will stretch to a degree as well. You may find      that creasing a length of tape will help fit it into or      over a sharp angle.</p><p> Plan to encapsulate all your tape in      epoxy and paint over it-so it won't show. Then you      can work with small lengths and not worry about having      piecework on display. Overlap joints if piecing tape.</p><p> When      setting tape into epoxy, try not to go over it more than      once or twice with the scraper. You can pull and stretch      it, which can make edges curl.</p><p> Heating the tape with a      torch can make it flexible, but use care. You want to warm,      not melt it.</p>			<h3>SOURCE LIST</h3>			<p>      <strong>Publications:</strong></p><p> Wooden Boat Magazine, P.O.

Use a wooden tongue depressor to mix the material      and ladle it into the angle of the joint. Then smooth it      with a plastic spoon-finish smoothing just as the epoxy      begins to set.</p><p> To "stitch & glue" a joint, drill small      holes through butting plywood sheets. Run brass wire      through the holes and use pliers to twist-tighten this      temporary clamp. Apply a fillet inside the joint, remove      wire, and tape outside of the joint.</p>			<h3>Turn      boat</h3>			<p> You can turn the boat when bottom and ends      are taped and sides "saturated" if you want to do all the      bottom work at once-but be sure to remove fasteners      holding frame to center horse.</p><p> Block up bow and stern to      work on the turned hull at floor level. Or attach blocks to      horses to hold it steady at the waist-high work level.</p>			<h3>Transom</h3>			<p> If you want a square-sterned      PuddleDuck, don't tape and epoxy on the sternpost. Decide      how much transom width your outboard will need and draw the      shape on each side of the boat. It can be as narrow as 6"      and accommodate a small electric motor. And, though (for      clarity) the illustration shows the entire stern lopped      off, you can design a gracefully angled, hour-glass transom      that just nips off the sharp edge of the canoe stern.</p><p>      Working inside, measure, cut, and epoxy on lengths of strip      stock to frame the transom. Be sure to fasten an upper      frame member before trimming off the side panels to retain      hull shape.</p><p> Trim off canoe end with a saber saw.</p><p> Using      plane and sanding block, square boards so ends of side      panels and frame members form a flat plane. This needn't be      a perfect job of woodworking, as all will be covered and      bonded in place with resin. But transom must be square      across in all dimensions to look its best.</p><p> Transom boards      are the one part of a painted boat that should be stained      and left natural if at all possible. A single thickness of      plywood will do, since most of the transom area is filled      with frame boards. Trace pattern on cardboard held against      the rear of the boat. Cut out transom with a bit to spare.      Tack-screw and epoxy in place. Sand edges even with side      and bottom.</p><p> Put wood filler in tack-screw holes when they      are removed after epoxy is set up. Before finishing the      rest of the boat, sand and stain the transom and give it      several coats of thin epoxy till it is glassy smooth. Cover      the transom with masking tape and paper to protect it while      you finish the boat.</p><p> For best appearance, tape the transom      seams from the inside only. Name the boat and paint in      gold-leaf the name on the transom.    </p>                            <h3>Trim Stem, etc.</h3>			<p> With a thin saw, trim      even stem or stern post scrap that juts beyond the sides.      Or, as illustrated, round one or both and drill through to      use hole mooring lines.</p><p> Tape inside hull/bottom seams,      attach seat-holding cleats and accessories to sides and      bottom. Saturate inside with resin mix</p>			<h3>Make      Decks</h3>			<p> For cosmetic value and to hide flotation,      you should fashion decks fore and aft. A 12" to 18"-long      deck at bow of all versions, and at bow and stern of canoes      will look fine.</p><p> Slapping a plywood deck on top of the bow      will make your rub rail look peculiar. Better is to trace      out a template to make an inset deck: an arrow tip-shaped      piece of Y4" ply that fits down in between the peak made by      the stem and side panels. Set a pair of cleats on the inner      surface of both side panels at the bow peaks. . . X" down      from the top edge and parallel to the gunwale. Epoxy cleats      in place, then epoxy deck to cleats. Sand even all around      and epoxy smooth.</p>			<h3>Flotation</h3>			<p> You can make a      vertical bulkhead to create a flotation chamber or a      watertight compartment under the the deck. Make a cardboard      template to shape sections of thin plywood to meet hull      sides and un derside of deck. Install vertical cleats on      both (in)sides of the hull to support it. Fill the space      under the deck with any flotation you have at hand.</p><p> Fill      the space with an old inner tube. Or, this is a good way to      get rid of that noxious solid-styrofoam packaging that      every half-fragile product comes in these days. It is nasty      stuff to cut with anything but a hot knife or cool      soldering iron and leaves little white balls sticking to      everything with static electricity. But, cut pieces to fit      and glue them in place with (non-expanding) foam      insulation. Use the foam to fill all empty spaces and      foam-fill out to the bulkhead that will close the      compartment. Once hard, the foam can be trimmed, so you can      install the bulkhead flush with it. Epoxy the bulkhead in      place.</p><p> At the rear of a transom-type PuddleDuck, you will      be installing an outboard motor, a sculling oar, or rudder.      If it won't interfere with these accessories, build in a      rear deck/flotation compartment of similar size and      construction as the front deck. Only its top shape will      differ. To accommodate outboard attachment screws, install      the deck 4" down from the gunwales. Or fashion a 4" deep      tray at the back of a flush deck (with drain holes out      through the transom).</p><p> For these and any other through-hull      fitting (such as for tiller ropes of a rudder) epoxy in      lengths of smooth plastic tubing to serve as thimbles or      fairleads to keep rope from chafing. PVC plumbing pipe or      the little cream-colored connectors for smaller-diameter      pipe are good.</p><p> If epoxied carefully, the deck/bulkhead will      form a watertight compartment. Leave out the flotation and      install a deckplate-a removable air and water-tight      hatch you can buy at any marine supply outlet. Then use the      compartment to store lines and gear. </p>			<h3>Rub Rail,      Keel, and Beach Runners</h3>			<p> Finally, fit and epoxy      strip-stock rub rails around each gunwale edge. Sand outer      face and top surface before attaching. As with the bottom,      start at the middle and work to the ends, alternating epoxy      applications and tack-fasteners from side to side and front      to back. Keep your drip catchers handy.</p><p> The transom version      should have a skeg at the after end of the keel built up      from 3" boards or cedar strip-stock. See plan; the keel      should be screw-fastened or through bolted to hull, then      epoxy-taped in place. For frequent beaching, a pair of wood      wear rails from strip-stock should also be installed on the      bottom at each side of the keel. Cover keel and beach      runners with fiberglass tape and epoxy for longest life.</p><p>      For the best job, the final layer of keel and a cap on      beach runners can be strips of plain wood screwed but not      epoxied in place. These boards can be replaced when they      wear.</p>			<h3>Seat Options</h3>			<p> The boat is too small      and low-sided for proper thwart-seats. You need to keep      your weight down to maintain a low center of gravity and      good balance. PuddleDuck is really made for paddlers who      can spend long periods sitting cross-legged or on their      knees. A square boat cushion is more than adequate as      either seat or knee-rest. Best for relaxed sailing or      power-boating are old fashioned legless canoe-chairs with      woven cane seats and folding backs.</p><p> If you are long-legged      and find the central frame gets in the way of comfortable      seating, you can saw out the cross-member. Reinforce half      frames by making and epoxying on four " knees"-lazy      "L"-shaped pieces of ply 6" long on each leg-to each      side of both bottom-angles of the frame. Keep the sawn-out      cross member though and clamp it back in place to retain      hull shape while boat is in storage over winter.</p>			<h3>Finish Options</h3>			<p> For longest life, coat      every square inch with epoxy. To protect the resin from the      sun's UV rays, paint inside and out. (See "Materials List"      on 163-083-01 for more information.)</p>			<h3>End Note</h3>			<p> Pick your choice(s) in power from the      companion article on page 64. Get a Coast Guard approved      vest-type life preserver (a PFD or Personal Flotation      Device) to fit every boater, and take your new craft to the      nearest protected water for a test run. She'll float in 6"      of water, bounce off logs and mossy rocks with no damage,      and will hold 250 pounds easily. But don't overload her or      try navigating rough water. With flotation bow and stern      she won't sink, but her low sides and minimal freeboard      will let her ship water in any kind of sea, or if you heel      over too far on a sailing tack or "catch a crab" by letting      the water grab a paddle or oar left in the water too long.
