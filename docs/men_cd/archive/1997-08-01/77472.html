The trail hugs the crests      of the Appalachian Mountains and is open only to hikers.      Shelters are spaced for convenient overnight stays. The      Appalachian Trail Conference, established in 1925,      developed the trail and maintains it today through      affiliated volunteer trail clubs. Only 65 miles still need      protection through public ownership. More than 200 people      each year hike the entire trail, while millions find      inspiration and adventure on shorter trips along the "A.T."</p><p>      Contact: Appalachian Trail Conference, PO.

It is the most      rugged of the longdistance trails. The only section      officially designated runs for 795 miles from Canada      through Montana and Idaho to Yellowstone National Park It      is open to hikers, pack and saddle animals, and in some      places, off road motorized vehicles. Some segments are open      for use in other states.</p><p> Contact: Continental Divide Trail      Society, 3704 N.

Much is already in      place: the 184-mile towpath of the Chesapeake and      Ohio Canal in the District of Columbia and Maryland, the      18-mile Mount Vernon Trail in Virginia, and the 75-mile      Laurel Highlands Trail in Pennsylvania. In western      Maryland, members of the Potomac Heritage Trail Association      have recommended a 55-mile hiking path from Cumberland,      Maryland, north to Pennsylvania's Mount Davis and on to the      Laurel Highlands.</p><p> Contact: National Park Service, National      Capital Region, Land Use Coordination, 1100 Ohio Drive SW,      Washington, D.C. 20242;(202)819-7027.</p><p> <strong>Natchez Trace      National Scenic Trail</strong></p><p> Jurisdiction: National Park      Service<br />      Established: 1983<br />      Route: 110 miles (180 km)</p><p> The Natchez Trace National Scenic      Trail lies within the boundaries of the Natchez Trace      Parkway, extending for 450 miles from Natchez, Mississippi,      to Nashville, Tennessee. The Parkway commemorates the      historic Natchez Trace, an ancient path that began as a      series of animal tracks and Native American trails. It was      later used by early explorers, "Kaintuck" boatmen, post      riders, and military men, including General Andrew Jackson      after his victory at the Battle of New Orleans. In the      trail's 1987 comprehensive plan, four segments near      Nashville, Jackson, and Natchez totaling 110 miles were      selected for development as hiking and horseback trails.</p><p>      Contact: Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail, 2680 Natchez      Trace Pkwy., Tupelo, MS 38801; (601) 680-4004.</p><p>      <strong>North Country National Scenic Trail</strong></p><p>      Jurisdiction: National Park Service<br />      Established: 1980<br />      Route: Originally estimated at 3,200 miles (5,150 km), now      estimated as long as 4,400 miles!</p><p> Conceived in the      mid-1960s, the North Country Trail links New York's      Adirondack Mountains with the Missouri River in North      Dakota. The trail journeys through a variety of      environments: the grandeur of the Adirondacks,      Pennsylvania's hardwood forests, the farmland and canals of      Ohio, the Great Lakes shorelines of Michigan, the      glacier-carved forests, lakes, and streams of northern      Wisconsin and Minnesota, and the vast plains of North      Dakota. Today more than half this trail is open for public      use. Some of the longer segments cross nine national      forests and two national park areas along the route.</p><p>      Contact: National Park Service, North Country National      Scenic Trail, 700 Rayovac Dr., Suite 100, Madison, WI      53711;(608)264-5610.    </p>    <h3>Trail Ethics</h3>    <p>      Treat the land the Trail crosses and its neighbors with      respect and care. Keep to the Trail's defined footway:      shortcuts cause erosion, damage endangered plants, confuse      other hikers, and may violate property rights. Use log      walkways, steps, rock treadway, and other protective trail      construction. Do not walk or camp on balds or fragile      tundra vegetation in areas above treeline. Ask for      information and water from homes along the Trail only when      they are really needed. Respect the privacy of Trail      neighbors-some get more hiker-visitors than they      enjoy. Travel in groups of 10 or fewer if backpacking; 25      or fewer on day trips. Dispose of human waste at least 50      feet from the Trail and 200 feet from water. Dig a shallow      hole and cover it afterwards. Do not wash in lakes or      streams. Use a camping stove instead of building fires.      Leave your campsite cleaner than you found it. By leaving      little or no trace of your presence, you help preserve the      Trail for future enjoyment. And remember: millions of hours      have been donated by volunteers to build and maintain the      Trails, most at their own expense.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail</strong></p><p>      Jurisdiction: Forest Service<br />      Established: 1968<br />      Route: 2,638 miles (4,247 km)</p><p> ILLUSTRATION</p><p> Lying along the      spectacular shoulders of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada      mountain ranges from Canada to Mexico, the Pacific Crest is      the West Coast counterpart of the Appalachian Trail.      Inspired in the 1930s by the idea of a long-distance      mountain trail, citizen activists worked with the Forest      Service to establish the trail. It passes through 25      national forests and seven national parks. The trail was      completed in Oregon and Washington in 1987. Today only 30      miles in California are not protected.</p><p> Contact: USDA Forest      Service, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, PO.

Kern, who      formed the Florida Trail Association in 1964. The trail      will eventually extend from Big Cypress National Preserve      in South Florida through Florida's three national forests      to Gulf Islands National Seashore in the western panhandle.      It is especially delightful for winter hiking and camping,      passing through America's only subtropical landscape. Side      loop trails connect to nearby historic sites and other      points of interest. When completed the trail will run for      about 1,300 miles. Some 700 miles are officially open to      public use.</p><p> Contact: Florida Trail Association, P.O.

In Wisconsin, this band of      hills zigzags across the state for 1,000 miles from Lake      Michigan to the Saint Croix River. A trail along these      hills was conceived by Ray Zillmer in the 1950s and      publicized by Rep. Henry Reuss in his book, <em>On the      Trail of the Ice Age</em> . Today, with help from the state      of Wisconsin and the Ice Age Park and Trail Foundation,      almost half of the trail is open to public use. Certain      sections are popular for marathons, ski races, and      ultra-running.</p><p> Contact: National Park Service, Ice Age      National Scenic Trail. 700 Rayovic Dr., Suite 100, Madison,      WI 53711; (608) 264-5610.</p><p> <em>Maps and some trail      information excerpted from</em> <em>Trails Across America      by Arthur P.
