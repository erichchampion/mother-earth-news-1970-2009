                <p>      <strong>Earth Diary</strong>    </p>        <p>      Stop Junk Mail Forever Direct mail marketers take in      billions each year by sending you pitches and promos you      didn't ask for. Here's how to strike back and end the      "great paper waste".    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Marc Eisenson    </h5>        <p>      Every American, on average, receives 677 sales pitches in      his or her mailbox every year-thanks to low-cost,      third-class postal rates. While the direct mailers who      produce and distribute those 40 million tons of sales      pitches take in over $200 billion annually, taxpayers bear      the burden of some $320 million to cart their unsolicited      promos, pleas, and promises to and from incinerators,      garbage dumps (on land and sea), and recycling centers.      Sixty-eight million trees and 28 billion gallons of water      (and the animals who lived there) are used to produce each      year's crop of catalogs and come-ons. Nearly half get      trashed unopened.    </p>    <p>      Many of the environmental organizations that you'd expect      to speak up for the trees, rivers, and wildlife are silent      about junk mail. Why? Because they support themselves just      like the other mailbox fishermen do ...by casting an      extremely wide net to catch a couple of fish. A "response      rate" of 1% or 2%-that's 1 or 2 of every 100 pieces      mailed-is considered typical, no matter if the mailer      is a worthy charity. . . or the distributor of yet one more      vegetable slicer.    </p>    <p>      There's another issue of great concern to us: Privacy. We      think Americans should have the right to choose how      personal information about them is marketed, if at all.      What follows are some clear instructions on how to keep      your name, business, address, and other personal      information, private-off of those thousands upon thousands      of mailing lists that are regularly bought and sold,      without our approval, for pennies a name.    </p>    <p>      But the privacy implications go well beyond junk mail.      Until recently, anyone who wanted to find you-be it a      bill collector, abusive spouse, or crazed      stalker-could walk into your old post office, after      you'd moved, and get your new address. All that was      required was $3 and presentation of your former address.      Finally realizing this danger, the U.S. Postal Service is      changing the regulation that allows such easy access to      your new address. But in many states, it remains nearly as      simple to find you from your motor vehicle records.    </p>    <h3>      Whoever Profits Should Pay the Costs    </h3>    <p>      Direct-mail advertisers and the Post Office say that      third-class/bulk rates are calculated to compensate the      Post Office for its costs of handling and delivery. We're      told that first-class stamp buyers like us (we never ship      third class) "don't subsidize waste mail," as one postal      official calls it. Perhaps that's true. I'm not convinced.    </p>    <p>      A solution might be the idea of      "solidwaste-management rates" for junk mail, which      were first proposed by Richard Bossert, of New York's      Consumer Protection Board (R. Kessel, Chair). These rates      would cover the full costs of delivery and      disposal-with enough extra tossed in to pay for      environmental damage.    </p>    <p>      We believe that caring, direct mailers who use a more      carefully focused marketing strategy, rather than the      current scatter-shot approach, can create more jobs,      satisfy more customers, and earn more ...while protecting      the planet.    </p>    <h3>      Name Game    </h3>    <p>      If you've ever bought anything through the mail-a      magazine, a pair of slippers, a ream of paper for the      office, or a packet of seeds-chances are the company      that you patronized increased its profits by renting,      selling, or trading your name, as well as other pertinent,      personal information about you.    </p>    <p>      Here's how it works: Say you buy something from a      mail-order firm we'll call Trinkets for Tots, whose catalog      features items to keep preschoolers amused. Trinkets for      Tots sends you what you ordered and adds your name to its      customer list. Through a member of the vast listbrokering      industry, your name is rented for what's called, "a      one-time use," to other-usually related, but not      directly competitive companies (such as mailorder suppliers      of kids' clothes).    </p>    <p>      And if you've ever given money to a cause or charity      ...watch out! For example, people who've donated to      conservative causes wind up in "politically conservative      direct-mail donors" files. Broader based givers can be      targeted through "Donoreach," which offers some 12 million      names "that can be selected by type of cause and even      multidonors to the same or different causes." The 2.2      million contributors to the Muscular Dystrophy Association      and its annual telethon are sold on lists "enhanced with      exact age, income, and 26 mail-response-interest      categories to help you target your best prospects,"      according to Donoreach.    </p>    <p>      No luck? maybe it's time for an "improved species of new      donors"-the American Museum of Natural History's      list-"they'll contribute to anything...," the ad      says.    </p>    <p>      The more targeted the list of names, the higher the price      it commands. For example, R.L. Polk, a giant in the      listbrokering field, charges $40 per thousand for its      "Household List" (79 million names). But Polk's more      specific "New Mover List" goes for $130 per thousand, based      on the assumption that they are hot prospects for      businesses like insurance brokers, restaurants, and      furniture stores. Once a mailing-list broker gets your      name, it can be sold to literally hundreds of      organizations.    </p>    <p>      As computers make it easier to collect more information      about more people and more businesses, the number of      organizations you have to ask to STOP sending you stuff      seems to increase exponentially. R.L. Polk says that its      lists are developed by the "merging of 22 sources, totaling      more than 1.8 billion records annually."    </p>    <p>      As the U.S. Post Office reports in "The Small Business      Direct Mail Guide," which it puts out to encourage more      junk mail:    </p>    <p>      "Direct- mail lists are compiled in hundreds of ways from      numerous sources, ranging from voter registrations to      attendees of trade shows, from the neighbors of your      existing customers to people buying similar      products/services."    </p>        <h3>      The One-Shot SemiSolution    </h3>    <p>      The quickest way to have your name and address removed from      many-but by no means, all-lists is through the      Mail Preference Service, sponsored by the Direct Marketing      Association (DMA).    </p>    <p>      When you request this trade organization's free service,      include your name and address-in all the various ways      they appear on the junk mail you receive. Send your      postcard to:    </p>    <p>      Mail Preference Service<br /> Direct Marketing Association<br /> PO.      Box 9008<br /> Farmingdale, NY 11735<br /> 212-768-7277    </p>    <p>      Your name and address will be registered on DMNs "Delete      File," which is reportedly used by the majority of this      organization's 3,600 members, who receive it four times a      year (January, April, July, and October). So it could take      three months or more for your wishes to be acted upon.    </p>    <p>      Once your name makes it to the "Delete File," it will      remain there for five years-unless, of course, you      order something else and forget to say, "Please do not      sell, rent, or trade my name."    </p>    <p>      Place a new order, or request a catalog, and-unless      you say those magic words to an outfit that respects your      rights-your name, address, and mountains of other      personal statistics will again be fair game, as your      mailbox will soon attest.    </p>    <p>      Even if you're careful, unless our nation comes up with a      better system, you'll need to recontact the Mail Preference      Service every five years, to continue your respite from the      junk-mail lists that DMA members control.    </p>    <h3>      And Now for the Rest of the Story    </h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, although "business-to-business" junk mail      accounts for about 25% of third-class mail, it's not      covered by the Mail Preference Service. In fact, only about      70% of national direct marketers subscribe to DMA's Mail      Preference Service. Nonprofit organizations, political      groups, and local marketers generally don't subscribe at      all.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, to really stop junk mail, you'll also need to:    </p>    <p>      1. Contact all the organizations whose mailings you'd      rather not receive-at home or at the office-and      tell them to remove you from their data bases.    </p>    <p>      2. Be very careful about giving out your name, business,      address, and phone number. When you do give them out, make      sure to request that your name be placed on an "in-house      list ...only."    </p>    <p>      3. Avoid the U.S. Post Office's change-of-address system      when moving.    </p>    <p>      4. Consider getting an unlisted telephone number.    </p>    <p>      In our view, a little duplication in the pursuit of a      solution to this problem is no vice. The more we all get      the message across-that direct mailers should target      their lists far more carefully and be more environmentally      sensitive to their customer's wishes-the better.    </p>    <h3>      The Big (Bad?) List Brokers    </h3>    <p>      To get out of the biggest list brokers' data bases, send      your name, address, and phone number to the following four      organizations. Request that your personal information be      removed from all their mailing and telemarketing lists.    </p>    <p>      R. L. Polk & Co.-"Name Deletion File"<br /> List      Compilation and Development<br /> 6400 Monroe Boulevard<br /> Taylor,      MI 48180-1814<br /> 800-873-7655    </p>    <p>      Donnelley Marketing, Inc.<br /> Data Base Operations<br /> 1235 N.

They      won't respond to individual requests.    </p>    <h3>      Credit-Bureau Lists    </h3>    <p>      TRW, Equifax, and Trans Union are the three largest credit      bureaus in the United States. They're the ones who gather      the information that lenders use to decide whether or not      to approve your credit and loan applications.    </p>    <p>      Credit bureau reports typically include your name, address,      date of birth, social security number, employer's name and      address, as well as your payment history on loans, credit      cards, and other bills.    </p>    <p>      While "the big three" keep the particulars of your      financial situation private, if your credit's good, they'll      sell your name to banks and credit-card      companies-thus all those preapproved, but unsolicited      credit card applications.    </p>    <p>      By the way, Congress is considering a new      "consumer-reporting-reform" bill to curb some of      these marketing practices. Under the proposed law, banks      and credit card companies couldn't go "fishing" for      prospects by sending out so-called preapproved applications      that in fact still need approvals. Credit-card      solicitations would have to be firm offers of credit. You'd      be told how your name was obtained and exactly how you      could "opt-out" of future mailings. Of course, there's a      long road from congressional bill to final law. Until then,      to be removed from the credit bureaus' direct-marketing      files, write to:    </p>    <p>      TRW-Target Marketing Services<br /> Consumer Relations<br /> 901      North International Parkway<br /> Richardson, TX 75081<br />      800-527-3933</p><p> Equifax Options<br /> PO. Box 740123<br /> Atlanta, GA      30374-0123<br /> 404-885-8309</p><p> Trans Union<br /> TransMark, Inc.<br /> 555      West Adams Street<br /> Chicago, IL 60601<br /> 312-466-7815    </p>    <h3>      Warranty Cards: Don't Fill Them Out!    </h3>    <p>      Also known as product-registration cards, these are      packaged with everything from VCRs, televisions, and fax      machines, to toasters, irons, and hair dryers. When you buy      a warranted product, the card usually gets returned not to      the manufacturer, but to a post office box-often in      Denver, Colorado.    </p>    <p>      For example, say you just purchased a combination      telephone-and-thumb exer ciser that was infomercialed on      insomniac TV. It arrives with a warranty card for you to      return to Whatzit Manufacturing at P .O. Box 173035, in      Denver.    </p>    <p>      P.O. Box 173035 isn't rented by Whatzit. It belongs to      National Demographics & Lifestyles (NDL), which manages      a consumer data base of over 30 million names, gathered      from product registrations for about 100 companies. These      cards contain questions about income, marital status, and      hobbies, to name but a few. Once a warranty card is      returned, the information is matched up with facts NDL      collects from other sources, to develop a profile of each      of us, as consumers-which NDL then sells to direct      marketers.    </p>    <p>      You're covered by the manufacturer's warranty-whether      you return the card or not. In fact, many cards include a      statement like the following: "Failure to return the      warranty card will not affect your rights under this      warranty, so long as you retain another proof of purchase,      such as a bill of sale." There's really only one reason to      return a warranty card-to find out about product      recalls. If you return a card for that reason, provide only      your name, address, and the product's serial number. NDL      reports that it now includes a checkoff box, where you can      indicate that you don't want your name sold. But many      warranty cards don't have them. If you decide to return a      card without a check-off box, add a note saying that you      want your name kept private. To be removed from the lists      NDL markets, write to:    </p>    <p>      National Demographics & Lifestyles<br /> Customer Service      Department<br /> 1621 18th Street, #300<br /> Denver, CO 80202<br />      800-525,3533    </p>    <h3>      Another Benefit (Ha) of Credit Cards    </h3>    <p>      As you might expect, credit-card companies use their      customer mailing lists to keep members informed about      benefits and special events-as well as to market      their own goods and services. They also let other companies      send promotional materials to cardholders, either along      with billing statements or through separate    </p>    <p>      mailings. If you're an American Express cardholder who      wants a breather from all these promos, it's relatively      easy. Ask Amex to remove your name from its directmarketing      lists. You can opt out of the Amex in-house lists, the      outside company lists, or both. Contact:    </p>    <p>      Customer Service<br /> American Express<br /> 200 Vesey Street-Tower C<br />      New York, NY 10285<br /> 800327-2177    </p>    <p>      To get your name removed from other credit-card companies'      mailing lists, call or write the customer service office      for each card-the address and phone number should be      listed on your statement. If you have five MasterCards and      eight Visas, all from different banks, you need to contact      all 13, since neither MasterCard nor Visa has a central      customer-service bureau. Note: When you write to a      credit-card company, spend the extra dime, and put your      request in a sealed envelope. Account numbers should never      be publicly displayed.    </p>    <h3>      Beware the Supermarket Scanner    </h3>    <p>      Are you carrying around one of those plastic cards from      your local supermarket that entitles you to loads of extra      savings without clipping coupons? Think the store got you      to apply for this card just to save you some money? Think      again. Once the checkout clerk "swipes" your card, your      name and address are linked to the items you just bought.      It's another way to find out your buying "preferences," so      the supermarket can put you on yet more mailing lists.    </p>    <h3>      Magazines List and List    </h3>    <p>      To make sure that your name isn't sold to a list broker      when you subscribe to a magazine, enclose a note with your      order requesting that your name be put on an "inhouse list      ...only." After receiving the first issue, call the      magazine's subscription department (the phone number will      be listed within the first few pages of the magazine), to      verify that your name has been omitted from any lists that      get sold, rented, or traded. If you're already a      subscriber, look for the magazine's change of address      notice. Often, you'll find instructions there about how to      "opt-out" of the mailing lists the magazine sells.    </p>    <h3>      Post Office Change-of-Address Form    </h3>    <p>      Chances are, the last time you moved, you filled out a      change-of-address form at the post office, known in      bureaucratese as "#3575." Most of us fill them out so we      won't miss Rachel's surprise postcard from Bora      Bora-or some magazine we forgot to alert in time      about the new address.    </p>    <p>      The U.S. P ost Office also takes the liberty of notifying a      few other folks about our comings and goings. Look at the      front of Form #3575, and you'll see this Privacy Act      Statement: "Filing this form is voluntary, but your mail      cannot be forwarded without an order. If filed, your new      address will be provided to individuals and companies who      request it. This will occur only when the requester is      already in possession of your name and old mailing      address..." That's better than the previous statement, in      which the U.S. Post Office just told you that your new      address "may be given to others." Another improvement in      the works is that it's going to be more difficult to get      new addresses for those under court protection, such as      battered women. However, buying and selling will remain a      thriving business for both the Post Office and direct      mailers. Here's how it works:    </p>    <p>      The forwarding information on the almost 40 million      Americans who fill out these forms each year is rented via      the National Change of Address system (NCOA) to some 25      private businesses licensed by the U.S. Postal Service. (At      last report those licensees pay $80,000 up front and      $56,000 a year for the pleasure-and profit-of      being notified that you've changed your address.) Not      surprisingly, included among the licensees are some of the      largest mailing-list brokers, direct-mail merchants, and      credit bureaus in the country-TRW, R.L. Polk, and      Donnelley Marketing, for example. These outfits sell those      40 million annual change of address records to other      companies ...which is how marketers who have your old      address on file know where you've moved.    </p>    <p>      If your name and address are already floating through the      NCOA system via a change of address form, you can ask to be      taken out of the NCOA data base. Send your request,      including your name and both your old and new addresses to:    </p>    <p>      National Customer Support Center<br /> NCOA Department<br /> 6060      Primacy Parkway, Suite 101<br /> Memphis, TN 38188<br /> 800-238-3150    </p>    <p>      A congressional subcommittee investigating the NCOA system      turned up an interesting finding. So it can provide      bulkrate mailers with apartment numbers of city dwellers,      the Post Office has been conducting an experiment in New      York City, trying to create a refined data base by      referring to apartment directories and speaking with      building managers.    </p>    <p>      Although many New Yorkers intentionally leave apartment      numbers off their addresses to protect their privacy and      safety, the Post Office contends that, just like the NCOA      system, no one would be given the apartment number who      didn't already have your address. If the Post Office likes      the results of its experiment in New York, could your city      be next on the list?    </p>    <h3>      Even Uncle Sam Sells Names    </h3>    <p>      If you've ever ordered a publication from the U.S.      Superintendent of Documents, the federal government may      have sold your name and address to private companies. A      spokesperson says the Superintendent of Documents sells      only the names of people or businesses who've ordered      highly specialized periodicals and only after asking their      permission on an order form. If you'd like to be deleted      from mailing lists sold by Uncle Sam, send your name and      address, along with the name of the government periodical      you receive, to:    </p>    <p>      Superintendent of Documents<br /> Attention: Direct Mail Manager<br />      941 North Capitol Street, NE - Mail Stop SM<br /> Washington, DC      20401<br /> 202-512-2258    </p>    <h3>      Motor-Vehicle Bureaus    </h3>    <p>      Many state departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) sell their      data-including make and model of cars owned-to      mailing-list brokers. These brokers, in turn, use the      detailed information they obtain here and elsewhere, to      compile sophisticated lists, for example, of owners of a      particular make of car. A dealer could then send you a      personalized mailing offering a specially priced      winterizing for your 1989 Blue Camaro or the opportunity to      attend a "sneak preview" of the latest in minivans. In some      states, citizens can extricate themselves, either by      indicating a "no-mailing-list" preference on application      forms, or by contacting their department of motor vehicles.      Check with your DMV office; each state's regulations      differ.    </p>    <p>      But by and large, your driving record is fair game to a      potential employer, or anyone else who's willing to pay as      little as $2 (the going rate in Oregon, for example). This      information is a matter of public record, say the DMVs,      which means there's nothing you can do to keep interested      parties from knowing your traffic violations. Another good      reason to drive defensively.    </p>    <p>      If legislation pending in congress passes, information from      your DMV records will only be given to people with a      "specific business-related reason for obtaining the      information." That'll still include direct marketers, but      the DMV will <em>have</em> to give you a chance to say "no      thanks."    </p>    <h3>      Dear "Resident"    </h3>    <p>      Do packets of ads, coupons, or product samples sent to      "occupant" tend to go directly from your mailbox to the      circular file?

For the few unwanted pieces that come to you via      first-class mail, mark them with something like, "Return to      Sender. Don't send me your junk." They'll go back to the      mailers-at their expense-for them to      trash-also at their expense.    </p>    <p>      2. With third-class mail that's accompanied by a      postage-paid envelope, you can stuff the junk into it, and      write your rendition of "Stop sending me junk mail" on the      outside. Pop it in the mailbox, and again, the mailer pays.    </p>    <p>      3. Although it's not the sort of information that the U.S.      Post Office likes to volunteer, you can refuse any piece of      mail. Since direct mailers rarely guarantee return postage,      the Post Office will become responsible for disposing of      most of the junk mail you refuse.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, until the system changes, that won't save us      any money. As taxpayers and stamp buyers, we'll continue to      pay. But maybe, just maybe, if the Post Office has to      handle a few million tons of refused garbage, it'll finally      revise the rate schedules so that those who send,      spend-for the disposal and environmental costs      associated with their sales pitches. Then maybe the direct      mailers will more carefully target their prospects and send      their offerings only to those people who are very likely to      be responsive.    </p>    <h3>      There Are a Few Hopeful Signs    </h3>    <p>      More and more third-class mail is arriving with "opt-out"      check-off boxes. It's getting easier to say "No!" to direct      mar keting campaigns-and to get rid of duplicate      mailings. Recycling is another positive trend. At long      last' there are large-scale efforts underway to reclaim      more of what used to be waste. For example, more of those      promos are being printed on recycled paper. And in the      Northeast, 1,000 communities are participating in the      Marcal Paper Mills' Recycling Project. Marcal picks up      magazines, catalogs, advertising, and bulk business mail,      as well as white office paper, to be recycled into Marcal      tissues, toilet paper, and napkins.    </p>    <p>      Check with your local solid-waste agency to see if the      Marcal program, or something similar, exists in your area.      If not, encourage the powers-that-be to start one. (Marcal      welcomes inquiries about its program from people in the      Northeast. Call the company at 201-796-4000 and ask for the      "Fiber Procurement Department:")    </p>    <p>      And as we've detailed, there's a chance that congress will      pass some useful legislation. It would help if you'd send      postcards to your elected officials to let them know how      much you value privacy and discourage the depredation of      the environment, and that you support legislation to curb      junk mail. You can write to them at:    </p>    <p>      U.S. House of Representatives<br />Washington, DC 20515 or...<br />      U.S. Senate<br /> Washington, DC 20510    </p>    <p>      May you live junk-mail free, happily ever after.    </p>
