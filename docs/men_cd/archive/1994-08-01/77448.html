                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Global Warming as Big Business    </h2>    <p>      A Yale study suggests that a      hotter planet might actually improve food production.    </p>        <h3>      One Per son's Ecological      Disaster...    </h3>    <p>      Earlier scientific predictions that global warming would      devastate U.S. agriculture in the next century by leaving      corn withering on the stalk and desiccating vast wheat      fields across the Midwest are unduly pessimistic, according      to a new analysis by Yale economists. In fact, they suggest      that U.S. agriculture would be minimally damaged and could      even be slightly more profitable if global warming occurs.    </p>    <p>      The new study, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture      and the National Science Foundation is scheduled to be      published later this year in the journal <em>American      Economic Review.</em> It is based on climate and economic      data from 3,000 counties and is the first to use existing      data to project the complex economic changes that would      occur as farmers adapt to rising temperatures by shifting      to more profitable crops or land uses.    </p>    <p>      The study also is the first to base projections on farmland      value, which reflects the most profitable use of the land      under competitive markets, according to Robert Mendelsohn,      professor of forest policy in the Yale School of Forestry      and Environmental Studies. He coauthored the analysis with      Yale economist William D. Nordhaus and Daigree Shaw of the      Institute of Economics in Taipei, China.    </p>    <p>      Previous economic forecasts, which placed U.S. agricultural      losses on average about three times higher than the Yale      study, focused too heavily on declining grain production      and omitted adaptations farmers might make, Professor      Mendelsohn said. For example, a 1989 Environmental      Protection Agency study estimated crop losses by the second      half of the 21 st century at $6 billion to $34 billion per      year, while Yale researchers predict a range of effects on      farmland value from a loss of about $6 billion per year to      a gain of as much as <em>$2</em> billion.    </p>    <p>      "While earlier studies focusing on crop yields provide a      useful baseline, they have an inherent bias that causes      damages to be overestimated," according to professor      Mendelsohn. "The bias is sometimes called `the dumb farmer      scenario' because it ignores possible adjustments such as      the introduction of completely new crops, technological      change or changes in land use from farming to livestock,      grasslands, or forestry."    </p>        <p>      The forecast for American agriculture would be even more      optimistic if the fact that plants grow faster as carbon      dioxide levels increase were taken into account, Professor      Mendelsohn said. In fact, global warming would probably      increase worldwide food production, he added, by extending      the growing season and making farming profitable in areas      now too cold for farming. But the economic impact could be      very harsh in isolated areas, especially in developing      countries dependent on subsistence farming, he said. The      Yale study used a midrange estimate of greenhouse effects,      projecting that a doubling of today's carbon dioxide level      will cause the average global temperature to rise about      five degrees Fahrenheit and increase annual precipitation      by about 8 percent by the second half of the next century.    </p>    <p>      Their research has enabled Professor Mendelsohn and others      to develop a new model for forecasting agricultural      profitability. Called a Ricardian approach, it differs from      previous models by placing less emphasis on wheat and corn,      which require cooler growing conditions but, in 1982,      accounted for only about $22.5 billion-less than 19      percent of the total market. (The Yale researchers used      data from the 1982 Census of Agriculture and based their      forecasts on the dollar value in 1982. )    </p>    <p>      One version of the Ricardian model used by the Yale      researchers focuses on cropland acreage and inherently      places more emphasis on farms growing grains, thus yielding      predictions of slight agricultural losses. The second      version, which yields predictions of agricultural gains as      high as $2 billion a year, emphasizes farm revenues and      places a relatively higher value on irrigated farmland in      the West and South. These regions have a Mediterranean and      subtropical climate-a climate that will become      relatively more abundant with rising global      temperatures-and their crops yield more revenue per      acre than grains. "Irrigated warm-weather crops such as      fruits, vegetables, rice, hay, grapes, and cotton may be a      silver lining behind the climate-change cloud," Professor      Mendelsohn said.    </p>    <h3>      Small Packages    </h3>    <p>      Most of us beat the high cost of living by saving a nickel      here, a penny there. But Bill Kaysing of Soquel,      California, cofounder of the Holy Terra Church in nearby      Aptos, which he started to-help the sick and the homeless,      has found a unique approach to keeping living costs to a      minimum. It's called microhousing and the houses he's      created resemble a child's playhouse or a backyard      toolshed.    </p>    <p>      Back in 1940, after seeing his childhood friend's father      move out of his house and into the backyard tool shed as a      result of a divorce, it hit Kaysing that the toolshed      didn't make a bad home. Even though this was an ordinary      toolshed, it had a toilet, kitchen, and contained      everything to make it a pleasant place to live. He was      overwhelmed by the man's ingenuity and has continued to      apply this innovative thinking to his own life.    </p>    <p>      Kaysing was not alone. The microhouse was officially named      the Granny house back in the 1970s by California State      Senator Henry Mello for its use as a second housing unit      for older people. The relaxed building code's only      requirements were that it be less than 640 square feet and      be occupied by at least one person older than 60. Kaysing,      however, sees the microhouse as suitable for anyone looking      for an alternative or addition to their current home, an      ideal place for teenagers who need a little space from mom      and dad, or homesteaders who just need a quick roof.    </p>    <p>      According to Kaysing, a microhouse can be built with 16      pieces of 4' x 8' plywood. This includes the floor, roof,      and sides.    </p>    <p>      Anyone who is interested in getting hold of blueprints for      a microhouse can write to Bill Kaysing at P O. Box 832,      Soquel, California 95073.    </p>
