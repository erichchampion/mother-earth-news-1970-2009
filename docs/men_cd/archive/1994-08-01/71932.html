                <p>      <strong>Summer Projects</strong>    </p>        <p>      From polywire to radio fences, a      complete guide to buying and maintaining a little harvest      protection    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Gail Damerow    </h5>        <p>      E lectric fences for most pastures are an expensive but      mandatory piece of overhead, and no rancher or farmer with      cattle can do without them. Their styles and methods of      operation are many (see "A Fence That Lasts a Lifetime;"      issue #131), but they are designed to enclose are as on a      grand scale. For those of us with smaller but equally      precious garden plots to protect, modified electric fences      can assure that your hard-won autumn harvest goes      unmolested by other hungry creatures and that your wallet      will survive the effort.    </p>    <p>      With lightweight electric fences, you don't need heavy      posts or specialized tools. All you do is push the      self-insulating plastic or fiberglass posts into the ground      by hand or tap them in with a mallet. And you won't need      posts at all if you put up an "invisible" radio fence to      keep your doggy out of the veggie patch. But more on that      in a moment.    </p>    <p>      Visible electrified garden fencing comes in three options:      twine, tape, and net. A ll three are made from strands of      polyethylene combined with metal filaments, the      polyethylene for strength, the metal filaments to conduct      electric current. Would-be marauders coming into contact      with the fence get a jolt that's not unlike a sharp static      spark.    </p>    <p>      The beauty of electroplastic fencing is that it goes up      fast. You can fence the average family-sized garden in an      hour or less. After the autumn harvest, you can take the      fence down, roll it up, and put it away for the winter,      giving you an unobstructed view of the backyard while your      garden is fallow.    </p>    <p>      Convenience You can finish the average-sized garden with      electroplastic fence in an hour or less.    </p>    <h3>      Polywire    </h3>        <p>      The basic stuff electroplastic fencing is made of is      electroplastic twine, also known as "polywire." Lightweight      and easy to cut with scissors, polywire is used much the      same way you would use any fence wire.    </p>    <p>      It looks a bit different, however, mainly because it comes      in colors-yellow, white, orange, and black. Color      affects both the fence's visibility and its resistance to      ultraviolet sunlight. Black has the greatest resistance to      sunlight but is hardest to see. Color visibility is      strictly for the benefit and safety of humans, since most      animals are color blind.    </p>    <p>      Besides enhancing visibility, the different colors are      handy if you put up a wire-return fence, in which some of      the wires are hot while others are grounded. In a standard      electric fence, all the wires are hot. When a would-be      veggie muncher touches the fence, a jolt passes through its      body, into the ground, through the soil to the fence's      source of energy, and back through the hot wire to complete      the circuit. Dry soil is not very conductive, so an all-hot      system doesn't work particularly well in dry climates.    </p>    <p>      With a wire-return system, a marauder touching two lines in      the fence-one hot and one grounded-gets the      message no matter how dry the soil might be. Making hot      wires one color and grounded wires another lets you easily      spot the occasional short-circuit caused when a sagging or      broken hot wire comes into contact with the soil or a      grounded wire.    </p>    <p>      For a polywire fence, you'll need lightweight posts every      25 feet along the fence line. Fiberglass or plastic posts      are self-insulating. To hold the wire in place, some      require additional spring clips (looking like convoluted      paper clips; other posts have wire spacers molded right on      them. If you use rebar posts (concrete reinforcement bars,      cut to length), you'll need to use the more expensive      screw-on plastic insulators.    </p>    <p>      A reel will keep the polywire from getting tangled or      knotted when you set up your fence and take it down. Reels      come in varying sizes (to accommodate different wire      lengths) and in various styles. Some reels have a ratchet      brake so the spool will stop turning when you stop pulling      the wire. Some have a lock so the wire can't unwind on its      own. A good reel has a carrying handle, adjustable drag so      the wire won't run away from you, and a crank for      rewinding. If you like expensive gadgets, you might get a      reel with a battery-powered energizer hidden in the hub. If      you're on a tight budget, a simple reel designed for      storing extension cords works just fine.    </p>    <p>      You won't need a gate if your fence is designed to keep out      small critters-simply step over. For a taller fence      that bars deer or elk, tie each line wire to an insulated      gate handle and hook the handle into a loop in the      corresponding wire at the other side of the gateway. To get      through the gate, unhook the top few wires and step over      the bottom ones. To push a wheelbarrow or cart through,      unhook all the wires. If you use a wire-return system, take      care when you close the gate not to hook a grounded handle      to a hot loop or you'll short out your fence.    </p>    <p>      A single strand of polywire is often enough to keep out      small varmints. For rabbits and groundhogs, run it 3 to 4      inches off the ground. For small dogs, try 10 or 12 inches      high. If raccoons are getting into your corn, string two      strands, the first 5 inches up, the second 11 inches from      the first (5-11). An all-purpose three wire fence, spaced      4-5-6, should keep out most small dogs, rabbits, raccoons,      groundhogs, and cats. If salad seekers still slip through,      try a 3 4-6-8 configuration.    </p>    <p>      Polywire fencing is so easy to adjust, you shouldn't have      any trouble finding just the right spacing for your terrain      and combination of critters. As a general guideline, for      each species you wish to exclude, string one hot line at      the height of the animal's nose when it's ambling along.    </p>    <p>      Storing away an unused electroplastic fence has a practical      as well as an aesthetic side-a stored fence is      protected from the ravages of sun, wind, and icy weather      and your fence will enjoy a longer useful life if you take      it down seasonally. In doing so taking care not to drag it      along the ground or snag it on rocks. Wrap the fence in      plastic, tape the bundle tight, and hang it where gnawing      rodents can't get at it. A well-treated elecfroplastic      fence can last as long as 10 years.    </p>    <h3>      Hot Tape    </h3>        <p>      Electroplastic tape or hot tape was invented to overcome      the visibility problems of electroplastic twine. Because of      its width, hot tape is more easily seen by fast moving      animals like deer and by klutzy gardeners who tend to bump      into a fence while planting or hoeing.    </p>    <p>      Hot tape is made of the same polyethylene strands and metal      filaments as electroplastic twine, only woven into a flat      strip that looks like ribbon. Tape comes in a variety of      colors and in two widths: 1/2 inch and 1 1/2 inch. The      wider version is easier to see, can be stretched tighter,      lasts longer, has better conductivity and comes in a      dual-track version with a built-in wirereturn system.    </p>    <p>      The visibility of hot tape is enhanced not only by its      width but by its ability to flutter in the slightest      breeze. Fluttering both makes the tape appear wider than it      is and interferes with depth perception, causing marauders      to steer clear. Flutter has its downside, though: wind      abrasion causes tape to wear out more quickly than twine.    </p>    <p>      Polytape is also not quite as easy to splice as polywire.      Two lengths of twine can be joined with tight knots, but      knots in tape have air gaps that cause the fence to lose      conductivity. Steel buckles are available to improve the      conductivity of splices, but you can accomplish the same      thing for less money with strips of aluminum foil. Start a      square knot, lay a strip of foil against it, wrap the foil      around the tape three or four times, finish tying the knot      and squeeze the splice tight.    </p>        <p>      You can add a single strand of hot tape to a twine fence to      make it easier to see, or use hot tape alone. For some      critters, you can get by stringing a single tape at nose      height. For most deer that's 3 feet or a little less, for      elk it's about 4 feet. To discourage honey-loving bears      from raiding beehives kept for garden pollination, try two      strands of tape spaced 8-12. If that doesn't do it, go to      three, spaced 10-10-10.    </p>    <p>      Marauders getting a jolt while investigating a fence out of      curiosity are less likely to come back than animals that      accidentally get zapped. To attract curious deer, smear      heavy foil strips with peanut butter and drape them along      the fence. To attract inquisitive ursines, tie strips of      fresh bacon at intervals along the fence. These treats      entice curious creatures to touch the fence with a moist      nose or tongue, with memorable consequences. A cleared      buffer strip around your garden makes hot tape easier to      see from a distance, giving deer and bear plenty of time to      develop cautious curiosity.    </p>    <h3>      Electroplastic Net    </h3>        <p>      An electroplastic net fence is easier to see and therefore      more reliable than a twine or tape fence. The net is woven      from polywire and comes completely preassembled with posts      and connector clips. One length covers 150 feet and comes      in a neat bundle weighing about 10 pounds.    </p>    <p>      To support the corners, guy lines with tent pegs are      included. But since guys are easy to trip over and hard to      mow around, you'll be better off reinforcing each corner      with an extra post driven 18 inches deep. If your soil is      loose or sandy, add a few extra posts along the sides, as      well, so your fence won't topple when a breeze blows      branches or tumble weeds against it.    </p>    <p>      You won't need a gate here, either. You can step over a      short net fence. If you opt for a taller version, just      switch off the juice and roll back the last panel when you      want to go through.    </p>    <p>      Electroplastic netting comes in a variety of brands and      heights. The shorter the fence, the smaller the mesh and      the more readily it controls small animals. The shortest      net, 20 plus inches, is the standard garden version for      keeping out rabbits, raccoons, groundhogs, and small dogs.      To control deer as well as little critters, run a strand or      two of hot tape above the net.    </p>    <p>      A standard net fence has all hot horizontal except the      bottom one, which lies along the ground and is therefore      grounded. For use in dry climates, a wire return version      has alternating hot and grounded horizontals. A system with      hot wires of one color and grounded wires of another color      is more sensible than a single color system, because you're      less likely to inadvertently join a hot line with a      grounded line and short out your fence.    </p>    <p>      Even though it looks much like a lightweight woven wire      fence, electroplastic netting works only when it's      energized. Otherwise, rabbits may chew through it and pets      or wildlife will get tangled in it, tearing the net and      possibly getting strangled in the process.    </p>    <h3>      Energizers    </h3>        <p>      To energize your fence you'll need an electric-fence      controller, which converts electricity into a series of      high-voltage pulses that course through the fence in short      bursts. This is no place to cut corners by trying to make      your own energizer-homemade fence controllers are,      more often than not, lethal. Besides converting electricity      to a less devastating form, manufactured energizers output      a pulse that gives man or beast an opportunity to pull away      during the <em>off</em> time. To keep electroplastic-fence      material from melting, look for a low impedance unit with      an on time of no more than .003 seconds.    </p>    <p>      Energizers come in various sizes as determined by the      amount of energy they put out. The amount of energy you      need depends on the length of your fence and the number of      line wires it contains. A small unit, putting out around      7,000 volts or up to 0.5 joules, is sufficient for the      average family-sized garden. Each of the suppliers listed      at the end of the article will help you select the best      energizer for your particular situation.    </p>    <p>      Energizers are classified according to their source of      power. The two basic options are plug-in and battery      operated. A plug-in unit makes sense only if your garden is      close to an electrical outlet, say in a potting shed or at      the corner of your house. It is not suitable for a location      where you must run an extension cord from the energizer to      the source of power. The big advantage to a plug-in is that      it more easily overcomes encroaching grass and weeds than a      battery-powered unit. Its chief disadvantage is that it      doesn't work during power outages-a serious      consideration in most rural areas.    </p>            <p>      If your garden doesn't conveniently let you use a plug-in,      a battery-powered controller is your best bet. To keep the      battery from draining quickly, battery-powered units don't      pack the same wallop as plugins and they can't handle much      of a weed load. You therefore have to be more diligent      about keeping down grass and weeds along the fence line.    </p>    <p>      The average garden requires nothing more than a 6-volt      battery controller. When the battery runs down, replace it      with another from any discount store. To keep your battery      running longer, hook it up to a solar collector, or opt for      a controller with a built-in solar panel.    </p>    <p>      Solar energizers in general tend to be at the weaker end of      the battery-power scale. Some solar energizers are much      better than others, primarily because they have larger      panels. The amount of power collected by the panel must      balance the power used by the energizer, which in turn is      determined by the style of fence you choose. No solar      energizer works well in a shady or perpetually cloudy area.    </p>    <p>      No matter what kind of energizer you get, it will need some      degree of protection from weather. Some battery-powered      controllers and all solar charged units have built-in      weather protection, but still must be inspected after hail      or moderate winds.    </p>    <p>      All energizers also need a grounding system. Here again,      some battery-powered units have built-in ground rods; for      others you must purchase a grounding rod and clamp from an      electrical-supply outlet. Do not ground your fence to the      ground wire of a utility pole or to your home's plumbing      system-it's a violation of code. Proper grounding      will not only improve the performance of your fence, but it      will minimize the chance you'll pick up the fence's      "tick-tick-tick" over your phone or radio. During dry      weather, you can improve the ground by watering your ground      rod when you water your garden.    </p>    <h3>      Invisible Fence    </h3>    <p>      An invisible fence shocks a would-be garden intruder with a      sharp snap that's similar to that from an electric fence,      but in this case the intruder must be wearing a shock      collar. Known also as "hidden" or "radio" fence, the system      consists of three basic parts: boundary wire that defines      the area to be fenced, a radio transmitter that sends a      pulsed signal through the wire (generated by either a      12-volt battery or a standard 110-volt wall outlet,      depending on the brand), and a battery-powered shock collar      that picks up the signal.    </p>    <p>      The boundary wire is laid along the ground or buried just      beneath it, leaving your yard unobstructed by cross      fencing. Unless your yard has a sturdy perimeter fence,      stray dogs and wandering wildlife can still get in. The      primary use of this fence is to control your own dog within      your own property.    </p>    <p>      The dog wearing the collar hears a warning signal when it      enters the radio field, which in this case defines the edge      of the garden area. If the dog doesn't retreat within      seconds, it gets a shock. After one or two shocks, the dog      learns to back off as soon as it hears the warning.    </p>    <h3>      Prices    </h3>    <p>      Fence prices vary considerably with the style and brand you      choose. To enclose a 75 x 75 foot garden, expect to pay      just under $150 for an eledroplastic-twine or tape system,      complete with 12 posts and a 6-volt battery-operated      self-grounding controller designated for outdoor use. A      20-inch electroplastic net fence for the same-sized garden,      powered by the same energizer, runs about $275. If you want      to control poochie with a radio fence, pay about $100 or      keep shopping.    </p>    <h3>      Sources:    </h3>    <p>      Fences for Pasture & Garden by Gail Damerow, Rural      Heritage, 281 Dean Ridge Lane, Gainesboro, TN 38562,      615-268-0655-complete guide to fencing.
