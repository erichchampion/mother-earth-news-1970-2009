                <p>      <strong>Natural Kitchen</strong>    </p>		<p>Mother's Kitchen		</p>        <p>      Don't let its      peculiar name desuade you. Fall's purple beauty is      versatile, full of fiber and delicious.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      When I spot a beautiful purple eggplant in the garden,      glistening with dew and ready for picking, I occasionally      recall a memorable eggplant moment. I remember sitting in      an outdoor Greek cafe on the Mediterranean, dining on      Greek-style eggplant and lamb. Or the time my husband and I      munched on grilled eggplant sandwiches as we toured Rome on      foot. Eggplant seemed to taste even more delicious on      foreign soil. But for now I'm standing in the midst of our      Chicago garden next to numerous eggplants that must be      picked and prepared.    </p>    <p>      It's the preparation part that scares some people away from      eggplant (not to mention a somewhat challenging name).      After all, it isn't the type of vegetable that one could      pick and eat raw or pop into the freezer. It's best eaten      freshly prepared, preferably in season but also      occasionally during the winter months. Although eggplant      isn't high in any single nutrient, it contains lots of      fiber that makes it very filling and gives a "meaty"      texture to vegetarian dishes. By itself eggplant is low in      fat and contains few calories. The reason it has such a      greasy reputation is because frying it results in the      porous eggplant soaking up the oil like a sponge.      Lower-in-fat options would be grilling or broiling, baking,      steaming, or simmering in sauces. But eggplant hasn't      always been so edible. Centuries ago it was shunned because      it was believed that consuming eggplant would cause      temporary insanity. When my husband discovered this fun      fact, he decided to attribute my bizarre personality traits      to my frequent eggplant feasts.    </p>    <h3>      Selecting Eggplant    </h3>    <p>      There are numerous summer varieties to choose from. The      dark purple globular is the most common variety sold. The      Japanese eggplant is purple or white with its shape similar      to a small zucchini. The Chinese eggplant is the same shape      but is a light violet color. There is also the round or      oval Italian (Rosa Biancos) eggplant that is white or      purple in color. Rumor has it that the small oval white      eggplant (which resembled eggs) were how the eggplant got      its name.    </p>    <p>      Choose shiny firm eggplants that are free of bruises or tan      patches that indicate decay. If you press the skin with      your thumb, the indentation will spring back if it's fresh.      A good eggplant should feel fairly heavy; a light one may      be tough. Small eggplants have thinner skins, fewer seeds,      and tend to be sweeter and more tender. Larger ones work      well for dishes that require peeled or sliced eggplant. You      can store eggplant at room temperature for a few days or it      can be refrigerated for a week or so.    </p>    <p>      There's been some talk lately of how to determine the sex      of an eggplant by the quantity of seeds. (Do we care?) This      is a fallacy because the eggplant is self-pollinating,      meaning it has both male and female characteristics and can      reproduce on its own.    </p>    <h3>      Preparation    </h3>    <p>      If the eggplant is large, you may want to peel off the      skin, which might be tough. Otherwise peeling is a matter      of personal preference. Many recipes call for salting the      eggplant and letting it sit for about half an hour before      cooking. This step draws out some of the water,      consequently producing a denser texture so it will absorb      less fat. The salt also draws out some of the toxic      solanine that's present in some nightshade vegetables. If      you do salt the eggplant, make sure you rinse it under cold      water and pat dry before cooking. Unlike many vegetables,      eggplant is not really harmed by overcooking, whereas under      cooking results in a chewy, bitter flavor.    </p>    <p>      Broiling or grilling can be used instead of frying when      preparing dishes such as eggplant parmigiana. Charcoal      grilled eggplant can also accompany your barbecue meal. Cut      the eggplant into 1/2-inch slices and brush with olive oil,      garlic, and herbs. Broil about 5 inches from the heat for      about 5 minutes per side.    </p>    <p>      Roasting: Like roasted red peppers, roasted eggplant has a      smoky flavor that tastes great in dips or salads. Cut the      eggplant in half lengthwise and place cut side down on a      foil-lined baking sheet. Broil about 5 minutes until      blistered and blackened. Place in a paper bag for 5 minutes      to loosen the skin for easier peeling.    </p>    <p>      Baking: Cut the eggplant lengthwise and brush with olive      oil. Place the halves cut side up on a cookie sheet. Bake a      standard eggplant for 20-30 minutes at 400°F. The flesh      can be scooped out to puree or to make a stuffing to put      back in the shells. Eggplant can also be cut into cubes and      placed on a foil-lined cookie sheet to bake for about 20      minutes.    </p>    <p>      Steaming: Eggplant can be cubed and cooked in a vegetable      steamer until tender. I prefer this method to microwaving,      which makes it too mushy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Eggplant Sandwiches</strong>    </p>    <p>      Eggplant sandwiches make excellent party appetizers or      picnic food. They can be eaten hot or cold.    </p>    <p>      <em>4 slices plain whole wheat bread</em><br /> <em>1 large      eggplant<br /> 2 large cloves garlic-peeled<br /> 1/2 cup fresh      parsley leaves<br /> 5-6 fresh basil leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried      basil)<br /> a sprig of fresh oregano (or 1/2 -1 teaspoon dried      oregano)<br /> freshly ground pepper<br /> a pinch of cayenne pepper<br /> 2      eggs<br /> 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil<br /> 1/2 pound provolone      (or any strong white cheese)-sliced thin</em>    </p>    <p>      Line a cookie sheet with foil. Lay out the bread so it can      dry out for an hour or so. Slice the eggplant into 1/4 inch      circles, making sure the slices aren't any thicker or the      eggplant won't bake thoroughly. Salt the slices on both      sides and lay them in a colander to drain for at least 30      minutes.    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350°F. In a food processor, mince the      garlic, parsley, peppers, and fresh herbs. Pour into a      shallow bowl. Then pulse the bread into bread crumbs (about      2 cups). Stir into the herb mixture. In the processor,      blend the egg and olive oil. Pour into a separate shallow      bowl.    </p>    <p>      Dry off the eggplant slices. Cut cheese to fit, and place 1      slice between 2 eggplant slices. Dip the sandwich into the      egg mixture, then the bread crumb mixture. You may have to      pat the bread crumbs down on the eggplant so they'll stick.      Place the sandwiches on a greased cookie sheet. Bake for      about 30-40 minutes until t he eggplant is done.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Roasted Ratatouille</strong>    </p>    <p>      Authentic ratatouille (a vegetable stew) has always seemed      too mushy to be appealing to me, so I roast the ratatouille      vegetables and herbs.    </p>    <p>      <em>4 medium Chinese or Japanese (small and thin)      eggplants-cut into 1/2-inch circles<br /> 1/2 teaspoon      salt</em><br /> <em>2 medium summer squash or yellow      zucchini-cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br /> 1 medium sweet red      pepper and<br /> 1 medium sweet yellow pepper-both seeded      and cut into 1/2-inch strips </em><br /> <em>2 small yellow onions      peeled and quartered<br /> 6-8 large cloves garlic-peeled      and finely chopped<br /> 1 teaspoon each: dried oregano, dried      basil, thyme<br /> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br /> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      freshly ground pepper<br /> 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br />      4 Italian plum tomatoes-tops cut off and halved<br />      optional: fresh herbs and balsamic vinegar</em>    </p>    <p>      Thirty minutes prior to cooking: Put the sliced eggplant in      a colander in the sink. Sprinkle the eggplant with salt and      toss with your hands. Let sit at least 30 minutes, then pat      the eggplant dry with a paper towel. Preheat oven to      475°F.    </p>    <p>      Line a cookie sheet, jelly roll pan or similar baking tray      with foil. In a large mixing bowl, toss all the ingredients      (except the tomatoes) together like a salad. Arrange on the      cookie sheet in a single, even layer. Place the tomato      halves on top.    </p>    <p>      Bake for 30-35 minutes until the vegetables are tender but      not mushy. After 20 minutes flip the vegetables over. Serve      hot or at room temperature, topped with chopped fresh      garden herbs or parsley and a splash of balsamic vinegar.    </p>    <h3>      Spicy Eggplant Salad    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 pound eggplant-cut in 1/2 crosswise</em><br /> <em>1      tablespoon sesame or peanut oil<br /> 3 large cloves      garlic-minced<br /> 2 teaspoons fresh ginger      root-peeled and grated<br /> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar      (or rice wine vinegar)<br /> 1 tablespoon dry sherry 2 teaspoons      sugar<br /> 2 green onions-minced<br /> 1 tablespoon sesame      seeds-toasted<br /> 2 green onions-minced<br /> 2      tablespoons cilantro-chopped<br /> chili oil<br /> optional:      mixed lettuce leaves</em>    </p>    <p>      Put a vegetable steamer in a large covered pot with 1 inch      of water. Simmer the eggplant for 20-25 minutes until      slightly shriveled. Let cool at least 10 minutes. In a      small pan sauté the garlic and ginger in the oil for      about 30 seconds. Add the vinegar, sherry, and sugar and      heat until it starts to boil. Set aside. Peel the eggplant      but take care not to pull the pulp off with it. Cut the      skin off the tough ends of the eggplant and start peeling      it lengthwise into long strips about 1/2 inch wide. Put the      eggplant in a bowl, add the green onions and the sesame      seeds. Pour the sauce over it and toss. Top with cilantro      and add chili oil to taste. Serve on top of a handful of      mixed greens.    </p>        <h3>      Chicken Sukiyaki with Eggplant***    </h3>    <p>      <em>3-4 small Japanese eggplants (about</em> <em>2      cups)-cut into thin circles (other eggplants can be      substituted)<br /> 1 teaspoon salt<br /> 1 pound skinless, boned      chicken breast, partially frozen-sliced into thin      strips<br /> 1 teaspoon peanut or sesame oil<br /> 2 large cloves      garlic-minced<br /> 6 green onions green tops cut off and      cut diagonally into 1 1/2 inch pieces<br /> 1/4 - 1/3 cup      unsalted chicken broth<br /> 1 1/2 cups mushrooms-sliced      thin<br /> 1/3 cup apple cider<br /> 1 8-ounce can bamboo      shoots-rinsed and drained<br /> 1/4 cup tamari soy      sauce-whisked together with 1 tablespoon sugar<br /> 2 cups      fresh spinach leaves (packed)-cut into 1/2 inch      strips<br /> thin noodles or brown rice</em>    </p>    <p>      In a medium saucepan, boil about 3 cups water with the      salt. Turn off the heat and drop the sliced eggplant into      the water. Let sit 5 minutes and then drain well in a      colander. On medium-high heat, heat up the oil in a wok or      large skillet. (I use a nonstick pan.) Sauté the      chicken pieces until browned. Stir in the garlic and onions      until slightly browned. Remove chicken from pan, pour into      a bowl, and set aside. Sauté the eggplant on      medium-high heat 2-3 minutes until tender but not mushy,      stirring occasionally. If the eggplant begins to stick, add      some chicken broth, a little at a time. Add the mushrooms      and sauté for about 2 minutes until they begin to      wilt. Stir in the bamboo shoots and the rest of the      ingredients except the spinach. Reduce heat to medium and      simmer a few minutes while preparing the noodles. Stir in      the spinach and simmer for about a minute just before      serving.    </p>    <p>      Not Always a Favorite<br /> Centuries ago, eggplant was shunned      because it was believed to cause insanity.    </p>
