                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY VET</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Andrea Looney, DVM, provides a simple solution to      soothe your dog's fear of thunder.<br /></strong>    </p>        <p>      By this time, I hope you are all enjoying a wonderful fall.      We have been getting some intriguing questions sent to us      and I am hoping to receive many more prior to the holiday      mail rush. It seems reasonable to focus one of the upcoming      issues on behavior problems alone as I have received so      many questions dealing with animal behavior and related      problems. It's fulfilling to me as veterinarian to realize      that so many individuals are attempting to find solutions      to their animals’s health and behavior problems.      I’ll start this issue with a question concerning      thunder phobia in dogs, a common behavior problem this time      of the year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:<br />      Our German shepherd, Matilda, has always had a fear of      thunderstorms. She becomes so agitated that we've      considered using tranquilizers just to keep her from laying      waste to the house. Do you have any suggestions that are a      bit less drastic?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jean Simonez<br />      Eugene, OR</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Jean:<br />      Many dogs experience fear of thunder, firecrackers,      gunshots, and other loud noises. It is not uncommon for      these animals to have such stress and anxiety that they      endanger the welfare of others and cause property damage      while reacting. One way to deal with the phobia of thunder      is to tape record a storm occurring. Test to see if the dog      will react to this as he does to the real thing. If he      does, let some time elapse (one or two weeks) before      attempting the following:    </p>    <p>      Teach the dog to lie down and stay on a favorite rug. Play      the recording at very low (inaudible) volume. After five      minutes, increase the volume so the thunder is barely      audible. If the dog remains calm, give him a food reward.      If the dog becomes uncomfortable, try to soothe him.    </p>    <p>      If the animal becomes very upset, turn the recording down      until he relaxes. Proceed with increases in the tape volume      very slowly until the dog learns to tolerate the noise,      offering a food reward each time the animal remains calm.      The whole session should mimic a thunderstorm, so try to      limit the listening to under a half hour. Over a period of      weeks, repeat the maneuver in different locations, some      dark, others with bright lights being turned on and off. In      addition, play the tape softly during exercise and at      meals, rewarding the animal if no outbursts occur. Drugs      may help decrease the anxiety of this desensitizing process      but should be used only on maniacal animals.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:<br />      Our golden retriever, Miguel, gets multiple yeast      infections in his ears. We are constantly trying to clean      them but the problems recur. Why?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Joseph K. Banks<br />      Springdale, UT</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Joseph:<br />      Many retrievers are predisposed to ear problems. Some dogs      via hereditary backgrounds have horrific ear      anatomy-very distorted canals, poor membranes, hair      in the canal-which creates a perfect moist, dark      breeding ground for bacteria and yeast. Other dogs have      such severe allergies that their ears and feet become the      target itch spots. Most of these animals need not even come      in contact with grasses, pollens, or molds; they simply      inhale these substances and their ears and feet become red,      hot, itchy, and swollen. Yeast infections commonly occur in      either of these cases because the allergies or the      distorted anatomy cause the pH and the moisture of the ear      canal to change. Yeast are simply secondary invaders and      are taking advantage of a high-pH, moist spot to grow and      cause problems.    </p>    <p>      Most dogs's ears are better left alone if the animal does      not seem to be in any pain or discomfort. Even the simplest      treatment or cleaning (with mineral oil, baby oil, or      alcohol) can harm the canal, cause inflammation, and carry      an infection deeper into the inner ear.    </p>    <p>      A general cleanser safe for the inside of the ear flap and      the outer part of the canal is a 50/50 mixture of vinegar      and water. I never recommend pouring anything into the      canal in case the eardrum is torn, but it is OK to apply      this to a cotton ball and clean the ear carefully. The      vinegar provides a pH that is conducive to good bacteria      and very few yeast-things that normally live in a      healthy ear. This simple formulation is useful for most      labs and retrievers, and helps prevent yeast infections or      "overgrowths" which commonly occur in the spring and fall.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:<br />      I've heard dozens of rumors on how to best deworm a horse.      What do you think is an appropriate schedule?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Heather James<br />      Alpena, MI</em>    </p>        <p>      Dear Heather:<br />      There are a slew of common misconceptions about deworming      plans for farm animals. Since parasites are a top cause of      unthriftiness, weight loss, poor exercise performance, and      colic, it's worthwhile to entertain a few of these "myths"      and understand what current "realities" are behind them.    </p>    <p>      For instance, repeated deworming was thought to be the most      effective method of worm control. In actuality, seasonal      deworming (performing in the spring and summer) is just as      effective as year-round treatments. And believe it or not,      twice weekly removal of manure is even more effective than      seasonal deworming. It was once thought that rapid rotation      or changing of deworming drugs every few months prevents      the worms from becoming resistant. However, this common      practice of rotating dewormers at every treatment or      several times a year has been associated with the rapid      spread of drug-resistant worms in horses. You are far      better off annually changing the medications you use and      using only one, not a combination of dewormers, each year.      The more frequently the same medication is used, the faster      drug resistance will develop.    </p>    <p>      What's better, paste or tube dewormers? Tube dewormers are      those liquid emulsions generally administered by your      veterinarian via a nasogastric tube. Paste dewormers come      in an oversized syringe and can be given directly in the      mouth versus down the nose (like the tube dewormers). Paste      dewormers have been found to be as effective, and safer and      easier than tube dewormers.    </p>    <p>      A common myth is that the large strongyles are the most      important worms to go after in horses. In reality, there      has been a dramatic drop in their prevalence since the      advent of modern dewormers in the 1960s. While they are      still around, using deworming medications which only treat      these parasites probably overlooks other more common pests      in your horse's gastrointestinal tract.    </p>    <p>      People also may have heard that winter and frost commonly      kill the parasites living in the pasture. Subzero      temperatures and heavy snowfalls have very little adverse      effect on encysted infective larvae in the pasture. These      resistant forms of worms generally survive even over winter      months. Harrowing is beneficial-especially when the      weather is hot and dry as it exposes the eggs and larvae in      the pasture to sunlight and drying (the best deworming      agents!). Plowing during very damp conditions simply      spreads viable larvae and makes living conditions more      beneficial for them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:<br />      Our horse is a "headshaker." We have been unable to see any      flies, mites, or ticks in and around his ears. What else      causes this nasty vice?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ross Duncan<br />      Hondo, NM</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Ross:    </p>    <p>      "Headshaking" refers to an abnormal condition when a horse      shakes its head in the absence of any obvious cause, and      with such frequency and violence that it becomes dangerous      and distressed. It is one of the most poorly understood      conditions plaguing horses and a cause of great frustration      to owners and veterinarians alike. It is a disease which      appears to be seasonal, being worse in the spring and fall,      yet disappearing in winter. Signs are observed mostly at      exercise but can become progressively worse.    </p>    <p>      A list of the potential causes of head-shaking includes      allergies, sinus disease, nerve sensation, inner ear or      guttural pouch disease, cysts of the eyes and ears, moon      blindness, dental pain, or skeletal/muscle pain in the      neck. Allergies are one of the most likely causes of      headshaking, with tree pollens in early spring, grass      pollens in the early summer, and molds in the fall being      likely culprits.    </p>    <p>      Intolerance of the bit or problems with tack are also      frequently blamed as causes of headshaking. Lunge the      horse, with and without a bit in its mouth or tack on, and      see if it makes a difference. If the problem persists once      equipment problems have been eliminated, your veterinarian      may opt to perform some endoscopy (internal visual      examination using specialized halogen lighting) or X-rays      to check for other medical causes. A nerve block may be      used diagnostically or as treatment for the condition at      times.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Now it is possible to painlessly inject a microchip      into your pet.…..which vets and police can scan with      special equipment (left) to immediately trace your lost or      stolen animal.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Medical therapy of suspected allergic conditions has been      largely unrewarding, but your veterinarian may be able to      suggest appropriate antihistamines or bronchodilators which      may help. Another alternative is to completely alter the      animal's environment where he lives and exercises; chances      are that you'll leave the allergic substance behind. If you      highly suspect allergies are the problem, you may alleviate      the signs, albeit temporary, by hanging a piece of muslin      or fine mesh from the bridle or halter, letting it fall      over the nostrils, to filter out the pollens and keep      insects out of the nose.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:<br />      Our sow has been lame on her front leg for over two months.      Would antibiotics help?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jane Hilzer<br />      Wausau, WI</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Jane:    </p>    <p>      My experience with lame pigs is that most cases are not      related to infections and few respond to antibiotics. The      focus then should be on determining if it's worth treating      the individual pig and correcting the management factors      which may be responsible for the lameness. If the sow is an      older, open animal or one that has had poor reproductive      history regardless of age, culling may be more appropriate      than treatment. Treating a chronic lameness can lead to      weight loss and decreased reproductive performance.    </p>    <p>      Examine the environment of this sow. Some pigs do poorly on      new concrete. Others do poorly on floors that are      constantly moist. Are the slats in the floors poorly      maintained? Are there any rough, protruding objects in the      fencing that could cause injury or constant straining of      ligaments and tendons?    </p>    <p>      Try moving the female from a gestation crate to a pen. The      ability to exercise or increase activity often helps a      great deal. Create a cleaner environment with fresh air for      her to be housed in temporarily. Try to reduce the stress      in her life as much as possible. You can use steroids and      aspirin-like medications to decrease inflammation, reduce      pain, and increase appetite, but they often "mask" pain and      may induce gastric ulcers. If antibiotics are necessary,      contact your veterinarian for an appropriate treatment with      a short withdrawal time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:<br />      Our cats spend days and nights outdoors. Each time I get      them identification collars, they quickly remove them, even      the elastic ones. Are there other options?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Allison Anne Arnold<br />      Berwyn Heights, MD</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Allison:    </p>    <p>      Animal identification has always been a concern for      veterinarians and pet owners. Countless lost-pet signs and      ads in the newspaper attest to this fact. Many new      solutions to easy pet identification now exist.      Identification tags and tattooing are well known solutions.      Many folks do not like using ID tags as they are accustomed      to using a collar, which though effective, might strangle      or entangle an animal. I have not seen this happen,      although I'm sure it's a possibility. However, cats seem      very adept at wiggling out of these and harnesses as well.      If the cat is an outdoor animal, the owners must check the      skin and hair of collared animals regularly for abrasion of      the skin or loss of hair. Most animals receive an ID tag      upon getting vaccinated for rabies. A number on this tag is      recorded at the office of the veterinarian and serves to      locally identify the pet. Tattooing is an effective      permanent method of pet identification but requires special      equipment and general anesthesia. The American Pet      Association has one of the most comprehensive national      tattoo registries.    </p>    <p>      Microchip identification is rapidly becoming one of the      most nationally recognized methods of pet identification.      Microelectronic technology has enabled veterinarians to      inject tiny biocompatible pieces of glass under the skin of      pets and zoo animals. These microchips are about the size      of a grain of rice and each broadcasts a radio wave      containing information about the pet's owner, address,      phone number, and pertinent medical needs. A hand-held      reader, owned by many humane societies, SPCAs, and      veterinarians, "scans" the microchip and transmits the info      to a computer screen to identify the lost pet. The      microchips are safe, inexpensive, and are a promising      deterrent to pet theft and loss nationally. The hitch, of      course, is that they will be of significantly less help if      a neighbor five miles down the road happens to find your      lost pet instead of a vet or the police. In those      instances, the tried and true technique of keeping a secure      collar on your dog or cat is still hard to beat.    </p>
