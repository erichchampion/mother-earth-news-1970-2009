                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Deep-pile those weeds away.<br /></strong>    </p>        <h3>      Gotcha Covered    </h3>    <p>      An earthly answer to a gardener's heaven is just under your      nose...er, your feet. Any way you roll them out, rugs do an      outstanding job. They kill weeds, let in the water, are      readily available, and extremely cheap.    </p>    <p>      For a typical row garden, discarded carpeting can be      stripped into 30-inch widths and rolled out to create an      edge and pathway between crops. Use a sharpened fishing      knife, tin snips, or an Exacto knife to slice 30-inch      strips of old jute-backed carpeting. To add longevity to      the carpeting, first cover the soil beneath the carpet with      black and white, soy-based newspapers and let 'er roll.    </p>    <p>      For the typical row garden, lay the row string, sow the      seeds, dress with your favorite fertilizer, water, and do      the next row in the same fashion. While the color and look      may draw comment, the result is a saving of hoeing time,      water, and back pain.    </p>    <p>      Similarly, when setting out hills of squash, cukes, or      melons, I use a large single square rug and cut holes in      the surface with a pattern to accommodate the plants or      seeds. This provides both spacing for the vines and the      mulch for the soil surface. I handle my tomato cages by      laying a 30-inch strip, placing the cages and plants in a      row, then use a healthy amount of newsprint to cover the      three-foot space between the cages before laying the next      row of carpeting.    </p>    <p>      Keeping one jump ahead of the trash pick-up is the easiest      way to obtain your reusable strip mulching carpet. Striking      a deal with a local carpet layer and requesting remnants of      old carpets salvaged from recent installments is also an      easy source.    </p>    <p>      The strips can be saved from season to season by rolling      them up and storing them in piles near the garden. Mine      have lasted for four years. The pieces that succumb to      nature and defy pick-up, I rake together and deposit at the      base of fruit and ornamental trees for a permanent mulch.      But beware-don't allow this mulching to become too      thick or it will invite rodents to nest and use your tree      for fast food.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Carol S. Larson<br />      Harvard, IL</em>    </p>        <h3>      Kerosene Defeats Mosquitoes    </h3>    <p>      When the Frenchmen started to build the Panama Canal, they      were defeated by a tiny but formidable opponent: the      Anopheles mosquito, which had (and continues to have) a      habit of carrying malaria. It turned out that the French      actually brought the trouble to their doorstep. Aesthetics      demanded that they have a moat around their cottage, which      was unfortunately a perfect breeding place for this      mosquito.    </p>    <p>      The United States moved in and soon scientists were      dispatched to study the Anopheles mosquito. Since In 1902,      the only light available for night work was from kerosene      lamps, there was quite a bit of that fuel around. And when      a drop of it accidentally fell into a jar of larvae, they      died in a matter of five minutes. Flash! How to treat these      mosquitoes was discovered.    </p>    <p>      When the U.S. Corp of Engineers sprayed the swamps with      kerosene, control was well under way and fairly complete.    </p>    <p>      During World War II, I was a malaria control officer in      Panama. We treated ponds in the early 1940s the same way I      treat mosquitoes today, with kerosene.    </p>    <p>      A group of fertilized mosquito eggs, or a raft, looks like      a burnt melon seed and hatches out in three days. The      hatched larvae are organic feeders for seven days and then      pupate into pupae, which do not feed. Three days later, the      adult emerges from the pupae.    </p>    <p>      We have 24 rain barrels for watering our garden. To be on      the safe side, I interrupt this life cycle in our barrels      with two teaspoons of kerosene per barrel, or one teaspoon      per five gallon bucket and stir it up to make a very thin      film of oil on the surface. I treat these containers every      seven days and kill millions of mosquitoes in the process.    </p>    <p>      Remember, the larvae are organic feeders. In cleari water,      they will eat each other. Only a few adults will emerge      from the 100 eggs per raft. The mosquito knows this and      chooses dirty water to lay its eggs. The eggs are bright      yellow when first laid, but turn black with the morning      daylight. In dirty water, 100 eggs will emerge from a raft      of eggs.    </p>    <p>      Invite the mosquito to come to your trap by setting out a      container of dirty water and treat it according to these      instructions. A note of warning: If you fail to treat your      trap consistently, you will be raising mosquitoes. Use      dirt, garbage, etc., to make an enticing trap. You will      probably enjoy studying these insects and might encourage      your children to do the same. The kerosene evaporates      overnight and mosquitoes can use your trap the next      evening.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Niki Rini<br />      Hartville, OH</em>    </p>        <p>      <br />    </p>    <h3>      Saving Dough    </h3>    <p>      I love to make use of all the fresh blackberries, peaches,      blueberries, and apples that nature lavishes upon us during      the fall. So I treat my family and friends to lots of      crusty cobblers and pies. But I am also one of those people      who can't bring herself to waste anything-even the      tiniest piece of crust. If you, like me, find yourself with      small pieces of pie crust dough that you hate to throw      away, here's a rewarding solution: Place small balls of the      leftover dough into miniature muffin pans and press them to      fit the bottom and sides of the muffin cups. Pop the muffin      pan into the oven along with your fruit cobbler and bake      until lightly brown (about 10 minutes). Allow the small      shells to cool and place in a freezer container that you      can continue to add to each time you have leftover dough.      By the time the holidays roll around, you will have dozens      of these shells to thaw and fill with chicken salad, egg      salad, veggie dips, jams, and anything else that might suit      your fancy. These make an easy, festive, tasty addition to      any party or special occasion. And, by the way, if you      don't own a miniature muffin pan, this tip will make it      worth your money to purchase one.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Cathy Bowers<br />      Lancaster, SC</em>    </p>    <h3>      Make Your Own Breakfast Cereal    </h3>    <p>      It seems that a lot of people are tired of high cereal      costs and would like something natural for breakfast. I      bought the items for my cereal at the local co-op and it      saved me about $2.50. Hope you enjoy the recipe.    </p>    <p>      <em>½ cup rolled oats<br />      ½ cup oat bran<br />      ½ cup wheat bran<br />      ½ cup wheat germ<br />      ½ cup unsulfured molasses</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix ingredients well. Don't add water or bake.<br />      <em>Note:</em> The amounts in the recipe can be adjusted to      your convenience and other items such as rye flakes can be      added for variation.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Howard Luloff<br />      St. Louis Park MN</em>    </p>
