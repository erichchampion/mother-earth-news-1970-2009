                    <p><strong>      Waiting for Gingrich.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>An environmentalist is faced with two primary      objectives.</strong>    </p>    <p>      1. To husband the Earth, offering leadership, know-how, and      wisdom (when you find it) in stewardship of the land and      waters-including strong support for the laws and      government agencies created to correct the environmental      mistakes that mankind has made in a mere thousand years or      two.    </p>    <p>      2. To encourage self-reliance and sturdy independence on      the land-in pursuit of a life of natural virtue,      using little and wasting nothing that can't be replaced.      "Walk Softly on the Earth, Leaving Only Footprints."    </p>    <p>      These pursuits are normally perfectly compatible. But when      they do come into conflict-say, if a homesteader's      privy leaches into a mountain stream-MOTHER has      invariably held that Earth comes first and individual      interests come second (especially if other readers live      downstream).    </p>    <p>      <strong>AIR REGULATIONS APPROPRIATE FOR COLORADO SIMPLY      SHOULD NOT APPLY EVERYWHERE ELSE.</strong>    </p>    <p>      She'd demand that the privy be moved and its drainage field      ditched deep and diverted to a drywell-and quick.      Time was, she'd go along with a government agency or a      private lawsuit demanding a clean-up as well-even if      the reader's independence was threatened. We celebrated      when DDT was banned and the Great Lakes cleanup started.      And we cheered even louder when the peregrine falcon (its      reproductive ability once severely threatened by DDT) came      off the Endangered Species list and the banks of      Cleveland's Cuyahoga River (that once caught fire from      accumulated pollution) became a bathing beach once again.    </p>    <p>      But, as early as the late '80s, it was becoming      increasingly apparent that some government environmental      agencies were overstepping legitimate authority, and some      of the Green non-profits and "public interest" groups were      less interested in benefiting the environment than forcing      an obsolete socialistic political agenda.    </p>    <p>      Reluctantly, we came to believe that simple lifestyle      options-in housing, transportation, home food and      energy production, home schooling, and even our Second      Amendment rights to protect life and property-that      made the good country life possible were slowly being      curtailed by ever more specious, petty, or      counterproductive regulations imposed by agencies she once      encouraged...especially "one-size-fits-all" policies of the      Environmental Protection Agency, and in particular its      uniform nationwide standard for wood-burning stove      emissions.    </p>    <p>      Nobody can argue with restrictions on wood fires (or any      other gas or particulate generators) in the Los Angeles      basin or Vail, Colorado, ski bowl, where atmospheric      inversions trap auto exhaust and God knows what other      effusions from too many post-Industrial Age humans crowding      an ecosystem able to support a normal population of bears      and blue jays and perhaps a few stone-age Native Americans.    </p>    <p>      But, with the wood heat fad that followed the OPEC oil      crises of the '70s, these fragile environments were      overloaded with the smoke from too many hobby woodstoves      that were ineptly operated by folks more interested in      being politically correct than staying warm. Wood smoke      turned the normal smog a greasy creosote-brown that dyed      hanging laundry and even ate holes in the siding of      mountainside homes. Lord knows what it could do to the      lungs of an ordinary mortal.    </p>		    <p>      But, it bespeaks the death of common sense when the EPA      ham-handedly imposed L.A./Vail-style restrictions on the      rural 90 percent of North America where atmospheric      inversions are unknown and where most wood smoke drifts      away to biodegrade sweetly, just as it has done since the      first lightning bolt started the first fire in a forest of      tree ferns during the carboniferous period 345 million      years ago. And, which it continues to do today- when      natural fires in the West burn hundreds of thousand of      acres of forest (thousands more trees than are cut for cord      wood) each year...with no long-term effect on air quality.      Many if not most of MOTHER'S readers who elect country      living also choose to step off the money-chase and live      poor by conventional standards. But those EPA restrictions      offer them precious few choices in new-built woodstoves,      choices that are too often tiny "hi-tecs" that can't heat a      big room, clunky catalytics or mechanized pellet stoves      costing $1,000 and up, or site-built firestoves costing      $5,000!    </p>    <p>      Want to know EPA's solution for the poor? "[F]or those who      cannot afford the initial costs of a new certified wood      heater, this regulation does not restrict the sale of      secondhand stoves. The secondhand stove market is a major      source of inexpensive wood heating appliances." <em>(EPA,      40 CFR Part 60: Standards of Performance for New Stationary      Sources; New Residential Wood Heaters; Final Rule. Federal      Register, Part II, v.53, No.38, Friday, February 26, 1988      pgh. 3, col. 1., p. 5864.)</em>    </p>    <p>      "Let 'em buy used." It reminds me of Marie Antoinette's      response when told the Parisian poor couldn't buy bread:      "Let them eat cake." Marie lost her head over that      one...but the EPA unfortunately didn't. Instead they had      the arrogance to prohibit country folks from making their      own stoves out of old oil drums or whatever. Why? Because      of "...sales that will be lost by manufacturers of wood      heaters who have incurred the additional expense of      [building "government" stoves]." The whole emissions      program could therefore only be enjoyed by those      manufacturers who could re-tool their entire stove line.      The end result is that Government forced a particular      market upon everyone. Probably not what the founding      fathers intended.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Dilemma</strong>    </p>    <p>      On learning this, MOTHER shifted on the wood-smoke      debate-recalling her support from government and      passing it totally to her readers. Not that she's less in      favor of continued environmental protection. It's just that      the environmental laws that you and I helped effect through      our elected representatives are being implemented by a      bunch of bureaucrats determined to run our country lives      from the climate-controlled comfort of their offices in      downtown, center-city Washington, D.C.-in pristine      ignorance of the problems we face.    </p>    <p>      Incensed as we are at bureaucratic excesses, we fear most      of all that excessive zeal of the "environmentalist police"      that will turn public opinion against environmental      protection itself-not just the few apparatchik who      are proving the old adage, "power corrupts."    </p>    <p>      And, that's not her only conflict... she is also convinced      that EPA is a major cause of the steady decline the wood      heat industry has experienced since the '80s-years in      which the market has suffered from increasingly sluggish      sales A major initial cause, of course, was the fall in oil      prices that followed the dissolution of the OPEC cartel.      But, the enduring decline in stove sales is at least as      attributable to the loss of vitality by an industry that is      being smothered in its own restricted emissions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WONDERFUL VARIETY OF "AIRTIGHT" STOVES WE HAD      TO CHOOSE FROM IN THE '70S HAS VANISHED, POSSIBLY      FOREVER.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>No Joy</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wood heat quite simply isn't fun any more. If you were      around in the '70s- heyday of modern wood      heat-you'll remember the wonderful variety of      "airtight" stoves we had to choose from:<br />      potbellies, parlor heaters, laundry stoves, 6-Platers,      Princess Kitchen Ranges, Franklin Fireplaces, and other      domestic and Taiwanese reproductions of 18th and 19th      century iron stoves. Plus elegant Morsos and Petit Godins      and Jotuls and other European imports in vibrant Dansk      enamel colors, and Fisher's family of Bears, Vermont      Casting's Defiant and Vigilant, and the Woodsmen and      Arctics, Downdrafters and Baseburners, and a thousand other      models made by 400 firms in Canada and the U.S. of welded      steel, soapstone, Russian tin, and cast iron.    </p>    <p>      Sure, they smoked if operated in air-starved mode. And too      many were installed ineptly and dangerously. And too many      flues and stovepipes went uncleaned for so long they leaked      and dripped creosote all over the floor, and posed real      fire hazards. But we've learned to handle wood fires in 25      years, and it would be good to offer new woodburners some      reason to accept the challenge of staying warm through the      hard labor of their own hands. Now, the EPA offers them      only two choices in a new-built, efficient log burner: a      generally undersized, expensive "hi-tec" or an oversized      and equally expensive catalytic stove. External      ornamentation aside, "government stoves" are all the same:      too often lacking fire and joy.    </p>    <p>      No wonder the industry is faltering. You can count the      successful stove makers on the fingers of one hand (check      the ads in MOTHER or any other magazine). And those that      are staying afloat do so only by selling more and more      fossil-fuel alternative stoves such as the gas-log models.      And who can blame them? They can only sell what the EPA      certifies. And in so choking the market with regulations,      the EPA is<br />      choking wood heat in America.    </p>    <p>      We might be tempted to welcome this development. It means      that wood heat has come back home to the country where it      belongs-even if we do have to chisel a new set of      fire bricks to reline the old Klondike so she'll keep on      pumping out heat for another generation. Cordwood will be      less in demand, thus cheaper-and a supply of      well-dried hardwood will be a whole lot easier to find if      the home-cut runs short in February.    </p>    <p>      But, it hoists us onto another dilemma. What may be good      for the country-living, wood-heating readers is not good      for a planet where more wars have been waged over energy      resources than anything else but the name of God. Hydro and      wind and solar power are promising and nuclear fusion may      become a reality...someday. But here and now-today in      North America- wood is plentiful and is our only      really practical self-renewing heating fuel. Its      responsible use should be encouraged.    </p>    <p>      But, durned if it isn't government and their wood-stove      emissions-controls that are killing the very industry they      were supposed to give a new breath of life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRITICS OF THE EPA’S OVERREGULATION CHEERED      WHEN GINGRICH'S BAND OF BEFORMERS MARCHED IN, BUT WE WILL      STAND TO LOSE BOTH CLEAN AIR AND WATER ACTS IN THE      PROCESS.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Newt to the Rescue?</strong>    </p>    <p>      How's that old Chinese curse go..."May you live to see all      your dreams fulfilled"? Well, we wanted some deregulation      and apparently we've gotten it. Newt Gingrich and the new      gang in Congress were elected by voters fed up with an      overgrown government misusing war powers in an era when the      big wars have all been won-and especially furious at      the excesses of EPA and friends. A promising development.      But soon they began comparing EPA tactics to Nazi      Brownshirts, vowing to gut the agency-and      worse-to pull so many teeth from the Clean Air, Clean      Water, and Endangered Species Acts that we'd undo in the      stroke of a pen what it took 20 years to accomplish. The      baby was all set to be tossed out with the bathwater, and      we watched each Washington reform summit with hand-wringing      anticipation.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, the new crowd's first attempts at drastic      environmental reform have been rejected-and rejected      with an alacrity and firmness that is truly encouraging. On      July 29, 1995, in a repudiation of powerful timber      interests, the Supreme Court reversed an earlier Federal      Appeals Court ruling and effectively broadened the      Endangered Species Act of 1973 to protect not just Mother's      critters but their habitat as well-a clear and      long-needed victory for environmental common sense (the      Apache trout just came off the endangered list-but it      wont stay off long without pristine mountain streams to      live in.). And on July 28, the House narrowly defeated an      attempt by its Young Turks to employ the      "politics-as-usual" methods they got elected to curtail and      heap 17 special-interest-lobbied EPA-limiting provisions on      the back of an appropriations bill...without debate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Whew!</strong>    </p>    <p>      But, they aren't done and EPA will certainly be relieved of      many powers it has abused. That's as it should be-if      the measures are well thought-out and thoroughly aired in      public debate. But, encouraged as she is that the energetic      new powers in Washington (suitably constrained by the Court      and by clearer heads among their own legislative peers)      will bring common sense to environmental regulation, she is      still hung out on the horns of a dilemma. If the EPA stove      regulations are tossed out, life and fun will return to the      industry, we'll have a broader choice of wood heaters      again, and use of renewable wood will begin to increase.      But, if we take authority for regulating stove emissions      back from Big Brother, we are obligated as well to accept      responsibility for keeping our own air clean and safe. And,      what will the state legislatures do under pressure from      timber or industrial interests that carry much more clout      on a local level? Worse, what will Congress do when our      backs are turned?    </p>    <p>      For now, we'll have to just live with the dilemma, keep our      eyes wide open and our letter-writing pencil sharpened.      Because, as we are too inclined to forget, your legislators      will only do what you allow them to.    </p>
