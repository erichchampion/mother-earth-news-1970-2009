                <p>      <strong><strong>COUNTRY VET</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>Crossing state lines, health papers, and      other travel tips.</strong></strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Carol Erikson, DVM.</h5>    <p>      Photos William A. Cotton    </p>		    <p>      I bought a horse in Kentucky and I need to haul him home to      New Mexico in a few months. I was told I need a vet to      issue health papers on him so I can cross state lines. What      does this involve? Will I need to get vaccinations? What is      the reason for this inspection?    </p>    <p>      -Paul Matthews<br />      Corona, NM    </p>    <p>      Health papers for livestock were developed to control the      spread of contagious disease as well as to protect the      owner/mover from unforeseen health problems during      transport. Regulations governing vaccination and testing      vary from state to state. Your vet will be able to tell you      what is required before entering a specific area.    </p>    <p>      Your horse should always be current on vaccinations anyway.      A four-way tetanus, influenza, and sleeping sickness      vaccination should be given annually regardless of      transportation status. Other vaccinations depend on age,      breeding status, and use of your animal. These would be:      streptococcus equi, rhinopneumonitis and Potomac horse      fever. Vaccination not only protects your horse when      entering a new area, but also other horses that s/he may      contact.    </p>    <p>      A blood test for equine infectious anemia, commonly called      the Coggins Test, may also be required when crossing state      lines. Your vet must fill out the proper forms, draw blood      for serum, submit this to a lab, and get results before      your horse can be moved. It pays to start early when      considering shipping livestock.    </p>    <p>      In Western states, your move would require obtaining a      brand inspection regardless of whether your horse is      branded or not. A brand inspection confirms that the horse      in question is being moved legally, and not being stolen.      This would be similar to carrying vehicle registration      papers in case you're pulled over by the highway patrol. It      may also be wise to carry your horse's registration papers      and the bill of sale should proof of ownership be      necessary.    </p>    <p>      Certain tests and inspection papers have time constraints      as well. You need to be well-prepared for all regulations      that your horse may encounter. This can really be      frustrating to owners who need a horse shipped yesterday.      But believe me, the reasons behind these laws have      far-reaching implications.    </p>    <p>      This summer/fall we had a disease called vesicular      stomatitis (v.s.), spread across the Southwestern United      States. This disease mainly effected only hoofed creatures      causing oral blisters and general malaise. Thankfully this      disease wasn't lethal, but it was economically crippling.      The beef, dairy and horse industries suffered major      setbacks.    </p>    <p>      Primary means of spread of v.s. were insect vectors and      direct contact with infected livestock. The most effective      means of controlling the spread of v.s. was through      quarantine and health-inspection requirements. Some states,      like Kentucky, prohibited movement of horses into the      state, period. There were threats that many livestock      markets would also shut down in order to halt the epidemic.      As you can see, veterinary health inspection is not an idle      pursuit. It not only protects your animals and those who      move them, but also protects the livestock industry as a      whole. The key to a successful move is getting an early      start. Contact your vet at least one week prior to      shipment. Don't forget to ask about regulations like brand      inspection, too. If you can prepare ahead of time, your      move should go without a hitch. Good luck, and enjoy your      new horse!    </p>    <p>      We have a few Hereford cattle and we'd like to get a cattle      dog. What's the best way for us to decide what kind of dog      to get? Are some cattle dogs or sheep dogs easier to train      than others? I've heard that Australian Shepherds are      temperamental with children. Is this true?    </p>    <p>      -Evelyn Townsend<br />      Hedrick, IA    </p>          <p>      Your questions are very valid, and it is good to see      someone doing her homework before acquiring any dog. There      are many breeds of dogs for working livestock. The three      most popular in my area are the Australian shepherd      (Aussie), the Australian cattle dog (Heeler), and the      Border collie. Any one of these can be used for sheep or      cattle if properly trained. Classically, Heelers are used      for cattle, Border collies for sheep and Aussies for either      cattle or sheep. A good dog starts with basic obedience:      sit, stay, come, no etc. Many working dogs are trained to      respond to whistle commands or other strange sounds or      words that indicate direction, speed, or aggressiveness.      The bottom line for having them actually be helpful is      obedience. I don't care how much your dog loves to work      livestock, if you don't control him, he will only be a      disappointment.    </p>    <p>      I don't think you can label Aussies as temperamental with      children. Any of these sensitive working dogs can be      temperamental with anyone. On the other hand, any of these      breeds can make wonderful family pets, too. A lot depends      on their breeding and how they are raised. I personally      have a Heeler and an Aussie, as well as a 3-year-old      daughter. My Aussie, who is just a pup, is learning      manners, but her basic nature is a very happy, friendly      sort. You must start with good temperament and keep      enforcing the type of behavior you want.    </p>    <p>      When you think you are ready to commit to owning a working      dog, there are many things to consider other than breed. Do      I get a puppy or an adult, purebred or cross? Do I train it      or have it professionally trained? Sex of the animal has      never made a difference to me, but neutering and spaying      do. A "fixed" dog will be a lot easier to own (and usually      train), due to the fact that you have eliminated one of the      dog's strongest instincts-reproduction. I have seen some      fabulous "intact" dogs, but I would leave these in the      hands of professionals and folks who understand the      seriousness of breeding dogs.    </p>    <p>      Puppies are a joy and a lot of work. You can mold them to      your specifications, however. Also, aggression towards      people usually shows up early and can be corrected. Adults      can be easier to own, but sometimes their past upbringing      won't be compatible with what you have in mind. Retraining      can be difficult, but it can be accomplished. My Heeler is      a reconditioned model. He was horrible when I got him; he      seemed to always be looking for trouble. He represents what      happens to a lot of working dogs. Working dogs tend to be      very intelligent and active. If not given a job, they will      often go and find their own work. Many Heelers, Aussies,      and Border collies will work children, cats, chickens,      etc., by nipping or chasing them. They also tend to be      "mouthy" so provide many chew toys; otherwise, they will      find couches, chairs or your favorite boots to chew on.    </p>    <p>      You must be there to discipline their behavior and you must      be consistent every time. Never let them work animals at      their leisure, only when you are there to direct them.      Before any work on live animals is started, they must be      unsurpassed in obedience. Working with them daily on just      "sit, stay, come" will pay off when it is time to move      livestock. Also, when you work with them daily, it gives      them something to do rather than thinking up their own      activities. If you do not think your dog is learning the      way he should, get help from a professional trainer. Dogs      are like people. Some learn easily and some need      alternative methods to get the ideas across. You can find      good and bad students in every breed.    </p>    <p>      Other breeds that might be of interest to you are:      rottweilers, originally bred to work cattle; Great      Pyrenees, sheep guardians; or Australian kelpies, very      intelligent and hard working. Do not be afraid to shop      around. These animals are a commitment, but the right one      will be a joy and honor to own.    </p>    <p>      Last year we thought our cow was having difficulty calving,      so we had our vet come out. He lives 30 minutes away and by      the time he arrived, our cow had already given birth. Our      horse is due this spring. How will we know when the vet      should be called? We don't want to seem overprotective, but      we don't want to lose a baby or the mother, either. What      warning signs should we look for when it comes time for our      animals to give birth?    </p>    <p>      -Sreplien Eckert<br />      La Veta, CO    </p>    <p>      It always pays off to be well informed and prepared when      anticipating parturition (birthing). Dystocia (difficult      birthing) can be dealt with systematically in animals and      not all species are treated the same.    </p>    <p>      In cattle dystocias are fairly common. Luckily, a cow or      heifer can go for some time without risking the life of the      calf or mother. Horses, on the other hand, rarely have      dystocias, but when they do, it almost always requires the      assistance of a veterinarian. In order to know when a vet      should be summoned, we need to understand the different      stages of labor.    </p>    <p>      Stage I, cervical dilation, usually lasts two to six hours      in cows and other small ruminants. In horses the time is      much less, probably two to three hours from the first signs      until the breaking of the amniotic sac. Litter-bearing      animals (pigs, etc.) usually have a four- to five-hour      Stage 1. Signs associated with this stage are: attempts at      seclusion, colic or agitation, and the loss of the cervical      plug.    </p>    <p>      Stage II is the actual delivery of the baby. In cows signs      of Stage II labor are abdominal pressing (visible      straining), restlessness, and protrusion of fetal membranes      from the vulva. Stage II in cows is initiated when fetal      parts contact the birth canal and dilated cervix. In most      cows, once the amniotic sac is visible, delivery will ensue      within two hours. If membranes are visible for longer than      two hours without delivery, a vet should be called.    </p>    <p>      In most instances Stage II is interrupted because the calf      is in the wrong position. The most correct position for      calves and foals is to have both front hooves coming first      with the nose and head closely following. Most cows will      strain for two or three minutes then rest two or three      minutes. If the resting periods are lengthening (20-30      minutes) without any signs of progress, the cow should be      examined.    </p>    <p>      Common causes for inappropriate Stage II labor are: legs or      head not presented correctly, tail coming first, or calves      coming upside down. Many heifers have difficulty birthing      due to inadequate dilation of the cervix and calves too      large for the birth canal. If you feel comfortable      repositioning calves and pulling them, remember to limit      your efforts to only about 30 minutes. If you can't      reposition and extract the calf in this time, a Cesarean      section may be in order. Also, when pulling calves, don't      apply pressure greater than three strong men. Improper use      of "calf jacks" can injure both calf and mother. A calf can      survive about eight to 10 hours once Stage II labor has      started. Don't waste too much time if you know problems      exist. It has been shown that the longer a cow spends in      labor, the longer it will take her to normalize and come      back in heat after birthing.    </p>    <p>      The end of Stage I labor in horses is usually noted by the      expulsion of two to five gallons of fluid. This event,      termed breaking water, is usually followed by a 1015 minute      period during which the amniotic sac and foal's feet will      become visible through the vulva. If the amnion or feet are      not visible after the appearance of chorioallantoic fluid,      a vet should be notified. If you need to delay labor while      waiting for a vet, you may walk the mare to prevent further      foaling. Foals survive one to two hours after Stage II      labor starts. Indeed, you must act quickly if you suspect      dystocia in the mare.    </p>    <p>      If feet and amnion appear in the normal time, labor usually      progresses normally. A mare will usually lie down for Stage      II labor when the foal is delivered. This process takes      only 15 minutes in most mares. Any delay could mean a      malpositioned foal and veterinary assistance should be      summoned at once.    </p>    <p>      In both cattle and horses, the placenta is usually expelled      15 minutes to an hour following delivery. Retention of      membranes beyond six to nine hours would require veterinary      care. Examining the rectal and vulva area after delivery is      a good idea, too. It may be purple and swollen, but should      not show signs of hemorrhage or tearing.    </p>    <p>      Preparing yourself and your animals for delivery is      paramount if you wish to avoid complications. Knowing the      exact birth date is helpful, but other signs like increased      mammary size, colostrum secretion, and softening of the      vulva and muscles around the tail area are good indicators      for the impending parturition. You may have to set up a      watching schedule one to two weeks prior to the due date,      especially if the above signs are evident. One can be      fairly lenient in older cows possibly checking every six to      eight hours. In heifers, checking every two or three hours      may be necessary when nearing the due date. Some horse      owners prefer to sleep in the barn with their mares,      especially if the mares are "waxing"- secreting colostrum.      Of course, even the best foal watchers sometimes miss the      great event. Most animals will deliver early in the      morning, say two or three o'clock. I have gone in for a cup      of coffee only to come back and find a healthy foal on the      ground. Just remember that you have more time with cattle      dystocias than with horses; however, cattle tend to have      more dystocias than horses, statistically. If you are      observant and well informed, you should be able to tell      when an animal is in trouble or when things are progressing      normally. Good luck with your babies, you are on the right      track.    </p>    <p>      Is branding with hot irons a cruel practice? Are there      alternatives to branding irons that work? I've heard about      freeze brands, but I also heard they don't last.    </p>    <p>      -Ruth Burwell<br />      Healy, KS    </p>           <p>      Branding with hot irons is an issue that has recently come      to light with the surge of animal rights awareness in this      country. In my opinion, it is not cruel if done correctly      and judiciously. To appreciate why we brand livestock      today, one must look at the roots of this practice. A brand      is like the title to your car. A brand registered in your      name decrees that all cattle and horses wearing this brand      belong to you. If you sell this animal to someone, they      must get a brand inspection, which is similar to a transfer      of title. In areas where cattle are on open range, brands      help distinguish between different owners. In a grazing      association, several different ranches may run their cattle      together. At gathering time, a permanent symbol on the      cattle allows for quick identification of the animals in a      legal manner. In this area of the country (that is,      Colorado and other western states), you may not      sell-or even transport-livestock without a brand      inspection. This deters theft and illegal movement of      cattle.    </p>    <p>      Now, why must hot irons be used instead of other methods?      First, the labeling of cattle must be permanent. Therefore      ear tags, hair colorants, etc., would not work because they      can be altered too easily. Second, the symbol must be      easily visible. Microchips and tattoos are great ideas, but      impractical from an economic as well as a labor standpoint.      Most cattle are not handled as easily as horses or dogs.      Imagine scanning 5,000 head of wild cattle at a sale yard      in an eight hour day; a brand can be identified at a glance      and at a distance.    </p>    <p>      Freeze branding is easily read but does tend to fade with      time. The problem here is the practicality of applying the      brand. Many operations brand cattle out on the range.      Sometimes access to rangeland may prohibit hauling liquid      nitrogen needed for freeze branding. Also, liquid nitrogen      may not be readily available in some parts of the country,      but fire is. Another problem with freeze brands is the      cattle must be dark haired in order for the brand to show.      Freezing doesn't destroy the hair follicle, just the      pigment production. You would not be able to see a freeze      brand on Charlais or other light-haired cattle.      Furthermore, if you wanted to destroy the hair follicle so      a dark symbol appeared, you would have to freeze the skin      for a greater length of time. This in itself is stressful      and painful to the cattle. Freeze branding is also not      recognized as a legal mark in some states.    </p>    <p>      Branding with hot irons evolved from convenience and      practicality. We brand our new calves each spring. While it      is true that the calves bawl momentarily when a hot iron is      applied, they do not seem to be in pain once turned loose.      Remember, cattle hide is several millimeters thick compared      with our skin. Also, the number of nerve-endings is far      fewer per square centimeter than in most other animals. A      correctly applied brand leaves a smooth, hairless scar. If      the iron is applied too cold or too quickly, blisters form.      Blisters can form open wounds leading to avenues for      infection and discomfort. If they arise, the hot iron      should be superimposed and reapplied to the area. Actually,      once the initial brand is laid second applications do not      seem to cause discomfort. A correctly applied brand really      is no more painful than a vaccination or an ear tag.    </p>    <p>      Branding is really only necessary for those who run large      herds of cattle, where the possibility of theft or mixing      with other herds exists. In fact, brand inspection laws are      really only enforced in a few western states. In those      states even cattle not branded may receive a brand      inspection to be sold or transported. The decision to brand      or not to brand is in the hands of the owner. If you only      have a few head of cattle, it may be unnecessary-as well as      impractical-to brand. For those who have many animals or      those who graze them with others, hot-iron branding is      still the most practical and legal means of marking cattle.    </p>
