                    <p>      <strong><strong>A tool kit for self-sufficiency in auto      maintenance and repair.</strong></strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By John Vivian</h5>		<p>Illustrations By Barry Ross</p>        <p>      I hear a lot of new-to-the-country people claim that they      enjoy working with wood or garden seedlings, feel      compatible with the warmth and vibrancy of life, but are      put off by engines...by inanimate metal. I felt that way,      too, when I first quit the city for a life on the land.      Fossil-powered machinery seemed contrary to the      earthly values that motivated me, and engine exhaust and      the humming of gears were too reminiscent of city smog and      clatter.    </p>    <p>      But once hard reality skinned the romantic gloss off      country life, I came to realize that, just as a modern      farmer is as much or more heavy-equipment operator/mechanic      as husbander of the land, self-sufficient country living is      as much keeping trucks and tractors running as it is      gardening or cutting firewood.    </p>    <p>      Country life is by definition lived far from town and from      convenient services like auto repair shops. But this very      distance makes us even more dependent on reliable vehicles      than townsmen. Perversely, a major objective of country      self-sufficiency is freedom from the consumerist rat      race-in particular, $45 per hour, often unreliable auto      repair services. We keep our engines running ourselves.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>An Approximation of Life</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      And there is a satisfaction to maintaining machines. They      aren't alive, but they approximate life in their mechanical      way with metal-on-metal components running at high speeds      and high temperatures... prevented from grinding one      another into iron filings only by precision tolerances and      a thin film of oil or grease. Auto work consists of      replenishing those lubricants, refining fine tolerances      between moving parts, and replacing worn components before      they fail (and leave you stranded at night, 50 miles from      home, in a raging snow storm). The tasks include raising      heavy weights to work on what's in or under them, and      removing, adjusting, and replacing metal, plastic, and      rubber parts. To do the work you need tools to grip the      fasteners that hold the parts together plus jacks, hoists,      and ramps to elevate the work, and a place to get it all      done most efficiently.    </p>    <p>      The equipment is different from common household and      woodworking tools, but choosing and using it is as      satisfying as any other hand craft. Following is my list of      tools a countryman needs to keep the homestead wheels      turning reliably. Not that you should expect to overhaul      engines or change transmissions in a home shop ...unless      auto mechanics becomes a paying trade or personal      avocation. The time and expense of obtaining the      specialized equipment and skills of a mechanic are too      great for servicing a single old farm truck, the passenger      car, and your garden tractor. However, using the equipment      that I'll describe for a conscientious program of      preventive maintenance and minor repairs should go a long      way to assure that you'll seldom, if ever, have to      perform-or pay to have a pro perform-really major      vehicular surgery.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>First Things First</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      In more than 30 years of busting knuckles on my cars,      trucks, tractors, and assorted farm machinery-I have never      yet had the one "tool" that is most desirable: a      weather-tight, heated garage with a concrete floor. A lot      of work is performed lying flat on your back under the      vehicle. Doing so in mid-winter on wide-spaced barn      floorboards is mighty chilly. Doing it on a dirt floor that      melts into three inches of greasy mud in spring is worse.    </p>    <p>      Plus, drive-on ramps to raise a vehicle's front end for oil      changes, hydraulic floor jacks that hold heavy axles off      the floor for tire changing and brake work and jack stands      needed for more serious underchassis jobs will sink into      mud and wobble dangerously on uneven old boards. And, in      case you learn to enjoy auto-repair work and want to      attempt really major jobs (like me), you'll find that      transmission jacks and engine cranes needed to handle the      heaviest components of a vehicle won't move at all on dirt      or boards. Neither will "creepers," those low platforms      with castors that mechanics use to glide around      effortlessly under a car. (Laying plank "roads" over      rough-board floors or sinking planks into the dirt will      work-sort of-but a truly flat and level floor is better.)    </p>    <p>      So, save your pennies for a concrete floored garage, or put      hard-floored, sheltered motor vehicle workspace right up      there with a big garden area and a weathertight stock barn      on the list of features you look for in a new country      place.    </p>    <p>      Second to a hard floor on my list of priorities is a      battery charger and a heavy-duty extension cord long enough      to reach from the vehicle's parking place to a convenient      household or barn electrical outlet, plus at least one free      standing battery maintained in good, fresh, and fully      charged condition (kept indoors in winter), and a set of      jumper cables. I don't know how many times I've come out,      already late for an appointment in town, only to find a      vehicle with a stone-dead battery-occasionally from a short      in the wiring or suddenly defunct battery, but usually from      headlights left on overnight, a car door left ajar and the      dome light on all weekend, or just from sitting unused for      too long.    </p>    <p>      It is time-consuming and embarrassing to have to telephone      a neighbor to bring his truck over to give you a start, and      if you must call out a service truck from town, it's      expensive to boot. Unless you have and are willing to      abuse-another vehicle for a jump start, you'll need a spare      12-volt battery or batteries, plus a way to charge them,      and jumper cables to transfer juice from the spare battery      to the dead battery in your vehicle.    </p>    <p>      Often, severe cold will reduce a battery's efficiency; when      I need to start a vehicle in sub-zero weather, I routinely      hook up jumpers and a fully charged spare battery carried      out from the warmth of the house.    </p>    <p>      A good-enough spare battery will cost $10 used from a      junkyard and $30 new from the auto section of any discount      mall store. Or better, get a fresh, new, top-quality      battery for the truck. Clean up its existing old      but-still-good battery for emergency use.    </p>    <p>      To spark your vehicles, get Exide, Delco, or another brand      name you recognize, or buy from a local retailer you trust.      Like tires, conventional lead acid batteries are still      relatively low-tech and easy to make, so fly-by-nighters      can cobble them together. But they aren't easy to make with      consistent reliability, and poorly built connectors inside      el cheapos can develop shorts between cells.    </p>    <p>      Get a five year-warrantied battery and plan to replace it      after four years. Be sure the purchase date is punched into      the tag on the battery, and put the sales slip/warranty in      a safe place so you can get a prorated refund if the      battery fails prematurely.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Jumpers and Chargers</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Don't waste money on a set of mall store-cheap jumper      cables with thin six-gauge or even "heavy-duty" four-gauge      copper cable. They will waste much of the starting      battery's power through electrical resistance, and can heat      up and possibly harm your vehicles. Go to an auto parts      supplier like NAPA, or look in a mail order catalog and      invest as much as $65 in 15- to 25-foot, really thick,      two-gauge cables with rust-resistant, zinc-plated, even      jawed 500 amp-clamps at each end.    </p>    <p>      A charger is a simple 120VAC-to-12VDC transformer that has      no moving parts, and it needn't be fancy; a little $20 mall      store version will slow-charge any battery overnight. Be      sure it is designed for large auto size 12-volt batteries,      not little motorcycle or snowmobile batteries. However, a      better charger for about $50 will shut off automatically to      prevent overcharge and can develop a good 7.5- or 10amp      surge to perk up a battery that is not completely run down      in just a few minutes. With a quick top-charge you can      often be on your way and let the alternator finish the      battery-charging job while you are on the road. To keep      stored batteries charged, you can get plug-in or      solar-powered trickle chargers for about $15.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Tire Care</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Third essential is a tire-changing/repair kit: a good jack      and wheel-lug wrench, a tire-repair kit, and an air      compressor. Country roads and drives are loaded with nails,      glass, and "sharps" of all kinds-all of 'em yearning to      puncture a tire. As often as you find a dead battery in the      morning, you'll find a dead-flat tire-or more often, one      that's half down from a slow leak: a small puncture or one      still partly sealed by the object that did the damage.    </p>    <p>      First, get some Fix-A-Flat-spray-paint-type cans of      compressed air plus a sealant that will repair most flats      long enough to get you home or to a service station. Keep      one in each vehicle's trunk or glove compartment for road      flats.    </p>    <p>      Get a good jack as well. The crummy little bumper jacks      that come with most vehicles are for emergencies only. Get      a $20, 4-ton hydraulic hand-jack and a $10 "+"-shaped,      four-socket lug wrench for each vehicle and if you can      afford it, a $100+ wheeled trolley-type floor jack if you      have a concrete floor shop. The handjacks have a screw      extension that will raise them high enough above the floor      to reach most any vehicle's axle. But, the longer they are,      the less stable. I have several footsquare x 2inch-thick      oak blocks to raise the jack off the ground so it needs      only to be pumped a few times to do its job. The blocks      also provide a firm, stable base in snow or on soft ground.    </p>    <p>      Also, get several awl-and-rubber-string flat-fixer kits      that repair most punctures in modern tubeless tires. You      brush soap suds over the tire; bubbles will point out the      puncture. Then, usually without removing the wheel from the      car, you can dig out the nail, thread a length of gum      rubber through the eye in the awl's pointed end, work it      into the puncture, and fix the tire for good and ever.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Pressurized Air</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      I recommend keeping a little $20 mall store mini air      compressor in your vehicle. They plug into the cigarette      lighter and are slow to inflate a road flat, but are      reliable. For shop use, though, everyone should have a      large line-powered compressor.    </p>    <p>      A compressor's capability is rated by the cubic feet of air      it can move constantly at a given pressure. A gas or      electric motor powers a pump that pushes air into a steel      pressure vessel, shutting off and turning on automatically      to maintain the pressure set by a pair of valves-one to set      the tank pressure and one for pressure in the air hose.    </p>    <p>      Air-flow is determined by the tool in use. A tire will      inflate happily with any pump that can develop 100 pounds      of pressure in a closed vessel (such as a tire or football)      with minimal air flow. To operate normal-duty air-powered      mechanic's tools, however, requires constant output of a      minimum four cubic feet per minute at 90 psi.-an entirely      different proposition demanding dimensionally greater      power.    </p>    <p>      However, high-capacity compressors are expensive, and for      more than 25 years I kept tires inflated and blew out fuel      lines and gummed-up carburetors with a chugchugging old      piston-pump on an ancient electric motor that I hooked to      an old propane tank. It took forever to get up to 50 or 60      pounds of pressure, but served the use.    </p>    <p>      The best small compressor I have found for sale today is      Black & Decker's Air Station Inflator/Compressor, a      high-speed, small displacement electric pump that develops      tire pressure quickly and sells for under $50. If mated      with a small portable air tank (about $30), it would make a      good basic farmstead air supply for occasional use.    </p>    <p>      You'll pay $150 minimum for a constant-use,      pressure-switch-equipped compressor on a big, wheeled tank.      More powerful, more easily carried are compact, somewhat      lighter-weight professional models used by painters. With      two small tanks, or pressurized air contained in a tubular      frame-they cost $250 minimum A set of the four or five most      popular tools in small homeowner-size and okay quality      costs another $120. My compressor and tools are made by      Campbell -Hausfield, a low-to-medium-price brand found      everywhere-in mail-order catalogs, the auto departments of      Sears/J.C. Penney/Ward type stores and in larger home      centers and hardware stores.    </p>    <p>      Once you have air, you'll never know how you functioned      without it. A high pressure compressed-air gun will blast      dirt out of spark plug sockets and brake drums, clean out      foot wells and luggage space, will unclog carburetor jets      and fuel lines ...as well as fill the kids' bike tires (if      you are very careful not to over inflate them), plus      inflatable boats and air mattresses, soccer balls and more.    </p>    <p>      In the shop, an air-powered impact wrench will remove      frozen lug nuts and ease tire changing greatly; an air      hammer, die grinder and rotary disc grinder will speed      blacksmithing and body work; an air-powered ratchet-wrench      will remove stuck or rusted nuts or studs; an air chisel      will cut rusted-together exhaust pipes; and the compressor      can power paint guns for autos as well as paint and stain      the house, squirt wasp nest remover into the eaves, and do      much more around the home and barn. For less cost than its      equivalent electrical counterpart, you can get nearly any      tool in air-power: circular and reciprocating saws, metal      shears, lube-guns, sandblasters and high-pressure-sprayers.    </p>    <p>      The individual tools, a set of black-steel sockets for the      impact wrench, a 50-foot length of air hose, and a set of      couplers will cost between $25 and $50. All told, equipping      yourself with good homeowner quality"air" and the tools to      fit will set you back $400 to $600. Northern Hydraulics is      the best mail-order source I have found for compressors and      air tools.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Electric Power Tools</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Lacking "air," you'll find that many of the      electric-powered hand-held tools used in woodworking and      farmstead maintenance will find a use in the auto shop. If      they tend to stay there, buy one for the shop only. A      high-power, V-drive highspeed electric hand drill is      essential and a bench-mounted drill press is helpful; you      can get a rugged if inelegant imported 8" travel-drill      press and a 3" drill press-vise to hold work on its 6"wide      table for under $100-a real bargain considering what it can      do.    </p>    <p>      You'll want a set of good quality high-speed drill bits.      Avoid those metal boxes of cheap imports that come in      dozens of X.," sizes you'll never need. They don't last      long in metal. Do keep a supply of several Yin" bits (even      top-quality, U.S.-made small bits snap easily) two or three      X", Y", and 3/8" bits plus a good-quality V2", a 9/16", and      half inch. You'll also want grinding stones in several      shapes to mill down metal parts as well as steel and brass      wire brushes to remove rust and scale.    </p>    <p>      A major step beyond handheld grind-stones on a drill is a      twin-wheel bench grinder with a coarse stone on one side      and fine-grit on the other. You'll find that you are      constantly shaping metal for all kinds of auto and farm      purposes. Before I got into blacksmithing, I made knives      and garden tools out of saw blades and old spring steel      with nothing but a bench grinder and a hand drill. Went      through a lot of Carborundum...but it worked.    </p>    <p>      Get the largest grinder motor you can manage. Small      fractional-horsepower hardware-store models lack torque to      keep going when the work gets heavy, and their high-rpm      wheel will kick out or chip thin work like knife blades-and      it revolves so fast it can heat metal faster than it grinds      it down. Electric motors last practically forever and a      huge, old, slow-turning, 1hp motor picked up for a few      dollars at a barn sale is ideal even if it needs a spin of      the wheel to get started and takes a while to get up to      speed. Replace an antique power cord if it's a dry and      cracked rubber-insulated wire covered with frayed cloth,      ending in an ancient Bakelite plug.    </p>    <p>      You'll need a sturdy table or work bench to mount the      grinder on, but it needn't be level, square, plumb, and      flat like a woodworking bench. I use an assortment of      oak-plank benches and old (recycled) fiat-faced, solid-wood      entrance doors bolted to the shop wall in back and      supported in front on wood-post legs. The bench should also      hold the biggest steel jawed bench vise you can manage.      Buy, or fabricate from sheet stock, a set of copper vise      jaw-plates to hold plastic and soft metal that would be      marred by the vise's roughly-serrated steel jaws.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Hand Tools</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      All country households have a junk drawer holding (amid the      odd rubber bands, tacks, chewing gum wrappers and outdated      store coupons) an odd assortment of pliers, screwdrivers      and wrenches. Inherited with the house or bought to install      curtain rods and repair leaky water pipes, they seldom have      precision-shaped, hardened-steel jaws or bits suitable for      serious automotive work. Cheap, wrong-sized or ill-shaped      tools will only frustrate you, and can damage the work.    </p>    <p>      Here is my suggested list of hand tools you really need,      some you should have but can live without and some that are      luxuries but worth it if you have a few spare dollars.      Unless otherwise indicated, get the absolute best quality      you can find. Nothing is as sweet as applying the right      tool to a job and having it work. Nothing is more      frustrating than having a sloppily made wrench or socket      slip off a bolt so you bruise your knuckles, or bruise the      head of a nut so you can never again get a good purchase on      it.    </p>    <p>      You must have tools to fit both inch measure and metric      fittings. The world is slowly adopting the universal metric      system, but so long as there are fine old American and      English-made vehicles in service, we'll need tools and      fasteners in inch-measure approved by the Society of      Automotive Engineers (SAE).    </p>    <p>      An all-American/Canadian car should be all-ASAE, a Japanese      vehicle all-metric... in theory. But, in today's global      economy vehicles are assembled from major components made      all over the globe, which in turn may have sub-components      made who knows where. A General Motors truck assembled in      Canada can have an engine assembled in Malaysia Out of U.S.      and Japanese components so you'll have an SAE-made      alternator attached with metric fasteners, an SAE      carburetor fastened to the intake manifold with metric      bolts ...and you need tools and fasteners to fit them all.    </p>    <p>      Wrenches: In time you'll want a full set of combination      wrenches-the kind with an open-front/four-sided crescent      jaw at one end and a closed 12-point box at the other in      SAE sizes from V," to I 1/2" or 2" in Y,,,inch increments      and metrics in sizes from 4mm to 20mm. You'll probably      obtain these in several increments as needed: a set of      mid-sizes to start, angled "ignition wrenches" for the      small sizes, and a set of "tractor wrenches" for the big      ones. Accumulate odd and off-sizes as the need arises.    </p>    <p>      To start, get a basic nine-piece SAE set in 1/4, 5/16, 3/8,      7/16, 1/2, 9/16, 5/8, 11/16, 3/4 inches ...or an 11-piece      set that adds the expensive 7/8 and 1-inch sizes. Metrics      come in comparable sets: 10mm to 19mm to start. I find a      set of thin wrenches invaluable for getting into tight      spots-get them in as many sizes as you can find. Wrenches      in 1/64 " increments, with odd-angle heads, or cres cents,      or closed-sockets at both ends are nice to have, but      unessential for home mechanics. Good-quality 16- or      18-piece sets run about a dollar a wrench. S-K, the premium      U.S.-made professional-quality brand sold by auto supply      outlets, and Snap-On tools sold from trucks that call at      local shops cost more and, arguably, are worth it.    </p>    <p>      It is good to have a set of three or four adjustable      wrenches that will let you change jaw width quickly, and      here be doubly sure to get the finest quality you can.      Sloppily made adjustables slip off nuts and bruise more      knuckles than any other tool I know. Be ready to pay more      than $30 for a topquality set.    </p>    <p>      You will need a set of low-priced monkey wrenches iii three      sizes; get an extra big one too. Plumbers need finely      machined pipe wrenches, but subtlety doesn't matter in auto      repair where these tools are used to apply brute force to      stubborn fasteners. When you can, pick up a length of steel      pipe that will slip over the handle of the large-size      monkey wrench to apply extra leverage-say, to a      recalcitrant axle nut that hasn't come off in 25 years. A      set of three goes for $35.    </p>    <p>      While we are discussing nut-removal tools, get a set of      nut-splitters too to use as a last resort. They cost only      $10 a set and will repay their cost many times the first      time you use them to get a stubborn nut off a stud-a      headless screw with one end sunk into the engine block. If      you put too much force on a nut you can break off a stud      that must then be drilled out. Split the nut and the stud      remains intact.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Ratchet-Handles and      Sockets</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Another tool where quality is essential is the clicking      ratchet-wrench handle with a little forward/backward switch      and socket quick-release button on top, and underneath on      the business side-a square bit that fits into a round      sockets having 6point hexagonal or 12-point universal      mouths in a variety of sizes.    </p>    <p>      Handles must be industrial strength and sockets must be      precision shaped to fit snugly over bolt heads and nuts;      must be drop-forged to hold up to great stress; and be      triple chrome-plated to last for years without rusting. You      can fork over $10 and more for a single socket bought from      Snap-On. Sets are much cheaper, but the expense is      justified; a top-quality socket set will last your lifetime      and pass on to your mechanically inclined daughter without      a nick on them.    </p>    <p>      Handles and socket sets are Categorized by the size of the      square drive bit that holds the sockets. Little 1/4" drive      handles are for working in tight spaces where you don't      need to use much force, and the sets usually come with      small-size sockets. Most of the work you will      do-using small sockets as well those up to      3/4"-will be performed with a 3/8" handle. Half-inch      drive handles and sockets are for when major force must be      applied (sometimes to small sockets over small nuts). Even      larger drives are needed to work on farm tractors,      18-wheelers and industrial equipment. I have never needed a      3/4" -or 1" drive handle or sockets badly enough to spend      the megabucks they cost. So far, I've found that a monkey      wrench works on the big jobs.    </p>    <p>      Start off with a 3/8" drive handle and basic socket set for      $20 to $30. Then, get 1/4", and finally the most expensive      (and least used), 1/2".    </p>    <p>      Sockets come in regular and deep lengths. You may want a      set of deep sockets to remove nuts cinched down over      protruding studs or bolts when you gain experience. But      most nuts will come off and go on with less expensive      regular (shallow) sockets-in the same sizes as      aforementioned wrenches.    </p>    <p>      You will also need 3/8" drive spark ping sockets in two      common automotive sizes: 5/8" and 13/16". These are deep      hex-sockets that slip all the way down over spark plugs.      They contain rubber inserts at the top to hold plugs'      delicate ceramic insulators.    </p>    <p>      Sets are the cheapest way to buy sockets and      ratchet-handles. But if your 3/8" set Contains all 12-point      sockets, buy snuggerfit ting hex-head shaped sockets in      most used sizes: 1/4-, 3/8-,5/16, 1/2" and 9/16". Also, get      a three-piece set of extension rods in all bit sizes. And,      get 1/4 - to 3/8- and 3/8- to 1/2" adapters so you can use      one size socket in another driver.    </p>    <p>      Finally, be sure you have sockets or box wrenches that fit      the square-headed drain plugs in your vehicle's engine oil      pan and transmission. Removing these brass or softsteel      fittings continually with adjustables will eventually turn      the plug heads round. If the differential has drain plugs      with square holes rather than protruding heads, get a      differential-plug wrench or socket to fit. To remove the      really tough nuts, get a "T"bar with a sliding 1/2" drive      bit or a long, cushion-handled flex bar with a pivoting      1/2" drive bit on the end, but no ratchet.    </p>    <p>      Unless you are more careful than 1, you will forever be      dropping tools down into your vehicle's dark places-and the      little ones don't always go through to the floor or lodge      somewhere visible. My truck has a small fortune in sockets      and bits lodged in its crannies. I suggest that if you live      really far from town, you buy duplicates of most used small      wrenches and sockets, or get back-up sets of rack-sold      super cheapos.    </p>    <p>      It can be more convenient to remove a threaded fastener      with a waggling back and forth hand motion rather than      round-and-round, and there are many places where you will      appreciate having an open socket for the ratchet-handles      that will accept screwdriver bits.    </p>    <p>      Screwdrivers    </p>    <p>      Time was when you needed screwdrivers with full shafts and      handles in all sizes for the only slot-headed fasteners we      had: standard straight-slot (where you have to rotate the      handle a full 180 degrees for each new bite) and Phillips      head where you only need rotate your wrist a more      convenient 90 degrees. Auto manufacturers discovered that      if the 4-point X-shaped Phillips head made screw-fastening      on the assembly line marginally faster, 6- and 8point      star-shaped drives went on and off the work faster still,      while deep, square bits will hold a screw on the tool so it      can be inserted one handed. So now we have a whole variety      of drive bits. Most common are TORX-with a shallow,      round-bottomed hole with eight or so tiny little points      around the edge. You find them holding on inside and      outside trim of vehicles and the pits are so shallow they      bruise if you try removing them with ordinary drivers.    </p>    <p>      Buy regular shaft-and-handle screwdriver sets in the most      frequently used sizes of regular and Phillips bits. Get      top-quality, long- and short-handled drivers in as big a      set as you can find; driver bits vary in width and      thickness to precisely fit different sizes of screw head.      The more drivers in a set, the smaller will be the      difference between one and the next, so the tighter can be      your driver-to-fitting fits. Ill-fitting driver bits will      ruin screw heads.    </p>    <p>      I use Stanley screwdrivers purchased at discount from the      mall. The quality can't be beat and the handles are sized,      shaped, and colored differently for various sizes and      between Standard and Phillips ...so you can grab the      correct driver by feel or by looking at the handle, rather      than peering through the under-chassis gloom at the tiny      little bit end. My favorites also have slight ridges on the      bits and are magnetized so they hold screws one-handed.    </p>    <p>      But for TORX and the other peculiarities, you can buy a      handle-and-bit set from the mall. Driver bits of all kinds      are made to fit into a single handle/holder with a      magnetized hex-socket or put in an electric drill. Get a      set that contains with V,"- and V-drive sockets to hold the      bits as well, so you can manipulate the bits with your      ratchets. The few bits that you use often for me, Phillips      heads used to drive drywall screws in woodworking-will      bruise quickly, but you can get replacements.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Odd Bits</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      One type of specialized star-bit that comes on 3/8" drive      sockets is essential to remove the bolts that hold on some      Ford and GM front brake calipers from the stone blind      backside (so you can't see to use imprecise bits). In my      experience, they are impossible to find for sale anywhere      in time and space but in the JC Whitney catalog: stock#      13NT5588U for $8.99. While you are at it, order a Seal      Driver Kit: #13NT21098 for $19.99, with 16 adapters so you      can insert grease seals into front axles, tranny's, and      crankshafts evenly and easily without ruining the seal or      bearing, losing tube, or all three. If your car is a late      model, you may also find "E"-series starbolts in odd      places, and will need an eight-piece socket set: JCW      #12NT7319T for $14.99.    </p>    <p>      Also, get a full 18-piece set of "hexkeys"six-sided      bare-metal shafts bent 90 degrees at one end, which you'll      need to loosen set screws that hold keepers and pulleys on      shafts. You don't need them often, but you need them      absolutely when you need them at all. They must be of hard,      but springy steel. Mall store versions will bend and bruise      in a single use, so get better quality from Sears or NAPA.      Get an assortment of the little headless, pointy-ended      set-screws, too. Tiny, they are easily lost.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Pliers</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Stanley also makes top-quality pliers that you can find at      reasonable prices at the mall. Get a set of regular      rivet-joint adjustables, a set of mechanic's pliers with      needle nose, side-cutting, and slip-joint designs in      regular and small sizes. Lock-grips in three sizes are      essential, but name brands are expensive and el cheapos      work fine for the brute holding jobs they are designed for.      Snap-ring pliers have little pins that poke into holes at      the ends of spring-steel rings you'll find hidden away      holding small parts in place, and that can't be removed      with any other tool. Get a cheap four-piece set-and get an      assortment of snap-rings with it. The rings are springy and      tend to snap off the pliers and fly away, never to be seen      again.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Ramps</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Probably the best solution to simple under-chassis work      like changing oil is to drive only four-wheel-drive or      high-wheel trucks with little ground clearance. Lower      vehicles must be jacked up.    </p>    <p>      But, never get under a vehicle that is supported only by a      jack-mechanical car hydraulic. All jacks eventually let go.    </p>    <p>      To raise low autos off the ground for oil changes and      front-end tube, buy or build a set of drive-on ramps. Steel      ramps work fine if appropriately sized to the vehicle and      anchored securely to the floor. One-piece, $20-economy      models from the mall are okay for small economy cars. For      full-size vehicles, spend $50 for heavy-drm two-piece      ramps. If you have a concrete floor, clean it of oil and be      sure the ramp, grip the surface well. If working on bar c      ground, remove spongy sod under ramp.,, tamp underlying      soil firm, and level and anchor ramps with blocks or rocks.      Shin them level and lag-bolt them securely ii you have a      wood floor. I place concrete car wooden blocks under the      front axle beside the ramps to catch the car in case the      ramps tip or slide.    </p>    <p>      To support a vehicle by its axles, you need sturdy,      adjustable jack stands. 'these are even tippier than ramps,      and must he set on a firm, level surface. I place concrete      blocks beside them as a safety measure. For advanced work,      you will want wheeled engine and transmission jacks or a      block-and-tackle suspended from the roof on chains or a      trolley, but that's a ways down the road for me, and I      presume for you as well.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      You will need a hacksaw with a supply of metal-cutting      blades, hammers in several sizes, a set of metal-cutting      chisels, and a set of aligning punches (to poke through      bolt holes so you can insert bolts through adjoining      parts). Also, bolt cutters, a putty knife, and metal files      in flat and round shapes and several diameters. From the      local auto supply outlet get an inexpensive spark plug gap      tool, and if you think you'll be going onto engines, get a      set of flat-steel feeler gauges and a torque wrench.    </p>    <p>      Buying bolts and nuts, hose clamps, and gaskets singly from      a hardware store is expensive-and they stock only American      coarse and SAE fine threads in mild steel. You will want      SAE and metric, steel and brass, "T" nuts, "O" rings,      gaskets material and more-in all sizes. Auto supply outlets      stock them, but I suggest saving money and many a drive to      town for a single nut, bolt, or washer by ordering packaged      hardware assortments from the mail order catalogs. Not      "1,001 (low-grade) fasteners for $51.11," but good quality      fasteners in small lots.    </p>    <p>      You will want a good-quality hand operated grease gun and      cartridges of axle grease and white grease. Buy a good      brand of engine oil by the case of cans and recycle the      cans. Get squeezable plastic bottles of gear lube that you      can squirt in sideways, an assortment of funnels, including      one with a long goose neck to use to add fluids in awkward      locations. Often you must fabricate a funnel for a tight      squeeze; I cut what I need from a roll of 12"-wide aluminum      flashing. (You'll need tin snips to do that.)    </p>    <p>      When antifreeze is on sale in July, get a case. Also small      funnel-tipped and spray cans of penetrating oil and light      machine oil, and a can of hard bearing grease.    </p>    <p>      A pop-riveter with a variety of rivet sizes and metals is      good to have, though real body shop tools are not common in      farm shops. Do get a propane torch, several bottles of      propane, and a spark starter. Heating will free up most      rusted on nuts, (and will thaw frozen pipes in the house      cellar, start charcoal in the barbecue, and more.)    </p>    <p>      For electrical work, get a selection of solid and stranded      hookup wires, a multimeter and a stripping/clinching tool,      and a variety of spade lugs and electrical fasteners.    </p>    <p>      Finally, keep a supply of tapes and wire. Get electrical      tape in ordinary black-plastic and shrink-tape, masking      tape and the most useful of all: Duct Tape. Don't get      "Duck" Tape from the mall, but professional, metalized Duct      Tape that contractors use to seal seams on a sheet metal      hot-air heating duct. Get wire in soft steel and brass and      in several gauges.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Sources</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      I hope you find a country place that comes complete with a      beginning mechanic's heaven: a barn with an undisturbed      old-time-farm machine shop in back. You'll find massive      screw jacks, jacks, and pry bars, huge old crescent      wrenches, blacksmith's tools, nut and bolt assortments,      ancient magnetos and kerosene burning carburetors,      oil-soaked orange crates and wooden cigar boxes full of      parts accumulated over several lifetimes of working on farm      machinery.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>BE WARY OF AUCTIONS: Too many people end up      catching "bidding fever" and finish the day paying more for      tools than if they went to a department      store.</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Otherwise, you can look for old tools at barn sales, tag      sales, and yard sales in country towns. Be wary of      auctions; you can contract a case of bidding fever and end      up overpaying several times what an item is worth. Often,      you'll find unorganized assortments of rusty but restorable      old tools, nails and bolts, old iron and whatnot jumbled in      crates, and you can walk off with the lot for a dollar or      two.    </p>    <p>      Avoid buying no-name or house-brand tool sets from mall      stores. Dimensions are liable to be sloppy, corners rounded      and steel soft. Wal-Mart and other mass merchandisers label      tools with familiar sounding names like Popular Mechanix      and Master Mechanic, but suppliers change and quality      varies.    </p>    <p>      Any time you see the distinctive yellow-and-black Stanley      label, you can be confident of quality. The company's hand      tools are often the most expensive on a mall-store rack,      but are fine quality no matter where it's purchased. The      top line of Sears Craftsman brand (it has two or more      quality levels) is also excellent quality and any Sears      retail store will honestly replace any hand tool that      breaks. A couple of years ago, I found what must have been      a 30year-old Craftsman ratchet-handle in the road. It was      gutted-its innards, dial, bit and pawls, and all, had      somehow gotten busted out. I took it to town and was given      the equivalent currently manufactured (top-of-the-line)      model in trade instantly, with no paperwork, argument, or      hassle, no appeal to the supervisor or even the computer.      Tools from NAPA and other auto supply stores or from      Snap-On trucks are also top quality but are high priced.    </p>    <p>      Magazine merchandisers and the TV home-shopping networks      sometimes sell name brand tools at what seem to be      superbargain prices. In my experience, these are invariably      the bottom lines and of inferior quality to the top lines      that cost relatively little more.    </p>    <p>      Sears, the big auto supply chains, and other      mass-merchandisers sell mechanics' tool assortments at      exaggerated discounts. They can be top quality ...but,      you'll have a thousand bucks invested in tools, half of      which you will never use and another 30 percent of which      you may use once in a lifetime of amateur automotive      repair. And, not even buying a complete mechanic's set will      teach you to be a mechanic.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Mail Order</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Following are the snail-order catalogs that no gear head      can be without. They sell good quality tools at cut-rate      prices and have a larger variety than any retail store.      Catalogs are free.    </p>    <p>      JC Whitney, 1917-19 Archer Ave. PO Box 804719, Chicago IL      60680, 3124316000. "EVERYTHING AUTOMOTIVE," the catalog      reads.
