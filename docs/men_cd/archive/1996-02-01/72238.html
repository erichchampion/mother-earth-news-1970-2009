                <p>      <strong><strong>BITS AND PIECES</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>The most inexpensive lumber you'll ever      find.</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      They dwell behind loading docks, litter shipping yards, and      proliferate in stock rooms around the world. They represent      millions of tons of hardwood each year, and have a service      life of perhaps a few weeks or months. Each year in the      United States alone, there are about 460 million wooden      pallets manufactured, over half of which are discarded      after the first use. Most people simply don't realize that      this otherwise titanic waste could be one of our      eases-and certainly least expensive-sources for      building lumber.    </p>        <p>      The wood used for pallets comprises 10 percent of the      lumber and 50 percent of the hard wood cut down each year      in the United States. It is estimated that the amount of      wood used for pallets is equivalent to the amount of wood      used in the frames of 300,000 average-size American homes.      Although the number produced in most foreign countries does      not match U.S. production, pallets made in Africa, Asia,      and South America often contain endangered tropical woods,      such as mahogany.    </p>    <p>      A fascinating and informative book entitled, not      surprisingly, <em>Fun Projects Using Wooden Pallets,</em>      by Don and Peggy Crissey, has come to the rescue. The      couple, now from Silsbee, Texas, owned a container business      in Fort Myers, Florida, several years ago, where they      bought and sold various types of containers with the main      purpose of recycling them. One day they found a bunch of      decaying wooden pallets inside some ocean cargo containers      they had purchased. They recovered enough lumber from the      pallets to rebuild their front porch.    </p>    <p>      After this undertaking, they continued working with wooden      pallets in virtually every household construction project.      "Discovery consists of looking at the same thing as      everyone else and thinking something different;" explains      Crissey, offering his favorite quote from Nobel prize      winning physician Albert Szent-Gydrgyl.    </p>    <p>      Pallets are most often regarded as junk, because they      frequently have a weathered and tarnished look. But Don and      Peggy contend that simple deck cleaners, costing about $2      per gallon, will make the weathered look vanish      immediately. If you're not thrilled by this approach, a      simple soap-and-water solution and some sandpaper does the      job. There are also some hints to finding pallets      <em>before</em> they become weathered, which we'll leave      for Don and Peggy to explain.    </p>    <p>      Several chapters of the book contain full illustrations of      a variety of building projects including a utility cabinet,      a compost bin, several different furniture creations,      backyard decks, designs for plantscaping, and many more.      Further chapters include tips on building with wooden      pallets and advice on working with wood in general.    </p>    <p>      For more information, or to order a copy of the book      ($12.95, plus $2 shipping and handling), write to Applecart      Press, P .O. Box 612, Silsbee, TX 77656.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jessica Bolson</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>The War of the White      Fly<br /></strong></strong> Insect Photos, Courtesy of      USDA/ARS    </p>        <p>      The sweet potato white fly <em>(Bernisia tabaci),</em>      carrying more than 40 viral diseases, is one of the most      nefarious crop pests in the world, destroying commercial      and home vegetable crops alike, and eating its way through      entire fields if not checked. In the most extreme cases,      the white fly has caused crop yield losses as high as 80      percent to 100 percent. Finding more than 600 varieties of      fruit, vegetable, ornamental, alfalfa, and cotton plants      desirable for feeding, the white fly consumes leaves and      sap, leaving behind partially digested sap and leaf sugars      known as honeydew.    </p>    <p>      To help alleviate losses, the Agricultural Research Service      and the USDA have joined together in search of ecologically      responsible alternatives to get the white fly situation      under control. In places with warmer climates, where the      growing season is year-round, researchers are looking into      fighting the white fly with their own natural enemies, like      the <em>Delphastus pusilus</em> beetle that feeds only on      white flies in all of their stages of development. The      beetle eats several white flies per day and in its six to      nine-week lifetime can consume up to 10,000 eggs or 700      nymphs.    </p>    <p>      Certain wasps native to Florida have also been introduced,      and though a potent enemy of the white fly, proved harmless      to livestock, humans, wildlife or plants and develop within      12 to 14 days. Some wasps sting the white flies and lay      eggs on their undersides. When the eggs hatch, the wasps      feed on the young flies. Others lay their eggs inside the      white fly larvae. Though a promising development, wasps as      natural predators have varying degrees of effectiveness      from crop to crop.    </p>    <p>      The USDA researchers have also tested the effectiveness of      different fungi on killing the flies, finding a strain of      <em>Beauveria bassiana</em> first identified in the 1870s      to be most effective. The fungus spreads through the white      flies' bodies and "eventually the fungus covers the whole      white fly, so it looks just like a little white puff ball,"      says entomologist James E. Wright, who works at the      Subtropical Agricultural research Laboratory in Weslaco,      Texas. Wright developed a fungal formula that is applied to      plants using conventional sprayers or crop dusters.      Originally created to control boll weevils, it has been      effective against white flies as well. In Florida, the      <em>Paecilomyces</em> <em>fu</em> <em>mosoroseus</em>      <em>is</em> under patent to distribute to growers.    </p>    <p>      Time is often a factor in controlling the pest, because      natural, biological controls take longer to act than      chemical pesticides and insecticides. Many farmers have      turned to biosoaps for their quick effectiveness. One      formula made from <em>Nicotania gossei,</em> a relative of      tobacco, forms a detergent compound that is effective in      killing both infant and nymph stages. In one greenhouse      experiment, entomologist John Neal found the soap to be 100      percent effective in controlling white flies, aphids, and      mites.    </p>    <p>      Many of these solutions are already available to commercial      farmers and are just starting to be marketed for the home      gardener. In the mean time, gardeners may want to try a      cost and time efficient homemade method that has been      developed by the Agricultural Research Service    </p>    <p>      <em>Homemade White Fly Pesticide<br /></em> 路 1      tablespoon of dishwashing detergent<br />      路 1 cup of vegetable oil<br />      路 1 cup water<br />      路 spray bottle<br />      <br />      Mix detergent with vegetable oil and shake solution well.      Add one or two tablespoons of solution to one cup of water.    </p>    <p>      Spray solution directly on insects and plants. Check plants      for white flies every week.    </p>    <p>      The solution is recommended for carrots, celery, cucumbers,      eggplant, lettuce, peppers, chard, and watermelon. It may      burn leaves of squash, cauliflower and red cabbage. Wash      your vegetables well before eating.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Heather McGeory</em>    </p>
