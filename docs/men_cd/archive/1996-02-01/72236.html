                <p>      <strong><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>How to sink a pipe and make it stay... almost      forever.</strong>    </p>        <p>      It was with a great deal of interest that I read the piece      submitted by Ms. Carol S. Larson of Harvard, IL dealing      with the utilization of discarded carpet as a permanent      mulch in the garden ["Country Lore," #152]. During the      early and mid 1960s, I assisted my grandmother in her      garden, where carpet was utilized for just the purpose Ms.      Larson speaks of.    </p>    <p>      As a resident of the Blue Ridge foothills here in Northwest      Georgia, I would add one enjoinder to Ms. Larson's      suggestion. Any one who would utilize carpet remnants for      mulch in an area inhabited by venomous members of the      crotalid family would do well to forego any carpet of a      pattern or coloration resembling that of the indigenous      reptiles. My Cisco, Georgia, garden is located next to a      hollow that harbors a spring and a creek. The extremely dry      summer we recently experienced witnessed many a copperhead      and an occasional rattlesnake utilizing the garden for      provender. I have been more successful in avoiding contact      with these fellows since using the polypropylene type      synthetic backing-a material that allows passage of water      and fairly good weed suppression. This material has also      allowed me to rapidly identify those members of the      crotalid family touring my garden and humanely remove them      back to the hollow from whence they came (As a silver      medalist in the Southeast Asia War Games of 1960 through      1975, I am reluctant to dispatch any creature for merely      being itself.).    </p>    <p>      Thank you for an extremely informative publication.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Joseph R. Dombroski<br />      Chatsworth, GA</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Setting a Lean-proof Post</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      The usual technique for planting fence posts is fairly      standard, whether for 4x4s or 6x6s or round posts. Dig a      hole and throw a little gravel or concrete in the bottom.      Then insert the post, plumbing it while adding more gravel      or concrete to the hole. Easy enough.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes, however, a post needs to be especially rigid and      well-anchored, able to resist a lot of lateral stress.      These might include lone gate posts, corners and some sign      posts having horizontal, load-bearing arms. Here's a      sure-fire method of installation that adds a new wrinkle to      the usual procedure, and will prevent a post from      eventually loosening or leaning.    </p>    <p>      To begin, drive a stake at least 6 inches deep at the      center of the post hole location. Then, digging all around      the stake, excavate a circular "form" hole, 24-28 inches in      diameter and approximately 5 inches deep. At the center of      this shallow, dish shape hole (the spot still marked by the      stake), dig the post hole in the usual manner. Obviously,      the deeper the hole, the more rigid the post, so dig as      deep as practicality will allow.    </p>    <p>      Pour a couple of inches of concrete into the hole first, to      act as a support pad for the post. Then set the post,      positioning and plumbing it as you add enough concrete to      steady it in the hole. Be sure to tamp the concrete mix as      you pour, in order to prevent voids or weak spots. Continue      pouring the concrete mix until it fills the narrow post      hole and spreads out into the shallow form hole to a depth      roughly 1 or 2 inches below ground level.    </p>    <p>      The mix in the form hole should look like a big donut      around the base of the post. For added strength, you may      wish to float a few short pieces of steel reinforcing rod      (rebar) down into the mix. More importantly, trowel a small      amount of slope, or "fall," into the surface of the donut,      so that it will shed water away from the post. After      curing, the concrete may be covered with sod/pebbles, etc.,      for a cleaner appearance.    </p>    <p>      This donut pad, gripping in the soil at 90 degree angles to      the post, will hold the ground much more effectively than      the usual "sleeve" of concrete, and the post will be      extraordinarily rigid. I used this technique to anchor a      single 6x6 post on which I mounted a 16-foot tubular metal      gate, and no loosening or leaning has occurred in years.      Try it.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Mike Mitchell<br />      Danville, VA</em>    </p>        <p>      Flower Bed Protector    </p>    <p>      A way to protect any flower patch from garden hose or      electric cord is to use parts of discarded lawn chair      tubing. Cut with a hacksaw or a pipe cutter about 6 inches      from the 90 degree bend and 12 inches the other way. Push      the longest end into the ground at the edge of the flower      patch to about 4 inches above the surface where you want to      protect your flowers. When not in use , it can be left      there for next time, but turned into the flowers so it is      out of the way of the lawn mower or feet.    </p>    <p>      <em>-D. E. Andrews<br />      Riding Mountain, Manitoba</em>    </p>        <p>      Maggie's Dishwasher Trout    </p>    <p>      My sister Maggie has never been one to do things the usual      way. I admit 1 was skeptical when she told me about her      unique method for cooking trout, but I had to try it. It      worked so well I told all my neighbors. Now my neighbor      Marydel Portner won't have her trout any other way.    </p>    <p>      The first thing you do is catch some trout. Then clean them      and prepare them to be eaten. Put a little butter and lemon      on them, wrap them in foil and place them on the top rack      of your dishwasher. Turn it on for a full cycle. (No soap      in there though.) The heat from the water cooks them      perfectly. They'll emerge from the dishwasher tender and      ready to be served.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Charles Miller</em> <em><br /></em> <em>Wellington,      CO</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Golden Eggs</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>To check and see<br />      if an egg is old,<br />      Place in water<br />      That's very cold.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If on its side<br />      It comes to rest,<br />      Then you can bet<br />      It's very fresh.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>When three or four days<br />      Have gone bye<br />      You'll see a tilt,<br />      A rake, a rise.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>An upright egg<br />      is ten days old,<br />      For baking it<br />      Is solid gold.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A floating egg-<br />      Handle With Care!<br />      You don't want it<br />      Exposed to air!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Knight C. Duerig<br /></em> <em>King Hill, ID</em>    </p>        <p>      We'll Bet You Never Thought Glue Can...    </p>    <p>      <em>Remove a splinter.</em> Coat the splinter with a drop      of glue, wait for it to dry, then peel off the dried glue.      The splinter should be stuck to it.    </p>    <p>      <em>Seal plants.</em> Gardeners can use glue to seal the      ends of pruned stems and branches against insects and      excessive moisture loss.    </p>    <p>      <em>Prevent broken shoelaces from fraying.</em> Dip the      ends.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fix small hole in walls.</em> Small nail holes can be      filled by squirting in a drop before painting.    </p>    <p>      <em>Make moldable dough that dries without baking.</em> Mix      equal parts glue, flour and cornstarch. Mix and knead well      until blended. If too dry, add more glue. If too moist, add      more flour and cornstarch. Food coloring may be added if      desired. Dough can be molded into any desired shape to      create animals, figurines, ornaments, and jewelry. Dough      keeps for weeks in a zipped storage bag.    </p>    <p>      <em>Tighten a screw hole.</em> When a screw hole is too      worn out to hold a screw, soak a cotton ball in glue, stuff      it into the hole, and let dry for 24 hours. You can now put      a new screw into the spot.    </p>    <p>      <em>Make a starch fabric stiffener.</em> Mix water and glue      in a bowl to desired consistency. Fabric dipped in the      mixture can be shaped and dried in decorative forms and      shapes.    </p>    <p>      <em>Teach kids how to write their name.</em> Use crayon to      write the child's name on a piece of paper, then trace over      the letters using glue. When the glue dries, children can      use their fingers to trace along the tactile letters of      their names, making it easier to understand the shapes of      the letters.    </p>        <p>      Salt Can...    </p>    <p>      <em>Soften a new pair</em> of <em>jeans.</em> Add one-half      cup to detergent in the washing machine.    </p>    <p>      <em>Repel fleas.</em> Since salt repels fleas, wash      doghouses with salt water to prevent fleas.<br />      <br />      <em>Remove rust from household tools.</em> Make a paste      using two tablespoons salt and one tablespoon lemon juice.      Apply the paste to rust with a dry cloth and rub.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dissolve the soap suds in the sink.</em> Sprinkle on      soap bubbles to make them pop.    </p>    <p>      <em>Clean coffee and tea stains from china cups.</em> Mix      equal amounts salt and white vinegar.    </p>    <p>      <em>Stop pipes from freezing or thaw frozen pipes.</em>      Sprinkle salt down waste pipes in cold weather.    </p>    <p>      <em>Clean dust off silk flowers.</em> Put the flowers in a      large paper bag, pour in two cups, close the bag, and      shake. Salt knocks the dust off the flowers. Remove the      flowers from the bag and shake off the excess salt.    </p>    <p>      <em>Remove dandruff.</em> Shake one tablespoon into dry      hair. Massage gently and shampoo.    </p>    <p>      <em>Prevent grass from growing in crevices.</em> Sprinkle      in the cracks. Salt is a corrosive that kills plants.    </p>    <p>      <em>Absorb spilled cooking grease or a broken egg.</em>      Pour immediately on the spill, let sit for 20 minutes, then      wipe.    </p>    <p>      <em>Prevent colors from fading in the wash.</em> Add one      cup coarse salt to detergent in the washing machine.    </p>    <p>      <em>Keep slugs away.</em> Sprinkle on the sidewalk close to      the grass. When slugs try to approach your house, the salt      will kill them by reverse osmosis. This works well in      keeping slugs away from pet food, too.    </p>        <p>      Geritol Can...    </p>    <p>      <em>Revive an ailing houseplant.</em> Give the plant two      tablespoons Geritol twice a week for three months. New      leaves should begin to grow within the first month.    </p>    <p>      <em>Polish shoes.</em> In a pinch, you can shine your brown      leather shoes with a few drops on a soft cloth.    </p>    <p>      <em>Remove stains, rings, and minor scratches from wood      furniture. Apply</em> to the wood with a cotton ball, wipe      away excess, and polish as usual.    </p>        <p>      Cat Litter Can...    </p>    <p>      <em>Create emergency traction for automobiles.</em> Keep a      bag in your car trunk in case you get stuck in the ice or      snow. When poured under the tire, it provides excellent      traction.    </p>    <p>      <em>Soak up car oil and transmission fluid.</em> Litter      works as an absorbent to pick up transmission leaks from      garage floors. Pour a thick layer of unused litter over the      puddle, wait 24 hours, and sweep up with a broom. Scrub      clean with a solution of detergent and hot water.    </p>    <p>      <em>Deodorize a garbage can.</em> Cover bottom of garbage      can with I inch of litter to absorb grease and moisture.    </p>    <p>      <em>Prevent mildew in bathtub.</em> Pour litter in a flat      box and place in your bathtub to prevent mildew when you      leave your house for a long time. (Keep the bathroom door      closed if you have cats so they don't use it.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Deodorize a stale refrigerator.</em> Pour litter in a      flat box, place it on the middle shelf, and shut the door      for four or five days.    </p>    <p>      <em>Provide traction on snow-covered driveways and      sidewalks.</em> Sprinkle on the snow-covered walk.    </p>    <p>      <em>Prevent musty, damp odors in a closed summer      house.</em> Fill shallow boxes with litter. To soak up      musty, lingering odors, place one in each room before      closing up the house.    </p>    <p>      <em>Deodorize sneakers. Fill</em> the feet of a pair of      knee-high hose with litter, tie the ends and place inside      sneakers overnight.    </p>    <p>      <em>Prevent grease fires in barbecue grills.</em> Cover      bottom of grill with a 3/4-inch layer of litter to reduce      fires.    </p>
