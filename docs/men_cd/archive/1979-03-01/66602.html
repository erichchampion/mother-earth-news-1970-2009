                    <p>      <em>Pecan trees in Canada? A far-north, native species      makes it possible!</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by       R. DOUGLAS CAMPBELL AND JOHN H. GORDON, JR.    </h5>        <p>      <em>Northerners can go "nuts" over pecans, too!</em>    </p>    <p>      Does the thought of roasted pecans and pecan pies make your      mouth water? Well, here's some good news for residents of      the northern United States and southern Canada: You may      soon be able to grow these valuable nuts right in your own      back yard!    </p>    <p>      Although the pecan is usually thought of as a resident of      the Deep South, a few native stands of these noteworthy nut      producers are known to exist along the Missouri River in      north central Missouri and the Mississippi River near      Dubuque, Iowa. Early settlers even reported finding pecans      on the Ohio River as far north as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.      But, unfortunately, most of these northern strains have      long since fallen to "civilization". You can imagine the      excitement, then, when naturalists discovered a few      scattered native trees as tar north as southern Wisconsin!    </p>    <h3>      INDIAN ORCHARDS    </h3>    <p>      Pecan trees (which can live for 500 years) originated in      northern Texas and southern Oklahoma, and were spread along      the canoe-trails of the American Indians. (The word "pecan"      comes from the Indian word <em>paccan</em> : "food which      has to be cracked out of a hard shell".) These      nuts-once a staple of the Indian diet-were easy to      collect and highly nutritious, stored well, and were good      for barter.    </p>    <p>      It's believed that the native Americans planted pecans in      the vicinity of regularly used campsites to provide      "grubstakes" for their descendants. And-since the      Indians preferred to plant the biggest and thinnest-shelled      species-this "cultivation" not only increased the      growing range of the beautiful shade tree but greatly      improved the quality of its nuts as well!    </p>    <p>      But no one realized just <em>how</em> widely the tree had      actually been spread until recently, when some fine      examples of the "northern" pecan were found hidden away in      the rugged forests of southern Wisconsin and in the      northernmost regions of Iowa and Illinois. These old trees,      which grow as far as 300 miles north of the currently      available northern pecans, make it feasible to adapt the      nut tree to much colder climates than modem growers had      previously thought possible!    </p>    <h3>      A RARE SEED OFFER    </h3>    <p>      Members of the Northern Nut Growers Association      (NNGA)-a non-profit group dedicated to the promotion      of nut growing in the north-have already made      exploratory expeditions into this extreme northern range of      the pecan. And, as a result of their efforts, a      "distribution program" of this rare species is being      sponsored-as a public service-by the NNGA.    </p>    <p>      You see, it was discovered that the few remaining trees are      located in fertile bottomland immediately adjacent to      rivers . . . areas that are coveted for the production of      corn. And sadly enough, there is strong pressure to destroy      these remarkable old stands. So, not only does      participation in this program offer northern residents the      opportunity to grow some super-tasty nuts ... it may also      be the last chance to save and regenerate this hardiest of      northern pecans.    </p>    <p>      To obtain a packet of eight of the rare seeds, send a $3.00      check (made payable to "NNGA Pecan Seed Program") to the      Northern Nut Growers Association, Inc., Attention: John H.      Gordon, Jr., 1385 Campbell Boulevard, North Tonawanda, New      York 14120. (Or, for $8.00, you can join the NNGA. Members      may buy the seed packet for $2.00 . . . and they get a      quarterly newsletter as well and an annual report      chock-full of information on growing northern nut species.)      However, your order must be received by <em>March 20,      1979</em> in order to be processed in time for the '79      growing season. That's just days away . . . <em>so you're      going to have to act NOW!</em>    </p>    <p>      In return for providing the seeds, the NNGA will request      participants in their program to fill out occasional      questionnaires about the performance of the trees over the      next 5 to 20 years.<br />      Complete growing instructions will be sent with each seed      packet, but it should be remembered that seed-grown trees      produce seedlings with a wide range of characteristics. In      previous tests, though, the germination performance has      averaged 60%, and many of the parent trees have survived      winter temperatures as low as - 35Â° F and have ripened      well-filled nuts in seasons as short as 130 frost-free      days.    </p>    <p>      And-although the nuts of these trees are somewhat      smaller than the "paper-shelled" pecans produced by their      southern cousins-northern pecan kernels are some of      the sweetest known to exist!    </p>
