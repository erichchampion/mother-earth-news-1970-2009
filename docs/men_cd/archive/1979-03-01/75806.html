All rights        reserved.</em>			</p>	        <p>      Fruit trees in the orchard or anywhere about the home may      be made to bear a much larger crop of fruit, and much finer      specimens, if the trees are properly treated with      fertilizers and given the attention they need to produce a      healthy and vigorous growth.    </p>    <p>      May is the best time to apply the fertilizer, and it makes      no difference how old the tree is, the application should      be given, and the results will be plainly seen. Those who      have made a careful study of this method of invigorating      fruit trees declare there is a great difference seen when      certain trees or rows of trees are not treated and stand in      the same orchard on similar land to that on which the other      trees stand. It is not a costly experiment, and will bring      the fruit grower immense returns. One application will do      good but it is best to keep it up each year for a period of      at least three years, before a year is allowed to pass      without fertilization, and then it should not be      discontinued for more than a year at a time.    </p>    <p>      Trees large enough to bear should be given the following:      five pounds of nitrate of soda, five pounds of acid      phosphate, and two and a half pounds of muriate of potash,      making twelve and one half pounds of the mixture to the      tree.    </p>    <p>      A less quantity of the same mixture may be given a tree not      old enough to bear fruit, judgment being used in the amount      according to the size and vigor of the tree.    </p>    <p>      In applying this fertilizer the party should walk round the      tree taking care to keep three or four feet farther from      the trunk than the ends of the longest branches as they      spread out over the soil.    </p>    <p>      Sow the mixture, throwing it in toward the tree, but      allowing the most of the fertilizer to fall nearest the      point where you pass round the outer circle. It is not      essential that any fall on the ground nearer than three or      four feet from the body of the tree.    </p>    <p>      The smaller roots will collect the strength and carry it to      every portion of the tree. It is well to sprinkle the      fertilizer on the surface just previous to a shower. The      rain will dissolve it and it will immediately go into the      earth.    </p>    <p>      If the trees have been mulched it is not necessary to      remove this to apply the mixture, but simply scatter on top      of the litter and the rains will soon carry its strength to      the soil beneath the mulching material. -J. T. T.,      Ohio.    </p>        <h3>      PLANTING FRUIT TREES    </h3>    <p>      As soon as trees arrive they should be unpacked and if they      show any signs of being shriveled, should be "heeled" in      moist dirt for several days before setting. When roots and      bodies look plump and healthy, a little moist hay or grass      thrown over them until time for setting will keep them in      good condition.    </p>    <p>      Cut off all broken or bruised roots before putting the tree      into the ground. Prune the tops until the limbs present a      symmetrical head. Cut the limbs away about one-half and      leave the last bud on the outside as this will form a      better head.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to set the tree in line with the others and as      nearly perpendicular as possible. The roots should have      plenty of room. They should not be twisted together or      wound in a circle. Make the hole plenty large enough to      accommodate the roots without cramping or the tree will be      seriously handicapped.    </p>    <p>      Tamp the soil thoroughly about the roots. When the hole      lacks an inch or two of being filled, pour in a couple of      buckets of water. This will settle the soil well around the      roots and furnish the needed moisture. Cover with loose      dirt and leave a soil mulch a couple of inches deep about      the base of the tree.-W. D. N.    </p>        <p>      Seed-bed preparation is the leading thought in every      farmer's head just now. Some ask an agricultural editor or      some other wise man how they can best fit their stalk      ground for oats or a little later their plowing for corn.      Noman can correctly answer that question without knowing      the field, its past treatment, and the season. Then      sometimes it is hard to tell. About all the seed-bed advice      that can be given is the kind of a seed-bed to be kept in      mind as the ideal. It is then left to the individual to      work out for himself the best method of bringing his field      as nearly as possible to that standard. There is a world of      difference in the way a field works up in different      seasons. This is especially true of the field in which the      humus matter is low. The field that contains plenty of      humus can be put into good seed-bed condition almost any      time.    </p>    <p>      Cross fences all through the fields are an abomination.      Some permanent fences we must have, and we want them      permanent too, but there are too many field fences wasting      good ground. Father was visiting in Michigan last year and      he tells of farms there fenced off in five to ten acre      fields with rail fences. What a waste of land and a growth      of weeds those must incur. Even a wire fence through the      field is almost a snug harbor for weeds and insects. I like      the plan of having the work land in one big field and then,      as the harvesting and pasturing of the crops require, put      up temporary fences. I believe the time saved in      cultivating and plowing will care for the building of such      fences.    </p>    <p>      "Here is my pastime," said a husky young farmer as he      handed me a package of flower seeds to examine. I noticed      sweet peas, pansies and a list of the other old favorites.      "I plant these in the garden" he said "in rows like the      vegetables. You can't keep flower beds clean unless you put      your whole time in on them. I want the most flowers      possible for the time expended, so take this way." To me      that man is both a practical man and a poet. He loves the      beautiful and goes about to get it. His neighbors tell me      that he grows the good things of life into his character in      the same way.    </p>        <h3>      RECIPES    </h3>    <p>      <em>Chicken Loaf</em> -Boil three chickens until      tender. Remove the bones and put the meat through a      chopper, together with three stalks of celery and a small      onion. Season with pepper and salt. Pack in a deep dish and      pour over it the liquor in which the chicken was cooked.      Let it stand in a cool place for several hours and then it      is ready for use. This is very nice for the children's      school dinner, sliced thin and laid between slices of bread      and butter.    </p>    <p>      <em>Rice and Potato Soup</em> -Peel three large      potatoes and chop them fine, add one-half cup of well      washed rice, and boil until soft in two quarts of salted      water. Season to taste, add a piece of butter (nut butter      gives a fine flavor, and it should be rubbed to a cream      with a few drops of water before adding to the soup),      thicken with a small teaspoon of flour and just before      taking from the fire, add a cup of sweet cream.    </p>    <p>      <em>Eggs in Baked Potatoes</em> -6 potatoes, 6 eggs,      5 tbsp. grated cheese, 6 tbsp. butter, 1/2 tsp. salt. Bake      potatoes; when soft cut off the tops, remove half the      insides, drop in one raw egg, sprinkle with salt, pepper,      butter and cheese. Put back in the oven for five      minutes.<br />      An earthen dish of quicklime placed in closets will absorb      moisture and act as a disinfectant. It is also said to keep      away rats and mice.    </p>    <h3>      SALAD DRESSING    </h3>    <p>      Delicious dressing for spinach, or any kind of greens is      made as follows: One cup vinegar, put on fire and while it      is heating, mix one teaspoon each of salt, sugar, powdered      mustard, and pepper; the two latter should be used      according to their strength, generally the mustard should      be used very heaping and the pepper very scant, even full.      Stir these together dry, and add the yolks of three eggs,      and after the paste is very smooth beat in one cup of thick      sour cream. When vinegar boils put in the above mixture,      and let come to a boil. Have ready the whites of the eggs      beaten stiff and whisk them in the hot dressing, remove      from fire, and put in a jar. This dressing will keep      indefinitely. If too thick it may be thinned with a little      milk or cream when used. This quantity will dress several      salads, the number depends upon the size of the salad or      mess of "greens."    </p>        <p>      Education will broaden a narrow mind, but there's no known      cure for a big head. The best you can hope is that it will      swell up and bust; and then, of course, there's nothing      left.-G. H. Lorimer.    </p>    <p>      Binding a cloth, dampened with cold water, to the back of      the head, is a means of stopping bleeding at the nose, the      head being held up well to aid in the checking.    </p>
