                    		<hr />        <p>      <em>In MOTHER NO. 55, we told you about alcohol and its      potential as a fuel (see the Plowboy Interview, pages 16-24      and "The Alcohol-Gasohol Fuel Solution", pages 84-85).      Well, we sure haven't lost our enthusiasm for this      excellent renewable resource (take a look at our ethanol      follow-up article beginning on page 114), but we're also      excited about another source of      energy-hydrogen-which many folks feel is the      fuel of the future.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Recently, MOTHER sent a staffer and a photographer out      to Provo, Utah to talk to Roger Billings, head of the      Billings Energy Corporation. Between manufacturing computer      systems and doing hydrogen research, Mr. Billings is quite      a busy gentleman ... nevertheless, he took the time to      discuss the various aspects of hydrogen with us, including      its production and use as a fuel. The points he brought up      were interesting enough, but the equipment he demonstrated      was even more impressive ... since it provided us with      proof that hydrogen power isn't just yesterday's dream, but      today's reality!</em>    </p>    <p>      Petroleum-though far from an ideal source of      fuel-is essentially the energy that our society runs      on. But, with the planet's supply of "black gold"      dwindling, alternative sources of energy must be developed      ... and one of the most likely candidates for a substitute      fuel is hydrogen.    </p>    <p>      Although this light gas is one of the most abundant      elements on earth (plentiful in water <em>and</em> in both      fossil and nonfossil matter), it's rarely found in a      natural free state. Therefore, the fuel must be isolated      (which until recently involved a costly manufacturing      process), and the very economics of that      separation-plus the storage problems that hydrogen      presents-made the gas impractical as a fuel in the      past.    </p>    <p>      In the last decade, however, there have been many advances      in the hydrogen field, and-thanks to researchers like      Mr. Billings-this fuel is very near to becoming a      practical energy source.    </p>    <h3>      WHY HYDROGEN?    </h3>    <p>      Obviously, hydrogen isn't the <em>only</em> solution to our      "power" problems . . . but it does happen to be one of the      better ones. Since the gas is present in almost all matter,      our supply is virtually inexhaustible. In addition,      hydrogen is lightweight, non-toxic, and highly efficient as      a fuel (it has a high heat value of about 62,400 Btu's per      pound ... as opposed to petroleum oil with 19,000, and      natural gas with 22,500) and it can be substituted for most      fuels being used today. Even better, this plentiful energy      source is entirely <em>nonpolluting</em> (the only      by-product produced by burning hydrogen is water vapor, if      the combustion temperatures are controlled) and leaves no      residue.    </p>    <h3>      COSTS ARE COMPETITIVE    </h3>    <p>      here are two ways of manufacturing hydrogen: One is      electrolysis, in which water is separated by an electric      current into its two basic elements (hydrogen and oxygen),      and the second is a process called reforming, which uses      high-temperature steam to liberate the hydrogen from coal,      natural gas, or solid wastes.    </p>    <p>      On a small scale, the electrolysis method is more      cost-effective ... especially since the Billings      corporation has been perfecting a homestead package that      will allow individuals to virtually "make their own". But      in production quantities (unless inexpensive hydroelectric      power is available) the reforming process is far cheaper      ... so much so, in fact, that the cost of one "gallon" of      hydrogen (2.25 pounds of hydrogen supply the energy      equivalent of one gallon of gasoline) is about 25 cents!    </p>    <p>      Hydrogen is also economical for heating purposes. Whereas      natural gas figures out to a cost of about $2.44 per      million Btu's, hydrogen comes to only $2.00 for every      million Btu's worth of energy . . . and that's at today's      prices. If hydrogen production were carried out on a      large-scale basis, the costs could be reduced by as much as      30% . . . even if conventional energy sources were used to      "free" the gas.    </p>    <p>      And that brings up another point: Hydrogen can be produced      by a number of means that don't depend on conventional      fossil fuels. Solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal,      tidal, and ocean-thermal energy are currently being      investigated as power sources, and solar energy is actually      being used to release the gas from a storage state in the      Billings operation.    </p>    <h3>      HOW IT WORKS    </h3>    <p>      Since full-scale hydrogen production is still a few years      off (although the Billings firm is now working on      coal-to-gas conversion plants), it would be better to look      at the small-scale electrolysis package that Billings      presently markets. This $15,000 kit consists of [1] the      electrolyzer, which produces hydrogen gas by "filtering"      water with a special membrane that allows the hydrogen to      pass through the material . . . leaving the oxygen behind,      and [2] the hydride-filled hydrogen storage tank .. . which      can hold the gas-safely-for an indefinite      period of time.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, hydrogen storage has been expensive,      somewhat dangerous, and inefficient. But the Billings      research labs have perfected the use of an iron/titanium      hydride which-when granulated and placed in a      pressure tank-soaks up hydrogen like a sponge. This      "chemical container" not only allows the vessel to hold up      to four times as much of the gas (under the same pressure)      as it would without the hydrides, but also assures that the      fuel can be stored safely. In fact, during recent tests,      armor-piercing incendiary bullets were shot through the      gas-filled containers with nothing more than a small flame      (which quickly extinguished itself) as a result.    </p>    <p>      The gas within the storage tank can be released by heat:      either from the sun or from the hydrogen itself as it      combusts, depending on the application ... and there are      quite a few possible uses, including home heating, cooking,      engine fuel, and even electric power generation. Roger      Billings admits that the potential is nearly endless and      feels safe in saying, "Any energy application that requires      the burning of hydrocarbon fuels can be converted to      hydrogen ... at least I haven't seen one yet that      couldn't." And Roger should know, since not only is he      running the family car and a small garden tractor on the      gas, but he's set up a homestead that's <em>entirely      hydrogen powered</em> , just to show that it does indeed      work.    </p>    <h3>      HYDROGEN'S FUTURE    </h3>    <p>      Enough technology exists right now to allow us to become a      hydrogen-powered society . . . provided that we had ample      reserves of the gas. But-while plans are being made      to produce the gas in quantity -the Billings Energy      Corporation is just as busy converting existing equipment      to use hydrogen ... and this adaptation can be as simple as      installing a steel wool catalyst (covered with a stainless      steel screen) on the burner of a stove. The automotive      conversions are a bit more complicated, but again, Billings      has the problems licked . . . and, in fact, is presently      marketing a dual-fuel Dodge Omni (hydrogen-or      gasoline-powered)-complete with the      hydrogen-producing package-for about $30,000 ... a      price which, although high, will be substantially reduced      as more units are sold.    </p>    <p>      Looking to the future, the Billings Energy Corporation has      drawn up a 10-year plan that's now on its way to becoming a      reality. The initial goal is to have the 4,000-person      community of Forest City, Iowa fully converted to hydrogen      power (including autos, buses, and municipal vehicles)      within the next five years. If that project goes as planned      (and there's no reason it shouldn't), Billings next aims to      convert a city the approximate size of Denver, Colorado to      hydrogen fuel. The Billings firm has already taken part in      an experimental program that tested hydrogen-powered buses      in the cities of Provo and Riverside, Utah ... with      encouraging results.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, we're only beginning to take advantage of      the potential of hydrogen fuels ... but in a few      years-or perhaps even sooner-we might all [1]      reduce our dependence on imported oil, [2] eliminate our      surplus of solid waste, and [3] be breathing cleaner air      ... all in one fell swoop!    </p>
