                <p>      <strong>REFORT FROM THEM THATS DOIN'</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      ----by JANET      RYAN----    </h5>        <p>      When we moved to Tucson, Arizona from a big city in the      Northeast, we were delighted to find an apartment with a      patio . . . even though that plot was just a narrow      rectangle of barren adobe clay! We weren't discouraged,      either, by the fact that the area had little rainfall, or      that the temperatures ranged between 100° and 110°      from June until October. After six years of a single plant      on a city windowsill and "Keep Off" signs on every      available patch of grass, we saw-in this arid little      plot of dirt-a great potential for vegetables,      flowers, and relaxation . . . and we were right!    </p>    <h3>      DOING MORE WITH LESS    </h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, our new patio was small (15 by 29 feet), and      nearly a quarter of its total area was paved with concrete.      The usable space was reduced further, too, because we had      to leave an access path to the electric meter at the plot's      far end.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the space problems, we discovered      that-since the "yard" was flanked on three sides by a      high wooden fence and by an apartment building on the      fourth-our prospective garden would receive only a      few hours of sun a day. (And that desert sun seemed more      likely to burn delicate seedlings than to nourish them!)    </p>    <p>      But we were undeterred, and-although neither Jack nor      I was familiar with organic gardening methods-we knew      we didn't want to use any of the chemicals and pesticides      that had been a part of our previous gardens. So, with      wholistically grown flowers and vegetables in mind, we set      to work under an already hot February sky.    </p>    <p>      The "native flora" on our tiny patio's parched soil      consisted of a few especially stubborn weeds, which I      pulled up and stuffed into the open spaces under the fence      to form a crude retaining wall (I hoped this "dike" would      help keep desperately needed water in the garden where it      "belonged"). Once that was done, my husband and I outlined      a path to the meter with discarded bricks, and-using      a borrowed shovel-dug up the rest of the adobe to a      depth of eight or ten inches ... a truly backbreaking and      blistering job.    </p>    <p>      To our surprise, we found the soil was rich . . . but it      packed down quickly. In order to keep our sunbaked earth      loose, we mixed in 10 cubic feet of redwood mulch and four      cubic feet of peat moss. And-where the patio sloped      up to the far-back corner-Jack and I built terraces      with small clay walls to help hold the precious,      life-giving water.    </p>    <h3>      FROM PLAN TO PLANTS    </h3>    <p>      Everything was ready for planting by the first week in      March, and-after some careful consideration-we      chose the space between the path and the house (an area      that received direct sunlight from 10:00 a.m. till noon) to      grow six Big Boy hybrid tomato seedlings. Then, we bordered      those crossbreeds with a few mint sprigs and some purple      and blue violets ... to remind us of New England springs.    </p>    <p>      The very back corner of the patio was sunny from noon until      3:00 p.m., so that became our "cornfield" (two seeds to a      hill ... 15 inches apart, and three rows deep). Four mounds      of yellow squash, two rows of beets, and a patch of lettuce      and parsley rounded out our vegetable section. Near the end      of the yard, we established a little plot of pansies and      marigolds . . .surrounded with water-saving dikes. White      clover provided ground cover over the remaining barren      spots, and would serve to replenish the soil's nitrogen at      the same time.    </p>    <h3>      WASTE NOT, WANT NOT    </h3>    <p>      Our Arizona yard didn't have room for a compost pile,      but-as the plants grew-we mulched them with      clippings from the apartment lawns, plus vegetable and      fruit peels, coffee grounds, tea leaves, and so forth from      our kitchen. This waste soon crumbled in the desert sun and      was mixed into the dirt . . . causing no odor or pest      problems in the process.    </p>    <p>      We also poured our dish- and wash-water into the garden to      help reduce the amount of irrigation necessary.      And-though Jack or I still had to soak the soil      thoroughly three times a week-our series of little      dikes and canals reduced the runoff and captured every      possible drop of precious moisture during the rare Tucson      rain showers.    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, insects didn't prove to be a problem for us      at all. We simply washed the occasional aphids off our      plants with soapy dishwater, squashed the inchworms, and      snipped tomato worms in two with shears. Our bug control      program was, however, simplified . . . thanks greatly to a      number of praying mantises and lizards who took up      residence on the patio.    </p>    <h3>      SWEET REWARDS    </h3>    <p>      Although our desert city garden didn't provide Jack and me      with <em>all</em> the vegetables we needed ... we were more      than happy with our results. Tomatoes (we were told) can't      thrive in such heat . . . yet we harvested over 75 juicy,      red fruits. And the parsley and mint were so profuse that      we dried some for winter use! Our corn yielded a couple of      sweet ears per plant in early June (the stalks were then      pulled up and zinnias planted in the reopened space). The      lettuce lasted until late June, when the blistering Arizona      summer heat finally killed it. But our squash mounds      produced abundantly throughout the hot weather, and we were      still eating from our beets well into the winter.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the fresh vegetables, our patio also      provided us with many lovely flowers. The violets bloomed      early in the spring . . . the pansies from March to late      June . . . and the marigolds and zinnias from early June      until late fall. By the time the pansies had finished      flowering, seeds (sunflower, millet, kafir, corn, etc.)      that our feathered friends had scattered from the bird      feeder were already up and growing. As these matured, we      were able to enjoy the antics of various finches as they      fed from the tops of swaying stalks.    </p>    <p>      When the plants died or finished bearing, we pulled them up      and returned them to the soil. And-during the      following winter-we continued to add organic matter      from the kitchen, plus a little dried manure. Then, the      following spring, we dug more peat moss into the soil . . .      and discovered that a minor miracle had occurred!    </p>    <p>      You see, when we began our garden not a single earthworm      could be found in the dry, bricklike ground, but-just      12 months later-every shovelful of soil was rich with      the squirming, helpful, little creatures . . . and, thanks      to these natural composters, our second garden was even      more lush and productive than the first had been!    </p>    <p>      As a result of our success, Jack and I (who, as I've said,      are both former pesticide-and-chemical-fertilizer      gardeners) have become zealous converts to-      <em>and</em> advocates of-organic gardening methods.      After all, we proved for <em>ourselves</em> that it isn't      impossible (or even especially difficult!) to grow food and      flowers right smack in the middle of the Sonoran desert! Of      course, our methods are still crude, but we're having a      ball while we learn . . . and in the meantime, our      household is eating" better than ever!    </p>
