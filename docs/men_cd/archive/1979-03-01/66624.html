                    <h5 id="byline">      by MARC BRISTOL:    </h5>        <p>      <em>Marc Bristol and other Washington State grassroots      musicians wail away on a gutbucket, washboard, and jug (the      axe is a gag). For Marc's original homegrown music      column-which featured gutbucket, washboard, jug,      kazoo, musical saw, and spoons "makin' and playin'      "instructions-see MOTHER NO. 50. Inset shows      gutbucket "notch and bevel "details</em> .    </p>    <p>      Even homesteaders need to relax and enjoy themselves from      time to time, right? And almost everybody these days wants      to cut his or her cost of living. So how about a little      do-it-yourself entertainment?    </p>    <p>      And that's what this column is all about. Down-home music      that you can make . . . and the instruments (which, in some      cases, you can also make!) to play that music on.    </p>    <p>      We may also publish some songs, discuss music as a      potential home business, run discographies, bibliographies,      and/or include whatever other do-it-yourself music topics      you'd like to see.    </p>    <p>      The important thing is that this is a new column. If you      like it, write to me and let me know. If you have some      ideas for this feature, let me know that. I'm open to any      suggestions or information you care to contribute. I'll      even try to answer your questions about down-home music . .      . but-both for the benefit of all MOTHER's readers      and to ease my correspondence load-I'll deal with      those questions, whenever possible, here in this column . .      . rather than in personal letters.    </p>    <p>      Address your correspondence-for this column and this      column only-to Marc Bristol, 31722 N.E. 180th Place,      Duvall, Wash. 98019.    </p>    <p>      Since most anybody can use a few extra bucks every now and      then, I'm going to plunge right in and tell you how you      might be able to turn your music hobby into an occasional      job ... to finance a pair of new strings, pay for a trip      into town, or even cover the rent check once in a while.    </p>    <p>      However, before you attempt to parlay your pickin' into      cold hard cash, It's best to be sure that you've reached      the point in your study of music where you feel like      sharing it with folks other than close friends and      relatives. (Trying to play professionally <em>before</em>      your ability is up to the task can be a mighty      disheartening experience!) And, once you have enough      proficiency at your chosen instrument to perform "in      public", you still need to find an audience that's willing      to pay to be entertained.    </p>    <p>      And that's where this issue's column comes in. I've been      earning a share of my income by pickin' and singin' for      several years, so I can make some suggestions that might      just help you find a few of those groups of paying      listeners.    </p>    <p>      I'd like to point out right from the start, though, that      I'm not promoting the notion that you can become      self-sufficient by playing music. In most cases (the      exceptions being mainly tiresome gigs in nightclubs or bars      that <em>will</em> support you for a year or so) the only      way to actually earn a living from music is to spend a lot      of time on the road.    </p>    <p>      Now, this sort of work could provide an acceptable      lifestyle for nomadic individuals who don't mind living in      a truck or school bus, but the constant wandering that it      requires would be pretty much out of the question for      homebodies who prefer to spend time around the home or      farmstead. On the other hand, If you already keep your      expenses to a minimum-either by growing your own food      or owning your home-an occasional "extra" source of      income may be all that you need. Either way-whether      you hope to become a full-time "pro" or just aim to feed      the cookie jar every once in a while-you'll probably      have to start at the bottom.    </p>    <h3>      GIVE YOURSELF A JOB!    </h3>    <p>      And that starting point, in terms of playin' for pay, is      the kind of gig that you don't have to audition for,      because you hire <em>yourself</em> . I'm talking, of      course, about singin' on the street! There's usually not a      whole lot of money in this sort of work. In fact, $20 a day      for three or four very strenuous sets Is about the best you      should expect . . . unless your act is extremely novel and      you happen to be playing during the Christmas season.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that (for some strange reason) It's illegal      in many areas to just set yourself up on a corner and play.      So- unless you've seen other "street acts" on your      intended spot-It's best to check with the police      department before you start to perform. Also, many places      (Seattle's Pike Place Market and the entire city of San      Francisco, for example) require a somewhat expensive      "street singer's" license, and I haven't heard of any new      permits being granted in the latter city at all.    </p>    <p>      What you'll be doing, should you decide to try one of these      "do it yourself" jobs, is singing and playing your heart      out-with your hat, guitar case, or whatever opened      invitingly-in the hopes that people will brighten up      and salt that container with a little spare change (or even      an apple or an orange!).    </p>    <p>      And don't feel that your unsolicited performance      constitutes begging! The world can always use another song,      and music on the streets adds a little culture to the      otherwise bland and sterile urban environment.    </p>    <h3>      SING FOR YOUR SUPPER    </h3>    <p>      For a variation on the above theme, you could try to "sign      up" with a small restaurant, sandwich shop, salad kitchen,      or some such ... in exchange for a salary or even just tips      and lunch. If you see a likely place that doesn't have a      resident minstrel, approach the management with your idea.      It would probably be best to begin by offering your      services for lunch <em>and</em> a small fee. Then, if the      store owner won't agree to that plan, he or she may at      least be willing to guarantee a certain figure (again, $10      to $20 is probably as much as you can expect), and promise      to make up the difference if your tips don't equal that      amount.    </p>    <h3>      OR, "BAND"TOGETHER!    </h3>    <p>      Better yet, if you get real tight with a bunch of your      homegrown musical friends (and I <em>don't</em> mean after      passing the bottle of homebrew around a few times), you      might consider looking for work at a local craft carnival      or other similar affair. My group has just finished an      extended period of playing these festivals, and we closed      off the "season" with our annual performance at the Western      Washington State Fair. This year, our pay ranged from $7.00      (in tips) and three T-shirts, to $250 for two 45-minute      sets.    </p>    <p>      In order to tackle this type of performance, you should      have a good, solid repertoire of at least 20 or 30 songs.      The average set, you see, will contain between 10 and 15      numbers (unless you get into long jams with several      extended solo breaks). Most craft or county fairs are good      for one or two shows, and they usually have enough money to      pay you pretty well for your services.    </p>    <p>      Watch out, though, for the old "we don't have much money      left in our budget but the exposure will do you good"      routine. That kind of arrangement can only go on for so      long before you realize that you're providing a valuable      service to the fair's management and receiving nothing (or      next to it) in return. Furthermore, if your only goal is to      get up and entertain people, there are plenty of more      pleasant ways to do it ... If you simply spread the word      around.    </p>    <p>      You (or your band) could also just go ahead and promote      your <em>own</em> concert or dance. This idea should work      especially well in a rural area, where there often isn't      much entertainment available and where grange halls and so      forth can usually be rented at reasonable rates. If you      "start from scratch" in this way, however, you'll have to      plan to advertise. The best (and least expensive) way to do      this is to find a graphic artist (perhaps there's even one      in your group) and have some simple photocopied posters      made up. Remember, though, that these promotional materials      should be out where folks can see them at least two weeks      before the event, and make sure that the local newspapers      and radio stations know about your hoedown, too. Such      sources will often give you free publicity . . .      <em>if</em> you get the materials to them well in advance      of the performance.    </p>    <p>      Your self-promoted shindig will be a whole lot more likely      to succeed if you can avoid competing with other public      entertainments . . . such as the "big" movies, local high      school dances, and so forth. Foreknowledge of other events      isn't always available, however, so you'll have to be ready      to just break even-or maybe go into the hole-      <em>unless</em> you're able to assure attendance at your      concert or dance by selling advance tickets.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, the local movie theater can sometimes      work <em>for</em> you, too. These businesses are      occasionally willing to run a live music show-perhaps      at no cost to musician (s)-because of the money that      can be made by selling refreshments during the performance.      You see, the theater owner would ordinarily have to pay to      show a film (and he or she may be having trouble with      attendance on week nights), so this sort of symbiotic      arrangement could be to that person's advantage.    </p>    <h3>      THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONCERT    </h3>    <p>      If you feel that your solo act or group really has      something special to offer, why not try for a concert at a      small college? Junior colleges have sprung up everywhere      over the past few years, and most of 'em offer free      entertainment programs (often during lunch hours) to their      students. In order to get one of these jobs, however, you      may have to put together what's known as a "promo package".      This packet would usually contain a photo of you or your      group, a tape recording or record of one of your songs, and      some sort of glowing description of the kind of music you      play. (A poster-which the college could print up and      place around the campus-would also be a big help.)    </p>    <p>      Junior college jobs weren't hard to come by a few years      back. Now, however (at least around my area), you have to      have your promo kit in the mailbox by the end of the school      year in order to get booked for either of the following two      semesters. Of course, the community colleges in your locale      may not be so "sophisticated" yet.    </p>    <p>      My original promo package consisted of a "photocopied      special" poster, including a couple of pictures and the      slogan "Homegrown Mountain Music", as well as a short typed      description of the kind of music I play. After a while I      had a newspaper clipping to add . . . from the local      daily's article about my escapades in a nearby sandwich      shop. Even with this crude "kit", I was able to demand $50      for a one-hour performance, and many folks with better      packages were getting a good deal more.    </p>    <p>      Weddings and private parties also offer income      possibilities to the home-grown musician. All of the      above-mentioned job-finding methods will help you get      invited to play at such occasions, and you might also try      having some business cards printed. These "pocket posters"      won't cost you more than $20 and can be hung in all the      places where you see other cards (the ones that advertise      bulldozing, horseshoeing, and so forth) tacked up, or just      handed out to anyone who expresses an interest in hiring      you or your group.    </p>    <h3>      SHOULD YOU "ELECTRIFY" YOURSELF?    </h3>    <p>      It's unlikely that you'd need your own sound amplifying      equipment for most of the jobs that I've mentioned      (assuming, of course, that you have an acoustic solo act or      group) ... as this paraphernalia either wouldn't be      necessary or would be provided by the sponsoring person or      organization. Of course, a sound system will definitely      expand your performing possibilities, but-unless      you're a good and patient "horse trader" or have the      electrical know-how to build the equipment      yourself-such accessories can involve a considerable      expense.    </p>    <p>      The realm of sound-reinforcement is a whole different ball      game from playing music, and I don't have the space here to      really go into it. Suffice it to say that- should      this equipment become necessary-it's a good idea to      keep some money out of each performance to finance the      microphones, amps, and so forth. Another workable plan      would be to have each member of your group pay for an equal      share of the equipment.    </p>    <p>      You'll notice that I haven't said much about the usual      tavern and bar gigs, and that's because I'm just not much      interested in those kinds of employment myself. I think      that playing for four or five hours in a noisy,      smoke-filled place (that doesn't even serve much that      interests me) is too much like hard work. If you have a      good dance band, though, these places are prime markets for      your musical services.    </p>    <p>      So, if you want to spread the good feelings that you get      from music around- either alone or with your pickin'      partners-check out a few of the scenes that I've      described. The opportunities are there (and more can be      created!). Just believe that the world should have more      music, and you'll begin to see the places where that need      exists.    </p>    <p>      A lot of folks have written in to say that they'd like to      see more homemade instrument instructions. Well, just hang      in there, because I've got a couple of do-it-yourself      articles in the works, and more still that are in the      "idea'' stage.    </p>    <p>      I'd also like to apologize for not getting my promised list      of upcoming music festivals ready in time for this issue.      The information is just about ready, though. I'll try to      pass it on to you in MOTHER NO. 57.    </p>    <p>      And <em>please</em> keep your letters comin'! I've picked      up a world of information from readers who enjoy this      column, and a lot of those tips will be showing up on these      pages in the future. 8    </p>
