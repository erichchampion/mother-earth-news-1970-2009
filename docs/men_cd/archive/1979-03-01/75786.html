                		<hr />        <p>      <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the hearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's (restricted) , forcing Helen and Scott to move on      to a rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens â€¦ just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we</em> all <em>can      read what the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      My husband and I have been happily married for five years      and will soon have our own homestead. We'd love to have      children, but, frankly, we're worried about the future. The      lack of available quality education, the problem of      pollution (especially nuclear), the possibility of economic      collapse, and the threat of war on an overcrowded planet      all seem to be good arguments against bringing young people      into the world. We'd appreciate your views on this subject.    </p>    <p>      In our childbearing years, we already had second thoughts      about having children . . . for the reasons you have aptly      outlined.    </p>    <p>      At present, the unsettled social conditions in the U.S.      preclude any possibility of bringing up children normally .      . . even in a secluded homestead environment. Television      and schools are sure to provide corruptive influences.      (However, a young neighbor of ours, Melissa      Coleman-when given cheap candy at a school Halloween      party-accepted it sweetly, didn't eat it, came home,      and put it on the compost pile. She was wise beyond her      years.)    </p>    <p>      Personally-as a woman-I've felt no deprivation      from lack of children . . . but, who knows, a few little      Scotties and Scottinas racing around might have been nice.      On the other hand, I happen to believe in reincarnation and      feel sure I've had hundreds of children in other lives and      will have many again. This particular life-free of my      own brood-has proved interesting and productive, and      there've been plenty of other people's children roundabout.    </p>    <p>      We've gotten our land, and-just as we'd      hoped-it's a good way from "civilization" . . .      <em>and</em> at the end of some pretty rough roads. What do      you think (in view of today's high gasoline prices) would      be the most practical vehicle for us to own?    </p>    <p>      Your choice of a vehicle will, of course, depend on what      you expect to haul: passengers, or heavy loads of      materials. For the latter, a pickup truck with four-wheel      drive is invaluable. It will use up more gas than a small      car, but the jobs it can do for you will probably be worth      the expense. If you're more interested in toting people,      get a small station wagon that will haul light loads      <em>and</em> passengers.    </p>    <p>      We find a four-wheel-drive pickup necessary on the farm,      and have a diesel runabout for long distance driving.    </p>    <p>      Have you ever kept pets such as a dog or cat? My parents      think that having such animals is a waste of time and food.      We have farm animals that I like a lot, but I'd love to      have a dog and cat, too. What do you think?    </p>    <p>      Vegetarians should not have pets, especially meat-eating      ones. Nor, thinks Scott, should any self-respecting person      own a self-respecting animal, as this involves an act of      slavery . . . one to the other. He asks: "Do <em>you</em>      keep the cat or dog, or does the animal keep <em>you</em>      to take care of <em>it</em> ?"    </p>    <p>      I have a cat that I dearly love, yet I definitely dislike      having to teed it cat food and keep it away from the birds.      This cat will be my last (but I've said that about the last      three or four I've had!).    </p>    <p>      You wrote (in MOTHER NO. 54) that you use soap powder for      laundry. I, too, preferred and used Duz soap powder until      earlier this year, when it disappeared from the grocery      shelves. Now, I can't find this product anywhere. The only      soap powder I've found to replace it is a gentle baby soap,      and I want the heavy-duty kind. Where do you think it might      be available, and what brand do you use?    </p>    <p>      I don't know much about brand names or availability. I have      a large supply of Fels Naptha boxes for my laundry, and      over a dozen ancient (and very hard) cakes of Ivory soap      that I can turn into shavings.    </p>    <p>      You've mentioned in previous issues that you sold your      maple syrup and your blueberries to cover overhead costs on      your homestead. What methods did you use to advertise these      products?    </p>    <p>      At sugaring time, we sent out a leaflet which gave prices      and so forth . . . put small ads in some magazines whose      rates we could afford . . . and had a 40-mile route that      covered a number of roadside stands which handled our      products. We usually took half a day each week to travel to      these stands and, by doing so, we kept in touch with our      store customers. People also came to the door to buy      directly from us.    </p>    <p>      It's been easier with blueberries. Folks come to pick their      own . . . either for the market price or on shares. We've      never had to advertise blueberries, but they're not easily      shippable anyway.    </p>    <p>      I'm a vegetarian . . . not only because of the economic and      nutritional factors involved, but because I believe it's      morally wrong to eat the flesh of once-living creatures.      Some of my friends say that- if it's wrong to eat      meat-it must also be wrong to eat plants. They point      out that plants are also alive, and-according to      recent research-can demonstrate a remarkable range of      emotions. That leaves me with nothing to eat!    </p>    <p>      What is your response to this kind of argument? Also, do      you take any types of supplements? And what do you do about      minor illnesses?    </p>    <p>      Surely, plants feel . . . and we apologize when we consume      them.    </p>    <p>      All forms of life have at least the rudiments of thoughts      and feelings . . . we're quite aware of that. We try to eat      as low on the sentient chain as possible. Fruits and      nuts-end products that the tree or plant is "finished      with"-might be the logical food solution.    </p>    <p>      In any case we must eat (and kill) something in order to      stay alive. In the new anti-cook book I'm writing, I have a      chapter entitled "To Kill or Not to Kill", and it discusses      the morality of taking any life.    </p>    <p>      As to supplements, when we travel abroad-and can't      get our usual good home food-we carry vitamins C, B,      and E with us. At home, we hardly need them, though we      recently started taking some B12 tablets. We drink our own      rose hip juice for vitamin C, put brewer's yeast in some      soups, and add wheat germ to applesauce.    </p>    <p>      For minor illnesses (do you mean colds?), we do what the      animals do: stop eating, go on liquids, and rest as much as      possible.    </p>
