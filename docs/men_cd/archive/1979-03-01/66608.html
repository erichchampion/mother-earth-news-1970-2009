                            <p>      Excerpted from The Book of <em>Kudzu</em> by William      Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi, copyright © 1977 by the      authors and reprinted with the permission of Autumn Press,      Inc., publisher. Available in paperback for $4.95 from any      good bookstore or for $4.95 plus 95 cents shipping and      handling from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739.    </p>    <p>      Kudzu (pronounced KUD-zoo in the Deep South and KOOD-zoo      most everywhere else) is a prolific leguminous vine of the      genus <em>Pueraria</em> , native to the Orient . . . the      Japanese call it <em>kuzu</em> (KOO-zoo). Introduced to the      United States in 1876, kudzu now grows more prolifically      throughout the Deep South than in any other part of the      world.    </p>    <p>      Kudzu's devotees point out that the plant combines the      virtues of several species: It has long been used for      erosion control, for livestock fodder, as a honey source,      and as an ornamental vine. Moreover, its leguminous roots      host nitrogen-fixing bacteria which enrich the soil by      providing a free and continuous supply of natural      fertilizer. Originally wild, kudzu is unquestionably a      super-plant, for it thrives without fertilizers,      pesticides, irrigation, cultivation, replanting, or even      care. The key question remains, however: "Is kudzu      super-good or super-bad?"    </p>    <p>      During the warm months, almost anywhere you travel south of      the Mason-Dix-on line or east of Texas, you can see great      billowing waves of kudzu washing over highway embankments      and invading farmlands in a riot of luxuriant foliage. In      its relentless search for more room, kudzu has spread like      wildfire across the landscape and generally proved itself      to be an unstoppable nuisance.    </p>    <p>      Whereas the Japanese practice a kind of agricultural judo      on kudzu, turning its overflowing energy to their      advantage, American farmers today usually curse and try to      eradicate this hardy perennial. They do not realize that      the "green menace" is, in fact, one of Japan's most honored      wild plants.    </p>    <p>      For the family who enjoys foraging for edible wild plants,      or the farmsteader who lives off the land from time to time      in order to make ends meet, the kudzu vine offers its      leaves, shoots, flowers, seeds, and roots for use in a      variety of preparations such as tempura, pressed salads,      sautéed vegetables, or pickles.    </p>    <p>      For the doctor, healer, or invalid who wishes to rely on      effective traditional remedies, kudzu powder is made into a      smooth and soothing thickened broth called Kudzu Cream (      <em>Kudzu-yu</em> ), which helps to develop an alkaline      constitution. It also provides quick relief from intestinal      and digestive disorders (particularly upset stomach and      acid indigestion), hangover, fever, colds, and a variety of      more serious ailments.    </p>    <p>      For the rural farm family, kudzu's leaves and green seeds      serve as a plentiful, easily harvested source of      nutritious, protein-and chlorophyll-rich livestock fodder,      or as an excellent mulch, green manure, or compost base.      And for the beekeeper . . . kudzu thickets provide a source      of unusually fragrant, flavorful honey.    </p>    <p>      For the conservationist and aesthete alike, cultivated      kudzu vines cover mile after mile of steep embankments      along roadways and railway lines the entire length of      Japan.    </p>    <p>      And "kudzu powder" (a literal translation of the Japanese      term <em>kuzu-ko</em> ) is a remarkable starchlike extract      of the kudzu root. (In natural food stores throughout      America, It is sometimes labeled simply "kuzu". The powder      comes in crumbly white chunks and has been used in Japan      since ancient times as a key ingredient in fine cuisine and      as an unusually effective natural medicine.    </p>    <p>      As versatile as it is delicious, kudzu powder can be      used-like arrowroot or cornstarch-as a      colloidal thickener in sauces or soups, or as a crispy      coating for deep-fried foods . . . like agar or gelatin, it      can also serve as a jelling agent, imparting delicate      texture and prized flavor to numerous treats and desserts.    </p>    <p>      Now widely available in the West at reasonable prices,      kudzu powder is imported from Japan in large quantities. It      will, we hope, soon be produced in America, since kudzu can      be cultivated in virtually any climate and kudzu powder can      easily be made on a home, community, or commercial scale,      using the roots of locally grown plants.    </p>    <p>      The tempestuous history of kudzu in America is so bizarre      that it is sometimes referred to as a "cosmic joke". Kudzu      was first brought to the United States from Japan in 1876:      It was grown in the Japanese pavilion at the Philadelphia      Centennial Exposition.    </p>    <p>      In the first stage of its history in America, from 1876      until 1910, kudzu was used as an ornamental shade plant. It      gained popularity for its decorative dense foliage, which      provided welcome shade on sweltering summer days and could      be used by gardeners to create a shielding background (to      block out the view of neighboring houses) or a lush      tropical effect.    </p>    <p>      The second stage, from 1910 to 1935, saw the development of      kudzu's use as livestock pasturage, fodder, and hay. David      Fairchild, who served in Japan as a plant explorer for the      U.S. Department of Agriculture, had noticed that wild kudzu      was used as pasturage, and he started some of the plants in      Washington, D.C., partially to test them for this purpose.    </p>    <p>      Further preparation for this stage began in 1902 when a      farmer in the Florida panhandle town of Chipley, Mr. C.E.      Pleas, became disappointed with the poor performance of his      ornamental kudzu. He yanked it up and replanted it near a      garbage pile behind his house. Nothing can match the fury      of a spurned kudzu plant, and within two years that pile      and much of the area around it were smothered by the      luxuriant vine and had never looked so good. However, it      was only after Pleas noticed that his chickens, cows,      goats, pigs, and horses all liked to eat the leaves that he      began to have an inkling of the plant's potential.      Believing that he had stumbled on a discovery that would      usher in a prosperous new era, Pleas set out with messianic      zeal as the first promoter of kudzu cultivation.    </p>    <p>      As early as 1907, kudzu hay had appeared at an exhibition      in Jamestown, Virginia and by 1917 the Alabama Agricultural      Experiment Station at Auburn had begun to study kudzu's      fodder value. In 1920 John Rigdon, pioneer conservationist      from Columbus, Georgia and agricultural agent for the      Central of Georgia Railroad, learned of kudzu's remarkable      growing speed and excellent nutritional value. He convinced      the railroad that the prolific plant, sold as fodder, could      provide them with extra freight to haul. And before long,      the railroad had initiated a vast program to provide free      plants and advice on how to grow kudzu for animal feed.    </p>    <p>      The third stage of kudzu's history in America, from 1935 to      1955, saw the plant burst into prominence in soil      conservation programs throughout the South. By 1935 the      South's soil and agrarian economy were suffering from      terminal malnutrition . . . the farmers were as poor as      their worn-out land, which had been depleted by decades of      careless and intensive planting in cotton, tobacco, and      corn. Only a miracle, it was believed, could save dear old      dying Dixie.    </p>    <p>      But the growing number of kudzu crusaders felt they had      just the answer, and careful experiments reconfirmed their      hunch: Not only did kudzu <em>grow</em> on hard, scarred      land devoid of topsoll ... it flourished. In fact, it even      revitalized the soil by giving back nitrogen-rich      nutrients. Moreover, its deep roots let it laugh at      drought. The reign of kudzu began in earnest when the      various agricultural agencies that sprang up during FDR's      New Deal joined forces with the crusaders. In 1933 Congress      established the Soil Erosion Service-which in 1935      became the Soil Conservation Service (SCS)-whose main      function was to keep the South from washing away. Among the      various plants that were tested as potential cover crops,      kudzu looked like the one that could do the job. But the      response of southern farmers was still cool: They were      aware of kudzu's aggressive growth pattern and feared that      widespread planting might result in its uncontrollable      spread and the loss of entire farms.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless, while its initial image was not entirely      favorable, additional experimentation and intensive      promotion changed kudzu's fortunes. And, by the late 1930's      the vine had been introduced into every southern state and      was reaching the height of its popularity. In 1939 the      first comprehensive (30-page) booklet about the new plant      was written by R.Y. "Kudzu" Bailey, the SCS regional      agronomist at Spartanburg, South Carolina and one of      kudzu's greatest proponents.    </p>    <p>      The fourth stage in kudzu's tempestuous and comical history      began in about 1955, when the very people who had promoted      the miracle vine so fervently started to become      disenchanted with it. As one southerner wrote: "It was like      discovering Ole Blue was a chicken killer." Kudzu now      turned on its masters. Once declared the savior of the      South, it gradually came to be considered at best a      nuisance, at worst a scourge. In 1976, on the 100th      anniversary of kudzu in America, newspaper headlines boldly      announced: "The South is fighting another war. . . and      losing once again."    </p>    <p>      Why has kudzu spread so rapidly? First, the South's      combination of a long growing season, a warm climate, and      plentiful rainfall create a uniquely favorable environment      for kudzu's growth. Second, in America the plant has almost      no natural enemies. (In Japan, by contrast, a less ideal      environment plus insect predators and disease keep the vine      in check.) And finally, the momentum of Its initial      propagation here was hard to slow down.    </p>    <p>      And why has kudzu declined in favor? Basically because too      much was expected of the plant, and its negative      aspects-initially glossed over-began to stand      out as southern farming moved into the modern era.    </p>    <p>      The lumber industry and U.S. Forest Service are kudzu's      strongest critics today, because it has been playing havoc      with timber production in the South . . . especially in      recent years, as more southern acreage was turned to      forests. Kudzu invades whole forests, climbing saplings and      even 100-foot-tall trees, patiently smothering them by      cutting off necessary sunlight with its dense foliage.    </p>    <p>      Telephone companies reportedly have trouble with kudzu      pulling down poles, and occasionally they have been forced      to run their lines underground. Power companies must spray      the plants at least once a year to prevent them from      sending tentacles sometimes as much as 80 feet up high      voltage towers, where they can short out transmission lines      and transformers, causing expensive damage. Highway      department crews use her bicides and mowers in their daily      skirmishes to try to prevent the plant from covering road      signs and guardrails or running out on shoulders and      bridges: Its spread keeps the sun off the pavement and      holds in moisture, which deteriorates concrete. Railroaders      also battle kudzu: They tell of how the vines can grow      across the tracks on grades and be churned into a slimy      mush under a locomotive's wheels, causing them to slip and      the train to stall.    </p>    <p>      Farmers dislike kudzu most when it sneaks onto their      property and damages crops and fruit trees, while providing      an unwanted haven for green snakes. It is still widely used      as pasturage for grazing livestock, but care must be taken      to prevent over-grazing, which can eventually kill the      plant.    </p>    <p>      It was perhaps only natural that as kudzu fell from favor,      it became the brunt of an almost endless stream of southern      humor. Among southern rural folk, it came to be known as      the "mile-a-minute vine" or the "foot-a-night vine". Kudzu      and bamboo were said to be the only two things that grow so      fast you can measure growth in miles per hour. An Arkansas      farmer once quipped, "When you plant kudzu, drop it and      run.''    </p>    <p>      Tifton B. Merritt, a southern journalist, gives the      following advice for cultivating kudzu:    </p>    <p>      <em>Choosing a plot</em> : Although kudzu will grow quite      well on cement, you should select an area having at least a      little dirt.    </p>    <p>      <em>When to plant</em> : Kudzu should be planted at night      to avoid neighbors seeing you and throwing rocks.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fertilization</em> : Forty-weight, non-detergent motor      oil applied to the underside of tender leaves prevents      their scraping when kudzu begins its rapid growth.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mulching</em> : For best results, as soon as the young      shoots begin to appear, mulch heavily with concrete blocks!    </p>    <p>      In the United States, there are two schools of thought      about what should be done with kudzu. The first school,      comprising most southerners, advocates eradication. The      problem is, nobody has yet found a practical way to stop      it. You can poison the vegetable medusa with any of a      number of newly developed, highly toxic herbicides, but      this method is very expensive and hard on the environment      and repeated applications are required over several years.      The poisons also kill all nearby plants and make the land      unfit for growing other crops for 6 to 12 months . . .      exposed to the elements, the large areas of land on which      no other crops will grow are subject to severe erosion.    </p>    <p>      The second school feels that we should start using kudzu      creatively instead of complaining about it or trying to      kill it. Granted, kudzu now has an image problem and is      suffering from a bad press, but that can always be changed.    </p>    <p>      With the rise of modern chemical agriculture and advanced      Western technology, kudzu's key roles have been replaced by      more up-to-date and convenient equivalents: chemical      fertilizers, soy-and-grain fodders, concrete embankments.      Yet Dr. Jake Tinga, a horticulturist with the University of      Georgia's Agriculture College Experiment Station, notes:      "With the costs of fossil fuel, fertilizer, irrigation      systems, and other agribusiness necessities steadily going      up and up, farmers may start to reexamine some less      sophisticated, less expensive methods of production. "    </p>    <p>      In the same vein, kudzu is beginning to attract interest      among the present generation of Americans interested in      living self-sufficiently, closer to the land and in greater      harmony with it.    </p>    <p>      Researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee are      investigating the use of the vines and leaves for fuel and      the use of the root as a fermentation substrate for the      production of both baker's yeast and ethanol fuel.      Moreover, they have found that the root seems to provide      all the vitamins needed for a very nutritious food and      support for yeast fermentation.<br />      Let us hope that the coming years will mark the inception      of a fifth phase in kudzu's American odyssey. Already, work      is underway in a number of diverse areas to relate to kudzu      in new and creative ways:    </p>    <p>      [1] Kudzu powder is now being used in lieu of lower-quality      cooking starches and is featured in some of America's      finest natural food restaurants. We may soon even witness      the rise of a new southern delicacy, kudzu candy!    </p>    <p>      [2] Kudzu Root Tea and Kudzu Creams are being used by      naturopaths and appearing in their books on healing.    </p>    <p>      [3] Organic farmers in northern states are experimenting      with planting kudzu. (In the colder, drier climate growth      can be kept under control.)    </p>    <p>      [4] Several people have shown interest in starting the      first commercial kudzu shops in the West to supply      high-quality, natural powder and root at domestic prices.    </p>    <p>      Before long, the South may come to be viewed as a treasure      trove bursting with "white gold" just waiting to be      harvested. When this day arrives, kudzu will have found its      true home in America . . . this time for real.    </p>    <p>      The tender young parts of the kudzu plant make a delicious      vegetable that may be gathered wild for free. (Avoid      gathering the older leaves and shoots, which are generally      quite fibrous.) Wash thoroughly before use, then try      serving them in your favorite salads, soups, sautéed      dishes, and casseroles.    </p>        <h3>      Kudzu Leaves with Sesame Dressing:    </h3>    <p>      Boil young leaves, wrap in a cotton dishcloth and press      with several pounds of weight for 10 minutes. Dice fine and      dress with a mixture of 2 tablespoons tahini (or substitute      sesame or peanut butter creamed with 1 teaspoon water).      1-1/2 tablespoons vinegar, 1 teaspoon honey, and 1/2      teaspoon salt (or 1-1/2 teaspoons natural soy sauce).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Steamed Roots</strong> : Since ancient times, kudzu      roots have been used in Japan as, an emergency food in      times of famine. Gathered during the fall or winter, when      they are rich in starch, they are cut into cubes, steamed      or boiled, and served seasoned with natural soy sauce,      miso, or salt.    </p>    <p>      Kudzu powder may be substituted for flour, arrowroot, or      cornstarch as a thickening agent in most recipes. Use the      following proportions:    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon kudzu powder = 3 teaspoons flour<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons kudzu powder = 3 teaspoons arrowroot<br />      4-1/2 teaspoons kudzu powder = 3 teaspoons cornstarch    </p>    <p>      Acidic liquids such as lemon juice require 10 to 15 percent      more kudzu powder for thickening or jelling than water or      alkaline liquids such as apple juice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dissolving Kudzu Powder:</strong> Combine the      powder and cold liquid in a small bowl or cup. Stir well,      then mash any remaining lumps with fingertips. Pour through      a small, fine-mesh strainer into cooking liquid, retrieving      all kudzu from bowl with a rubber spatula. Dip strainer in      cooking liquid to rinse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Apple Pie with Kudzu-Apple Juice Glaze:</strong>      This old-fashioned pie with its opalescent glaze contains      no sweetener, yet has its own delicious natural sweetness      and delicate texture. The glaze also does nicely atop any      of your favorite fruit or vegetable pies (onion, kabocha,      or pumpkin are especially good) as well as tortes and      cheesecakes.    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup whole wheat flour<br />      3/4 cup unbleached white flour<br />      1/4 teaspoon salt<br />      3 tablespoons (sesame) oil<br />      1/3 cup water<br />      1/2 egg white (optional)<br />      4 (pippin) apples, thinly sliced<br />      1-1/3 cups apple juice<br />      1/3 cup raisins<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/2 teaspoon lemon juice<br />      2 tablespoons kudzu powder    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 400° F. Combine flours and salt, mixing      well. Add oil and rub mixture gently between palms to blend      evenly. Gradually add water to form a dough and knead for 2      minutes, or just until smooth. Roll out round on a floured      board and use to line a nine-inch pie plate. Flute edges,      prick bottom with a fork, and brush, if desired, with egg      white. Bake for 30 minutes, or until nicely browned.    </p>    <p>      While crust is baking, combine apples, 1/3 cup apple juice,      and raisins in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and      simmer for 15 minutes. Mix in 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and      lemon juice, remove from heat, and allow to cool.    </p>    <p>      While apples are simmering, combine kudzu powder and the      remaining 1 cup apple juice in a small saucepan, stir until      dissolved, and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 1 minute,      or until transparent and nicely thickened.    </p>    <p>      Spoon cooked apples into baked crust and smooth surface.      Pour kudzu glaze evenly over the top, then allow to cool to      room temperature. Cover and refrigerate. Serve chilled,      topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon.    </p>
