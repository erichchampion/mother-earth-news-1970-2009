        [1] Artichokes are close kin to the similarly shaped wild thistle. [2] Although they're usually grown for their edible flowerets ... 'chokes make an attractive addition to any garden. [3] Harvest the flower buds before the leaves start to open. They can be trimmed and filled with your favorite stuffing for a spectacular treat that will charm the most discriminating gourment. [4] Artichokes are just naturally decorative, as well as delicious. [5] The bases of the leaves, the stem, and?especially?the ""heart"" can all be eaten. Check your cookbooks for special recipes... or [6] serve this elegant vegetable (with lemmo-and-butter sauce) as a simple but lickin' good ginger food.
