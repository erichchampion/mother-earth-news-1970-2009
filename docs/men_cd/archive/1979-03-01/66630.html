                <p>      <strong>This inexpensive craft is easy, fun... and it      sells!</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      <strong>----by WANDA      CORNELIUS----</strong>    </h5>        <p>      Figuratively speaking. Barney Munnerlyn of Arkansas can      make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Barney, you see,      fashions "pewter" objects out of tin cans . . . lovely      creations he calls "fairy lanterns".    </p>    <p>      For the past five years, these decorative and functional      art-objects-from-waste have (along with other crafts)      become a full-time profession for Barney. And he's quick to      tell you that he "loves every minute" of the work.    </p>    <p>      Prior to 1970, however, Munnerlyn sold insurance and didn't      enjoy that job in the least. But, one of the shops that he      visited in the "line of duty" was a crafts store, and the      beads that were sold there caught Barney's interest. It      wasn't long before Munnerlyn quit the insurance business to      set up his own crafts shop, where he designed and sold      original jewelry and copper butterflies mounted on      driftwood plaques.    </p>    <h3>      THEN ONE DAY    </h3>    <p>      Barney came upon the idea for his lanterns accidentally.      One day, as he welded two butterfly wings together, he used      his torch to carve his name in the side of a tin can. That      simple act set him to thinking: If he could carve out his      name, then he could cut designs in the containers as well!      Munnerlyn produced tin butterflies first, but he decided      that he liked the copper ones better. Then, when Barney      finally decided to make something out of whole cans, fairy      lanterns were born.    </p>    <p>      These decorations have been such a success that the      craftsman now travels 12 months out of the year . . . to      demonstrate his work at art and craft fairs all over the      country. Between shows, Barney returns to Little Rock to      replenish his supplies and answer mail requests for the      lanterns, which are priced between $3.00 and $7.50.     </p>      <h3>PRACTICE MAKES PRETTY    </h3>    <p>      These attractive tin lanterns don't require a lot of      equipment, either. You'll need, first of all, an acetylene      torch and a steady hand to go along with it. Besides the      torch, you will, of course, have to have an empty can      (anything from a soup can to a No. 10 will do), some      galvanized clothesline wire, a pair of pliers, a wire      brush, goggles to protect your eyes, and a flameproof      surface to put under the can while you work.    </p>    <p>      The first step is to light the torch and get the flame down      to a pencil-lead size. Then-using about three-fourths      of an inch of space on the small cans and a little over an      inch on the largest-"burn" out a scroll-like design      around the edges of the top and bottom rims.    </p>    <p>      Next, cut some evenly spaced, vertical lines around the      center of the can to within a quarter-inch of your scrolled      borders. On taller models, you may want to break the      vertical lines into two sections and leave a narrow      (decorated or solid) strip in the middle of the can.      (Either way, it's best to go over the cuts to be sure you      haven't "missed" any spots.)    </p>    <p>      After the can is cool to the touch, rub it diligently with      a wire brush to get rid of the small pieces of loose metal      and any paint that might have been on the original      container. (Or-if you're well-versed in the use of      your torch-you can increase the size of the flame,      move far enough away so it doesn't cut the container, and      simply burn the paint off.)    </p>    <p>      Once the can has its "pewter" finish, work from the inside      and push out the strips with your fingers until the desired      height is reached. Then, put the can on a hard surface . .      . push down to make it level . . . attach the wire handle .      . . and-presto!-you have a delightful fairy      lantern that can hold a candle, a flower arrangement, or a      potted plant.    </p>
