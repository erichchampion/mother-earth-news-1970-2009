                        <p>      <em><strong>Want to try something different (and delicious)      in your garden this year? Then take a tip from<br />      Juanita Browne, and cultivate...</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Though many folks are unfamiliar with artichokes, these      plants are among the most beautiful and versatile additions      that you could make to your garden. Their decorative      gray-green leaves, stately pineapple-shaped heads, and      blue-purple, thistlelike flowers are pretty enough to adorn      a flower bed or to be mistaken for a piece of fancy      shrubbery . . . and there are endless ways to cook 'em!    </p>    <p>      Artichokes (Cynara scolymus) are usually considered a      vegetable, but they're actually an herb of the Compositae      family, native to the Caribbean region. The plants were      introduced into the United States-in Louisiana and      California-by French settlers, Spanish explorers, and      Italian immigrants.    </p>    <p>      Those transplanted herbs found central California      particularly to their liking, and-as a      result-about 90% of all of America's commercially      grown artichokes are found near Castroville, California ...      a town that really deserves its title of "Artichoke Capital      of the World". The tasty plants thrive in this frost-free      region of cool, foggy summers and light, sandy soil . . .      but artichokes can be cultivated in other climes, too! I      know, because I've grown 'chokes in the dry, hot San      Fernando Valley as well as in the foothills of the Sierra      Nevada . . . where early and late frosts-and some      heavy freezes-are common.    </p>    <p>      So, if you have rich soil, can protect the plants against      freezing, and will mist the leaves to prevent dehydration,      chances are that you'll produce a reasonable artichoke crop      no matter where you live . . . and, if you do, the harvest      will more than make up for your efforts!    </p>    <h3>      WHERE TO GET 'EM    </h3>    <p>      Artichokes can be grown from seed, but this method is      "chancy" at best. Although seeds might produce a good      plant, they may also yield an herb that has reverted to its      thistle heritage . . . because artichokes don't always grow      true to variety.    </p>    <p>      You can avoid this problem entirely, however, if you      transplant sections of rootstock (commonly called      "stumps"), or use offshoots (sideshoots) taken from the      base of an old plant.<br />      And-if you have a choice-rootstock will produce      better plants than offshoots will . . . since the stumps      provide stored nutrients that immediately force new leaf      and root growth. A root section of several inches in      diameter and six inches or more in length can-if it's      planted after spring frosts are over-give you a small      crop of artichokes during the very first year.    </p>    <p>      The sucker offshoots, however-which should be dug in      the spring when they're about 10 inches high-take      another year or two to produce. And, even if small buds do      appear on these plants the first year, they should be      pinched back to build up the artichoke's strength for a      more productive second season.    </p>    <p>      If you can't get rootstock cuttings from a friend or at      your local nursery, you can order them from the following      sources:    </p>    <p>      Giant Artichoke, 11241 Merritt Street, Castroville,      California 95012 and California Nursery Company, Niles      District, Fremont, California 94536. Prices range from      $1.25 to $2.50 per root, and you'll want the variety with      tender, delicious green globes. (The purple globes have      beautiful flowers, but most people don't consider them      worth eating.)    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO PLANT 'EM    </h3>    <p>      Artichokes need a sunny location, but-in especially      hot, dry areas-the plants will do better if they      receive some shade during the hottest part of the day.    </p>    <p>      ‘Chokes also prefer well drained, friable soil that's      heavily enriched with compost and manure. Should you have      heavy dirt, it's best to break up the subsoil and "lighten"      it with ashes, coarse sand, peat, or grit.    </p>    <p>      After you've prepared the soil, place your plants three to      four feet apart, with the stumps six to eight inches deep      and the base of the new leafy shoots just above the ground.    </p>    <p>      You'll generally find that a half dozen plants will provide      enough artichokes for a small family. However, a whole row      along a fence would make a practical (and attractive)      addition to any garden.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO KEEP 'EM HEALTHY    </h3>    <p>      Be sure to keep weeds away from your new plants to prevent      competition for soil nutrients, and-since artichokes      like nitrogen-feed them several times a season with a      mulch of manure and rich compost. Also, you must water the      plants frequently and deeply, and mist the leaves any time      they show signs of wilting.    </p>    <p>      Once an artichoke is established, it'll grow and produce      vigorously for four or five years. After that time,      however, the plant should be dug up and divided, and its      rootstock replanted.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO HARVEST 'EM    </h3>    <p>      Artichokes grow to a height of three feet or more and      spread to about six feet in diameter. In the spring, the      plant will begin to send up shoots from its permanent      crown. (A young artichoke may produce only one shoot, while      older plants might send up a dozen or more.) Each      individual shoot then forms a cluster of large rosette      leaves, a stalk grows from the center of the leaf cluster,      and several buds are formed on the elongated stalk.    </p>    <p>      These globular buds-which are really immature flower      heads-contain the parts of the plant that you eat.      When they reach anywhere from two to four inches in      diameter (and before the individual bud leaves start to      open), they should be harvested. To do this, cut the stem      at a point about one-and-a-half inches below the base of      the bud. (In the California fog belt, artichokes can be      picked from early winter through spring. In most regions,      however, the buds will not mature until late spring and      early summer.)    </p>    <p>      After all the buds have been harvested from a stem, it will      bend over and the leaves will show signs of dying back.      When this happens, cut the stem at its base and keep      removing these old bearing stalks throughout the year. New      shoots will grow from the base of the old stump, and these      will develop their own fruiting canes.    </p>    <p>      If your area suffers from cold winters, you should cut back      all of the foliage in late November and protect the plants'      crowns. I cover my artichokes with a deep pile of hay,      but-in hard-freeze areas-it may be necessary to      invert a box filled with mulch over the crown, and then      mound soil two feet deep around and over the box. Then,      when all danger of frost is past, just remove the box and      the mulch, and start "feeding" the plants with a good dose      of compost or manure.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO COOK 'EM    </h3>    <p>      The tender base of the bud leaves, the fleshy part of the      flower base (the heart), and the tender stem are the edible      parts of the artichoke. They can be served hot or cold, and      they're delicious . . . whether marinated, stuffed,      pickled, dipped, sautéed, puréed,      souffléed, dried, fried, or "souped". (Check out      French and Italian cookbooks for dozens of ways to prepare      this versatile herb.)    </p>    <p>      I like to serve (and eat!) artichokes as a "finger food" .      . . dipped in a sauce made of 1 cup of melted butter and      1/4 cup of lemon juice. The succulent buds are delicious      when eaten this way, and are no trouble at all to prepare.    </p>    <p>      First, to get rid of any "creepy crawlies" (such as earwigs      or aphids), soak the artichokes in salted ice water for 30      minutes, then rinse them and remove their small, tough,      bottom leaves. If you want to be especially elegant, cut      off about one inch of the top leaves and trim the tips of      the remaining fronds with kitchen shears.    </p>    <p>      After that, simply place the buds on a steamer rack above      an inch or so of boiling water, then cover the pot and let      it steam gently for 30-45 minutes ... or until the base of      the artichoke can be easily pierced with a fork.    </p>    <p>      Finally, when the artichokes are done, lift them out of the      pot with tongs and turn them upside down to drain. (You may      want to save the vitamin-rich water for soup stock, etc.)    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO EAT 'EM    </h3>    <p>      When you first sit down to a platter of steaming artichokes      and a tub of butter sauce, don't let "good manners" blind      you to plain old common sense . . . because this is one      food that just about has to be eaten with the fingers. Just      pick off the outer leaves-one by one-and dip      their lower, fleshy ends into the sauce. Then, pop the      buttery leaf-ends into your mouth, pull 'em between your      front teeth to strip off the delicious "meat", and      nonchalantly toss aside the leathery upper portions.    </p>    <p>      When you've eaten most of the outer leaves, you'll reach a      "fuzzy" central core. This is called the "choke", and it's      just above the most luscious morsel of all . . . the      "heart" of the artichoke. All you have to do is lift      out-with a sharp knife-and discard the furry      center, cut up the heart and stem that remain, dip the      pieces In your butter sauce, and enjoy a flavor that'll      fulfill your most exotic gourmet desires!    </p>    <p>      And while you're eating, you'll be glad to know that      artichokes are high in vitamins and minerals, and low in      calories, (they average between 50 and 60 calories per      bud). In fact, these tasty plants are proof positive that      not everything enjoyable is-as the old saw      says-either illegal, immoral, or fattening!    </p>

[2] Although they're usually grown for their edible flowerets ... 'chokes make an attractive addition to any garden. [3] Harvest the flower buds before the leaves start to open. They can be trimmed and filled with your favorite stuffing for a spectacular treat that will charm the most discriminating gourment. [4] Artichokes are just naturally decorative, as well as delicious. [5] The bases of the leaves, the stem, and?especially?the ""heart"" can all be eaten. Check your cookbooks for special recipes... or [6] serve this elegant vegetable (with lemmo-and-butter sauce) as a simple but lickin' good ginger food.
