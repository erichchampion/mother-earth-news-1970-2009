        <p>My whole home was built with used and leftover building materials. It sits on a bit of land my parents gave to me. Money was really tight, so my first house was a small, very used travel trailer, also given to me.</p><p>To add more room to the trailer, I tore down a neighbor’s building and was able to reuse every part of it. I then bought lumber from an Amish sawmill and enclosed the trailer, adding a front room, bedroom and front porch. I bought tin roofing at a lumberyard for $200 - someone had not used all they ordered. After insulating, I covered the walls with drywall I bought at a discount - it had been slightly damaged in transit. I bought windows for $5 from a neighbor who was cleaning out his garage. The porch posts and railing were made from timber cut on the property. The concrete driveway was free - a friend who works for a concrete company gave me leftovers from other jobs.</p><p>My home isn’t completely done yet, and it won’t be a palace, but it’s made of hard work and fond memories. I wanted to share what I’ve been able to achieve with time, patience and help from family and friends.</p><h5>- Mike Edwards<br />French Lick, Indiana</h5><p><em>To learn more about debt-free living, read Rob Roy’s</em> Mortgage Free!
