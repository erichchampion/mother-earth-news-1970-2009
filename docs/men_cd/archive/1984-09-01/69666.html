            			<p>			<strong>Economic outlook</strong>     </p>        <p>      Probably the single biggest threat to our national      economy-and to our own individual abilities to make ends      meet-is the likelihood that the billions of dollars loaned      by U.S. banks to various Third World countries will never      be repaid. And, with that likelihood inexorably moving      toward certainty, we think that the following essay by Vern      Myers, whose wisdom has graced this column often in the      past, can provide a worthwhile description of what the      overall effects of that default might be. Now, we're not      saying that Vern's predictions are 100% sure, mind you, but      we are saying that he's been too danged right too many      times in the past to be safely ignored! (Excerpted courtesy      of Myers Finance & Energy, Suite 310 Peyton Building,      Spokane, WA 99201.)    </p>    <p>      "There is no chance of any principal being repaid for a      decade or more."-Henry Kissinger.    </p>    <p>      Let's you and me take it as a fair statement that the debts      [of the Third World countries] are not going to be paid for      at least ten years-if ever.    </p>    <p>      How is this to come about, and what is the likely effect on      us? Here are the possibilities:    </p>    <p>      [1] The debtor countries will declare a default-and      the banks will go broke.    </p>    <p>      [2] The banks will declare the debtor countries in default,      and the banks will go broke.    </p>    <p>      [3] Neither the banks nor the debtor countries will cry      default, but the debtor countries will just stop      paying-de facto moratorium.    </p>    <p>      [4] The debtor countries will pay a little bit of interest      once in a while.    </p>    <p>      The scenarios in [1] and [2] above will not happen. The      debtor countries would have nothing to gain and would only      be cutting their throats to declare a moratorium or a      default. The banks would bring the ax down on their heads      right away rather than suffer gradual severance. In the      process of gradual destruction, there is always a chance      they might get away.    </p>    <p>      The third and fourth are the most likely probabilities, and      the fourth is a little more likely than the third, because      the debtor countries mostly don't have even the money to      pay full interest. This will produce a gradual public      deterioration of bank credibility, and in confidence that      banks can survive. What we are looking at, then, is the      total demobilization of $300 billion or $400 billion that,      up to now, we included in the liquidity of our Western      monetary system.    </p>    <p>      Let's face it, as long as the situation can go on this way,      the U.S. government is not going to pay the banks, and it      is not going to pay the debtor countries. So there will be      no extra dollars floating around on that account. Indeed,      the net result of this will be a great tightening of the      existing liquidity. Banks will become very tightfisted,      will take few chances. It's a period of contraction in      lending.    </p>    <p>      If any banks should go broke in the process, this will      bring on a further tightening of credit and a further      reduction of liquidity. In this kind of an atmosphere,      business will not expand. Everything will be pointing to a      contraction. This knowledge is widespread enough now to      bring on an inevitable contraction in the marketplace and      through the general public. People facing this will buy      less. Unemployment will increase.    </p>    <p>      It's a mystery to me how so many of these writers can      holler, "More inflation." Where does the inflation come      from? Where is there a plentiful money supply? We have just      said that over $300 billion in the liquidity barrel is      leaking out and will eventually come right out of the      barrel. Let the Fed try to put in funds at the rate they      are disappearing or being destroyed. And we have only      started so far. No way in God's world can the Federal      Reserve of the United States handle this global problem.      Even if some extra money is created by the Fed, it will be      as a drop in the bucket compared with the general climate      of contraction and the huge loan losses suffered and      finally admitted.    </p>    <p>      We may not have dramatic bank failures only a chorus of      gaspings as some of them go under almost unnoticed.    </p>    <p>      The interest payments which the banks have counted on must      be stricken from the books. The earnings statements that      accountants look at when they advise on the reasonable      price of a stock will be drastically knocked back because      of the loss of this interest. Also, loans will necessarily      have to be written down by degrees. We are not going to      bury this corpse in one piece. We'll hack him up and do it      gradually. But the smell will be around, and the days of      plentiful money-the era of inflation-will have been      banished for a long, long time to come. What we are facing,      therefore, is a deflation starting out mildly at first and      growing more severe as time passes. And the results of that      will be classic.    </p>    <p>      [1] Cash will be king, and the same amount of dollars in      cash will buy more next year than this year, and still more      the following year. This will be a reversal of a 30or      40-year trend, when the idea was always to owe a lot of      money so you could pay it back with cheap dollars. Now if      you owe a lot of money, you'll pay it back with more      expensive dollars, or it will be foreclosed, and you will      lose the article you have bought.    </p>    <p>      The population is not ready for this.    </p>    <p>      Deflation cannot be stopped by a simple move of printing      more money by the Fed. Creating more figures in books does      not <em>stop</em> a shrinking economy. The idea that      printing mountains of money results in an inflationary      depression is baloney. There is no such thing as an      inflationary depression. A depression means that there is      very little money around. So how can you possibly and      ridiculously have an inflationary depression, which some      newsletter writers mouth around as if it were a real and      honest-to-goodness term. They read it somewhere, and they      think it sounds good. Plentiful money and tight credit do      not coexist.    </p>    <p>      [2] In the second place, there is absolutely nothing in the      wings now to indicate any grounds for a gold standard in      the world.    </p>    <p>      The United States is way too short of gold to impose a gold      standard on the world. And the only way a gold standard      will be imposed on the world is through a mighty economic      power making absolute declarations of what will be money      and what money will be worth. The U.S. long ago slipped      from that position of power. No other country is in any      position to even think of introducing such kind of money      either by itself or in conjunction with others.    </p>    <p>      The result will be that the price of gold will have no      justification for going up or even staying where it is      while other prices are going down.    </p>    <p>      Gold is about 11 times its 1967 price, while other      commodities are about three times. There is only one set of      circumstances under which gold could make a significant      rise. That is wild inflation-which, we have just seen, is      not about to happen. As an alternative then, gold ought to      be priced near where the average commodity is. That would      be between three and four times its official price and      certainly no more than five or six times. It would look to      me as though $250 would be a maximum ceiling on gold.      Either gold will be down around that figure, or it will be      up well over the $1,000 mark.    </p>    <p>      People will not be buying gold when they need bread.    </p>    <p>      Countries will not be buying gold until it is part of the      world monetary standard.    </p>    <p>      Commodities like silver and platinum will go down along      with other commodities, but they will not fall      proportionately with gold. Later on, because of their      worldwide scarcity and their worldwide strategic necessity,      they will recover in price before other commodities.    </p>    <p>      The stock market cannot possibly survive in such a climate,      any more than a tomato can grow in Alaska in the winter.      The stock market is due for a fall of several hundred      <em>points-riot an adjustment</em> -a smash.    </p>
