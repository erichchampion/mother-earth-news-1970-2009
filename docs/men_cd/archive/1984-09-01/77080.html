                        <p>      <em>If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous,      he will not bite you. This is the<br />      principal difference between a dog and a man.</em>    </p>    <p>      -Mark Twain    </p>    <p>      Well sir, though it ain't got cold enough yet to make the      ticks quit the woods, fall seems to be lookin' over the      ridges here at Plumtree Crossin'. An' whilst I hate the      thought of puttin' in an honest day's work as much as the      next man (an' probably a clang sight more'n most!), my      woodpile has got to the point where it won't take "no" fer      an answer.    </p>    <p>      So I guess it's downright providential thet I was rummagin'      through my closet a few days ago-tryin' to locate my      long-handled underwear-an' come across a letter from      of Bill Bragg Jr., from up by Casper, Wyoming. 01' Bill-fer      those of you who haven't heered of him-is a downright      <em>prolific</em> raconteur an' prevaricator (why,      sometimes I don't even know iffen I can believe his      <em>name),</em> with a passel of books to his credit.    </p>    <p>      In this particular missive, though, he wanted to pass along      a story by another feller from up in the Equality State, a      tale what Mr. Bragg hisself has been known to relate at      such august gatherin's as the Wyoming Mining Association's      annual meetin's. So, whilst I'm out back tryin' to figger      how to get a wedge through some of that dadburned      curly-grained sweet gum, you folks can set back an' enjoy      the followin' story. I'll jist let Bill introduce it to you      the same's he did in his letter to me.    </p>    <p>      * * *    </p>    <p>      <em>A newspaperman named Bill Nye in Laramie in the 1870's      turned into a would-be miner and went prospecting in      one</em> of <em>the many booms that flared up in that area      from time to time. He wrote an essay on his dog, and I have      always liked it.</em>    </p>    <p>      Some dogs are prized for their faithfulness, others for      their sagacity, and still others for their beauty. My dog      was not noticeable for his faithfulness, because he only      clung to me when I did not want him, and when I felt lonely      and needed sympathy and deep devotion, he was always away      from home.    </p>    <p>      He was not very sagacious, either. He was always doing      things which, in the light of chastened experience and      cooler, calmer afterthought, he bitterly regretted. Thus,      his life was a wide waste of shattered ambitions and the      ghastly ruins of what he might have been.    </p>    <p>      Neither did I prize him for his beauty, for he was brindle      where there was any hair on him and red where there was      none, and he had, at one time, dropped his tail into a camp      kettle of boiling water, so that when he took it out and      looked at it sadly, he was surprised to see that it looked      like a sausage.    </p>    <p>      When visitors came to my camp at the Boomerang Consolidated      and I gave them lunch, my dog would sit near them and look      yearningly at them, and pound the floor with his      bald-headed tail, and lick his chops, and follow each      mouthful of the lunch with such a hungry, hopeless look      that the visitors wished that they were dead.    </p>    <p>      When I first went out to the mining camp, I did not have      any dog. I was not poor enough. After a while, however, by      judicious inactivity and my aesthetic love for physical      calm, I got poor enough. So that I knew I ought to procure      a dog, and thus herald my poverty to the world. I also      desired a constant companion who would share my humble lot      and never forsake me.    </p>    <p>      I secured a dog, which I named Entomologist. Do you know      what an Entomologist is? He is one who makes large      collections of antique bugs and pecular insects, and      studies their characteristics and peculiarities.      Entomologist seemed to be entirely wrapped up in his      collection of insects, and they were very much attached to      him. He had a good many more insects on hand than he really      needed, especially fleas. Entomologist introduced into      Slippery Elm Gulch a large, early, purple-top, Swedish flea      that had an immense run in camp. Most everybody got some of      them. He was very proud of his collection of singular and      peculiar fleas. It was about all he had to be proud of,      except his appetite.    </p>    <p>      Entomologist had a wild, ungovernable desire for food that      made him a good deal of trouble. He would keep his      unnatural appetite under control for days and weeks      together, and then he would yield to it and become its      willing slave again.    </p>    <p>      He would eat too much during the day, and at night he would      creep into my tent and fill the air with his vain regrets.      I used to try every way to make him overcome his corroding      grief, and at last I got to throwing pick handles and      drills and packsaddles and large chunks of specimen quartz      and carboniferous profanity at him in the night, to see if      I couldn't convince him that it was better to suffer on in      silence and smother his woe than to give away to such wild      and robust grief.    </p>    <p>      One night he did not come home, and I feared he had fallen      down the shaft into the lower level of the Boomerang. I      found him, however, down at Dobe Abraham's, trying to eat a      twenty-five-foot rawhide lariat. It seems he had swallowed      fifteen feet of it before he discovered that the other end      was tied in a hard knot to an iron picket pin. When he      discovered this, he had moved to reconsider, but the motion      was defeated. I untied the lariat, however, and let      Entomologist swallow it and go home. Then I went to the      owner and purchased the lariat. I had one at home just like      it, but I thought that it would be as well for Entomologist      to have one of his own. I would do anything for my dog. I      did not wish to neglect him while he was alive, for I knew      I would regret it some day, if he were to be taken from me.    </p>    <p>      One day in the mellow autumn, I went over to town to      purchase grub for the winter and took Entomologist with me.      He ran around a good deal and tasted almost everything; but      he knew his weakness and did not yield to it [at] first.      Finally, he found some soft plaster of paris that had just      been mixed near a new home. He had eaten a good many      things, but he had never tasted plaster before, so he ate      what there was.    </p>    <p>      It was the effect of a blind impulse, and not the result of      Entomologist's more mature judgment. Ah, how rashly the      best of us sometimes fly into the face of Providence, and      in later years we struggle in tears and agony of spirit to      overcome the foolish action of an unguarded moment.    </p>    <p>      That's the way it was with Entomologist. Five minutes after      he ate that plaster, he felt as though years of integrity      and self-denial could not overcome this rash act. He lost      his old vivacity and never came up to me any more to lick      my face with his warm, damp tongue or put his cool, wet      nose in my ear and sneeze, as he was wont to do when he was      well. He gradually lost all interest in his fleas and      allowed them to shift for themselves.    </p>    <p>      Although he did not moan or complain, I could see that      little Entomologist was climbing the golden stair. One day,      just as the sun was lighting up the west and glorifying the      horizon with its royal coloring, Entomologist rolled up      into a small, globular wad, and died. He died without a      struggle, but I always knew that he would die easy. If it      hadn't been easy, he wouldn't have done it. He never would      do anything that was difficult or required a struggle.    </p>    <p>      As I write these lines, memory takes me back to those days      of the long ago; and while the scalding tear wells up anon      to my eyelids and falls upon the pages before me, a large      paperweight, white and symmetrical, is lying by my side,      and on it is written:    </p>    <p>      Plaster cast of Entomologist<br />      Taken by himself (interior view),<br />      He bit off more than he could chew .    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Bill Bragg, author of Wyoming: Wild and      Wooly, is a well-known western writer.
