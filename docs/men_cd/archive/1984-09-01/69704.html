    <p>
                <p>      The federal government may approve wider use of a      controversial method of preservation...    </p>            <p>      The hazards imposed upon all life forms by today's      worldwide arms race prove beyond question that Dwight      Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" program has been an utter      failure. The development of nuclear power plants has      undoubtedly abetted the spread of the bomb to a steadily      lengthening list of countries. And, in any event, atomic      electricity seems on the verge of being declared an      economic bust. What's more, practical uses for      bombs-such as the foolhardy scheme for excavating new      Panama canals-have, thankfully, never materialized.      There is, however, one vestige of Ike's program that, after      30 years of dormancy, is enjoying a new burst of      enthusiasm.    </p>    <p>      Food irradiation, the process by which edibles are      preserved by being bathed in heavy doses of gamma      radiation, was first put into practical use by the U.S.      Army back in 1953. The Quartermaster Corps found that      irradiated rations would last much longer than food      preserved by conventional means, such as heat. Onions, for      example, would stay fresh for 16 months, whereas      <em>untreated</em> bulbs would sprout within 90 days.    </p>    <p>      Since the 1950's, food irradiation has seen limited      practical application in the U.S. (The meals packaged for      our astronauts provide one celebrated example of the      technique's success.) On a commercial basis, stored wheat      and white potatoes have been treated since 1964, and, in      July of 1983, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)      decided to allow the use of up to one megarad (a million      rads, which is a unit of absorbed ionizing energy) to      retard the growth of microbes in spices. The FDA also      allows the export of irradiated foodstuffs to any of the      roughly 20 countries that permit the practice.    </p>    <p>      The lack of general acceptance of irradiation for food      preservation in the United States stems from the Food,      Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1958, which classified      irradiation as a food <em>additive,</em> rather than as a      processing technique. As a result, irradiation's proponents      have had to prove that treating food with gamma radiation      poses <em>no</em> hazards to human health. Of course, a      chemical food additive can be tested with comparative speed      and ease by administering large doses of the substance to      animals. However, the same approach can't be used with      radiation: Exposing food to doses thousands of times      greater than the norm simply destroys it. Furthermore,      there are limitations on how much food can be fed to a      laboratory animal. As a result, expensive and lengthy      studies of long-term (chronic) effects are required.    </p>    <p>      And as you'll soon find out, thorough examinations of the      effects on humans of eat ing food that's been treated with      radiation have <em>not</em> been done. Nonetheless, the FDA      is under heavy pressure to approve additional uses of the      technique. In November, 1983, Representative Sid Morrison      of Washington introduced legislation that would reclassify      irradiation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as a      food-processing technology. This would allow the FDA to go      ahead with its intention of permitting irradiation with up      to 100 kilorads (a tenth of a megarad) on most foods.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EASY NOW</strong>    </p>    <p>      The very word <em>irradiation</em> will bring on a      quickening of the pulse in many people. In fact, the topic      is sensitive enough to require that we be cautious about      jumping to conclusions. If there's one thing that all of      the people embroiled in the controversy agree on, it's that      there's <em>no</em> residual radiation in irradiated food.      But, by the same token, we need to be careful about      accepting the general proclamations of safety that are      being widely issued in favor of the process. Food      irradiation is fairly simple in concept but has very      complicated ramifications.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ATOMS FOR PIZZA</strong>    </p>    <p>      A basic food irradiation unit costs about $2 million, so we      shouldn't expect to be putting up our garden vegetables      with a home irradiator any time soon. The device consists      basically of a thick concrete chamber with a pool of water      for a floor. Racks of food are introduced into the      processor, and radioactive rods are lifted from the pool.      The distance between the food and rods, the time of      exposure, and the intensity of radiation determine the      total dose.    </p>    <p>      Radiation displaces electrons (the phenomenon is called      ionization), producing what are known as <em>free      radicals.</em> At exposures of around 100 kilorads,      sufficient free radicals are produced to inhibit cell      division in anything living in the food. Higher levels (a      megarad or more) kill all organisms. Today, the widest use      of irradiation is to cleanse hospital instruments; about      40% of the medical sterilization in the U.S. relies upon      this technique.    </p>    <p>      The most popular irradiation material is cobalt 60, though      cesium 137 is also effective. (Electron beams and X rays      work, too, but are less efficient and more costly.) Most of      the cobalt 60 used for food preservation is salvaged from      the waste products of the Canadian-designed CANDU reactor,      though it could be separated from the waste of most      reactors. Cesium 137 is a by-product of nuclear weapons      material processing.    </p>    <p>      Both the nuclear power industry and mili tary processors      would be delighted to see food irradiation achieve wider      acceptance. Radwaste that is now a major disposal problem      could become a commercially useful product. Of course,      these substances would eventually end up as waste for the      food irradiation industry. Cobalt 60 has a half-life of 5.3      years, so its usefulness is limited. From a concerned      citizen's viewpoint, however, the material at least would      be considerably less radioactive when it finally did become      waste.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IS IT HEALTHY?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Though there's no radiation to be found in food that's been      zapped, there <em>are</em> chemical reactions brought on by      the bombardment. Some of the nutritional components in the      edibles are altered, and substances called <em>radiolytic      products</em> are formed. Most of these changes aren't      particularly unusual or alarming. Treatment with heat      reduces food value, too, and the majority of the radiolytic      products formed are found in other types of consumables.    </p>    <p>      Irradiation destroys several vitamins-including A,      some B's, C, and E-and appears to affect important      nutritional compounds such as proteins. So if irradiation      is added to the list of systems used to process food,      there's very likely to be an overall loss of nutritional      value.    </p>    <p>      Exposing comestibles to gamma rays also produces some      radiolytic products that are <em>not</em> normally found in      food. Over 40 of these compounds have been identified, but      very little is known about their health effects. Most of      the studies have been inconclusive, though there is some      evidence that consuming irradiated food may cause      reproductive and mutagenic effects. Polyploidy-the      development of abnormal white blood cells in      children-has shown up in two Indian studies on      monkeys fed wheat irradiated with 74 kilorads.      Additionally, Indian studies have found that irradiation      causes an <em>increase</em> in aflatoxin (a potent      carcinogen) in wheat that contains the aspergillus fungi.      Research has also turned up testicular tumors and kidney      disease, and the incidence of other health effects has been      shown to be related to the level of radiation dosage of      food fed to test animals.    </p>    <p>      Amazingly enough, though about 20 countries have been using      irradiation for a number of years, no population studies      into possible health effects have been done. And of the 413      animal studies the FDA reviewed in 1982, 344 were found to      be inconclusive, 32 showed adverse health effects, and 37      were interpreted as evidence of safety. This pretty well      typifies the current state of knowledge about the risks of      irradiation. No definite threats to human health have been      identified, but precious little evidence confirms the      supposedly benign nature of the process.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Irradiation is not a food processor's panacea. It requires      a major capital investment to get started, and skilled      staff must operate and maintain the equipment. Irradiation      also just isn't suitable for some jobs. Most fresh fruits      and vegetables can't successfully be preserved with the      technique, because it causes browning and abnormal      ripening. Dairy products aren't likely to receive the      treatment either, because it causes unpleasant odors.    </p>    <p>      The use of gamma rays to control spoilage of meat has been      widely heralded as a way to reduce the use of nitrites and      nitrates (which can form cancer-causing nitrosamines), but      you should keep in mind that, at most, the use of these      substances can only be cut by 80%. Irradiation has also      been heralded as a replacement for dangerous pesticides      such as EDB. With some foods-Hawaiian papayas, for      example-the technique is very effective, but doses      great enough to cleanse citrus fruit cause cosmetic damage.      In short, radiation treatment may be able to replace some      of the dangerous additives and pesticides now used on our      food, but it won't do away with all of them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</strong>    </p>    <p>      At this time, we don't believe that there's enough evidence      concerning the effects of food irradiation upon which to      base a decision about its safety. If you're ardently      antinuclear, you may choose to oppose irradiation simply      because it might breathe a little life into the nuclear      industry. On the other hand, if you're strongly opposed to      the use of pesticides and chemical food additives, you      might rationally see a lot of promise in irradiation. For      those of us who take issue with both the nuclear and      chemical industries, the choice is difficult.    </p>    <p>      Whether you choose to support or resist irradiation of      food, you should know that the passage of Representative      Morrison's bill could remove the requirement for labeling a      food as treated with radiation. Even the euphemistic      preferences of the irradiation industry-"processed      with picowaves" and "processed with ionizing energy" are a      couple of examples of the sort of phrasing proponents have      offered-would be preferable to no labeling at all.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the best approach to the problem has been expressed      by Dr. John Gofman, a medical physicist and expert on the      health effects of radiation (see the Plowboy Interview,      issue 68): "The kind of epidemiological study required to      find out whether or not a diet of irradiated food will      increase (or possibly decrease) the frequency of cancer or      genetic injuries among humans simply has not been done ....      It is probable that we shall never know whether or not      irradiated foods are safe .... I have no objection to the      sale of irradiated food to willing buyers-provided      that the buyers are not tricked into buying it (a) by false      claims about its safety and/or (b) by inability to detect      that irradiated food is what they are buying."    </p>
