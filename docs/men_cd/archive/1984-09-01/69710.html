                <p>      Increase your garden's productivity with low-cost,      manageable, season-extending structures.    </p>          <h5 id="byline">by Johanna Linch</h5>        <p>      One harvest, two harvests, three harvests, four ...Wouldn't      it be wonderful to be able to grow fresh fruits, flowers,      and vegetables for your table all year round?      Unfortunately, for most of us the growing season is limited      to just a few months out of the year. Cold, wind, and      excessive precipitation dictate when and for how long      plants will grow. Until soil and air reach a certain level      of warmth, for example, flowers and vegetables cannot      germinate. And, at the other end of the scale, they go      dormant-or die altogether-when temperatures      drop below a certain point. Then too, heavy seasonal rains      can drown young seedlings, wash them out of the soil, or      beat them into the ground, while strong winds occasionally      batter and break tender leaves and stems. All this means      that, without special help of some kind, most plants can      only be cultivated between the dates of the last spring      frost and the first frost in autumn or during the benign      days between the end and new beginning of the rainy,      superhot, or storm seasons. In some areas this results in a      growing season of two months or less-too little time      for many of the most desirable crops to mature.    </p>        <p>      There are ways to bypass the weather, however, by giving      plants the environment they need to flourish <em>out of      season.</em> Structures such as the greenhouse, the cold      frame, and the hotbed can all provide the necessary      microclimate for crops to be started earlier in spring and      allowed to mature deeper into autumn. Still another way to      control the environment is through the use of      <em>cloches.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>BELLING THE CROP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cloches-a term that means "bells" in      French-have been used extensively in the garden since      the 1800's. To advance their crops for market,      nineteenth-century French gardeners placed bell-shaped      glass jars over individual seedlings to protect them from      frost and to give them warm, undisturbed surroundings in      which to grow. These early cloches had no holes for      ventilation, so they had to be tilted and propped open with      a stick or stone when excessive heat or moisture built up      inside. Because each individual plant had its own cover,      maintaining adequate ventilation for a large crop was      tedious and time-consuming; furthermore, storage of the      glass bells from one season to the next required a lot of      space and sometimes resulted in costly breakage. Therefore,      over the years gardeners have sought ways to improve on      this basic design; and although empty peanut butter and      canning jars-modern versions of yesteryear's elegant      glass domes-are still used today, new devices made      with metal and plastic have greatly improved the situation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM INDIVIDUAL</strong> <strong>TO MASS      COVER</strong>    </p>    <p>      One commonly used-and effective-individual      cloche is made from the ubiquitous plastic gallon or      half-gallon milk bottle. The bottom is cut out, and the      bottle is set directly over the plant. Ventilation is      provided when the bottle cap is removed; the translucent      sides help to diffuse some of the sun's fiercest rays;      storage is comparatively easy (bottles can be strung up by      the dozen if you simply run rope through their handles);      and the cost is ...well, about as minimal as you can get.      In fact, many potential bottle cloches can be found      littering the roadside.    </p>    <p>      A step beyond the individual cloche is the tent cloche      ...or its somewhat roomier cousin, the barn cloche. The      tent cloche consists of two panels of glass or clear      plastic that lean together at the top, forming a triangle      with the ground as baseline. Such a design can straddle a      number of plants, although-because of the steep angle      of the sides-usually only one row can be      accommodated. Open at both ends, the tent cloche affords      less protection than the classic bell jar, but it offers      considerably better ventilation ...without needing to be      propped open. Tent cloches can be made from salvaged      windows that are hinged together or leaned against angled      posts, from plastic-covered frames, or from panels of sheer      glass or hard plastic. Patent clips are available to hold      such panels together at the top, but duct tape is also      effective and certainly less expensive.    </p>    <p>      The barn cloche looks like a small, transparent house with      two long sides and a peaked roof. It can span several      closely spaced rows, and can accommodate relatively tall or      bushy plants. It's also somewhat more difficult to build      and more expensive than either of the two above-mentioned      designs.    </p>    <p>      Both the tent cloche and the barn cloche are portable, easy      to use, and easy to store. Their chief disadvantages lie in      their size-which is generally limited to, say, three      or four feet in length-and their open ends, which may      admit too much cold air or wind-driven rain. The size      limitation means that it takes several of them, set end to      end, to cover a normal row of plants. They are also      somewhat limited in the width to which they can be spread      open, so they aren't very practical for wide-bed planting.    </p>    <p>      Somewhere between the bell jar and tent is the      umbrella-style cloche, which is simply a big, lightweight      (usually made with plastic sheeting) dome. Like the bell      jar, it may need to be propped open for ventilation; like      the tent, it can cover a number of plants. It's      particularly suitable for small, broad-sown beds.    </p>    <p>      Still another option is the tunnel cloche, which is about      as close to a greenhouse as one can get. The tunnel cloche      stretches over a long row-nineteen or twenty feet is      not uncommon-and can span a four-or five-foot-wide      bed with ease. It consists of a frame covered with      translucent material, usually clear plastic sheeting. Its      chief advantage lies in the great area it can cover, which      suits today's wide-bed style of cultivation. Its chief      disadvantage is that it's hard to move from one site to      another. Certain types, such as those made of heavy      reinforcing wire that's permanently covered with plastic,      are cumbersome and dif ficult to store, relocate, or even      open for ventilation ...although they could probably keep      plants safe from all but a hurricane. Another variety      utilizes spring-steel hoops thrust into the ground and then      overlaid with plastic sheeting. The plastic is clamped in      place with a second series of hoops that fit over, or      beside, the first ones. Hoops can also be made from lengths      of reinforcement rod or half-inch PVC pipe that are then      covered with plastic sheeting.    </p>    <p>      Whatever the shape, size, or material, any of these cloches      can significantly affect the site in which crops are to      grow, trapping the radiant energy of the sun to heat the      enclosed soil and air; protecting the area from wind, rain,      and frost; and in general supplying a suitable climate for      young plants.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN EMERGENCY TUNNEL</strong>    </p>    <p>      At MOTHER's Eco-Village we use various methods to help      extend the season, including south-facing beds with      protective rock walls that provide shelter and heat-storing      thermal mass ...hotbeds warmed with deep-dug, decomposing      organic materials ...and a variety of structures or devices      such as greenhouses and cloches. Some of the latter are on      trial for possible later incorporation into the EcoVillage      routine, and others are in regular use.    </p>    <p>      Then again, some come into being because of an emergency.      Such was the case with our PVC tunnel cloches.    </p>    <p>      You see, we needed a cover photograph featuring "My      MOTHER's House" for our <em>Homebuilding and Shelter      Guide</em> (stock No. 64162, available from Mother's      Bookshelf for $12.95 plus $1.50 for postage and handling).      Now, magazine articles, promotional pieces, cover art, and      other published items must all be put together      weeks-even months-before they're printed and      released. So, although we wanted to show the house with its      summer garden, the photograph had to be taken at the      beginning of May ...less than a week after the last spring      frost and long before summer flowers and vegetables would      be ready. To solve the problem, our gardeners decided to      start the necessary seedlings in a greenhouse in midwinter,      and then build tunnel cloches to cover the long beds in      front of the house, which would permit the young plants to      be transferred early to their permanent location and allow      them to mature in time for the camera.    </p>    <p>      Experience with plastic-covered reinforcement wire cages      had taught our staff that these unwieldy structures would      be unsuitable for the five-foot-wide beds that had to be      covered. Attempts to find spring-steel hoops and      double-clamped plastic failed. Ten-foot-long iron      reinforcement rods proved to be very difficult to bend into      hoops. Tunnel cloches made of half-inch PVC pipe seemed the      best answer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAKING THE PVC CLOCHE</strong>    </p>    <p>      The basic construction of a PVC cloche is simple. Lengths      of the white plastic pipe are cut (in MOM's case, to ten      feet), bent into semicircles, and pushed down over lengths      of rebar that have been driven into the ground on either      side of the bed to be covered. A hacksaw for cutting and a      sledgehammer for driving the rebar are the only tools      needed.    </p>    <p>      A rebar "tent stake"-ours were each two feet      long-is first sunk into the ground at either end of      the tunnel-to-be, angled slightly away from the bed itself.      Heavy, clear plastic that's ten feet wide and seven mils      thick is stretched over the hoops and pulled together into      a bunch at either end. Rope is wound around each bundle and      pulled tight, then stretched around the staking rebars and      knotted (see photograph). Tension holds the plastic in      place-down along the ground when the cloche is shut,      or partway up the sides when a bit of ventilation is      required. To allow full access to air and sun, the plastic      can be pushed all the way up and over the top of the hoops      so that it accordianpleats on the other side. Should the      cover become loose, one need only tighten the slipknot that      holds the plastic to the stakes.    </p>    <p>      We had no trouble with this structure, even though it was      subjected to wind, rain, and frost. It <em>was</em>      tiresome, later in the season, to have to drop everything      and run to ventilate the cloche around 9:00 or 10:00 in the      morning so the plants wouldn't get cooked! After several      days of this, however, our gardeners decided to risk frost      damage, and removed the plastic altogether. By that time,      the plants were hardened off and mature enough to be      unaffected by the still-chilly spring nights.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOM'S TIMETABLE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our summer-garden-in-spring project began in January with      the planting of seeds in the Eco-Village greenhouses. As      the young plants developed, they were transferred from ger      mination flats to prick-out flats, then to containers (the      sizes of these were varied to suit the plants). On April      22, the tunnel cloches were set up over the beds in front      of the house to warm the soil. Around April 25, the      assortment of plants was transferred to the cloche. They      thrived in their new, protected environment. And beginning      on May 3-eight days after planting and only three      days after the last frost-the plastic covers were      removed and photographs taken.    </p>    <p>      Now, this timetable isn't one that we'd recommend to the      average vegetable gardener. However, for us it served the      dual purpose of supplying needed photographic material and      testing the effectiveness of the PVC tunnel cloche.      Furthermore, MOTHER's gardeners found the latter easy to      construct, use, and take down once the job was done: The      plastic cover was untied and removed, and the PVC pipes      were pulled off their rebar posts and stored next to an      outbuilding. All in all, the cloche proved a great success.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHOOSE WHAT'S</strong> <strong>RIGHT FOR      YOU</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our specific problem called for a tunnel cloche, but      <em>you</em> might be better off with a different design.      Each type has its own virtue; and if it's a waste of time      and energy to use dozens of plastic bottles in a garden      consisting of twelve or fourteen 20' rows, it's equally      counterproductive to build a tunnel cloche if you're      cultivating a small, circular bed. So if you want to extend      the season with one of these devices, select the type that      suits <em>your</em> garden and <em>your</em> resources      ...and then be prepared to reap the rewards: fruits,      flowers, herbs, and vegetables that you can start early in      the season and harvest-after later sowings-well      into winter's cold.    </p>
