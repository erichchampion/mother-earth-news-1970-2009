                    <p>      <strong>Part I</strong>    </p>        <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor <em>of</em> Population Studies      and Professor <em>of</em> Biological Sciences, Stanford      University) and Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate,      Department <em>of</em> Biological Sciences, Stanford) are      familiar names to ecologists and environmentalists      everywhere. But while most folks are aware <em>of</em> the      Ehrlichs' popular writing in the areas <em>of</em> ecology      and overpopulation (most <em>of us</em> -for      instance-have read Paul's book The Population Bomb),      few people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (the type that tends to be      published only in technical journals and college texts).      That's why we're pleased to present this regular      semitechnical column by these well-known authors/      ecologists/educators.    </p><h5 id="byline"> by Anne and Paul Ehrlich</h5>    <p>      Although there's still considerable debate about details,      the basic outlines of the past few million years of human      evolutionary history are clear. The study of fossils has      taught us a great deal about our distant relatives.    </p>    <p>      About four million years ago, our ancestors were fully      upright creatures only about four feet tall, with brains of      about 350 to 450 cubic centimeters (cc) in      volume-roughly a third as large as those of modern      people. Because the first remains of these ancestors were      discovered in southern Africa and were thought to be of      apes, the creatures were placed in a genus named      <em>Australopithecus</em> -the "ape of the south."    </p>    <p>      The oldest fossil <em>Australopithecus</em> found so far is      a creature from the Afar triangle of northern Ethiopia, who      lived about three and a half million years ago. <em>A.      afarensis</em> , discovered by paleontologist Don Johanson      and his colleagues, became famous when the first fossil      specimen was nicknamed Lucy, and Johanson published a fine      book under that title.    </p>    <p>      <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> gave rise over several      million years to two subsequent australopithecine species:      A. africanus and A. robustus-both of which were a      little taller and had somewhat larger brains than Lucy. The      last <em>Australopithecus</em> died out perhaps one and a      quarter million years ago. But a couple of million years      before that, the australopithecines had given rise to an      important branch-the one leading to us.<br />      <br />      <strong>Tracing the Human Line</strong><br />      <br />      The earliest known member of the <em>Homo</em> line was a      creature called <em>Homo habilis</em> . It was a      contemporary of the australopithecines, lived some two      million years ago, stood about five feet tall, and had      brain size of around 460 cc. <em>Homo habilis</em> was      followed, about a million years ago, by <em>Homo      erectus</em> . Members of <em>H. erectus</em> were quite      similar to modern people; they average about five and a      half feet tall and had brains overlapping size with today's      <em>Homo sapiens</em> (700 to 1,250 cc as opposed to 1,000      to 1,800 cc)    </p>    <p>      Fossils of <em>H.</em> <em>erectus</em> ate abundant and      widespread, and historically have been given a variety of      names including " <em>Pithecanthropusereetus</em> " and "      <em>Sinanthropus pekinenses</em> ." With a shave, a      haircut, and modern clothing. an average male Homo erects:      would probably cause little comment if seen on the street      today. And there's good reason to believe that our      progenitors of a million years ago also had a highly      developed culture.<br />      <br />      From <em>H.</em> <em>erectus</em> to modern <em>H.</em>      <em>sapiens</em> , and its minor "neanderthal" variant, was      a mere hop, skip, and jump. Indeed, the basic      <em>Australopithecusik erectus/H. sapiens</em> sequence      constitutes a superb fossil record, one with essentially no      "missing links." It's only because of a keen interest in      our own history that people even bother to search for more      fossils from the past four million years of our ancestry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our Primate Cousins</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are, of course, no paleontologists among the gorillas      and the other great apes, but extensive searches for their      fossils have been made by their human cousins. However, we      still lack a recent fossil record of the apes.      Consequently, the exact relationships among gorillas,      chimpanzees, orangutans, gibbons, and human beings are not      known. The fragments of fossil apes that have been found      date from about 1 5 million years ago and are adequate to      sort out the history of the branching lines the hominid      side, there's about a 10-million-year gap before Lucy, and      on the ape side, the gap runs right up to the present.    </p>    <p>      But comparisons of living forms make the general rela      tionships among the high primates crystal clear. Evidence      from anatomy, shared malarial organisms and parasitic      worms, chromosome structure, biochemical similarities,      behavior, and so on, all indicate that people, gorillas,      and chimpanzees have a more recent common ancestor than the      African apes have with the Asiatic gibbons and orangutans.    </p>    <p>      After separation from the Asian apes, an African stock      evidently split into the homiinid and ape lines, and then      the ape line split again into gorillas and chimps      <em>.</em> Human beings are probably about equally related      to chimps and gorillas, and that relationship is "close" by      almost any taxonomic standard.    </p>    <p>      Although the gorillas are the largest of the great apes,      they were the last to be discovered by      science-indeed, they were long confused with the      chimps. It wasn't until 1847 that they received a formal      scientific description based on skulls and some other bones      collected in Gabon by Thomas Savage, a medical missionary.      He and Harvard zoologist Jeffries Wyman gave the gorilla      the Latin name <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> .    </p>    <p>      The original geographic distribution of the gorilla appears      to have constituted an arc from Zaire, Rwanda, and Uganda      in the east up through the Central African Republic to the      West Coast-Cameroon, Gabon, and Congo-Brazzaville.      The distri bution of the gorillas appears to have been      limited by their inability to swim (the Congo River seems      to have been a barrier to the spread of gorillas into the      rain forests south and east of the river) and by their      avoidance of open country.    </p>    <p>      Three subspecies of gorillas are recognized: <em>Gorilla      gorilla gorilla</em> on the West Coast ... <em>G. g.      graueri</em> in the central African lowlands ...and <em>G.      g. beringei</em> , the "mountain gorilla," best known in      the Virunga volcano area. The differences among the three      races are small. For example, the western and mountain      races differ in the alignment of the "thumb" of the foot      and in the shape of the head and face. <em>Gorilla g.      graueri</em> tends to be intermediate between the other      two.<br />      <br />      <strong>How We Compare</strong>    </p>    <p>      The differences between gorillas and human beings are more      striking. The average cranial capacity of gorillas is less      than half of ours, and their posture is predominantly      quadrupedal. Like most other mammals, the gorilla's      backbone forms a bridge between fore and hind legs, from      which the internal organs are slung. The hole through which      the spinal column enters the skull is at the back. In      contrast, all hominids are bipedal, with the skull balanced      on top of the spine (and the hole at the bottom) and the      internal organs dropped into the cradle of the      pelvis-making us susceptible to hernias.    </p>    <p>      There are, of course, also many <em>minor</em> anatomical      differences. Gorillas, for example, have large canine      teeth. These are especially prominent in the males, who      threaten and fight with them. And gorillas have much bigger      molars than we do, which they use 10 grind up coarse      vegetarian diet. l lie, are also hairier, heavier, and      stronger than <em>Homo sapiens</em> .    </p>    <p>      Next to people, the gorillas are the most terrestrial of      the apes-the mountain gorillas, especially, spend      little time in the trees. And, unlike humans or chimps,      they are strictly vegetarian. It's ironic that their      fearsome reputation is totally undeserved. Gorillas ramble      in small groups through the forest, devouring a wide      variety of plant (including the bark of trees) and posing      no threat at all to other animals.    </p>    <p>      Gorilla groups ordinarily consist of a dominant "silveback"      male, sometimes a second silverback, often a younger      "blackback" male three or four mature females and three to      six immature individuals. If a group is approached by      surprise, the silverback will interpose him self between      his family and the intruder, giving the others a chance to      flee.    </p>    <p>      The defending silverback is an imposing creature, weighing      perhaps 350 pounds and standing almost six feet tall. He      can produce an impressive display: among other things,      hooting, standing on his hind legs, beating his chest, and      thrashing his arms in the vegetation. Then he may charge.      If the intruder doesn't retreat, the charge will typically      end in front of its target. Then the silverback will drop      to all fours and move off to the side.    </p>    <p>      A fleeing intruder, however, is pursued and bitten, often      on the buttocks. A gorilla bite is considered a great      disgrace among poachers-as well it might be, since a      person need only stand his ground with a spear in front of      him to have an excellent chance of slaughtering a charging      silverback.<br />      <br />      <strong>The Intelligence Question</strong>    </p>    <p>      The question of the relative intelligence of gorillas,      chimps, and people is a controversial one. It's now      generally agreed that apes don't speak because they lack      the appropriate vocal apparatus. Both chimps and gorillas      have been taught to communicate in sign language, although      the similarity of that communication to human speech is      still debated.    </p>    <p>      The gorilla Koko, trained by Penny Patterson, is      disarmingly humanlike in some of her communication. For      example, she called a zebra, on first sight, a "white      tiger." And after she had broken a sink, Koko      attempted-in all too human a fashion-to fix the      blame on one of Penny's assistants, signing "Kate there      bad."    </p>    <p>      When she was six and a half, Koko had a vocabulary of      almost 400 signs and scored about 85 on a Stanford-Binet      I.Q. test-even though the test was humanbiased. (For      example, to the question "Where does one shelter from the      rain?" Koko answered "tree"; the "correct" answer was      "house.")    </p>    <p>      Gorillas and chimps both show the ability to solve problems      with flashes of insight-such as piling up boxes and      climbing on them to get bananas otherwise out of reach.      While for a time people believed chimps to be smarter than      gorillas, the consensus now is that the two African apes      are similar in intelligence but different in character.    </p>    <p>      Whatever the evolutionary relationship of these gentle      giants to <em>Homo sapiens,</em> their ecological      relationship is precarious. As we shall see in our next      column, humanity may be in the process of exterminating one      of its two closest relatives.    </p>    <p>      For an introduction to gorillas, see Dian Fossey's Gorillas      in the Mist (Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1983) and George      Schaller's The Mountain Gorilla: Ecology and Behavior      (University of Chicago, Press, Chicago, 1976). More      technical information can be found in A.F. Dixon's The      Natural History of the Gorilla (Columbia University, New      York, 1981) and T.L. Maple and M.P. Hoff's Gorilla Behavior      (Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1982). Money is badly      needed to help preserve the mountain gorillas.
