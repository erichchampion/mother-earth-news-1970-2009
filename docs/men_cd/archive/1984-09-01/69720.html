                <p>      You can keep an ear on your good old woods-wandering Bessie      with these homemade...    </p>          <h5 id="byline">By Alden Stahr</h5>        <p>      If you've ever heard the gentle tinkling of cowbells on the      evening air as a herd of milkers slowly wended their way      across a distant pasture, then you know what a calming      effect those peaceful chimings can have on a body after a      hard day's work. Maybe you even long to re-create those      subtle sounds by hanging a copper bell around your bovine's      neck (especially if the critter's given to hiding in the      woods!). Then again, perhaps you've got a nostalgia-loving      friend or relative who'd appreciate an authentic cowbell as      a Christmas gift. Unfortunately, real copper bells are      pretty hard to find nowadays, and the ones that are      available (in antique stores, usually) are priced out of      many folks' range.    </p>        <p>      Of course, you could always make your own ...in which case      you might be able to enjoy those memorable (and practical)      sounds for only pennies a bell! About all you'll need to      produce one cowbell is a square foot of 16-ounce (23to      24-gauge) copper flashing, which you can find at a      junkyard, a hardware store, or a craft supply shop. If you      want a louder bell, use galvanized sheet metal or a heavier      copper.    </p>    <p>      Besides the main ingredient, you'll have to round up      cardboard, a pencil, scissors, offset tin snips, a hammer,      a cold chisel, flatglass pliers, a handful of self-tapping      screws or copper rivets ...as well as a 3/16" eyebolt with      a 1"-long stem, a lock washer and nut, wire or string, a      short (or sawed off to 1/2") carriage bolt, and long-nosed      pliers.    </p>        <p>      <strong>DESIGN WORK</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you've gathered up all your supplies, copy the      pattern-shown in the illustration accompanying this      article-onto the piece of cardboard. Then cut out the      model, fold it where indicated to form the "skirt" of the      bell, and either tape or paper-clip it together to make      sure the proportions are right. Should it not fit together      neatly, make whatever adjustments are needed. Then, when      the pattern checks out, open it up and trace it onto the      sheet of copper.    </p>    <p>      Now, using the offset tin snips, cut the metal to shape.      That done, measure and scribe the inside lines with a sharp      utensil... and, using a hammer and cold chisel, score the      copper along these lines, being very careful not to cut all      the way through the metal as you do so. Next, bend along      these scored lines, using a pair of pliers, to form a      slant- sided bell. Drill small holes at the appropriate      places (as indicated in the illustration), and fasten the      form together with self-tapping screws or copper rivets.    </p>    <p>     <strong>MAKE IT RING</strong>    </p>    <p>      To finish off your bell, you'll need to make a clapper.      Begin this operation by drilling a 1/16" hole in the top      center of the bell and another 1/16" hole in the stem of      the 3/16" eyebolt. (In order to center-punch and drill this      second hole, you'll probably <em>first</em> have to grind      or file a flat place on the side of the bolt thread.)    </p>    <p>      Next, place the 1" stem of the eyebolt down through the      newly drilled hole in the top of the bell, leaving the ring      up top to serve as a hanger. Then-working inside the      skirt-place a washer and nut on the eyebolt stem and      tighten them with a pair of long-nosed pliers. With this      assembly in place, thread a thin strip of wire (or heavy      string) through the hole in the bottom end of the bolt and      twist (or tie) it securely. Now you're ready to mount the      clapper!    </p>    <p>      This noisemaker can be easily manufactured out of a short      (or sawed off to 1/2") roundheaded carriage bolt. After      filing the thread flat on one side, center-punch and drill      a 1/16" hole through the stem. Thread the wire (or string)      into this hole, and pull the clapper up into the bell.      (Make sure it's in far enough to strike the inside bottom      edge of the skirt.)    </p>    <p>      There you have it ...an authentic handmade copper cowbell      fit to ring round Bessie's neck, or to decorate a parlor      shelf.    </p>
