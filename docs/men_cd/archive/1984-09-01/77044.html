                    <p>      <strong>For the Armchair Farmer...</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Farm Show</em> magazine features the latest      agricultural equipment offerings, ranging from the      eminently practical to the merely curious. Among the      latter, we found a radio controlled tractor scheduled for      production in 1985. The first commercially available model      that can be controlled completely by radio and laser      automatic pilot, the truck-like vehicle allows its      owner-with the aid of a small TV screen-to      plow, disk, plant, spray, and cultivate from the comfort of      his or her farm office. The cost of such indolence can be      high, however: $100,000 for a relatively small 100-HP      tractor.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Sweeping It Under the Rug Hasn't      Helped</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      When government regulations forced manufacturers to clean      up the air in the immediate vicinity of their factories,      companies began pumping sulfur emissions high into the      clouds, distributing contamination over a wider      geographical area. To comply with existing environmental      legislation, chemical firms stopped dumping their residues      directly into the river and began bottling them and burying      them in the ground, often dangerously close to important      groundwater sources. The result of this type of "cleanup,"      according to the Conservation Foundation's new "State of      the Environment" report, is that pollutants have simply      been shifted from one part of the environment to another.      The report calls for a concerted effort to control      contamination across the board, rather than allowing      hazardous material to be exported to areas where the      regulations don't apply.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Au Clair de Lune</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      A study reported in <em>Science</em> magazine doesn't go as      far as to recommend planting crops by the moon, but it does      indicate that lunar influence on the weather-and hence on      agriculture-may be greater than we think. Previously, only      the sun has been implicated in periodic atmospheric changes      that produce longterm weather patterns, but researchers      studying tree-ring samples taken on the Great Plains have      discovered an 18.6-year drought cycle that may be linked to      cycles of the moon. The scientists' findings suggest that a      conjunction of solar and lunar cycles might even have been      responsible for the dust bowl of the '30's.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>First Viral Insecticide      Introduced</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Farmers have a new biological tool for controlling the      ubiquitous <em>Heliothis</em> caterpillar, more commonly      known as the corn earworm or tobacco budworm. The control      is a virus, the first insecticide of its kind and fatal      only to members of the <em>Heliothis</em> clan. One      pill-size capsule is sufficient to infect an acre of cotton      with the rapidly proliferating virus. In the U.S. alone,      the viral insecticide could annually replace more than a      million pounds of the chemical insecticides used on cotton.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Lead in Small Doses</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Lead in the environment may be somewhat more dangerous than      has been supposed. According to a study conducted on lab      animals by two Texas A&M University scientists, even      low levels of the element may have serious health      consequences.    </p>    <p>      Their research reveals that very low levels of lead      exposure can cause increased anxiety or tension, which      could contribute to the misuse of alcohol or depressant      drugs, and that larger doses significantly suppress      response rates, a condition that might eventually interfere      with learning abilities.    </p>    <p>      The researchers also challenge the traditional position      that lead is harmful only to young organisms. Adults had      been thought to be relatively immune to the effects of lead      exposure, but the Texas study indicates that they may be      more vulnerable than earlier tests have indicated.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Bear Barter</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      In South Carolina, bears are getting rather scarce      nowadays. Arkansas, on the other hand, has an abundance of      them, but Ozark residents have long been envious of South      Carolina's native and plentiful population of grouse. So,      <em>Outdoor Life</em> magazine tells us, the South Carolina      Wildlife Federation made a deal with Arkansas: 120 South      Carolina mountain grouse for 6 live-trapped Arkansas      hill-country bears. Biologists are watching to determine      the success of the swap, which might serve as the pattern      for a more extensive stocking program in the future.    </p>
