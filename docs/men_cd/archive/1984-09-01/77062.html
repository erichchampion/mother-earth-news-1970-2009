                   <p>      <strong>Safety, Selection, Milling, and      More!</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Stopping By Woods<br />      Chain Saw Safety<br />      Chain Saw Sense<br />      Chain Saw Lumber Mill<br />      Chain Saw Skills    </p>    <p>      <em>If you're building a log structure and have lots of      time but not much money, read on as ...</em>    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      Mother Tests Two Chain Saw Mini-Mills    </h2>          <p>        Put simply, a chain saw lumber-milling attachment is a        device that clamps to the guide bar of a saw and rides        down a rail attached to the top of the log being milled.        Most are uncomplicated aids that allow a patient sawyer        to make perfectly straight, parallel ripping cuts just        like those made by an honest-to-gosh real lumber mill.      </p>      <p>        As mentioned before in this mini-manual, these milling        attachments can be roughly divided into two categories,        depending on whether the saw mounts <em>horizontally</em>        for "flat" milling, or <em>vertically</em> with the saw        riding atop the log rather than beside it. The horizontal        units are generally larger, more complex and expensive,        and much more efficient for highvolume professional work.        The vertical "mini-mills" are smaller, less complex, and        less expensive, but we wondered just how capable they        could be.      </p>      <p>        So we rounded up the two least-expensive vertical mills        we could find and headed out to THE MOTHER EARTH        NEWS° EcoVillage research center to make some        sawdust. From our battery of chain saws we chose a        midsize Poulan Model 3700 (3.7 cubic inch powerhead) with        an 18" guide bar, because it fell within the size range        (14" to 21" bar) of saws owned by the average        nonprofessional woodcutter. We were working with 8'        lengths of 16"-diameter pine log, freshly cut, green and        sappy (why make it easy on ourselves?).      </p>      <p>        <strong>OF BEAM MACHINES AND LUMBERMAKERS</strong>      </p>      <p>        We decided to evaluate the smallest, least-expensive        mills on the theory that very few folks will ever have        reason or opportunity to run enough logs through a        multi-hundred-dollar horizontal mill toe pay back its        purchase price. But more than a few industrious        MOTHER-readers will build backwoods cabins during their        lifetimes, and even more will have occasion to mill out a        beam or a few boards from time to time. Neither of the        tools tested-the Haddon Lumbermaker and the Bushpilot        Beam Machine-retails for over $50. That means, at least        hypothetically, that milling just a few boards, or even        <em>fewer</em> heavy beams, could pay off either of these        tools in its first day of use.      </p>      <p>        Great. But do they work?      </p>      <p>        The answer is yes, both of them do. But the        <em>sawyer</em> works even harder. Milling lumber this        way isn't a job for the languid. But then, neither is        <em>any</em> sort of work with a chain saw. Coaxing a bar        through the length of a large log-over and over        again-requires strength and stamina. It also demands        patience arid perseverance.      </p>      <p>        But for those who don't mind sweat in their eyes and        sawdust in their hair, here's a run-through of what to        expect on your first day of milling.      </p>      <p>        <strong>HOW MUCH WOOD WOULD</strong> <strong>A WOODCHUCK        CHUCK ...</strong>      </p>            <p>        Although the little Poulan hummed right along and never        bogged down, the day's milling was laborious, as we        attempted to "lumber out" a beefy (and green) 16" log        with an 18" saw. Our chief sawyer estimated that he could        have produced several times the number of beams and        boards that he did, had he been working with 10" to 12"        logs. But then the beams and boards would have been        considerably smaller, of course. So it all comes out in        the wash.      </p>      <p>        For maximum cutting efficiency and minimum effort, your        saw should be in good tune and equipped with a        razor-sharp chain. We found that we could make about two        passes through an 8' length of pine log before the chain        needed to be resharpened-which indi cates that any        potential chain saw lumber miller should have his or her        chainsharpening skills down pat. (Special "skip-tooth"        milling chains are available that offer both longer        intervals between sharpening and increased cutting        speed.)      </p>      <p>        Once you've felled and limbed a tree for milling, you'll        need to roll it up onto two firewood-size sticks of scrap        wood. How high Well, just make sure it's high enough to        keep the tip of your saw', guide bar from contacting the        ground while cutting.      </p>      <p>        After getting the top of the log more or less level by        sawing off any projections, nail a guide board parallel        to the length of the timber and extending about a foot        beyond the far end. (The cutting bar trails the mill, and        without this extra length you'll find yourself        freehandling the last few inches of each cut.) Carefully        align and position the track before nailing it down.      </p>      <p>        Now place the mill atop the guide rail (like a rider        straddling a saddle), start the saw, and begin "rocking"        it through the log. It goes like this: Pull the saw into        the top of the log, allowing it to pivot up to about a        45° angle. Then, while holding the mill so that it        won't backslide, apply pressure to the front handle of        the saw to force the bar down to the vertical. You should        now have a straight up-and-down cut some several inches        long; continue on through the length of the log with the        same rocking motion.      </p>      <p>        After the first half-round "mill end" slab falls to the        ground, shut the saw off and lift it of the guide board.        Use a claw hammer to pry the track loose, and set it        aside. Roll the log over a quarter-turn, reposition and        nail down the guide board, put the saw back onto the        track, and have at it again. (This transition operation        takes only a couple of minutes once you get it down.)        Twice more through the procedure of cutting and        repositioning, and you'll have a beam plus four        half-round mill ends.      </p>      <p>        To mill dimensional lumber from your freshly cut beams,        simple measure the width of the plank you want, nail the        track down, and go to it as before. Although it's        necessary to reposition the track tier      </p>      <p>        each board you mill, the operation goes quickly because        you no longer have to turn the log before each cut.      </p>      <p>        Milling also gets easier as you go along, since you'll be        learning as you go. Our novice millman's first cut took        almost 15 minutes-but by the end of the first day he was        ripping off boards in a third of that time.      </p>      <p>        There's not a whole lot more to it than that. The        instructions that come with your milling attachment will        provide the basics, and the rest is just a matter of        practice. Within a few hours you'll be milling with the        best of them. (And you'll be <em>tired.)</em>      </p>      <p>        Now let's take a look at the two mills under scrutiny.      </p>      <p>        <strong>THE BUSHPILOT BEAM MACHINE</strong>      </p>      <p>        At $29.95, the Canadian-made Bushpilot Beam Machine is        the least expensive chain saw milling attachment on the        market. It would be difficult to imagine anything more        basic-and it works beautifully.      </p>      <p>        This little mill is nothing more than a foot-long section        of 3/16"thick stamped steel U-channel, measuring 1-1/8"        on the sides by 3-5/8" wide. It fits snugly over a 2 X 4        guide board (which, of course, actually measures only        1-1/2" X 3-1/2").      </p>      <p>        A large hexagonal coupler-nut is welded crosswise to the        top of, and 3° from the front of, the U-channel. This        nut accepts a 1/2"diameter bolt that's welded to a heavy        C-clamp made of bent steel bar. The saw's guide bar fits        into the C-clamp and is anchored in place by tightening        two beefy 3/8"-diameter bolts that force the bar against        a serrated steel plate on the opposite side of the clamp.        This arrangement allows the saw to pivot for easier        milling (and the attachment stood up to several hours of        cutting without losing its grip).      </p>      <p>        A feature unique to The Beam Machine is a row of what the        manufacturer calls "dog teeth" spaced across the top and        about an inch from the front of the U-channel. The three        teeth project down and come into contact with the guide        board, digging in to help fight the tendency of the mill        to backslide during the "rocking" cutting motion        described earlier. This feature results in a significant        saving in sawyer energy.      </p>      <p>        The dog teeth work beautifully on a <em>new</em> 2 X 4        guide board; but by the second cut, the teeth have dug        channels into the rail, effectively negating their        ability to bite in and get a grip. Since the teeth have        simply been stamped out of the U-channel material itself,        it seems that the manufacturer could greatly improve the        performance of the product simply by making the teeth a        bit meaner-that is, making them longer and sharper, and        perhaps adding a second row staggered behind the        first-without noticeably driving up his production costs        or the selling price.      </p>      <p>        The Beam Machine comes with instructions, including        photos and drawings, that are adequate but not overly        detailed.      </p>      <p>        The Beam Machine comes with a lifetime guarantee on        materials and workmanship. You can order it from The Beam        Machine, Box 546, Fall City, WA 98024-for $29.95 plus        $4.00 for shipping and handling. Canadian readers can        order the unit from Ted Mather, Box 16, Quathiaski Cove,        B.C., Canada. Or write to either address for more        information.      </p>      <p>        <strong>THE HADDON LUMBERMAKER</strong>      </p>      <p>        The second low-cost ($44.95) chain saw lumber-milling        attachment we tested is the Haddon Lumbermaker. This tool        has been around for several years, and utilizes a        modified U-channel construction stamped from 1/8"-thick        steel. A heavy cast C-clamp holds the saw's guide bar in        place under pressure from three 1/4"-diameter allenhead        screws.      </p>      <p>        The U-channel measures 3/4" on the sides, with a width of        5-9/16" to accept a 2 X 6 guide board ...and includes an        L-shaped steel plate that bolts to the bottom of the        channel to accept a 2 X 4 rail (In fact, it's adjustable        down to about 1-1/2", though we wouldn't recommend using        a guide track that narrow.)      </p>      <p>        This guide-board-width adjustability puts the Haddon a        jump ahead when working with extremely large logs, since        a 2 X 6 rail offers more lateral stability. With logs of        less than 12" diameter, it doesn't seem to matter much        one way or another.      </p>      <p>        But since the Lumbermaker doesn't have any sort of t11        gripping provisions ("dog teeth" or whatnot), it's prone        to backslicing during the milling operation and is thus a        little more tiring t;, work with.      </p>      <p>        The Lumbermaker's 28-page owner's manual is excellent. It        utility lizes clear instructions and sharp photos to lead        the sawyer step b,. step through even the most        complicated chain saw millin operations-including the        basics of building a log cabin with millsquared logs.      </p>      <p>        Haddon's "no-risk" guarantee states that if you're not        completely, satisfied with the tool, you can return it        within 30 days of purchase for a full refund-"No        questions asked."      </p>      <p>        The Haddon Lumbermaker is available by mail order for        $44.9 ; plus $2.00 shipping and handling from Haddon        Tool, 4719 W. Elm St., Dept. ME9, Box 515, McHenry, IL        60050. The company :1, will be happy to send you more        information on request.      </p>      <p>        <strong>TO MILL OR NOT TO MILL,</strong> <strong>THAT IS        THE QUESTION ...</strong>      </p>      <p>        And onlyyou can provide the answer. Either of the milling        attachment ;;.ments discussed here will get the job done.        They're reasonably priced and sturdily constructed. They        can be successfully employed for an% thing from simply        squaring two sides of a log, to making beams, to milling        dimensional lumber. The amount of work involved is not so        much a function of the <em>mill</em> as it is of the size        and condition of your chain saw, the sharpness of your        chain, and the size and varies of trees you're milling.      </p>      <p>        Which mill is better? We can't say. Our limited hands-on        evaluation indicates that each has its strong and weak        points, as noted above: but we weren't aiming for a        "shoot-out" comparison. We'd advise that if you're        interested in milling your own, you write to        <em>both</em> out fits for more information ...and check        out any similar mills that come to your attention.      </p>      <p>        Overall, if you keep your expectations within the obvious        limit tions of these little tools, we feel that a        mini-mill can be a word: while addition to your        toolshed-especially if vou're energetic, economyminded,        and striving for self-sufciency.      </p>

The guide rail should extend beyond the log end. [2] The Lumbermaker uses the setscrews to anchor the saw's guide bar. Tighten the two bottom screws, then ""snug up"" the top screw. The screws tended to loosen during use, necessitating retightening. [3] The Beam Machine uses two setscrews (actually, 3/8""-diameter bolts) to secure the guide bar.
