                <p>      <strong>Homestead Handbook</strong>    </p>          <h5 id="byline">by David Harper</h5>        <p>      It's hunting season again. Time for those who savor the      flavor of venison, elk, and antelope roasts to attempt to      lay in a supply of healthful, low-fat meat for the winter.    </p>    <p>      Each fall hundreds, perhaps thousands, of newly successful      hunters are faced with the problem of how to handle a large      meat animal once it's been reduced to possession. Because      many of these nimrods lack the skills necessary to properly      process their kills, a lot of meat is wasted, and even more      is tainted-giving wild game an undeserved reputation      of being "strong," "gamey," or "wild tasting."    </p>                <p>      So if <em>you</em> plan to head for field or woods this      year as a meat hunter but have no experience in dressing,      transporting, and skinning deer-size animals, read on as      the author shares his 24 years of game-handling experience      with you.    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind, too, that the information that follows isn't      <em>just</em> for antelope, deer, and elk hunters      ...similar techniques can be used to skin and dress midsize      livestock such as goats and sheep, and thus can be valuable      skills for <em>any</em> meat-eating homesteader to master.    </p>    <p>      T he first factor to influence the flavor of an animal's      meat comes into play with the squeeze of a trigger or the      release of an arrow. Was it a clean, fast kill that dropped      the game in its tracks ...or a poor shot that required      several arrows or bullets to finish off the wounded and      terrified beast? In the latter case, expect subtle but      nonetheless detectably unpleasant flavors from the      adrenaline that was pumping through the animal's body those      last few panicked minutes of life. And if a bullet or arrow      penetrated organs other than heart, lungs, or brain, expect      even worse. In short, if a hunter can't be sure of making a      humane, killing shot, then he or she has no right to waste      an animal's life for what may well turn out to be inedible,      or at least inferior, meat.    </p>    <p>      But let's assume you won't take a shot unless you can be      reasonably sure of killing cleanly. What else do you have      to know?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Prehunt Preparation</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before you take to the woods, you'll need to collect the      accoutrements necessary for field-dressing and transporting      a large animal. If you know that you'll be able to haul      your game out the same day it's killed, you can get by with      just a sharp knife, a small whetstone, a plastic bag for      liver and heart (assuming you enjoy such cuts), a foot or      so of heavy string, and a few yards of rope. (If you're      after elk, you'd best carry two knives-one small and      sharp, the other large and sharp-plus a good      sharpening stone.)    </p>    <p>      When hunting in a more remote area where you may be forced      to leave all or part of the meat in the wilds overnight,      you'll need a bit more gear: a cheesecloth game bag to keep      flies from "blowing" (laying eggs in) the meat, and a bone      saw or hacksaw to aid in quartering the carcass for packing      out. And while one strong individual can hoist a deer into      a tree with nothing but a rope, you'll need a small block      and tackle to get an elk of the ground.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Field-Dressing</strong>    </p>    <p>      Always approach a downed animal with caution. (I once had      my shin sliced open by a kick from a "dead" deer.) After      you're certain the animal is down for keeps, unload your      gun and place it out of harm's way. If your state mandates      immediate tagging of big game, do it now. Then, if the      ground slopes, pull the animal around so that its head is      uphill, and roll it over onto its back. (You may have to      prop rocks or logs under its sides to keep it belly-up.)    </p>    <p>      Every experienced hunter knows that the first two things      you do in the field-dressing process are [1] cut the      animal's throat to "bleed it out" and [2] remove the musk      sacs from the hind legs if it's a male. Right?    </p>    <p>      Wrong and wrong.    </p>    <p>      [1] The animal is dead. The heart is no longer pumping. All      you'll accomplish by slitting its throat is to dump a few      ounces of blood onto the hide and mess up some neck meat.    </p>    <p>      [2] Musk glands? The idea is to get rid of them so the foul      liquid they contain won't contaminate the meat. But it's      the rare hunter who can slice and pull those sacs free      without getting some of that same nasty stuff on his or her      hands ...hands which will then contaminate all the meat      they touch while dressing out the animal. I've found it      safer just to avoid touching the musk glands; if you don't      bother them, they won't pollute your meat.    </p>    <p>      What you do want to do as soon as possible after the kill      is to remove the sex organs and open the belly from rectum      to sternum to get at the viscera (internal organs). It's      messy, hard work that requires a sharp knife and an even      sharper eye, plus some energy and patience. But it's not      really <em>difficult</em> . In the next few paragraphs I'll      lay out what I've found to work best under most      circumstances, with most animals. You may read or hear      about another method somewhere else. Fine; there's more      than one way to skin a cat-or a deer, elk, antelope,      sheep, or goat.    </p>    <p>      The first step (Fig. 1) is to seal off the vent so that      feces can't escape. Use a thin-bladed, very sharp knife to      "core" around the anal opening so that you can grasp and      pull it out far enough to tie it of with stout string.    </p>    <p>      Next, make an incision around the sex organs and remove      them (Fig. 2). But to avoid piercing the bladder or      intestines, cut no deeper than necessary; try not to get      into the body cavity.    </p>    <p>      Now comes the major incision. Start just ahead of the      rectum and draw your knife forward, slicing carefully with      the blade rather than "stabbing" in with the tip. When the      opening is several inches long and the intestines begin to      bulge out, insert your free hand and push the entrails down      and away from the abdominal wall. Then turn the knife over      so that the cutting edge is up, and place the blade into      the opening just ahead of your hand (Fig. 3). Cut slowly,      holding the viscera away from the knife to prevent      puncturing the intestines. Stop the cut at the base of the      breastbone (sternum).    </p>    <p>      With that done, locate the bladder, cut it loose, and      attempt to remove it without spilling the contents (Fig.      4). With the pee-sac out, pull the rectum through from the      inside, cutting away any remaining tissue holding it in      place. Roll the animal onto one side, reach into the body      cavity, and cut loose any tissue anchoring the entrails to      the abdominal wall; then roll the carcass over and free up      the other side. Now sever the gullet (esophagus) just ahead      of the stomach, and use both hands to drag the whole works      out onto the ground (Fig. 5). If you wish to save the      liver, allow it to cool, then drop it into the plastic bag      you brought along for that purpose.    </p>    <p>      Good. Now it's time to move up in the world of      field-dressing ...to the chest cavity. Cut through the      diaphragm (a membrane separating the chest from the      abdominal cavity), reach up into the chest as far as you      can, and sever both the gullet and the windpipe (Fig. 6).      Give these two tubes a tug and they should come out with      the heart and lungs. After the heart has cooled, put it in      the bag with the liver.    </p>    <p>      Finally, roll the carcass over onto its stomach to dump the      blood that will have pooled in the body cavity.    </p>    <p>      That's it. Your animal is field-dressed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Out of the Woods ...</strong>    </p>    <p>      A strong person can sling a dressed-out antelope, or even a      small deer, over his or her shoulders and carry it      out-as long as "out" is downhill or fairly level      ...which is one reason behind the old saying "Always hunt      uphill." But, in most situations, you're going to wind      <em>up dragging</em> your kill. (If you ever do carry an      animal, be sure to cover its head with a bright red or      orange cloth-don't take a chance on meeting an      unethical hunter who might shoot at a bobbing pair of      antlers!) Stuff the plastic bag containing heart and liver      into the animal's chest cavity, produce your length of      rope, throw a noose around the base of <em>both</em>      antlers (or around the neck if there are no antlers), and      get on with it.    </p>    <p>      Are you stuck in camp a few days waiting for the rest of      your party to fill their tags before you can get home with      your meat? If so, since rapid and thorough cooling is      important to insure good flavor, it's best to go ahead and      split the breastbone, then prop the body cavity open with      sticks cut to length. Slip the carcass into a cheesecloth      game bag and hang it, head-up for better drainage, on the      north side of a large shade tree, high enough to be out of      the dust and away from four-legged nocturnal visitors. If      you can't cool the heart and liver in an ice chest, it's      best to either eat them right away or toss them out for      scavengers.    </p>    <p>      Though some hunters and even guides prefer skinning an      animal out if it must be kept in camp for a few days, my      experience has been that it's better to leave the hide on      until you get home. What little flavor might be lost as a      result of slower hide-on cooling is more than made up for      by the protection this natural wrapper provides for the      meat, both while it is hanging in camp and while it is      being transported.    </p>    <p>      <strong>...And Home</strong>    </p>    <p>      No single action marks a hunter as inexperienced and      egotistical Lister that) hauling a game animal home      strapped across the hood of a car. After all, few things      can ruin meat faster or more thoroughly than exposing it to      engine heat and high speed airflow (air that's most likely      filled with dust, pollution, and bugs).    </p>    <p>      The only sensible places to haul big game animals are      <em>inside</em> a vehicle, or (covered with tarp) in the      bed of a truck. If you don't own a truck, van, or station      wagon, see if the carcass will fit into the trunk of your      car-or even in the backseat (on a tarp to protect t      the upholstery). If there's absolutely no alternative, wrap      the animal in a heavy waterproof tarp and lash it to the      trunk. That way the meat will at least be out of the brunt      of road wind, have some protection, and be politely hidden      from the eyes of those who really aren ' t impressed by the      sight of large, dead animals. (In some states, it's      actually illegal to trills port a big game animal strapped      on the exterior of a vehicle.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Skinning</strong>    </p>    <p>      Back home, you'll need to rig a gambrel (Fig. 1), which is      nothing more than a rack for hanging an animal by its back      legs. Scrounge up a three-foot length of rebar or other      small-diameter rod or pipe (a sturdy limb will do if      nothing better is available), plus a few feet of rope, and      you're in the gambrel business.    </p>    <p>      Now find a place to hang the animal for skinning. An open      garage or shed is ideal. A basement or other cool, clean      indoor area will also serve the purpose. Hang the carcass      outside, as from a tree or clothesline pole, only as a last      resort.    </p>    <p>      Once you've located a suitable overhead support, position      the gambrel components and the carcass beneath it. Feel      around just below the animal's hocks for the "empty" space      between the cannon bone and the Achilles tendon, and use a      sharp knife to open a slit to each leg just long enough to      run the gambrel rod through. (Be careful not to cut the      tendon, or you'll have nothing to hang the animal by.) Slip      the rod through both legs, spread the legs as far apart as      you can (to facilitate both skinning and cooling), and tie      them to the gambrel so they won't tend to slide toward each      other when you hoist the carcass.    </p>    <p>      Now tie a section of rope from one end of the rod to the      other, just outside the legs, leak ing enough slack to form      an inverted V when you tie the hoisting rope to the center      of this "bridle." Toss the rope over the support, haul the      animal up until its head is clear of the ground, and tie      off the other end of the rope (Fig. 8).    </p>    <p>      Since the hide is no longer needed to protect the meat, the      sooner you peel it off, the tastier your steaks and roasts      will be. (And yes, you have to skin your own game even if      you plan to have it butchered professionally, since most      butchers won't mess with it and most states don't allow      hide-on carcasses to be even <em>brought into</em>      meat-processing plants )    </p>    <p>      Let's get with it, starting with the back legs (Fig. 9).      Using a thin-bladed knife (I prefer an inexpensive      fish-filleting model), cut around the legs just above each      hock (remembering that "above" is now upside down). You'll      know you've cut deep enough when the white of hide turns to      the red of muscle.    </p>    <p>      Now use the tip of the blade to slice down the inside of      both legs; these two cuts should meet at about the point      where the genitals used to be. The next incision was begun      during, the field-dressing operation-that long cut      down the belly from rectum to sternum. now you can extend      that, slicing up the center of the chest to just below the      jaw. (No need to split the breastbone. Let the butcher      worry about it, or do it after the hide's off.)    </p>    <p>      Move to the front (bottom) of the carcass and make the same      cuts on the forelegs that you used for the back. Your final      cut will be around the neck, just below the jaw.    </p>    <p>      Muscles are encased in membranous sacks and separated from      the hide by a few more thin layers of membrane. The trick      to skinning is to peel the hide away from the muscles      without damaging either the skin (assuming you want to save      it for tanning) or the meal ...and that thin membranous      layer is what allows you to do it.    </p>    <p>      Start by grabbing the hide where you cut around one of the      back legs. Pull it out and down, working around the leg as      you go. When you get both hind legs peeled down to the      rump, you're likely to encounter some fat. The best bet      here is to leave the waxy substance attached to the meat;      that way you'll have a buffer in case you slip with the      knife. After the hide's off, you can remove the fat      ...which you'd be wise to do, since fat imparts a gamey,      strong taste to wild meat-just the opposite of the      effect it has on grain-fattened domestic livestock.    </p>    <p>      If you work the fingers of one hand between the hide and      meat while you tug out and down with the other, you should      be able to peel back great swaths at a time once you're      past the legs. But sooner or later (probably sooner), the      hide will get ornery. You'll tug all the harder, and some      of the meat will come of with the skin. Now's the time to      bring the tip of that razor-sharp knife back into action.      Gently slice the meat away from the hide, working the blade      carefully in between the skin and that ever-so-thin muscle      casing.    </p>    <p>      When you reach the shoulders, allow the hide to "hang out"      while you peel the front legs back to meet it.    </p>    <p>      Your last skinning job-and the toughest because the      hide is usually thickest there-is the neck. You'll      probably have to use the knife frequently to help things      along.    </p>    <p>      The reason we didn't sever the head before skinning out the      neck (which, on first appearances, would seem to be the      thing to do) is that antlers (or even ears, if that's all      your animal came equipped with) make good "handles" to grab      when manipulating the carcass while skinning. Cut the head      off <em>after</em> the hide is removed, by slicing down the      spine with your knife and sawing through the bone with a      hacksaw. And since you've got the saw at hand, go ahead and      remove the front legs at or just above the knee joints.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How Long to Age?</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're planning to have a professional do the cutting-up      chores, lower the animal, remove the rear legs at the      hocks, wrap the "naked" carcass in a clean sheet or piece      of cheesecloth, and haul it to the butcher. He can age it      in his meat locker.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if you're doing the butchering yourself,      the aging time will be dictated by the temperature of the      area where the meat is hung. In warm weather, it's best to      go ahead and butcher in the morning of the following day,      then "age" the wrapped meat in the refrigerator for a few      days before freezing. However, if it's cool enough for      frost at night, you can safely let the meat hang for      several days.    </p>    <p>      There can be no argument that wild meat is more healthful      than its "industrialized" commercial counterpart. But what      it <em>tastes</em> like depends almost entirely on the      skill and care exercised in its handling from kill to      table.    </p>    <p>      The things that spoil meat are [1] a shot that doesn't kill      fast and clean, [2] poor handling during field-dressing or      transportation, [3] too little or too much aging (cooling)      time before processing, and [4] sloppy butchering ...which      is meat for another article entirely.    </p>
