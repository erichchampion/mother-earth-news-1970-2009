        	    <p>      Pitch your electric space heater and replace it with      this...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Elizabeth Fern and MOTHER's Staff    </h5>        <p>      The handcrafted space heater pictured here can be used      wherever you've got a full-length, south-facing window or      sliding glass door, and it makes an ideal first solar      project for the family newly awakened to the possibilities      in harnessing the sun's energy. What's more, the solar hot      seat-as its name implies-doubles as a useful      piece of furniture, which makes it of added benefit to      folks who live in cramped quarters or on limited budgets.    </p>        <p>      And just how does the solar hot seat work? Well, simply and      unobtrusively. When it's placed before a large pane of      glass on a sunny day-with its screened side facing      into the room and its lid and back flap opened toward the      sun-24 water-filled milk containers inside capture a      useful amount of solar heat. When the sun sets (or no      longer shines), the trunk can be closed back up to be used      as a sitting stool; then the warmth that's been collecting      in it all day will be released slowly into the living area      through the screened panel.    </p><p><strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong></p>    <p>      Tempted to make a solar hot seat of your own? OK, find a      tape measure ... a handsaw ... a coping saw or jigsaw ... a      protractor ... a pair of tin snips ... a hammer ... a hand      drill with bits ... and a screwdriver. Then scrounge up the      following building supplies: A couple of 37-1/2"-long 2 X      4's ... about 25 linear feet of 1 X 2 pine ... 18 square      feet of 3/4" plywood ... 10 feet of trim molding ...some      foil-faced foam insulation and decorative screening ...a      handful of finishing nails, screws, body washers, and      carpet tacks ...two 3" hinges and two 1-5/8" hinges (with      matching screws) ...a small magnetic latch ...and a lid      support (preferably one with a friction catch). In order to      turn your solar heater into an attractive and comfortable      seat, you'll also need some sturdy fabric, as well as      cushioning foam, for upholstering the lid.    </p>    <p>      Got everything? Then here's a step-by-step list of building      instructions that, together with the illustration, should      guide you through making your solar hot seat.    </p>    <p>      [1] Begin by nailing a 25-1/2" X 37-1/2" plywood base atop      the two (parallel) 2 X 4 runners, using 6d finishing nails.    </p>    <p>      [2] Then build the frame up from this base (as shown in the      diagram), using the cut-to-length 1 X 2 strips and      finishing nails.    </p>    <p>      [3] Next, screw (from the inside) a 16" X 25-1/2" section      of plyboard to each end of the framing to secure the      structure. Use your coping saw to cut out the lower reliefs      if desired.    </p>    <p>      [4] This done, screw (again from the inside) a 5-3/4" X 39"      piece of plywood to the bottom third of the back side of      the box. When that's in place, attach a 10" X 39" plywood      door to the same side, at a point directly above this      stationary panel, using the two small hinges.    </p>    <p>      [5] OK, move to the front of the trunk and cut the      decorative screen to fit this side, af fixing it to the      frame with mitered trim molding and finishing nails.    </p>    <p>      [6] Now, using the large hinges, attach the 27" X 39"      plywood panel to the top of the box to form a lid.    </p>    <p>      [7] Cut the foil-faced foam insulation to fit inside the      lid, the two sides, and the back door (making sure to allow      for the vertical frame support as the illustration shows).      Then use wood screws and body washers to hold these panels      in place on the interior walls.    </p>    <p>      [8] You're almost done! Add the small magnetic latch to the      back door, and the lid support to the top ... and-if      you want to get the maximum use from available      sunlight-paint the wood around the insulation with      reflective silver paint.    </p>    <p>      [9] To finish up your solar project, measure and cut the      material and the foam padding (or whatever else you have on      hand) to fit over the lid. Then cover the padding with the      cloth, securing both with carpet tacks spaced about 4"      apart around the rim. For an added decorative touch, paint,      stain, or upholster the two sides and back of your hot seat      to match the cushioned lid.    </p>    <p>      Now your own solar hot seat is ready for action. Well,      almost. You still have to fill the 24 milk jugs with water      (use food coloring or clothing dye to darken the liquid,      making it even more heat-absorbent) ...cap them (if you've      lost the lids, secure plastic wrap around the rims) ...and      place them in the hot seat. Now, you're <em>really</em>      ready. Just open 'er up and let the sun shine in!    </p>
