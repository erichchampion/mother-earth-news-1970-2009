                    <p>      <strong>Good News for Whales<br /></strong><br />    </p>        <p>      The world's whales are breathing a little easier since the      International Whaling Commission's (IWC) June meeting in      Buenos Aires, Argentina. The 40-nation IWC voted to reduce      the number of whales that could be caught in the 1984-85      season from 10,011 to 6,040. This one third reduction in      annual kills is considered a major victory by nonwhaling      nations and conservationists.    </p>    <p>      Last year the IWC adopted a moratorium on commercial      whaling that will take effect next year. This year, the      nonwhaling nations used the five-day meeting to urge lower      quotas and pressure the whaling countries to reduce the      number of whales taken during the 1984-1985 season.    </p>    <p>      The battle at the meeting centered on the Southern quota.      Japan and the Soviet Union argued that they should be      allowed to take the same number of minks that they took      last year (6,655), even though IWC scientists reported that      the mink whale population has declined precipitously. When      the Seychelles, an island-group nation in the Indian Ocean,      proposed that only 3,887 minks be taken, Japan denounced      the proposal as unacceptable, primarily because such a      quota would make its whaling operations uneconomical. The      Seychelles' proposal failed to muster the necessary      three-quarter majority in the final plenary session (20      yes, 9 no, 7 abstain).    </p>    <p>      At that point, the Japanese expected to move the discussion      off the floor and behind closed doors so they could cut a      deal in a private commissioners' meeting. But the delegates      from the Sevchelles managed to hold the floor and      introduced another proposal, with a slightly higher quota      of 4,224. Japan objected in vain, and the measure was put      to a vote.    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, South Africa switched its vote from no to      abstain; Finland changed from no to yes; and two countries      which felt that the Seychelles' first proposal was      unreasonably low the United Kingdom and      Denmark-switched from abstain to yes. The measure won      the necessary three-quarters majority. The Japanese and      Soviets were stunned, and the conservationists (and, we      trust, the whales) were thrilled.    </p>    <p>      Nations can object to the quota and continue whaling, but      they risk U.S. economic sanctions and international      condemnation if they ignore or repudiate the convention.      The IWC's actions this year set the stage for a dramatic      confrontation at the next meeting, to be held in the gland,      when the morato, is to take effect.    </p>    <p>      Friends of the Earth and others produced a daily news paper      called ECO during the conference. Because the meaning was      held in a Spanish-speaking country (for the it time), each      day's proceedings were summarized in Spanish some of the      articles were translated. For information about how to      obtain the five issue set of ECO, write: David Phillips,      Friends of the Earth, 1045 Sansome St. Francisco, CA      94111.<br />      <br />      <strong>Borneo Burns</strong>    </p>    <p>      In other international it's just come to light that more      than 13,500 square miles of tropical forest East      Kalimantan, a province of Borneo, Indonesia, burned between      February and June of 1983. News of the blaze traveled more      slowly than fire itself, which raised an area three times      the size of Lebanon and equal to two-thirds of the world's      annual forest loss. The cause of the blaze is unknown.    </p>    <p>      Underlying deposits of soft coal and peat kept fires      smoldering for months and reignited the blaze in different      parts of the forest. Ordinarily, moist tropical forests      aren't vulnerable to fires of this size, but a two-year      drought in the Pacific region-a result of shifting ocean      currents-dried out the forest. Logging operations that      littered the forest floor with debris also contributed to      the conflagration. The fire will affect timber harvest      cycles for the next 70 years.<br />      <br />      <strong>Filthy Lucre</strong><br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      "Money may be hazardous to your health." Someday soon that      message may appear on our greenbacks ...right below "In God      We Trust." The reason? The Federal Reserve Bank in San      Francisco has been stopped from disposing of its shredded,      worn out bank notes in public dumps, because high levels of      copper and lead have been found in the bills.    </p>    <p>      The problem surfaced when the Fed's banks in San Francisco      and Los Angeles came up with a new plan to get rid of old      currency and food stamps. The more than four tons per day      of trashed cash and coupons were to be turned into pellets      and sold to the public as mulch. Unfortunately, an      independent testing lab found that the level of toxic      metals in the waste was 1,300 parts per million (pm) in the      discarded dollars and 1,600 in the crumpled coupons.      Federal law limits these concentrations to 1,000 pm. Until      the Fed can figure out what to do, the San Francisco      Chronicle reports that "residue from the San Francisco bank      will go to a hazardous-waste site in Richmond,      California."<br />      <br />      Parties willing to have the material buried in their      backyards (before it's shredded, of course) can no doubt be      found.<br />      <br />      EDITOR'S NOTE: The worldwide organization called Friends of      the Earth is one the most effective environmental groups in      existence today, and the activities of FOE-along with      a broad range of other news concerning ecological      developments are described each month in its publication      titled Not Man Apart.)
