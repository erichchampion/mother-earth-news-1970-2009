                <p>      <strong>The Seasons of the Garden</strong>    </p>    <p>      Now, as the season bestows the fullness of the harvest, the      riches of the garden fill every sink and countertop. Reap      the reward of work well done, and preserve the earth's      bounty for the harsh days to come.    </p>          <h5 id="byline">By Peter Hemingson</h5>        <p>      With personal computers becoming more and more popular,      perhaps it's time to explore one of the lesser-known      sources of gardening information: the agricultural bulletin      boards. These notice-posters are made of electrons rather      than cork, but they serve the same purpose as the more      traditional type found in local supermarkets and other      public places ...the free and open exchange of information.      An example, and one that most home gardeners might want to      get acquainted with, is run by the Indiana Cooperative      Extension Service at Purdue University. Named FACTS, this      bulletin board is available to anyone with a computer, a      modem (a device that enables computers to communicate over      telephone lines), and enough change in his or her jeans to      make a longdistance call to 317/494-6643 in West Lafayette.      Once you're connected and you respond to a query about your      "terminal type" ("other" is generally the correct choice),      you're presented with a menu of possible commands. Select      "R" (for read) and you'll be able to peruse messages that      other bulletin-board users have posted-everything      from lamentations about the performance of the Illinois      football team in the Rose Bowl to comments on the      shortcomings of the telephone service in West Lafayette,      Indiana. Reading the messages can be entertaining, but they      rarely have much to do with farming or gardening. For those      topics, you'll need to choose option "N," for news.      Instantly, up comes the menu: There's a list of crops      newsletters (which contain such items as grain price      forecasts, farmers' evaluations of the corn program, and an      emergency notification of the Environmental Protection      Agency's suspension of the insecticide EDB) ...and a list      of horticultural newsletters (even more up our alley,      covering such topics as keeping flowers fresh, applying      wood ash in the garden, planning a rose bed, pruning      ornamental trees, planning your landscape, and starting      seeds indoors). The real treasure trove, though, is titled      FXMENU and is composed of agricultural computer programs      that are available through the county extension offices to      all of the residents of Indiana, as well as to anyone else      with a computer that can emulate a VT-100 or VT-52      terminal. In this section you'll find such goodies as a      home garden planner (the same one that Northrop King has      licensed for commercial use) of considerable sophistication      ...a home insulation analysis program. . . calculations      that figure the cost of anything from credit to children's      clothing ...and even a sample budget for a retired couple.      Of course, there are more traditional agricultural      programs, too: pork or beef carcass performance evaluation,      for example, or a ration analyzer for dairy farms. The      astonishing thing is that these programs, while copyrighted      by Purdue, are available-to anyone who calls the      bulletin board-for the price of a phone call ...which      after 11:00 PM can be remarkably small.    </p>    <p>      Then again, though FACTS may be the most accessible      computer bulletin board, it's certainly not the only source      of electronic information for farmers and gardeners.      Nebraska has AGNET, a membership system with a $50 annual      fee and connect and computer-use charges that can amount to      an average of $30 an hour during business hours. Of course,      a computer can do a lot of work in an hour ...and charges      are lower during off-hours. AGNET offers such consumer      programs as Beefbuy (which compares alternative methods of      buying beef ) ...Carcost (which calculates the cost of      owning and operating a car or light truck) ...Firewood (an      economic analysis of alternatives available with wood heat)      ...and Foodpreserve (which calculates the cost of      preserving foods at home, both by canning and freezing).      Information about the system is available from AGNET,      University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583-0713, or by      calling 402/472-1892.    </p>    <p>      Up in Michigan, you'll find TelPlan, a membership system      operated by the Michigan State Cooperative Extension      Service. Information is available from TelPlan,      Agricultural Economics, Agriculture Hall, East Lansing, MI      48824.    </p>    <p>      And in Virginia, you can join CMN-Computer Market      Network-a subscriber setup sponsored by the      Cooperative Extension at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. To      contact CMN, write to Virginia Tech, Attn: CMN, Plaza I,      Building D, Blacksburg, VA 24067. The cost of computerizing      isn't all that great these days, either. If you purchase a      less-than$750 Atari or Commodore 64 setup, for example, you      can access the bulletin boards ...store the information you      download ...and print it out at your convenience.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE GARDENER'S</strong> <strong>BOOKSHELF</strong>    </p>    <p>      Western gardeners may already be aware of two paperbacks      from H.P. Books that recently came my way; both are worth a      long look. Ken Smith's <em>Western Home Landscaping</em>      ($7.95) covers landscape design, garden structures, and      plant materials in HP's typically exhaustive manner ...and      with an equally characteristic profusion of color photos.      And <em>Western Fruit, Berries, & Nuts: How to Select,      Grow and Enjoy</em> (by Lance Walheim and Robert L.      Stebbins, $7.95) applies the same formula to the incredible      variety of fruit crops available to gardeners in the Golden      West. If anything could make a New Englander envious, it's      the color photo that illustrates the 11 cultivars of sweet      oranges, 3 sour oranges, 3 blood oranges, 12 mandarins, 3      tangelos, 3 lemons, 4 limes, and 2 grapefruits that can      grow in western gardens ...not to mention such exotica as      pomelos, tangors, and kumquat hybrids with names like      "citrangequat," "limequat," and "orangequat." Both HP      volumes are warmly recommended.<br />    </p>
