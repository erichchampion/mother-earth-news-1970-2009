                <p>      <em>Protect your sensitive electronic equipment from      lightning damage by building your own ...</em>    </p>          <h5 id="byline">By TJ Byers</h5>          <p>      "Snap, crackle, pop" may be familiar breakfast sounds to      some people, but for many others, such noises signal      disaster ...lightning disaster.    </p>    <p>      Each year, the damage done by lightning runs into the      millions of dollars, and the human casualties number in the      thousands. As a matter of fact, more people are killed each      year by this form of electric discharge than by all other      natural disasters combined.    </p>    <p>      Lightning wreaks the most <em>financial</em> havoc,      however, when it damages electronic equipment. Stereos,      televisions, and home computers succumb to the effects of      this force daily. And the most perplexing part of the      problem is that lightning doesn't even have to strike an      appliance directly to inflict damage. Flashes many miles      away can turn hundreds or thousands of dollars' worth of      circuitry into high-tech junk.    </p>    <p>      <strong>VOLTAGE SURGES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The problem comes from the utility-fed electricity used to      run your equipment. The power delivered to your home has      probably traveled through hundreds of miles of wire and      several substations before it reaches you.    </p>    <p>      When lightning strikes, it does so with the force of      millions of volts. You can actually hear lightning      discharge several miles away (and I don't mean the thunder)      if you listen to an AM radio during a thunderstorm. The      highvoltage discharge generates radio waves that are picked      up by your radio's antenna.    </p>    <p>      In a similar fashion, the sprawling utility grid can pick      up static from lightning. When a strike comes close to a      power line, the wires act as a large antenna and absorb      part of the energy. A power surge as high as 2,500 volts      can be injected into the grid in this manner. These voltage      surges travel down the wires into your home and right into      appliances, where they can destroy sensitive electronic      parts ...even though the equipment is turned off.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, you can protect your costly possessions from      this threat without having to unplug them every time the      sky clouds over. There is an electronic device called a      metaloxide varistor (MOV for short) that can serve as a      watchdog on the voltage of your AC line.    </p>    <p>      As long as your household voltage remains within normal      limits, the MOV does nothing. Let the voltage suddenly      surge to 130 or higher, though, and the MOV swings into      action. What it does is absorb the extra voltage created by      the spike and dissipate it as heat. When the line voltage      returns to normal, the MOV goes back on standby. The entire      sequence happens in about onemillionth of a second.    </p>    <p>      Metal-oxide varistors are inexpensive and usually are      readily available (see the sidebar for access information).      The amount of protection you need, however, will depend on      the type of equipment you have. Television sets are more      sensitive than radios, and computers are extremely      vulnerable. Therefore, I'm providing you with three types      of MOV systems to choose from, according to the degree of      protection you need.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOOD</strong>    </p>    <p>      The simplest protective device requires no construction at      all on your part. It consists of a single "MOVed" plug that      is inserted into an outlet and has the appliance cord      plugged into it. This product, which is solo' by Radio      Shack under the name Voltage Spike Protector (part number      61-2790), contains a single MOV device connected across the      hot and the neutral power lines. Any transient exceeding      130 volts is readily suppressed by the MOV and is thus      prevented from . r, tering the equipment.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, this simple device doe protect against      <em>all</em> forms of power surge. 1; the lightning strike      is such that voltage spike, of equal proportions are      induced in <em>both</em> the hot and neutral wires, the MOV      won't sent the change    </p>    <p>      <strong>BETTER</strong>    </p>    <p>      To remedy this shortcoming, I've \e con structed a surge      protector that contains three MOV devices. One is wired      across the ho and neutral lines, just as is the case with      the Voltage Spike Protector. To keep the spike that are      common to both lines from creeping into the system, though,      I've added two other MOV's-one from each line to the ground      wire. With this arrangement, the output <em>t ol:</em> age      can never be more than 130 volts iii direction.    </p>    <p>      You can duplicate this surge protect a matter of minutes,      once you've collected t t proper parts and tools. First,      you'll need ,; sixoutlet expansion plug. Radio Shack',      61-2622 is one example. Remove the card board back from the      outlet by unscrewing the four coarsely threaded rivets on      the back w the device.    </p>    <p>      When you have the back cover off, your, faced with six      copper strips that are used to expand a two-outlet socket      into a six-outlri one. If you have the misfortune, as I      did, o: having the metal strips tumble into hands as you      remove the cardboard, don't panic. Simply shove them back      into their slots with your thumb.    </p>    <p>      The next step is to solder the MOV devices into place.      There's plenty of room inside the plastic housing to      accommodate them. Using the "better" model in the photo as      your guide, slip the <em>MOV's</em> into position. Now clip      the wire leads. to length, and solder the MOV's to their      respective copper strips. One <em>MOV</em> goes across the      thin prongs, another connects between one thin prong and      the ground connection (the strip with the round insert),      and the third is soldered between the remaining prong and      the ground. Don't worry about which direction they're wired      in; just be sure that no leads are touching that might      short the circuit.    </p>    <p>      Replace the cardboard backing, remove the wall plate from      the wall socket you intend to use, and plug in your new      outlet protector. Fasten the adapter in place with the long      center screw that's provided, and you're finished. Any      appliance that's plugged into this outlet is automatically      protected from all forms of voltage surge.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEST</strong>    </p>    <p>      Even the protection offered by the threeMOV outlet is      insufficient in some cases. A personal computer, for      example, not only is allergic to voltage spikes but is also      sensitive to "noise" on the AC line.    </p>    <p>      Noise can best be described as unwanted voltage excursions      that are under the activation threshold of the MOV      protector. In other words, they are small signals that ride      on top of the standard power voltage. They aren't      particularly harmful in most cases, but they can scramble      the data contained in a computer's memory chips. Words may      come out "mizpeled," and, in some cases, information is      lost altogether.    </p>    <p>      How does this noise get on the line to begin with? It's put      there by other electrical equipment. Refrigerators, air      conditioners, vacuum cleaners, and television sets all      generate electrical pulses that find their way into your      electrical system. In fact, your computer's      <em>printer</em> may be the worst offender. A big reason      for this is that the printer and the computer often share      the same outlet, so the noise has an easy path into the      machine's memory.    </p>    <p>      To remove unwanted noise from an AC line, you need a      filter-which brings us to the third design. In addition to      being MOVprotected, the "best" option incorporates an      effective filter. The entire project can be built inside a      Radio Shack Plug-in Power Strip (part number 61-2620),      though similar units are available from most electronics      and hard ware stores. These power strips feature a      heavy-duty cord that expands to four outlets housed in a      sturdy metal case. As an added feature, the power strips      come equipped with a built-in 15-amp circuit breaker.    </p>    <p>      To modify one of the devices, you must first split the      aluminum housing in half by removing eight screws, four in      each of the two end plates. However, this is easier said      than done. For some reason, the screws have recessed,      square-drive heads that require a special tool. I didn't      consider the tool to be worth buying, so-after several      false starts-I devised a way to get the screws loose. By      filing slots in the fasteners' heads with a triangular      file, I was able to remove them with an ordinary slotted      screwdriver. After I finally did get the screws out, I      promptly tossed them away (I replaced them with      conventional Phillips-head items).    </p>    <p>      Once the end plates have been removed, the lower half of      the metal case slides off, exposing the undersides of the      outlets. Begin the modification by removing a short strip      of insulation from each of the three wires connecting the      first two sockets together (looking at it from the      circuit-breaker end). A razor knife works best. Now solder      three <em>MOV</em> devices to these wires, bridging one      across the black and white wires, one across the black and      green, and one across the white and green. After soldering,      bend the leads so the <em>MOV's</em> rest against the backs      of the outlets, as shown in the photograph.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        The Run on MOV's      </h3>      <p>        <em>Recently there's been</em> another        <em>surge ...in the demand for MO V's. As        a result, there's a shortage of devices        on the market this summer (1984). At        the time of this writing, Radio Shack is        completely sold out. However, the        warehouse has assured me that the        situation will be resolved by the time        you read this article.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>In the event that your local Radio        Shack dealer has trouble keeping        MOV's on the shelf, the devices can        be purchased from many sources.        Most television repair shops will have        some on hand; they're marketed by        RCA (stock number SKMV130F) and        Sylvania (stock number ECG2V130)        as general-purpose replacement        parts. If your neighborhood shop        doesn't carry them, the proprietor        should be able to order the devices for        you.</em>      </p>    </div>    <p>      Next, work on the link that connects outlets two and three.      With a pair of wire cutters, completely remove a section of      the black and white wires between the two outlets, leaving      short pigtails connected to the second socket. Strip the      insulation from the pigtails. Do NOT cut the green wire!    </p>    <p>      This last operation divides the four outlets into two      pairs. In the severed line, you'll insert a filter to      remove noise from the last two outlets. But before you can      do that, you have to cut a small piece of insulation from      the three wires that join sockets three and four, just as      you did when installing the <em>MOV's.</em>    </p>    <p>      After stripping the wires between three and four, solder an      RF choke between the black pigtail on socket two and the      freshly exposed black wire between three and four. Then do      the same for the white wires. Finally, connect a 0.047      microfarad capacitor across the green and black wires and a      second 0.047 microfarad capacitor across the green and      white leads, laying the capacitors out of the way after      installation.    </p>    <p>      After inspecting your work for shorts, reassemble the case.      Then plug the cord into a convenient outlet, and you're      ready to go. When using the power strip for a computer,      plug the printer into outlets one or two and the computer      itself into three or four.    </p>    <p>      And there you have it: three different degrees of      protection from snaps, crackles, and pops. Remember,      though, that none of these devices is a lightning      <em>arrester.</em> In the rare instance when lightning      actually strikes your house, damage will ultimately result.      For everyday voltage transients, however, surge protectors      are an effective, inexpensive form of insurance.    </p>
