And the      proliferation of machines that employ moving air to      generate electricity can largely be attributed to two      pieces of federal legislation, both of which resulted from      the recognition of our nation's energy predicament back in      the 1970's. These two important incentives can actually      turn a wind system that costs as much as $3,000 per      kilowatt of capacity into a wise financial investment.    </p>		<p>		<strong>YOU, THE FRIENDLY</strong> <strong>LOCAL    UTILITY</strong>		</p>    <p>      In 1978 Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory      Policies Act (PURPA), which contains a provision, Section      210, that-among other things-specifies that      utilities must buy power from (and sell power to)      independent producers of electricity who utilize renewable      sources of energy. Under PURPA, an owner of a wind machine      is guaranteed a connection with his or her local utility.    </p>    <p>      The wind systems of a couple of generations ago had battery      banks to store their excess production. These plants were      designed to be electrically independent, simply because      there was no centralized source of power in the form of a      utility grid. Admittedly, windplants of the 20's and early      30's were far better than the alternatives: motor      generators or no electricity at all. But when the wind      stopped blowing for extended periods, their battery banks      did eventually go flat. And, until the wind came up again,      the residents either had to fire up a backup generator or      go without electricity.    </p>    <p>      Today the utility grid can offer a windmachine owner an      essentially unlimited source of backup power. And the      utility's interconnection charge-which the system      owner must bear-is far less than the cost of buying      and maintaining a battery bank.    </p>    <p>      Hooking into the grid provides another important benefit,      in the form of a constant customer for excess electrical      production. Since a wind machine's capacity will sometimes      be greater than the amount of power that's needed (in the      middle of a windy night, for example), it's very convenient      to have someone around to purchase the excess.    </p>    <p>      PURPA requires utilities to buy electricity from qualifying      independent producers at rates based on what is called      avoided cost. This figure is determined by what it would      cost the utility to produce that electricity. Because      there's a tremendous variation in the actual avoided costs      of different power companies, and because there are a      number of different ways to go about calculating them,      buy-back rates vary from about 1 cents per kilowatt-hour      (kwh) in some midwestern states to as much as 10 cents per      kwh in California and parts of the Northeast.    </p>    <p>      However, regardless of your location, you'll never get rich      by selling power from your home-size wind machine to a      utility. Because the power company pays less than retail      for power it buys, your best bet is to use as much of your      home-generated electricity as possible. Unfortunately, some      utilities require that all generated power be sold directly      to them (at buy-back rates, of course) and that all power      consumed at the site be purchased from the utility at      retail rates. This provision-which is often called      parallel (as opposed to series) interconnection-can      make tying into the utility's grid a financial bust!    </p>    <p>      <strong>TAX INCENTIVES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Because of a variety of federal and state tax incentives,      it's possible to write of as much as 90% of the initial      cost of a wind-powered electric system. One of the      decisions you'll have to make, however, is whether you'll      consider your windplant to be a home appliance or a piece      of business equipment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Domestic applications:</strong> The federal      residential renewable-energy tax credit allows an      individual to deduct up to 40% of the first $10,000 spent      on a wind machine. This will result in a direct reduction      in the amount of tax paid in the year that the equipment is      purchased.    </p>    <p>      In addition, 19 states offer similar direct tax credits,      and a total of 37 states have some sort of direct or      indirect incentive. The indirect incentives may be in the      form of tax deduc tions (from gross income), exemption from      sales and/or property tax, and/or a combination of rebates      or refunds to the purchaser.    </p>    <p>      Finally, an individual may deduct the interest paid on a      loan used to buy a windplant, as well as any sales tax that      may have been added to the purchase price.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Business applications:</strong> There's a federal      15% renewable-energy tax credit for businesses that install      wind machines to serve their enterprises' electrical needs.      In addition, if enough of the power produced from a      residential system goes to the utility grid, the owner may      be considered to be in the <em>business</em> of producing      electricity. This can be ticklish for small systems      connected in series, but all parallel connected systems      should qualify as power-producing businesses.    </p>    <p>      The federal government also provides a 10% investment tax      credit. This can trim yet another 10% off the taxes paid by      a business. And the Internal Revenue Service allows wind      systems to be depreciated over a five-year period (under      Accelerated Cost Recovery), which means that a percentage      of the machine's cost can be deducted from business income      <em>each</em> year over a five-year period.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ENERGY FUTURE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Researchers think that the cost of electricity will      continue to rise at a rate of 15 to 30% annually, once the      current leveling in cost has passed. They also suggest that      another major energy crisis can be expected in the 1990's.      Thus, the development of wind energy, wherever it's      practical, is vital to both our personal and national      well-being.    </p>    <p>      At present, the tax and utility interconnection incentives      are crucial to the feasibility of wind-energy systems.      Unfortunately, the renewable-energy tax credit is due to      expire in 1985. And, as of this writing, a renewal bill has      failed to make its way through Congress. If you'd like to      develop your own wind system in the next few years, you may      want to contact your representatives and senators and urge      them to support a continuation of these incentives.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Readers who are interested in developing      wind systems for far less than the going commercial rate      may want to build their own small DC plants by using plans      developed by Marshall Price. These machines can produce DC      power to be used independently from the utility; or, with      the proper synchronous inverter, the electricity can be      tempered and sold to the power company. The plans are      available for $15-plus $1.00 shipping and      handling-from Mother's Plans, P.0. Box A, East Flat      Rock, NC 28726.    </p>
