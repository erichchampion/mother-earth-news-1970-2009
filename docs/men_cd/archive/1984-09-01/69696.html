                <p>      You can use old jeans, sewing scraps, and a little      imagination to create...    </p>				<h5 id="byline">By Jody M. Wright</h5>        <p>      Would you like to make a unique toy for your children or a      gift for someone special? Something that will appeal to      toddler or teenager ...that's inexpensive and personal      ...and that will challenge your resourcefulness and      creativity? If so, gather the following materials and      stitch up a <em>dinosaur!</em>    </p>        <h3>YOU'LL NEED</h3>    <p>      [1] <strong>Discarded Jeans.</strong> Two pairs of      adult-size denim jeans, faded about the same, so that the      pieces will match when they are put together and one pair      of children's jeans, brightly colored, for the mouth and      spikes on the spine.    </p>    <p>      [2] <strong>Felt.</strong> A 4" X 8" piece of black for the      eyes and a 1-1/2" X 6" scrap of pink or red for the tongue.    </p>    <p>      [3] <strong>Thread.</strong> A spool of blue      <em>quilting</em> thread to use when sewing the jeans (it's      stronger than the regular variety), and a spool of black      for the eyes.    </p>    <p>      [4] <strong>Self-adhering fastener</strong> (such as      Velcro). A 9" length of 1-1/2"-wide fastener to attach the      limbs securely to the body. (Perhaps you can recycle some      of this, too-say, from outgrown coats or tennis shoes.)    </p>    <p>      [5] <strong>Stuffing.</strong> Two bags of 16-ounce      polyester fiberfill. Shredded foam is economical but messy.      Or look around the house for such alternatives as old      stockings or leftover pieces of quilt batting.    </p>    <p>      [6] <strong>1/8" foam</strong> . This is to make the spikes      stand up along the spine. (Sometimes this foam is used as      packing material.) As an alternative, you can use some of      whatever material you're using for stuffing.    </p>		<h3>ENLARGE THE PATTERN</h3>		<p>      Rule a 2" grid on a large piece of wrapping or graph paper.      Then, using the diagram provided here, carefully copy the      design-one square at a time-onto the paper to produce a      full-size pattern.    </p>		<h3>CUT IT OUT</h3>    <p>      [1] Prepare the denim material by cutting the jeans open at      the inseam and spreading them flat, with right sides      together. Lay out the pattern pieces to make best use of      the denim, and cut out a total of two front panels, two      side panels, four legs, four arms, and eleven spikes.    </p>		<p>		[2] Cut the Velcro into three 3" strips, and then cut one    of the strips in half to be used on the arms.		</p>    <p>      [3] Cut two eyes and one tongue from the pieces of felt.    </p>    <p>      [4] From the child's jeans, cut the mouth (on the fold) and      eleven spikes.    </p>    <p>      [5] Cut eleven spikes and two eyelids from the foam.    </p>        <h3>PUT IT TOGETHER</h3>    <p>      [1] <strong>Spikes</strong> . Form the spikes by placing      one piece of denim and one piece of colored cloth with      their right sides together, then adding a piece of foam.      With the foam on the bottom, stitch the two curved sides,      clip the curves, and turn right side out. Make eleven of      these.    </p>    <p>      [2] <strong>Eyelids</strong> . Place the right sides of the      denim together with the foam on the bottom side. Stitch      around the circle, clip the curves, and turn right side      out.    </p>    <p>      [3] <strong>Eyes</strong> . Baste around the eyes, gather      by pulling the threads, and stuff.    </p>    <p>      [4] <strong>Body</strong> . With right sides together, sew      one of the front panels to one of the side panels. Stitch      the Velcro in place as indicated on the pattern. Repeat for      the other side.    </p>    <p>      [5] <strong>Spine and front seam</strong> . Alternating      blue denim with contrasting fabric, pin spikes along the      spine, pointing down. Pin the two front/side pieces, right      sides together, around the whole body. Stitch, leaving the      mouth and bottom areas open.    </p>    <p>      [6] <strong>Tongue and mouth</strong> . Attach the tongue      to the mouth. Pin the mouth in the open area on the face,      right sides together, and stitch. Clip curves. Turn the      entire body right side out.    </p>    <p>      [7] <strong>Arms and legs</strong> . Sew the Velcro strips      on the arms and legs as shown on the pattern. Place the      right sides together and stitch. Turn them right side out.    </p>    <p>      [8] <strong>Stuffing</strong> . Stuff the arms, legs, and      body.    </p>    <p>      [9] <strong>Handwork</strong> . Close all open seams.      Attach the arms and legs to the body with the Velcro, then      tack around each limb to conceal the fastener. Turn the raw      edges of the eyelids under and sew them to the face, then      stitch the eyes in place under the eyelids, again turning      under the raw edges.    </p>    <p>      Now, who said dinosaurs are extinct?    </p>    <h3>      Mom's Maverick    </h3>        <p>      One of MOTHER's staffers decided to whip up her own version      of Jody Wright's "Deno, "using materials she had at home.      She discovered she had only one pair <em>of</em> <em>usable      jeans and-since they were women's size      nine-they would certainly not provide enough fabric      for this project. So, she dug around in the scrap bag and      came up with a remnant of duck-type cloth that would blend      with the denim and serve as a contrast.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>By laying out the pattern carefully, the enterprising      seamstress managed to cut two front panels, two legs, two      arms, the eyelids, and eleven spikes out of the jeans. She      then cut the back panels, mouth, two more legs and arms (to      be used next to the body), and the eleven contrasting      spikes from the other material.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A piece</em> of <em>red-and-white-striped fabric formed      the tongue (there was no felt in the house), and two large      brass buttons added eye interest. (She had planned to      embroider the eyes-and would have done so if giving the      animal to a small child-but</em> <em>since her teenaged      daughter had already claimed the dinosaur for her      menagerie, the buttons were a safe enough solution.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Bit</em> <em>s of</em> <em>leftover Velcro were used to      attach the arms and legs. (Though this make-do approach      worked, using the larger strips suggested by the author      would definitely be easier.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The only stuffing on hand was a one-pound bag</em> of      <em>shredded foam, so this was used for the body,      limbs,</em> and <em>spikes. Admittedly, fiberfill and 1/8"      foam would be less messy, but the effect was quite      satisfactory. In fact, our designer decided she liked the      stuffed spikes better than those shaped with the 1/8" foam,      even though hers were probably more trouble to make.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Bringing Deno to life was a fun project, the staff er      concluded, but one that took more time than she'd bargained      for (about six hours all told). Then again, the hours      invested seemed a small enough sacrifice for creating a      companion far a lucky young person!</em>    </p>
