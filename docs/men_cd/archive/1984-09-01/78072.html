                      <h5 id="byline">By Gene L. Gillespie</h5>        <p>      Since I find both the installation and removal of tire      chains a pain, I devised a quickie set of grippers that I      can install or remove in less than a minute as winter      driving conditions change, and which are small enough to      fit in an ammunitions box in my trunk or on the floorboard.      However, I want to caution readers that, although traction      is good with my homemade versions, they don't have all the      gripping power of a regular set of snow chains and,      therefore, don't have as much <em>braking</em> power. This      should be considered if you expect to encounter steep      grades. For normal terrain, however, my quickies will get      you there and back reliably.    </p>    <p>      To make them, weld eight 3/8" single chain links-at      equal distances from one another-on the inside and      outside of a couple of spare tire rims ...after grinding      away all the paint in the areas where the links are to be      attached. Take care not to inhale the fumes while welding,      because the cadmium plating of the galvanized chain is      highly toxic. Then, when you're finished, chip the slag,      and prime and paint the rims as you see fit.    </p>    <p>      Next, install a good set of snow tires, have them balanced,      cut lengths of 1/4" chain, install snap links to connect      them to the rims, and you're ready to face Old Man Winter's      variable moods. To extend the life of your chains, drop the      tire pressure a few pounds to reduce the slapping of the      metal on pavement.    </p>
