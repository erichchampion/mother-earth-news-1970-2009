                <p>      <em>You can expand your truck's versatility with this      inexpensive, homemade, haul-all conversion.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Glenn E. Smith    </h5>                <p>      Most of us would agree that one of the homesteader's first      requirements is a truck, and because of its low cost and      ready availability, the truck of choice seems to be either      the half-ton or three-quarter-ton pickup, preferably of the      4' X 8' box size. There are a great many jobs that this      basic vehicle can perform in an admirable manner, such as      hauling hay, grain, fertilizer, firewood, cement, soil, the      shorter lengths of lumber, 4' X 8' sheets of plywood, and      so on. In fact, I'll venture to say that after owning a      pickup for any length of time, most of us have asked      ourselves, "How did I ever live without one?"    </p><p>      Even so,      there are times when the standard pickup box won't do all      the jobs that are required when you're converting raw land      into a livable homestead. It shows its weaknesses, for      instance, when you need to haul 20' lengths of rebar and      PVC pipe, the longer lengths of lumber and corrugated sheet      iron, livestock, or large loads of firewood, brush, or      trash ... or, perhaps, when you wish for a short-stay      camper for hunting and fishing.    </p><p>      There are, of course,      various commercial and homebuilt answers for all such      hauling jobs. For bulk loading or moving livestock, for      example, you need a stake bed, while a lumber rack will      handle the longer pieces of pipe, rebar, board, and the      like. The short-stay camper also can be either commercial      or homebuilt (though it's usually expensive <em>either</em>      way). But if you provide for your needs by using three      separate pieces of equipment, each of the units will      require storage when not in use, not to mention equipment      or extra hands for mounting and dismounting. (If you've      ever had to go out and round up neighbors for chores of      this nature, you know what a pain it can be: Jane had to go      into town for a tractor part ...Bill's gone fishing      ...Bob's on the other side of the hill, cutting timber.)    </p><p>      After giving much thought to the extra jobs I wished my      truck could handle, I decided I needed an arrangement that      could manage bulk and long-length hauling, as well as      serving as a camper. What's more, I felt it was necessary      that one person of normal strength and stature be able to      erect and disassemble each unit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE STAKE BED</strong>    </p>    <p>      I began with the stake bed. Since I expected to leave this      unit mounted on the truck most of the time, I wanted it to      look good. Therefore, I bought the best straight-grained      Douglas fir 2 X 4's that I could find for the stakes, and 1      X 6 vertical-grained Douglas fir for the side boards.      Granted, this is fairly expensive lumber, and you can do      nearly as well at less cost by buying standard boards. But      whichever grade you choose, I'd advise you to go to a      lumberyard that will let you select from kiln-dried stock.      Then check each piece for grain, knots, sap pockets ...and      especially for straightness. (To be sure about the last,      bring the board end to eye level and sight down its length      on the shouldering side.) Reject anything that doesn't      please you.    </p><p>      Both for aesthetic reasons and to provide      corrosion resistance, I'd planned to use brass carriage      bolts and countersunk wood screws to join the side and end      boards to the stakes. But the only place such hardware      could be found was at a marine supply house-in a      distant town and at a prohibitive cost. I ended up      substituting zinc-coated hardware, first primed and then      painted in a subdued yellow color to simulate brass.    </p><p>      For      looks and for easy insertion and removal, I elected to cut      the stake ends in a rectangular pattern to tailor-fit the      existing stake-bed holes, rather than simply to taper the      boards and jam them in.    </p><p>      As you can see in the diagram, the      forward stake on either side has its cuts offset to the      rear by 3/8" to accommodate the 8' sideboard length. These      cuts are easily made with either a table saw or a handsaw.      The side and end boards and stakes can then be sanded and      given three coats of polyurethane varnish (allow six to      eight hours between coats, and sand lightly after each of      the first two has dried) to bring out the wood's natural      color and grain.    </p><p>      To insure the accurate joining of the      stakes and side boards, I inserted the stakes in the bed      holes and C-clamped the side boards to the stakes (with a      suitable cushion between the boards and clamps to prevent      marring). Then I squared, drilled, and joined the boards      with 3/8" X 2-1/2" carriage bolts and flat and lock washers      with nuts, and countersank the wood screws to prevent board      warp. I also decided to mount the side and end boards on      the outside of the stakes, simply because they looked      better that way.    </p><p>      The forward and rear sections were      fabricated in the same manner. The front stakes were cut to      a length that just cleared the top lip of the truck bed;      the rear stakes, to a length that extended 3" below the top      of the raised tailgate. All four sections were then joined      with 3" brass-plated butt hinges at the upper and lower      inside-forward and rear corners. The exception was the      right-rear corner, where one leg of each of the hinges was      attached to the outside of the side boards and the other      leg to the inside of the rear-gate boards, so that the rear      gate swung open on its right-side hinges (a very desirable      feature for bulk loading). In place of the standard hinge      pins, easily removable pins were made of 3/16"      chrome-plated rod, though brass rods would have been even      better. After the forward, side, and end sections were      joined, 1-1/2" X 5-1/2" angle iron pieces (also previously      primed and painted) were applied-purely for aesthetic      reasons-to each end of' the forward and end boards.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE LUMBER RACK</strong>    </p>    <p>      With the basic stake bed completed, I was ready to tackle      the lumber rack. Since assembly and disassembly were to be      one-person operations, the rack would be made in three      separate and independent sections, with the sockets for the      rack legs permanently attached to the stake bed.    </p><p>      I made the      sockets of 1-1/2" thin-wall (.065") square steel tubing      <em>(thin-wall</em> because the major load would be in      compression) and attached them to the 2 X 4 stakes with      1/8" X 1-1/2" X 4" steel strap welded to the square tube by      using 7014 3/32" electric rod at 80 amps. After drilling      holes in the attaching straps, I ground, sandblasted,      painted, and attached the welds to the side stakes with      3/8" X 3" carriage bolts and flat and lock washers with      nuts.    </p><p>      After that was done, three identical rack cross      members were fabricated, using 1-1/4" heavy-wall (.120")      square steel tubing. The legs were welded to the cross      tubes (which were also of 1-1/4" heavy-wall tubing) by      using 7014 1/8" rod at 110 amps. Stops made from 1/8" X 1"      angle iron were then welded to each cross-member leg. One      of the three identical cross members was made to serve as      the independent, over-the-cab front section by welding to      it an additional rectangular section of 1-1/4" square steel      tube (I recommend the thin-wall type, to make handling of      the completed section easier), which, in turn, was      supported by 1/8" X 1-1/4" steel straps welded to the      forward horizontal members and the tops of the forward      vertical legs. When those tasks were completed, all the      welds were ground, sandblasted, and painted as in the      previous operation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE CAMPER</strong>    </p>    <p>      The simple, inexpensive camper completed the project. And      it did indeed turn out to be quite simple and inexpensive.    </p><p>      It was composed of a longitudinal ridgepole held in place      by two sockets screwed to the top boards of the front and      rear stake-bed sections at midpoint. The sockets consisted      of 1-1/2" X 5-3/8" thin-wall square steel tubing welded on      each side to 1/8" X 1-1/2" X 3" angle iron. The ridgepole      was made of 1 1/4" thin-wall steel tubing, with legs of the      same material welded at 90Â° to fit the fore and aft      sockets. A weld bead was applied to the lower inside      corners of the sockets to prevent the pole from slipping      through.    </p><p>      The roof of my camper is a 10' X 12' waterproof      canvas tarp secured to six cargo tie-down rings that I      screwed to the inside rails of the truck bed. I use six      short lengths of rope to tie down the tarp. For a neat      appearance, and to preclude the bother of ropes, snap      fasteners could be used. For a more weatherproof shelter,      canvas sections with sewn-in plastic windows could be      added.    </p><p>      Yet even as pleased as I am with my project, I'm      sure the inventive brains of MOTHER-readers can come up      with no end of modifications and improvements on this      triplethreat, haul-all system!    </p>
