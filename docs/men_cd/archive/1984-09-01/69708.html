                <p>      In their efforts to cope with today's economy, our readers      seem to be in the grip of...    </p>        <p>      Since the first of the year, we've had an almost      overwhelming response to our offer to trade published      barter experiences for one-year subscriptions. Hundreds of      letters have poured in, and since it's impossible to print      even a <em>small</em> portion of them in our usual format,      we thought you might like to have a condensed rundown on      what some of these folks are doing to enrich the quality of      their lives through swapping.    </p>    <p>      If our mail is any indication, New Yorkers seem to be      <em>inveterate</em> swappers. S.S. had a couple of      crocheted tablecloths that had been handed down through her      family. They were just gathering dust until she ran across      someone who owned several handmade quilts and who needed a      covering for a trestle table. Now S.S.'s daughter has a      quilt for her redecorated room, and her new friend has a      table cover ...but best of all, the two families are      sharing beautiful parts of their heritages.    </p>        <p>      Also in New York, M.L.H. had some gallon drums in her yard.      When her garbage-man spotted them and said he could use      them to water his garden, she gladly swapped six of them      for six months of free trash pickup,    </p>    <p>      On the other side of the country, Californian V.J.H.      offered her old vacuum to a sales and service store to use      for parts ... and in return received a six months' supply      of bags for her current cleaner.    </p>    <p>      Still another California resident, M.C.M., bartered a      wallpapering job for hypnotism treatments for her husband,      who was trying to kick his smoking habit. (The treatments      worked!)    </p>    <p>      The I.C. family-also in California-are owners of an organic      nursery and are always open to trades. Their best swap to      date was with a scuba-diving couple: a Christmas lobster      dinner in exchange for materials to make cactus gardens as      presents.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. B.K., a Pennsylvania housewife suffering from "cabin      fever" after the birth of her second child, found a nearby      horse owner willing to trade riding privileges for      occasional baby-sitting ...so he and <em>his</em> wife      could ride together again.    </p>    <p>      During the busy holiday season, a group of C.S.'s friends      in New Jersey engage in yet another good trade: After      making their own specialties in large batches (cookies,      candies, breads, crafts, and the like), they get together      for a swapfest. Everyone goes home with a large variety of      goodies and a happy heart.    </p>        <p>      On a different note, the owner of a tire store, B.B. (who      also lives in New Jersey), says he's always ready to      bargain. He has an ongoing deal with a friend in the      landscaping business: tire repair and replacement-as      needed-on his friend's truck in exchange for spring      plowing and fall fertilizing.    </p>    <p>      Mr. and Mrs. J.L.P. say their two sons are literally worth      their weight (well, at least a <em>portion</em> of their      poundage) in gold and diamonds. You see, their doctor      agreed to accept a pair of diamond earrings and several      gold pendants from their struggling jewelry business in      Colorado as the delivery fees.    </p>    <p>      Another Coloradan, C.K., remembers that when his family had      just moved to Georgia, his father spied a neighbor's      chicken coop made out of roughly hewn walnut boards.      Hastily, his dad offered to construct a new coop from pine      in trade for the valuable walnut ...and then had the lumber      milled so he could build the dining room table and six      chairs that are still being used a generation later.    </p>        <p>      Up in Nova Scotia, K.C. was living near the seashore and      needed a rowboat to pick Irish moss. He wasn't having much      success in finding one, but then he met a lobster fisherman      who was also a boat builder. The aspiring moss gatherer      helped the lobsterman haul in his traps in exchange for      help in <em>building</em> a craft suitable for plying his      trade    </p>    <p>      When business is slow, .Mr. and Mrs. R.M., a Virginia      husband-and-wife paint, contracting team, check the ads in      their local papers for things they need or want. The they      offer to trade their professional services for those items.    </p>    <p>      Iowan D.B. has found a way to plant her garden without any      up-front cash expenditure. Since she's always been very      generous with her surplus produce, when she called on the      recipients of her largess for donations toward supplies,      they were more than willing to help out.    </p>    <p>      Lack of water <em>(and of</em> money to drill a well on      newly acquired Rhode Island property presented a problem      when W.G. and his family wanted to plant a garden and a few      fruit trees in anticipation of the day they'd live there.      The dilemma was resolved when their next-door neighbors      offered to run a water hose from their house to the W.G.      family garden in exchange for a share of the harvest.    </p>        <p>      As a ministerial student, Alabamian R.I. didn't have enough      money to buy all of his books. So when a bookstore opened      nearby, he struck a bargain with the proprietor: For      helping unpack and for doing some simple assembly and      cleanup work, R.I. was given the volumes that are now      important helpmates in his studies.    </p>    <p>      C.E.'s family thought that having electricity and running      water in their Indiana horse barn was an unaffordable dream      ...until they became involved in a three-way barter. You      see, a farmer friend who wanted a horse for his children      didn't have the cash to buy one, and a contractor owed a      large sum of money to the would-be horse owner. For a      substantial reduction of his debt to the farmer, the      contractor put in utility lines to C.E.'s barn. Then C.E.      gave a horse to the farmer Everyone concerned got what he      wanted, and CIE. now has one less mouth to feed.    </p>    <p>      Now, if you've run dry of swapping ideas, this sampling      from our mailbag ought to get your inventiveness flowing      again ...and when you complete <em>your</em> next      successful (and unusual) exchange, tell us about it!    </p>
