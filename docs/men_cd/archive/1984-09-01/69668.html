                <p>      <em>Bring back the smile to a child's face with a napkin, a      "character" voice, and some downright...</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Grian Salomon    </h5>                                                                <p>      There's hardly an adult alive who hasn't, at one time or      another, had to deal with a bored youngster. Occasions      vary: Perhaps the moment came for you in a restaurant when      the child had finished eating and had to sit while others      completed their meals ...or perhaps it was in the waiting      room of a doctor's office or bus station ...or when you      were visiting adult friends. A toddler can become restless      and frustrated at times like these and, being unhappy, can      make life miserable for everyone else as well!    </p>    <p>      Each person must find his or her own best method of      handling such situations, of course. Mine is through hand      puppetry. Does it come as a surprise to learn that puppets      can be practical? Well, I've been teaching preschoolers for      a number of years now, and I have an imaginative      two-year-old daughter of my own. These tots have helped me      discover that puppetry and roleplaying can be enormously      useful-not only in the classroom but also in everyday      situations, where a new puppet can provide distraction and      even help a child see a different point of view.    </p>    <h3>ENTER THE PLAYERS</h3>    <p>      If you'd like to try some practical puppets yourself, here      are directions for a few favorites that have gotten me out      of tight spots with my own two-year-old. I give each      speaking character a particular voice (high, low, soft,      gruff, or whatever) and one or two special interests or      abilities.    </p>    <p>      <em>[1] The Baby</em> can be played with just like any      other doll. To make it, open up a napkin and tie a knot in      one corner. This forms the baby's head. If there's a tail      of cloth above the knot, you can tuck it in or call it the      baby's hair (Fig. 1). Decide which side of the knot looks      most like a face, then fold the corner opposite the baby's      head up behind to form the hood of the infant's bunting      (Fig. 2). Now, with the baby lying flat in front of you,      you'll have a flap of cloth on the left and another on the      right. Choose one of these to be the body, and roll it      loosely toward the center. It provides plumpness for the      bunting to wrap around (Fig. 3). Finally, wrap the      remaining flap-which is now the bunting-all the      way around to the back, leaving the baby's face visible. If      you've used a paper napkin, you can draw features on the      face, using dots or short, curved lines to show whether the      baby is asleep or awake (Figs. 4 and 5).    </p>    <p>      [2] <em>Granny Goose is</em> an easy favorite requiring      only one knot. Hold up your cloth by two adjacent corners      and tie them in a square knot, leaving an opening about two      inches wide (Fig. 6). This should be big enough for you to      insert your thumb and forefinger which, together, make      Granny's bill. Place the knot directly under her "chin"      (Fig. 7) ...and if you like, wrap the lower part of the      cloth around your forearm to make a long, smooth neck (Fig.      8). Granny Goose "talks" when you make little pinching      motions with your fingers. As I see her, she's an expert at      eating, drinking, and doing impressions of other kinds of      birds ...such as <em>Granny Eagle</em> (Fig. 9), which you      make by crooking your index finger down over the end of      your thumb to shape a strong beak.    </p>    <p>      [3] <em>The Snake is</em> playful and enjoys peeking out      from inside a pocket or from behind the salt and pepper      shakers. It whispers when it speaks, which tends to have a      calming effect on the proceedings. To make it, lay the      napkin on a table and roll two diagonally opposite corners      toward the center (Fig. 10). Tuck one protruding corner      back inside between the two rolls, far enough to form an      upper and lower jaw (Fig. 11). Tie a knot to form the head      and to anchor the jaws in place (Fig. 12).    </p>    <p>      [4] <em>The Rabbit</em> has a mischievous quality that's      endearing. Begin this puppet by holding up two adjacent      corners to form the ears. Place them together and grasp the      napkin around the middle (Fig. 13). Tie a knot at the base      of the ears to make the head, leaving long ears for an      adult rabbit or short ones for a youngster (Fig. 14). Leave      the knot just loose enough so that you can thrust your      index finger up inside to manipulate the head, then hide      your hand behind the cloth folds that are the rabbit's body      (Fig. 15). Sometimes the folds fall just right for the      rabbit to grasp a small object, like a pen ...or a child's      hand.    </p>    <h3>TAKE A BOW</h3>    <p>      The beauty of these puppets lies in their simplicity. They      can appear anywhere, at any time, and they're easy to      relate to. Furthermore, children can master them easily and      seem to enjoy sharing them with one another, imagining      encounters and exploits.    </p>    <p>      And, of course, fantasy is akin to enchantment. As you play      with hand puppets, you begin to see everyday items through      new eyes, as stage props and the very stuff of adventure.      Your imagination is stimulated ...and when your waiter      approaches, you might find yourself saying, "More napkins,      please!"    </p>
