                <p>      <em>It's not a toy, but that doesn't mean you can't have      fun with this homemade "plinker. "</em>    </p>              <p>      Here's a riddle for you: What's black and white and blew      all over? You'll never guess in a million years, so we'll      tell you: the darts from an honest-to-gosh homemade blowgun      ...one that even a big spender would have trouble sinking      more than two or three dollars into!    </p>    <p>      Yep, that's right, no longer is the blowgun the bane of      Amazon explorers. It's now graduated to the other extreme,      the realm of high-tech-with coated, thin-walled alloy      barrels, modern plastic-and-steel darts, and even specially      designed mouthpieces. And make no mistake: This new breed      of diaphragm-powered dart launchers has evolved beyond the      casual toy stage and into the bailiwick of the serious      enthusiast.    </p>    <p>      The trouble is, fancy blowguns sell for $25 or $30, which      might be fine for a serious fan, but it's a bit steep for      the uninitiated ...and that's precisely why we developed      this kitchen-table-tech version.    </p>    <p>      Our blowgun's barrel is made from a length of 1/2"      electrical conduit, and the mouthpiece is the dust boot      from a Volkswagen "beetle" ball joint. The darts are simply      drywall nails or stubs of spring wire, fastened to      polyethylene cones fashioned out of discarded plastic milk      jugs. Yet, elementary as it is, our cheapo homemade model      can hold a 6" pattern at 20 yards and come close to      penetrating 1/2" plywood!    </p>    <p>      If you're game for giving it a try, get yourself a 6'      length of 1/2" electrical metallic tubing; a worm-drive,      fuel-line-size hose clamp; a tricycle handgrip; some      friction or handle-bar tape; a VW ball-joint dust boot (any      rubber boot of a similar size and shape would work); an      assortment of grooved-shank and box nails or stiff wire      rods (half the fun is experimenting to see which dart      points suit your needs best); several plastic milk jugs;      and a tube of silicone sealant or some modeling clay.    </p>    <p>      In the way of tools, you'll need a hacksaw, a plumb bob, a      file, a propane torch, scissors or a knife, wire cutters, a      hammer, a minia ture screwdriver, and a block of soft wood.    </p>    <p>      Begin by cutting the tube to a length of 3-1/2' to 5' . The      shorter the barrel, the easier it'll be to wield the gun      ...but you'll be trading of power and accuracy. Next, saw a      piece about 4" long from your scrap. To make this into an      adjustable handle, merely contour one end so it'll make a      clean joint with the barrel, then cut kerfs into the tube      about 1/4" below the high sides of the contour. Pass the      hose clamp through these slots and around the barrel, then      slip the tricycle grip onto the stub. After you've painted      the surface of the conduit, tighten the handle at a      position that allows your arm to be outstretched but bent      slightly when you aim the weapon. Finish up by wrapping      fore and aft of the grip with tape. The rubber mouthpiece      can then be sealed to the barrel with silicone.    </p>    <p>      To make the darts, all you have to do is lay one of the      empty milk jugs on its side, and with the propane torch set      at a low flame, carefully heat an area about the size of a      quarter until the plastic turns clear. Then push the      pointed end of the plumb bob into the soft spot and hold it      there until the dimpled area clouds. Make several rows of      cones in this manner (leaving a bit of room between each),      and cut the dimpled wall from the jug.    </p>    <p>      You can use a short piece of scrap tubing to separate the      cones from the rest of the sheet. Just bevel one end of the      conduit to a sharp edge, then place the plastic-points      up-on your wooden block. Center the tubular cutter over      each cone to be removed, and give the back of the tube a      smart rap with the hammer.    </p>    <p>      Once you've freed a number of cones, it's easy to make      darts out of them by pushing nails or wire stubs through      the pointed ends from the inside. A dab of silicone sealant      or clay set behind the metal will serve the threefold      purpose of securing the point, sealing it, and giving the      dart some necessary weight. A bit of research will help you      to determine which combination of points and putty works      best-though we're partial to drywall nails backed with      silicone.    </p>    <p>      Using the blowgun properly is merely a matter of setting a      dart in the mouthpiece end, placing the rubber cup around      your mouth, and <em>huffing</em> sharply with your      diaphragm. <em>(Don't</em> draw in your breath or you'll      risk swallowing the projectile!) Remember, above all, that      even though your completed blowgun can be a heck of a lot      of fun, it's definitely <em>not</em> a child's toy. Used      improperly, it can be a dangerous weapon. So always      exercise plenty of caution and common sense during play or      practice, and you'll enjoy your "loose change" investment      for quite some time.    </p>
