        <p><em>This particular spud's not meant for eatin' ... though it certainly peels nearly as well.</em></p><p>If you're contemplating any kind of cordwood or log construction, you'll eventually be faced with the knotty problem of debarking your timber ...and using a tool illsuited to the task can reap you a world of frustration-smack at the start of your project!</p><p>Now, we've made a log spud or two here at MOTHER, and to be truthful, some couldn't peel the skin off a grape ...but Eco-Village staffer Rick Compton knocked one together some time ago (in preparation for erecting our log woodcrafts shop) that made the job at hand seem almost <em>easy.</em> It's similar in design to a bark peeler detailed in a book by R.D. Arcand entitled <em>Log Building Tools & How to Make Them</em> (currently out of print but possibly available through a reference library), but Compton's version is somewhat easier to make than that one and, we suspect, functions just as well.</p><p>The tool's built a bit on the heavy side to handle both pine and thicker-skinned logs, and consists of nothing more than a section of big-car or pickup-truck leaf spring ...a hunk of 1-1/4" Schedule 40 pipe ...an old shovel handle ...and a 20d spike.</p><p>If you want to try your hand at making this model, first cut an 8"-long piece of heavy spring with a torch, then heat one end of the blade bar to a dull red. While it's cooling, hammer the tip to a taper so the edges splay out, then set the bar aside to let it give up its heat to the air. <em>Don't</em> quench it in water.</p><p>Next, locate a 6" length of 1-1/4" black iron pipe, and drill a 1/4" hole through it about an inch from one end. With that done, temporarily slip your shovel handle into the socket, lay the cooled bar on top of a sample log, and place the neck of the tool alongside the leaf, gripping the handle at its end with your arm straight down at your side to establish a comfortable working height. Have someone mark the side of the pipe so you'll know at which angle to cut it and then do precisely that, leaving a small shoulder for the rear of the bar to butt against. (If you prefer to skin your timbers on short V-notched logs, remember to adjust the joint angle accordingly.)</p><p>Finally, weld the neck to the bar, drive the handle into the socket, and-after drilling a small pilot hole-lock the handle in place by hammering a 1-3/4" length of the spike through the bore and peening it over. Sharpen the tool's business end by wet-grinding it.</p><p>With a long shovel handle, the spud's actually <em>comfortable</em> to use. If you want a more positive grip and don't mind stooping a little, consider using a D-grip handle, such as one from a spade. In either case, the slight curvature in the spring will let you "rock" over knots ...and with the husky leaf, it'll seem like you're always <em>debarking up</em> the right tree!</p>
