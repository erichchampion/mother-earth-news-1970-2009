                <p>      <em>Here's the eighth in our series about friends and foes      in your garden.</em>    </p>        <p>      Part VIII: The Helpful Tachinid Fly</p>      <h5 id="byline">By Ron West    </h5>        <p>      Let me start this off by admitting that, for the most part,      flies have earned their bad reputations. Most could even be      said to <em>deserve</em> ending up beneath the old      flyswatter. After all, flies include all manner of      bothersome buzzers, from annoying houseflies and crop      tasting fruit fly larvae to welt-raising horseflies and      disease-carrying mosquitoes. Nonetheless, among the various      fly families there really is one clan that is remarkably      helpful to humankind ...and most especially to gardeners.      No kidding! This two-winged boon to the soil tiller is      called the caterpillar, or <em>tachinid,</em> fly (family      Tachinidae).    </p>    <p>      Actually, it's the tachinid's <em>larvae</em> -not      the adult flies-that are beneficial to us. You see,      these gray to greenish white "worms" parasitize a wide      variety of foliage-eating insects, such as grasshoppers      ...Japanese beetles ...corn borers ...and many other plant      pests. (Unfortunately, some species of tachinid youngsters      also have a taste for the caterpillars of harmless      multicolored butterflies. But then, no bug's perfect, eh?)    </p>    <p>      Adult tachinids are often mistaken for common houseflies,      since they're about the same size (1/3 to 1/2" long) and      color (gray or brown with pale markings) as their      ne'er-do-well cousins. However, the members of this      caterpillar-killing clan do have one easily distinguishable      characteristic: Their abdomens are covered with tiny      bristles (see photo).    </p>    <p>      <strong>LARVAL APPETITES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Tachinids have a parasitic attack plan with an ingenious      backup system. Usually, the adult female lays her eggs      directly onto a host insect (one egg per customer!). Then,      after the larva hatches, it burrows down into and proceeds      to feed on its victim. However, if a host isn't readily      available to a birthing mother, she may lay her offspring      on pest enticing foliage. That way, when a hungry      (prospective) host drops by for lunch, it will sometimes      ingest a tachinid as part of the entree! Furthermore, the      <em>uneaten eggs</em> will go on to hatch on their own,      producing larvae that will later hitch rides and find their      new "digs" in passing hosts.    </p>    <p>      There are over 1,300 species of tachinid flies in North      America alone, each one having its own favorite "meal      ticket." Still, the end result for all hosts is the same:      Immature insects that have been "infiltrated" by fly larvae      become sluggish and sickly and generally won't mature into      adults; parasitized adults typically become too weak to      mate, and eventually die. (An interesting note about      respiration: In order to obtain oxygen, a tachinid maggot      either attaches the rear part of its body-that      containing its respiratory apparatus-to the tracheal      system of its victim, <em>or</em> it lets its      oxygen-gathering end actually protrude from the host's      body.)    </p>    <p>      After the larva's growth is complete, the tachinid tunnels      out of its host and drops to the ground to pupate. Once      fully mature, tachinid flies feed only on nectar and other      sweet fluids.    </p>    <p>      So the next time you go on a rampage with the flyswatter,      check to make sure your victim isn't a harmless,      <em>helpful,</em> fuzzy-bellied tachinid fly. That      last-minute stay of execution could be as beneficial to you      (and your garden) as it is to the fly that gets away!    </p>
