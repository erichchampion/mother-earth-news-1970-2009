                        <p>      Autumn is here again, or almost, and with it ...apples!      Crisp, juicy, and fragrant, this wonderful fruit lends      itself to dishes without number. Here, for MOTHER's      readers, are two creations adapted from <em>Uprisings, The      Whole Grain Bakers' Book</em> (compiled after the      Cooperative Whole Grain Education Association Conference of      1980). The book is available for $12.95, plus $1.50 for      postage and handling, from Mother's Bookshelf (restricted) , 105      Stoney Mountain Rd., Hendersonville, NC 28791.    </p>    <p>      We baked and taste-tested both of these recipes, using      MOTHER's art and editorial staffs as the eager guinea pigs.      On the basis of our first results, we made a few small      changes in one recipe but left the other intact.    </p>    <h3>PUDIN DE PAN</h3>    <p>      • 5-6 cups of bread chunks (old bread is best)<br />      • 1-1/2 cups of apple juice<br />      • 1/3 cup of oil<br />      • 1/3 cup of honey<br />      • 1/3 cup of molasses (or maple syrup)<br />      • 1/2 cup of chopped dates<br />      • 1 teaspoon of vanilla<br />      • 1 tablespoon of baking powder<br />      • 1 teaspoon of cinnamon    </p>    <p>      Soak the bread with the apple juice in one bowl while, in      another, you blend the oil, honey, molasses, and dates. Add      the honey mixture to the bread, and stir everything well.      Now dribble in the vanilla. Mix the baking powder and      cinnamon together, then add them to the batter. Use two      spoons to stir the mixture thoroughly: It should be fairly      thick and lumpy. Pour the batter into an oiled 9" X 9" pan,      and bake it at 350°F for 30 minutes, until it's firm      but moist. Finally, spoon your confection into dessert cups      and top it with whipped cream or whipped tofu.    </p>    <p>      Our test recipe was a great success, with comments ranging      from "Great!" to a forlorn "I didn't get any!" Our      <em>pudin</em> was made with molasses rather than maple      syrup, and we used some leftover white bread. Obviously,      the sweetener, as well as the type-and-age-of the bread you      use will affect the flavor, moistness, and texture to some      degree. We served our <em>pudin</em> without topping; in      retrospect we feel this was a good decision, as the whole      thing might otherwise have been devoured in large hunks, at      <em>once.</em>    </p>    <h3>APPLE CAKE</h3>    <p>      • 1/2 pound of butter, softened<br />      • 1-1/2 cups plus<br />      • 1 tablespoon of honey<br />      • 5 eggs, beaten<br />      • 3 tablespoons of vanilla<br />      • 1 cup of yogurt (or buttermilk)<br />      • 2-1/2 cups of unbleached flour<br />      • 2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour<br />      • 2 teaspoons of baking powder<br />      • 2 teaspoons of baking soda<br />      • 1 teaspoon of nutmeg<br />      • 4 teaspoons of cinnamon<br />      • 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts<br />      • 3-1/2 cups of chopped apples, mixed types    </p>    <p>      Cream the butter and honey together until smooth. Add the      beaten eggs, vanilla, and yogurt, and stir well. In a      separate (large) bowl, combine the flours, baking powder,      baking soda, and spices. Add the butter/honey mixture, the      chopped walnuts and the apples, and stir everything      together. Pour the batter into two greased 9" round pans,      and bake at 350°F for about 45 minutes, until a knife      inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the pans      from the oven, let the cakes cool, and serve portions with      whipped cream.    </p>    <p>      <em>Uprisings</em> uses only whole wheat flour in its apple      cake recipe and suggests garnishing the top with nuts.      Although our test of this original version turned out well,      most members of MOM's crew preferred the variation we      present here. Every family has its own taste preferences,      though, so we were pleased to see that this recipe lends      itself to creative experimentation.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, in our test of the original recipe, we used      Granny Smith apples, which are crispy, juicy, and rather      tart. To sweeten the cake without adding sugar, we baked      another version, using a mixture of Granny Smith and      Delicious apples-both Red Delicious and Golden-which proved      very satisfactory.    </p>    <p>      Oh, and the comments? Well, how about an enthusiastic      "Ummm, scrumptious!" and "This is really good!" Add to      these remarks the fact that both the apple cake and the      <em>pudin de pan</em> are easy to make, and you'll see why      we feel these are two apple-icious winners.    </p>
