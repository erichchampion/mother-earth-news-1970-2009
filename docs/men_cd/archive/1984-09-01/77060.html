Macintosh</h5>        <p>      A chain saw lumber mill is a mechanical device that      attaches to the saw's guide bar and-with the aid of a guide      board "track" (usually a 2 X 4 or 2 X 6) nailed to the      project log-allows you to make perfectly parallel milling      cuts the entire length of a log. The primary advantage of      using a mill attachment is that you can cut slabs that are      smoother, straighter, and more equal in size than is      possible with freehand ripping.    </p>    <p>      Although there are many brands of chain saw lumber mills on      the market today, there are only two basic types: small      <em>vertical</em> mills, and the more involved      <em>horizontal</em> units. Which type is better for you      depends on your needs. Let's take a look at both.    </p>    <p>      Vertical mills are, for the most part, simpler in      construction, give you more usable guide-bar cutting length      (because they fit closer to the surface of the log), and      are less expensive to purchase. Moreover, vertical mills      are also easier to install on, and remove from, your saw      than are the more complex horizontal devices, which often      require that you drill one or more holes through the bar to      accept attaching bolts.    </p>    <p>      When you're shopping for a vertical mill, be sure to choose      one that allows the saw to pivot up and down while it's in      use, and that can also be locked at any cutting angle. This      feature will allow you to adjust the bar angle so that the      chain does not protrude excessively from the bottom of the      log-thus eliminating the necessity of raising the project      log high off the ground to protect the bar-tip and chain.    </p>    <p>      Another advantage of being able to adjust the cutting angle      of the bar without removing it from the mill is that you      can put more cutters to work at any one time by using the      lowest angle possible (which will be determined by the      thickness of the log). And finally, there is little need to      change bar length when milling different diameter logs if      you have the option of adjusting the cutting angle.    </p>    <p>      Horizontal mills are generally more expensive-sometimes      they're <em>much</em> more expensive-than the vertical      mechanisms. Also, because they travel alongside the log,      they shorten the guide bar's working length by several      inches. (The horizontal mill attachment I use on my Stihl      076AV reduces the working length of the bar by a full      foot!)    </p>    <p>      Of course, there are plenty of <em>advantages</em> to using      a horizontal mill, too. Probably the biggest plus is that      after you've sliced the first half= round slab off the top      of a log, there's no need to remove, reposition, and      reattach the guide board for every single slab you cut-as      you must do with the vertical mills. Instead, just nail the      guide board onto the first flat-milled side of the log, and      then simply adjust    </p>    <p>      the mill's vertical-thickness calibrating device for each      new cut.    </p>    <p>      And for extremely heavy-duty use, horizontal mills may be      purchased equipped with double-ended bars to accept      <em>two</em> powerheads. These same special bars also take      a "helper handle" device with a roller assembly, which      makes the task of pulling a large saw through a hefty log      much easier. And finally, special auxiliary oiler      assemblies are available that mount at the end of the guide      bar and provide the extra lubrication needed to meet the      extreme demands of continuous milling.    </p>    <p>      To summarize, I'd say that the type of attachment you      choosevertical or horizontal-should depend on the      difficulty and frequency of milling you intend to do. If      you'll be slicing up only an occasional softwood log for      craft projects, or maybe squaring a few logs for beams from      time to time, I'd go with one of the pivoting vertical      units ...most of which are available for well under $100.      If, on the other hand, you are planning to square all the      logs and mill all the lumber needed to construct an entire      cabin, you'll almost certainly be better off with a      substantial horizontal attachment (and a hefty powerhead).    </p>    <p>      In either case, if you're planning an extensive milling      expedition into the backcountry, be sure to carry along at      least one extra com <em>plete</em> set of nuts and bolts      for your mill-including the large U-bolts for the      thickness-rail adjustment on the horizontal mills. In order      to prevent damage to your saw's guide bar or the mill      itself, these bolts are generally of "carriage" quality,      designed to break when overtightened or tightened unevenly.    </p>    <p>      In my many years of professional chain saw experience, I've      found that with a combination of the right saw and mill      attachment for the job, chain saw milling can be an      economical, efficient way to producc quality lumber.    </p>    <p>      Harold C. McIntosh who is the author of The Chain Saw Craft      Book, demonstrates the use of a horizontal chain saw      lumber-milling attachment. Notice the guide board nailed to      the top of the project log, and the vertical-thickness      calibrating device that allows for adjustment of slap      thickness without removing, repositioning, and reattaching      the guide board.    </p>
