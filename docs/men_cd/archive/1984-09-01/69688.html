                <p>      <em>Here's the do-it-yourself way of getting a water      well.</em>    </p>            <p>      A lot of people have considered buying a small, portable,      one-person machine and drilling their own water wells. But      before most folks will act on that fantasy, they want to      know the answer to one question: Can I really do it.;    </p>    <p>      <em>MOTHER's talked with, heard from, and read about a      number of individuals who've tried do-it-yourself well      drilling. Some of our friends and staffers have spent days      of their own time cutting earth at their future homesites.      And we've even drilled a few holes ourselves out at our      Eco-Village to see how well the equipment available for the      job works. So we've gotten to the point where we feel      pretty qualified to address that question. And our answer      is ...</em>    </p>    <p>      Maybe. <em>That's right, maybe you can-and, moreover,      should-drill your own water well. Now, we know that's      a wishy-washy answer, but it's not a simple question, and      we'll tell you three big reasons why. But before we do, we      can tell you the one part of the well-drilling decision      that's simple: If you decide to do it, the rig you'll      probably use for the job is the Hydra-Drill sold by      Deep-Rock Manufacturing, 2200 Anderson Rd., Opelika, AL      36802. We've been unable to locate another company      currently offering a similar small, portable rig.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Let's now go to the three questions you need to answer      for yourself before you put out the money for a      do-it-yourself rig.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>[1] Can the machine do it?</strong> Obviously,      a portable rig powered by a three-horsepower, two-cycle      engine isn't going to have the capacity that one of those      monster rotary machines does. In our own experience, the      Hydra-Drill's standard bit does a fine job of punching      through dirt, sand, clay, and soft rock such as mica      schist. When it hits a layer of tough blue quartz, though,      that bit has met its match.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>DeepRock does sell a special coring bit tipped with      tungsten carbide (you can reap it yourself when it gets      worn) for $45 and even a diamond coring bit for $145 for      cutting through hard rock. We've never tried</em> them      ourselves. <em>We've talked with folks who</em> <em>have      used the special bits successfully ...but all admit the      going is pretty slow. As one MOTHER-reader from Ontario      wrote us, "After drilling for four hours in hard granite, I      had penetrated to the amazing depth of one and a half      inches. " (That frustrated fellow subsequently called in a      professional driller who bored his entire well in four      hours!)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>But slow or not, oftentimes it can be done. Orville and      Dot Synoground of Pine Mountain, Georgia, drilled through      35 feet of solid granite with a Hydra-Drill and a diamond      coring bit. They hit the rock layer at 18 feet and kept      drilling-cutting about six inches of granite an      hour-until they broke through. After three solid      weeks of work, Orville and Dot struck water ...at 165      feet.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So in other words, a properly equipped Hydra-Drill</em>      can <em>make it through a lot of fairly rough rock, at      least at slight to moderate depths. But busting through a      lot of tough stuff may or may not be worth the effort.      (Indeed, DeepRock advisers often suggest pulling up your      drill stems and moving to a new spot if you hit a      particularly tough boulder.) Consequently, you would be      well advised to</em> learn all you can <em>about your      area's geology before you invest in a drilling rig. Check      with neighbors about the depth and ground conditions of      their wells. Ask area drillers what's the hardest rock they      go through near your location. Contact the U.S. Geological      Survey for a regional map with information on boring. And      call your local Soil Conservation Service to see what they      can tell you. As our Canadian reader-after learning      the hard way that his property was set over the massive      Laurentian Shield-put it, "If you want to lump into      the well-drilling business, make sure you at least have a      chance of getting your feet wet. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>[2] Can YOU do it?</strong> A lot of first-time      well drillers we learned about</em> created <em>many of      their worst troubles. Some people from the Community</em>      <em>of</em> <em>Eden in Bruceton, Tennessee, got their rig      stuck three different times in their first well! As they      wrote in their paper</em> The VOICE of Eden, <em>"We      recognize that many</em> <em>of</em> <em>our problems are      due to our inexperience .... But our inexperience is not      much different from yours."</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>There are several calamities that can befall the      novice. If you don't keep water circulating constantly      while you're drilling-or use the appropriate chemical      sealing compound when cutting through soft      matter-your hole may collapse and trap all your drill      stems and pipe! If you're not careful to keep a tight grip      on the still-in-the-ground sections when, piece by piece,      you're removing the drill stems, you could drop several      sections of pine</em> <em>and the drill bit down the hole.      It's even hard to tell when you've struck water!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Fortunately, DeepRock's 18 page instruction</em>      <em>manual is superbly informative. Allong</em> <em>with      clearly spelling out basic drilling procedure</em>      <em>,</em> <em>it honestly warns of several common</em>      <em>mistakes and how to avoid-or, after the</em>      <em>fact, correct-them. Likewise, the company</em>      <em>has five toll free lines staffed by people who</em>      <em>will give you all the helpful advice they can.</em>      <em>One of our local friends-who had his fair</em>      <em>share of drilling troubles-readily admited</em>      <em>"They have a lot of integrity. You couldn't</em>      <em>ask for much better service." It seems clear</em>      <em>to us that DeepRock-a company with over</em>      <em>20 years' experience-really tries to help      its</em> <em>customers succeed.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>[3] Is it cheaper?</strong> At current      prices,if you buy all the equipment you need for drilling      and casing one 100 foot well from DeepRock</em> (excluding      any <em>special bits), you</em> <em>have to spend $1,304      ...or $13.04 a</em> <em>foot.</em> <em>However, the gear      for every subsequent 100</em> <em>feet-at the same or      a new well site-costs</em> <em>only $286 ...for</em>      <em>the extra stems and cas</em> <em>ing. (A single      200-foot well, then, would cost</em> <em>$1,590 in      supplies, or $7.95 a foot.) The national</em> <em>average      for professional drilling</em> <em>about $10 to $12 afoot.      Since the rate varies</em> <em>greatly (it's as low as      $3.00 a foot in parts</em> <em>of Florida, about six or      seven bucks in our area,</em> <em>and as high as $42 or $49      in parts of</em> <em>California or Alaska), you'll have to      make</em> <em>price comparisons for yourself.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Remember, though, that all such calculations assume      your labor is free. Drilling takes a good amount of effort      and time. Indeed with the Hydra-Drill, you have to cut the      entire hole twice: once with a "pilot" bit, and the second      time with a 'full-size reamer. And whenever you have to use      a coring</em> <em>bit,</em> <em>you'll be pulling and      resinking all your drill stems every two feet! Also, you'll      end up with a 2"-diameter well ...while a commercial      driller would probably give you a 6" wide hole. This means      you'll have to use a more expensive jet pump, rather than      the more common submersible one. On the other h</em>      <em>and depending on the licensing requirements in your      area, you may be able to recoup much of your outlay by      drilling wells for other</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In sum, we'd say that if you've made</em> <em>sure      drilling conditions are favorable ...if the cost of doing      it yourself is competitive with commercial drilling charges      (or if commercial drillers can't make it onto your      property) ...and if you have the necessary time proper      aptitude for the mechanical tasks involved, you may well      want to drill your own well.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You decide!</em>    </p>
