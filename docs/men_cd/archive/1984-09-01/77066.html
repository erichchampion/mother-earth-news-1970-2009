                <p>      <strong>Mother's Herb Garden</strong>    </p>                        <p>      The flavor of horseradish ( <em>Armoracia rusticana</em> ,      <em>A.</em> <em>lapathifo lia</em> , <em>Cochlearia      armoracia, C. rusticana, Rorippa armoracia, or Radicula      armoracia</em> , depending on which botanical authority you      follow) is enough to bring tears to the eyes ...and so, in      some cases, are its growth habits. The plant-which      attains two feet or so in height and has large, elongated,      serrated, and wavy-edged leaves-is uncommonly prolific. Any      little piece of root left in the ground is capable of      developing rootlets and shoots-which means that gardeners      who harvest the crop in autumn (leaving perhaps some tiny      root tips in the soil) and subsequently till the ground are      likely to find horseradish plants growing everywhere in      their gardens the following spring.    </p>        <p>      Of course, having a lot of horseradish isn't altogether a      bad thing, because-although it's most famous as a      condiment-the big perennial has many uses ...culinary,      medicinal, and even cosmetic. The first spring leaves,      chopped fine and mixed with other salad greens, or boiled      with an assortment of other leafy vegetables, have an      interesting spicy flavor ...too strong by itself but      stimulating when combined with milder greens. The root,      which should always be used raw and freshly grated, has      even been served as an appetizer, dipped in salt! But it's      as a condiment that horse radish is best known, function      ing as the chief ingredient in tangy sauces for fish, meat,      fowl, or vegetables. When served with beets, beef, boiled      chicken, boiled and smoked meats, and shellfish, its zest      is unexcelled. It also improves cocktail sauces, mustard      sauce, and hollandaise.    </p>    <p>      High in vitamin C, the root was used in the past as a cure      for scurvy. When mixed with vinegar, diluted with water,      and sweetened with glycerin, it is said to relieve whooping      cough in children. When used as a syrup or in a vinegar      solution, it promotes perspiration and stimulates the      nervous system, improving digestion and acting as both a      diuretic and a laxative. (Caution should be exercised,      however: Excessive doses can lead to diarrhea or night      sweating.) The root gratings, spread on a cloth and applied      directly to the skin, have also served as a plaster for      sciatica, gout, and various joint aches; in a vinegar      solution, the herb can function as a good liniment. An      infusion of the root in milk is considered by some to be      good for the skin and to restore color to the cheeks, while      the juice, mixed with white vinegar and applied to the      skin, is reputed to remove unwanted freckles.    </p>    <p>      The characteristic pungent odor of horseradish is created      only when the root is broken. The oil is strong and highly      diffusible: One drop can odorize a whole room! When exposed      to air, however, the root changes color and loses strength;      and if boiled, it becomes vapid and inert.    </p>    <p>      Horseradish, which is best planted early for a good fall      crop, needs to be replanted every few years as its quality      deteriorates. Root cuttings, called "thongs," can be 6"-7"      long and may or may not include a bud. Plant them 12"-15"      deep and 12"-18" apart. Harvest the roots in the autumn of      their third year, store them in damp sand or the      refrigerator (where they'll keep very well), andunless      you've planted them well away from the rest of your      garden-hope you've gotten all the pieces out of the ground.    </p>    <p>      Horseradish roots can be purchased at supermarkets or      obtained through most major seed companies.<br />    </p>
