        <p>As the winter breezes blow, don't turn up your thermostat.Instead, seal the air leaks in your house and stop those colddrafts. Stopping outside air from entering the house is an easy wayto reduce your heating and cooling bills and make your home morecomfortable.</p><br /><p><strong>How to find air leaks</strong></p><br /><p><em>You can feel air leaks.</em> On a cold, windy day, you'll beable to feel cold drafts, particularly around doors and windows,but you can also feel cool air in other drafty spots, such as nearelectrical outlets that are in outside walls.</p><br /><p><em>You can see air leaks.</em> If ice is forming on the flooror wall near a door or a window, you've probably got a seriousbreach in the 'envelope' of your house.</p><br /><p>More subtle gaps can be detected other ways. You can have aprofessional evaluation done (often called an energy audit); yourutility company may provide this service. But you can do a simplecheck yourself. On a windy day, close all doors and windowstightly. Turn off all ceiling and vent fans, and be certain yourforced air furnace isn't running (if you have one). Light a stickof incense or a smoke pencil, then move slowly through the house,stopping by potentially drafty spots. Watch where the smoke goesand how quickly it moves. This will give you a good indication ofhow the air is moving in your house. Be careful not to blow thesmoke around as you breathe.</p><br /><p>The DIY evaluation, though, won't necessarily tell you aboutsome other problematic areas, such as plumbing vents that runthrough walls and out through the roof. A<a href="http://www.oikos.com/esb/45/airleakage.html" target="_blank">chart</a>from the <a href="http://www.southface.org/" target="_blank">Southface EnergyInstitute</a> shows that the wall plates, the area where your wallsmeet the foundation, are the largest source of leaks in mosthouses.</p><br /><p><strong>How to seal leaks</strong></p><br /><p>Although air leaks through light switches and electrical outletsin outside walls account for only a small percentage of energyloss, everything adds up. Plus, installing inexpensive pre-cutsheets of insulation around these switches is super easy. Startwith this simple step; you can find them at home improvementstores. Then caulk around leaky windows and door frames.</p><br /><p>Next, climb into the attic. Fill gaps between plumbing vents andwall framing with expanding foam insulation. Caulk aroundelectrical boxes that contain wiring for light fixtures below. Geta pro to insulate around recessed lights that go up into the attic? a mistake in this situation could create a fire hazard. From theattic, caulk joints between walls below and the ceiling.</p><br /><p>If you have a basement or crawl space, finish there. The primaryleaks will be where the concrete foundation meets the woodenframing of the first floor. Caulk along this area even if you don'tsee gaps. Use foam insulation for larger gaps (around pipes that gothrough the wall, etc.).</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.energy.iastate.edu/efficiency/HomeSeries1.pdf" target="_blank">HomeTightening, Insulation and Ventilation</a> from the Iowa EnergyCenter and<a href="http://www.energystar.gov/ia/home_improvement/home_sealing/DIY_COLOR_100_dpi.pdf" target="_blank">A Do-It-Yourself Guide to Energy Star Home Sealing</a> are twodetailed guides to finding air leaks and sealing them.</p><br /><p>Be sure to also read<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/issues/motherearthliving/green_home/Save-Energy-with-Winter-Window-Treatments_733-1.html" target="_blank">Save Energy with Winter Window Treatments</a>,<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Alternative-Energy/2005-12-01/Slash-Heating-Bills.aspx" target="_blank">Slash Your Heating Bills</a> and<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Alternative-Energy/2001-10-01/Save-Energy-and-Money-Now.aspx" target="_blank">Save Energy & Money NOW</a>.</p><br /><p>Do you have other ideas and suggestions for finding or sealingair leaks?
