        November brings with it the start of the holiday season, schoolbreaks and family vacations. Whether you're visiting Grandma Milliein Cheboygan or escaping to the Bahamas, many of us may travel morein the next few months than we do all year. The bad news is thattravel produces a lot of carbon dioxide, the primary culprit inglobal warming. The good news is it's easier than ever to choosemore eco-friendly travel methods and offset the emissions from yourjourneys. Here are several ideas to consider when making travelplans.<br /><br /><b>Bus and Rail</b><br />Staying in the country, your region, state or even city can leave afar smaller footprint that stepping abroad ? the closer you stay tohome, the fewer fossil fuels will be burned. Taking a trip withinthe United States opens up the option of taking a bus or evenriding a train. A tour by train can be a vacation in itself, and isa fun way to enjoy the scenery and get off the main path.<br /><br /><b>Driving</b><br />If you can drive rather than fly, drive a small car with good gasmileage. Also look for rental companies that offer hybrid-electricvehicles. Among these, Enterprise Rent-A-Car recently launched the<a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070606005200&newsLang=en" target="_blank">50 Million Tree Pledge</a> ? committing to   underwrite the planting of 1 million trees a year for 50 years   as part of their environmental stewardship program. If you're   traveling to Los Angeles or Maui, you can even rent a   biodiesel-powered Volkswagen Bug from   <a href="http://www.bio-beetle.com/biodieselrentalcarsfaqs.htm" target="_blank">Bio-Beetle</a>. Cities throughout the U.S.,   Canada and abroad also offer   <a href="http://www.carsharing.net/" target="_blank">car   sharing</a> programs ? simply pay per trip to reserve a vehicle   for a few hours or several days. No matter what the vehicle,   hitch a ride with grandma and your kid brother rather than   taking separate cars. You'll save gas, and are practically   guaranteed to get a good story or two in the deal.<br /><br /><b>Flying</b><br />Airplanes burn the most fuel during lift-off and landing, so book adirect flight to reduce both, and decrease the total distancetraveled along the way. And try to save air travel for when it'sthe best or only option. Whether you're taking a train, plane orautomobile, Web sites such as <a href="http://www.terrapass.com/" target="_blank">TerraPass</a> and<a href="http://www.earthmoment.com/overview/1540" target="_blank">EarthMoment</a> have partnered with airlines, carrentals, passenger railways and hotels so that a portion of yourpurchase price goes to fund carbon offsets ? or you can calculatethe footprint of your trip and purchase offsets directly.<br /><br /><b>Public Transportation</b><br />No matter how you get to your destination, don't forget about thetravel during your stay. Try walking or taking public transitrather than renting a car. Many cities have some form of publictransportation, and the largest ones, such as New York City,Washington D.C., Boston, Seattle and Los Angeles have extensivesystems such that you won't need a rental car. You'll enjoy thelower cost, no parking hassles, less time stuck in congestion and asmarter environmental choice. City transit usually includesconvenient stops at parks, museums and other cultural offerings.Walking is a great way to see communities and discover great nooksand hidden treats.<br /><br /><b>Accomodations</b><br />All that walking warrants a great place to unwind at the end of theday, and you don't want to dash your efforts with eco-indifferentaccommodations. Use sites such as<a href="http://www.environmentallyfriendlyhotels.com/" target="_blank">Environmentally Friendly Hotels</a> to find ratingsand reviews of hotels and their sustainability efforts. During yourstay, request that linens not be changed until you check outinstead of every morning. Also hang towels on the racks, as towelson the floor indicate to housekeeping that they need to bereplaced. Some hotels are determined in their daily cleaning, so ifall else fails keep the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on your door untilthe room needs refreshing.<br /><br /><b>Extras</b><br />Try as you might, a perfect, zero-footprint vacation often isn'tfeasible without a little help. With<a href="http://earthmoment.com/" target="_blank">EarthMoment</a>, you cancalculate your carbon footprint and use your regular shopping tooffset it. Whether you're buying airfare, a gift for mom or musicfor the trip, your purchase will support your choice of renewableenergy, energy efficiency or reforestation (at no extracost).<br /><br />Have a great, green adventure!<br /><br />Do you utilize carbon offsets or have tips for low-impacttraveling?
