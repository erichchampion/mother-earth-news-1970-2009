                    <h5 id="byline">      by SUSAN BENNETT GALLAGHER    </h5>    <p>      <strong>GEOMETRIC QUILT PATTERNS</strong> are those that      use regular geometric elements-squares, rectangles      and triangles-in some consistent overall      organization. In the long history of geometric quilt      designs the individual variations are too numerous to      count. But certain families of patterns can be identified.      For example, the Log Cabin family uses long strips to make      various types of blocks. Courthouse Steps, Windmill Blades      and Pineapples are members of this group.    </p>    <p>      The Apple Pie quilt belongs to a family in which each block      contains a central rotated square. This pattern has some      similarities to the Shoofly Pie pattern of Amish quilters.      Central rotated squares are flanked by triangles and      strips. The corners of the strips are broken down into      little triangles. These tiny triangles are the "flies" that      buzz around each pie.    </p>    <p>      Early quilts were usually done in contrasting prints, most      often in a white and dark-blue calico print. Printed cloth      was a manufactured good, not always easy to get and      certainly not available in the rainbow of shades and      patterns offered in stores today. A bolt or two, bought      once a year, would be used for that year's dresses, shirts,      quilts and curtains.    </p>    <p>      A limit of two colors was not a hardship for pioneer      quilters. Their quilts are as rich and interesting as some      of the later ones, which exploit a wider palette.    </p>    <p>      The quilt stitching for this piece superimposes four      concentric circles over the squares. The circles are one      inch apart. The first circle fits just inside the central      rotated square, and the successive ones cross through the      strips and triangles.    </p>                <p>      From Childhood Dreams: A Book of Crib Quilt Projects, by      Susan Bennett Gallagher, copyright Â© 1989 by Susan      Bennett Gallagher, $12.95 paperback.
