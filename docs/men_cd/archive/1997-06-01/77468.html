                		<h2 id="subtitle">      THE CARE AND FEEDING OF CASE IRON    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by Angela Jenkins    </h5>    <p>      In our grandmother's day, cast iron was the cookware to      own. It was durable, it heated evenly, it never warped, and      it kept its slick, no-stick finish forever with just a      small amount of maintenance. Using the grand old cast iron      cookware can turn out meals that will not only be a source      of pleasure, but will also please the most particular      palate. For all the good things we can say about cast iron,      one problem exists. Cast iron pieces rust if not not taken      care of properly. But with just a few short steps, we can      cover that same rusty skillet with a satiny finish, ready      for the next delicious pan of cornbread. If you purchase a      new cast iron piece, you will need to clean and season it      before you can use it. If you don't season it, the food      will stick. It is that simple. Favorite pieces that have      been in the family for years can benefit from a new      seasoning, too.    </p>    <p>      To season any cast iron item, follow these directions:    </p>        <p>      1. Wash the cast iron piece in hot soapy water to remove      all machine oil and gum from labels. At this stage of      cleaning, soap is safe to use. However, after a piece is      seasoned, don't use soap because it will remove the      seasoning and you will have to start all over again.    </p>    <p>      2. Dry the piece thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      3. Preheat the oven (gas or electric) to 350°F.    </p>    <p>      4. Cover all the surfaces of the piece inside and out      (including the handle) with a film of solid shortening or      salt-free cooking oil. The entire piece should be shiny. Be      generous with this coating, because it will become the      finish on your seasoned cast iron utensils.    </p>    <p>      5. Place the cast iron piece (you can work with more than      one piece at a time) in the hot oven for one hour. After      baking an hour, turn the oven off and let the pieces set      for a minimum of two hours; let them set overnight if      possible.    </p>    <p>      6. The next day, when the pan is completely cooled, remove      it from the oven and place it on a medium-high burner to      heat. The bottom surface of the pan will darken in about      ten minutes. Remember, even the handle heats up on cast      iron cookware. To avoid painful burns, always use hot mitts      or pot holders to move the pan from one surface to another.    </p>    <p>      7. If you are seasoning a brand new piece of cast iron,      repeat steps three through six.    </p>    <p>      8. You can keep your newly seasoned cookware in a condition      even your grandmother would be proud of Continued use of      your iron cookware aids the seasoned finish. When it is      completely seasoned, it will be very dark all over. Simple      daily measures can ensure your cookware remains shiny and      stick-free. Spray the inside surface with no-stick cooking      spray or add a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil before      each use.    </p>    <p>      Care of cast iron cookware is no more difficult than the      care of other cooking utensils. To remove stubborn spots,      pour salt on the spot and scrub with a dish cloth. Discard      the salt and wipe with a dry cloth. You can scrape away      cooked-on crusts with a plastic spatula. Most often pans      can be cleaned simply by wiping with a paper towel, but      when it becomes necessary to scrub a pan, such as after      cooking a soup or stew, be quick. Use boiling hot water and      a good sturdy brush. No soap. Remember that rust is the      enemy. Wash quickly and dry completely. Set your cast iron      piece in a warm oven or on a warm burner for speed drying.    </p>    <p>      After months of use, food may begin to stick. If this      happens, it's time to repeat the seasoning process to keep      that satiny, no-stick finish. As insurance, each time you      use a cast iron piece, clean it, and drop about a      tablespoon of unsalted vegetable oil in the pan and spread      over the entire surface with a paper towel. Store it with      the shine from the oil still visible. In times past, when      grandma's skillet had a sheen that you could see yourself      in, she cooked lots of fat-laden foods, such as bacon.      These foods left a little of the fat on the skillet      surface. The heat made that fat part of the seasoned      finish. Since most of us are steering away from fat-laden      foods, we must compensate by adding a little oil or      shortening to the skillet each time we use it.    </p>    <p>      Cornbread is one of the most memorable recipes ever cooked      in an iron skillet.    </p>    <h3>Delicious Home-Style Cornbread</h3>    <p>      <em>1 cup self-rising flour<br />      1 cup self-rising yellow cornmeal<br />      1/8 cup sugar<br />      1/4 cup cooking oil<br /></em> <em>1 cup milk</em>      <em><br />      1 large egg</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven and skillet to 425°. Grease skillet      measuring 8" square or 9" round by adding one tablespoon of      cooking oil. Mix all ingredients together and pour into hot      skillet. Bake at 425° for twenty to twenty-five minutes      or until golden brown. A rich golden crust will form on the      edges of the cornbread. Serve hot.    </p>    <p>      For health conscious cooks, the following variation may be      used.    </p>    <p>      1 cup self-rising flour<br />      <em>1 cup self-rising yellow cornmeal<br />      1/8 cup molasses or honey<br />      1/8 cup canola or olive oil<br /></em> <em>1 cup skimmed      milk</em><br />      1 egg    </p>    <p>      Follow above baking directions.    </p>
