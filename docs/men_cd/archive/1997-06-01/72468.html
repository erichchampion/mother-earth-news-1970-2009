                <p>      <strong>BACK TO THE LAND</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Jean Vernon    </h5>    <p>      <strong><em>A veteran real-estate expert smoothes the wrinkles of      land ownership. By Jean Vernon</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      The joys of living in the country are too numerous to      mention, and the thrill of buying your first (or tenth)      piece of land is unlike any other satisfaction in the      world. In the many years I have been addressing the      concerns of rural landowners, it has become clear to me      that country landowners are even more interested in their      real estate affairs than their urban counterparts. Unlike      city dwellers, however, they have far too little      information available to them, information which could not      only make buying and selling vastly easier, but could go a      long way toward solving any potential problems or disputes      with neighbors. I can't begin to number the instances in      which a problem easily avoided grew so troublesome that      ultimately the expense of an attorney was necessary.    </p>    <p>      For instance: When buying or selling real estate how much      of your situation should you tell your agent? What about      buying with a partner? There are many considerations to      co-ownership, and some work in the beginning will go far      into the future, helping insure a successful relationship.      Should you buy land with an easement over it, or a parcel      that is served by an easement? Much trouble arises from      easements but often they are a fact of country life and the      problems must be dealt with in order to enjoy your land.      Did you know that land ownership doesn't always include all      of the rights to that land? How can you determine which      rights you have or are buying? Often land is bought or sold      on a real estate contract. What do you do when things go      awry? What should you do with your deed?    </p>    <p>      I am a real estate broker who deals exclusively with      country land. I am also co-owner, with my husband, of a      ranch and timber tree farm. There are just about as many      questions regarding land ownership as there are landowners,      and knowing what to do about a given situation can be      difficult to determine. It' s our hope that we can begin a      dialogue within this column, so keep your questions coming.      The answers will be of great interest to others dealing      with similar problems, as well as to yourself.    </p>    <p>      <em>There is a driveway easement through my land that      serves another parcel. The recent purchasers of that parcel      treat the easement as if it were their own deeded land,      using it for parking, storage, etc., and are careless with      their litter while crossing my land. Now they are talking      about changing the location of the easement road. Do I have      to let them? What can be done about this problem?</em>    </p>    <p>      Easements are one of the major causes of contention and      hard feelings between rural neighbors, mostly through      misunderstanding the nature of the beast. It is interesting      to note that easement users often believe they have more      rights to the easement land than the actual owner of the      land. Some easement users sincerely believe they own the      easement land outright. However, in reality there is little      basis for this belief.    </p>    <p>      Easements run with the land. That is, when land is sold the      easement is not extinguished; the right to use it goes to      the new owner. The easement does not transfer ownership to      the land over which it passes, nor does it give the      easement user any rights to the land within the easement      other than what is spelled out in the language of the      easement. Most driveway easements provide for ingress and      egress (the right to enter and exit), sometimes include a      maintenance agreement, and sometimes also provide for the      installation and maintenance of utilities. Unless actually      written into the easement description, rights of long term      parking and storage are not included. The landowner      burdened with the easement (you) retains ownership of the      land within the easement and pays taxes on it. You have the      right to utilize that land in any way so long as it does      not interfere with the described use of the easement, in      this case ingress and egress. You may have livestock on it      and install necessary gates. Those gates cannot lock the      easement user out and in most areas must serve a purpose,      otherwise they are considered a nuisance. Easements usually      have a specified width and the driveway may meander      anywhere within the boundaries of the easement. The      easement user may maintain the road but may not move the      road onto any other part of your land, nor may the user      utilize any more land than is necessary for his purposes no      matter how wide the easement description is. You have the      right to all production from the land within the      easement-crops, for example.    </p>    <p>      Read a copy of your easement to determine what rights were      granted with it. If you have otherwise friendly relations      with the new neighbors it might be appropriate to have a      chat with them about the problem to keep the situation from      escalating into a conflict. If your new neighbors won't      listen to reason regarding their use (abuse) of the      easement you may want to take a copy of the easement to      your attorney (real estate expert, please). Sometimes a      letter from your attorney will be all that is necessary to      clear up any misunderstanding, but if legal action must be      taken you will definitely need his or her advice and help.    </p>    <p>      <em>When I bought one quarter of a quarter section I      presumed that I was getting a full 40 acres measuring 1,320      feet on a side. Now I find that my land is just shy of      being a full 40 acres. How can that happen?</em>    </p>    <p>      Although the original government survey in much of the      midwestern and western states established sections that      measure one mile per side, in reality it is not unusual to      find sections and their subdivided parts that measure      something slightly different. Many factors affect the      actual size of parcels that are legally described by the      government survey method. The most common of these are: a      past survey error, mining patents or other land claims that      were established before the original government survey took      place, or corrections for the curvature of the earth. You      have not been cheated. You have received a full quarter of      the quarter section in which you bought your land, even      though your section may not have perfect measurements.    </p>    <p>      <em>My friend who is also looking for land has</em>      <em>suggested we buy land together and the idea</em>      <em>really appeals to me. Can you offer any advice</em>      <em>regarding this type</em> of <em>purchase?</em>    </p>    <p>      The idea of buying land together is very appealing for      several reasons. Usually the more acres you buy the less      you will pay per acre. Two together can often buy much more      land than if each bought separately. It is also often      efficient to pool labor and development costs on a shared      piece of land. There are several important factors to      consider before taking such a step, how ever, and you would      be wise to consider them carefully.    </p>    <p>      If you are single purchasers, what will happen in the event      that either or both of you marry? If you use your resources      to build one home, what will the other partner live in?      What will happen in the case of a divorce? If a partner      dies, who will inherit, children or the partner? What if      one partner has to contend with a severe illness and needs      the investment back? Will the the other partner be able to      cash his or her equity out and assume the payments, or      would the burden be too great? Would both partners then      have to sell out? Can new partners be added at a later      date? Partners may be in agreement with respect to their      ideas when starting out together, but memories sometimes      inadvertently skew those understandings. as years go by. To      be provable, real estate agreements should be in writing      (and that is the easiest way to avoid a lapse of memory      anyway).    </p>    <p>      Weigh every possiblity, no matter how remote, before making      your purchase. It would be best to draw up an actual      partnership agreement. Once you decide on the main points,      it would be wise to consult with an attorney, particularly      concerning inheritance, as that will affect how you take      ownership of the land.    </p>    <p>      One possibility is to consider dividing the land between      the partners at the time of purchase, provided the purchase      terms will allow this. That way, even though the land is      managed in common, each partner is responsible for his or      her own portion. No one knows what the future will bring      and if a partner needs cash the one parcel can be sold      without affecting the other partner' s investment. If the      land is divided it may be easier to borrow against it for      building purposes, and if one partner gets into financial      difficulties only his or her portion of land will be      jeopardized.    </p>    <p>      Such a division is more easily imagined than made, however,      as usually no piece of land can be divided into portions      with exactly equal amenities, no matter how large the      parcel. When viewing land for sale with a partner you must      pay particular attention to the location and rate of      delivery of the water source(s). Will it serve more than      one owner?    </p>    <p>      Good luck with your future purchase. When you provide for      each eventuality before it occurs you are ensuring a future      that holds much satisfaction in owning/work ing with a      partner.    </p>    <p>      <em>We are getting ready to ,ell our older home and heard      there might be a new law that may affect us concerning the      paint in older houses. If so, could you explain it?</em>    </p>    <p>      There is indeed a new law regarding disclosure of      lead-based paint in almost all residential units built      before 1978. To protect people, particularly children, from      the hazards of exposure to lead-based paint found in older      homes Congress passed the Residential Lead-based Paint      Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. The new law was phased in      last year and became effective t effective with private      homes and rentals on December 6th, 1996.    </p>    <p>      With few exceptions, sellers, landlords, and their agents      must provide information concerning lead-based paint to a      buyer or renter before any transaction closes. The      information is provided via a pamphlet developed by the      government, and any information regarding lead-based paint      in the home and/or testing done on the property must also      be provided. Lease agreements and sales contracts must      include certain disclosure and notification language      concerning lead-based paint in homes built before 1978.    </p>    <p>      Testing by the seller or lessor is not mandatory, but      buyers and lessees will get a 10 day period in order to      test the premises at their expense if they desire to do so.    </p>    <p>      There are a few exemptions from this disclosure law,      including short-term rentals of less than 100 days,      foreclosures, units without a bedroom, and housing for the      elderly (unless children live there). All others must      comply whether or not a realty agent handles the sale.    </p>    <p>      This is an overview of the new law. For detailed      information and copies of the pamphlet call 1-800-424-LEAD.      Your realty agent will also have copies of the pamphlet      available if and when you list your property.    </p>    <p>      <em>Many years ago my parents and seven of their children      bought some land on a real estate contract. Now it is time      to commercially thin the timber. A substantial profit will      be made, but we are having difficulty deciding how to split      the profit. Here's why:</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Almost immediately one brother quit</em> <em>paying oil      the</em> <em>contract and agrees he is not entitletled to      profit even though he is still on the title. My dad passed      away; later another brother quit paying and a sister not      originally involved has been paying his share. One sister      got divorced and stopped paying, she has now remarried her      former husband and they want a full share of the profits.      Two brothers failed to keep records of their payments and      mother always made up the difference if anyone didn't      pa</em> <em>y their full share. This has already caused      some angry words and is holding up the logging operation      until we resolve this. Have you any advice for us?</em>    </p>    <p>      Whew! What a mess. This is a classic case of things going      awry between partners. Even with families and close      friends, memories and perceptions can change through the      years, with each person having a different picture in mind.      Some suggestions:    </p>    <p>      Log prices can change at any time and if you were quoted a      good price for your timber it might be prudent to allow the      logging operation to commence while you are working this      out. It could be a few weeks before your first check comes      in, giving you time to resolve this.    </p>    <p>      If profits do come in before a solution is reached it might      be helpful to place the money in a separate account,      perhaps a trust account. Your two brothers will then have      time to research their bank accounts and make a record of      their payments. Before your sister and brother-in-law      receive their full share the family may want to subtract an      amount equal to the payments they missed. You may want to      credit a partial share to the sister who made up payments      for a brother even though she isn't on title. Yours is a      community property state and your mother will probably be      entitled to both her own and your father' s share unless a      will stated otherwise. Your mother should try her best to      reconstruct her payment record for herself and others. The      brother who quit paying at the beginning can quitclaim his      share back to the family or to the person who made up the      bulk of his payments.    </p>    <p>      Emotions run high under this kind of stress and perhaps      these suggestions will help you resolve the problem to      everyone's satisfaction. Don't allow it to cause a      permanent rift in the family.    </p>    <p>      Even though little attention was given to written      agreements in the beginning, it is not too late to start.      Draw up a formal agreement and have everyone sign and      notarize it. Be sure to include contingencies for      inheritance, divorce, missed payments (if still      applicable), and anything else you can think of that may      affect ownership. Ail attorney may have suggestions      regarding this type of document. Once signed it wouldn't      hurt to record this document in the public record. In the      future, note down any agreements that are reached between      two or more family members with regard to this land (you      should always record formal agreements). Years from now      such notes and records will help clarify what each person      wants and has a right to expect. This will go far in      keeping family relationships on a good footing.    </p>    <p>      <em>Let</em> <em>MOTHER</em> <em>solve your problems before      they become headaches.
