Advances in medicine for the most part have projected our      nation farther into exceptional health care than most      peoples will ever know. Yet, are these advances converged      on the fixable part to the extent that they are      discompassionate and lifeless to the individual (person and      animal)? Imbalances of general health and lack of common      compassion and common sense have the same negative and      disquieting effects on our companion animals as they do us.      It is more imperative than ever that we find methods of      wellness, prevention, and care that have broader      perspectives for us and our animals. MOTHER strives to      communicate this urgency with an understanding that healing      for the least among us (through oftentimes simple methods)      will lead to the health of the entire individual and a      betterment of the community. I hope you continue to join us      in this concern with your questions and letters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our Jersey cows have a disease known as laminitis.      What can we do to prevent it? These cows are housed      outdoors mostly. Their lameness was noticed first a few      months ago when the ground got softer.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Will Davis<br />      New Ulm, MN</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>An Ithaca Jersy Recceives some TLC from Dr.      Looney.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Much of the modern dairy cow's difficulty with hoof      disorders is directly related to abnormal hoof growth      caused by laminitis. Inflammation and disruption of the      lamina (the part of the foot that suspends the bones in the      hoof) results in unusually unrestricted hoof growth most      often detected as elongated toes, rings in the hoof wall,      and overgrown outside hoof walls. Since the hind legs      support more weight than the front legs, the outside rear      claws and the inside (medial) front claws bear a majority      of the problem in lame cows.    </p>    <p>      Laminitis is an inflammation of the suspending laminae, the      tissue that holds the hoof on the foot. There are two      forms, acute and chronic. The acute form is very painful      and all four feet may be affected to the point that the      animal doesn't stand or move. First-calf heifers are most      severely affected. Common factors that contribute to the      development of laminitis include acute or chronic rumen      acidosis or endotoxemia (rapid or high concentrate change      in feed), foot trauma such as concrete confinement,      improper claw trimming or overgrowth, poor conformation,      and continued exposure to moisture and acids in manure and      urine. Some nutritional deficiencies and some viral      infections (BVD) may cause laminitis as well.    </p>    <p>      The chronic form of laminitis is more prevalent. Cows with      this form of disease have pancake-shaped feet, very dished      and overgrown. The abnormal shape forces cows to bear      weight abnormally leading to joint and ligament disorders.      The wall-sole junction at the white line often separates      and hemorrhages (black spots) appear. These often progress      into ascending infections and resultant sole ulcers. The      long toes cause cattle to rock back on their heels and heel      erosions develop.    </p>    <p>      Dietary management (decreasing concentrate), environmental      modification (providing some dryness), and diligent claw      trimming (biannually) may help reduce the incidence of      laminitis, although the former is probably most important.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What are the best worm-control methods? Our team of      Belgians is housed in a shed with tie stalls and turned out      daily when they aren't used for work.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Zelma Roberts<br />      Waverly, IA</em>    </p>        <p>      The optimum parasite-control program ensures the horses'      health, while conserving the efficacy or power of the      anthelmintic or dewormer and protecting the environment      where the animals reside. There are several points that      need to be covered to ensure a good parasite-control      program.    </p>    <p>      First, make sure you're using an effective dewormer. Horse      farms can be tested annually for resistance that develops      in commonly used dewormers by doing parasite egg counts      before and after treatment. Turn a sample into your      veterinarian. Second, while it's usually impossible to      weigh horses on a farm, use a girth tape to more accurately      estimate the weight of the animals. Weight is important      because dosages, based on weight, must be as exact as      possible; with the safety of most modern anthelmintics, it      is probably better to slightly overdose than to underdose.      Underdosage selects for resistant strains of worms. You      want to use the minimal EFFECTIVE dose a minimal amount of      times per year.    </p>    <p>      Third, consider different treatment strategies based upon      climate and temperature if the animals are common grazers.      For instance, in the northern United States, where a spring      and summer rise in equine fecal egg counts has been      observed, a spring and summer treatment regimen was just as      effective as year-round treatment recommended by the      manufacturer of certain dewormers. Consider also the      pasture, especially if youngsters graze it. Pasture      sweeping and vacuuming, alternate grazing with cattle or      sheep, or prolonged pasture rotation and harrowing may      really help with environmental control. Rotate anthelmintic      classes annually; this helps reduce the drug resistance      that develops. It's also a good policy to treat new      arrivals to the farm with a nonbenzimidazole drug, the      easiest class of drugs to which worms become resistant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>My thirty-something horse grazes the grass and      clover lawn. Creeping Charlie has invaded the yard. The      horse doesn't graze this, but I'd like to get rid of it      using boron. Should I?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Georgiana Srachia<br />      Homewood, IL</em>    </p>    <p>      Creeping Charlie, also known as Ground Ivy, Gill over the      Ground, or Glechoma, is a short-branching plant that      invades many lawns. It has a very short, square stem and      may have a light-lavender tubular flower when in bloom. Due      to a toxic substance in the leaves, it causes a syndrome of      sweating, salivation, and difficult breathing in horses      when consumed. Horses usually find it offensive to munch on      and once tasting it, will likely turn away from the      "weed."<br />      Borax is used both as a herbicide and as a soil sterilant      and is toxic to animals if consumed in large doses. Many      herbicides, like borax, may cause a contact dermatitis      around the lips and nose of large animals, as well as      non-specific gastroenteritis and muscle weakness. Toxicity      is supposedly low when the chemicals are applied using      manufacturer's directions, but I suspect it may be a better      idea to provide the animal with some quality hay in another      area of the yard while the weedy area is being treated with      the Borax. Always think of drainage of the Borax-laden      soil.    </p>    <p>      It may also not be a bad idea to supplement with some hay      regardless, as many of the common yard and lawn plants,      even if eaten in small doses may cause some signs of colic      and toxicity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>I recently picked up a barn cat and low and behold,      it came with lice. How do I get rid of these things? Are      they contagious to humans?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jean G. Haaland<br />      El Dorado, KS</em>    </p>    <p>      Pediculosis is infestation with lice. These pests are small      wingless insects that are relatively host specific      (meaning, will generally not infest humans!) and survive      only a few days off their victim animals. Lice are      well-adapted parasites and usually more of a nuisance than      a threat to their hosts. They accumulate under mats of hair      and around the ears and body openings. There are two types      of lice: sucking lice and biting lice.    </p>    <p>      Sucking lice produce a blood loss or anemia and debilitate      the animal. Biting lice generally cause severe itching.    </p>    <p>      Lice infestation is often more prevalent in the winter and      early spring due to the growth of longer, heavier hair      coats and closer contact among animals with the cold and      dampness. Diagnosis is easy-one can usually see these      pests crawling on long hairs. Treatment should involve all      animals associated with the lice-ridden cat. Thick mats and      long hairs should first be clipped away. After a regular      soap and water shampoo, the animals should be soaked or      sprayed thoroughly with a pyrethrin flea spray. Stronger      medications or insecticides are not necessary as these      insects are usually susceptible to common flea shampoos,      sprays, and powders. It is advisable to clean the bedding      and premises even though the lice usually do not live when      they are off the host.    </p>    <p>      <em>Our Border collie has a history of back problems      frequently treated with a cortisone injection. We are      worried about the effect of the steroids on her health and      wonder whether acupuncture would help?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ken Minz<br />      Asheville, NC</em>    </p>    <p>      The classic disc disease seen in our companion animal dogs      is only one syndrome that may manifest itself as "back      pain." Sadly enough, several other diseases such as      meningitis, hip dysplasia, or chronic kidney disease may      also make the animal appear as if it has back pain. Thus, I      would first suggest making sure that none of the above or      other related problems are occurring. If indeed the problem      is truly orthopedic in nature, possibly secondary to      chronic vertebral instability or to strained back      musculature, then acupuncture may indeed help.    </p>    <p>      In mild, lower-back disc disease, back pain is frequently      present and the animals are reluctant to walk upstairs, or      may cry when moving or being picked up. These animals would      benefit from REST, as well as relaxation of their back      muscles through any means-acupuncture, heat, or gentle      massage. In more severe lower-back disc disease, the dog      may show some signs of nerve deficit such as knuckling of      the toes or instability of the hind limbs. Acupuncture may      assist these animals as well, although the effect may not      be as profound.    </p>    <p>      The exact mechanism of action through which acupuncture      works is not yet fully understood. Some researchers believe      that acupuncture may destroy muscle pain and hence,      shortening and stiffness. Acupuncture may activate regrowth      of destroyed nerves if the framework of the nerves itself      is not destroyed. It also decreases local spinal      inflammation and prevents release of toxic substances from      damaged tissues.    </p>    <p>      Acupuncture involves the insertion and stimulation of      needles at specific points in the body. Some practitioners      use electros-timulation or laser treatment at the points      instead of or in addition to needles. Heat can also be      applied to the needles to further increase stimulation.      Treatment intervals vary from once daily to once every two      weeks. Supportive treatment includes rest (even confinement      to allow the muscles to heal), proper diets (+/-laxatives),      and supportive care of urinary and bowel habits if the back      is very injured. Acupuncture results for certain forms of      disc disease are comparable to those of surgery and drug      therapy, without the side effects of chronic steroid usage.    </p>
