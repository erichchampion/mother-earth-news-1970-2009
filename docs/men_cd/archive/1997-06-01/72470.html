                <p>      <strong>HOME REMEDIES</strong>    </p>		    		<p>      Wild medicines and foods.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Christopher Nyerges    </h5>    <p>      <strong>The Oak Tree</strong>    </p>    <p>      Beech or Oak Family (Quercus sps.) (Fagaceae)    </p>        <p>      <strong>OVERALL SHAPE AND SIZE:</strong> Quercus is a large      genus of more than 200 species including deciduous and      evergreen trees and shrubs. A few of our common oaks are      scrub oak, canyon oak, California or coast live oak,      engelman oak, California black oak, interior live oak, and      valley oak.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEAVES:</strong> Among the many varieties, the      leaves which are always arranged alternately vary in shape      from small, hard, oval and toothed, to large, flexible,      almost like a maple leaf.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FLOWERS:</strong> Oaks are monoecious; that is,      they have separate male and female flowers on the same      plant. The inconspicuous female flowers are small and      greenish-brown. They look like small acorns and appear      solitary or in a spike in the leaf axils of the season's      new growth. The female flower is formed in side a cup of      bract-like sepals, which later develop into the acorn's cup      or cap.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FRUIT:</strong> The oak trees are identified by      their fruit, the acorns, which are nuts set in scaly caps.      Acorns mature and fall from the trees during September and      October.    </p>    <h3>Christopher's Acorn Bread</h3>    <p>      Here's the recipe for my favorite acorn bread.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup acorn flour,<br />      3/4 cup whole wheat flour<br />      3/4 cup carob flour,<br />      3 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. sea salt<br />      3 Tbs. honey, 1 egg, 1 cup raw milk, 3 Tbs. oil.</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix well and bake in greased pan for about 45 minutes (or      longer) at 250Â°F    </p>    <h3>BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES</h3>    <p>      <strong>EDIBILITY:</strong> Acorns are not eaten raw      because the presence of tannin makes them very bitter. A      number of methods have been devised to rid the acorns of      this bitterness. A common practice of the Southern      California Indians was to bury the acorns in a swamp and      return the following year. This removed the tannin and      blackened the acorns. Sometimes shelled acorns were wrapped      in a cloth container (like a burlap bag) and submerged in a      river overnight. The flowing water would leach the      water-soluble tannin from the acorns by morning.    </p>    <p>      Some would shell and grind the raw acorns into meal. Then      this meal was put into a shallow depression tamped into a      river's shady edge. Hot and cold water were poured over the      meal for most of the day, washing the tannin out into the      sand. The resultant acorn mush would then be carefully      scooped from the sand and either dried or eaten as-is.    </p>    <p>      Another method for removing the bitterness involved the use      of a primitive "leaching plant." It was a bowl made of      twigs or pine needles, supported about two feet off the      ground by vertical stakes. Cloth or burlap was placed over      the bowl, and the ground acorns put in. Water was poured      into the acorn meal and allowed to filter through. The      leaching time depended on the bitterness of the acorns, but      a few hours were usually sufficient. The final product      would then be boiled into a mush, and was usually eaten      cold. The acorn flour was usually baked into bread in crude      ovens or used as a base for soup. Corn meal was often mixed      into the acorn meal.    </p>    <p>      Boiling is the quickest way for rendering acorns edible.      The shelled acorns are boiled, continually changing the      water each time it becomes brown. You know they're done      when you taste them and the bitterness is gone. Though this      method may take only 45 minutes, it does result in a loss      of oils and flavor.    </p>    <p>      A better method is to peel the acorns, place them in a      container, and cover with water. Pour out the water after      24 hours, and replace with fresh warm water. Three or four      changes of water with this non-boiling method should be      sufficient to leach out all of the tannic acid.    </p>    <p>      Once leached, the acorns must be ground into flour and then      dried to ensure a long storage life. If you have a meat      grinder, you can coarsely grind the just leached acorns      while they are still wet and easy to grind. Then the coarse      grind should be dried, and then finely ground with a hand      mill, stone grinder, or heavy duty blender. If you're out      camping, the acorn meal can be ground between rocks.    </p>    <p>      You can use flour in bread, muffins, pancakes, grits, soup,      etc., either alone or mixed with wheat or corn flour.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEDICINALITY:</strong> The bark is used medicinally      for such things as chronic diarrhea, and wherever an      internal astringent is required. Externally, this oak bark      decoction is used for skin sores and as a sore throat      gargle, according to Alma Hutchens, author of <em>Indian      Herbology</em> of North America (Merco, Canada, 1973).    </p>    <p>      <strong>DETRIMENTAL PROPERTIES:</strong> Eating large      amounts of the raw acorns can lead to toxicity due to the      tannic acid. Humans rarely eat toxic amounts of raw acorns      because of the extreme bitterness. Anyone with a normal      sense of taste would find it nearly impossible to consume      large amounts. Those who have persisted in eating raw      acorns have nearly always been stopped short of death      because of the onset of frequent urination, constipation,      abdominal pains, and extreme thirst. Kingsbury, author of      Poisonous Plants in <em>the</em> U.S. <em>and Canada</em>      (Oxford University Press, 1993) included raw acorns on his      list of poisonous plants. He stated that eating large      quantities over a long period of time, results in bloody      stools and other symptoms.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE FOUND:</strong> Oaks are native both to the      temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and to the      mountains of the tropics. Oak trees can be found in the      cities, mountains, deserts, valleys, and in chaparral      areas.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GROWING CYCLE:</strong> Acorns mature and fall from      the trees during September and October.    </p>    <h3>ELDER</h3>    <p>      Honeysuckle Family (Sambucus sp.) (Caprifoliaceae)    </p>        <p>      <strong>OVERALL SHAPE AND SIZE:</strong> Elders can grow      either as shrubs, or as small trees to ten feet tall.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEAVES:</strong> The light-green compound leaves      are divided into five to eleven leaflets. The leaves are      opposite each other, and have slightly serrated margins.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FLOWERS:</strong> The small, white flowers grow in      flat-topped clusters or conical clusters of two to six      inches across. The flowers are followed by small 1/8 to 1/4      inch purple, black, red, or white berries, depending on the      particular species.    </p>    <h3>BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES</h3>    <p>      <strong>EDIBILITY:</strong> You can eat the dark purple      berries, rich in vitamin A, with fair amounts of potassium      and calcium, raw, or mashed, and blend with applesauce for      a unique dessert, especially if you are using wild apples.      You can also use the berries for making wines, jellies,      jams, and pies. The red and white berries are not      recommended for food, some having toxic qualities.    </p>    <p>      You can gather and dip the whole flower cluster in batter,      and fry it, producing a wholesome pancake. Try dipping the      flower clusters in a batter of the sweet yellow cattail      pollen and frying them like pancakes. Wild food at its      best.    </p>    <p>      You can also mix the dried flowers, removed from the      cluster, into flour for baking pastries, breads, etc.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEDICINALITY:</strong> Tea made from the flowers      induces sweating; as such, it is said to be useful for      colds, fevers, and headaches associated with colds. You can      use a poultice of the leaves for wounds, sprains, and      swellings. Use a tea of the fresh or dried leaves as a wash      for skin infections.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DETRIMENTAL PROPERTIES:</strong> The foliage and      root are poisonous if eaten. It affects like a purgative.      The red and white berries are not recommended for food,      some having bitter or toxic qualities. The edible purple      and black berries cause nausea for some if eaten raw.      Cooked, they are harmless. I've seen children chewing on      the pithy core of the dried elderberry stems many times. I      have often done so also, and thus conclude that the DRIED      stems are not harmful, at least not in small amounts.      However, the green stalks can be harmful if eaten. Wilma      Roberts James, author of <em>Know Your</em> Poisonous      Plants (Nature Graph, 1973) says that children who have      made whistles and blowguns from the dried elder stems have      been poisoned. Unfortunately, she does not list the      specific incidents, nor does she tell what type of      poisoning or how much the children in question actually      consumed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE FOUND:</strong> Elder is found throughout the      United States. It does well along rivers and streams. There      are many species of elder, and their preferred locales      include chaparral hillsides, high elevations, low canyon      bottoms, open fields, and even vacant lots.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GROWING CYCLE:</strong> Elder grows to a small      tree. The flowers can be gathered in spring and the berries      ripen around late summer.    </p>    <p>      Excerpted from In the Footsteps of Our Ancestors: Guide to      Wild Foods <em>which is</em> available from the <em>School      of</em> Self-Reliance, P.O. Box 41834, Eagle Rock, CA,      90041, (213) 2559502, for $15 plus $2 for      <em>shipping.</em>    </p>    <h3>GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING PLANTS</h3>        <p>      When discovering new or old plants there are no general      laws or quick "rules-of-thumb" that enable you to know      immediately whether a plant is edible or poisonous.    </p>    <p>      Before picking any plant, consider what you will be using      it for, and only gather the amount you need. There is no      reason to uproot an entire plant.    </p>    <p>      Carefully pick each leaf from the plant so that the least      damage is suffered. Also, no plant should be stripped bare      of all its leaves; this will drastically reduce the      'plant's ability to produce its own food. When the leaves      are carefully gathered by selective pruning the plant will      continue to mature and produce seeds, and in many cases      will live longer as a result of that careful pruning. When      gathering and pruning, one should always consider the need      of wildlife, the next forager, and the future generations      of plants.    </p>    <p>      Abundance of a plant should also be considered. If you see      only a few of a particular type, it may be best to leave      them alone.    </p>    <p>      When digging perennial tubers, corms, bulbs, and tap roots,      the smallest roots should always be replanted so they      continue growing and reproducing.    </p>
