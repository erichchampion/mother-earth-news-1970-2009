                <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong>    </p>    		<p>      <strong>Making easy healthy, and sensible summer      picnics.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      <strong>Rosemary Payne and her granddaughters, Karen and      Kaila, kick back with Anne's favorite picnic      treats.</strong>    </p>    <p>      When it comes to holiday picnic food, there's no arguing      with tradition. Aunt Martha will bring her annual potato      salad, and grandma Bea wouldn't think of coming without her      chocolate cream pie, and there's no way that I'm going to      work it off playing volleyball in this heat. Instead, I've      been lobbying for a spread that's a little lighter so we      can afford that piece of chocolate cream pie. I'm going to      try lots of seasonal fruits and vegetables so when cousin      Harry moans about the carcinogens on the grilled brats, I      can tell him the chlorophyll in green vegetables limits the      body's absorption of carcinogens from grilled meat. That      little factual tidbit will also help take the starch out of      the meat-eaters when they start to circle the wagons.    </p>    <h3>Grilled Chicken Breasts with Vegetables</h3>    <p>      Since white meat is so much more expensive than dark, I      sometimes have the butcher give me boneless, skinless      chicken thighs. (I hate doing the cutting myself.) The      chicken can be served hot or at room temperature.    </p><p><em>6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half (12    pieces) Possible vegetables for grilling: eggplant, sliced    into1/3" circles zucchini or summer squash, sliced    length-wise into 1/3" strips red or yellow sweet peppers,    quartered portabello mushrooms, whole fresh herbs, if    available, for garnishing such as basil, oregano, thyme</em></p>    <h3>Marinade</h3>		<p><em>¼ cup chicken broth<br />    1/3 cup olive oil<br />    ½ cup balsamic vinegar<br />    1-2 tablespoons minced garlic, depending on your    preference<br />    1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br />    2 teaspoons sugar<br />    ½ teaspoon salt a few dashes hot sauce freshly ground    pepper</em></p>        <p>      Whisk the marinade ingredients together in a bowl. Lay the      chicken breasts in a rectangular glass pan or casserole and      pour the marinade over the top just until it covers the      chicken. In another pan, do the same with the sliced      vegetables. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at      least 4 hours or overnight. After a few hours, turn the      chicken and vegetables over in the marinade. Prepare the      grill. When the fire is hot, lay the chicken on the grill      with the vegetables around the edges if there's room. (The      vegetables can be grilled ahead of time if you wish since      they'll be served at room temperature.) Cover and grill for      about 5 minutes per side, watching the vegetables so that      they don't burn. Brush the chicken with marinade if it      starts to dry out. Add mesquite to the coals after the      chicken is turned over if you wish. Discard the mari nade.      Arrange on a platter and sprinkle with chopped herbs. Place      the grilled vegetables around the edge of the platter.    </p>    <h3>COB CORNER-CORN ON THE GRILL</h3>    <p>      It wouldn't be a barbecue without corn on the cob, summer      corn so sweet and juicy that it barely needs butter. Why      not throw it on the grill to save yourself the trouble of      running indoors? Grilling corn takes a little longer than      the kettle-of-boiling-water method so you may want to grill      the corn first, then keep it warm in a covered roasting pan      while you barbecue the rest of the meal. Buy justpicked      corn at a farm stand and grill it the same day if possible.      Keep the corn in the husks and refrigerate or keep in a      cool place until needed.    </p>    <h3>Grilling Methods</h3>    <p>      Some folks wrap the husked corn and butter in foil to set      on the grill, but I find that this way wastes time, foil,      and you end up with steamed corn, which you could have done      indoors. Grilled corn should taste ...uh, grilled.    </p>    <p>      Here's a simple way that works well for a large crowd but      you'll need a large grill (or two). Peel away most of the      outer husk until there's only a thin layer covering the      corn. (The kernels should not show through.) Don't bother      with the silk since it'll peel off later with the husks.      Stick the ears vertically in a pail of cold water for about      30 minutes while you start the grill. When the grill is      medium hot, lay the ears side by side on the grill and      close the lid if there is one. Turn the ears every 5      minutes or so. After 15-20 minutes, check to see if the      kernels near the base of the ear are tender. The husks will      be browned and blackened in spots. Let your family peel      back the husk to use for a handle and dunk their corn in      the butter.    </p>    <p>      For very grilled corn, try this method. Round up the kids      to husks the corn. (Tell them if they don't work, they      don't eat). Brush the corn with canola or another mild oil.      Place the ears directly on the grill. Keep turning them      with thongs because they'll burn easily. The corn should be      ready in 4-5 minutes.    </p>    <h3>Corn Dunkin’ Recipes</h3>    <p>      Have a clean, 1-pound coffee can ready to set on a warm      edge of the grill. When it's corn dunkin' time, place the      can with hot butter (and whatever else you add) on a plate      near the corn. The butter can also be brushed on the corn.    </p>    <h3>Thyme Butter</h3>    <p>      <em>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter Or to lower      saturated fat; ¼ cup unsalted butter, ¼      canola oil<br />      5-6 fresh thyme twigs<br />      2 large cloves garlic, smashed dash cayenne pepper and salt      to taste</em>    </p>    <p>      Heat the sauce on the grill in the coffee can or on the      stove in a saucepan for about 10 minutes until the garlic      is soft. Be careful not to burn the butter. Seasoning can      be added to the butter at the end or directly on the corn.    </p>    <h3>Texas Butter</h3>    <p>      ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter (or use half canola      oil)<br />      ¼ lime juice<br />      1 tablespoon chili powder add pepper to taste Heat on the      grill or stove until hot.    </p>    <p>      Note: The vegetables can be slightly firm when you remove      them from the grill since they will soften as they sit.    </p>    <h3>Three Bean Salad with Roasted Garlic      Dressing</h3>    <p>      Here's a '90s version of the old picnic standby. The      roasted garlic for the dressing can be made a day or two      ahead. This salad serves about six people, so you'll need      to double it for a big crowd.    </p>    <p>      <em>¼ pound green or yellow beans (or a      mixture)<br />      1 15-16 ounce can red kidney beans<br />      1 15-16 ounce can cannellini (white kidney) beans*<br />      1 medium red pepper, chopped into half-inch squares<br />      1 medium red onion, quartered and thinly sliced<br />      1 cup chopped herbs: Italian parsley, dill</em>    </p>    <h3>Dressing</h3>    <p>      <em>1 head roasted garlic<br />      2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br />      ¼ cup unsalted chicken broth<br />      ¼ cup white wine vinegar<br />      1 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br />      ½ teaspoon salt<br />      1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper freshly ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Cut the top off a large head of garlic and wrap it in foil.      Place in a 400°F oven for 1 hour until the cloves are      mushy and slightly browned. Refrigerate until ready to use.      Wash and string the green beans. Cut into 1-l½ inch      pieces. Place in a vegetable steamer or a small amount of      water in a covered saucepan. Simmer for about 2 minutes      just until tender. (They should still be slightly crisp.)      Remove from heat immediately and rinse the beans under cold      water. Place in a large salad bowl. In a colander, rinse      the canned beans under cold water. Add to the bowl with the      pepper and onion.    </p>    <p>      If you're making the salad the day before, add the herbs      and the dressing just before serving. Spoon out the garlic      pulp and place in the blender. Add the rest of the dressing      ingredients and blend until smooth. Toss with the salad and      herbs. Serve at room temperature.    </p>    <p>      * To make a large batch for a crowd, double the recipe and      use a 9½”x13" pan or one of a similar size.    </p>    <h3>Creamy Dill Potato Salad</h3>    <p>      <em>3 pounds white or red-skinned small, new potatoes<br />      6 green onions, chopped<br />      ¼ cup chopped, fresh dill optional garnish: fresh      dill sprigs, cherry tomatoes, cucumber</em>    </p>    <p>      Simmer the potatoes in a vegetable steamer in a covered pot      for about 30 minutes until firm-done. (There shouldn't be      resistance when stabbed with a fork, but if the potato      falls apart they're overcooked.) Chill until cold. Small,      new potatoes can be left whole, larger ones cut into 1-inch      chunks. In a large bowl, gently toss with the other      ingredients and the dressing. Cover and chill for at least      2 hours. The salad can be made a day ahead.    </p>    <h3>Lowfat Dressing</h3>    <p>      <em>1 cup thick nonfat yogurt (1 use Dannon)<br />      1 cup lowfat cottage cheese (I don' t like the taste of the      nonfat cottage cheese but you can use it)<br />      2 teaspoons minced garlic<br />      ½ teaspoon salt (more to taste)<br />      1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper freshly ground pepper or white      pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Drain off any yogurt water before measuring. Place all the      ingredients in the blender and blend until smooth. Put into      a jar or plastic container for up to 2 days until you need      it.    </p>    <h3>Fruit Crumble</h3>    <p>      Here's a healthy alternative to Aunt Gertrude's      chocolate-marshmallow bars. This is so easy, the kids can      make it. No mixer needed, just stir the topping by hand. I      use whatever fresh fruit is in season as long as it's ripe      and sweet. Frozen fruit doesn't work since it's too watery.    </p>    <p>      <em>about 3½ cups fresh berries (raspberries,      blueberries) and cherries about 1½ cups sliced plums      or nectarines (Peaches are too juicy this recipe.)<br />      1 teaspoon arrowroot flour (for thickening)<br />      1 tablespoon sugar, add more if the fruit isn't very      sweet</em>    </p>    <h3>Topping</h3>    <p>      <em>¼ cup brown sugar, packed<br />      ½ teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1 cup whole wheat pastry flour (or unbleached white      flour)<br />      3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 375°F. Carefully toss the fruit      with the arrowroot and sugar. Pour into an 8" or 9"-square      baking pan or a casserole of similar size. Pit the cherries      and pull or cut them into halves. Melt the butter.    </p>    <p>      In a mixing bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon, and flour      together with a fork. (Measure the flour by spooning it      into the cup with a large spoon and leveling it off with a      knife.) Add the butter and mix with the fork until the      dough is the size of small peas. Spoon evenly on top of the      fruit. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the top is lightly      browned. Cool for at least 30 minutes before spooning into      bowls. Serve with vanilla frozen yogurt or ice cream.    </p>    <h3>GETTING IT THERE</h3>    <p>      It's not only important <em>what</em> you serve but how you      serve it. The Center for Disease Control reports that      food-born illnesses increase during summer months due to      unsafe food practices. Picnic food needs to be either very      hot or very cold, with danger zone temperatures in-between.      (Bacteria can multiply rapidly on a hot day.) Forget that      fleeting fantasy about poisoning a relative or two. Here      are some food safety tips for holiday-happy meals.    </p>    <p>      Transport food in a cooler: Unless your relatives live near      by, it's a good idea to transport food in a cooler with ice      packs. Chances are that there won't be room for your      coleslaw in Aunt Martha's refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Set up a sun-safe buffet: If your food table is outside,      place it in the shade taking into account the rotation of      the sun. Keep the food covered until you're ready to serve.      I set cold foods in large, rectangular restaurant pans      filled with ice. (You could also use disposable foil      roasting pans.) This will enable the guests to graze the      buffet for an hour or so without concern.    </p>    <p>      Keep hot foods hot: If you entertain often, you might want      to check a restaurant supply store for a used chaffing dish      that uses sternos. Stemos burn for 2-4 hours, which will      enable you to keep grilled meat hot. (My large, rectangular      chaffer has a bottom pan for an inch of water, an insert      pan for food, and a lid.) If you don't have a chaffing      dish, cover the meat with foil and only grill on demand.      Leftover cooked meat can be wrapped and placed in a cooler.      (Warning regarding stenos: Even after they burn out they're      extremely hot so don't throw them in the garbage can until      they've completely cooled. Don't ask how I know this. Let's      just say that the firefighters who were called to the      forest preserves were not amused.)    </p>    <p>      Watch out for cross-contamination: Plates, knives, and      utensils that came in contact with raw meat should be taken      inside and washed before they're used for other foods. Use      a different platter for the cooked meat. Leftover meat      marinades should be thrown out after the meat is on the      grill.    </p>    <p>      When in doubt, throw it out: Don't send leftovers that have      been sitting out all day home with the relatives. Most      fruit and vegetables, desserts, and vinegar-based salads      should be fine if they have only been out for a short time.      Throw out high-risk foods that contain meat and dairy      products.    </p>
