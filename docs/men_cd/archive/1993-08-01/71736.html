            		<p>      <strong>Seasons</strong>    </p>          <p><em>August's blue      moon is followed by migrating monarchs and a meteor      shower.</em></p>		<h5 id="byline">      <em>By Fred Schaaf.</em>    </h5>        <p>      Once the Dog Days are over, the rest of August and      September offers us the year's finest days to be outdoors      and alive. This is particularly enhanced by the beautiful,      somewhat bittersweet feeling that summer is gradually being      lost. Once I feel the first late-August cold front truly      break the siege of summer, see the swallows begin to gather      for departure, and notice the sunsets get rapidly earlier,      I know that summer's golden days are numbered and that      autumn's pageant of beauty and change is near at hand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Seasons and calendar: Equinox and Blue      Moon</strong>    </p>    <p>      It's during the autumn equinox that the Sun crosses the      equator, making day and night everywhere of equal length.      Some cultures viewed this time period as so important that      they actually began and based their calendar year at or      during the equinox. Such was the case of both the ancient      Spartans and Macedonians-the latter's calendar      becoming of widespread importance when Alexander the Great      whirled out of Macedonia and conquered the "known world."      The Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah ("head of the year"),      begins with the sunset nearest the new moon t hat falls      closest to the autumn equinox. As most farmers can tell      you, the harvest moon is said to be the full moon closest      to the autumn equinox. However, this year the full moon of      August 31 will hold its own special distinction: it will be      a spectacular "blue moon:"    </p>    <p>      <strong>SKY CALENDAR OF SPECIAL EVENTS FOR 1993</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>AUGUST</strong>    </p>		        <p>      These days a blue moon is somewhat of a calendrical      curiosity since the definition alters with time. Presently      the blue moon is said to be the second full moon when there      are two full moons in a calendar month. But there is also a      phenomenon by which the Moon (or Sun) can actually appear      distinctly blue in color (or sometimes green or      "brass-colored"). This occurs when particles in clouds are      all about the same (unusually small) size-often due      to the effects of major forest fires or dusty volcanic      eruptions. These particles scatter out the longer      wavelengths of light, leaving alone the shorter      wavelengths, which are bluer-or blue and      green-in color. It was the pall of particles from      Canadian forest fires, for example, that produced the      amazing blue moon and Sun seen in New England and parts of      the mid-Atlantic states on September 24, 1950. (I'll      discuss this remarkable event in greater detail in future      issues.)    </p>    <p>      Americans will be able to seek out the blue moon of August,      as the Moon will be full on both August 2 and 31. <em>Note:      The eastern hemisphere will experience our August 31 moon      on September 1 (their time) and their blue moon (the second      of their month) on September 30.</em> We can just fit two      full moons into a 30-day-long month because the Moon's      "synodic period" (the time from one phase to the next      recurrence of that phase) is approximately 29 1 / 2 days.      Of course, that explains why you'll never see the      phenomenon in February-even on a leap year. But how      often does a year have a month with the supposedly rare      "once in a blue moon" blue moon? The interval between one      such blue moon and the next is less than three years.      Writer Guy Ottewell points out that about only one year in      19 has two months with a blue moon. The next will be 1999,      when both January and March have two full moons.    </p>    <p>      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>Astronomy: See Seven      Planets</strong>    </p>    <p>      The most exciting sky event likely to occur this season is      the Perseid meteor storm. (See "Enjoy a Perseid Shower" on      page 21 for discussion of this potentially stupendous      event.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Diagrams for dusk and dawn show scenes about 45      minutes after sunset or before sunrise, as viewed from 40'      north latitude (approximately correct for the United States      or southern Canada). "Age" of the moon is amount of time      since new moon.</strong> <strong>-Adapted from Sky      Calendar, Abrams Planetarium, Michigan State University,      East Lansing Michigan 48824.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Besides the possible "shooting star" deluge and the      interesting full moons, there are plenty of planets visible      this August and September. Saturn, at its brightest, rises      in the east-southeast and is visible all night long. Bright      Venus and always-low Mercury are at their highest in the      east before dawn (watch 45 minutes before sunup) in early      August. Jupiter and Mars have a close conjunction (meeting)      low in the west-southwest at dusk on September 4 to 6, and      form a lovely but low grouping with the star Spica, and a      lunar crescent at dusk on September 17. Have veteran      observers help you glimpse the far and dim Uranus and      Neptune having their last conjunctions with each other      until the middle of the 22nd century.    </p>    <p>      <em>The most cloud-free period of the year is late August      to late October.</em>    </p>		    <p>      <strong>Enjoy a Perseid Shower</strong>    </p>    <p>      Chances are, just a few hours before darkness begins      falling in the United States on August 11, Europe will see      what may be one of the greater meteor displays in history.      It's also possible that the aftermath of the shower's peak      will provide quite a view for Americans, displaying      hundreds of meteors per hour.    </p>    <p>      To refresh your memory, a meteor is the streak of light      produced when a piece of space rock or iron enters our      atmosphere at such great speed that it burns up from      friction with the air. A meteor shower is an increased      number of meteors appearing to come from a single spot      among the constellations. And the Perseid meteor shower      (from the constellation Perseus) is often the best of all      annual meteors showers, producing as many as 50, 60, or      sometimes more meteors for observers to see.    </p>    <p>      But this year the Earth is likely to see a super display of      the Perseids. The parent comet of the meteors,      Swift-Tuttle, finally returned to the inner solar system      last year and on August 11 we will be passing close a to      where it went late last December.    </p>    <p>      Many experts think the Earth will experience the Perseid      meteor storm. In 1991, the Perseids poured over Japan at      rates of 300 to 400 per hour for one hour. Last year, the      Moon was full and cloudiness prevailed over the Far East,      but again that part of the world was rained over by a      powerful Perseid burst. There were so many meteors that      bright ones were visible like flashes of lightning even      through the clouds. Rates of a few thousand might have been      visible in the hour of outburst if skies had been clear.    </p>    <p>      The world's leading authority on comet and meteor stream      orbits, Harvard Universitys Brian Marsden, thinks the great      burst will be at its best around 6:22 Pmt.      EDT-approximately an hour and a half before sunset on      the East Coast. Marsden also calculates that this August      11, Earth is coming closer to the orbit of the parent comet      years. Yet there are records a mere thousands years ago of      Perseid storms so strong that meteors "fell like snow!"    </p>    <p>      There is something U.S. viewers can do to increase their      chances of catching the storm outburst if it occurs over      America (or at least if a strong aftermath should oc cur).      First of all, try to find a site many miles away from city      light. (Be prepared to view far less if the sky is hazy      that night.) On August 11, look in the northeast sky      between 6 P .m. and 7 P.m. just to make sure that there      aren't some day-bright Perseids zooming there. Keep your      fingers crossed as darkness falls after 8 P .m. Even then,      the constellation Perseus is still low in the northeast,      but if the spate occurs, the sight will still be      tremendous.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Weather: Clear Sides and Hurricanes</strong>    </p>    <p>      There comes a cold snap in late August or early September      when I always say: "Summer's back is broken." The period      from then until late October is the most cloud-free month      (and longer) of the year across most of the eastern half of      the United States. For much of the Southwest, June is the      most cloud-free, while July is for the Pacific Northwest      and northern Rockies. For nowhere in the 48      states-except southern Florida-is any month      from November through May most cloud-free.    </p>    <p>      But September is not all coolness and clarity, and neither      is August for that matter. These two months are the dreaded      months of hurricane season. And this isn't only true for      prime targets, Florida and the Gulf Coast. Hurricanes need      warm water, but the oceans take longer to cool down from      summer's maximum solar radiation than the atmosphere. Thus      it is quite possible for spots far north of the Atlantic      Coast to get hit by devastating hurricanes in September and      October, and possibly even early November.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Living World: Monarchs</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fall migrations begin in August (actually a little earlier      for some species, believe it or not) and rise to a peak in      September. Everywhere, birds are on the move. But it is not      just birds that migrate or are capable of winging thousands      of miles, sometimes across hundreds of miles of water. So,      too, does one of the few members of the insect world that      is adored by just about everyone-the monarch      butterfly.    </p>    <p>      I can't tell you exactly when to look for the most monarchs      passing by because they seem to come in different groups      from August through October, and the weather and other      complications mean that the size and time of the largest      group may vary greatly each year. If you're lucky, you'll      be near a bay or large lake where the butterflies pause to      refresh themselves on the nectar of plants before      attempting the perilous crossing. The most spectacular      display I've ever seen in New Jersey was on October 9, when      some tall cedar trees near our bay were literally covered      with the beautiful, colorful creatures.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the most amazing fact is nearly all of the      monarchs in the eastern United States and Canada winter in      a single tiny locale in the mountains of Mexico; nearly all      of those in the western United States and Canada winter in      a single tiny locale in California. You can visit the      "monarch trees" in Pacific Grove, California, where laws      against bothering these butterflies are, happily, quite      strong.    </p>    <p>      Of all the stories I've heard about them, the most moving      is related by naturalist Edwin Way Teale. In <em>Autumn      Across America</em> , Teale tells how he and his wife were      driving across the Great Salt Lake Desert in Utah and were      depressed by the fact that no plants, birds, reptiles, or      even insects were visible-none were capable of living      in that stretch of white flatness without water. Then Teale      and his wife suddenly saw five spots of color flying      steadily onward-five monarch butterflies were on      their way home to California.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Special Day: Time for Loaf Mass</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cross-quarter days, those that occur halfway through the      seasons, have all been the occasion for holidays. But not      many surpass Lammas, once celebrated widely in the British      Isles on August 1st.    </p>    <p>      There are two theories regarding the origin of the      holiday's name. One holds that it comes from "Lamb-Mass"      because the early Roman church supposedly took a lamb to      the altar when commemorating St. Peter's miraculous freeing      from his prison chains.    </p>    <p>      The other theory holds that the name comes from the Middle      English lammasse, or"loaf mass:' August 1 was when the      people of the British Isles consecrated the first bread      baked from the new wheat or corn of the season. The Old      English form of the holiday's name was hlaf-mass. Our word      "lady" comes from the Old English hlafdig, which means      something similar to "loaf dispenser" or "loaf kneader." On      Lammas it was the custom in England to give money to      servants to buy gloves ("Glove-Silver") and for every      church to have a sheaf placed over its door.    </p>
