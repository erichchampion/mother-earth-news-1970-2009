                     <p><strong>Handworks</strong>    </p>         <p>    <em>Even      first-timers can create intricate baskets with the      "random-weave" teachnique.</em>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">      <em>By Doris Messick.</em>		</h5>        <p>      The woods have been one of my favorite places for as long      as I can remember, and still I find the wonders of nature      fascinating and never ending. While others collect jewelry      artifacts and fancy glassware, I am always thrilled to      bring home a discarded bird's or hornet's nest or beautiful      vines with unusual twists and turns.    </p>    <p>      My second greatest passion is creating things with my      hands. Each time I lay my eyes on a pleasing object, I feel      compelled to make it into something-and something      better, of course. One lifetime is not nearly enough for me      to try everything with which I wish to experiment. For a      while, clay was my favorite medium because it provided a      legitimate excuse to play, get dirty, and basically make a      giant mess. Creating a handsome and presentable object was      icing on the cake.    </p>    <p>      But then I discovered basketry and got hooked after my      first creation. As with pottery, you get to play and make a      mess while beautiful objects emerge, but you don't have to      wait around for the final result-there's no firing in      the kiln, no breakage, and no uncertain glazing.    </p>    <p>      There was just one problem: the more involved in basketry I      became, the more dissatisfied I was with the materials that      I was purchasing. At first I had to rely on mail-order      supplies, which meant I couldn't judge the quality of      materials before making a purchase. So I was thrilled when      I discovered I could make beautiful baskets from the      treasures I found in the woods. Purchased wooden hoops      could not compare with the magically twisted vine handles I      unearthed in my explorations. My old love, a walk in the      woods, was now, happily, a necessity.    </p>    <p>      One of the easiest ways for beginners to get involved with      basketry is to try random weaving-a great, no-fail      project. All you need are a bundle of long and flexible      vines (I suggest honeysuckle), a pair of sturdy garden      clippers, and some twist ties. You can use fresh vines or      boil them first to remove the bark. Because you needn't      worry about materials shrinking-tight weaving is not      characteristic of this style-you can even gather and      weave at the same time. The weaving technique consists      simply of making a framework and filling in the spaces. For      me, it's a quick, fun, and relaxing project to do at the      day's end.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Directions for a Random-Weave</strong>      <strong>Market Basket<br /></strong> <strong>1</strong> .      With one long, continuous piece of vine, form two large      hoops at right angles to each other. The use of one vine      takes advantage of the natural connection holding the hoops      together (see Diagram 1).    </p>    <p>      <strong>2</strong> . Reinforce these hoops with at least      two more loose-twisted vines around the original hoops.      Keep all vines flowing in the same direction as you twist      around the frame (see Diagram 2).    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong> . Continue adding new vines, always      starting at the rim. Secure these vines by twisting several      times in the same direction as the other vines that form      the hoop. As you fill in the framework, imagine that there      is a watermelon resting in the basket, contained by the      weaving. This will help you maintain a sense of the      basket's shape (see Diagram 3).    </p>    <p>      <strong>4</strong> . Form the basket bottom with a vine      beginning in the center of the horizontal hoop and moving      toward the bottom framework of the basket (the lower part      of the handle). Wrap around the bottom framework and      continue around the other side of the basket to the      opposite rim. At this point, and each time you come to the      rim, go completely around it-don't just loop over      it-to lock the weaver in place and to make the vine      lie smoothly along the top of the basket. It is important      to do this correctly or the wrapping will pop up and appear      loose and poorly woven (see Diagram 4).    </p>    <p>      <strong>5</strong> . Continue weaving randomly from side to      side in different directions until the basket shape is      defined by at least four to six vines. Use twist ties to      temporarily hold vines in place where they cross one      another. Don't forget to wrap completely around the rim      each and every time you reach it (see Diagram 5).    </p>    <p>      As you weave remember the invisible watermelon in the      center-go around it, not through it. When you have      several vines, begin to weave under and over them with the      new ones. New weavers no longer need to go from rim to rim,      but in any direction required to define the space. Go over      vines that are protruding and under those that need pushing      out. The under-over weaving locks the vines in place      and firms up the shape. The diagram illustrates the fastest      way to secure the vines, but not the only way. Remove twist      ties when framework is secure.    </p>    <p>      Continue weaving until the basket is sturdy and filled to      your liking. A randomly woven basket can be open and airy      or filled in. Again, I want to emphasize that this is      no-fail, so enjoy yourself as you weave. I filled in every      single hole when I made my first basket. Succeeding ones,      however, became more open and free. I usually like to add      materials until the basket has a nestlike appearance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Two Helpful Hints</strong>    </p>    <p>      Start and end all vines on the rim, so the ends can be      tucked in.    </p>    <p>      As the basket develops, the handle often appears too small      in proportion to the rest of the basket. If this happens,      simply bring another vine up over the handle and weave it      in with the others.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Selection of Fine Pines<br /></strong><br />      <em>If experimenting with different vine baskets seems like      an activity you'd like to get more involved in</em> -      <em>and I warn you, it can be addicting</em> -      <em>you may wish to keep this</em> <em>reference list      handy. It'll give you a brief description of several vines,      along with tips on both finding them and growing them.</em>    </p>    <p>      Wisteria, honeysuckle, kudzu, grape, Virginia creeper, and      akebia are the vines I use most frequently in my basket      making, mainly because they're available to me in the      mid-Atlantic region; of course other parts of the country      also have interesting vines, just waiting to be tried.      Supplejack <em>(Berchemia),</em> which grows in the South,      is actually not too supple, but it makes a delightful,      contorted framework with a smooth gray-green bark.      Bittersweet <em>(Celastrus)</em> has similar      characteristics, but its bark is bumpy, gray, and speckled.      Be warned that neither supplejack nor bittersweet weave      particularly well. Kiwi <em>(Actinidia) is</em> a vine      reputed to be a terrific basket material. Finding what fits      your needs just takes some experimentation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Wisteria.</strong> If I could have but one basketry      plant, it would have to be wisteria. I have yet to find a      technique that can't be done with some part of the wisteria      vine. The large upper growth-with its wonderful      twists and turns formed by its growth around trees and      other obstacles-is my favorite for framework. The      long ground runners, which are its means of propagation,      are the most flexible of the large weavers; half-inch      ground runners can be used with no splitting. Even the bark      of wisteria is a valued commodity, for although it is thin,      it is extremely strong and makes a wonderful wrapping      material. When I want to use the vine, however, I don't      strip the bark; a stripped wisteria vine is usually hairy      and weak. It's perfect as is, as nature intended it.    </p>    <p>      Wisteria is best harvested when it has escaped into the      wild, due to the fact that cultivated plants don't contort      as much when they grow. In the center of my neighbor's      front yard is a wisteria that is so carefully pruned I      wouldn't recognize it if it didn't bloom-no basketry      materials there. If a wisteria is growing on a manicured      lawn, its runners will most likely have been ruined by the      lawn mower.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Honeysuckle.</strong> After wisteria, honeysuckle      is next on my preference list. It is usually found growing      in areas that have been cultivated and then neglected. It      also thrives along rows between fields and lanes, and in      hedges and bushes. You'll find honeysuckle along the edges      of woods, but it needs too much light to grow deep in the      woods. Because honeysuckle is known to choke less      aggressive plants, many people are more than willing to let      you harvest from their property. In fact, they will often      call you if they know you want it.    </p>    <p>      Most basket makers like to strip honeysuckle bark because      it spirals on the vine and tends to shed constantly unless      removed. Spring is therefore a good time to gather it, as      the rising sap makes bark removal easy. If you collect it      at other times, however, just boil it to remove the bark.      The resulting vine is smooth, hard, light in color, and      takes dye well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>If I could have but one basketry plant, it</strong>      <strong>would have to be wisteria. I have yet to      find</strong> <strong>a basket-making technique that can't      be</strong> <strong>done with some part of the wisteria      vine.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kudzu.</strong> In the 1930s kudzu was imported      from Japan for erosion control in the South. It is what I      call a beginner vine because it's so easy to use. Fast      growing and strong, kudzu is used in Japan as cattle feed,      medicine, food, drink, paper, and fabric. Unfortunately,      the extraordinary toughness of kudzu vines causes them to      clog the machinery of our mechanized society, and it is      thus considered more of a weed than a useful plant here in      the United States. It just keeps on growing-covering      trees, houses, and whatever else happens to be in its path.    </p>    <p>      The upper growth is similar in appearance to wisteria,      although not as woody or strong. It is fine for framework      on a decorative piece but is not as durable as you would      expect of a vine of its size. The bark-which is      practically rip-proof-varies in thickness with the      size of the vine; it can be used as weaves, for wrapping,      or even for cordage. My favorite parts, though, are the      ground runners, which j ust go on and on. If used whole,      they kink, but when split, they are wonderfully flexible.      There is none of the breakage or cracking that you get with      so many of the other vines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grapevine.</strong> The first vine everyone thinks      of in relation to baskets is usually grapevine. I love its      delightful tendrils, which I have just recently started      using for free-form miniatures. Grapevines can be wild or      cultivated and they tend to be straighter than other vines,      thus lending themselves to more traditional shapes. It is      most suitable for use as framework. With the exception of      muscadine vines, grapevine is not real flexible and makes      poor weavers, even in the smaller diameters. Although I      love the bark, I almost always boil and strip any grapevine      I use. Prone to insects, it is even more susceptible when      the bark is left on. The boiling kills any eggs within the      vine that could hatch later.    </p>    <p>      It should be noted that muscadine ( <em>Vitis</em>      <em>rotundifolia),</em> which grows in warm climates only,      is usable in wickerwork, where there are no sharp bends.      Its aerial roots are small (,although quite decorative) and      beginners often find the tendrils frustrating to work with      because they catch on everything.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Vi</strong> <strong>rginia creeper.</strong> This      vine is common throughout much of the United States but is      not very strong. It appears to weave best when it's fairly      fresh because, once dry, it can never regain its full      flexibility. As with kudzu, the long ground runners are the      preferred weaves; the tiny tendrils add a lot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Akebia.</strong> A Japanese import, akebia can be      used as harvested or with the bark stripped. Boiled,      stripped akebia can be dyed, but I prefer to use it      natural. A skinny version of kudzu, this vine is excellent      for weaving miniature baskets or for starting larger      baskets where small weavers work best.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Doric Messick is a frequent workshop      leader at both national and regional basketry conventions.
