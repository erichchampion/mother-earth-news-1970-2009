            <p>    <strong>Energy Tips</strong></p>           <p><em>Tips for making around-the-house adventures with your      caulking gun more effective.</em>    </p>        <p>      The yearly ritual begins in September. The old caulking gun      emerges from its hiding place in the shed, is cleaned off,      and does its rounds at the edges of windows and doors. An      hour later and you're buttoned up for the winter. Well, not      exactly. As good an idea as sealing your windows and doors      is, taking aim at a few more trouble spots around the house      will make your efforts much more effective. And because      you're not constantly opening and closing the sources of      air leaks listed below, once you get 'em, you've got 'em.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Common Sources of Air Leaks<br /></strong>      -Plumbing penetrations through insulated floors and      ceilings<br />      -Chimney penetrations through insulated ceilings and      exterior walls<br />      -Gaps along the sill plate and band joist at the top      of foundation walls<br />      -Fireplace dampers<br />      -Attic access hatches<br />      -The tops of interior partition walls where they      intersect with the attic space<br />      -Recessed lights and fans in insulated ceilings<br />      -Wiring penetrations through insulated floors,      ceilings, and walls<br />      -Missing plaster<br />      -Electrical outlets and switches, especially on      exterior walls<br />      -Window, door, and basement moldings<br />      -Dropped ceilings above bathtubs and bathroom      cabinets<br />      - Kneewalls in finished attics, especially at access      doors and built-in cabinets and bureaus.    </p>        <p>      Choosing proper sealant depends on the size of the gaps and      where they are located. Caulk is best for cracks less than      1/4" wide. Read the label carefully to make sure that the      caulk is suitable for the material to be sealed. Look for      brands which remain flexible over a 20-year lifetime. If      the joint will be visible, choose a paintable caulk.    </p>    <p>      Expanding foam sealant is an excellent material to use for      larger cracks. Some brands are not effective when exposed      to sunlight or moisture, so be sure to buy the right type      for your job. If possible, buy foam sealant without ozone      depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.    </p>        <p>      Backer rod or crack filler is a round, flexible foam      material available in diameters of 1/4" to 1". It is      usually sold in long coils and is great for sealing large      cracks and as a backing for deep cracks sealed with caulk    </p>    <p>      Use rigid foam insulation for sealing very large openings      such as plumbing chases and attic hatch covers. Fiberglass      insulation can also be used for sealing large holes, but it      will work better if it is stuffed in plastic bags. Don't      use plastic in areas that reach high temperatures, and      always wear gloves and a mask when working with fiberglass.    </p>    <p>      <em>From</em> Consumer's Guide to Home Energy Savings      (1991), <em>published by the American Council</em> <em>for      an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
