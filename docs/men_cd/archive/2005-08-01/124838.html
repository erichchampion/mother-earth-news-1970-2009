        I worked as a rural mail carrier in Florida for many years. I oftendreaded what I might find each time I opened the mailbox ? wasps,spiders, scorpions and frogs were the most common occupants. One ofmy customers kept a small glass jar of mothballs in her mailbox,with holes in the lid so the fumes could escape. There were neverany insects or other creatures in her mailbox.<br /><br />Now I live in Kentucky and have a small well house where variousspiders and a copperhead snake had taken up residence. I rememberedthe mothballs! So, early each spring, I put new mothballs in theglass jar, and there are no pump-house occupants at all.
