        <p>If you need a new power tool, take a look at battery-operated power tools. They’ve improved over the years and are a great, green choice.</p><p>With lithium-ion batteries, rechargeable tools are <b>lighter and stronger than ever.</b> Lithium-ion batteries hold a charge better and last longer than nickel-cadmium batteries, and there are lots of other advantages to these versatile tools.</p><p>Rechargeable tools are <b>portable.</b> You can use them in remote areas without being concerned about distance from a power outlet or generator. Because the tools aren’t plugged in while you use them, they’re safer - no cords to trip over, get tangled in or cut into. They’re much <b>quieter</b> than tools powered by gas engines, and you don’t have to breathe those nasty fumes while you work.</p><p>If you’re not charging the batteries with power from a gasoline- or diesel-powered generator, rechargeable tools can be a good choice for the environment. You can use one or two batteries for multiple tools, and charge them with electricity generated by a <a title="photo-voltaic" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/2006-10-01/Easy-Solar-Power.aspx" target="_blank">photo-voltaic</a> panel or a <a title="wind turbine" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/2007-06-01/Improved-Wind-Power.aspx" target="_blank">wind turbine</a>.</p><p>In fact, multiple woodworking, yard and garden tools can <b>run on the same battery.</b> The <a title="Black &amp;amp; Decker FSXtreme 18-volt Ni-Cad battery" href="http://www.firestormtools.com/" target="_blank">Black & Decker FSXtreme 18-volt Ni-Cad battery</a> powers 26 different tools including a circular saw, reciprocating saw, flashlight, jigsaw, brad nailer, impact driver, sander, drill and hand vac. And new tools are being developed to run on the same battery.</p><p>Rechargeable tools can be as powerful and fast as corded tools, but generally a bit heavier. For example, the DeWalt <a title="DW368K" href="http://www.dewalt.com/us/products/tool_detail.asp?productID=2964" target="_blank">DW368K</a> is a plug-in 7 1/4-inch circular saw that weighs 9 1/2-pounds. The blade spins up to 5,800 rotations per minute (rpm). The rechargeable <a title="DC300K" href="http://www.dewalt.com/us/products/tool_detail.asp?productID=14868" target="_blank">DC300K</a> (also with a 7 1/4-inch blade that turns up to 4,000 rpm) weighs 9.9 pounds.</p><p>Not all chargers are equally efficient, so the <a title="Energy Star site" href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=battery_chargers.pr_battery_chargers" target="_blank">Energy Star site</a> provides information to help you choose the most energy-efficient models.</p>For more information on rechargeable power tools, read <a title="Cordless Drills and Drivers" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Modern-Homesteading/2005-12-01/Cordless-Drills-and-Drivers.aspx" target="_blank">Cordless Drills and Drivers</a> and <a title="Rechargeable Tools" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Do-It-Yourself/2008-06-01/Rechargeable-Power-Tools.aspx" target="_blank">Rechargeable Power Tools</a>.
