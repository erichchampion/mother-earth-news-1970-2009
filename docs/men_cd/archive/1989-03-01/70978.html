                <p>      <strong>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Learn from your own homegrown lab.<br /></em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">       By Greg and Pat Williams</h5>         <p>      IT SEEMS THAT FEW PEOPLE SHARE our belief that back-yard      gardeners should be encouraged to do amateur research.      After all, there is a pervasive mythology about the      difficulties of conducting scientific investigation: It is      supposed to be expensive, time-consuming, dangerous, boring      <em>and</em> esoteric-in short, best left to      specialists.    </p>    <p>      Of course, <em>some</em> scientific work is hardly      appropriate for amateurs (particle physics, for example),      but many horticultural experiments are inexpensive, safe      and anything but boring. The results of such experiments      can lead to substantial savings of time and money, as well      as tastier produce and more-attractive landscapes. And for      a variety of reasons (including funding limitations), these      experiments aren't likely to be done by professional      researchers-so if they are carried out at all, it      will be by amateurs.    </p>    <p>      Homegrown horticultural research also offers one enormous      advantage over reliance on professionals: The results apply      directly to you. The soil type is your soil type, the      cultivars used are ones you're interested in, the weather      conditions are yours, and so forth. And one of the most      delightful aspects is that (when experiments are designed      and performed in a reasonable way) there are no "wrong"      results, only results that might differ from previous      expectations-thus enabling you to correct those      expectations in accordance with the actual ways of the      world.    </p>    <p>      The North American Fruit Explorers (membership $8 annually      from NAFEX, Rt. 1, Box 94, Chapin, IL 62628) is perhaps the      best current example of an association of amateur      horticultural researchers. Their quarterly, <em>Pomona</em>      , is filled with reports of members' experiments, along      with suggestions for additional studies. And <em>Improve      Your Gardening with Backyard Research</em> by Lois Levitan      (Rodale Press, 1980) is the reference for beginners on how      to design, set up and perform horticultural experiments.      It's currently out of print but might be available through      your local public library.    </p>    <p>      There are many areas that could benefit from amateur      research; natural pest management, mulch, fertilization and      intercropping are just a few. In all, the home gardener      seeking the truth can help all of us learn and grow. So      this year, when you're planning your plot, why not plan one      or two home-grown experiments as well?    </p>    <h3>Research Briefs</h3><p>      <strong>Soak it to me!</strong> Indian botanists claim that      soaking tomato seeds in distilled, room-temperature water      for about six hours, then air-drying them before planting      increased subsequent fruit yields by 44%! The technique      might work for some other vegetables, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bug-fighting cabbages.</strong> According to field      trials conducted by the New York Agricultural Experiment      Station, the "old-time" cabbage varieties Danish Ballhead      and Early Jersey Wakefield show more resistance to thrips      than do newer commercial ones. Red Danish, another "senior      cabbage," shows moderate resistance to both thrips and      cabbageworms. However, of all 24 varieties tested,      up-and-coming (not yet released) Geneva 8395 has the most      resistance to both pests!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grow your own peat</strong> . Purdue University      researchers have found that milled, low-quality alfalfa can      substitute for up to 30% of the peat moss in container      growing mixes if the alfalfa has first been composted for      at least a week. Apparently, the ammonia in fresh alfalfa      can damage seedlings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The ecological price tag</strong> . Two Western      Illinois University scientists, attempting to determine the      "ecological value" of a tree, estimated that an "average"      silver maple might be worth $456 (the value of its      providing such environmental benefits as erosion control      and wildlife habitat). If such figures are valid, many      trees how cut are actually worth more to society than to      lumber mills.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hi-pro corn</strong> . A new corn variety with      twice the usable protein of most other types has been      developed in Mexico. The U.S. National Research Council      predicts that the new corn "will be grown worldwide before      the turn of the century."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Apple lure shoot-out</strong> . Utah State      University tests show that some commercially available      apple-maggot lures (those red, sticky ball traps) last much      longer than others. Ladd Research and Trece lures were      effective for only four or five days. Great Lakes IPM and      Consep Membranes (both AA and BH types) were long-term      performers.    </p>    <h3>Gleanings</h3>    <p>      West Coast gardeners will appreciate the evaluations and      access listings in the 14-page booklet <em>Vegetable      Varieties for Home Gardeners</em> (send a $1 check, payable      to U.C. Regents, to University of California ANR      Publications, 6701 San Pablo Ave., Oakland, CA 94608)....      The 64-page compendium <em>Make Compost in 14 Days</em> is      available free of charge from Organic Gardening, Dept.      OG-14, 33 E. Minor St., Emmaus, PA 18098. . . . Over 1,000      rose varieties are briefly described and rated for quality      in the <em>1989 Handbook for Selecting Roses</em> (send $1      and an SASE to the American Rose Society, P.O. Box 30000,      Shreveport, LA 71130).... For a free software catalogue      that lists 58 horticultural and agricultural computer      programs (each costs around $20), write the IFAS Software      Support Office, University of Florida, Bldg. 1120, Room      203, Gainesville, FL 32611.    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Greg and Pat Williams raise most of      their own food on a small farm and publish</em> HortIdeas,      <em>a fine newsletter on gardening research and products      (available for $15 a year from G. G. & P. Williams, Rt.      1, Box 302, Gravel Switch, KY 40328).</em><br />    </p>
