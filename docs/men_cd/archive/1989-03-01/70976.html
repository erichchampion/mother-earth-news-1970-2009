                <p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>        <p>      The end of winter marks the beginning of a new season of      chores.    </p>         <p>      I HAVE A PAST AND EASY WAY TO clean the exteriors of      windows. First, mix a handful of powdered      electric-dishwasher detergent into a pail of hot water.      (The secret is to use a product that advertises something      like: "Leaves your glasses sparkling clean with no spots.")      Wash the outsides of your windows with this mixture, using      any method you prefer, and immediately rinse them with a      strong spray from your garden hose. Just let them air-dry,      and your windows should be cleaner and shinier (with fewer      spots) than ever before.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Norbert Sanek<br />      Nashville, Tennessee</em>    </p>    <h3>Grilled Chickens</h3>    <p>      We had a problem with dogs digging under the fence that      surrounds our chicken yard. I started collecting discarded      grillwork shelves-the racks made for stoves and      refrigerators. (Junkyards are a good place to look for      them.) When I had a good supply, I laid them on the bare      ground around the fence, wiring them together and to the      fence. Grass soon covered the grills, and I could mow right      over them, but dogs (and other predators) could no longer      dig there.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Charles Anderson<br />      Doyline, Louisiana</em>    </p>    <h3>Clean Those Screens</h3>    <p>      In the spring I take down all my window screens and screen      doors and carry them outside. Then, with a pan of gasoline      and a stiff brush, I scrub all the screening with gasoline.      It removes all the dust and grease and makes my dingy      screens look good as new. <em>[Editor's Note: Remember that      gasoline is very flammable, and also be careful not to      breathe in the fumes.]</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Mrs. J.E. Hansford<br />      DeLeon, Texas</em>    </p>    <h3>Sage Advice</h3>    <p>      When I prune my sage in the spring, I place sprigs in the      kitchen cabinet where I keep such staples as flour and      cornmeal. Weevils and other bugs don't like the odor of      sage, so they go elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Brenda Milum<br />      Batesville, Arkansas</em>    </p>    <h3>The Secret Is Out</h3>    <p>      For velvety soft skin, try this "secret" facial handed down      by my grandmother, who at 93 was almost wrinkle-free. Mix      together a cup of plain flour (no baking powder, baking      soda, etc.), two tablespoons of honey, the contents of one      vitamin E capsule and enough water (try one-fourth cup) to      make a smooth, creamy paste when the ingredients are      stirred or beaten well. After cleaning your face thoroughly      and steaming open the pores with a small towel wrung out in      hot water, coat your face and neck generously with the      cream, avoiding getting it too close to your eyes, nostrils      and mouth. Leave the facial on for about half an hour, then      wash it off with gentle soap and warm water. Follow this      with a cold-water rinse, and pat your skin dry with a      towel. Do this several times a week, and soon your skin      will rival that of any beauty-shop client who's had      expensive salon treatments.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Bill Houston<br />      Florence, Arizona</em>    </p>          <h3>Pumpkin Protection</h3>    <p>      For several years we lost many of our garden plants to      ground hogs and rabbits. Then a friend suggested I plant      the outer border of the whole garden in pumpkins. The vines      form a prickly "fence" that the animals just will not go      through (I wear long pants myself, to climb over). The only      problem was what to do with all those pumpkins in the fall,      and I solved that by giving them to needy families who use      them for baking casseroles and pies and for making      Halloween jack-o'-lanterns for their children.    </p>    <p>      <br />      <em>-Deanna Overmyer<br />      North Webster, Indiana</em>    </p>    <h3>Free and Easy</h3>    <p>      I collect discarded plastic forks and spoons and use them      as row markers. After washing them, I just write the name      of the planted flower or vegetable on the handle with a      permanent marker, and stick the eating end into the soil.      This practice not only saves money;<br />      it's one more way to recycle.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Pam Prescott<br />      Santa Barbara, California</em>    </p>    <h3>A Trio of Tips</h3>    <p>      A dime-store art-gum eraser will remove a lot of marks from      wallpaper, especially those smudges around light switches.      To make chrome fixtures (kitchen and bathroom faucets,      etc.) shine in a minute, clean them with an old cloth      dipped in kerosene. And to get rid of rust in the corners      of such things as baking pans, scrub them with a cut raw      potato dipped in scouring powder.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Joanna Arnold<br />      Smithville, Tennessee</em>    </p>    <h3>Test Run for Seeds</h3>    <p>      I save the seeds from my best-producing vegetables,      but-come spring-1 like to make sure they're      going to germinate. To do so, I count out about 40 seeds of      each type of plant and scatter each group between several      layers of wet newspaper. I make these into little packets      that I fold up in plastic wrap. After a week, the good      seeds will have germinated. I estimate the percentage of      good seeds to "bad" in each group, and, for example, if      only half the seeds in a packet have sprouted, I plant that      type of seed twice as thick as I normally would.    </p>    <p>      <em>-V.S. Moore<br />      Montezuma, Georgia</em>    </p>    <h3>More on Seeds</h3>    <p>      To plant the tiny seeds of lettuce, dill, carrots and such,      I sprinkle them on a cookie sheet and take them out to the      garden along with a supply of wet, 12-inch pieces of cotton      string (kite string is great). I pull each string through      the seeds; they stick to the strings, which I then just lay      in the garden and cover over with a little soil. It's easy      to plant straight rows, and it saves on seed too.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Sandy Pfeffer<br />      Desoto, Missouri</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all discovered a few practical,      time-tested solutions to some of the frustrating little      problems of everyday life.
