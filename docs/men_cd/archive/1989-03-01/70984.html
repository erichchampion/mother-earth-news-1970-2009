                <p>      <strong>OPEN ROAD</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Alfred Meyer</h5>        <p>      EVEN BEFORE RICHARD NIXON AND Henry Kissinger first went to      China, stories had begun trickling out of the People's      Republic about the local penchant for detecting the onset      of earthquakes. Barnyard animals and even wild birds, it      was touted, behaved oddly in the minutes and sometimes      hours before the event.    </p>    <p>      The news caused considerable stir in northern California,      where I lived at the time, and not a few nervous types      promptly went out and bought themselves chickens, rabbits      or goats and began keeping a sharp eye peeled. Some of      these same people, incidentally, had already taken to      sleeping in beds equipped with roll bars, in case their      ceilings came crashing down in the middle of the night.      They understood, and appreciated, the danger. Those of us      less provident ignored it altogether, content simply to      drink a little more California wine.    </p>    <p>      Some seismologists, however, felt compelled to look into      the stories from China; a few of them going so far as to      consult biologists, gamekeepers and farmers in quake-prone      areas to see if they had ever noticed anything      funny-like cocks crowing at noon, rabbits refusing to      couple, goats suffering indigestion, birds heading south      that had just arrived exhausted from the trip north. Any      behavior connected with the rumbles underfoot? Unusual      avoidance activity, for example. Dogs climbing trees or      cats failing to land on their feet? Had anyone had the      diligence to note not only what was going on in the      barnyard but also with the weather, the planets, the      various constellations and the Richter scale? The real      question was, did animals possess some kind of "geo-gland"      enabling them to sense changes in the earth's magnetic      field or, more to the point, the first faint vibrations of      tectonic plates starting to shear apart way down below the      surface?    </p>    <p>      Clear answers never emerged, not even from the Chinese, and      before long the questions petered out, as did widespread      American interest in the I Ching, barefoot doctors and the      Great Wall. The seismologists went back to their ordinary      studies, concerning themselves in recent years not only      with switching from analog to digital mode on their      recording devices-gone is the revolving papered drum      with squiggly lines on it-but with blanketing the      globe with seismic stations to monitor both natural and      man-made tremors, especially those of the underground      nuclear kind.    </p>    <p>      The rub is that while the recording instruments have grown      increasingly sensitive, and their interpretation more      sophisticated, the ability to predict earthquakes with      reasonable punctilio remains elusive. Ask anyone in Soviet      Armenia.    </p>    <p>      "What happened to our Soviet scientists?" demanded one      Armenian bitterly last December, his dwelling and his town      turned into toothpicks and brick piles, his family crushed      beneath them.    </p>    <p>      "Why didn't they warn us?"<br />      Alas, they didn't know, just as American scientists don't      know when a big one will hit California (or New York or      Georgia, for that matter). All they know is that one will,      sooner or later. To be fair, our scientists might be      slightly more advanced than their Soviet counterparts in      calculating the odds of such an event. For, like our      medicine, our science excels in the bookmaker's art, which      is to say it rides on the backs of the laws of probability.      But it is still a chancy business.    </p>    <p>      I met Charles Richter once, which is a little like meeting      Ohm (of electrical fame), Boyle (of gas fame) or even      Murphy (of screw-up fame, who said, "What can go wrong will      go wrong"). A modest man, Richter belittled his own      contribution.    </p>    <p>      "All I did was create a scale to keep track of the relative      magnitudes of earth tremors," he said, uncomfortable, as      though with ill-gotten celebrity. But if he was shy and      retiring on that front, he was emphatic on another.    </p>    <p>      "What irks me," he famed, "is that people expect to be told      the exact time and place of an earthquake, which may well      be impossible. Meanwhile, they keep building substandard      housing, and on fault zones, no less. We know geologically      which areas are quake-prone, and we have the building      technology to make virtually all dwellings quake-proof. Yet      people still demand the magic bullet, the prediction, and      become impatient with sensible damage-prevention measures."    </p>    <p>      In the last couple of decades, Californians have gotten      better, what with stricter building codes now in force. Yet      many still ignore the odds and evade the codes, throwing up      on precipitous sites what can only amount to ephemeral      housing. The same is true on the Southeast coast, where      fragile summer houses perch on shifting ribbons of beach,      though the dangers they face come from wave erosion and the      teeth of hurricanes rather than earthquakes. Nevertheless,      it's the same kind of Russian roulette. Speaking of which      ...    </p>    <p>      As Soviet investigators acknowledged afterward, the tragedy      in Armenia was compounded by what they called "slipshod      building methods." The admission becomes doubly poignant      when you realize that in Armenia, as in most of the rest of      the Soviet Union, the vast majority of residential housing      is made up of high-rise apartments, each typically holding      hundreds of units, each unit holding Lord knows how many      people.    </p>    <p>      Before the December 7 earthquake, visitors to the Soviet      Union often joked about the apartment buildings, commonly      referring to them as "rabbit hutches" or "the crowning      egg-crates of Stalinesque architecture." Not that their own      locales-New York, London, Tokyo,      wherever-didn't sprout similar monstrosities. But      their gibes were intended to make political points, as      well, perhaps, as aesthetic and psychological ones. No one      thought that what would really matter one day in the winter      of '88 would be seismic ones. The quake, at its epicenter      in Soviet Armenia, registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.    </p>
