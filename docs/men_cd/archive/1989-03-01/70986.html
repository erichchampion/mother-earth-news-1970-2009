                <p><strong>PET CONCERNS</strong></p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Randy Kidd, D.V.M.</h5>         <p>      I WATCH FROM THE WINDOW AS ONE of my favorite patients      climbs out of the car. He's a huge German shepherd named      Von Hunkermann. The Von is graying at the temples, and for      all the years I've known him-despite the pain he's      had-he's always been a pure wag-tailed,      lick-your-face joy to be around.    </p>    <p>      Today, however, he struggles. The jump from the car to the      ground is almost too much for his diseased hips to stand.      There's a visible wince as he lands; a barely audible      whimper escapes his lips. He tries to wag his tail, but the      effort is too painful for even this stoic German to bear.    </p>    <p>      The Von is suffering from hip dysplasia, a disease he was      born with and a pain that will only get worse as he ages.      Hip dysplasia affects many of our dogs, but it can be      especially prevalent in the larger breeds, such as the      Saint Bernard, Newfoundland, bull-mastiff and rottweiler      (see the accompanying sidebar).    </p>    <p>      Von Hunkermann's pain comes from a severe arthritis      surrounding both hips. If I were to take an x-ray, I would      see an intense bone formation around the hip joints and      possibly some bone chips floating in the joint capsule      itself. Every time the Von moves, his hips grind against      the roughened edges of the excess bony growths. I can only      imagine his suffering.    </p>    <p>      All these changes were brought on by hips that were too      loose from birth. The dysplastic ball-and-socket hip      joint-instead of fitting snugly and cleanly as a      normal hip joint would-slipped and slid around like a      size-nine foot in a size-12 shoe. As the Von's hips creaked      and popped (in some severe cases you can actually hear the      creaking as the dog walks), the bony growths were being      deposited to compensate for the excess joint movement.    </p>    <p>      As I watch the Von, I wish there was more I could do for      him-more his owners could afford. But there isn't. So      we will do all we can for his pain and hope that the next      puppy his owners choose is free from the disease. And I can      help them with that selection process. You see, hip      dysplasia is a genetic disease passed down to succeeding      generations. If one has enough information to pick I the      right parents, the pups they produce should be free of      dysplasia.    </p>		        <p>      The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals Based on 100 or more      evaluations of each breed for hip dysplasia conducted by      the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) was formed in      1966 to help evaluate future canine parents for their      potential to pass along the traits that eventually create      hip dysplasia. OFA takes x-rays of dogs two years old or      older to screen breeding stock. The x-rays show a clear      indication of the presence or absence of hip dysplasia.    </p>    <p>      By selecting a puppy produced by animals judged free of      dysplasia by OFA, you greatly reduce your chances of      getting a pet that will develop the ailment. Now, this      assurance-as you might guess-doesn't come      cheap. Expect to spend more money for a dog whose      bloodlines are certified free from dysplasia. The price,      though, will be well repaid.    </p>    <p>      In addition to parental influence, there are other factors      that seem to add to the potential for developing the      disease. For example, not only is dysplasia more prevalent      in the bigger breeds, but it crops up more often in the      biggest <em>individuals.</em>    </p>    <p>      Apparently, the faster a dog grows and the more it weighs,      the better are its chances of becoming dysplastic. So, the      best choice in a litter is probably the somewhat smaller,      but active and aggressive, pup-not the "lard-ball"      whose idea of a big day is to stroll from the food dish      into someone's arms for a round of serious cuddling. Also,      you can help prevent dysplasia by simply limiting your      pup's caloric intake a bit so that it's not at maximum      during his growing months. Of course you don't want your      dog to be a walking skeleton, so check with your vet for a      good nutritional program that'll limit the pup's weight      gain somewhat but still provide all the essential      nutrients.    </p>    <p>      That active pup in the litter may have another advantage,      too. There is a definite correlation between the amount of      hip muscle mass and the incidence of hip dysplasia. The      firmer and bigger the hip muscles, the less chance there is      for dysplasia. When you're looking for a pup, select one      with strong, robust hip and thigh muscles.    </p>    <p>      Also, although x-rays aren't conclusive until the dog is at      least two years old, your vet may be able to give you a      fair idea of a young dog's potential for dysplasia. There      are a number of tests an experienced veterinarian can      perform on pups four to 12 weeks of age that may help spot      the individual dog that is definitely on its way to      dysplasia. In one such test, the vet will anesthetize the      dog and then manipulate its hind legs to detennine just how      loose the hip joints are.    </p>    <p>      Besides genetics and physical structure, there are other      factors that may (or may not, depending on which expert you      listen to) contribute to the development of hip dysplasia.      For example, hormonal activity may be involved. And      nutrition or exercise may play a part. In one study,      supplementing puppy diets with vitamin C was shown to play      an important pan in helping to prevent dysplasia. Other      experts advise a puppy exercise regimen in which you gently      move the dog's hip joints several times a day.    </p>    <p>      Any of these factors <em>may</em> have an effect on the      development of dysplasia, but at this point in time we      can't really say for sure.    </p>    <p>      I do know that I can't overstress the importance of trying      to avoid hip dysplasia. There is nothing sadder than seeing      a once-regal creature reduced to a pitiful image of its      former self, obviously withered by constant pain. And once      the animal develops the disease, there is no simple cure.    </p>    <p>      At this late stage in the progression of Von Hunkermann's      dysplasia, for example, about all I can offer him is a      daily supply of painkillers. Aspirin has worked so far, but      I know that eventually, as his pain becomes even more      severe, no amount of medication will be enough.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps if we had caught the disease in an earlier stage we      could have opted for a pectinotomy, a fairly simple      operation in which one of the muscle tendons on the inside      of the thigh is severed. The operation reduces the pain,      but the progress of the disease-the bony, arthritic      changes-continues.    </p>    <p>      Or maybe, earlier on, we could have performed a technical      (and, you guessed it, expensive) operation in which the      angle of the ball-and-socket joint itself is realigned. The      procedure has been effective in some cases when performed      early. But in Von Hunkermann's situation, the dysplastic      changes have progressed much too far.    </p>    <p>      We have one final option for the Von-the ultimate      solution. We could have his entire hip replaced with a      prosthesis: a polyethylene socket glued into his hip, and a      ball made of cobalt chromium alloy fused onto his femur      (thigh bone). But we'd have to refer the Von to a      veterinary specialist for this high-tech operation, and I      know there's no reason to pursue the option farther. The      expense of the procedure is simply out of the question for      the Von's owners.    </p>    <p>      So, the Von is stuck with his pain, I'm stuck with      prescribing painkillers, and the owners, perhaps, are stuck      with a lifetime regret-the wish that they'd known      enough to choose a pup less likely to develop the disease      in the first place.    </p>
