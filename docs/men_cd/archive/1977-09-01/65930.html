                    <hr />        <p>      Southern cooks have long recognized okra    </p>    <p>      (or "gumbo", as we also call it) as a staple in the      kitchen, and there's hardly a summer garden in the      Southeast that doesn't boast at least one planting of      Hibiscus esculentus.    </p>    <p>      The notion that okra can (or should) be grown only in the      South, however, is both incorrect and unfortunate.      Incorrect, because okra can be cultivated successfully as      far north as Michigan . . . and unfortunate, because a      steaming-hot bowl of shrimp gumbo would taste as delightful      in any northern home as it does in my South Carolina      kitchen!    </p>    <p>      And-in addition to its value as a foodbearing plant-okra      (like any other hibiscus) is also a beautiful ornamental.      (Many folks who can't spare room in their gardens for the      5'-tall standard varieties of okra make space in their      flower borders for 3'-tall dwarfs.) Few people suspect that      the burgundy-throated yellow blossoms borne by this plant      give rise to a steady harvest of edible pods throughout      summer and into the fall frosts.    </p>        <p>      Why not add a little variety to your vegetable menu (and      beauty to your garden) next season by growing some okra?      Okra culture is neither difficult nor complicated ... and      the eventual rewards-in taste, nutrition, and a prettier      garden-are well worth the small amount of effort involved.    </p>    <p>      Your first consideration, of course, must be soil      preparation. The fast-growing, woody plants of H.      esculentus require rich soil, plenty of moisture, and      abundant sunlight. You'll want to work plenty of humus into      the ground to ensure good drainage, since okra seeds tend      to rot in mucky soil . . . and if the topsoil isn't fairly      rich in nutrients, you'll want to dig manure into it, too.      It isn't necessary to spade up a large area . . . one      15-foot row is enough to keep most families in okra for a      summer.    </p>    <p>      Although you can prepare the soil any time during fall or      spring, it's best not to plant okra (which is a heat-loving      crop) until the soil is warm and all danger of frost has      passed. Sow seed thinly in the row, or plant in hills 24"      apart. When the seedlings are well along, thin them to      stand 18" to 24" apart in the row (or one plant per hill).      Afterwards, mulch the young plants heavily to conserve      moisture and discourage the growth of nutrient-robbing      weeds.    </p>    <p>      Okra requires tittle further attention untilabout two      months after plantingblooms begin to appear. The      spectacular yellow blossoms are quickly followed by small      nubs which-in turn-grow rapidly into several-inchlong pods      . . . pods that are susceptible to attack by bollworms,      corn earworms, cabbage loopers, and stinkbugs. (Blister      beetles and leaf beetles sometimes attack the plant's      foliage, but seldom the pods.) These pests can usually be      controlled by handpicking ... but if insect infestation      becomes heavy you may wish to dust with rotenone. (Before      dusting, remove all pods . . . even the nubs.)    </p>    <p>      To be truthful, though, garden pests don't really bother      okra very often. In fact, okra that's been grown in rich      soil and cared for by organic methods seldom attracts many      harmful insects at all. A far bigger "problem" than insects      is how to harvest and make use of the plants' prodigious      yield of pods!    </p>    <p>      Because the nubs grow so rapidly-and because the pods      quickly become woody if they're allowed to stay on the      plantokra must be harvested at least every other day. (Cut      the pods free of the main plant with a sharp knife.) We      harvest all pods every 48 hours, leaving only the nubs to      develop further.    </p>    <p>      In the kitchen, okra pods require immediate attention,      since they tend to become fibrous even after they've been      picked. The first order of business then is to cut the stem      off each pod, being careful not to slice into the pod      itself and allow juice to escape. The small pods may be      boiled whole, seasoned, and served as a side dish. The      larger pods (which can be stored in a moist, cool place for      use the following day) can either be sliced and put into      soup or stew . . . or sliced, breaded with cornmeal, and      fried till crisp.    </p>    <p>      If the crop gets ahead of you (and it probably will), there      are several ways to preserve okra. The easiest way is      simply to freeze it. Blanch the whole, small pods for about      three minutes . . . then pack 'em into containers. sea! the      containers up, and store them in the freezer. (If you wind      up with one partly filled container, set it in the freezer      and finish filling it at the next picking.)    </p>    <p>      Another way to keep okra is to cook it up into a batch of      "okra soup", a favorite Southern staple for the pantry.      (This is an especially good way to dispose of large pods.)      In a big kettle, combine tomatoes, thick slices of okra,      and corn and/or baby lima beans, in whatever proportions      you wish. Add a teaspoon of salt per quart of soup, and a      few sliced onions if desired. Cook till the vegetables are      tender, pour into sterilized jars, and seal. This soup      makes a tasty accompaniment to rice . . . and-with the      addition of meat stock and potatoes, noodles, or rice-it      becomes a hearty main dish itself. (Serve the soup with      plenty of unsweetened cornbread, if you wish to maintain      the Southern tradition.)    </p>    <p>      A third way to deal with an okra surplus is to pickle the      pods. Substitute okra for beans in your favorite "dilly      bean" recipe ... combine the pods with pickled hot peppers      ... or use the following recipe: Pack three and a half      pounds of okra into hot, sterilized jars. Make a brine      consisting of one pint of white distilled vinegar, one      quart of water, one-third cup of salt, and two teaspoons of      dill seed. Bring the brine to a boil, then pour the hot      solution over the okra, leaving 112" of air space in the      lop of each jar. Finally, seal the jars, process them for      10 minutes in a boiling water bath, and store them for      several weeks before opening.    </p>    <p>      Then too, you can always dry your okra. This method of      preservation does cut okra's Vitamin A content in half, but      it leaves intact appreciable amounts of calcium,      phosphorus, and iron. Dried okra seeds can be shelled and      cooked like dried beans or peas . . . or they can even be      ground up and used as a coffee substitute.    </p>    <p>      Good flavor, good nutrition, tremendous yields, and      spectacular flowers ... you get it all when you grow      Hibiscus esculentus (plain ole okra), whether you live in      Michigan or Louisiana, or somewhere in between!    </p>    <hr />
