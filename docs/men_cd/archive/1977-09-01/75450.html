R.F.T.    </p>    <p>      IF THE paint is very fresh hot, soapy water will usually      wash it all off. A soft brush will assist in the removal.      If paint is dried on it is much harder to remove. Ii such      is the case try soaking the stain with turpentine. Patience      and time will be required for this, and again the soft      brush will help. A still older and dried stain means that      there must be a softening of the paint before it can be      removed. To soften it apply linseed oil. Turpentine should      next be applied to dissolve the paint.    </p>    <h3>      Blueberry Stains    </h3>    <p>      What wilt take blueberry stains off a new white silk gown?      E. S. AIX.    </p>    <p>      POUR lukewarm water through the spot, being careful to use      just as little water as possible. If one fears to pour the      water through lay a clean white cloth, folded in several      thicknesses, under the stain; then with a clean white cloth      over the end of the finger sponge the spot. Continue until      the spot is removed. A water ring is likely to follow,      because the new glaze of the silk has been injured. This      ring can be almost and usually entirelyremoved by steaming.      To (to this tie a piece of w white cloth over the spout of      the teakettle. Place about an inch of water in the kettle      and let boil hard. As the steam is forced out through the      cloth shake that part of the garment containing the water      ring in the steam. Continue until the fabric is evenly      moist, and then withdrawing it from the steam, shake until      dry. Sometimes the whole breadth containing the spot will      need to be steamed.    </p>    <h3>      Grasshopper Stains    </h3><p>What will remove grasshopper stains? C. F. J.</p>    <p>      GRASSHOI PER stains can often be removed with clear water.      This stain. like most other stains, is always easier to      remove when fresh. Soap will not set the stain, but is not      often needed.    </p>    <p>      Varnish on Linen    </p>    <p>      Is(? a bottle of aromatic spirits of ammonia on nay white      bureau cover. The cover stuck to the bureau, leaving a      great stain on the linen. How can this be removed? J, T ,J    </p>    <p>      REMOVE the varnish, which was the cause of this stain, by      some of the very substance which produced it. Varnish      dissolves in alcohol, so if you prefer, you may use clear      alcohol on the stain or a few drops of the aromatic spirits      of ammonia.    </p>    <h3>      Three Recipes For You    </h3>    <h3>      CINNAMON BUN    </h3>    <p>      1 cupful of milk    </p>    <p>      1 cupful of butter and lard    </p>    <p>      1 cupful of mater I yeast cake.    </p>    <p>      1 cupful of sugar 1 level teaspoonful salt    </p>    <p>      2 eggs    </p>    <p>      SCALD the milk and while it is hot pour it over the      shortening and the sugar, add the water, and when lukewarm      stir in the yeast cake tht has been well dissolved in half      a cupful of warm water. Add the salt and enough flour to      make a batter that will drop from a spoon. Beat it      thoroughly and stand it in a warm place overnight.    </p>    <p>      In the morning add the well-beaten eggs and enough flour to      make a soft dough. Knead lightly and well, put back into      the bowl and let rise until it doubles itself. Separate the      dough in half, and roll each half out in a thin sheet.      Spread this with soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, and      scatter over it some currants that have been washed and      dried. Roll in a long roll, and with a sharp knife cut off      buns about an inch in thickness. Place them flat in a      greased pan and stand them in a warm place until light.      Bake in a moderate oven about twenty minutes. If your.oven      is very hot on the bottom put the grate under them, as they      burn very readily.    </p>    <p>      If you like the buns very sticky make this mixture: Put one      tablespoonful of butter, half a cupful of brown sugar, half      a cupful of sirup or corn sirup and half a cupful of water      into a stewpan and boil until thick. Add currants to it.      When the buns are baked take them out of the pans, turn      them upside down, and spread this mixture evenly over the      bottoms and sides.    </p>    <h3>      ORANGE MARMALADE    </h3>    <p>      1 grapefruit    </p>    <p>      1 lemon    </p>    <p>      1 orange    </p>    <p>      Remove the core of grapefruit and the seeds of all fruit,      cut in pieces and put through a chopper. Add to the pulp      three times its bulk of water and stand away overnight.    </p>    <p>      On the second day boil ten minutes and stand away      overnight. On the third day to one pint of pulp add a pound      of sugar and boil an hour and fifteen minutes.    </p>    <h3>      BUTTERMILK PIE    </h3>    <p>      1 cupful of sugar I egg    </p>    <p>      1 tablespoonful of butter A pinch of salt    </p>    <p>      2 level tablespoonfuls of    </p>    <p>      2 cupfuls of buttermilk    </p>    <p>      flour    </p>    <p>      Flavoring to taste    </p>    <p>      Soften the butter a little, cream it with the sugar, add      the flour and mix again, then put in the salt and the egg,      unbeaten. Beat these ingredients very light, and add the      buttermilk and flavoring. Cook the mixture in a granite or      aluminum kettle and stir constantly till thick. Then pour      into a pie crust which has been previously cooked.    </p>    <p>      Or, line a large deep pie plate with pie paste, pierce      holes with a fork all over the bottom to prevent puffing,      pour the above mixture, uncooked, into this raw pie paste      and place in a moderate oven. Cook for twenty minutes or      until the mixture is set and a golden color on top.    </p>    <p>      A little grated coconut or a meringue may be spread on top      if desired.    </p>    <h3>      Stacks That Keep Grain    </h3>        <p>      WE HAVE a method of stacking in our neighborhood that keeps      our grain in splendid condition. We are able to stack green      oats, which everyone knows is very difficult to keep from      spoiling. We make our stacks oblong, in the form of ricks.      They contain from twelve to twenty loads. In harvesting the      grain we make a. big bundies as the binder will tie, so      that when stacked they average '300 to 2 10 bundles to the      ton.    </p>        <p>      We begin by making a sort of table on the ground in the      center of the spot where the stack is to be. We set posts      three feet long and four to six inches in diameter, one      foot into the ground and two feet apart. Crosspieces are      placed on top of these posts and rails are laid on these      crosspieces lengthwise of the rick. This rack in the center      of the stack gives splendid ventilation and prevents      heating. The stack is considerably larger than these racks,      and when it settles it reaches the ground all round.    </p>    <h3>      Good Money for Water    </h3>        <p>      WHEN my friend Sheldon decided to put an automatic pump and      a reservoir on his farm it was with the idea of adding a      convenience to his home. He did think that perhaps he might      run a line to the water trough in the barnyard, but his son      did not think that plan was best for the livestock-he      wanted it run right into the burn so that the cows could      have water before them all the time in individual buckets.      The work was done as an experiment.    </p>        <p>      One winter day the cows found that instead of wading out      through the snow to drink chilly water in the trough all      they had to do was to turn their heads to one side and get      all they desired. Better still, the water was at a      comfortable temperature; and instead of drinking just      enough for their absolute needs, as they had in the      barnyard, they drank their fill. Much to my friend's      surprise and his son's gratification the milk check from      his sixteen cows jumped seven dollars the first week, and      all during the winter the cows kept up their unusually high      standard.    </p>    <p>      Did it pay? Sheldon says the extra milk paid for the whole      outfit in less than one year, and before he would keep cows      again without the inside water system he'd sell the cows.      W. C. A.    </p>    <h3>      When Cream Won't Churn    </h3>        <p>      WHEN cream will not churn it may be infected with the wrong      form of bacteria. Often, especially during the summer,      certain forms of bacteria that get into the milk cause it      to become bitter before it really sours.    </p>    <p>      All pails, strainers and other milk utensils should be      boiled in a solution of alkali cleaning or sal soda.    </p>    <p>      When the crearn is churned it should be warmed to seventy      degrees and a quart of freshly soured milk added. This will      give the right organism, and if held at a temperature of      seventy degrees the action will he rapid and should give      much better flavored butter than where the cream is held on      ice until ready to churn. After the cream reaches the      proper degree of acidity cool it to sixty degrees and hold      for at least an hour before churning. G.
