Cole and Charles Wing.</strong></p><p>Every individual should design, build, and decorate his or her own unique, highly personalized dwelling. Ridiculous? Impossible? Not so, say authors John N. Cole (editor of The Maine Times) and Charles Wing (a founder of The Shelter Institute in Bath, Maine), who've compiled an excellent layperson's guie to the engineering of a permanent, energyefficient home. Cole and Wing cover all options available to the owner bullder in the areas of site selection, foundation types, lumber choice. framing, roofing, heating. wiring, and plumbing, and bring an extraordinary number of tables, charts, and figures to bear in their presentation. (The authors put forth an especially well-documented assessment of the performance potential of passively solarheated houses.) You'll want to keep this largeformat paperback right next to Ken Kern's books on your reference shelf. 244 pages. 64067$7.95</p><h3>THE SOLAR HOME BOOK</h3><p><strong>by Bruce Anderson with Michael Riordan.</strong></p><p>A thorough introduction and guide to the residential uses of solar energy. All the residential uses: the heating and cooling of living space, the heating of household water. the generation of electricity . . . you name it and it's here. You want big projects? How about the more than 40 examples of solar-heated and cooled houses and buildings in this manual. Small projects? The book also contains cutaways and other instructions for the renovation of existing buildings, fabrication of greenhouses, even the construction and use of water heaters that almost anyone anywhere can build. Low-cost aspects of the use of the sun? That's emphasized on all the projects described in this guide. Theory? There's lots of it here . . . and all in an easy to digest presentation that's amazingly jargon-free without sacrificing content, clarity, or detail in any way. Home owners, tradespeople, and designers are all gonna love this one. This book is all you really need to design and successfully operate a solar-heated and/or -cooled dwelling anywhere on the planet's surface that such a building can be built and operated. And the more than 100 straightforward diagrams and more than 60 photographs and drawings make everything in THE SOLAR HOME BOOK a snap to understand. 297 pages. Paper back. 83001 $7.50</p><h3>DESIGNING & BUILDING A SOLAR HOUSE</h3><p><strong>by Donald Watson</strong></p><p>The author of this dandy handbook really knows his stuff. He's been a solar project consultant to the United Nations and the U.S. Department of Housing. Don Watson is also a practicing architect who has built his own solar home and designed 60 other solar-heated or-tempered dwellings. Watson's aim with this book, he says, "is to make a complex subject both interesting and easy to understand". And that he does! Active systems, passive systems, Eco Design (how to design a building for maximum energy conservation), airflow through a house, site planning, types of heat exchange systems . . . it's all here and-the way Don presents h it's all good! As a matter of fact, the resource information in the back of the book-lists of solar houses throughout the country, accompanying photographs, sources of solar heating equipment, and solar design calculations, cost comparisons, and performance data-alone is worth the price of this manual. 281 pages. Paperback. 83003 $8.95</p><h3>HAND-HEWN: THE ART OF BUILDING YOUR OWN CABIN</h3><p><strong>by William C. Leitch.</strong></p><p>This book's main purpose is simply to help the novice fully understand (and appreciate) the concepts behind log construction, the architectural options available to the builder, andfinally-the actual process of erecting such a structure. Unlike most, however, HANDHEWN doesn't purport to be the definitive work on the subject. Instead, the author honestly advises his readers to seek additional sources of information, and-in fact-reviews a number of such volumes to make the choice just that much easier. The text covers and clarifies points that previous works either skip over entirely or explain inadequately (HANDHEWN's section on notching logs is the best we've ever seen), and discusses both the aesthetics and mechanics of land buying and use, planning, living in the mountains, and employing the right tools for the right jobs. A truly remarkable photo-illustrated book, and a "must" if you're thinking about forging .a home in the wilderness. 122 pages. Paperback. 69001 $4.95</p><h3>BACKYARD LIVESTOCK: HOW TO GROW MEAT FOR YOUR FAMILY</h3><p><strong>by Steven Thomas.</strong></p><p>This tight, concise, and well-illustrated handbook contains enough information to get anyone started raising their own poultry, rabbits, sheep, goats, pigs, and veal .. . right in his or her own back yard! The care of each animal discussed is thoroughly detailed and the book contains treatments of subjects related to the small-scale production of meat animals: the tanning of hides, how to give an injection, the raising of grains for livestock feed, etc. This is certainly not an exhaustive animal husbandry guide . . . but it is an extremely handy introduction to the subject for the beginner. 264 pages. Paperback. 71019$5.95</p><h3>HOW TO BUILD AND FURNISH A LOG CABIN</h3><p><strong>by W. Ben Hunt.</strong></p><p>Mr. Hunt, a lifelong outdoorsman who would be about 90 if he were still living wrote two books on log cabin construction in 1939 and 1947. Both are reprinted in this unusual work on the building of a backwoods home (including chimney and fireplace) with hand tools only. Many excellent drawings and photographs illustrate the process step by step. The second part of the guide contains a wealth of handsome designs for rustic furniture ... also for fences, bridges, signposts, and other out door structures.166 pages. Paperback. 69009 $3.95</p><h3>THE ALMANAC OF RURAL LIVING</h3><p><strong>by Harvey C. Neese.</strong></p><p>Absolutely amazing! We can't even begin to list all the information that's packed into this incredible, almost encyclopedic guide. But just to give you an idea, here are a few sample sections: agronomy (soil chemistry,composting, irrigation, and water-supply systems); hor ticulture (raising fruits and vegetables, grafting and budding, using fertilizers and soil neutralizers); pest control (insects, the plants they favor, the substances-both natural and man-made-used to combat them); animal husbandry (cattle, goats, swine, poultry); veterinary medicine (immunology, injection procedures, livestock, feeding); home industry (foraging, tanning, food storage, weaving, making soap, candles); self-help engineering (plans and instructions for constructing outbuildings and farm and home equipment); health (basic hygiene, first aid, midwifery); and charts and tables (measurements, conversions. "farm figuring", and knot tying illustrations). A real workhorse of a book! 483 pages. Paperback. 70030 $6.95</p><h3>NEW AGE VEGETARIAN COOKBOOK</h3><p><strong>by the Rosicrucian Fellowship.</strong></p><p>The most complete vegetarian cookbook we've found. Includes food values, menu suggestions, canning, preserving, freezing, use of herbs, and lots of good, sensible recipes. 492 pages. 74057$4.50</p><h3>OTHER HOMES AND GARBAGE: DESIGNS FOR SELF SUFFICIENT LIVING</h3><p><strong>by Jim Leckie, Gil Masters, Harry Whitehouse, and Lily Young.</strong></p><p>A good many books on "self-sufficient living systems" have been published in recent years, but-for some reason-most either fail to provide enough technological know-how (the "Mickey Mouse approach) or include so much scientific jargon (the "new Einstein" complex) as to make them in comprehensible to the everyday layman. OTHER HOMES AND GARBAGE, however, hits the "alternatives" nail squarely on the head. Put together by four engineers from Stanford, the book covers alternative architecture, small-scale generation of electricity. solar heating principles, waste handling and water supply systems, and agriculture and aquaculture . . . and explains each subject in realistically technical (but entirely understandable) terms. The result is a reference work that goes well beyond the point of philosophy and theory to encompass (hurrah!) the realm of practical application. Charts. tables, facts. figures, and just darned good writing make OTHER HOMES AND GARBAGE a superb primer for the alternatives enthusiast. 302 pages. Large paperback. 70024 $9.95</p><h3>THE SURVIVAL GREENHOUSE</h3><p><strong>by James B. DeKorne.</strong></p><p>Readers of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>' will recognize this author as the enterprising fellow who's built a selfcontained food production unit-an underground hydroponic greenhouse and aquaculture tank-that's powered by the wind, heated by the sun, and fed on compost. And this book is a report on Mr. DeKorne's efforts . . his successes and failures. trials and triumphs. More important, however, THE SURVIVAL GREEN HOUSE explains how you can duplicate the writer's work, and provides complete information on installing a wind generator and solar collectors, formulating organic hydroponic solutions, and-in general-managing the production of both fish and vegetables in your own back yard. Many illustrations. charts, and tables round out this definitive work. 165 pages. Paperback. 72005$7.50</p>
