                    <h5 id="byline">      by BOB QUARTERONI    </h5>    <hr />        <p>      "It is a bad soil where no flowers will grow," said Thomas      Fuller in 1732. Working on that premise, the U.S.      Department of Agriculture has "domesticated" three      grow-anywhere prairie wildflowers (see photos above) and      begun selling certified seed to commercial growers (see      addresses below). The good news for gardeners is that      beginning this fall, these growers will offer the      wildflower seeds to the general public for the first time.    </p>    <p>      The three wildflowers in questionmysteriously named Kaneb,      Eureka, and Nekan--were selected by the USDA after ten      years of testing, primarily for the plants' ability to      control soil erosion and (at the same time) beautify      pastures, rangelands, and roadsides. Each one is hardy,      easy to grow, and-in general-perfectly suited to gardening.    </p>        <p>      The first plant-Kaneb, a purple prairie clover-looks like a      cross between a thistle and a cattail. Like its stylish      cou. sin the peanut, Kaneb is a legume: it takes its      nitrogen from the air and thus grows well In nitrogen-poor      soils. Animals can graze Kaneb without harm, and the plant      is said to withstand extremes of temperature and moisture      well.    </p>    <p>      If you like lavender, you'll love Eureka. This wildflower-a      lovely lavender gayfeather that requires no maintenance and      can grow up to five feet tall -was developed to beautify      highways, but it can easily be adapted to home gardens,      driveways, fences, etc.    </p>        <p>      Nakan--a pitcher sage that the USDA has recently      domesticated-is actually a mint with woolly foliage and      large, white flowers. It's said to be capable of      strengthening prairie grazing land, serving as forage for      large and small stock, and acting as a breath freshener for      cows.    </p>    <p>      Wildflowers (the above three especially) are easy to grow.      Just remember:    </p>    <p>      [1] No cultivating. (If weeding is necessary, do it by      hand.)    </p>    <p>      [2] No herbicides.    </p>    <p>      [3] No chemical fertilizers. (Compost works much better.)    </p>    <p>      [4] Always cover the bare earth around wildflowers with      mulch . . . at least until the plants are well established.    </p>    <p>      For information on how to order the above wildflower      varieties, contact Stock Seed Farms, Inc., RR 1, Box 112,      Murdock, Neb. 68407, or Sharp Brothers Seed Co., Box 140,      Healy, Kan. 76850 . . . and enclose a little something to      cover the cost of a reply.    </p>    <hr />
