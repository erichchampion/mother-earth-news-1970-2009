                    <h5 id="byline">     by GORDON SOLBERG    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>It's certainly not news that the past summer was an      exceptionally dry one in many parts of the country</em>      <em>... so dry that a great many back-to-thel-anders lost      all or a portion of the hay they intended to feed their      livestock during the coming winter. What is news to a lot      of folks, though, is that there still are at least three      possible shoestring ways for you to provide forage for your      goats, cows, and other beasts during the cold months ahead      ... even if your summer crop of hay did burn out in the      drought.</em>    </p>        <p>      For some time now, I've been feeding my goats baled hay      that I've "bought" with honey . .. simply because it's a      lot easier for me to produce honey than hay, and three      pounds of my homestead sweetener buys a 75-pound bale      (enough dried vegetation to feed one goat for a couple of      weeks). "Why should I bother to make my own hay?" I've      always said to myself.    </p>    <p>      Always-that is-until last summer, when I started thinking:      What would I do if the local hay supply suddenly dried up?      Could I make my own? How much of a hassle would it be?      Being a firm believer in contingency planning, I decided to      answer these questions once and for all. In the process of      answering them, I came up with three highly satisfactory      alternatives to boughten fodder: willow hay. weed hay, and      winter pasture.    </p>    <h3>      WILLOW HAY    </h3>    <p>      Willow is an excellent forage crop: All kinds of      animals-goats, cattle, beavers, etc-love it. Unlike grass,      clover, and other hay crops-which become woody and      unpalatable after they bloom-willow blooms in early spring,      then spends the rest of the summer sending out succulent      new growth.    </p>        <p>      It so happened that I knew of an excellent foraging spot      where-several years ago-my father had bulldozed a road      through a willow grove that'd grown up alongside a river.      To keep the weedlike trees from completely engulfing the      path, Dad had resorted to spraying the cleared area with      herbicide several times each summer. Aha! I saw the perfect      opportunity to do a good deed for my dad, my goats, and the      environment . . . all at once.    </p>    <p>      "If you'll refrain from spraying this year," I told my      father, "I'll clear your road of willows at the end of the      summer."    </p>        <p>      Dad took me up on my offer and-come August-I found his road      lined with 8'-tall willow shoots. Could I harvest them?      There was an easy way to find out: I sharpened my hatchet,      waded into the cool, shady thicket, and started chopping.    </p>    <p>      The work went quickly. (The cool shade, nearby singing      birds, and gurgling water helped a lot.) All I did was      kneel down, grab as many shoots in one hand as I could, and      slice away. Each swipe brought down a sizable portion of      foliage, which I then piled to one side as I went along.      (Beats the old swing-the-scythe-in-the-pasture routine any      day!)    </p>    <p>      Whenever I got tired of chopping, I combined the piles of      fresh-cut willow at my side, hefted the foliage onto my      back,    </p>    <p>      and carried the load to a goat-free pasture, where I laid      the stalks out to dry in the sun. After a couple days, it      was a simple task to carry the dried vegetation (which -by      then-weighed only a small fraction of what it had weighed      originally) to a shed for storage.    </p>        <p>      The goats had a feast! They eagerly consumed all the leaves      (of course) and the top halves of the stalks, leaving just      the woody butts behind. Eight hours' work (spread out over      a week or so of cold mornings) had produced a two-week      supply of hay for my three goats . . . a pretty good deal,      if you ask me. Not that I relish the thought of gathering a      whole winter's supply of hay this way ... I don't. But I      <em>could do</em> it if I had to. And that's what I wanted      to know in the first place.    </p>    <h3>      WEED HAY    </h3>    <p>      Another excellent source of free hay, I've found, is the      tall-growing annual weeds (such as amaranth,      lamb's-quarters, and wild sunflower). I let these      "volunteer feedstuffs" grow up good and tall, then-after a      hard rain softens the ground-yank the plants out by the      roots and lay 'em in a sunny spot to dry before passing      them on to my caprine friends.    </p>    <p>      It's best to harvest as many of these weeds as you can,      because of the way they shrink as they dry. (Believe it or      not, an enormous 6'-tall amaranth-when dried-will occupy a      hungry goat for only about five minutes!)    </p>    <h3>      WINTER PASTURE    </h3>        <p>      The least expensive and easiest-to-provide hay substitute      of all, of course, is winter pasture. The main requirements      here are [1] plenty of grazing area (the more the better,      since grass grows slowly -if at all-during the cold months)      and [2] a mild winter climate.    </p>    <p>      The trick is to set aside a large pasture during late      summer, fertilize the area heavily, and let it grow thick      and lush during the cool, damp days of fall. Then-in early      winter, after the other pastures have begun to thin out-you      can turn your beasts loose in their special winter grazing      area. Providing you've let the grass grow good and thick,      your animals will graze on the pasturage well into the      winter (even after the grass has turned brown and dry from      the cold). If the field is big enough-and your animals few      enoughthe beasts will still be working on it by the time      spring rolls around.    </p>    <p>      This method of feeding livestock worked exceedingly well      for us several years ago, when we were living in the      Missouri Ozarks. Once, in fact, we wintered four goats this      way clear to spring on only three bales of supplemental      hay! Our nannies remained perfectly healthy the whole time,      and all gave birth to twins the following spring.    </p>    <h3>      IN CONCLUSION    </h3>    <p>      It seems to me that with a little work and advance      planning, almost any homesteader who wants to can easily      supply his livestock with all the winter forage they need,      even in an exceptionally dry year, without buying (or      bartering trade goods for) baled hay. It's certainly a good      feeling to know (as I do) that even if you have to make do      with willow and weed hay, you can. And, considering how dry      it's been over much of the country this past summer, that's      valuable knowledge to have.    </p>    <hr />
