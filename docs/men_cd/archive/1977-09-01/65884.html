                    <h5 id="byline">      by RICHARD P.KING    </h5>    <p>      <strong>Cut your gardening costs! Become more food      self-sufficient! Create new varieties of vegetables that      grow best right in your own (and nobody else's) back yard!      And have a lot of fun in the process.</strong>    </p>        <p>      One gardening encyclopedia tells its readers not to save      seeds since they're so plentiful and inexpensive that it's      not worth the bother. Oh yeah? Take a careful look at your      colorful new seed catalogs . . . and then tell me that      seeds aren't expensive. Until recently, my yearly order      cost between $20 and $25 . . . and I suspect my case is not      unusual.    </p>    <p>      It's not necessary, though, to spend $20 or $10-or even      $5.00-each year on seeds. I've found that by saving seeds      from my own garden and then planting them the following      year, I've been able to cut my annual seed bill in <em>half      . . .</em> despite the fact that the few seeds I do buy      have risen sharply in price, and despite the fact that I      like to experiment with exotic (and generally expensive)      plant varieties. If you have a comparatively large      garden-or if you can discipline yourself to resist those      glowing seed catalog pictures and descriptions (something I      haven't entirely been able to do)-you could easily save      even more on your seed bill.    </p>    <p>      This year, then, why not plan to collect, store, and use      some of the seed your own garden gives you for free? It      isn't hard to do . . . and the rewards (if you ask me) more      than justify the small amount of effort involved.    </p>        <h3>      FIRST, A FEW BASICS    </h3>    <p>      Before we get into the actual "here's !sow" of preserving      seeds, I'd like to offer a few observations that could save      you a good deal of frustration and-possibly -      disappointment.    </p>    <p>      First of all, <em>hybrid varieties</em> (you'll see the      word "hybrid" in the seed catalog description or in the      vegetable's name) do not always breed true to type. Thus,      the seed from last season's mammoth tomatoes may only      produce scraggly plants bearing tiny red buttons next      season. To avoid this problem, always start with standard      (i.e., non-hybrid) vegetable varieties, or else stick with      hybrids that you know will breed true.    </p>    <p>      Second, if you plant two or more standard varieties of corn      (or squash or tomatoes, or any of the flowering vegetables)      you're likely to have crosspollination by wind and/or      insects, leading to seed of uncertain quality. (Of course,      the resulting hybrid you end up with may turn out to be of      higher quality than the two varieties with which you      started . . . but that's highly unlikely.) You can-and      shouldminimize crossfertilization by planting only one      variety of corn (or squash, tomato, etc.) at a time and      locating your plot as far as possible from your neighbor's      patch.    </p>    <p>      Third, keep in mind that many common vegetables (the root      crops, cabbages, parsley, and brussels sprouts) are      biennial . . . that is, they don't form seed pods until the      second year. Here in Minnesota, such vegetables have to be      mighty hardy to survive an entire winter in the ground.      (Beets, for instance, aren't that hardy and-as a result-I'm      obliged to purchase new beet seeds each year.) I always      leave a few carrots in the garden over the winter months,      however, since carrots are by nature cold-resistant. The      following spring, they produce tops that grow about two      feet tall, then send out white flowers that resemble Queen      Anne's lace (the wild plant from which carrots were      originally developed). Eventually, tiny seeds form and you      can collect them.    </p>	<h3>	WHEN AND HOW TO COLLECT AND LABEL SEEDS</h3>        <p>      Pick fleshy vegetables (such as tomatoes, squash, and      melons) when they're fully ripe, then scoop out their seeds      an spread them to dry in a well-ventilate place. Beans and      peas need only be left on the vine until the pods are dry      an crackly. Corn, likewise, should be left t dry on the      stalk until the kernels dent. Other types of seed may be      gathere when they're fully formed, hard, an filled with      "meat". Remember to collect seeds only fro the most      vigorous plants in you garden, and not just from the first      fe ripe specimens you happen to encounter. By selecting      seeds from just the healthiest plants, you'll be able-ove      time-to create special sub-varieties o these crops that are      especially well adapted to your particular climate and      soil.    </p>    <p>      Also remember to label and stor your free bonanza as soon      as possibl after harvesting. You may think you'll be able      to recall the name of each kin of seed, but believe me-it's      easy t get confused. Some (those for broccoli cabbage, and      cauliflower, for instance resemble one another quite      closely.    </p>        <p>      Regular correspondence-size envelopes make good containers      for storin small quantities of most kinds of seed since      they can be sealed and labele quite conveniently. For      larger quantities, I use glass jars. (They take up more      space than envelopes and are break able, but you can see      inside them.)<br />    </p>    <p>      To label the seed, I write the name of each kind of      vegetable, the particular variety, where and when I      originally bought the seed, and the month and year of      harvest on the outside of each container. Example: Bush      snap beans -Blue Lake-Park's (1970)-August 1976.    </p>        <h3>      THE KEY TO SUCCESSFUL SEED STORAGE    </h3>    <p>      The key to successful long-term seed storage is keeping      your c ache cool and dry. If you store your seeds where the      air is moist, they may sprout and/or become mildewed. (Tip:      You may want to put a small amount of powdered milk into      each storage container to act as a desiccant.) Likewise,      mold growth occurs at a faster rate in warm air than it      does in cool air.    </p>    <p>      Potato and onion sets may be stored in open boxes or hung      in mesh bags in a place where the temperature is 35° to      40°F and the air is not overly dry. We store ours in a      frost-free fruit cellar along with our canned goods and      winter squash. (My neighbor, on the other hand, has had      good luck squirreling away his eatin' spuds and seeds in a      fourfoot-deep pit dug in a sandy, welldrained spot. When he      unearths them in early May, the potatoes and seeds look      just like they did the previous September . . . and not a      single sprout!)    </p>    <h3>      HOW LONG WILL SEEDS KEEP?    </h3>    <p>      Some seeds keep much longer than others. The following      chart will give you an idea as to the minimum length of      time properly stored seeds will remain viable. <strong>TYPE      OF SEED</strong> <strong>USEFUL LIFE (YEARS)</strong>    </p>		    <p>      Some of the above seeds may-depending on the particular      variety and the storage conditions-remain usable for up to      ten years . . . although, of course, you shouldn't depend      on such extraordinary viability.    </p>    <h3>      HOW YOU CAN TELL IF YOUR SEEDS ARE STILL ALIVE    </h3>    <p>      Years ago, I helped carry out germination tests for a large      store that bought seed in bulk and repacked it in small      packets for resale. Since the manager carried his unsold      stock over from year to year, it was important for us to      know how many seeds in a particular batch would sprout when      planted.    </p>    <p>      Here's what we did: First, we placed moistened cotton in a      petri dish . . . then we    </p>    <p>      [1] put exactly 100 seeds on top of the damp cotton,    </p>    <p>      [2] covered the dish,    </p>    <p>      [3] left it at room temperature for a certain number of      days, and    </p>    <p>      [4] counted the number of seeds that had begun to grow. If      90 out of 100 seeds sprouted, the germination rate was      listed as 90%. This was considered good.    </p>    <p>      I do essentially the same thing with my seeds now, except      that I only use ten seeds per test, and I only test seeds      that are more than a year old. (If the seeds are less than      two years old and look good, I assume that their      germination rate is acceptably high.)    </p>    <p>      Any plastic or glass container that'll hold a damp blotter,      damp newspaper, or moistened cotton (along with the seeds)      will work as well as a petri plate. Just remember to label      your containers with the date of the test and the variety      of seed being tested. Then-after a week or so-check them.      If eight out of ten seeds in any given test sprout, you can      assume the germination rate to be 80% (which is, of course,      plenty good).    </p>    <h3>      PUT YOUR SEEDS TO WORK!    </h3>    <p>      Homegrown seeds have many uses, in addition to serving as      the source of next year's garden vegetables. Pumpkin and      squash seeds, for instance, are extremely tasty and      nutritious when roasted. (My wifewho's spent three years in      Turkey-tells me the people in that country eat squash seeds      the way we gobble peanuts.) Dried peas make good pigeon      food, if you're into raising squabs (although it does take      rather a lot of peas to do the job). In addition, many      seeds have attractive shapes and colors that make them fun      to use in craft projects. Last year, I was only a little      saddened to see my future zucchini patch end up as a wall      plaque!    </p>    <p>      Why not give seed-saving a try? You'll not only gain a new      source of highquality protein (and/or craft materials), but      you'll reduce-perhaps drastically-your yearly gardening      outlay of cash. And-more important-you'll have the      satisfaction of knowing that you're a little bit less      dependent on someone else for the food on your table.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      Note: For more information on the collection and storage of      garden seed, be sure to read Clarice L.
