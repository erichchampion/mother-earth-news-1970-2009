                    <h2 id="subtitle">      (THE HOTTEST CURVE KNOWN)    </h2>    <hr />    <p>      Solar energy is in! All the way in ... as a quick glance at      almost any magazine, newspaper, or evening television news.      cast will demonstrate. Everyone, it seems, is now      interested in substituting some of the boundless energy      from the sun for our increasingly expensive fossil fuels.    </p>    <p>      And that's relatively easy to do for a few fortunate folks      . . . the ones with enough bucks in their bank account to      just go out and buy the "latest and greatest" solar energy      hardware on the market.    </p>    <p>      Most of us, however, have more ambition than money. In      short, if we expect to harness the sun for our own personal      use any time soon, we're probably going to have to go down      into the basement or out into the workshop and build our      own hardware. Which is where the rub all too frequently      comes in: Far too many would-be constructors of      do-it-yourself solar equipment are ready, willing, and able      to fabricate the gear they want ... but they simply don't      know where or how to begin .. . especially when it comes to      one of the most efficient solar collection devices of all,      the parabolic curve.    </p>    <p>      Ah, but that's exactly where I can be of help. I've been      calculating, constructing, and working with parabolic      curves for years and I've come to the conclusion that it's      no wonder parabolics baffle so many would-be solar energy      experimenters: The amount of downright false and misleading      information about them currently in circulation is      appalling.    </p>    <p>      Suppose, for instance, that you desire to create a      parabolic mirror, or half-mirror, or extended half-curve of      rectangular shape (see Fig. 1). You know you need to      calculate and draw the supports and surface for the mirror      you want . . . but that's about all you know. So you begin      to look around and-hot dog!-you discover an article or an      advertisement or some other piece of literature which      glibly leads you to believe that almost any old curve will      do the job.    </p>    <p>      Do not be fooled by such misinformation! A parabolic curve      is the only curve that will collect the sun's rays over a      broad surface and then-under conditions of ideal      efficiency-direct all those rays to a single given spot or      surface. No other curve or shape will do this. For maximum      efficiency and maximum focus, your curve must be parabolic.    </p>    <p>      As an example of the misstatements I refer to, 1 direct      your attention to George Salmon's works on conics, higher      plane curves, analytic geometry, and higher algebra . . .      which are considered to be standard authorities in the      field by many knowledgeable experts. Yet, on page 199 of      Salmon's Treatise on Conic Sections (6th Edition, Dover),      Article 209 states that " . . . If we suppose one vertex      and focus of an ellipse given, while its axis major      increases without limit, the curve will ultimately become a      parabola." THIS IS NOT TRUE! 1 also refer you to Article      214 on page 202 of the same book: " . . . and we shall      show, in the present section, that a parabola may in every      respect be considered as an ellipse, having one of its foci      at this distance and the other at infinity." Again, NOT      TRUE!    </p>    <p>      The following, however, IS true and is-I believe-described      in the simplest way possible, while retaining all the      accuracy of an exercise done by a licensed civil engineer.    </p>    <p>      Given: the focal length only. This can be any distance you      want to work with and is nothing but the distance from the      back of your planned curvature (see Fig. 2)-at the      center-to the focus (the spot where the heat is to be      directed). Let's say you've decided to use a focal length      of four feet. A completed parabolic curve, across the      focus, will have a diameter four times that focal length      or, in this case, a diameter of 16 feet (4 X 4). A      half-curve, then, will have a height of eight feet . . .      and here's an easy way to seek that halfcurve:    </p>    <p>      Draw the focal line out to its required length on a large      sheet of smooth paper (Kraft building paper is fine). Fig.      3 shows this focal length-Of-on the sheet of paper. It also      shows a second line-fPdrawn at right angles to and twice as      long (eight feet) as Of.    </p>    <p>      We know, of course, that the parabolic curve we're seeking      will run, in some fashion, between points 0 and P. And,      although we have a rough idea of the area in which that      curve will fall, we're not yet sure of its exact course. So      we're ready to get down to the finer definition of our      curve, and we're going to begin that definition by drawing      in a number of lines that are parallel to fP and spaced one      inch apart (see Fig. 4). These lines need be put in only in      the near vicinity of where our final curve must lie, but      they should be measured and drawn accurately. You will,      when finished with this step, have a total (counting iP) of      48 parallel lines drawn on your sheet of paper.    </p>    <p>      Now (Fig. 5) find an accurate straightedge that is at least      twice as long as the focal length Of (or, to put it another      way, at least as long as fP). Place the corner of one end      of the straightedge precisely on point f and-taking care to      keep that corner exactly on frotate the face of the      straightedge from Of down to fP. As you touch each of the      48 parallel lines from the top down, add one inch to the      length (48 inches) of Of and make a dot. (The first dot      will be made on the first parallel line down and 49 inches      from f, the second dot will be on the second parallel line      down and 50 inches from f, etc.) Continue on until you      scribe your last dot on the bottom line and 96 inches from      f. The series of dots you've just made will define a      parabolic curve with a four-foot focal length.    </p>    <p>      Now connect the dots by very accurately placing a flexible      metal, plastic, or wooden strip across them and carefully      draw. ing a line from O-cutting through all the scribed      points in between-to P (Fig. 6).    </p>    <p>      This completed line is the curve you seek. It is NOT part      of an ellipse. It is NOT part of a circle. It is NOT a      hyperbolic. It is a true parabolic curve and you can now      use it in the construction of your solar heating unit or      cooker. By doubling the drawn curve back over the focal      line (pick up point P, swing it over Of, and lay it down      again an fP distance on the other side of Of), you can      quickly and easily convert the eight-foot-long half-curve      you've just drawn into a 16-foot-long full curve. When the      focal line of this true parabolic curve is pointed      precisely at the sun, ALL the Incoming solar rays which      strike the curve and are reflected will focus at f . . .      and, believe me, it gets HOT.    </p>    <p>      OK. Now for some variations. Suppose, for instance, that      you want to construct a parabolic reflector which has the      same focal length (four feet) of the curve we've just drawn      . . . but a smaller diameter. Easy. Starting at the base      line fp, just measure up as far as you like, slice off the      bottom of the drawing, and keep the rest. (If you cut your      drawing as shown in Fig. 7, the remaining portion of the      curve can be used to build a collector much like the one      shown in Fig. 1a.)    </p>    <p>      It's a little more complicated-but not really much more      difficult-to extend a parabolic "dish" out to some endless      dimension . . . while still retaining a specific focal      length.    </p>    <p>      Using the focal length Of as one (1) unit, lay off on the      extended line, OX, ANY number of unit lengths that you      want. (See Fig. 8 in which, as you'll note, we've tilted      our original-Figs. 3 through 7parabolic drawing 90Â° to      the left to give us plenty of drawing space.)    </p>    <p>      If you'll look at Figs. 8 and 9 you'll note that at the end      of each consecutive odd number on line OX, the next      vertical line will always be the next EVEN number above the      odd . . . while all the inbetween numbers will be      fractional. (Example: The first odd numberl-on the base      line is followed by a vertical line labeled 2. The second      odd number-3-on the base line is followed by a vertical      line labeled 4. And so on. And the vertical lines in      between 2 and 4-2.82842 and 3.4641-are fractional.)    </p>    <p>      All right. Note also that the evenly numbered vertical      lines (2, 4, 6, etc.)--the ones which separate the      odd-numbered unit measurements (1, 3, 5, etc.)--are each      longer than the preceding evenly numbered vertical line by      the square root of 4 (the square root of 4 is 2, and      vertical line 4 is 2 longer than vertical line 2, while      vertical line 6 is 2 longer than vertical line 4, etc.).    </p>    <p>      If you'll study Fig. 9, you'll further note that the      squares of each vertical line (both evenly numbered and      fractional) form a very neat sequence, in which each square      advances by exactly 4. (That Is: The square of vertical      line 2 is 4, the square of vertical line 2.82842 is 8, the      square of vertical line 3.4641 is 12, etc.)    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, if you're familiar with right triangles,      you've probably already noticed that the hypotenuses beyond      f also form a series, each one greater than the last by 1.      (That Is: The hypotenuse-shown as a dotted line-of the      triangle running from f along OX to vertical line 2.82842,      up that vertical line and back down to f . . . is 3. The      hypotenuse-again shown as a dotted line-of the triangle      running from 1 along OX to vertical line 3.4641, up that      vertical line and back down to f . . . Is 4. And so on.)    </p>    <p>      By computing and plotting out the squares for the vertical      lines involved, then, you will have the precise distances      from the base line to the curvature for a parabolic curve      extending as many units out as you care to take it.    </p>    <p>      It's also very easy to double check any of these      computations, since every right triangle within the curve      will have a hypotenuse two units greater than its base.      (That Is: Point A in Fig. 9 is a total of 7 units from f      and is located at the base of a vertical line measuring      5.65685 units. Seven times seven equals 49 and 5.65685      squared is 32. Forty-nine plus 32 equals 81 and 9-which is      two units greater than 7-is the root of 81.)    </p>    <p>      This order of numbers is a constant factor to any parabola.      Or, to put it another way, should you want a parabola of      ANY measurement, you have only to multiply or divide by the      necessary number to obtain the new dimensions. (Example: I      want a parabola with a focus of seven feet and I know that      every number above was calculated with the focal length Of      given as one (1) unit. Therefore, all I have to do to      figure those same numbers for a focal length of seven feet      is multiply by seven. And if I don't want feet, I can just      as easily convert those numbers to meters, miles, or      anything else I do want. The ratio will always be the      same.)    </p>    <p>      OK. You can relax. The hard part is over. Now that you know      HOW to calculate a parabolic curve of any size and/or      width, I'm going to save you the trouble. The chart      accompanying this article contains a list of measurements      based on 10 verticals between each unit (this is, in short,      a list of coordinates for perfectionists who want to lay      out an absolutely accurate curve).    </p>            <p>      Please note that all of the fractional numbers on the chart      are based on an Of of 4. To use them for ANY focal length,      just divide by four and then multiply by the desired focal      length. (Example: I want a focal length of 11. So I divide      each number by 4 and then multiply the result by 11.)      Remember, too, that the charted numbers represent points on      the curvature measured up from the base in one-tenth      intervals. That's cutting everything pretty fine, and you      can skip a few of the points if you wish.    </p>    <p>      And here's one final tip about the accompanying chart: SAVE      IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. To my knowledge, the figures you      see here have never been printed before and they can save      hours of math work for anyone who might ever want to lay      out a true parabolic curve.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you really dig math, here's a bit of far-out      figuring that you can use to keep yourself occupied some      rainy afternoon: In any right triangle formed in any half      of a parabola and touching both the focus and the curve      (Fig. 11), h plus a is always twice the focal length      and-naturally-h2 minus a2 always equals b2. You can use      those facts as further proof of exactness when scribing      your next parabolic curve.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: George Donald Graham, the author of this      article, is also the author of Capture the Sun, a very      interesting little paperback book (Enterprises Unlimited,      Star Route, Ferndale, California 95536) that delves more      deeply into the calculation and construction of parabolic      solar energy devices.
