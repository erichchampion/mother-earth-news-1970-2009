                    <h5 id="byline">      by ROHN ENGH    </h5>    <p>      Of all the "alternative" sources of energy available to the      "little guy", wood is probably the easiest to understand      and use. As well it should be. After all, mankind has been      burning wood for a lot more years than it has been building      solar collectors, setting up windplants, or tinkering with      waterwheels.    </p>    <p>      And there's something so deep-down satisfying about      stretching out in front of a roaring fireplace or a fully      stoked wood-burning stove on a long, dark, icy, wind-swept      winter's evening. Wood heat, besides being such a readily      available low-technology source of energy, is just plain      enjoyable!    </p>    <p>      And that's why we're featuring wood and wood-burners in      this and the next two issues of this magazine. The six      pages you see here should set the proper tone for the more      extensive information on the subject that you'll find in      MOTH ERs 48 and 49.-The Editors.    </p>        <p>      Scenes from the past? Yes and no. There was a time when      country folks all over this continenet cut and split their      own wood for heating and cooking as a matter of course.Then      came the age of Fossil Fuel, and thought those days of      burning were almost behind us.    </p>    <p>      Now that fossil fuel are becoming increasingly expensive,      however, it's starting to make a good sense for many of us,      once again, to satisfy at least part of our cooking and      heating needs with wood... the most traditional, renewable,      and lowest-technology fuel of them all!    </p>    <p>      Six years ago, when we bought our farm here in northwestern      Wisconsin, we found the toolshed filled with quaint      memorabilia: a two-man saw, six-pound maul with rough-hewn      handle, a rusted Swede saw, several wedges, and a sizable      double-bladed axe. We hung the items up on the toolshed      wall as museum pieces, and proceeded to "civilize" the      farmstead by installing an oil furnace and hot air heat in      the house.    </p>    <p>      For the next five years we sat there, thinking we were      satisfied with our oil burner . . . and paying the price      which it annually extorted from us. Up here in northern      Wisconsin, where stretches of 20°-below weather-with      wind-are not uncommon, it's easy for a family to spend      upwards of $600 a year on fuel (especially if they live in      an old, not-so-airtight farmhouse).    </p>    <p>      Then, last winter-just as snow flurries began blowing in      from Canada-we got to know and love wood heat. As an      efficient and economical source of warmth for our entire      housewith an intimate, personal quality all its own-this      "primitive" method is (perhaps surprisingly!) it.    </p>    <p>      I'll admit that we didn't discover this all at once or      completely on our own. In fact, we initially made the      change from oil to wood because we were forced to do so      (after giving up our preliminary visions of camping for the      winter in the back yard of some friends who live on the      Gulf of Mexico). A doctor had traced the severe allergy of      our youngest son to the hydrocarbons in petroleum products,      and advised us to switch to some fuel other than oil or      gas. Electric heaters were, however, totally impractical      for our elderly farmhouse. Wood alone was left.    </p>    <p>      This prospect was sprung on us in October, which meant a      lot of scramblin' before the cold Wisconsin winter set in.      At that point, I'd never felled a tree in my life . . . but      the "quaint memorabilia" in the shed had just become      vitally important to us.    </p>    <p>      We started by stoking up our old country home's fireplace      and a small "showcase" wood-burning stove in the kitchen.      (There were enough deadfalls out in the pasture to feed      these two without my facing the task of cutting down a      tree.) But the stove would burn out in the middle of the      night, and the fireplace, with its serious heat loss, was      no match for the winter wind. We nearly froze during our      first two weeks.    </p>    <p>      Then we cried "help" in our local Tri-County Advertiser and      located a big, secondhand, wood-burning heater for $50.      With itplus the aid of a neighboring old-timer and a little      ingenuity-we not only survived but enjoyed our initial      winter of wood (the first of many, since our change of fuel      has indeed helped to relieve our son's allergy problem).    </p>    <p>      The heart of our system, an Ashley heater, is located in      the center of the kitchen where it provides the family with      atmosphere, a handy "meeting' spot", and-of course-warmth.      It's a great help if you want to take some of the stiffness      out of your hands and feet after a frigid taste of the      outdoors (or you just need to stop your whole self from      shaking on a chilly morning). Our boys use the stove to dry      their mittens, and my wife, Jeri, finds it ideal for      keeping food and cocoa-a winter staple at our house-warm.    </p>    <p>      The crackling of the fire in the stove is in itself a basic      earthsound attraction. The steady subtle murmur of burning      logs casts a comfortable feel around the kitchen, and      encourages long, lazy daydreams when you tilt back      in--yes!--the old rocker with your stockinged feet      stretched out toward the solid warmth. Such closeness to      one's needs is a rare pleasure these days and a welcome      contrast to the increasingly indirect lighting, heating,      and communication patterns "enjoyed" in our society at      large.    </p>    <p>      On a cold morning 11-year-old Danny absorbs as much heat as      he can, then takes off for the barn to milk his goat before      the school bus arrives. And I, after storing up some of the      stove's radiation myself, pull away from the warmth and      activity in the kitchen to go outside to the woodpile.      There I start the day with fifteen minutes of axe work . .      . which keeps me in better shape than the jogging I used to      do every morning.    </p>    <p>      With the wind whistling at my back, I then carry an armful      of good chunks in to the woodbox and toss some of the fuel      into the stove. The special warmth of wood heat permeates      the house, and gives me a sense of full accomplishment . .      . because I've personally completed the cycle of finding,      cutting, and splitting my own energy source and      transforming it into warmth for both family and home.    </p>    <p>      Our big Ashley will take a log two feet long and eight      inches thick. It has an airtight firebox and ash door (a      very good feature) and a special draft system that prevents      the waste of a lot of heat which would otherwise be lost up      the chimney.    </p>    <p>      Air for combustion of the wood enters the heater's firebox      at the top, is warmed by the blaze as it passes through a      downdraft stack, and is then distributed evenly along the      length of the burning logs by an intake manifold. An      automatic thermostat, with which you dial the degree of      heat you want, opens and closes the damper at the top of      the downdraft stack to admit just enough air to maintain      the desired temperature.    </p>    <p>      We've found the Ashley to be highly effective . . . even on      the few days last winter when temperatures dropped to      30° below zero and the wind came up to give us a chill      factor equivalent to -60°. We conserved fuel by putting      blankets over the kitchen doorways, brought out the      Monopoly set, and kept more comfortable than our nearby      friends . . . who had their oil burners' thermostats set on      high and still couldn't get really warm unless they stood      in front of their kitchen ovens. That's the real advantage      of a wood-fired stove over "modern" heat: You can get close      to the source and toast comfortably, yet still have warmth      evenly radiated to the rest of the house. Another good      thing about an Ashley is that it doesn't require a huge      supply of wood which has been dried and seasoned for a      year. The unit is perfectly content when fed with logs      freshly cut no more than an hour before. This is possible      because the design of the heater (and certain others on the      market) causes the contents of the firebox to burn from the      bottom up, not from the top down. Thus the upper wood-even      if it's green-dries out as it gradually falls, and is      consumed so completely that carbon and creosote deposits in      the chimney-caused by unburned wood gases-are kept at a      minimum. As one neighboring old-timer commented, a stove      like ours "even burns up the ashes".    </p>    <p>      If -our wood burner isn't that hood-or even if it is-you      should definitely be aware of the inflammable wastes that      may well build up in your home's chimney. A large roaring      flame, like that which leaps up when you throw a      wastebasket of paper into the stove, could ignite the soot      and resins in the flue and possibly trigger a serious house      fire.    </p>    <p>      Although the chance of such a flare-up is remote, it's wise      to be conscious of the hazard. Some old-timers prefer to      let any chimney blaze burn itself out (as long as the fire      doesn't spread), while others keep a large bag of salt      handy to dump down the flue as an extinguisher.    </p>    <p>      One useful item I found up in our homestead's barn was a      ladder with hooks on its top end. It was the same length as      the pitched portion of the house roof and had been kept up      there in the old days just in case a chimney fire did get      started. We put the "antique" back in its rightful place      atop the house and left it there all winter. Though we've      never had to use the ladder, we'd rather be safe than      sorry.    </p>    <p>      The best answer to the problem of chimney fires, of course,      ies in preventing the buildup of inflammable residue in the      first place. Every now and then, some people give their      stoves' fireboxes a sprinkling of salt . . . which seems to      help keep the chimneys sootfree. I do the same thing with a      commercially available (from Marine Electrolysis Eliminator      Company, 1137 S.W. Hanford, Seattle, Washington 98134)      product called Red Devil.    </p>    <p>      Or-if you forget occasional applications of the cleaners      mentioned above-just look down your flue now and then and      knock off the soot with a long pole or a chain swung in the      shaft (be careful not to dislodge any mortar).    </p>    <p>      By the way: If this all sounds terribly complicated or      dangerous, it's not. Any kind of equipment should be kept      clean and in good operating condition. Do the same for your      chimney and the chances of its catching fire are less than      those of a backup or other malfunction in an oil or gas      furnace.    </p>    <p>      A close look at your home's water pipes is also in order if      the house has wood heat. Any line that runs along an      outside wall, as some of ours do, can be wrapped with      insulation to protect it from freezing. And, if you leave      the house for any length of time, it's most important to      have a dependable friend pop in and reload your heater for      you. The better models hold 100 pounds of wood at one      filling and will burn up to 18 hours unattended. If you      plan to be gone several days or more, of course, it's best      to drain the water pipes. Anyhow, the pleasures of wood      heat make it more fun to stay put and keep the home fires      burnin'. .    </p>    <p>      During our first season of heating with wood we were too      caught up in the initiation throes of chain saw      maintenance, log-splitting techniques, and tree-felling      traumas to keep a considered record of how much fuel we      used. This year we intend to be a little more scientific,      especially since our research indicates that an Ashley will      heat a six-room house all winter on only two to three cords      of wood . . . depending on home layout, insulation, and the      severity of the weather. (Our house has nine rooms. We      closed off two, and the other seven stayed totally      comfortable.) Heaters differ in performance, of course, and      one farmer told us that our model uses only a third as much      wood as he'd needed with another brand.    </p>    <p>      Last winter gave me my education in fuel gathering. Before      I'd "graduated", I mangled three axes, one chain saw bar,      and one sixpound maul. My mistakes were my teachers . . .      and when the temperature plummets to the below-zero mark      and stays there, a student learns fast. Perhaps my      experience might be helpful to others who are interested in      burning wood.    </p>    <p>      Spring and fall are the best times to cut fuel (no bugs, no      weeds, no burrs, no prickly heat). If you're using a good      automatic heater, the wood can be burned immediately.      Otherwise, if possible, it should be left out to dry for a      season.    </p>    <p>      Which timber makes the best fuel? The hardwoods burn      slowerand usually hotter-and oak, ash, birch, and maple are      generally the favorites. Elm is good, too, but tough to      split. A first-rate heater will burn even poplar (low fuel      on the totem pole), however, and keep your house warm while      doing it. Fireplaces and less efficient stoves won't.    </p>    <p>      It's handy to have your own source of fuel, but it's not a      necessity. A little scouting around can turn up many      possibilities: neighbors who want a tree taken down,      telephone and electric company prunings, outlying farmers      or country dump locations with groves to be cleared, new      construction sites where you might be paid to haul away      timber.    </p>    <p>      In our case, we're lucky enough to have a built-in supply      of oak (a great fuel!) in the woods on our south 40. Our      house and barn were built back before the turn of the      century with timber from this same stand, and I feel an      intangible "rightness" to the whole process when I go out      there and haul in each load for the stove.    </p>    <p>      To handle the wood, my old-timer neighbor told me, "First      thing you need is a chain saw. And don't buy a used one.      Get it new, so there won't be any mysteries about how it's      been treated." Chain saws, he explained, have to be      coddled. They dislike sand and dirt and need regular      cleaning and maintenance checks.    </p>    <p>      Of several good brands of chain saws, the McCulloch was      highly recommended to us and we invested in a Mac 10 model.      We made that choice partly because there's a McCulloch      service center in town . . . a factor that becomes not just      handy but critical if you need repairs in midwinter.    </p>    <p>      When you begin to use your new tool, remember that its      powerpacked cutting action is equal to the strength of      several workhorses and deserves a lot of respect. Work      slowly, and follow the good and sensible precautions listed      in any chain saw handbook. Many oldtimers say that two      woodsmen should always work together, with one clearing      twigs and branches from the ground to give the other open      space to do his sawing.    </p>    <p>      My own biggest challenge was learning to cut a tree down      singlehanded, and I'd like to pass on some important do's      and don'ts.    </p>    <p>      First, make sure your chain saw is properly oiled and well      filled with gas. Then give an eye to which way the tree      leans and gauge your cuts to let it fall in that direction.      Or, if your prospect is good and straight, check which side      holds the most and/or heaviest branches.    </p>    <p>      Unlike the tall pines of Walt Disney movies, thick oaks      with hundred-pound boughs won't give you much cooperation.      Whenever possible, let the branch weight of a tree be your      guide to where it's going to fall. Once last winter, when I      tried to fall an oak against its natural direction in order      to miss a nearby fence, the weight of the tree shifted      halfway through my cutting, pinched the saw, broke its      chain, and bent its bar. Then, as I tried to retrieve my      tool with wedges, the big oak decided to fall anyway . . .      right through the fence.    </p>    <p>      When you can, begin felling a tree by first removing some      of its branches. Do this with a first-cut into the limb      from the bottom with your chain saw. Then sever it from the      top.    </p>    <p>      Your initial cut into the trunk itself should be      horizontal, about one-third of the way through the diameter      (see Fig. 1), and into the side toward which you want the      tree to fall. Next saw diagonally downward to the deepest      point of the first saw mark.    </p>    <p>      Always start with the cut which is parallel to the ground      for at least three reasons:    </p>    <p>      [ 1 ] It's probably the most tiring of all, and is best      done when you're still fresh and energetic.    </p>    <p>      [2] The weight of the tree is less likely to pinch the saw      if you make the diagonal cut second.    </p>    <p>      [3] If you were to reverse the order of these operations,      you'd find it more difficult to make the two incisions      meet.    </p>    <p>      When you make your third and final cut (from the opposite      side) don't saw all the way through the trunk. Leave enough      wood to serve as a hinge, which you can sever after the      tree falls (see Fig. 2). Otherwise, when the great mass      crashes to the ground, the branches will act as springs and      cause the trunk to kick back. Many a folk song has been      inspired by the death of a logger who misjudged this      recoil.    </p>    <p>      Begin trimming out your fallen tree by cutting away the      small crinkly branches (loggers call these hair). Throw      them into piles and, when you have enough, burn them where      they lie. Cut the bigger boughs and the trunk into      convenient lengths for your stove or heater . . . but don't      attempt to use the section of the tree where a main branch      has grown out of the trunk. These nieces are impossible to      split and are usually too large for the door of a stove.      Leave them on the ground to be burned with the smaller      branches.    </p>    <p>      Among still more "memorabilia" up in our barn I found two      handmade wooden sleds with metal runners that were used for      transporting wood from the forest in the old days. These      served us well for the hauling of fuel until the snow got      too deep. Then I switched to a flat, plastic sled that      glided along the tops of the banks    </p>    <p>      I pile all our cut logs by the back door . . . and whenever      I feel the urge, I step outside and do some wood splitting.      The colder the weather, the easier the job: When the      mercury drops the moisture in the chunks freezes, and the      smaller sections will cleave with one blow.    </p>    <p>      Thick chunks are a little more difficult . . . and here's      how I break up hard white oak: First, I examine the face of      the wood for any existing cracks (which serve as my      splitting guide). Then, with a sixpound maul, I start      swinging away at the center of the drum (see Fig. 3)-      Sometimes the piece splits open quickly. Other times, not.      It's satisfying but tiring work.    </p>    <p>      Wedges (Fig. 4) are excellent tools for a woodsman. If a      log refuses to be split with an axe or maul, place a wedge      along the grain and drive it in with your maul's flat end.      You may have to use two or even three wedges on a stubborn      chunk.    </p>    <p>      What about kindling? Automatic heaters-which burn all      nightdon't need it. In fact, one fire built at the      beginning of the season can be kept alive all winter. If      you're using a fireplace or smaller wood stove, gather your      small fuel early and keep it from getting damp The drier      the sticks are, of course, the easier it is to get your      fire going on a chilly morning.    </p>    <p>      Dry twigs make good kindling, but for a real tried and true      fire starter, split some of your logs two or three times      let the pieces dry well, and split them again into thin      strips. Another first-class kindling source is the log      trimmings from a local lumber mill. Some operations give      these away, while others charge a dollar for a pickup load.    </p>    <p>      Does all this sound like a lot of work? It is . . . but      it's labor of a very satisfying kind. Axe swinging is a      safe, non-toxic tranquilizer (even when you think you don't      need one) . . . and I find it a surefire way to get lots of      fresh Wisconsin air into my lungs in a hurry.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps it's those moments between axe swings, however,      that are the most valuable benefit of all. Many of us have      forgotten the delight of examining in close focus the small      things around us . . . and the chopping of wood offers its      practitioner a chance to . . . well, to pause and look.    </p>    <p>      While I rest between blows I find myself counting the rings      in a large oak, watching a squirrel scamper down a branch,      comparing the bark of a hickory to that of a birch, or      examining the way a branch grows from a tree's main trunk .      . . all manifestations of a rhythm and beauty of growth and      life that somehow refresh the soul.    </p>    <p>      Smells, too, take on a new importance when you heat with      wood. The job makes you get outside in the snow in spite of      yourself, and you find that you love it. The great winter      outdoors has a fragrance all its own when you're sawing or      splitting fuel . . . a fresh, clear sharpness leavened with      the pungent scent of inner wood newly opened. Inside the      house, the soft odor of burning logs greets you like      incense and wraps you with warmth and comfort.    </p>    <p>      As I fill our heater, I look upon every piece of split fuel      as a special event of my own making. Each chunk represents      a swing of the axe . . . a movement of my own muscles      transferred directly into heat that keeps my family warm.      It tells me-with certainty-that I'm directly involved in      the trilogy of human needs: food, clothing, and shelter.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      The following article originally appeared in the December      1973 issue of LIFESTYLE!, copyright 1973 by THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted), Inc. and reprinted here by permission.    </p>
