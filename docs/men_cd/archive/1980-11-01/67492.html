        <p>In 1980, MOTHER's gardens hosted 25 eager apprentices. And, with 1981 just around the corner, we're extending an invitation to <em>all</em> of our readers to ...</p><p>If you've already read about Alan Chadwick and his important contributions to horticulture (see the tribute on page 70), you'll be glad to know that - although the man is gone - his world-renowned wholistic gardening technique lives on!</p><p>MOTHER's staff is very happy to announce another series of workshops based - in part - upon Chadwick's methods of biodynamic/French-intensive gardening . . . which will be held next spring, summer, and fall (April 20-29, May 4-13, June 1-10, August 31 - September 9, and September 28 - October 7) on our beautiful 622.4 mountain acres in western North Carolina.</p><p>Master gardeners Kerry and Barbara Sullivan - both of whom are former apprentices of Alan Chadwick and now fulltime members of MOTHER'S Eco-Village staff - will lead workshop participants through a full ten days of theory, technique, and actual practice in MOTHER'S organic gardens.</p><p>Those who attend will learn about preparation of raised beds, sowing and transplanting, and maintenance tasks such as weeding and watering . . . all of which will involve plenty of hands-on experience. Planned discussions with Kerry and Barbara will include advice on compost, seedlings, greenhouses, potting soils, cold frames, and more!</p><p>The fee for each session will be $150, with camping facilities (but not meals) provided for the participants. Because of the intense treatment of the subject matter and the long hours involved in getting hands-on experience in the gardens (this is to be a <em>work</em> shop), Kerry and Barbara have stipulated that no families or pets be brought along for the sessions.</p><p>If you'd like to obtain more information or register for one of the workshops, write to Kerry and Barbara Sullivan, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791 (please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope). We hope to share our garden with you next year!</p>
