                		<h5 id="byline">By Kay T. Farmer</h5>    <p>      Feeling a slight sense of apprehension, I took my first      look at what was to be home for my husband and me over the      course of the three months to come: a 12' X 12'      glass-enclosed room perched on top a 40-foot tower on      northern Idaho's Gisborne Mountain. Mike and I were about      to begin a season as fire lookouts for the U.S. Forest      Service . . . and I was still a bit leery of the rustic      life we would lead in our crow's-nest.    </p>    <p>      The tower was at the end of a chunky, rutted road . . .      some 30 miles from a store, ten miles from our nearest      neighbor, and two miles from any source of water. We had no      electricity, and only a small government radio for      communication. The furnishings in our mountaintop aerie      included a bed, a table and two chairs, a tiny stove, a      midget refrigerator . . . and the tool of our "trade": the      four-foot-tall fire-finder we used to search for plumes of      smoke.    </p>    <p>      Besides spotting possible blazes, our other responsibility      was to report daily weather data to the regional Forest      Serv ice station . . . so, as you can imagine, we looked      forward to having a lot of spare time to enjoy our      magnificent 360° view of mountains, lakes, and sky.    </p>    <h3>WATER CONSERVATION</h3>    <p>      Soon after settling into the lofty home, we realized that      water would be our most precious resource. Because the      nearest spring was a round-trip hike of four miles, we had      to devise ways to conserve the supply (a Forest Service      truck made periodic - if irregular - visits to      fill up our two 10-gallon tanks).    </p>    <p>      The biggest water wasters in most urban homes, of course,      are the various components of the indoor plumbing system.      Since we had an outhouse - and <em>no</em> piped-in      water - we didn't even have to concern ourselves with      that kind of extravagance. Mike and I found, however, that      we were able to save still more of the valuable liquid by      practicing our own unorthodox (but efficient! )      conservation methods.    </p>    <p>      Our baths were usually shared, short (nobody lingers when      bathing on a windy catwalk in 40°F weather!) . . . and      lim ited to one every two or three days. We washed our      clothes - once a week - in the rainwater      collected in a two-gallon bucket. Furthermore, Mike and I      found that - if we steamed our vegetables - the      same water could be reused for several meals. We also made      it a habit to eat together, out of the same pot or pan, so      that we'd have fewer dishes to do. Then all our eating and      cooking utensils for the day were washed after dinner . . .      and one evening's rinse water was saved to serve as the      <em>next</em> day's wash water.    </p>    <p>      In spite of such Spartan methods, we were actually quite      comfortable . . . <em>and</em> a bit proud of the fact that      our water consumption was less than 2% of that of many      American couples (we went through 15-20 gallons a week, as      compared to an average-use figure of 200 gallons a day!).      We were surprised - and pleased - to know that      so little could do so much!    </p>    <h3>COOKING AND FORAGING</h3>    <p>      We also learned how to stretch our stockpile of food.      Storage space was at a premium inside our cramped quarters      . . . so Mike and I quickly found ways to trim our food      supply while maintaining a varied diet. ( An added benefit      of such frugality was the low <em>cost</em> of our simple      meals . . . in fact - at summer's end - we      estimated that the two of us had spent a total of $75 for      food during our entire stay in Idaho!    </p>    <p>      The tower was equipped with only a small single-burner      propane cooker, so our dinners usually consisted of      one-skillet dishes, such as a vegetable and rice mixture.      One of our favorite staples was dried lentils: They're      inexpensive, easy to store, and nutritious. We often ate      the legumes as a cooked vegetable, and also sprouted them      for use in salads.    </p>    <p>      Our healthful, low-budget diet was supplemented by the      amazing array of wild foods growing on our Idaho mountain .      . . including thimbleberries, raspberries, serviceberries,      wild ginger, mint, dandelions, cattails, goldenrod, and      fireweed. On sunny days, the catwalk outside our tower room      was crowded with boxes of our foraged harvest . . . all of      it "baking" into wild teas and dried fruits. Our best      discovery, however, was the patch of huckleberries that      sprang up right at the foot of the tower. The private hoard      provided us, for <em>weeks</em> , with the basis for      delicious pie, syrup, cake, relish, jelly, and jam.    </p>    <h3>ENERGY CONSUMPTION</h3>    <p>      Since no electricity ran to the tower, our energy usage was      minimal. We got along very nicely without many of the      "standard" appliances found in most American homes . . .      and even managed to reduce our use of the tower's propane      heater and lamp. After all, our glass-enclosed home      received brilliant sunshine - on all sides -      from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. every day, so we hardly felt the      need for artificial heat or light.    </p>        <p>      My energy-economical husband - who was eager to make      use of that sun-pro vided heat - designed and      constructed a simple solar shower, which we used out on the      lower level of the catwalk. The device consisted of a small      black metal plate collector (positioned just below the      southern windows) and a five-gallon collapsible plastic      water container mounted on the catwalk railing. When the      liquid in the latter unit was allowed to drip through a      hose and into the copper tubing of the collector, it was      warmed by the sun . . . and then flowed through a second      hose into another storage unit (really just an old      styrofoam ice chest) which hung under the catwalk just      above the top landing. Mike attached a faucet and shower      head to the last container . . . so whenever we wanted a      quick solar shower, it was ready and waiting for us!    </p>    <p>      Long after we finished our service as Forest Service fire      lookouts, the spirit of the simple lifestyle on Gisborne      Mountain remained with us. By doing without most of the      creature comforts of modern civilization, we had become      more attuned to the natural world . . . and had learned to      recognize the efficiency of nature in its untouched state.      Even though we returned to our permanent home and winter      jobs, our tower experience left us with a new understanding      of self-sufficiency that we've since tried to apply to      every aspect of our daily lives.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Related Articles:</strong>    </p>    <p>      LIVE AND LEARN IN THE FOREST!    </p>    <p>      A SEASON IN THE OLYMPICS    </p>
