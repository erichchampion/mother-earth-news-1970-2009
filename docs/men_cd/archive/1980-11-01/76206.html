                        <p>      <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of must</em> <em>of us      when it comes to getting back to the land and living a life      of voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains array back in the autumn of 1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the roast of Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting bark to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you 'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) , P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28791. And please don't expert      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will he answered here      - and here only - where we all can road what      the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WISDOM OF HELEN AND SCOTT</strong>    </p>    <p>      My family and I are planning our move back to the land and      have set our sights on a place that has good (or at least      salvageable) soil, a reasonable growing season, and a      location no less than several hundred miles from the      nearest nuclear power plant.    </p>    <p>      We have heard that <em>your</em> farm is now within 100      miles of a nuclear facility and in an acid rain area. Can      you tell us how such unfortunate manifestations of our      "modern times" have affected your lives . . . and how you      are dealing with them?    </p>    <p>      Our lifestyle is the same as it was <em>before</em> the New      England power plants existed. After all, what choice is      there . . . other than to speak and write against the      spread of such monstrosities, sign petitions, and generally      make every reasonable effort to oppose the construction of      the facilities? (Of <em>course</em> , we could move again,      as we did when the construction of a ski resort threatened      to mar the area around our quiet Vermont valley home, but      we've really come to believe that there's no place to hide      anymore.)    </p>    <p>      We haven't noticed any negative effects as yet -      either to our physical health or to the well- being of our      garden - as a result of either the nuclear plants or      the acid rain. (Which, of course, does not mean that we are      not concerned!)    </p>			<hr />    <p>      I know you have a large library and that your books are      probably used quite often. Can you tell me how you protect      the printed treasures? (I've tried, in the past, covering      mine in plastic, but that wrap has led to the accumulation      of moisture and subsequent mildew problems.)    </p>    <p>      We <em>do</em> have a large library, which covers      <em>five</em> walls in our home (we find that      floor-to-ceiling bookcases are prettier than wallpaper, and      provide good insulation as well!). Though many of the books      are more than 50 years old, we've never tried to cover them      with plastic. Our "preservation" process simply involves      treating every one with respect. (Our books <em>do</em>      sometimes get rumpled and damaged, but only when we lend      them out. We feel that if you regularly allow others to      borrow your volumes, it might indeed be wise to use a      protective covering - perhaps brown paper - and      to keep your own "library card" system . . . so you can      keep track of where the books are and, perhaps, eventually      get them back.)    </p>			<hr />    <p>      My wife and I recently sold our small farm near      Philadelphia and we are considering relocating somewhere in      Maine (I'd really like to live within the belt between      Bangor and the sea). My spouse, however, is concerned that      the winters there might be far too cold . . . even for      "youngsters" like us (we're in our 60's). Can you tell me      if you find the Maine winters debilitatingly chilly? I'd      also like to know the length of your area's growing season,      and whether - in your opinion - reasonably      priced land is still available "up north".    </p>    <p>      We've lived here for 27 years, and - being in our      70's and 90's - are a bit older than you folks. We've      never found the winters as piercingly cold as those in      Vermont (where the temperature sometimes dropped to 45°      below zero!). However, we <em>enjoyed</em> the dry cold of      Vermont. Here in Maine the wintertime "lows" - which      we enjoy as well - rarely reach 25° below . . .      but the humidity at our coastal location is typically high      and can make the cold seem worse than it is. Inland, away      from the ocean fogs, the weather is less humid.    </p>    <p>      Our frost-free growing season is about 105 days. The      <em>deep freeze</em> , on the other hand, lasts about three      months in this neck of the woods.    </p>    <p>      We're afraid that - given the state of today's      economy - reasonable land prices have all but      disappeared, nationwide. We bought our Vermont sugarbush      for $20 per acre back in the 1930's . . . and heard      recently that the came property is now going for $8,000 per      acre! Of course, land inflation in our area of Maine is not      so severe as it is on the Vermont ski slopes. Good      waterfront property is in the "$2,U00 per" range now . . .      but "landlocked" prices are still a bit lower.    </p>			<hr />    <p>      I'm a 17-year-old girl living - at the moment -      with my parents in Papua, New Guinea, and I'm serious about      homesteading. I'm not able to buy land here, as I'm not a      citizen, so I'll be returning to the U.S. soon . . . but      with few assets. Another complicating factor is that I'm      somewhat unfamiliar with the climate, land, and people in      the States. What do you suggest I do? Should I get a job,      or further my schooling? I thoroughly enjoy your column and      books and appreciate the help I've received from reading      both.    </p>    <p>      When you get back to the States, try to obtain a job on a      farm during the growing season <em>and</em> a part-time      <em>winter</em> job in town. That "split shift" will allow      you to acquire some of the skills you'll need for      homesteading . . . pick up some money . . . perhaps go to      night school during the off-season . . . and learn to live      simply and efficiently.    </p>			<hr />    <p>      You have mentioned that you are using dolomite limestone on      your compost piles. If we're thinking about the same      substance, I've found it to be pretty expensive ... at      least here in Quebec, where I've been able to locate it      only in small bottles in health food stores.    </p>    <p>      I'd like to know how much dolomite you add per compost      pile, and whether you can get the limestone in large bags.    </p>    <p>      We do use dolomite limestone in our alkaline compost piles      (a thin scattering on every layer). We buy the material in      50-pound bags at the local farm supply store, and it lasts      for years if the sack is kept dry.    </p>			<hr />    <p>      During some recent reading we were interested to learn that      you were once associated with Krishnamurti. What do you      think of his teachings?    </p>    <p>      For around five years, in my late teens and early 20's      (Helen speaking), my life was closely linked to      Krishnamurti. I lived with, traveled with, and corresponded      with him during that time . . . and was greatly and      beneficially influenced by his unique character and      personality. The influence was lasting, although all      contact with him has since been broken.    </p>    <p>      Krishnamurti's teaching emphasizes psychological freedom,      inner awareness, and the search for completion in life. I,      too, believe in all that, but I need no longer follow The      Teacher. I'm working out my own life in my own way, as      everyone should. J. Krishnamurti's job is talking . . .      trying to enlighten people. Ours is to act . . . to do . .      . to live full and purposeful lives . . . and to constantly      strive to feel and express the beauty and unity of the      cosmos.    </p>
