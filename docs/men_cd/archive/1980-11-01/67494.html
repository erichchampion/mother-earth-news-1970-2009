                <p>      It's a sturdy pack animal, a valuable wool producer, and an      affectionate companion to boot. In short, a llama can offer      your homestead livestock program...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">    By Debbie Romaine</h5>        <p>      I spotted the pastured animals before I pulled into Harlan      Harris's driveway. And that first glance was enough to      alert my senses to the <em>strangeness</em> of the beasts.      Their slim legs appeared too frail to support the thickly      wooled bodies . . . and - as I pulled off the road      for a better look - the herd, acting in choreographed      unison, lifted their long necks and turned their graceful      horselike heads . . . to get a better look at <em>me</em> .    </p>    <p>      The animals posed - motionless as statues -      until I came close to the fence . . . whereupon, still      acting as one, they exploded across the field. I was amused      to notice that the peculiarity of the creatures was      maintained even in flight, as their sprinting gait involved      lifting both feet on a side simultaneously!    </p>    <p>      The mysterious beasts were, of course, llamas ( <em>Lama      glama</em> ). Natives of the South American Andes, they're      rapidly gaining popularity in the United States . . . in      the eyes of livestock keepers who use them as pack animals,      raise them for the wool they produce, or simply are      fascinated by the beasts' personalities! In fact, the      purpose of my journey was to visit a gentleman who      <em>supplies</em> llamas to such eager buyers . . . Mr.      Harlan Harris from Tacoma, Washington.    </p>    <h3>FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS...</h3>    <p>      Harlan first became interested in llamas some ten years      ago, when a friend brought an aged animal back from a trip      to Las Vegas. Harris borrowed the beast to lend a bit of      life to his Christmas nativity scene ... and he was      astounded when 25,000 passers-by stopped to see and ask      questions about the gentle "actor".    </p>    <p>      It seems that Harlan was fascinated by the elderly llama,      too . . . because it wasn't much more than a year later      that he purchased two young animals for his own ranch.      Today he maintains a herd of about 18 llamas (the number,      of course, fluctuates as new animals are born and others      are sold).    </p>    <h3>MADE FOR THE MOUNTAINS</h3>    <p>      Most of the folks who purchase llamas, Harlan told me, plan      to use them as pack animals . . . a purpose for which the      South American natives are well suited. The hemoglobin in      their blood has an unusually well-developed ability to      absorb oxygen - a trait which makes the animals at      home at high elevations - while their deceptively      slender legs are fully able to support hefty loads over      steep, rocky terrain. (A 200-pound male llama is capable of      carrying up to 130 pounds, and covering up to 20 miles a      day when doing so. Folks who "pack" the animals regularly,      however, usually try to load the beasts with about half      that weight.)    </p>    <p>      The little load-haulers are intelligent as well. In fact,      Harlan estimates that the average llama can learn enough to      begin functioning as a pack animal after about <em>20      minutes</em> of training!    </p>        <h3>NOBODY'S PERFECT</h3>    <p>      There are, of course, a few small problems that you should      know about before setting out to establish a homestead      llama herd. For one thing, the first meeting between a      horse and one of the "humpless camels" is often a traumatic      event. While the llama will probably be unaffected by the      encounter, the larger animal is likely to spook at the very      sight of the "peculiar" South American beast. (But once a      llama and a horse become accustomed to each other's      company, they'll usually get along fine!)    </p>    <p>      As a general rule, llamas are loyal and gentle. They do,      however, have their limits and - like camels -      are capable of hissing, kicking, and spitting to show their      anger. Fortunately, the animals seldom use such "talents"      on humans . . . reserving them, instead, to show their      displeasure with other members of their flock.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Some llamas will spit at people when      angry: A breeder we know passed on a simple solution to the      problem, though. He just dresses in old clothes</em>      - <em>since llama saliva can be pretty      rank-smelling</em> - <em>and then lets the animal      "have at" him, without reacting to the "insult" at all.      Alter an hour or two, he reports, the llama will become      bored with the game ... and the habit will be broken for      good!]</em>    </p>    <p>      More often than not, a llama will show any dissatisfaction      with its master or mistress (usually as a result of being,      according to <em>its</em> standards, overloaded or worked      too long) by lying down. A beast of burden that protests in      such a manner won't likely budge until the problem is      remedied . . . and no amount of cajoling, begging,      swearing, prodding, or pushing will affect the animal's      decision.    </p>    <h3>WOOLGATHERING</h3>    <p>      Of course, a llama keeper who raises his or her beasts for      wool is less likely to be faced with a balky animal than is      a person who's concerned with the creature's pack-carrying      ability. And llamas do produce a high-quality wool. When      sheared once every other year, each adult animal can be      expected to yield 6 to 12 pounds of thick, light fleece . .      . which is (at the time of this writing) worth around $1.40      per ounce (retail, cleaned and carded).    </p>    <p>      The animals have two-layer coats . . . an outer fleece      composed of (relatively) long, coarse hairs and a softer,      finer underwool. Furthermore, you can gather the valuable      fibers either by shearing or by <em>combing</em> your      llamas. Sheared wool will contain both outer- and      underwools. On the other hand, should you choose to      "harvest" with a comb, you'll obtain mostly the downy      underfleece . . . which is similar to that produced by such      fine wool sheep as Corriedales.    </p>    <p>      Better yet, llamas' coats don't contain the oils that sheep      wool does, so - while one can expect a 30 to 40%      weight loss after washing the fiber produced by a flock of      ewes - llama fleece doesn't lose any weight when it's      washed! What you shear (or comb) is what you get . . . and      it's all usable!    </p>    <p>      The Andean animals occur in a rainbow of colors, too      - including reddish brown, a mottled pattern known as      "moromoro", snowy white, butterscotch, and velvety black      - so it's seldom necessary to dye their wool before      using it in home spinning projects. (Once spun - and      lightly twisted - the yarn must be washed in warm      water, with a mild detergent added, to set the "twist" of      the cord and remove any "wet dog" odor.)    </p>    <h3>PERSONABLE PETS</h3>    <p>      Young llamas are possessed of almost <em>insatiable</em>      curiosity, and make very beguiling pets. They're friendly      by nature, too . . . quickly attaching themselves to other      animals and to their owners. They'll even "chum around"      with dogs! (But, I'm told, there's <em>nothing</em> more      pathetic than a lonely llama ... and, for that reason, some      breeders will sell their animals only in groups of two or      more.)    </p>    <p>      Harlan's herd belongs to an "extended family" that includes      Mediterranean miniature horses, pygmy goats, and dwarf      Sicilian donkeys . . . and - as far as the llamas are      concerned - all of the animals are "close as kin"      (except for one particularly ornery billy goat, which they      view as a pest).    </p>    <p>      Because of the breed's ability to make friends with other      creatures, an "only child" llama will usually be just as      happy with attention from its owner and "different" pasture      mates as it would be in the company of another of its own      kind. (Male llamas, in fact, will fight to establish      dominance when kept together . . . though an unlimited      number of females - with a single male, if offspring      are desired - can be kept together without problems.)    </p>    <h3>CARE AND KEEPING</h3>    <p>      In their native South America, llamas obtain the bulk of      their food by grazing on the coarse grass found in the      semimountainous regions they prefer. Therefore, the beasts      will be more than satisfied with almost any pastureland you      can make available to them. Harlan supplements his animals'      foraged diets with an alfalfa (75%) and orchard grass (25%)      hay. And such "extra" rations would be absolutely necessary      in areas where the available pastureland is under snow      during the winter months.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, llamas <em>don't</em> need expensive      grain (although they enjoy having it as a treat once in a      while). Aside from forage, hay, and plenty of water, your      woolly charges will require only a few sticks to chew on      (to keep their teeth from growing too long, especially      during the cold months when the animals might not have      other access to such "chewy" fare) and a minimum of      shelter.    </p>    <p>      In mild climates, llamas can often find all the weather      protection they need underneath a grove of trees. A simple      three-sided shed will increase the animals' comfort, though      . . . and a more or less permanent structure will be      necessary in areas that typically experience wet, snowy      winters or very hot, dry summers.    </p>    <p>      Finally, a llama keeper should be certain to vaccinate his      or her animals against "blackleg" ( <em>Clostridium      chauvoei</em> ), and to worm them (check with your vet to      determine the appropriate anthelmintic) twice a year.      Otherwise, the "South Americans" are hardy and easy to care      for.    </p>    <h3>WORTH THE WAIT</h3>    <p>      As you'd imagine, the fact that llamas are valuable and      versatile animals is reflected in the price that they can      bring on the market. The cost can be as variable -      according to Harlan - as is the length of the wait      between ordering one of the beasts and actually taking      delivery. Prices range from $400 to $1,000 for males and      $2,500 to $3,000 for females. (The latter, of course, are      more valuable because of their ability to expand the herd.)    </p>    <p>      Since it's now illegal to import llamas from South America      - and because the demand for North American-raised      animals is steadily increasing - it can take as long      as two years to obtain a llama (especially if your      requirements of color, age, sex, etc. aren't flexible). In      many cases, however, it's possible to acquire an animal      within several months.    </p>    <p>      The limited availability of the beasts is due to a simple      lack of supply. Although a female llama can be bred at      three years of age, you see, the gestation period is a full      eleven months . . . only one kid is typically born at a      time . . . the little one will have to nurse for at least      four months . . . and the youngster will have to      <em>remain</em> with its parent for another four to six      months after weaning, before it can be sold. As you can      imagine, then, several years can be required to even double      the size of a herd. (However, llamas live for 20 years or      more, so once your herd is developed, it'll be around for      awhile!)    </p>    <p>      Of course, not <em>every</em> homesteader or ranch owner      will have a use for these strange-looking animals. But      folks who need reliable, sure-footed pack beasts . . . who      want to grow their own unique wool . .. or who simply want      to raise the animals to sell could hardly go wrong by      obtaining a llama or two. (As far as <em>I'm</em>      concerned, it'd be worth owning a few just to      <em>watch</em> them!)    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Harlan Harris (Dept.
