                <p>      <strong>You can expand your photographic horizons -      to increase the pleasure you can get from your hobby or the      profit you can earn from you home business - by      building...</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     By Janice Fryling</h5>    <p>      Not long ago, a friend (and fellow photo hobbyist) told me,      with no little pride, that he'd designed and built a      low-cost homemade enlarger. I congratulated him on his      ingenuity but - I confess - assumed that the      device was likely an interesting plaything rather than a      practical piece of photographic equipment. Therefore, when      it came time for <em>me</em> to have an enlarger, I      promptly made the rounds of my area's photo supply stores      to see what such establishments had to offer.    </p>    <p>      It soon became clear that I'd have to do one heck of an      enlarging job on my <em>budget</em> before I'd be able to      purchase one of the expensive pieces of equipment. I was,      as the saying goes, between a rock and a hard place. So      (extremely grateful that I'd kept my doubts about his      creation to myself) I called my picture-taking buddy and      asked him to tell me how he'd built his enlarger.    </p>    <p>      Well, to make a long story short, I wound up assembling      <em>five</em> of the devices before I felt I'd really      developed the design to its full potential. The fifth      enlarger, though, worked like a charm . . . and as an added      bonus, I believe I learned enough in the course of putting      my rejects together to tell <em>you</em> how to produce a      "perfect" blow-up-maker on your first attempt!    </p>    <h3>HERE WE GO</h3>        <p>      Before you begin work on your homemade enlarger, gather the      components shown in the accompanying photo: your 35mm      camera and a tripod (most such cameras come equipped with a      50mm lens, which will allow you to make 8" X 10" and larger      prints .. . a "macro", or close-up, lens will give you the      capability of making smaller prints, as well), a box of      aluminum foil, a scrap of plate glass, a cable release, a      corrugated cardboard box of about 4-1/2" X 4-1/2" X 10", a      roll of gray duct tape, an enlarging bulb (you can buy one      at almost any photo shop), and a translucent plastic milk      carton (a piece of which will be built into the enlarger as      a filter, to prevent "hot spots" from marring your photos).    </p>    <p>      Now, mount your camera on the tripod. with the lens facing      down, open the imagemaker's back, and set one small end of      the box on the opening. (This will enable, you to see how      well the box will "mesh" with the tripod/camera assembly      and to make modifications if necessary. For example, I had      to trim the carton a bit to accommodate some inconvenient      protrusions on my tripod!) When the components have been      "custom fit" to one another, remove the box and - on      the end that will rest upon the camera - cut out a      centered 1-1/2" X 2" rectangle. (The light will pass      through the hole and through the negative, projecting      - by way of the camera's lens - the enlarged      image on your photo paper.) On the opposite side of the      container, trace and cut out a hole large enough for the      socket of your light fixture (roughly 1-1/2" in diameter).</p>    <p>Once the openings are made, you can line the interior of    the box with aluminum foil (dull side out), taping the    reflective material securely in place. Then put the light    fixture in position and screw the enlarging bulb into the    socket from the <em>inside</em> of the box.</p>    <p>      Before sealing the container for good (it won't be opened      till the light burns out!), cut a 4-1/2" X 6" rectangle      from the plastic milk carton and - by making slits in      opposite sides of the box, slipping the plastic through      them, and holding it taut with tape - install the      homemade filter about halfway between the lowermost part of      the light bulb and the bottom of the box. With that done,      you have only to seal the container and cover its      <em>outside</em> with tapedon foil (shiny side <em>out</em>      ) ... before your homemade enlarger will be ready to go to      work!    </p>		     <h3>LET'S DO IT!</h3>    <p>      In order to use your new piece of equipment, you'll have to      make sure that the shutter of your camera stays      <em>open</em> . (On many 35mm cameras, the shutter      <em>can't</em> be held open without using a cable release      that can be locked - or taped down - to fasten      the shutter in its light-admitting position.)    </p>    <p>      With the camera mounted on its tripod, set your negative      strip on the open back and cover it with the scrap of plate      glass. Then put the enlarger in place, being sure that it      sits upright on the camera. I usually begin (after, of      course, assembling my standard dark room equipment . . .      including trays, chemicals, a "safe" light, and print      paper) by cutting a sheet of paper into test strips . . .      and then setting the camera's f-stop at f-8 and exposing      the "trial" bits of paper for ever longer periods of time,      increasing the amount of light by about four seconds with      each strip.    </p>        <p>      Once I've determined the optimum exposure time, I place a      full sheet of paper in position and turn on the light for      just the proper period to give me the best enlargement      possible (of course, the "perfect" exposure time      <em>will</em> vary from one negative, and one type of      paper, to another). My enlarger has a switch built into the      light cord, which allows me to turn the bulb on and off      when I please ... although you could, of course, simply      unplug the cord to accomplish the same thing, provided      you're careful not to move or bump the enlarger in the      process.    </p>		<h3>FINE TUNING</h3>    <p>      It's sometimes possible to improve the quality of the print      by varying your camera's f-stop: By adjusting the device to      a lower f-setting, you'll admit more light and thus      effectively reduce the time of exposure that's necessary.      (The latter option can be quite valuable, as some papers do      not respond well to long exposure times. On the other hand,      though, most cameras operate at their best at a given      f-stop . . . and - since this "prime setting" is      commonly around f-8 - that's how I routinely set my      camera.)    </p>    <p>      That's really all there is to it. If you're new to the      photo game, you might want to invest in a few lessons in      basic photographic techniques, but - once you've had      sufficient practice with your new enlarger - you can      be sure that it will really do the job.    </p>    <p>      And just how good a job will it do? Well, let's just say      that this former skeptic used her homemade device to      enlarge the pictures that accompany this article. Not too      bad, huh?    </p>
