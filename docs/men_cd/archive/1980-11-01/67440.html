                    <p><strong>PERMACULTURE... ECOSYSTEMS FOR THE    FUTURE</strong></p>        <p>      Our recent Plowboy Interview (in MOTHER NO. 62, page 16)      with biointensive gardener John - the California      horticulturist who produces surprisingly high yields of      vegetables on small parcels of land at his experimental      mini-farm - outlined a frighteningly bleak future for      agriculture and for food production in this country.      Jeavons revealed, in that article, his belief that the      earth is rapidly becoming a desert and losing its fragile      layer of topsoil at an alarming rate . . . while product      yields continue to fall despite the ever-increasing input      of energy that agribusiness methods demand.    </p>    <p>      And although this critical problem now occupies researchers      and ecologists all over the world, it seems - at      least up to this point - that only a few people      (Jeavons among them) have been able to present feasible      solutions to our current self-destructive system of      commercial agriculture. Therefore, everyone here at MOTHER      was excited to learn about Dr. Bill Mollison, an Australian      environmental scientist who has coined the term      "permaculture" to refer to his concept of a      self-sustaining, consciously designed ecosystem. Mollison      envisions regional systems containing integrated,      self-perpetuating plant and animal species . . . assemblies      that will literally operate themselves on the principles of      stable diversity, energy efficiency, low maintenance, and      high yield.    </p>    <p>      Unlike many other theorists and soothsayers, though,      Mollison has an armory of facts and evidence to support his      futuristic vision. In fact, the former university lecturer      now lives in a metaindustrial village called Tagari -      in the northwest corner of Tasmania - where he and      his colleagues are busily setting up and demonstrating      functional models of their ideas. Besides providing      inspiration for the hundreds of permaculture associations      that are springing up all over Australia, Tagari residents      have also formed their own seed company and the      Permaculture Institute . . . which is responsible for an      international consultation service. The community is also      training a team of designers, who are available - on      a consulting and teaching basis - to individuals,      public agencies, and disadvantaged groups. In short, Bill      Mollison lives what he talks about... and perhaps that's      what makes the Australian's arguments so convincing.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER had an opportunity to meet Bill Mollison recently,      when he visited our western North Carolina neighborhood on      one leg of his current world tour (which is being      cosponsored by the International Tree Crops Institute, the      Farallones Institute, the New Alchemy Institute, the      National Center for Appropriate Technology, and the World      Future Society). After the public lecture and workshop,      MOTHER staffers Larry Hollar and Jeanne Malmgren spent      several hours with the dynamic man, to delve more deeply      into the philosophy and techniques of permaculture. The      following transcript was edited from that encounter.    </p>    <p>      Whether you're an organic gardener, an ecologist, or      someone who's just plain concerned about the uncertain      future of commercial agriculture, you're sure to find      Mollison's insights fascinating . . . simply because      permaculture does seem to represent a viable way out of the      crisis in food production and supply that we're now facing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Bill, it seems ironic that      - being a native of a small, isolated island -      you're designing ecosystems that have <em>worldwide</em>      applications. You must have had years of agricultural      training while preparing for such a monumental task.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Actually, I haven't had a great      deal of institutional horticultural education at all ...      but I suppose my background has helped prepare me for my      current involvement with land systems.    </p>    <p>      I'm a sixth-generation Tasmanian, you see, so the peculiar      sort of dual marine/bush orientation - common to      natives of that land - is in my blood. Tasmania is      largely an agricultural state, but it also contains a good      bit of heavily forested territory. About half the island      isn't even yet fully <em>explored,</em> and I spent a lot      of my childhood trudging the uncharted areas.    </p>    <p>      I grew up very independently, and without much formal      training. My father died when I was 14, so I left school to      help run our family bakery. As a result, I escaped having      to spend a lot of hours in a classroom . . . and I think      such a <em>lack</em> of traditional education is almost      essential for anybody who does anything creative. Later in      life - at about age 37 - I <em>did</em> go to      the University of Tasmania and complete a degree . . . but      I did so mostly to develop a bit of mental discipline. I      also taught there, for some ten years, as a lecturer in      Environmental Psychology.    </p>    <p>      My <em>real</em> education, however, has come from the      variety of jobs I've held. For most of my life I've been      either a fisherman or a fur trapper. I also - at      different times - ran a market garden and a dairy.    </p>    <p>      I've been involved in wildlife and marine research, too.      For several years, I worked with the Wildlife Survey      Division of the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research      Organization, or CSIRO. We tackled Australia's large-scale      pest problems, such as the locust plagues and the rabbit      scourge. Following that job, I dabbled in fisheries      research for several years . . . mainly concerning the      estuaries between sea and fresh water, although I did a lot      of inland lake work as well. And then - at various      times - I've gone into the forest to become a true      bushman ... felling and milling trees, locating new forest      stands, and seeking new trails through the wilderness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And did all your contact with the      wilds have any effect on your perceptions of our modern      agricultural system?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Oh yes! Everything I did, either      in research or in fieldwork, indicated that there was      something fundamentally wrong with modern farming methods.      For instance, every problem I found in commercial      agribusiness was actually <em>caused</em> by the industry      itself. Usually - when a farmer called in the CSIRO      for a consultation - the results of our investigation      pointed the finger straight at the grower him- or herself!    </p>    <p>      As I saw the same situation occur time and time again, I      gradually came to the conclusion that most contemporary      crop-raisers must be doing things the wrong way. So my last      few years with the CSIRO were spent in the forest,      observing the plant and animal species on location . . .      and there I learned that everything in nature is      <em>self</em> -controlled and <em>self</em> -balancing.    </p>    <p>      You know, a lot of modern thought suggests that the planet      - as a living organismic - seeks to protect      itself by rejecting any species that causes it harm. For      instance, if cattle damage part of the earth, the harmed      region will respond by growing thorn bushes and poisonous      plants, thus rejecting the animals. Well, I think we      - the members of the human race - are      perilously close to being rejected by the earth in that      same way . . . and quite rightly so, since we've created      some <em>terrible</em> damage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How did you consolidate such      early observations into your theory of permaculture?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Well, I guess the germ of the      idea had been lurking in my subconscious mind for along      time. For instance, I remember writing in a diary,      <em>many</em> years ago, that we should be able to      <em>construct</em> environments. But the theory didn't come      to full consciousness until around 1969. I was thinking      about the whole business of energy and of my opposition      - as a conservationist - to strip mining,      deforestation, and other forms of earth exploitation . . .      and I concluded that it was time to devise a better way.    </p>    <p>      Actually, I guess it was rather a brave step to say, "Let's      <em>apply</em> the principles of environmental science to      our production systems." Up to that point, those principles      had been taught as <em>revealed</em> knowledge . . . that      is, a person would go into the forest, find relationships      among the species, and formulate a principle or a law based      on such observations. Then the individual had to      <em>show</em> <em>off</em> the "new" principle, so he or      she would say, "Look, everybody, this is how it works."    </p>    <p>      But no <em>one,</em> at that time, ever thought of taking      such a relationship and consciously <em>applying</em> it,      making it part of a design. The idea was a real mind twist,      something that caused an almost physical change within my      brain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How were your new ideas received      by traditional agriculturists?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Well, I can only say that there      was a stunned silence at first, since the concepts were      seen as being terribly radical. The ideas were      <em>intuitively</em> accepted very quickly, though, by      nonprofessorial people. And many of the enthusiastic      responses came from women. In fact, 70 to 80% of the      letters I now receive come from women . . . they seem to      see immediately that we've got something here. On the other      hand, scientists - male <em>or</em> female -      don't see, mainly because they're used to teaching a      passive and nonreactive system. Such individuals don't      teach reactivity, and they don't practice activity.      Everything is on the blackboard, and nothing is in the      garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Let's see if we can define the      whole idea of permaculture. Exactly what is your theory all      about?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> The word "permaculture" refers      to an integrated, self-sustaining system of perennial      agriculture . . . which involves a large diversity of plant      and animal species. A permaculture is really a completely      self-contained agricultural ecosystem that is designed to      minimize maintenance input and maximize product yield. In a      permaculture, little wheels or cycles of energy are set up      . . . and the system virtually <em>keeps itself</em> going!      Essentially, it's a living clockwork that should never run      down . . . at least as long as the sun shines and the earth      revolves.    </p>    <p>      I like to call permaculture a "humane technology", because      it's of human dimensions. By that, I mean that it deals in      a very basic way with simple, living elements . . . so it's      available to every man and woman. Permaculture doesn't      involve some sort of complicated technology, as does even      an electricity-producing windplant. Instead, it's a      bio-technology . . . which people can <em>intuitively      handle</em> .    </p>    <p>      After all, permaculture deals with living systems . . . and      since man himself is a living organism, he can readily      comprehend it. It's a concept that can be very easily      transplanted or given away to anybody, too. In that sense,      it can never be patented - because it's so readily      available - nor <em>should</em> the idea be patented.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How, specifically, is      permaculture different from <em>conventional</em> modern      agricultural techniques?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> I can say in a word how it's      different: It's consciously <em>designed . . . and</em>      that alone makes it something brand-new. There's no real      design in modern agriculture, you see . . . there doesn't      seem to be any evidence of planning or thought in it at      all!    </p>    <p>      The Chinese, for instance, have recently "modernized" their      farming methods - that is, they went from hand      tilling and fertilizing with natural manures to machine and      flame weeding and fertilizing with artificials - and      they increased their energy input by 800% in the process.      Now they've gone beyond <em>that</em> and are heading      toward an increase of 1,000%! And all that extra      expenditure of energy produced an initial yield growth of      only 15% . . . a figure that's now declining rapidly. In      fact, it now looks as though productivity might even fall      below its original level!    </p>    <p>      Here in the United States, all the established agricultural      systems - such as the wheatfields of Kansas, the      cornfields of North Carolina, and the orchards of      California - are aberrant systems . . . and they're      perishing as I speak. California, in fact, is rapidly      turning into a desert. Modern agriculture, you see, can be      summed up in only one statement: It destroys its own basis.      It has already destroyed 50% of the world's soil . . . and,      of the remaining 50%, about 30% will be disappearing in      very short order. The problem with today's agricultural      techniques is that-by ignoring the possibility of any      design input - they fail to deal with interrelated      functions.    </p>    <p>      One of the great principles of natural systems is that      diversity and stability are directly linked. And if you're      going to create a stable system - that is, one that      will survive - you must provide for some diversity      within it. Now creating diversity <em>doesn't</em> mean      simply putting a lot of different plants in your garden.      That's a diversity of species, yes . . . but it doesn't      make your garden necessarily a stable one. What      <em>does</em> create stability is a diversity in the      relationships between species.    </p>    <p>      And that is the basis of permaculture: to see how many      interacting relationships one can build into an      agricultural setup.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Besides providing a high number      of such functional connections, what are some of the other      goals of a permaculture design?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> As I mentioned before, the      system should be self-supporting . . . that is, it      shouldn't require the addition of any external energies to      operate. It should also be self-steering, requiring a      minimum of input from the designer after the design has      been implemented. Finally, it should enrich the people in      it, and they should enrich it. In short, a permaculture      should be nothing less than a Garden of Eden. Now that may      sound like a pie-in-the-sky goal, but I really believe it      to be an achievable objective for the whole world . . . and      the only things needed to reach it are human energy and      intellect!    </p>    <p>      Obviously, though, we'd just about have to reverse our      present mind set to bring about such changes. In fact, I      think a <em>revolution</em> in thinking would be the proper      word to use . . . in the same sense as Masanobu Fukuoka      uses it in his book, <em>The One-Straw Revolution.</em>      It's a move toward good stewardship of the earth      <em>and</em> toward a sane society. Our present society,      you see, is <em>in</em> sane, and the stewardship we      practice is horrific . . . in fact, we don't actually      <em>care for</em> our earth at all, but exploit our      nonrenewable resources and waste our renewable ones!    </p>    <p>      Permaculture, however, represents an educational process      that can lead us <em>away</em> from irresponsible thinking.      Anyone who works with a permaculture goes through a      learning experience that is complex and interdisciplinary .      . . the very things that traditional education is      <em>not</em> . In essence, it's an intellectual exercise.      Instead of wearing out our bodies in the garden, we use our      minds. For that reason, permaculture appeals to people who      normally wouldn't be interested in the hard physical labor      of gardening - especially double-dig gardening with      compost - since the real labor of developing a      permaculture is not in <em>doing it,</em> but in thinking      about what one is going to do. One's major energy, then, is      devoted to the initial designing of the system, not to the      maintenance of it.    </p>    <p>      There are two books that point the way toward this new kind      of thinking . . . and they are, in my opinion, the only      texts that should be issued to student agricultural      designers: Fukuoka's book, which I've already mentioned,      and a new volume - just published by Viking Press      - called <em>Entropy: A New World View</em> by Jeremy      Rifkin. <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: Turn to page 56 in this issue      for a closer look at Rifkin's work.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> In your own second book,      <em>Permaculture Two, you</em> introduced two ways of      looking at the land that were based on Fukuoka's principles      of nonviolent cultivation and natural farming. What are      those contrasting views, and how do they relate to your      work?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> The underlying philosophy of      permaculture is the same as Fukuoka's: working      <em>with</em> the land, not against it. It's essentially a      matter of using the principles of <em>Aikido,</em> the      Oriental defense art, on the landscape . . . allowing one      to turn adversity into strength and use that energy      positively. You're right, there <em>are</em> two very      distinct ways of looking at the land. One is to ask, "What      can I demand this land to do?" That viewpoint - which      is the prevailing philosophy of commercial agriculture      - can lead only to the use of force on the fragile      soil. A permaculturist asks instead, "What does this land      have to give me?" Anyone who asks that question will      naturally work in harmony with the earth to produce a      sustained ecology. That's what we try to do in      permaculture: We adopt a design or strategy that rolls with      the strengths and weaknesses of the land, to ultimately      make the system stronger. And achieving that goal will      naturally strengthen us, too, since our survival depends on      the health of the earth.    </p>    <p>      What practitioners of permaculture do, then, is cooperate      with the earth and avoid the use of force. In accordance      with Fukuoka's "do nothing" system of farming, we use no      machinery . . . no digging or slashing machines, which      would only disturb the earth and create an imbalance by the      introduction of force. And this is the point that I must      make time and again: If you use energy in any way      <em>non</em> productively, then you are causing a chaotic      condition, either in your garden or in your society.      Permaculture involves a thought process in which you design      systems to harmonize with nature, <em>not</em> to oppose      it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Let's talk some more about the      role of design in a permacultural system. Just how      important is it?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> It makes all the difference in      the world! Look at Fukuoka: That man, at 74, controls 12      acres at a higher productivity than any other farmer on      earth . . . and he does it all on foot, with no machines      whatsoever! And even his design could be improved upon. The      point is that, by applying any sort of temporal and spatial      pattern, one can literally achieve wonders in the product      yields of a system.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What are some of the design      criteria used in the formation of a permaculture? I mean,      exactly how do you go about planning one of these      microcosms?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> First of all, you take stock of      all the external factors that must be worked with -      such as climate, topography, soil, and water supply -      and then choose plant and animal species that are highly      suited to that particular set of factors. And this is the      point at which permaculture must radically differ from      commercial agriculture. If you want to - particularly      here in the Americas - you can sit down and design a      very productive piece of swampland containing people,      ducks, invertebrates, and so forth . . . because swamps are      naturally productive areas, and such a system will produce      a vast number of useful things. But modern agribusiness      experts would advise draining the swamp and making it into      a cattle fodder system! That's <em>far</em> too wasteful .      . . in effect, it turns a natural area of high productivity      into an <em>artificial</em> place of extremely <em>low</em>      productivity.    </p>    <p>      When you're developing the spatial design for a      permaculture, you literally start at your own doorstep and      work out from there . . . all the way to the horizon! The      ground plan - starting from the center, where the      dwelling and other principal buildings are located -      involves concentric zones, with each species placed so as      to maximize its usefulness in the ecosystem. The      arrangement should be based on the principle of greatest      accessibility: The species that need your attention or      control most often - for watering or harvest, for      example - are best located closest to the dwelling      site . . . while plants and animals that need little or no      attention are likely to be on the <em>periphery</em> of the      system. Zone placement, then, governs the energies that are      generated <em>within</em> the system, so that the whole      "structure" operates on the least amount of labor possible.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sector</em> placement, on the other hand, governs the      energies entering the system from the outside: both      disruptive forces like fire or flood . . . and beneficial      ones like sunlight and wind. Such factors can be either      screened out or filtered into the system, according to the      design. The aim is to channel external forces in such a way      that they'll efficiently serve the needs of an evolved      permaculture.    </p>    <p>      Now a fascinating concept comes into play here, called the      "edge effect". Ecologists have long recognized that the      area of intersection of two systems is a highly complex      - and extremely productive - region where      species from <em>both</em> systems can coexist comfortably      . . . along with other species that are peculiar to the      "edge" itself. Gross photosynthetic production is higher at      the interface, and this richness of plant and animal life      is very valuable to us as permaculture designers. So      - when we plan the zones and sectors - we try      to allow for a maximum area of interface between land and      water, tree and lawn, open country and dense vegetation.    </p>    <p>      That's the basic plan. Then - having set up the      zones, sectors, and interfaces - the designer tries      to make the highest possible number of functional      connections among the species he or she has to work with.      Each plant or animal should - in itself - serve      a number of functions, and it <em>should</em> also interact      with other species in a variety of ways.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Why is the principle of      multifunction so essential?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Because it's part of the      system's array of checks and balances. A single species can      operate in an almost infinite number of ways, you see, and      its yield is directly controlled by the designer's      discovery of all the ways in which it can function. His or      her imagination, then, can literally take the lid right off      what are commonly presumed to be the maximum possible yield      figures for any particular species.    </p>        <p>      Here's an example I like to use: I call it my chicken      model. Take four separate elements: a hen coop, a      greenhouse, a pond, and a small forest. Now you can have      these on your farm . . . and place them wherever you like,      in no particular relationship to each other. In that      situation each one functions individually, and they all      consume energy. But if you make the forest a forage range      for the chickens by putting the coop in or near that forest      . . . if you attach the greenhouse to the front of the      chickens' shelter . . . and if you set the pond in front of      the greenhouse - as illustrated in <em>Permaculture      Two</em> - well, then you've got a nice system of      interrelating functions, the familiar checks and balances.    </p>    <p>      Just look at all the ways you produce energy in this      system: the chickens' body heat, the direct sunlight that      reflects off the pond and hits the greenhouse, the      radiation of the trees at the rear, the decomposition of      chicken manure, and on and on. If you sit down and sketch      this system out, you'll find that it's fantastically      complex - with thousands of functional interactions      - and will <em>run itself</em> . Operating on its own      energy, the system automatically switches on and off. As      the sun gets high in the sky, the greenhouse absorbs more      heat . . . so the chickens get hot and go out, thus      removing the source of animal heat. While they're outside,      the birds forage in the forest and leave their manure to      enrich the soil. After dark, of course, they'll go back      inside to keep warm . . . taking their body heat with them.    </p>    <p>      Look at each chicken by itself and the variety of functions      it's performing in this one simple model: In the coop the      hen operates as a radiator, an egg producer, and a manurial      system. In the forest the bird acts as a self-forager, a      tree-disease controller, a fireproofer, a fertilizer      producer, and a rake. One can use chickens to do      <em>quantities</em> of useful work . . . in fact, I don't      know what you <em>can't</em> do with chickens, once you get      started!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> The idea, then, is to design an      ecosystem carefully . . . and once it's established, let it      function almost entirely on its own?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Exactly. The ideal, of course,      would be a system that requires <em>no</em> maintenance,      which is a really difficult possibility to accept. You      know, when the explorers and missionaries first landed on      this continent, they were shocked to find the natives      sitting indolently under trees . . . but the idea that you      have to work to live is a strange one to aboriginal people.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> But what about such concerns as      pest control?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Well, most of that problem is      solved by the very design of the system. Broadly speaking,      the diversity that is so important in permaculture is its      own most effective pest control. The greatest cause of      pests in monocultural cropping is the fact that farmers set      out a whole field of corn or soybeans, alone and      unprotected from the plant's natural predators.    </p>    <p>      But the functional diversity of a permacultural ecosystem      insures the operation of certain controls, since the      designer turns the naturally antagonistic and competitive      relationships among plants and animals to advantage. A      complex system - with a great variety of species      - is simply less susceptible to pest infestations      than is a single-crop system.    </p>    <p>      In our Tagari gardens, we use several different species to      deal with potential pest problems. Ducks, for example, are      effective against snails and slugs. In some areas of      Australia we have so many grasshoppers that people can't      garden without the pest-destroying help of guinea fowl . .      . so they have to site their plots within a guinea fowl      range. I also make straw and rock piles for lizards . . .      since the reptiles will eat some grubs that birds won't      touch.    </p>    <p>      Another predator that I encourage in my garden is the tree      frog . . . it will devour both cabbage moth larvae and pear      slugs. To attract the frogs, I simply make little ponds out      of shallow pits lined with plastic and hollowed-out tires.      I dig the ponds wherever I need them - near the pear      or apple trees and among the cabbages - then dump in      a couple of gallons of tree-frog tadpoles.    </p>    <p>      We've also found that mulch is effective against such      insects as cutworms. And, since most good mulches contain      many different kinds of fungi, the material provides a sort      of "battleground" in which harmful organisms simply eat      each other up. I think one has to play around with all      sorts of natural controls, as we've done . . . and will      eventually hit upon the ones that work best in a specific      area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Isn't there a tremendous      financial outlay required to set up a permaculture, with      such a diversity of species?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Well yes, the initial cost can      be steep if you're the only person involved . . . and at      one point I was. Originally, I spent about eight or nine      hundred dollars, in species purchases alone, to set up a      half-acre! But - once I was done - that piece      of land didn't cost another cent in equipment or      maintenance. So there's a rapidly decreasing financial      input involved.    </p>    <p>      The best way to establish a permaculture, though, is to      share the expense among a number of people. If you have      some sort of association, you can obtain the necessary      species at a low cost to each individual . . . and can also      share whatever species you already have with one another.      For example, I now find that one of my friends will already      have specimens of any of six or seven <em>hundred</em>      plant and animal types I might need.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Let's talk about houses and      buildings . . . what sorts of structures would fit into an      evolved permaculture?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Any buildings that are part of      an ecosystem should agree with that system's overall      principle of minimal energy usage. To that end, there are      basically two choices: One either makes adjustments to      existing structures, or constructs new dwellings.    </p>    <p>      The "reactive house" concept is one pattern that can be      employed to retrofit older dwellings. The aim of such a      design is to reduce - or even eliminate - the      need to use external energy for climate control. In this      sort of housing, outside windbreak plantings protect the      structure from cold winds . . . external walls are covered      with insulating vine crops . . . a solar-collecting      greenhouse is attached to the sunny side of the building .      . . all walls and ceilings are well insulated. . . and so      forth.    </p>    <p>      There are also lots of exciting things being done with      underground and earth dwellings. Furthermore - after      I finish my tour of the United States - I'm going to      visit a West German named Rudolf Doernach, who "grew" his      own house: a unique biostructure composed of an      igloo-shaped steel-and-timber frame that's grown over with      leafy evergreen vines. The building is heated with compost      . . . and it keeps the occupants quite warm, even in the      cold European winters! "Plant houses" like Doernach's      - which literally spring up out of the ground -      not only make useful human dwellings but can also provide      warm livestock shelters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Bill, so far you've referred to      permaculture only as a <em>rurally</em> oriented concept.      What relevance - if any - do your ideas have to      the millions of people who live in crowded nonagricultural      environments?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> I've done quite a lot of design      work in inner city areas, believe it or not . . . most      often with unemployment coops and community groups. Our      cities are really in a crisis situation, because they were      set up to exist only as dependents of physically distant      food-producing ecologies, and simply can't survive on their      own. So we'll have to do a fast job of designing in urban      areas if we're going to save the cities.    </p>    <p>      Actually, though, I find that - more and more -      inner cities are becoming surprisingly active agricultural      areas. Earlier in this trip, I worked in the Los Angeles      suburbs of Lynwood and Watts . . . and what I saw there      foreshadows what will be happening all over the world in      ten years. Those people are more likely to make an effort      to <em>do something</em> about their circumstances, because      they have an immediate need . . . the edge of the sword is      closer to them. Many inner city residents can't afford      petrol or food <em>today</em> - a situation that will      become all too common in other areas quite soon - so      they're <em>forced</em> to grow their own supplies now. As      a result, there are actually more gardens per capita in      Lynwood and Watts than in any other part of Los Angeles.      It's strange . . . the Third World exists <em>within</em>      the frontiers of the Western world, as well as without.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, I think we can reform the cities. I'd like to have      a chance to work on great, tall skyscrapers . . . they're      nothing more than huge, unused greenhouses that could      produce a <em>tremendous</em> amount of energy on their      own. It would be possible to grow a lot of useful crops in      such buildings . . . <em>and</em> in urban park areas that      are now used only for ornamentals. All sorts of      cluster-title and land-owning co-op systems could be      devised to allow more and more city dwellers to produce      their own food.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> In <em>Permaculture Two</em> you      stated that the only sane response to the insanity of our      postindustrial age is "to gather together a few friends and      commence to build the alternative, on a philosophy of      individual responsibility for community survival". Is this      the motivation behind the community you've formed in      Tasmania?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Indeed it is. I think that total      personal self-sufficiency is an extraordinarily stupid      approach to existence. We all need one another - as      individuals and as groups - to set up functional      interconnections. Human beings, you see, need what a garden      needs: a lot of diversity in functional relationships.    </p>    <p>      What we're working toward at Tagari is a system of      regionalism - based on our individual self-reliance      - <em>without</em> the defended boundaries so common      nowadays. Our group is rather small, but we maintain      multilocation activities: We're operating in deserts, in      tropical rain forests, in cool temperate areas, in the sea,      and in the cities. We believe that <em>all</em> the      elements of life on earth are interconnected. Not only is      no man an island, you see, but no <em>species</em> is an      island.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How big is your community?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> At the site where I live with my      family and friends, there are only eight of us. But we have      alliances with several other similar groups, bringing the      total number of Tagari members to about 30. And then we      have alliances with many hundreds of other groups in      Australia . . . publishing and distribution alliances,      training and design alliances, genetic species alliances,      and seed collection alliances. Through just this sort of      system of linking connections, we foresee the emergence of      what might amount to an alternative nation . . . which will      be <em>global</em> . But, of course, we can't let any one      of the units get too big, or it might become oppressive. If      that should happen, we'd have to drop it from the network .      . . and it would be unable to survive alone, without those      vital interrelationships.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Do you think there's an optimum      number of members, then, for the ideal community?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> That's an interesting question,      and the answer depends on what the function of a particular      community is. I would suggest that we begin in tiny groups      of five or six . . . but then these little units would      later need to coalesce into groups of 30 or so and make a      settlement. Finally, you'd need to form a larger tribe of      about 200, to insure enough genetic diversity for the      survival of the race.    </p>    <p>      So what I'm doing while I'm traveling on this tour is      setting up connections. I hope to leave a string of new      permaculture groups behind me as I go. The associations are      actually self-forming - all I do is introduce the      ideas and get them started - and self-run: There's no      central secretariat or anything like that. What we want is      <em>not</em> a bureaucracy, but an interconnected system of      functional links . . . such as seed exchanges and      reciprocal resource distributions. The associations can      operate very efficiently on their own. In fact, I don't      even know what most of them are doing . . . which is fine,      as long as they're out there putting things right.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Is Tagari open to new members?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Oh, sure. We'll accept up to 30      members at each location within the community . . . but we      plan to stop expansion altogether at a total size limit of      about 200 people. So it is open - for a finite period      - at several locations. We take in some seasonal      workers, as well. And we do have lots of interesting work      going on. Actually, functions are split <em>within</em> the      community: Some of us work in publishing the permaculture      books, others work in information dispersal, and I work      - along with several others - in design and      networking. In addition, a number of us are involved in      setting up alternate forms of property ownership. We now      have quite an active land bank system, through which we      acquire farms, houses, and other buildings and then parcel      out stewardship of the properties.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> And you're also educating      permaculture designers?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Yes, and they're trained to      design to the very limit of their intellect, to apply the      principles of functional connections to their plans. In      that sense they're a new breed, totally different from      traditional landscape architects or agricultural designers.      We plan to train them initially in Australia and then send      them out to teach regional courses to other people . . .      thus we'll be setting up an expanding pyramid of functional      design knowledge.    </p>    <p>      And it appears we're already making inroads into      traditional thinking patterns . . . 60,000 copies of our      books have been sold in Australia, and there are      permaculture associations popping up in every state of that      nation. The idea is also beginning to enter the      establishment, it seems, through the formal educational      system. One agricultural university and one technical      college now offer courses in permaculture. A lot of      "respectable" scientific associations are linking up with      us, too . . . they're giving themselves fancy names like      "Agro-Silviculture Institutes", but they're all actually      edging into permaculture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> It's great to know that some      minds are already being changed by the idea of permaculture      . . . but how can your group convince those who may not      have realized the value of your concept? That is, how do      you expect people to convert the prevalent belief in      high-energy, single-yield agriculture to an awareness of      low-energy, diverse-yield permaculture?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> I believe the key word here is      <em>commitment. Self</em> -government is the first thing      each individual has got to learn. Each person must make up      his or her <em>own</em> mind and make a commitment . . .      only <em>then is</em> he or she ready to go out and      convince others. Just before E.F. Schumacher died, he said      that our duty is to get our own house in order, and I      certainly couldn't put it any better than that. We all have      to start within ourselves and get our own houses in order .      . . and then we'll be ready to become <em>missionaries</em>      for order.    </p>    <p>      But if your house is in chaos and your doorstep is weedy .      . . well, then you can't be a very good missionary, can      you? In fact, man shouldn't leave this planet if he's going      to leave it in disorder, because he'll only carry his chaos      along with him . . . and he'll become the garbage strewer      of the universe.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> OK. Assuming that our race is      able to get its house in order, and we're ready to go out      and make the changeover to permanent agriculture . . . what      should be our first course of action?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> I think our <em>main</em>      responsibility is to set up a replacement for modern      agriculture <em>before</em> it collapses, instead of      waiting for its self-destruction. And the system will      certainly destroy itself . . . it's only a matter of time.      In fact, the end of commercial agribusiness is foreshadowed      in today's news stories. While I was in Los Angeles, I read      that agricultural "experts" foresee in the near future a      single crop - it will probably be the soybean -      from which all other foods will be derived. We'll only need      that one crop, they say. What a disaster! If that happens,      the powers that be will probably level all the mountains      and fill in all the rivers, just to set up the artificial      monoculture . . . and we won't have any diversity to build      on.    </p>    <p>      So I propose that we begin to build countersystems, based      on what little diversity is still left, <em>now</em> ! We      need to start - as quickly as possible -      gathering genetic resources and stacking them into the      right assemblies. We need to have some diverse systems      <em>already</em> functioning when conventional agriculture      collapses, so that we won't be destroyed. Because if we're      caught unaware, modern "agribiz" will be the end of a lot      else besides itself . . . it'll take most of the earth's      soils with it. However, if we start <em>now,</em> we'll be      <em>ahead</em> of the sublime blaze-out that's sure to      come.    </p>    <p>      We must also reorder our thinking, including our notions as      to which technologies are the "right" ones to use. We need      a simpler, biologically oriented technology. For every      machine you might invent, I could name a living thing that      would perform its function just as well. For instance, we      can pump water in or out of the ground with certain plants,      and we can completely control the climate of living spaces      with animals and plants . . . and <em>biological</em>      technology doesn't rip the earth to pieces as it works.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What do you think the future      would be like <em>without</em> the biotechnology of      permaculture?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> There is no future without it. .      . at least not for life systems. Our current highly      developed technology is leading us toward an      <em>inorganic</em> future . . . and man - a creature      of flesh and blood - wouldn't survive long in such a      world.    </p>    <p>      At this point, most people are still irresponsible . . .      and seem to be dangerously shortsighted when it comes to      their ability to perceive the immutable barriers that we're      bound to hit sooner or later. It's like that classic film      short <em>Godzilla vs. Bambi, you</em> know. Humankind is      flitting about carelessly - like the innocent Bambi      - consuming enormous amounts of energy with no      thought for the future. But Godzilla - those      inescapable laws of nature - is breathing down      Bambi's neck . . . the shadow of a giant foot, of the great      paw that will soon come down, hovers over him.    </p>    <p>      I think, though, that people <em>will</em> wake up as the      world goes deeper and deeper into disorder . . . as our      nonrenewable resources begin to disappear and Western      agribusiness begins to falter. Then they'll be clamoring      for someone to help put their world back in order . . . and      that role could, perhaps, be partly filled by permaculture      designers! Therefore, I foresee a few decades of high      <em>demand</em> for good designers . . . a period that will      last until the society regains its stability and becomes      selfsustaining.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> You think it's possible, then, to      reverse the damage we've already done? Do we still have the      potential to extricate ourselves?    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOLLISON:</strong> Obviously so, since we've      survived this far. We've got good genes! I mean, we      <em>must</em> have descended from along line of right      thinkers, or we wouldn't be sitting here. That's been the      course of human history, you know: You think right or      you're dead. So I believe we have the inherited      <em>capacity</em> to think right, behave properly, and      design a viable future for ourselves . . . we've just got      to start drawing upon our marvelous inheritance.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Members of the team of permaculture      design consultants are available for lectures, seminars,      and training workshops all over the world.
