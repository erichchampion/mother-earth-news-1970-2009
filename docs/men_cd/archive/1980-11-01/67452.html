            		    <p>      <strong>When the wintertime blues hit, don't say, "It's no      use." Instead, learn . . .</strong><br />    </p>    	 		<h5 id="byline">By Lee H. Arten</h5>        <p>      Snow is nice, so they say . . . "they" being the skiers,      sledders, snowshoers, and snowmen-makers of the world. But      for folks who don't fit into such categories, the lovely      white crystals can sometimes be a definite curse.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, snow has to be moved around a lot . . . in      the course of clearing it out of driveways and off      sidewalks, and shoveling it from steps and roofs.      Furthermore, it destroys traction and causes accidents. So,      as the drifts pile up, they bring some people down.    </p>    <p>      However, even a "snow scrooge" such as I can find a few      uses for the cold, icy material. For one thing, a snowbank      can serve as a "natural" freezer in case of such      emergencies as a power blackout (which would likely have      been <em>caused</em> by the snowstorm in the first place).    </p>    <p>      And, if you have a lot of snow (we've recorded as much as      117 inches in one season in our area of Michigan), you can      use a shovel and a little elbow grease to pile a foot-thick      layer of insulation up against your house . . . in order to      help keep the nest cozy even when you dial down. (Of      course, when spring comes around, you might have to shovel      some of that insulation away, or - better yet -      interest the local children in the fine spring sport of      throwing snow on sunny bare spots and betting on which pile      melts first.)    </p>    <p>      Here's another <em>practical</em> use for that wintry      blanket: Remember the garage floor you meant to sweep all      summer and fall . . . and didn't? Is all that dirt now      tracked through the house? Well, snow is a great sweeping      compound. Just wait for a mild day . . . throw a few      shovelfuls of snow on the cement . . . and push the flakes      out, right along <em>with</em> all the crud.    </p>
