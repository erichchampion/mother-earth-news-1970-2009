                    <p>      <strong>NOVEMBER</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>      DECEMBER</strong>    </p>        <p>      It's late autumn in the garden . . . sere leaves drift from      sleeping trees, soldiers of stubble mark harvested rows of      corn, Winesaps ripen and fall, and - while warm      afternoons occasionally stir memories of summer's heat      - the morning's white rime heralds winter's chill      kingdom. Draw close to your loved ones, and offer thanks      together for the bounty you've stored.    </p>    <h3>FRUIT EXPLORERS</h3>    <p>      One of the biggest bargains in horticulture - and one      that makes a dandy Christmas gift as well - is a      five-dollar membership in the North American Fruit      Explorers. NAFEX is dedicated to the exchange of      information - through its quarterly journal,      <em>Pomona</em> - on growing both the rare and common      fruits . . . from blueberries to papayas, peaches, and      persimmons. The society also has panels of folks who are      experts on many varieties of fruit, cultural topics, and      techniques. NAFEX members can draw upon this wisdom and      experience for just the price of a stamped, self-addressed      envelope.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to join NAFEX you can do so by sending $5.00      (the annual dues include a subscription to the magazine) to      Roy Walker, Dept. TMEN, Box 711, St. Louis, Missouri 63188.    </p>    <h3>USDA DISCOVERS ORGANIC AGRICULTURE</h3>    <p>      It's almost enough to make a believer out of a cynic! First      we saw the government supporting Integrated Pest      Management. (Copies of the USDA's Agricultural Handbook No.      512, "The Basic Principles of Insect Population Suppression      and Management", may be purchased for $10 from the      Superintendent of Documents, Dept. TMEN, U.S. Government      Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Get your local      public library to buy a copy.) Now - even more      surprising - the Department of Agriculture has      released a report on organic farming . . . and the agency's      conclusions <em>highly favor</em> wholistic techniques!    </p>    <p>      "Organic farming," as defined by the USDA, "is a production      system which avoids or largely excludes the use of      synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides, growth      regulators, and livestock feed additives. To the maximum      extent feasible, organic farming systems rely on crop      rotations, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green      manures, offfarm organic wastes, mechanical cultivation,      mineral-bearing rocks, and aspects of biological pest      control to maintain soil productivity and tilth, to supply      plant nutrients, and to control insects, weeds, and other      pests."    </p>    <p>      Using this definition in their selection process, the      authors of the report visited 69 organic farms in 23      states, studied similar operations in Europe and Japan,      interviewed organic farmers and "movement" spokespeople,      and so forth.    </p>    <p>      The investigators reported that the organic farms, while      somewhat more labor-intensive than conventional operations,      <em>used less energy</em> . . . and - although      conventional farms provided a greater economic return over      variable costs than organic ones did - when the      expense of the <em>detrimental</em> aspects of      chemical-intensive farming were included in the equation,      the economic advantage of conventional agriculture was      reduced <em>significantly</em> .    </p>    <p>      Of course, the USDA has a long way to go before it meets      the needs of America's organic gardeners and farmers, but      the first steps <em>are</em> being taken. Unless the USDA      reverts to the bad old days of Earl Butz, MOTHER-readers      can have <em>some</em> hope that at least some of their tax      money will be used to further - not hinder -      organic agriculture. To obtain your <em>free</em> copy of      this important study, write to Organic Farm Report, Office      of Governmental Public Affairs, Dept. TMEN, USDA,      Washington, D.C. 20250. Ask for publication      1980-0-310944/96, "Report and Recommendations on Organic      Farming".    </p>    <h3>APPLE POLISHING</h3>        <p>      Now that the apple crop is in, there's one <em>more</em>      task to be done in the orchard ... and it may even be the      fruit grower's most important duty: sanitation. If you want      to keep those winged and manylegged critters from chawin'      on next year's fruit, <em>now</em> is the time to take      preventive measures. And orchard cleanliness is      <em>particularly</em> important for gardeners who wish to      fight the "battle of the bug" without recourse to poisonous      sprays.    </p>    <p>      The main weapon to use in your orchard's defense is the      rake. Gather up all the windfall fruits and put them where      they'll do some good ... in the compost pile. Remove any      fruit that remains on the tree after leaf fall, too. Rake      up all of the fallen leaves, and - unless they've      been mildewed, in which case they should be burned -      add them to the to-be-composted material.    </p>    <p>      Collect and burn all prunings (bugs love to winter-over on      them) and surround the trunk of each tree with a twoto      three-foot-high mouse and rabbit barrier made of half-inch      mesh hardware cloth. Space the screening about three inches      from the trunk. And - after the area under every      fruit tree has been <em>thoroughly</em> cleaned up -      lay down a fresh hay mulch ... about six inches deep. Start      mulching a foot from the trunk, and extend outward to the      tree's drip line (under the tips of the widest branches).    </p>    <p>      Now is <em>also</em> the time to go through the nursery      catalogs to make your selections for spring planting.      Commercial orchards sell out their popular kinds quickly .      . . and the prized antique varieties (described in MOTHER      N0. 63, page 130) are <em>always</em> in short supply.      (Besides being sure of your first choices it you order your      spring trees this fall, you stand a good chance of avoiding      <em>next</em> year's price increases.)    </p>    <h3>GLEANINGS</h3>    <p>      Northwestern gardeners (and coastal New Englanders, too)      will find a treasure house of good information in Binda      Colebrook's fine paperback, <em>Winter Gardening in the      Maritime Northwest</em> . If you're interested in having a      four-season garden, you'll find minimum temperature      information, recommended varieties, and an excellent      section on winter gardening techniques. Send $5.00 to      Tilth, Dept. TMEN, Route 2, Box 190-A, Arlington,      Washington 98223. (By the way, membership in Tilth -      an association devoted to organic agriculture in the      Pacific Northwest - is a good buy at $8.00 a year.      The gardening information in the newsletter <em>is</em>      regional, but there's much of general interest, too.)    </p>    <p>      Finally - before the frost nips them - pot up      some of those chive and parsley plants for the kitchen      windowsill! There's nothing like fresh herbs on a cold      winter's day.    </p>
