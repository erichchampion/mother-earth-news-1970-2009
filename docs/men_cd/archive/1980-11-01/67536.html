    <p>
                        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who</em> -      <em>through their writing and research</em> -      <em>gave special meaning to the words "population",      "resources", and "environment" in the late 1960's. (They      also coined the term</em> coevolution <em>, and did a lot      to make ecology the household word it is today.) But while      most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in      the areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us</em>      - <em>for instance</em> - <em>have read Paul's      book</em> The Population Bomb <em>) . . . far too few      people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (research of the type that      tends to be published only in technical journals and      college textbooks.) That's why it pleases us to be able to      present - on a regular basis - the following      semi-technical column by authors/ecologists/educators Anne      and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">ENERGY: THERE AIN'T NO FREE LUNCH</h2>    <p>      Nothing enrages the oil companies' publicity hacks more      than the statement we've often made: "Giving inexpensive      and abundant energy to Americans today would be like giving      a machine gun to an idiot child." However, that view      - as much as it may conflict with the corporate      cheerfulness of the multinationals - simply reflects      our own concern about the energy-intensive assaults that      this society has launched (and continues to launch) upon      Earth's life-support systems (for a detailed discussion of      such problems, see "The Snail Darter and Us" in MOTHER NO.      57, page 128).    </p>    <p>      If humanity hopes to <em>preserve</em> the planet's vital      interrelated support systems (instead of paving them over      or plowing them under), two important decisions must be      made: How much energy should we mobilize, and <em>how</em>      should we mobilize it? Such decisions can be intelligently      made, however, only if one has a complete understanding of      the <em>costs</em> that accompany the benefits of each      energy technology.    </p>    <p>      It's a well-known economic principle that "there ain't no      such thing as a free lunch" . . . and that maxim applies to      the energy field as well. No source of energy - no      matter how clean or abundant it may be - comes      without its costs, which must be taken into consideration      right along with the technology's <em>positive</em>      effects. So, to guide you in the continuing debate over      energy use, we'd like to present a "score card" of the      liabilities of a number of potential power sources.    </p>    <h3>FOSSIL FUELS</h3>    <p>      The operation of our present energy economy depends upon      fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) . . . and there      are, as you know, a considerable number of liabilities      associated with their use. Occupational hazards -      such as coal mine explosions and the dangers involved in      drilling and transporting oil and gas - make such      combustibles rather nasty to mobilize.    </p>    <p>      The use of fossil fuels also incurs <em>direct</em> health      costs . . . primarily as a result of the air pollution      produced by their combustion. The greatest <em>overall</em>      liability of fossil fuels, however - and that which      poses the most immediate threat - is the negative      effect of their use on evironmental systems. The full      danger presented by oil spills is not yet totally      understood, but is certainly worthy of concern . . .      aquatic systems in the western U.S. will be damaged as      water is diverted for use in coal and oil shale operations      . . . and, of course, few human activities are more      <em>directly</em> destructive of the environment than strip      mining for coal.    </p>    <p>      Acid rains (which are a product of air pollution caused by      burning fossil fuels) are now threatening the lakes,      streams, and soils of vast areas . . . and the same      phenomenon will probably have an increasingly harmful      effect on future crop production and forest growth. Worst      of all, the by-products of petroleum combustion -      carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates -      have the potential to alter global weather patterns. As      physicist John Holdren has written, "A CO 2 climate-induced      famine, killing a <em>billion</em> people before 2020,      certainly cannot be ruled out."    </p>    <p>      Finally, it's impossible to ignore the <em>political</em>      liabilities of our dependence on oil: Current struggles      over supplies of that precious fuel could very well      escalate into World War III . . . an event that, obviously,      would be the <em>ultimate</em> public health and      environmental calamity.    </p>    <h3>NUCLEAR ENERGY</h3>    <p>      Nuclear fission shares some of the liabilities of fossil      fuels, but it also has unique problems of its own. The      ecological hazards of using atomic power are actually      <em>slight</em> : It has been shown - as we've      pointed out in previous columns - that ecosystems are      quite resistant to the effects of radiation, even at quite      high levels. The hazards involved in obtaining such fuel      are <em>also</em> relatively small, since fewer miners are      needed to extract uranium than coal . . . and the nuclear      fuel is mined in much smaller quantities than the fossil      product. In addition, the direct <em>health</em> threats      associated with routine operation of nuclear power plants      may actually be <em>smaller</em> than those associated with      burning fossil fuels (although this question has not yet      been adequately explored).    </p>    <p>      A major liability of nuclear power, though, is our      inability to estimate hazards from non-routine occurrences,      such as the narrowly averted disaster at Three Mile Island      (see "The Lessons of Three Mile Island" in MOTHER NO. 62,      page 148). Although the number of <em>immediate</em> deaths      from a major nuclear accident probably wouldn't total any      more than those resulting from the explosion of an LNG      (Liquid Natural Gas) tanker, nuclear power also carries the      <em>long-term</em> threat of lingering deaths from cancer,      and of making substantial areas essentially permanently      uninhabitable.    </p>    <p>      Another problem unique to nuclear fission is the disposal      of long-lived toxic wastes (which we discussed at length in      this column in MOTHER NOS. 54 and 55). Most experts      maintain that the dilemma <em>can</em> be solved . . . but      we haven't yet seen a viable solution. And the problem of      radioactive waste may prove to be <em>politically</em>      insoluble, anyway, thanks to the nuclear establishment's      now well-known incompetence and dishonesty. Because of      this, very few people may be willing to live near a nuclear      waste dump . . . even if there are solemn promises of      safety by the government.    </p>    <p>      Most important, nuclear power - like fossil fuels      - can have political consequences. The widespread use      of such energy would likely accelerate weapons      proliferation (see "The Threat of Nuclear Proliferation" in      MOTHER NO. 65, page 142) which could lead to atomic attacks      even by terrorist groups . . . a development that, once      again, could possibly contribute to the ignition of World      War III.    </p>    <h3>RENEWABLE SOURCES</h3>    <p>      Many people - in the face of such dangerous costs      - are rejecting combustion and fissile fuels in favor      of <em>renewable</em> energy sources . . . but even such      relatively benign technologies are, especially when      considered on any but an <em>individual</em> scale, not      without serious liabilities. (Although the "lunch" in this      case may be more palatable, it <em>still</em> isn't free!)    </p>    <p>      Of all our renewable resources, hydropower is the only one      that has been used on a scale large enough to project its      costs. Large dams literally wipe out the terrestial      ecosystems that end up under water, and the huge structures      can also have a substantial negative effect on agriculture      and fisheries (as has Egypt's Aswan High Dam).    </p>    <p>      The most <em>obvious</em> hazard of hydroelectricity,      though, is dam failure: Such a disaster would kill many      thousands of people. (In fact, we feel that having to      choose between living downwind from a nuclear plant or      downstream from a large dam would involve a tough decision,      indeed!)    </p>    <p>      Solar power doesn't offer a completely free lunch, either.      Most home applications of sun energy - such as space      and water heating - are certainly labor intensive      (which is clearly a plus for unemployment) . . . but that      very factor results in a high <em>occupational</em> hazard      per unit of energy produced.    </p>    <p>      The health cost of domestic solar usage is difficult to      compute, since it's necessary to calculate the number of      man-days lost in installing solar devices <em>minus</em>      those that would have been lost by those workers in      <em>non</em> solar employment.    </p>    <p>      Generation of electricity by central solar power plants      would also accrue health and environmental liabilities . .      . both as a result of procuring and constructing the large      amounts of equipment required, <em>and</em> of operating      backup technologies during those periods when storage      capacities weren't able to see the plants through extended      nonsunny intervals. Such power-producing plants would also      require enormous banks of solar collectors in desert areas      . . . and would operate, obviously, to the detriment of      fragile desert ecosystems.    </p>    <p>      Solar power via biomass (which requires growing large      quantities of plants for direct burning or for conversion      to liquid fuels) also presents a variety of costs.      Occupational accidents could occur in the harvesting and      conversion of the vegetable matter . . . the problems of      soil preservation - and perhaps of pest control      - that are associated with <em>any</em> form of      high-yield agriculture would certainly raise their ugly      heads . . . and, of course, land used for biomass would be      unavailable for food production (which could lead to      serious political consequences in this hungry world).    </p>    <p>      Most renewable energy sources are now used on such a small      scale that any hazards they might entail in wider      applications can - at best - be only      conjectural. Windplants, for instance, could have dangerous      structural failures . . . ocean thermal energy conversion      (OTEC) devices may leak their working fluids or eventually      alter seawater temperatures .. . and geothermal systems can      produce both air <em>and</em> water pollution. As you might      expect, such methods also present occupational hazards, and      they would have adverse environmental impact as a result of      the procurement of materials for their construction.    </p>    <p>      Nuclear <em>fusion</em> power has been widely hailed as the      newest "miracle cure" for our energy problems . . . but      that particular lunch, too, has its price tag. Fusion, if      it ever proves practical, could present a formidable      radiological threat, along with some occupational hazards.      Breeder reactors, another of the nuclear industry's pet      projects, <em>could</em> greatly extend the life of Earth's      uranium reserves. But such facilities share the liabilities      of nuclear fission plants . . . and may be even more      subject to both catastrophic accidents and diversion of      fissile material for bombmaking.    </p>    <p>      Conservation - on the other hand - is      considered by many people to be the cleanest, safest, and      most readily available "source" of energy now available to      us. Even that sensible option involves certain liabilities,      however. Sealing up houses to save energy only intensifies      such internal air pollution problems as cigarette smoke,      gas from cookstoves, solvents that evaporate from plastics,      and so forth . . . the production (and often the use of)      insulating materials also involves occupational and      environmental hazards. And lighter, more fuel-efficient      cars may be physically dangerous to drive. Truly      <em>no</em> lunch (not even a wholesome, carefully planned      one) is ever free!    </p>    <h3>COMPARING AND CHOOSING OPTIONS</h3>    <p>      It's important to note, however, that some options on the      energy menu are much more prohibitively expensive (in terms      of liabilities) than others. For instance, comparing the      occupational hazards connected with installing solar      collectors on roofs or the possibility of leaking fluid      from an OTEC system (on one hand) with the dangers of acid      rains or nuclear proliferation (on the other) is equivalent      to comparing the perils of catching the flu with those of      contracting lung cancer. While the precise      <em>quantitative</em> difference may be difficult to      measure (is the cancer a hundred times worse? a thousand? a      million?), only a fool would fail to recognize the      <em>qualitative</em> disparity.    </p>    <p>      In conclusion, then (at least when approached strictly from      a health-and-environment point of view), our best energy      options may lie in a combination of renewables, nuclear      fusion (provided the right technology for it can be found),      and strong conservation measures. Despite their      liabilities, those choices present a path that is generally      safer - and more sustainable - than that of      fossil fuels and nuclear fission.    </p>    <p>      There are, however, other important criteria to bear in      mind when making energy decisions . . . which we'll discuss      in our next column.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>A detailed discussion of the health and environmental      effects of energy technologies can be found in</em>      Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment <em>, by      Paul R.
