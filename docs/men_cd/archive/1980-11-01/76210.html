                        <p>      Good sound entrepreneurial advice is a commodity that's      getting harder and harder to come by in these days of      economic uncertainty. For that reason, MOTHER offers the      following column by Dan Ogden (a fellow who launched his      own multimillion-dollar venture in 1976 with a shoestring      investment of $850!) . . . to provide all you aspiring      businessmen and -women with the hard-facts kind of      information you need to start a new enterprise (or keep an      old one running) and to realize the fulfillment that can be      had from operating your own business!    </p>        <p>      Too many "greenhorn" shoestring businessfolk are      alternately fascinated and terrified by the "glamour" of      advertising ... probably because the "ad game" is one of      the most <em>misunderstood</em> aspects of running an      enterprise. And it's also the area where a first-time-out      businessperson is most apt to make mistakes (usually costly      ones), often due simply to a misconception of the      <em>purpose</em> of advertising. An entrepreneur can get      caught up in the excitement of seeing his or her name in      print, and start an ill-fated ad campaign without      understanding even the fundamentals of good advertising!    </p>    <p>      As a commercial advertiser (one who uses ads to sell a      product), your ultimate goal is twofold: First, you want to      discover the unique advantages) of your goods or service .      . . and second, you want to <em>express</em> that      advantage, giving your customers one or more good reasons      to <em>try</em> your offering. To help you achieve that      aim, I'm going to present seven basic rules of advertising      that should enable you to avoid the most common pitfalls.    </p>    <h3>MOVE SLOWLY</h3>    <p>      The first principle is, strangely enough: <em>Put all      advertising off until your business has established      itself</em> . Now I realize that may seem a little      self-defeating, but it's actually a sound piece of advice      for the fledgling entrepreneur to follow. As I mentioned at      the beginning of this column, it's all too easy to get      hooked by the glamour of the ad game and crank up a      <em>massive</em> campaign before even you are thoroughly      familiar with your product. You need to understand, and be      in close touch with, your market before you advertise.    </p>    <p>      Talk to your customers and ask for their reactions to your      business. Such an informal survey will tell you more about      their preferences than would any large-scale marketing      research project. After you've been in operation for a few      months, you'll probably be able to pinpoint the precise      features of your product that make it unique in your area      <em>and</em> that appeal most to your clientele. At that      time, you'll be better able to catch the public's eye with      a well-directed ad.    </p>    <p>      Remember, though, that advertising is <em>not</em> some      sort of magical trick that will induce a consumer to buy      (repeatedly) a product he or she may not even want, as the      popular myth seems to suggest. Sure, lots of people, after      seeing an ad, buy an item they normally wouldn't have tried      ... but there's no advertisement in the world that could      convince that same person to buy the product <em>again</em>      if he or she wasn't satisfied with it. And that point      brings us to the second law of advertising: <em>The goal of      any ad is to get the prospective customer to try the      product or service at least once.</em> After that initial      lure, the quality of the goods <em>themselves</em> must      keep the consumer interested.    </p>    <h3>WRITE IT YOURSELF</h3>    <p>      My next rule may sound crazy - or maybe even      <em>suicidal</em> - to most beginning entrepreneurs,      but I firmly believe that it's good counsel: <em>Don't hire      an agency to write copy for your ad</em> ! Most small      businesses can't absorb the expense of a professional      advertising contract . . . and agencies often turn out      unsatisfactory ads anyway, since the employees of such      outfits tend to concentrate more on entertaining the reader      with "creative" approaches than they do on <em>selling your      particular product</em> .    </p>    <p>      Since you know your customers better than anyone else, who      could be more qualified to write an ad that's directed to      those persons? So forget all the silly, nonsensical      advertising gimmicks you've ever seen (like white tornadoes      and little men who row around in toilet tanks) ... and      write a simple, straightforward presentation of the reasons      you think someone should try your product!    </p>    <p>      Artwork, on the other hand, is an entirely different story.      In fact, here's my fourth precept: <em>Hire an artist</em>      . I'm not trying to discourage you from doing your own      illustrations (especially if you happen to have talent with      a pen or brush) . . . but I think you'll probably find that      a professional artist can help you design a <em>clear</em>      ad. The function of art in advertising, after all, is to      enhance and reinforce the message that's being presented in      words . . . so the design must not overwhelm the copy.      Beware, though, of allowing the art staff of a newspaper      (or of the Yellow Pages) to design your ad (even though      such publications may offer that service free of charge),      or your presentation will end up looking like every other      advertisement on the page.    </p>    <h3>STEADY STATE</h3>    <p>      Once you've formulated a good ad, you might be tempted to      change it after it runs a few times. Well, try not to      succumb to that temptation. Rule 5: <em>Be</em>      <em>consistent</em> ! Even if you get an idea that you      think is better than the original, or are worried that the      public is getting bored with your ad, don't change it.      Consistency is vital in an advertising campaign . .. not      only to establish a strong identity (which, of course, is      particularly important for a <em>new</em> business      concern), but also to implant your message firmly in the      readers' minds. An ad has to appear <em>many</em> times      before it's fully "digested" by its readers. In fact, a      number of potential customers won't notice even a      <em>full-page</em> ad the first few times it runs . . .      they may be distracted by another ad, they may just "tune      it out" because they're not in the market for that      particular product, or they may not have time to read the      piece. Whatever the reason, most people need to see an ad      <em>many</em> times before its message really sinks in.    </p>    <h3>HOW MUCH AND WHERE?</h3>    <p>      The last two principles of advertising concern the      expenditures for, and placement of, your ads. Some      businesspeople say you shouldn't spend more than 10% of      your profit on advertising . . . but I don't particularly      cotton to such rules. In my own dealings, I tend to be      conservative, so I start by running small ads until the      product proves itself. In contrast, other entrepreneurs try      large, splashy ads right away. The thing to remember here      is simply this: <em>Know what</em> <em>kind of advertising      risk you can afford, and then "go for it"</em> !    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that the physical placement of an ad is      often the crucial factor that decides whether or not it      will be seen. In fact, a small ad in a good position is      usually <em>much</em> more effective than a large message      that's stuck in a bad location. <em>The top right corner of      a right-hand page is generally considered the most      favorable position for an ad</em> . (If the advertising      salesman insists that no such corners are available, tell      him you'll wait . . . and you may be surprised to see how      quickly that space will open up!)    </p>    <h3>NO HARD SELL . . . JUST THE TRUTH</h3>    <p>      Finally, let me explain why the advice I've offered here      probably seems a little ho-hum in contrast to the      high-powered hype typical of Madison Avenue. I haven't      revealed any razzle-dazzle,      grab-your-reader-by-the-scruff-of-the-neck know-how ...      simply because that's not the real key to advertising. If      it's going to succeed at all, an ad for <em>any</em> small      business must be good, honest material.    </p>    <p>      A few years back, the Avis Rent-a-Car company hired an      agency to create a new national campaign for its faltering      business . . . with the single stipulation that all of the      ads be honest. The agency isolated two facts about Avis:      that the firm was number two in its field, and that the      management claimed it was willing to work harder to satisfy      its customers. Well, you know the rest . . . the ad      campaign based on those two simple (although dull) facts      was so successful that Avis began making a profit for the      first time in 13 years!    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Dan's entrepreneurial activities will,      he's found, keep him too busy to continue writing this      column on a regular basis.
