        Handcranked grain mills offer you freedom from both overprocessed flours and the electric company. And you'll appreciate the wholesome edibles that will grace your table. FROM LEFT TO RIGHT are shown three approaches to home milling: C.S. Bell's smallest steel buhr mill, the No. 2 . . . and Bell's larger version (cranked by hand or powered by a motor), the No. 60, for farm-scale operations.
