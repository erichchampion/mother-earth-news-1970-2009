                    <h5 id="byline">      By Erica Rowe</h5>    <p><strong>You can "sweeten" the festive season -      naturally - by baking one (or all!) of      these...</strong>    </p>        <p>      My family is trying faithfully to make the switch to a diet      of natural, unrefined foods . . . but - in spite of      our good intentions - it's all too easy to want to      backslide during the holiday season. It seems that      temptation is especially strong at this time of year,      because many of our memories of <em>past</em> Thanksgiving      and Christmas celebrations center on food: delectable      mincemeat pies ... warm, oven-fresh gingerbread men . . .      sweet fruitcakes . . . and peppermint candy canes hidden in      stockings. The holidays just aren't quite <em>complete</em>      without some traditional goodies, and we're apt to feel a      bit cheated if we don't enjoy at least one sugary morsel.    </p>    <p>      So, to ease my family's "withdrawal" pains (which are      particularly hard on the children), I invented several      <em>natural</em> , sugarfree holiday treats. Since the      delicious bread recipes printed here contain only      nutritious whole grains and natural sweeteners, merrymakers      can enjoy them with a clear conscience. What's more, my      two-bowl mixing method is so easy that you can get the      whole gang involved in the culinary process . . . and that      sort of group activity is a real "holiday helper" in      itself, since half the fun of the festive time of year is      the special spirit that results from doing things as a      family.    </p>    <h3>PUMPKIN BREAD</h3>    <p>      This sweet bread will be only as flavorful as the fruit you      use to prepare it . . . so find a <em>small</em> pie      pumpkin that's been field ripened and has thick, dark      flesh. Wash and dry the outside, then cleave it in half and      carefully scoop out the seeds. Place both halves (cut sides      down) on a cookie sheet, and bake them at 350°F for      about an hour . . . or until the meat is <em>very</em> soft      (you can test it with a fork) and the rind is somewhat      browned. After the pieces cool, scrape the pulp from the      shells with a spoon and purée it in a blender (or      put it through a food mill). Now the pumpkin is ready to be      used in my "pet" recipe.    </p>    <p>      To begin, grease a standard (3-1/2" X 5" X 9") loaf pan      with cold-pressed safflower oil, and dust it tightly with      whole wheat flour. Then - in the first mixing bowl      - blend 1 egg with 1 cup of maple syrup and 1/2 cup      of safflower oil . . . add 1 cup of the cooked,      puréed pumpkin . . . and beat the ingredients well.    </p>    <p>      Using a second - larger - container, mix 2 cups      of whole wheat flour (don't sift it, or you'll lose the      bran), 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, 1      teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon each of cloves,      nutmeg, and baking powder. Stir the contents of the first      bowl into the dry ingredients in the second, and then add 1      teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 2/3 cup each of      raisins and chopped nuts. Pour the batter into the pan, and      bake it at 350°F for 45 minutes ... then turn the oven      down to 300°F for <em>another</em> 45 minutes. Cool the      bread in the tin before removing and slicing it.    </p>    <h3>BANANA NUT BREAD</h3>    <p>      You'll need four or five <em>very</em> ripe (soft!) bananas      to make this delicious loaf . . . so it's best to keep the      fruits at room temperature for several days <em>before</em>      you plan to start cooking. When you're ready to make the      bread, cream 1/3 cup of butter with 1 egg and 1 cup of      maple syrup . . . and, once those ingredients are well      blended, add 1 cup of mashed bananas.    </p>    <p>      Then - in another bowl - mix together the dry      ingredients: 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 3 teaspoons of      baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2      teaspoon of sea salt. Slowly stir the banana-egg-syrup      mixture into the flour, and add 1 cup of chopped walnuts.    </p>    <p>      Pour the batter into a well-greased loaf pan (of the same      size as that used when preparing Pumpkin Bread). If you      want the finished creation to have an even top, use a knife      to "mound" the batter slightly around the edges of the pan      (since it tends to rise faster in the center). Bake your      confection for 25 minutes at 350°F . . . then at      300°F for another 30 minutes (or until a toothpick      inserted in the bread's center comes out clean). If you let      the banana nut loaf cool slowly in the pan, it will slice      more easily . . . but we usually can't wait, and divide up      the fragrant bread as soon as it comes out of the oven!    </p>    <h3>CRANBERRY NUT BREAD</h3>    <p>      To make a tart and tasty dessert treat, mix together 2 cups      of whole wheat flour, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 1      teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Cut      1/4 cup of butter into the dry ingredients until the      mixture has the texture of cornmeal.    </p>    <p>      In the smaller bowl, blend 3/4 cup of orange juice with a      well-beaten egg and 1/2 cup of honey. Then pour the liquids      - all at once - into the dry ingredients, and      stir the resulting mix only enough to blend everything well      before folding in 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1 cup of      fresh, chopped cranberries.    </p>    <p>      Finally, pour the batter into a well-oiled loaf pan, push      it up slightly around the sides, and bake it for an hour at      350°F. The youngsters may be dubious about the "new"      dessert at first . . . but after one slice, they'll attack      the bread with such enthusiasm that you'll probably have to      make another loaf before the holidays are over!    </p>
