        <p id="byline">Here's a moneysaving idea that may prove to be an energy-saver as well!</p><p>I don't know about you, but some of my best ideas occur to me at the oddest moments. For instance, while sitting in my car as it idled in front of a stop signal not long ago, I suddenly realized that - in all my years of driving - I had seen only one burnt-out traffic light!</p><p>Now city folks may be able to boast a better "sighting" record, since I tend to stay clear of overinhabited places whenever I can.</p><p>Nevertheless, I have spent my share of time stopped at lighted intersections . . . and I've still witnessed only that <em>one</em> bad stoplight.</p><p>But, you may wonder, what is the point of this discussion? To state it simply, I've discovered a way to obtain secondhand light bulbs . . . free!</p><p>Traffic light crews, you see, are very efficient. They tend to change signal bulbs long <em>before</em> the units are expected to burn out. So all I had to do was find out what was done with the still-useful <em>replaced</em> lamps, and get my hands on a few of them.</p><p>Less than a week later, while driving through town, I found my answer. A workman stood on the corner, preparing to change the bulbs in a traffic signal. Recognizing the situation as a golden opportunity, I pulled over and asked about the fate of the bulbs. The man informed me that they were taken back to the city's administration offices and that - from there - people generally took them home . . . even though the bulbs were an odd size (69 watts).</p><p>The next thing I knew, he'd handed me a dozen half-used 69-watters! I drove away delighted . . . knowing I was helping to recycle used materials, and that I'd be saving energy by employing the lower-wattage units in my home.</p><p>And now perhaps <em>you</em> can tap into this source of "free" light, too. After all, aren't great ideas meant to be shared?</p>
