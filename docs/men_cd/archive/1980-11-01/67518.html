                <p>      <strong>This southern Illinois couple built their home      to</strong> <strong>. . .</strong><br />    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Jim Murphy</h5>         <p>      When Carla and Paul Yambert moved into their solar- and      wood-heated, earth-bermed home in mid-1979, they regarded      the event as yet another part of a lifestyle that has      - through the years - increasingly translated      the couple's eco- <em>philosophy</em> into actual      <em>living</em> in accord with nature.    </p>    <p>      The Yamberts have always been lovers of the outdoors      (Paul's an environmental studies professor at Southern      Illinois University), and they raised their family in the      woodsy setting of Shawnee National Forest, which runs      across Illinois's southern tip. Though the couple found the      locale to be ideal, their original dwelling was fairly      conventional . . . so - when the youngest child left      home - the senior Yamberts began building the      smaller, tighter, more ecologically sound, and more      self-sufficient nest they'd been planning for years.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the most fascinating (and instructive) feature of      the Yamberts' new home is the manner in which it combines a      <em>variety</em> of existing technologies and materials to      provide both efficiency and comfort. Nestled into a      south-facing hillside for natural insulation, the house      also makes good use of passive solar techniques, relying      - for storage - upon the thermal mass supplied      by a huge stone fireplace that's heated on the outside by      the sun and on the inside by wood.    </p>    <p>      The extensive insulation, a solar greenhouse, two heat-lock      vestibules, and - of course - the earth      sheltering help the sunwood combination provide      <em>all</em> the building's space heating. And other      systems - including a cistern and a composting toilet      - allow the couple to further reduce the burden they      place upon nature.    </p>    <p>      Now that the house and its occupants have completed a      year-long "shakedown cruise", Paul and I - I'm a      university colleague with a long-term solar infatuation of      my own - both feel compelled to share the story of      this success with MOTHER's readers. What's more, since we      can take advantage of 20/20 hindsight, we'll pass on a few      suggestions <em>and</em> cautions to help other folks who      might embark upon similar projects.    </p>    <h3>QUALITY CONSTRUCTION</h3>    <p>      The rectangular house - which has a shed-style roof      - is a sturdy structure containing 1,360 square feet      of floor space . . . including the loft. Its quality of      construction far exceeds that of today's average frame      building: Consider, for example, that the exterior walls      were built from 2 X 6 lumber on 16-inch centers . . . or      that the main floor is slate (a material which doubles as a      second heat sink) . . . and that rough-sawed cedar siding      is used extensively inside and out.    </p>    		<p>      The way in which the building is insulated also sets it      apart from most conventional structures. Part of the      dwelling's insulation is natural: On the north (uphill)      side, the house is set into the earth nearly to its roof      line. The side walls, however, are made of concrete blocks      filled with vermiculite, which are - in turn -      backed with two inches of polyurethane on the outside and      two inches of fiberglass on the inside . . . for a total      R-value of about 24. Furthermore, the wooden walls have six      inches of fiberglass and the ceiling has 12 inches of batt      (with even <em>thicker</em> insulation in the critical      heat-retention area above the fireplace).    </p>    <p>      The Yamberts employed a conventional builder to undertake      what they considered to be the basic elements of the home's      construction, but wound up doing much of the work      themselves anyway. Looking back, they realize that the      preconceptions held by the average contractor can be of      significant disadvantage to folks who are trying to build      in a more ecologically sound fashion. As Paul aptly put it,      "The professional isn't sure whether your variations on      standard techniques are the result of cleverness or      stupidity, so he or she tries to change them back to comply      with the rules of normal procedure . . . and then -      to avoid embarrassing you - doesn't tell you what was      changed."    </p>        <p>      Such an incident almost occurred during construction of the      Yamberts' bathroom. Because standard building practice is      to put the toilet between the bathtub and the sink, the      contractor took it upon himself to change the locations      that the couple had specified for the water supply,      <em>and</em> for the "stool's" vent pipes. However, the      composting toilet <em>needed</em> to be placed directly      over the huge decomposition unit that had <em>already been      built</em> under the house. (And for that matter, a      "fermenting potty" doesn't require any water supply lines      to begin with!)    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, the owners caught the mistake in time to      correct it, but they found it necessary to keep a constant      eye on the builder to avoid having their      <em>innovations</em> replaced by the exact outmoded      procedures they were trying to get away from!    </p>    <h3>ENERGY CENTER</h3>    <p>      The fireplace's huge column of rock - located in the      middle of the structure - is the main component of      the home's heating system. Outside air, for combustion, is      drawn into the unit through ducts in the floor, and the      firebox is equipped with glass doors and a special thermal      grate - a Martin Octotherm - which pumps the      warmed air back <em>into</em> the room.    </p>    <p>      Additionally, the heat that rises through the large flue is      captured and piped down into a 2-1/2-foot-deep rock storage      area located beneath the building's six-inch concrete      foundation. A six-inch-diameter pipe transmits the air in      the flue, and four-inch ducts carry the warmth to the      stones beneath the floor.    </p>    <p>      At present the system is operated by means of a 1/24-HP      blower, but the Yamberts have discovered that their system      is both undersized and underpowered. "We didn't adequately      estimate how <em>buoyant</em> the hot air would be ... how      much it would resist being pulled down," Paul says.      Consequently, the owner/designer now recommends that anyone      duplicating the idea use 12-inch pipe in the flue, six-inch      ducts in the floor, and a 1/2-HP fan.    </p>    <p>      The Yamberts realized, from the beginning, that their      fireplace wouldn't be quite as <em>efficient</em> as a      stove, but they wanted to be able to sit before the open      hearth. Now, however, Paul concedes that a fireplace      <em>insert</em> may be added soon. It's not that the system      has failed to keep them warm . . . but that he feels he had      to cut too much wood to maintain a comfortable temperature      during 1979-1980's mild winter.    </p>    <p>      Of course, in addition to providing a cheery blaze in the      main room, the fireplace furnishes ample heat to its      "Blazing Showers" water warmer (which the couple read about      in MOTHER NO. 42). During the wood-heating months, the      setup has proved itself more than capable of supplying all      the household's hot water needs, and the backup electric      unit seldom comes into play. (In fact, since they recently      installed a pair of Solarcraft solar collectors for summer      water heating, the Yamberts believe that they could get      along entirely <em>without</em> the watt-powered standby.)    </p>    <p>      The south wall of the home is made up of an expanse of      double-insulated glass which allows the winter sun to shine      deep into the house and bake into the stone fireplace. Paul      and Carla got a bargain on their glazing by locating      factory-sealed double panes <em>without</em> any casements,      and building their own frames. If he had to do it again,      though, Paul says he'd probably go against conventional      wisdom and use single pane glass backed up by heavy      insulating curtains . . . simply to save more money.    </p>        <p>      The home's location (and the placement of its porch and      eaves) was planned to <em>capture</em> the winter sun and      <em>reject</em> the summer rays. Specifically, the Yamberts      designed their structure to take full advantage of solar      heat . . . from one week before the fall equinox to one      week after the spring equinox. The eaves provide midday      shading when the summer sun is high, and the entrance      vestibule (east) and the greenhouse (west) were positioned      to protrude from the front of the building for extended      early morning and late afternoon sunshine control.    </p>    <p>      And, in day-to-day use, the siting of the structure has      been even more effective than Paul and Carla had expected.      In fact, last <em>winter</em> they were surprised to find      that they were often getting more solar heat than they      needed. So, halfway through the cold season, they installed      reflective Mylar-faced fiberglass shades . . . which can be      pulled down to regulate the amount of light entering the      house.    </p>    <p>      With the sun warming the outside of the rock and the fire      heating it inside, the thermal storage of the fireplace      "core" kept the interior of the Yamberts' home cozy      <em>throughout</em> the winter last year. . . despite      temperatures that nudged zero on occasion. (Of course, the      home's heat-lock entries also helped to keep the structure      from losing BTU ... and the greenhouse did its part by      capturing some additional solar warmth on its own.)    </p>    <h3>WATER AND SEWAGE</h3>        <p>      Paul and Carla were particularly concerned - while      planning their home - with the problems involved in      gathering and disposing of water. Rather than go to the      expense of drilling a well, they opted for a cistern . . .      which is fed by the entire expanse of the structure's roof.      And the system has provided the couple with plenty of      domestic water . . . largely because their Clivus Multrum      composting toilet greatly reduces their demand for the      precious liquid.    </p>    <p>      The local health inspector agreed to the installation of      the toilet, but initially demanded that a septic system be      installed to treat the "gray water" from the bathroom and      kitchen . . . despite the fact that all solid garbage would      go into the composter. The Yamberts talked with the      official for several months (during which time "the man      educated himself", as Paul puts it) and eventually got him      to agree to a gray-water system consisting of two 50-foot      lengths of drainage pipe, surrounded above and below by a      foot of gravel and covered by topsoil. The ditches -      dug ten feet apart - have proved more than adequate      for returning soapy liquid to its pure state, and have done      so at low cost and with minimal impact on the environment.    </p>    <h3>THE RIGHT PRICE</h3>    <p>      Paul and Carla have spent an estimated $38,000 on their      home to date. Now most conventional contractors would say      that a house of such quality just can't be constructed for      $28 per square foot. But the Yamberts have not only built      their home for just that cost, but also realize a      significant saving each time their utility bills arrive!    </p>    <p>      Such expenses, throughout the year, average between $20 and      $25 per month. And that price includes the cost of      operating the backup water heater, a clothes washer and      dryer, a refrigerator, a range, lights (mostly      fluorescent), assorted small appliances, and the water pump      for their cistern.    </p>    <p>      Though the Yamberts are obviously not displeased with the      <em>economic</em> benefits provided by their new home, they      still like to touch back on their <em>philosophical</em>      intentions behind the project. The couple often talk about      adapting to nature, rather than forcing the environment to      bend to their whims.    </p>    <p>      Sure, they could have made the house <em>easier</em> to      live in: Each day they open and close shades in cycle with      the sun . . . and chopping and toting wood are regular      chores. But, by constructing their house without a backup      heating system, the two people have intentionally tied      themselves intimately to nature. "That underlying      philosophy is very important to us," says Paul. "We want to      make our own bargain with the environment . . . our own      private arrangement."    </p>
