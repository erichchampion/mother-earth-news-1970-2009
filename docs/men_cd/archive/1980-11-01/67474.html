                <p>      <em>The smoking stars gather against it . . . the one who      cares for flowers is leaving us.</em>(from an Aztec song)    </p>        <p>      <em>Most regular readers of this publication</em>      <em>already know Alan Chadwick as the founder of the      biodynamic/French intensive school oil horticulture. Many,      no doubt, can even name a few of the sites - the      University of California at Santa Cruz, the Green Gulch      retreat, Virginia's Carmel in the Valley, and others      - whose soil has experienced his magic. It's strange,      then, that few people know much about Alan's background. .      . about the influences and forces that fed this exceptional      man to develop what could well be the most truly wholistic      gardening method in existence.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So, since MOTHER has visited with Alan many times in      the past, we'd like to present - by way of tribute      - a brief biography of this extraordinary man . . .      in both our words and his own.</em>    </p>    <p>      Alan Chadwick was born <em>-</em> on July 27, 1909      <em>-</em> into the "upper crust" of Edwardian      England's society. The family estate was enormous and      dotted with formal gardens of varying themes and sizes.      However, although the early exposure to such careful      horticulture certainly, <em>inspired</em> Alan, his mother      was the major influence upon the young boy.    </p>        <p>      "She was extremely artistic," he told us, "and gave me      <em>-</em> at a terribly early age <em>-</em>      an interest in all forms of creativity . . . and      particularly in horticulture and the mystery that is the      garden."    </p>    <p>      Chadwick's mother was also responsible for introducing her      son to another strong influence . . . the mystic Austrian      philosopher, Rudolph Steiner, whose theories about the      interrelatedness of living things were later to contribute      to the development of Alan's own gardening methods. Steiner      was, however, regarded as an "utter crank" by most of his      peers, and Chadwick has explained that the attitude of      house guests toward his tutor ("Very often, at tea or      dinner, they would turn to me and say, with just the      <em>slightest</em> curl of the lip, 'Do you <em>really</em>      study with that man, then?' ") served to further isolate      the teenager who, from early youth, "never liked human      beings . . . always got on with them in the worst way''.    </p>    <p>      But, though Alan had very little use for social      interaction, his incredible energies led him to excel in      any number of pursuits. The young man was to became a gold      medal skier and skater, a professional painter and      violinist, and a Shakespearean actor (a career which he      followed for 32 years) ... studying gardening all the      while. (It was, in Chadwick's own words, "the one means of      resuscitation, where the energy for my other activities was      generated".)    </p>    <p>      <em>All</em> of the man's pleasures, however, were brought      to an abrupt halt by the beginning of the Second World War.      It would be difficult to imagine anyone more poorly suited      to military life than this artist/gardener. However,      Britain <em>-</em> during World War II      <em>-</em> demanded that many people ignore their      true natures. As Alan explained it, "I'd <em>been</em> an      objector, but I was soon running a mine sweeper ... somehow      I was made a commander and spent four years on the bridge."    </p>    <p>      The war experience was a shattering one: "It absolutely      capsized my attitude to civilization. I had nothing left      that I could play, no cards left to play with humanity."      And in order to get out of his native land, which was the      focal point of the memories that haunted him, Alan accepted      an offer to act in <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> . . .      in a South African theater.    </p>    <p>      While there, Chadwick <em>-</em> who had already      achieved the "huge marriage between vision and      practicality" that was his synthesis of the biodynamic      teachings of Steiner and the incredibly productive      intensive gardening techniques that he'd studied in France      <em>-</em> designed a 26-acre national display      garden.    </p>    <p>      Still, though he was able to find joy on the stage and      peace among his carefully tended raised planting beds,      Alan's dislike for humanity caused him more and more to      shut himself off from others. And he might well have      remained that way, might well have gone through life      without sharing his great gift, had he not met Countess      Freya von Moltke . . . the widow of the famous German      general, Helmuth von Moltke.    </p>    <p>      This amazing woman, who had recently endured the death of      her husband <em>and</em> the defeat of her country, had      maintained a great love for humanity despite the burden of      her personal sorrows.    </p>    <p>      The two became dear friends ("she provided me with a      <em>balance</em> point"), and years later it was Freya who      arranged that Chadwick be offered a position with the      University of Santa Cruz . . . and <em>then</em> convinced      the still-reluctant gardener to accept the job, as well as      the challenge of spreading his method that it presented.    </p>    <p>      I t's interesting to note that <em>-</em> although      some hundreds of students have learned facets of the      biodynamic/French intensive method while working directly      with Chadwick, and literally <em>thousands</em> of men and      women have had their whole conception of horticulture      shifted 180Â° as a result of his work <em>-</em>      Alan always denied (and sometimes did so emphatically) that      he was a teacher. In speaking of the influence he had upon      others, he chose to offer a <em>different</em>      interpretation:    </p>    <p>      "The reason for all of it is simply that I love beauty . .      . I adore beauty and I absolutely <em>detest</em> ugliness.      There is also a factor beyond that, though. I've been very      selfish for much of my life, you see. I have lived for      nothing but art, I have <em>lived</em> for beauty.      <em>I</em> have. And I haven't <em>wanted</em> to teach      anyone anything . . . but the garden - and you must      realize that I almost never speak of any <em>one</em>      garden but of the <em>concept</em> itself - allowed      me to see a way not to be a tutor but, instead, to      <em>expose</em> a teaching.    </p>    <p>      "And I've found that the students, children and adults, who      work with me can come to understand in that way. Instead of      my telling them to do this and that <em>-</em>      instead of my forcing them to learn names and procedures      <em>-</em> I've been sometimes able to help them      discover secrets. And the garden is <em>all</em> secrets,      the whole miracle of the garden is made up of secrets, and      I've been granted the chance to expose a few others to this      incredible 'thing' which, <em>itself</em> , is the teacher.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      Alan Chadwick passed away on May 25, 1980. On the wall to      the left of his bed he had hung - just prior to his      death - a copy of Shakespeare's Sonnet XV. It is as      fitting a summary of the man's file as anyone could ask      for.      <p>        <em>When I consider every thing that grows<br />        Holds in perfection but a little moment,<br />        That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br />        Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<br />        When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br />        Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,<br />        Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br />        And wear their brave state out of memory;<br />        Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<br /></em>        <em>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br />        Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,<br />        To change your day of youth to sullied night;<br />        And all in war with Time for love of you,<br />        As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</em>      </p>    </div>    <p>      "It is, you see <em>-</em> though many people seem to      find the idea amusing <em>-</em> the garden that      makes the gardener."    </p>
