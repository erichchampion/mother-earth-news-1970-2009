                    <p>      <strong>In Pursuit of the Good Life:<br />      Finding that Perfect Country Place<br />      by John Vivian</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Here is what Real Estate ads don't tell you, trendy      books don't feature and what brokers don't want you to      know.</strong>    </p>           <p>      For most of us, a move to the country means declaring our      freedom from an office or a plant or lifelong local roots.      But freedom has a cost. Do you worry that sixfigure real      estate prices, high property taxes, and rising bank      interest rates will just have you swapping the urban rat      race for a country-mouse version of the "Good Life"? Let's      see if I can't convince you that the major purchase in your      life - a home and a little land - needn't be      nearly so expensive and constraining as . . . what is the      going price for a home and lot today in one of the "prime"      areas ... $140,000 or something equally rid iculous. To get      control of your own life, all you need do is throw off the      view that all the nice people live in a city or suburb,      surrounded by automated appliances, new cars, and debt.    </p>    			    <p>      Begging for the moment the cheapest and most rewarding way      to establish a homeplace (building it yourself on $400/acre      "unimproved" land), the property descriptions you see above      include not one word of fiction, but are taken from ads      clipped from country periodicals and rural real estate      flyers from the eastern and midwestern parts of the country      I know personally over the past year or so (1995-'96).    </p>    <p>      These places aren't hovels either ... or lost and forgotten      in some backwater. Backwater hovels don't get advertised.      The homes are all solidly-built, livable, and located in or      near fine little country communities. You can buy most of      these places (if you can't avoid taking a conventional      mortgage) for from $250/month to perhaps twice that. With      one or another system of "creative-financing" you can      usually tailor payments to your income. I'll get to that in      a moment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A 150-acre-plus farm for $400/acre?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Let's go a little deeper into that first ad. You might be      tempted to think what far too many people already believe,      that decent farm land costs $2,500/acre minimum, right? So      how can you get that fine old Wisconsin (cheese-country)      dairy farm for less than $400/acre? Well, the land has      probably been in hay for two years.... I'd guess that a      farmer retired, had no heir to keep the farm going, so he      sold the herd and equipment and put the land and buildings      on the block. Asking price is $67,000. Offer 40 and pay 54.    </p>    <p>      I wouldn't encourage you to take up dairy farming from      scratch, but you could commute to a good day job in Eau      Claire, rent a neighbor's equipment to plant and harvest a      typical 50 bu/acre small-grain crop. In one good or two      mediocre years the land will buy itself with cash left to      buy next year's seed. Or, leave the land in hay, shift it      gradually to alfalfa and clover, and start a grass-fed,      organic beef herd. Or, if convenient to a good highway to      town, plant a pick-your-own strawberry operation. Or plant      a modern apple orchard; dwarf apple trees will produce more      than the same acreage of standard trees and they don't take      a generation to mature. No ladders are needed for harvest      either, so you and your family, or a small crew of local      high school students can start picking in two or three      years. You'll have the land paid for by the fourth or fifth      year and, with a 150 acres planted to orchard as you can      afford time and planting stock, you can be financially      independent for the rest of your life in six to ten years.      I am not kidding! (More about "retirement-income      orcharding" in the next issue.)    </p>    <p>      The ad from Maine may raise an eyebrow as well. Everybody      knows that state-of-Maine coastal property goes for      thousands of dollars a waterfront-foot, right? Mebbe for      that stretch of stormlashed "Downeast" pink granite that      some movie actor bought for a Hollywood price, or down on      the sand coast an hour's drive from Boston and in walking      distance of George & Barbara Bush's place. But the log      cabin on a high bluff in an "undiscovered" area of Maine      cited above would cost you less than $100/ft. Chain a      flotilla of pinelogs in the deepwater bay out front, use a      new state-funded program to start raising gourmet kelp for      the Japanese and domestic sushi markets, and pay for your      oceanside retreat in short order with seaweed that's free      for the picking. Begin to look at each ad differently and      start dreaming better.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lower-Cost Housing</strong>    </p>    <p>      MOTHER regularly features articles on earth-berm, hay-bale,      earthship, and many other forms of hand-made homes. Here      are some other low-cash-outlay options to consider.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mobile homes</em>    </p>    <p>      The under-$5,000 mobile home listed above is an estate sale      of an old but solid trailer in one of the many      50-year-or-older south Florida parks, so thick with palms,      citrus trees, and flowering tropical vegetation you can      barely see the homes - all on termite-proof concrete      foundations with terazzo-floored glass/screen "Florida      rooms," car ports, and wall-to-wall air conditioning. Many      of them are better built than a brand new, $85,000      counterpart. In Florida, mobile prices seldom fall under      the teens, but low-price ads like this one appear in      northern newspaper classifieds from time to time when heirs      to their late grandmother's retirement retreat don't have      the time to manage and pay lot-rent and utilities for a      place that's a continent's length away.    </p>    <p>      Start with getting photos of the inside, outside, and the      park surroundings. A phone call to neighbors can alert you      to problems and teach you something about the local social      life, stores, pubic transportation, and other small but      important details. Next, call the local Realty Board for      the name of a nearby realtor/appraiser and spend a little      for independent value and structural appraisals. The Better      Business Bureau can let you know if the park operator has a      bad reputation.    </p>    <p>      <em>Fix-ups</em>    </p>    <p>      When the back-to-the-land movement began in the '60s, we      all yearned for an old New England farmstead we could      restore as we lived the life. Many who stuck with it and      did the restoration right benefited from the inflation of      the '70s and '80s and parlayed a four- or five-figure      investment into a place that would be advertised now as      "Pristine c. 1790 Restored Colonial with 4 working      fireplaces plus beehive oven on 5 acres with post &      beam barn, brook and pond ... only $399,900." Run-down New      England Colonials are hard to find, cost a bundle ... and      the RE-inflation boom is over for our generation.    </p>    <p>      To parlay a small initial investment into a family home      (say nothing of a six-figure fortune) these days, many of      us will need to emulate the way the original homesteaders      built those rambling Colonials ... by adding on in      increments as prosperity and family increased. And -      as modern homesteader Scott Nearing advises - they      "paid as they went," building with their own labor, buying      what materials they couldn't supply themselves with saved      cash ... and avoiding that single greatest obstacle to      independence: a long-term mortgage.    </p>    <p>      With few of us able to afford huge Colonial families, hired      hands, or take up farming for a living - and few of      us willing to wait generations to realize our dream -      the incremental approach to homestead-building takes forms      unknown in the Colonial days.    </p>        <p>      <em>Camps</em>    </p>    <p>      MOTHER has published plans for minihomes, and by all means,      consider building a small place from scratch and adding on      as time and cash permit. But a trend that hasn't been      picked up by the national press to my knowledge is the      upgrading and winterization of ready-made small homes:      hunting and lake-side vacation cabins - collectively      called "camps" in the North East. "Camps" range from tiny      tar paper ice-fishing shacks to the log mansions built in      the Adirondacks by the Vanderbilts, Jay Gould, and Will      Durant back in the Golden Age.    </p>    <p>      Most reasonably-sized camps hark back to the 1920s or      earlier, and come with a few acres of land sectioned out of      what was thought to be worthless woods after it was logged      off. Most structures are of basic wood-frame construction,      uninsulated, with summer-only water systems. Many are      half-abandoned. Tin roofs are common. Many I've seen sell      in the low five-figures, and most have been fully paid-for      for fifty years or more and owners are often happy to take      a note or a private mortgage for a year or two.    </p>    <p>      Their big advantage over new construction is that in most      places the building is "grandfathered" - meaning that      it can be lived in as is indefinitely (at least for      "seasonal" occupancy). So often-restrictive building codes      don't apply until you make major changes, which must then      meet the code. You can use the old wood-burning camp stove      and outhouse while you work on the place, install a      code-acceptable septic system, rebuild foundations or add      rooms as needed. I can show you a dozen lovely small homes      salvaged from what was little more than a shack - on      a cash-as-available basis - by young marrieds or      almost-retired couples. "Sweat-equity" at work.    </p>    <p>      But, be sure the local Code doesn't contain a "sleeper"      clause requiring that if one major alteration is made      - say, a new roof - the whole place (frame,      doors and windows, septic, water, etc.) must be brought up      to code before an occupancy permit will be issued.    </p>        <p>      <em>Partly-developed land</em>    </p>    <p>      The countryside everywhere is sprinkled with false starts      where folks only partially realized their own country      dream. The landscape is dotted with plots of land with only      a foundation in ... or a driveway and utilities ... or just      a septic system installed. I can show you a half-dozen      house shells: log cabins, modern solar homes, conventional      frame dwellings that were framed and roofed but are empty      inside. Many still carry a mortgage, and if the bank likes      your credit history and prospects, they'll happily let you      assume mortgage payments - in effect, getting the      former owners downpayment and much of what has been built      for nothing.    </p>        <p>      This technique - taking over a mortgage from some      unfortunate soul who's lost a job or otherwise can't keep      up payments - is all there is to those      "Make-a-million in Real Estate" courses you see advertised      on TV in the wee hours. So avoid the course, read on, and      save another $300.    </p>    <p>      Look in the country-paper RE ads for the terms "possible      owner-financing" or "assume Mtg. pmts." and drive a hard      deal - especially if you have a strong credit rating,      a good income, and are dealing with a bank or a real estate      speculator. I know one such situation where a local S&L      bank had been stuck with an old place they'd foreclosed on      for over a year (banks hate being in the real estate      business). The price was gradually lowered from the high      twenties to $15,000. They finally sold it for $3,900, no      money down, and financed the full sum with a      no-added-collateral personal loan - same as a used      car.    </p>    <p>      One aside about those TV courses. As often as not, the poor      victim you end up buying from is another buyer of the TV      course who has over-extended himself. At its worst, the      technique suggested is dealing in slums - buying      rental properties and milking them - taking rent but      putting nothing back into the building. The TV ads promise      "an immediate cash income" after buying a property "no      money down." That's rent money, folks, usually from people      who have genuine difficulty getting it together each month.      Lots of luck getting it from them.    </p>    <p>      At best, however, by assuming a mortgage you can often get      a real bargain and free someone who has had hard luck from      a burden he'll be glad to relinquish.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOUR MUST HAVE MAPS</strong>    </p>    <p>      You will need a variety of maps to research a potential new      country home area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Roadmap.</strong> A national road map such as      Rand-McNally contains a wealth of information, and is a      bargain at under $10. Available at any newsstand.      Smaller-scale - thus more detailed - "Grand      Maps" are published by regional firms.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3D State Maps.</strong> The best way to visualize      the topography of a state at a glance is to get the Real      Goods catalog (555 Leslie St., Ukiah, CA 95482-5507,      707-468-9292) and order a Raven 3D map for $25 (available      only for Eastern and western states, as most of the      midwestern Great Plains is flat).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marine Chart.</strong> To prospect country near      navigable water, order marine charts that give details of      the waterway as well as inland for a mile or so from any of      the marine supply outlets that advertise in the boating      magazines. Be sure to get (free), "Chart #1" that tells you      how to interpret the maps.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Topos.</strong> Once you narrow down your locale      choices, get topographic maps of areas of interest.      Developed by U.S. Geological Survey (Dept. of      Transportation) these highly detailed color maps show      elevations, waterways, and natural features -      including every house, pond, barn, baseball field, and golf      course visible from the air or a mapping satellite.      Available folded for $2.50 apiece from government printing      offices (Pueblo, CO 80225 or Reston, VA 22092), but rolled      topos are obtainable a lot faster (and for a bit more      - $4.00 is typical) from your local sporting goods      store. Get a guide to reading the maps if you are a novice.      A topo will tell you more than you can learn by walking the      land.    </p>    <p>      <strong>First Comes the Land</strong>    </p>    <p>      To you and me, at least as important as structures is the      lay, look, and arability of the land. At first, we all      think we want big acreage - or at least want to own      "both sides of the road" - if only to protect against      having unwanted neighbors. The cheapest way to accomplish      this is to find a small parcel butting up against a state      or national park or other government-owned preserve or      against a major wetland of any ownership. Finding such      properties takes a lot of looking - much of it map      research (see "Four Must-Have Maps").    </p>    <p>      You may scope out an ideal piece of unimproved land that is      privately owned. If it is in an isolated location, or if      nearby farmers don't know the owner, go to the land office      (town office in municipalities) and find out who owns it.      Often, large tracts are owned by corporations, estates,      banks, or absentee landlords as an investment.    </p>    <p>      It may take some persuasion to work a deal, but raw land      can be cheap: a few hundred dollars an acre compared to      $1,000/acre and up (and UP) for typical country parcels      with road frontage in the East. Surveyed and subdivided, a      five-acre lot can cost $20,000 or more - a sum that      can get you 100 acres and more bought "raw."    </p>    <p>      You'll need a lawyer and may have to pay $2,500 and up for      a survey. But try to purchase a small parcel and buy a      "first refusal" on all the surrounding property. Then, for      a few hundred dollars, you have a legal right to buy      specified parcels of land (at market price) before it can      be sold to another buyer. In areas that are not undergoing      development, your little sale may be forgotten but for      documents on file. You could then enjoy an estate and pay      taxes on a house lot.    </p>    <p>      In other parts of the country, you may be able to lease a      plot for 99 years at a reasonable cost per acre. In 99      years (unless the lease is renegotiated) your heirs lose      any building you erect, so don't build a mansion. In the      Northeast, land-leasing is common around lakes and in      scenic mountain areas, and can be a bargain. Again, hire a      lawyer to assure having full vehicular access and building,      water, etc., rights.    </p>        <p>      Zoning in many populated areas requires that building lots      be a minimum size and have a minimum amount of road      frontage (or that an approved road be built in and <em>by      you</em> ). Be sure your lot satisfies the zoning laws      before you put a cent down.    </p>    <p>      Some areas ignore road frontage, and approve rights-of-way      to back-lots through abutting property. In lake country,      many properties not on the shore may have a deeded      right-of-way to the water. Logging or fire-access roads may      exist on paper only. I know of a luxury mountain-home      property where a logging-road ROW goes up the drive, under      the living room bay window, and on up the road and through      the middle of their new garage/barn. If the mountain is      ever logged off, they cannot stop the skidders and      timberjacks. Some ancient ROWS may not be in your deed      - but exist in someone else's. This can lead to      expensive litigation. Where land-ownership is concerned,      even low-cost back-country deals need to be expertly      lawyered.    </p>    <p>      In most populated areas, your land must pass a percolation      test (be able to absorb a given amount of water in a given      amount of time) before a septic system plan or permit is      approved. Be sure your land perks or you will not be able      to build without paying to haul in tons of gravel to make a      septic leach field. I know one couple that paid more for      their gravel bed (at $250/dumptruck load) than for their      land.    </p>    <p>      A "perk test" is not done by digging a hole with a shovel      and dumping in a bucket of water. By law, a backhoe digs a      pit and it is filled from a tanker. Then, an engineer has      to measure how fast the water level drops. I know of one      glorious mountain property (called "The Lookout" by us      locals) that has a spectacular view of ocean islands, a      stream with a waterfall, mature pines and all - but      is located on a ledge. The too-shallow soil is pockmarked      with unsuccessful perk-pits dug by a succession of      disappointed would-be purchasers lured by ads placed by the      latest owner. Will Smoot, the local excavating contractor      who has to haul his ($250/hr. point-to-point) tractor three      miles up the mountain to dig each set of pits, says:      "Selling off 'The Lookout' was the smartest thing that      granddad ever done. This is the second tractor its bought      and paid for and I don't see no end to it."    </p>    <p>      Some enlightened locales will award a residency permit on      unperkable land if you install approved composting or      gas-incinerator toilets and convince them that your "grey      water" - wash water - will go into the garden.      But get approval in writing before you buy. Again, you must      invest $200 to $1,000 - more for complex matters      - in the services of a locally-experienced RE lawyer.    </p>    <p>      The cheapest (and, often the most scenic) land is found in      the far boondocks. "Jeep roads" as labeled on topo maps are      boulder-strewn mud or sand tracks that can bog any wheeled      vehicle in shifting sand or spring and fall slop and be      unplowable in a snowy winter. If you have to build an      all-weather road for any distance, you are in for major      costs (a big bulldozer or road grader costs upwards of $800      an hour).    </p>    <p>      You can eschew roads and live a primitive life in remote      isolation if you like. I like, but only in good weather and      not for very long at a time. My own cabin in the woods      functions with an outhouse, hand-dug fresh rainwater      cistern, wood heat, and kerosene light and utilities. I've      not yet spent a whole winter mushing or boating in all my      supplies and doubt I ever will; I have work to do, and it      is a full-time job just to stay warm and reasonably      well-fed in winter when everything must be done by hand.      Plus, I'm no longer a kid. In total isolation, a strained      back can be a major problem, and a broken leg could be      fatal.    </p>    <p>      Providing even the most basic modern amenities to a distant      location is not easy. If you plan to live "on the grid"      - using commercial electric power and phone lines      - figure paying the electric utility $30,000 a mile      to set poles and string cable. That's not a mistake: thirty      thousand dollars a mile ... on flat land. If you go "off      the grid," you can buy a solar-electric, diesel-electric or      hybrid power plant and run it for a lifetime for that sum.    </p>    <p>      Cell phones do reach into some remote areas, and they      aren't exorbitant compared to stringing Ma Bell–style      lines. A top-grade marine-style private satellite phone      link costs $7,500 plus a hefty time-charge these days, but      that price is falling. Bone up on alternative power and      communications technology and save your pennies before      deciding to live off-grid. It is the ultimate in      self-reliance, but it may make that remote piece of land      less of a bargain than you'd bargained for.    </p>        <p>      <strong>The Search</strong>    </p>    <p>      Now to cut to the chase. How to find that property?    </p>    <p>      The climate maps seen on these pages will lay out the broad      temperature, rainfall and growing areas of the country. In      my experience, you'll do best staying close to the climatic      zone you were raised in. I know Yankees who just can't take      week after week of 90 degrees Fahrenheit, Texas humidity,      and find okra slimy and grits tasteless. Then there are the      Johnny-Rebs who gag at the mere thought of clam chowder,      think winter squash is bitter, and are miserable in six      months of Maine snow.    </p>    <p>      Consider carefully how near/far you should be from      relatives (yours or your spouse's - despite the tired      old mother-in-law jokes). "Being closer to grandchildren"      or "being able to see my mom more often" is the reason many      people in our Community Survey reported for disliking or      wanting to change locations.    </p>    <p>      Now, start collecting charts, maps, and other research      material (See sidebar The "Four-Must Have" Maps).    </p>    <p>      Your phone book has a number where you can order any phone      book in the land and have it billed to your own account.      Get the books for all areas you are interested in. The      Yellow Pages will give you a wealth of information about      business in the area. If your last name is Svensen and you      find three pages of Johansens, Johnsons, Jorgensens and      other Scandinavian names in the White Pages, you ought to      fit right in.    </p>    <p>      Find the address of the local newspaper and subscribe      - both to the weekend edition and the issue      containing the most real estate ads. Don't be shocked if      most country places you'll be looking at will only have a      weekly - and that if you're lucky. After a few weeks      of reading the paper you will not only know the area, but      have an idea of land and property availability.    </p>    <p>      If you have a computer with a CD-ROM drive, you should get      "Street Atlas U.S.A." for Mac or Windows by DeLorme      Mapping. They have made one-off copies of the      1:2,5000-scale Geological Survey maps of the entire      country, recolored it and put the entire nation on one      disc. You can locate (and print out in color if you like)      maps that show every highway, road, street, and named or      numbered goat path in the US. of A. Cost is about $50      through any mail order computer-goods catalog. The CD      offers more detail for towns and cities than for open      country, as elevation lines weren't taken off.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Computers and the Internet</strong>    </p>    <p>      Then again, you can call up sections of the DeLorme CD from      the Internet (but it is slow unless you have a super-fast      modem and computer). Which brings me to the best way to      prospect for real estate - on "the Net."    </p>    <p>      Upwards of 10,000 real estate brokers, large and small, are      advertising homes on "the Net." Cost is so low that every      real estate broker who takes the business half seriously      will have a "Home Page" on the Internet by 1997. You'll be      able to find (and print if you like) photos and specs of      <em>every property for sale in North America</em> -      and eventually the world - from the Internet.    </p>    <p>      If you really want to move to the country and have any use      at all for a data-processing device, there is no better      investment than a computer, high-speed modem and printer,      and a $20/month account on the Internet. If you don't want      to give in to the computer revolution or spend the $2,000      it takes, get an Internet account of your own to access      using the machines at your public Library. Or wait till      early 1997 and get one of the new Network Computers. These      hand-held electronic devices built primarily to surf the      Internet and display information on your TV set will sell      for about as much as a new Sega computer game. A single      protocol was agreed to by IBM, Apple, and all the major      industry firms but Microsoft. Oracle is leading the      consortium, making the major access software and exhibited      a prototype to the industry last spring that was made from      off-the-shelf components costing about $300.    </p>    <p>      OR you can spend a lot more than $500 in phone calls,      mailings, and pavement-pounding. See Sources for by-mail      information. However you do it, you'll end up dealing with      Real Estate Brokers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Brokers</strong>    </p>    <p>      Brokers make a business of connecting property buyers and      sellers, and work on commission - typically 6 to 8      percent of sale price for close-in-town properties, 10 to      12 percent for properties a long drive from the office.      Sellers pay the commission, so the broker works for them.      Not all states require that this fact be made known to the      buyer. Most brokers in good markets subscribe to the local      MLS (multiple-listing service) where all brokers list most      properties after they have tried to sell them as an      "exclusive" for a few weeks. The listing and selling      brokers split the commission 60/40, or another      locally-accepted formula.    </p>    <p>      A stylized "R" on a sign means that the broker at least has      signed a code of ethics, and real estate agents must pass a      state licensing exam. Neither of these hurdles,      unfortunately, guarantees that your broker is honest or      knows his or her business. A better indication is a local      firm that is affiliated with one of the big national      "chains" of independently-owned offices such as Century 21,      United Farm, Coldwell-Banker, and others. However, brokers      join the nationals in large part to have their listings      exposed to executives who move from city to city. As a      result, they tend to list the more expensive      "executive"-type homes.    </p>    <p>      Smaller, more rustic, less expensive rural properties are      often exclusive listings of small, strictly local brokers      - who may or may not be members of the regional      multiple-listing association. Anybody can get licensed to      do this kind of business, and many job-holders moonlight as      realtors after hours and on weekends when activity is      greatest. But I can honestly say that I have never dealt      with a country broker who failed to take me (first thing)      to the place I eventually purchased or leased (even if I      insisted on seeing a dozen others) ... at a more than fair      price ... and who did not later become a valued friend. You      can't miss them: they could stand to lose a few pounds,      wear really comfortable walking shoes, and look you      straight in the eye from the very start.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Creative Financing</strong>    </p>    <p>      In conventional real estate financing, you make out a      lengthy net-worth statement revealing everything you own or      owe, and sign a waiver giving a mortgage banker permission      to investigate your personal and financial history from      birth. Using your name, birth date, maiden name of your      mother and Social Security Number, they get your records      from semisecret regional credit-reporting firms to which      most lenders report every credit transaction each month. If      you've had a disagreement over a car loan or forgot to mail      the electric bill or missed a payment for more than a      month, they'll know it.    </p>    <p>      Assuming you pass, they then tell you how much you can      borrow. Formulas vary, but depend on income and "credit      worthiness" (to a banker, money is Life, loan-repayment is      phrased in high moral, ecclesiastical terms). Banks      generally expect you to put 20 percent of the sale price      "down" - so you have your own cash in the deal and      will be disinclined to risk losing it by defaulting on the      loan.    </p>    <p>      Then, they reduce your monthly income by state and federal      income taxes, alimony and child support, car payments,      credit card payments, and insurance on the house you want      to buy. If there's anything left, they take about half of      that and figure you can use it to buy a house. (Or they      will let you assume a mortgage cost that is between 28 and      36 percent of monthly "gross income" - your paycheck      less taxes, union dues and repayment of bad debts, IRS      liens, and other financial sins against Mammon.)    </p>    <p>      You can get a mortgage-calculator on the Internet, in      Personal Finance computer programs and in many books, but      here is a basic one:    </p>        <p>      So, say you have $500/month left for the mortgage-payment,      and interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is 7.5 percent      this week, a bank would let you borrow $71,500 to buy a      homeplace (500 divided by 6.99). Grossed up by your 20      percent down, that will get you a place selling for      $86,000.    </p>    <p>      That won't get you much in San Francisco (highest-priced RE      market in the U.S. in the latest survey by the National      Association of Homebuilders - data for last quarter      of '95). But, in the NAH's lowest-priced market, Lima,      Ohio, $86,000 would get you a brand-new four-bedroom family      home in the latest cornfield being consumed by a housing      development. (By coincidence or not, Lima is in one of      MOTHER'S "Top Ten" areas to live the Good Life as revealed      in our Community Survey. Still, it is debatable which is a      better contribution to the economy by an acre of prime Ohio      farmland: production of 50 bushels of grain per year      forever or the combination of some land speculator's 1,000      percent profit, sales of a house-load California      Fir-lumber, a month or two of local construction jobs, and      decades of future property taxes that combine in a new      split-level dream home.)    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>The Penalties of Voluntary Simplicity</strong>    </p>    <p>      However, if you reduce your income needs sufficiently to      escape the system, you may not meet a bank's income      requirements. Or the run-down, sagebrush-choked sheep ranch      in New Mexico may not qualify in their steely eye. Or, you      may want to pay for the place over the two-and-a-half years      you plan to continue scrimping as you labor in your town so      as to be mortgage-free when you Make The Move to the      country.    </p>    <p>      Here is where creative financing comes in. The books can      give you details. But do your best to have the property      owner take a note for whatever you can't pay up front      - for the shortest repayment period you can handle by      practicing frugality and diverting money from that new car,      those restaurant meals, and the vacation to Acapulco into      the new place. That's called Owner Financing and owners of      unusual or hard-to-sell properties become more amenable to      the idea the longer the place is on the market.    </p>    <p>      You might do a Bridge-Loan, where you hold onto your      current home till you get a good purchase-offer (maybe      renting it in the interim if the rental-housing market is      tight). Cook a bridge-mortgage to cover both properties      while the old place is on the market.    </p>    <p>      Another option is Lease-to-buy or Rent-to-buy where you      don't need a cent of down money, but apply part of a rental      or lease payment toward purchase.    </p>    <p>      Realtors these days can come up with all sorts of crafty      formulas to move a property - such as "Balloon      Payments," where you pay small amounts for a certain time,      then deliver the balance in a lump sum... say, when our      original home sells, or when you get paid for that first      giant order of baby cactus from Japan. Especially if      there's no bank involved, be sure you have a good lawyer      working for you.    </p>    <p>      DO NOT let yourself get suckered by a Finance Company.      These sharks advertise in all the real estate media and      you'd think they are giving mortgage money away to      "No-Credit, Bad-Credit, Divorces, Bankruptcies, Payoffs."      Not being a chartered lending institution, they are not      licensed or regulated by federal or state banking agencies.      They answer (if at all) only to consumer-protection      regulations - and can charge any rate a credit card      is permitted in your state (and, they can add on any "Fees"      they like-to effectively raise rates higher still).    </p>    <p>      Finance Company offices are invariably headquartered      outside your state, making governmental oversight or      regulation of their practices even harder. Few of them      retain the same business name or charter very long, so can      be impossible to trace. Checking on the principal's      business history is equally difficult. Plus, if stiffed,      their collection techniques can be right out of The      Godfather. Guess why.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INFORMATION SOURCES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Following is a list of telephone and on-line numbers, mail      and Internet addresses, TV programs, books and magazines      where you can find information on locating, evaluating, and      buying country real estate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Locating an Out-of-Town Broker</strong>    </p>    <p>      Real estate brokers can be expert in only a very limited      geographic area, so have welcomed "information-age"      technologies that connect them with allied brokers all      across the continent.
