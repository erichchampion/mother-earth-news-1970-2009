                <p>      <strong>GARDEN & YARD</strong>    </p>        <p><strong>Never break your back turning compost      again.</strong>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">By David Mukamal Camp</h5>        <p>      <em>I work so hard in the garden that I don't want to work      hard making compost as well. I'm sure you've seen the      traditional composter design with three separate bins.      You're supposed to use a fork to turn the compost regularly      from one bin into another to aerate it. My alternative bin      design takes up less space in the garden and eliminates      that little bit of labor, so you can throw your back out      doing something more fun, like weeding.</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Breaking It Down</strong>    </p>    <p>      The key to leaving your compost in one place is to get air      to the center of the pile. I use 2" ABS pipe that I drilled      full of holes. The sides of this bin have a 2 1/2" channel      for the pipe ends to ride in, leaving them open to draw in      air. I lined the channels with 1/2" hardware cloth, folded      to fit and stapled to the inside of the sides.    </p>    <p>      Most of the dimensions in this project are not critical; in      fact, you should build it according to the lumber you have      on hand. I had some rough redwood fence boards and a few      extra 2 x 4 studs; I cut the frame pegs from an old broom      handle. Redwood or cedar are the best choices for this      project because they're the most rot-resistant. I won't kid      you though; you're making a box to hold decomposing      vegetable matter and wet dirt. Expect to replace it in 10      or 12 years, no matter what kind of wood you use.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cutting It Up</strong>    </p>    <p>      Start by cutting all 16 side planks to the same length      - about 40". You're going to make two A sides and two      B sides as shown in the illustration. The basic difference      is that the battens on the B side have to extend past the      planks of the A side. You'll also notice that the rabbets      on the ends of the battens are oriented so they fit      together to form a half lap joint.    </p>    <p>      Measure the width of four side planks lying side by side;      then add 6" to figure the length of your A side battens (2      1/2" for the channel, plus 1/4" between planks, plus 1 1/2"      rabbets at each end). Cut four 2 x 4s to the A length and      four that are 2" longer for the B side battens; then rip      them all into 2 x 2s (actual size 1 1/2" x 1 1/2") so you      end up with eight of each.    </p>    <p>      The next step is to cut the 1 1/2" wide by 3/4" deep      rabbets on the ends of the battens. I used dado blades on      my radial arm saw and damped a stop block to the fence to      make them all the same. Now mark the centers of each rabbet      for the holes that fit over the pins.    </p>    <p>      Pull out four battens of each length to use as the top and      bottom frame members. Drill 5/8" holes in the ends for the      pins. Drill 3/4" holes in the other eight battens. Cut 4"      long pins from a broomstick or a 5/8" dowel and round over      the ends.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Putting It Together</strong>    </p>    <p>      To assemble the frames, use Elmer's outdoor wood glue in      the rabbets of two A battens and two B battens and all over      the bottom half of the pins. Drive the pins in place and      check the assembly for square by measuring corner to      corner. If the measurements between diagonals are the same,      it's square. I further reinforced this joint by driving a 1      3/4" screw into the pin at an angle that captures all three      pieces.    </p>    <p>      Now assemble the A sides by laying two of the shorter      battens on the floor with their rabbets facing the same      direction. Lay one side board across the end of the      battens, aligning it with the shoulder of the rabbet. Use a      framing square to help you position the battens 1 1/2" from      the ends of the board and also perpendicular to it.    </p>    <p>      Attach the board to the battens with 2" deck screws. Lay      another board at the opposite end of the battens and repeat      this procedure. Now position the two middle planks and      screw them to the battens.    </p>    <p>      To assemble the B sides you go through the same procedure,      except this time position the two outer planks 1" back from      the shoulder of the rabbets. After attaching the hardware      cloth to the channels, you're ready to set this thing up.    </p>    <p>      Lay one frame on the ground with the pins up. Set the two B      sides in place with their rabbets up; then position the A      sides with their rabbets down. The planks fit down inside      the frame. Capture the sides with the top frame, fitting      its pins down into the batten holes.    </p>        <p>      Measure the distance between the channels of opposite sides      and cut the air pipes just a bit short so they don't get      hung up on the hardware cloth. You're going to need two      different lengths. I was only able to buy ABS pipe in 20'      lengths; you'll need about 30' worth of air pipes. Cut an      equal number of both lengths for your compost bin, and then      drill 'em full of holes. If you have a drill press it goes      pretty fast. Cut the leftover pipe into 16" to 18" lengths      and use them as watering tubes next time you plant trees.    </p>    <p>      The last step is to cut a square of carpet scrap (easily      retrieved from an installer's dumpster) to fit down inside      the bin. This will keep the smell down and help retain      moisture.    </p>    <p>      <strong>My Basic Compost Recipe</strong>    </p>    <p>      Throw in kitchen scraps; yard trimmings; manure from      rabbits, chickens, and horses (but none from meat eaters      such as dogs and cats); wood shavings, sawdust, and ashes      from your woodstove. Every couple of inches or so, lay one      of the air pipes across the pile and then throw on a layer      of dirt. Water your compost whenever you think of it      - but certainly whenever you rinse out the kitchen      scrap bucket.    </p>
