            		<p><strong>Country Lore</strong></p>            <p>      <strong>See your way clear to the morning paper.</strong>    </p>    <p>      How many times do you go out to see if your newspaper has      been delivered? I go out, unlock the gate, fight to keep      the dogs in the yard (we have four), get out to the holder      - and nothing.    </p>    <p>      After about three trips, I get upset. So I decided to build      a newspaper holder to eliminate stress.    </p>    <p>      Wanting to maintain my nickname, Cheap-o-Bob, I went over      to my garage (my wife calls it a firetrap) to see what I      had on hand. I found a pieceof old six-inch PVC water main, a piece of 			Plexiglas, and a roll of plumber's strap.    </p>        <p>      I cut the PVC pipe 16 to 18 inches long. Then I cut a      circle out of the Plexiglas to fit over the end ofthe PVC      pipe and cemented it on with PVC cement or silicon rubber.      I mounted the pipe on a board with two plumber's straps and      drilled a hole in the bottom of the closed end to let rain      out.    </p>    <p>      From my living room window, I can look right through the      holder to see my paper. For larger Sunday papers, use      eight-inch PVC pipe.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Bob Jackson<br />      Golden Valley, AZ</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Recycling Is Reusing</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here are some of my favorite tips:    </p>    <p>      Use old panty hose when you move. They are great for      keeping the leaves from banging on tables, keeping drawers      in dressers, and anchoring items in a truck. Don't throw      out your windshield wiper blades. Use a sharp knife or      razor blade to cut off the cracked and dry portions. But be      careful not to cut off too much of the blade, or the metal      guard behind the rubber may scratch your windshield if the      blades get too thin. Recycle your used greeting cards. Glue      the pages together and use them whole or cut out your      favorite designs. Punch a hole in them, add ribbon, and use      them as gift tags for packages.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jessica Cramer<br />      Green Bay, WI</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kitties in the Bush</strong>    </p>    <p>      Re: "Cat Litter Can" ["Country Lore," March 1996]. Indeed      there are many uses for cat litter, but you should be very      careful where you use litter. I put cat litter on my steps      during a snowstorm for traction and later swept it into the      bushes. Unfortunately, it drew cats to my house to try out      the new neighborhood...facilities.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Rita O' Sullivan</em><br />      <em>Midlothian, VA</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Old-Fashioned Baby Powder</strong>    </p>    <p>      When my daughter    </p>        <p>      Jessica suffered from diaper rash, I tried several      over-the-counter and prescription medications but none of      them seemed to help.    </p>    <p>      One day I left Jessica with an older woman who had raised      three daughters. I told her about Jessica's rash and the      pharmacy ointment I was using to treat it.    </p>    <p>      While I was gone, she "cooked up" her own diaper rash      remedy. By the time I returned, the mystery powder was      already healing the tender area. What was it? White flour      browned slowly in a skillet!    </p>    <p>      <em>- Karen Ann Bland<br />      Gove, KS</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Homemade Oil Tank</strong>      <strong>Detergent</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's how to clean oil out of an old tank.    </p>    <p>      First, paint the tank black and put it in the sun with the      drain hole at the lowest point (over a container, of      course). The solar heat will thin the oil and in a few days      most will be out. Then put in about 100 pounds of gravel, a      pint of Dawn dishwashing detergent, and five or ten gallons      of water.    </p>    <p>      For the next few weeks, roll it all over the place for      exercise. (My kids learned to walk on our 500-gallon tank.)      Then, drain the container. Wiggle it around and get all the      gravel out. Hoist it in the pickup and take to the nearest      coin-op car wash. Soap, then rinse, getting the wand      everywhere you can. (Removing any extra plugs in the tank      helps.) Take home, fill, and drain till you're bored with      it. Fill one more time and use the water on a few test      plants. If it doesn't hurt them, then you're probably OK.      If there's damage, start over at the gravel stage.    </p>    <p>      There is no way to do this without some release of      petroleum into the environment. Good stewardship requires      you to keep it to any amount less than the pollution caused      by the manufacture, delivery, and acquisition of a new      tank.    </p>    <p>      <em>-John Walker<br />      Otley, IA</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sunlite Solar Cones</strong>    </p>    <p>      About five years ago I came up with the idea of building my      own solar cones. These cones allow the gardener to start      plants earlier in the spring. They are not very hard to      build and cost very little.    </p>    <p>      The material I used to construct the 35-inch cone is three      feet wide and .04 inches thick. It is called Sunlite [see      the February/ March 1995 issue for more Sunlite solar cone      designs] and is a brand of fiberglass-reinforced plastic      sheeting available at most hardware stores.    </p>        <p>      You can build cones in different sizes from different      widths of fiberglass. Staggering cone patterns on a sheet      of Sunlite wastes the least material. I start by making a      paper pattern [see design]. I draw the cone on the      fiberglass sheet with a marking pen. Cut it out, using a      saber saw, drill the holes, and file the edges smooth with      sandpaper. This cone will then become the pattern for      subsequent cones.    </p>    <p>      Once you have the Sunlite cut out, pre-drill the holes for      fastening the cones so that when the cone edges are      overlapped, the holes align.    </p>    <p>      To assemble, start with the holes at the base of the cone,      and slowly squeeze the cone sides together, aligning and      fastening each hole on the way up. Use caution on the last      hole so as not to crack or craze the edges of the top      opening. I have used two different types of fasteners:      3/8-inch long nylon machine screws with hexagonal nuts, and      aluminum pop rivets with washers. Both work equally well.    </p>    <p>      <em>- William Shepherd<br />      Cambridge, OH</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Send your tips to "Country Lore," <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>,      P.O.
