                    <p>      <strong>Thirty-five years of car know-how. . . under the      hood.</strong></p>			<h5 id="byline">By Jon Gail Blair</h5>        <p>      <em>No matter what the guys in the garage business tell you      about spending years in less than ideal working conditions,      and</em> <em>almost always being underpaid for the      increasingly technical nature of what they perform for the      public, some of us just love what we do for a living.      Many</em> <em>years ago, l had to make the fateful decision      between wearing a shirt and tie every day for the rest of      my</em> <em>life and doing what I really loved. With every      passing day I am more grateful for choosing the garage.      Every day is different from the day before, and poses      an</em> entirely new set of challenges. <em>I don't have a      million bucks, but I've enjoyed (almost) every day of my      career for nearly 30 years. Name ten tie wearers who can      say the same.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>My Ford Escort four cylinder with fuel injection      plugged a fuel filter and even though I managed to replace      it, the engine still wouldn't start. I eventually had a      garage tow it in and the mechanics had it running in less      than an hour. What did</em> <em>I</em> <em>miss and how did      they</em> <em>fix</em> <em>it in such a hurry?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Ken Edelsman</strong><br />      Fort Wayne, IN</em>    </p>    <p>      Dig out your owner's manual and you will find reference to      a "Reset Button" somewhere, probably in the "engine      maintenance" section. This "Reset Button" is very much like      any circuit breaker in your house, and is intended to trip      off the fuel pump if there is a problem with the system.      Because your fuel pump will continue to pump fuel even to a      plugged filter, it has to be protected from itself, and you      need to be protected from a potentially dangerous      situation. For some cars without this provision, it is      often necessary to buy a new electric fuel pump (which      costs a good 300 bucks) even if the original problem is      nothing more complicated than a fuel filter plugged with      dirt and water. You will find the reset under the plastic      panel on the left when the deck lid is lifted. If yours is      like most I've seen, you will likely need a screwdriver to      remove the plastic guard before you can press the button      with your finger.    </p>    <p>      By the way, replacing a fuel filter underneath a car can      get you in over your head in a hurry, so don't try it      without all the proper tools and jacks. Line wrenches are a      must, and be sure there are no ignition sources anywhere      around that might ignite the inevitable small spills that      happen during the filter replacement process. I recommend a      yearly replacement of these critical fuel filters, which      might be more often than your maintenance schedule      suggests. Do it anyway. Some "dry gas" added to a fresh      tank each month will also help get the most from your      system. It will keep water from building up in the fuel      supply, and one can will neutralize about a teaspoon of      water. As a kid I once saw a gent coast down a hill in his      stalled car to a copse by the roadside, run in to get a jug      of the local "dry gas" hidden inside a hollow old tree,      pour it into his gas tank and take off down the road again      with the car running fine. From what I heard, that was a      common use of bad "moonshine." It gives me chills just to      think about anyone drinking it.    </p>    <p>      <em>As a present for her seventeenth birthday, 1 gave my      daughter our '89 Chevy Caprice. She loves it, but 1 feel a      bit nervous about her driving it far from home when she      knows so little about engines and maintenance. How would      you suggest giving her a crash course?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Peter Logan</strong><br />      Olympia, WA</em>    </p>    <p>      Well, that's a good one! I married a farm girl who could      drive the family tractors at 12 but still doesn't check the      oil on our cars after being married to a technician for 35      years. So let's begin there. You can certainly show her how      to check the engine oil level on the dipstick, which is      best done in the morning when the engine hasn't been      running all night. Next show her where the power steering      oil reservoir is and how to check that, and then go to the      transmission oil, stressing that the transmission is always      checked with the engine running. Tell her how to recognize      air filter, fan belt, and hose wear and to eyeball the      engine for these problems every week. Change a tire with      her twice, doing it first with her watching and then again      with you watching. Make sure that she has both a breaker      bar and a deep well socket in the trunk for such occasions,      and show her how to stand on the breaker bar to break the      lugnuts loose. The first time she comes home to brag about      how she changed a tire on a girlfriend's car while they      were away, you will know your own success. Make sure that      you have the state registration and insurance card (in a      zip lock bag) in the glove compartment along with the phone      number of the local AAA agency,    </p>        <p>      your membership number, and finally the phone number of an      approved AAA towing service. The last thing you want is her      stranded in the middle of nowhere, cold-calling "Joe's      $10,000 Per Axle Towing Service" if a hose is punctured or      a belt breaks and falls off.    </p>    <p>      Auto parts stores have or can get packages for a few bucks      that contain jumper cables, a reliable flashlight, a set of      signs which include one that says "Help," "Call the Police"      and several other necessary items for stranded motorists.      But be sure <em>you know</em> how to use a set of jumper      cables before you try to teach her. I would also recommend      that she keep an extra set of all belts the car might need,      (a dealership parts salesman will hook you up with the      right set). We carry fire extinguishers, as well, in all      our cars in my family. A ten pound fire extinguisher will      fit nicely out of sight, and if it doesn't, next time buy a      bigger car. There can be no frustration like that of      standing by helplessly while a fire ignites in your car      that you are helpless to address.    </p>    <p>      Now she's ready for the road.    </p>    <p>      <em>A few weeks ago, 1 had a garage put new tierod ends on      my Buick and no more than a week later, one fell</em>      <em>off</em> <em>on one side, causing a minor accident. My      insurance paid but I'm still disturbed by this. How can      this happen?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Dolores Fenik<br /></strong> Augusta, GA</em>    </p>    <p>      Actually millions of tons of fake replacement parts are      shipped into this country every year by "junk makers" all      over the world. Simply stated, junk makers do not have to      meet international standards to export junk, and the parts      have found their way into virtually every shop in the      country. I acquired a handful of junk nuts and bolts myself      at an auction, so even a relatively trained eye can get      tricked. One of the worst problems we have in our business      is junk sheet metal. We are habitually checking if the      replacement parts were actually approved by the car maker,      or if at least they were made in this country by a      reputable company. We try to watch as we assemble your car      on our racks but some unmarked nuts and bolts are going to      get through. It is a continuing problem especially where      the guy doing the work doesn't buy the nuts and bolts      himself. But please don't make the technician into a      scapegoat. Most state inspection agencies have already made      him a permanent scapegoat without your help.    </p>    <p>      The problem ultimately lies at Congress's doorstep. Making      manufacturing specifications a necessity and not just a      suggestion will mean a lot less tierod ends falling off.    </p>    <p>      <em>I found the spare in my 1988 Chevy flat when I needed      it but when I took it in to be repaired, nobody would fix      it for me. I tried three different tire shops and all      refused, saying they were not allowed to fix them.      Why?</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Mike Nelitto</em></strong> <strong><br />      </strong> Trenton, NJ    </p>    <p>      Believe it or not, the shop's refusal to fix temporary      "donut" tires is something you might ultimately be thankful      for. Small spares are inherently dangerous and were only      invented to increase trunk space. Better to replace the      factory donut immediately with a normal sized rim and tire.      It is not only infinitely preferable in the case of a flat,      but can also be rotated into the mix and extend the life of      your tire set.    </p>    <p>      <em>If your car or truck is getting you down and</em>      <em>you need some practical answers fast, write</em>      <em>Jon at</em> <em>"MOTHERS</em> <em>Mechanic," c/o</em>      <em>MOTHER</em> <em>EARTH NEWS, P.O.</em> <em>Box 129,      Arden, NC or</em> <em>via E-mail at MEarthNews@aol.com      .</em> <em>Don't forget to include your phone number</em>      <em>and a photo.</em>    </p>
