                            <p>      Here in the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey where I      live, the whippoorwill returns from its wintering grounds      along the Southeast coast, Florida, the Gulf Coast and      Mexico and is first heard in mid- to late-April. It leaves      in early September, though I have occasionally heard the      call as late as mid-month. The slightly larger      chuck-will's-widow has a different, less insistent call and      spends its springs and summers in the southeastern U.S. The      smaller poorwill is found across most of the West. Both      feed during the night, capturing insects while in flight,      and spend most of their daytime hours resting on the forest      floor. Interestingly. the whippoorwill does not construct      nests; it usually lays its eggs on dead leaves or decaying      wood.    </p>    <p>      There seems to be a decline in the numbers of whippoorwills      in many places, presumably due to deforestation. That's a      great shame and not only because this bird is a marvelous      flyer, but also because it is a living, insect-eating      machine. The call of the whippoorwill carries long      distances, and several birds singing in tandem have been      known to keep folks awake at night. But those of us who      love nature would rather lose sleep than hear the pinewoods      silenced forever of their haunting cry.    </p>
