                    <p>      <strong>Will genetically modified<br />      crops save us or sink us?</strong>			</p>			<h5 id="byling">      By Marguerite Lamb, Sam Martin,<br />      Mort Mather, Matt Scanlon<br />      and Michael Seeber    </h5>        <p>      When members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) met in      Seattle last fall to discuss global trade issues,      negotiations were unexpectedly shut down by the shattering      of shop windows and police in body armor. Nearly 35,000      demonstrators from around the world clogged the city's      streets to protest what many saw as the closed-door      politics of global food corporatism. Meanwhile, the 137 WTO      delegates were there-rather skeptically by all accounts -      to iron out labor issues, decision-making policy and to      discuss what to do about a tense and growing international      food scare: the potential dangers of genetically modified      (GM) food. Instead, tear gas canisters and rubber bullets      littered the streets, 400 protesters went to jail and the      WTO went home stunned and empty-handed. Why? While the      immediate reasons involve an arguably overzealous response      to recent headlines, the root causes can be traced back to      a small seacoast lab, more than a century ago.    </p>     <p>      In 1874, Luther Burbank, a 26-year-old farmer's son from      Lancaster, Massachusetts, with an elementary school      education, had the unprecedented idea of taking the pollen      from one plant and fertilizing the fruit of another - thus      creating a hybrid. He didn't know if the qualities of the      male or the female, would dominate, but the experiment was      an interesting gamble. In his 55 years of working with      plant species, Burbank produced over 800 strains and      varieties. Among these was the Burbank potato, developed to      combat the devastating potato blight affecting Ireland's      crop. He sold the rights to his lifesaving potato for $150.    </p>    <p>      In the 1950s, scientists began exposing seeds to X-rays,      hoping to jostle the genes inside. It worked, and mutant      varieties were the result. They selected from these and      were able to develop some new varieties that were      worthwhile, but the process was largely hit-or-miss and no      less time-consuming than hybridization.    </p>    <p>      The science took a giant leap forward when the first gene      was transferred between plant organisms in 1973. Such      engineering involves the splicing of a gene from one      organism into another. Every gene - whether of bacteria,      plant or animal - codes for a specific protein. Thus, when      you insert a foreign gene into an organism, you prompt that      organism to produce a non-native protein, changing its      basic structure at the cellular level.    </p>    <p>      Just 14 years after the initial experiment, the first      genetically engineered plants were grown outdoors. By 1995,      these plants were growing on commercial acreage. Today,      more than half the nation's soybean crop is genetically      engineered. Modified soya is now in so many foods that it      is very difficult to keep it out of your shopping cart, try      though you might. There is no labeling requirement. The      only way you can be assured that what you eat has not been      genetically engineered is to grow it yourself or to buy      food that has been certified organic.    </p>    <p>      So what? Is there any reason someone should not want to eat      genetically altered food? To date, nobody knows for      certain, and that lack of certainty has thrown thousands of      jobs, untold fortunes and the general health of billions of      people into a blind trust. And trust may never again come      so easily to the dinner tables of the world.    </p>		<h3>Stirring the Pot		</h3>    <p>      The current wave of anxiety concerning engineered food      began in early 1999, when a biologist named Arpad Pusztai      fed potatoes to rats in Aberdeen, Scotland.    </p>    <p>      The experiment Pusztai performed at the Rowett Research      Institute was meant to test whether GM crops designed to      produce an insecticide - in this case potatoes patented by      the Swiss company Novartis - could be harmful or toxic to      animals. He found that rats fed the GM potatoes for ten      days developed intestinal deformities and seemed to have      weakened immune systems compared to rats that were fed      natural potatoes. Even before the experiment could be      properly checked, Pusztai appeared on national television      pillorying GM food, consequently handing radical      environmental groups and already panicky consumers a reason      to fear GM crops as a health hazard.    </p>    <p>      In retrospect, it's no coincidence that the public outcry      over food safety began in Britain. It was the English,      after all, who discovered BSE, or mad cow disease, in their      livestock, an epidemic that has killed (or was a material      reason for the killing of) more than a million head of      cattle since 1991. Some 1,500 cows were destroyed because      of BSE as recently as last year. Needless to say, the      European public was already on edge about the safety of its      food. That fear was exacerbated last year, when Belgium      removed chicken from grocery store shelves after some of      the meat was found to have a high content of toxic dioxin.      And as if that wasn't enough, Coca Cola was forced to      recall $103 million worth of Coke in Belgium after      consumers complained of nausea, dizziness and headaches.      Small wonder GM foods were met with resistance.    </p>     <p>      And yet what do the facts of Pusztai's experiment really      show? Is ten days of feeding potatoes to rats enough      evidence to condemn biotechnology altogether? Scientists in      Britain point out that any normal potatoes fed to a rat for      ten days would stress both its digestive and immune      systems. Pusztai's study was discredited as "dubious      science" by Britain's Royal Society and no other evidence      has since been found to suggest that GM food is harmful to      human health. Likewise, studies at Cornell University, Iowa      State University and in Switzerland have come up empty on      forays into the possibility that GM crops may be harmful to      the environment.    </p>        <p>      Nevertheless, the European public has not wavered. By the      time the WTO met in Seattle last November, the United      States and the European Union were in a trade war. The EU      had banned American beef treated with growth hormones,      while the U.S., in retaliation, imposed 100% tariffs on      certain EU foods like French truffles and British pork.      Meanwhile, McDonald's restaurants in France and Belgium      were vandalized and fields of modified crops in Germany      were trampled.    </p>    <p>      Bowing under public pressure, the EU refused to import any      more GM crops from the U.S. and Canada, thereby setting the      stage for the debacle in Seattle and the latest round of      talks in Montreal this past winter (see " The Biosafety      Protocol "). In the space of a few months, much of the      world had seen the promise and perceived danger of GM food.      . . and opted out.    </p>    <h3>      Governing Business and Safety    </h3>    <p>      Globally, sales of genetically modified seed grew 20-fold      between 1995 and 1998, a remarkable start out of the gate      for a relatively new technology. During that time, the GM      food corporations' promise of safety went unquestioned both      at home and abroad. And the seed corporations enjoyed what      can only be described as a cozy relationship with the U.S.      governmental bodies responsible for overseeing product      safety.    </p>    <p>      With the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) overseeing the      nation's food supply, pesticides have to be approved by the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and new plant species      come under the review of the Department of Agriculture      (USDA). However, when genetic engineering involves breeding      plants that actually kill pest insects, the line between      food and insecticide is blurred. Responsibility quickly      becomes confused. The regulatory response to that conundrum      leaves large holes through which GM seed corporations have      been jumping for years.    </p>    <p>      Consider the FDA decision in 1992: The agency would not      recognize the process by which a food was developed, only      its character. It said, in effect, that if a new strain of      GM potato looks, smells and tastes like an ordinary potato,      then its review is concluded. Any nonaesthetic      modifications - the transfer into a potato of a gene from      the soil bacterium, <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> (Bt),      for example - would not be considered in food analyses. Bt,      a natural insecticide used by many organic farmers, is      already a registered pesticide in the U.S., excusing the      EPA of any further obligation to review Bt crops. The      USDA's responsibility is to make sure that new plant      varieties pose no threat to production agriculture or to      the environment during cultivation. It is enthusiastic in      its support of GM plants and has said as much in numerous      statements, including the following from its Animal and      Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS):    </p>     <p>      <em>Over the past year, there has been a continuous flow of      requests for determinations by APHIS that particular      field-tested organisms have no potential for... risk and      should no longer be regulated. These requests, from      developers of new products produced through biotechnology,      facilitate the entry of the products into the marketplace.      Sixteen new products in seven crop plants were the subject      of such determinations in the past 28 months.</em>    </p>    <p>      Small wonder, then, that the first four years of GM seed      sales were astronomical.    </p>		<h3>The Backlash		</h3>    <p>      But increasing concern among con sumers - in Europe, Asia      and more recently the U.S. - over the unknown health and      environmental hazards of genetically modified organisms      (GMOs) has suddenly got the biotech seed industry      scrambling to assure governments, growers, food processors      and the public of the safety of their products.    </p>    <p>      They look to be losing ground: Among the companies that      have announced they will refuse GM crops are Cadbury and      Nestle (in Europe); the Japanese brewers, Kirin and      Sapporo; Mexico's largest tortilla maker, Grupo Maseca; and      baby food manufacturers Gerber (which, incidentally, is      <em>owned</em> by biotech seed giant Novartis) and H.J.      Heinz. Add these to the dozens of high-profile companies      that have refused GM crops from the beginning, including      Eden Foods, Barbara's Bakery, Newman's Own, Bird's Eye, Ben      & Jerry's, Stonyfield Farm and Horizon Organic Dairy,      and the sum is a public relations nightmare. Even the U.S.      pet food company Iams has said it will reject GM maize for      its dog chow. But the latest blow may sting the most: In      January, Frito-Lay Inc., the enormous snack food division      of PepsiCo, announced that it was jumping on the GMO-free      bandwagon.    </p>    <p>      Monsanto spokesman Dan Verakis was quick to note that even      Frito-Lay admitted its decision was driven not by any      proven health threats, but rather by consumer attitudes. He      dismissed the move as evidence of what he sees as a      potential "niche market for non-biotech grain, similar to      the market that exists for organics" (this, despite      Frito-Lay's status as mainstream snack king).    </p>    <p>      In the midst of this turmoil, the world's largest seed and      agrochemical companies are pooling war chests, as mergers      sweep the industry, leaving just a handful of      megacorporations in charge of much of the planet's food      supply (see " Follow the Money ").    </p>    <p>      While clearly the motive is profit (business is business,      after all), these industry giants also claim more      beneficent aims. This technology, say its proponents, will      help to feed the world, while reducing the use of chemical      pesticides. And, in the very near future, it could produce      foods that are tastier, more nutritious and even      therapeutic.    </p>    <h3>      Feeding People or Pockets?    </h3>    <p>      According to the United Nation's Food and Agricultural      Organization (FAO), nearly 800 million people worldwide do      not have enough to eat. Moreover, the global population is      expected to double in the next 40 years - with the vast      majority of this explosion occurring in underdeveloped,      underfed nations.    </p>    <p>      "We know this means that agricultural output and production      needs to increase by 70%," says Monsanto's Verakis. "And so      how do we do that? Clearly, dumping more chemicals on the      ground isn't the answer. I don't think many people would      agree that slashing and burning the remaining rain forests      is a very good approach. Frankly, biotech is not the Holy      Grail either, but it has demonstrated its ability to      increase yield and reduce chemicals."    </p>    <p>      But hunger, at least in today's world, seems to have little      to do with food. Global production systems currently      produce the equivalent of roughly four pounds of food daily      for every man, woman and child on the planet. So why are so      many starving?    </p>    <p>      The FAO identifies poverty and marginalization as the root      causes of hunger in nations at peace, while, predictably,      physical destruction and displacement of people perpetuate      hunger in nations at war.    </p>    <p>      "Feeding the world is not a technology-related problem,"      says Jane Rissler, senior staff scientist with the Union of      Concerned Scientists (UCS), a 50,000-member, nonprofit      watchdog group concerned with the misuse of science and      technology. "It is a problem of wealth and distribution of      wealth. It is a problem of politics. Having a new      technology guarantees very little in the face of poverty."    </p>    <p>      Rissler suggests that the industry is not just misguided,      but duplicitous: "If these companies do want to feed the      world, then why are they trying to sell genetically      engineered crops in the U.S. and Europe? That is not      feeding the world. These companies are trying to play on      our guilt feelings by convincing us that if we don't buy      this technology and make it a success, somehow the world      will not get fed. It's a public relations ploy."    </p>    <p>      As evidence, Rissler points to the fact that, with the      exception of rice, the inexpensive staple and subsistence      crops so important to Third World farmers are hardly on the      minds of the megacorporations. "There is not," she      observes, "a great rush to develop products for the      developing world."    </p>    <p>      To be fair, Monsanto for one did open its St. Louis      laboratories to two Kenyan researchers, whose efforts there      produced a genetically modified sweet potato resistant to      the feathery mottle virus. (Sweet potatoes are among the      world's most important subsistence crops.) According to      Verakis, Monsanto "gave away the technology" and has "no      commercial interest" in the product.    </p>    <p>      Monsanto and the other biotech giants do, however, maintain      a very definite comrnercial interest in the world's major      cash crops - cotton, corn, wheat, soy - to the extent that      they've made seed-saving criminal, compelling farmers to      purchase a supply annually. Critics worry that the high      cost of biotech seed, combined with shrinking alternatives,      may force poor farmers worldwide out of business.    </p>		<h3>Environmental Boon or Bust?		</h3>    <p>      Even as Greenpeace and other environmental groups continue      to staunchly oppose GMOs, the industry holds fast to its      claim of a "green" agenda. Bioengineered seed, say its      boosters, will decrease the use of herbicides and      pesticides, while increasing per-acre yields. Monsanto's      Verakis points for example to cotton farmers, who he says      can substantially reduce their pesticide use by switching      to Bt cotton, which protects against the bollworm. "Instead      of spraying ten or 12 times, farmers who plant our Bt      cotton are now spraying only once or twice, depending on      the size of the infestation," says Verakis. "In much the      same way a silicon chip in a computer is replacing huge      roomfuls of information, we are putting information in a      seed, and that gene, that DNA, replaces tankers full of      pesticides and other chemicals."    </p>        <p>      But are bioengineered seeds living up to their promise? In      1999, genetically modified crops were grown on some 73      million acres in the U.S., roughly a fifth of the nation's      total cropland. Yet definitive evidence of corresponding      pesticide reductions is hard to come by.    </p>    <p>      The USDA compared GM to non-GM plantings in terms of both      pesticide use and crop yields (using 1997 figures), but      cautions that its results are imperfect, since differences      may be attributable to such factors as weather, soil      conditions, irrigation, pest pressures and production      practices. Nevertheless, the department was able to draw      some general conclusions - chiefly that the impact of GMOs      varies considerably depending on the crop and the      technology. In some cases, yields increased while pesticide      use decreased (where, for example, farmers planted Bt      cotton or herbicide-tolerant soy), but there is also      evidence that her bicide use may have increased in some      areas planted with herbicide-tolerant seed. (Such seed      enables farmers plagued by weeds to spray with abandon,      without endangering their crops.)    </p>    <p>      "This is not a slam dunk," says the UCS's Rissler. "One      cannot conclude that this technology has been proven to      increase yield or to substantially reduce pesticide use      across the board. So our question is: With so little      benefit, why are farmers and consumers being asked to take      any risk?"    </p>    <h3>      Are There Human Health Risks?    </h3>    <p>      While so far no human health scare has been linked to GMOs,      concerns that "Frankenfood" could harm life or limb have      consumers worldwide worried.    </p>    <p>      Fueling the frenzy are misleading accounts of cross-species      experiments (see " Fish Stories ") and at least one highly      publicized near-miss involving a Brazil nut gene spliced      into a soybean; researchers discovered that people allergic      to Brazil nuts would also be allergic to the modified soy      and the product was pulled from development before it went      commercial - but not before it raised real doubts about the      safety of bioengineered foods.    </p>    <p>      Critics further worry about the introduction into our food      supply of genes and thus proteins from bacteria and other      nonfood organisms. The fear is that these novel proteins      could prove allergenic or even toxic.    </p>    <p>      But biotech proponents argue that the Brazil nut incident      actually bolsters industry safety claims, since the danger      was identified and the project killed well before it might      have become a public health risk. Monsanto spokesman      Verakis says his company tests its products ad nauseam:      "The director of our regulatory and safety division has      calculated that the number of person hours his team has      devoted to safety testing of biotech crops ...together adds      up to more than 400 years."    </p>    <p>      But critics caution that laboratory results cannot predict      every eventuality (witness the number of prescription drugs      that pass 12 years of clinical trials only to later be      pulled from the shelves).    </p>    <p>      "There hasn't been enough research done," says the UCS's      Rissler. "We are not building a database of information;      this food is not labeled so we can't follow its effects. We      may have already had people who have gotten sick from it,      and we just don't know about it .... If you don't look, you      don't see risk. And that's pretty much where we have been      in this country. We don't look and so therefore we have not      found."    </p>    <h3>      The Next Wave    </h3>    <p>      Already complicated, the debate over genetically modified      food is about to get more difficult. While both sides may      convincingly argue over herbicide-tolerant or      pest-resistant crops, it gets tougher to oppose foods that      may improve nutrition or medicine for millions.    </p>    <p>      Globally, health-care delivery systems are overtaxed, and      advanced practices and pharmaceuticals remain beyond the      reach of much of the world. Verakis suggests that foods      bioengineered to deliver important nutrients or drugs could      prove a significantly less expensive, more practical way to      fight malnutrition and disease on a global scale. His      company is working to engineer healthier cooking oils that      will help to lower cholesterol, as well as a canola oil      high in beta carotene (the precursor to vitamin A).    </p>    <p>      And Monsanto is not alone: Earlier this year, "golden rice"      - a product engineered by Swiss researchers to contain high      levels of beta carotene - made headlines as the next best      hope for the 124 million children in Southeast Asia and      elsewhere who are deficient in vitamin A, a quarter million      of whom go blind annually,    </p>    <p>      But despite its seeming promise, UCS's Rissler isn't sold      on the rice: "It hasn't been proven outside of the      laboratory, in the fields. It's not clear that people will      buy yellow rice [golden rice has a decidedly unnatural      hue]. It's not clear what will happen when people cook the      rice. There are a lot of unknowns, yet the industry just      jumped right on that golden rice, hoping to ride that      little board through some pretty big waves, because they      really needed some good news.    </p>    <p>      "The industry," she adds, "is always criticizing people who      talk about risk, saying it is all conjectural, lout many of      their benefit statements are also conjectural."    </p>    <p>      For his part, Verakis would like to see an end to the      criticisms from both sides, and the beginning of real      discussion: "What we are pushing for is a proper dialogue"      about GMOs, he says. "But if, at the end of the day, you      can't acknowledge the benefits of biotechnology, there is      no room for dialogue. And likewise, if you can't      acknowledge that people have concerns about biotech, there      is also no room for dialogue."    </p>    <h3>      The Hardest Hit: family farms    </h3>    <p>      As with many controversies Surrounding food production in      the last century (the first plant hybrids commercially      introduced in the 1930s and the Alar apple scandal spring      to mind), the biggest burdens of the GMO battle will fall      upon farmers. Combines and trucks are running on fuel that      continues to skyrocket in price, food surpluses have been      driving crop values lower, and now farmers are forced to      contend with an increasingly unpredictable marketplace. In      the short-term, nearly all that GM crops have accomplished      on the farm is to make planting a juggling act, with a      family's security hanging in the balance. Gary Goldberg,      president of the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based American Corn      Growers Association (ALGA), has been fielding reports from      farmers and comparing GM crop yield results since the      plants first appeared in the fields of North America.    </p>    <p>      "If the promise of GM plants, in our instance corn, is that      they will boost yields for the farmer, then we can do      without them. We already have lost $200 trillion in sales      last year because the European Community and others have      refused our corn. And this happened when we already had a      corn surplus. We can't afford to see prices drop any      further but they might."    </p>    <p>      Goldberg goes on to say that even a well-intentioned move      away from GM crops carries its own risks.    </p>    <p>      "The biggest threat facing farmers right now," he reports.      "is the marketplace. Every farmer growing corn has to      wonder if his crop will be sellable by the end of the year.      In this kind of incredibly volatile market ...in which      Seagram's suddenly refuses to accept GM crops, in which      Heinz and Gerber baby foods, Iams and Frito-Lay do the same      ...well, there's no way for a farmer to really plan. It's      making a difficult business much more so."    </p>    <p>      And as if the threat of a continually dwindling national      and international marketplace isn't enough, Goldberg sees a      legal battle looming on the horizon. "Say an organic      farmer's land is next to that of a farmer who plants GM      crops, and GM pollen drifts onto the neighbor's land. Well,      now that organic farmer is out of business because he can      no longer guarantee pure food. We will have farmer suing      farmer, neighbor suing neighbor."    </p>    <p>      As for the safety and reliability of the GM seed and      finished crops, the ACGA is more pragmatic than fearful.      Goldberg explains: "Genetic modification of crops is a      tool, nothing more. If it can boost nutrition and help grow      better crops, then full-speed. Of course we want complete      safety assurances, but our primary job is to get better      food on the table. If GM helps ...great."    </p>    <p>      Bob Cannard of Cannard Farms in Sonoma, California, a      longtime proponent of sustainable agriculture and an      outspoken critic of GMOs, sees repercussions in "enhanced"      food more serious than even bankrupt farmers.    </p>    <p>      "In a few years," Cannard warns, "all the food varieties      and all the plant varieties we have selected and bred for      thousands of years, lovingly, scientifically, will be      thrown away if the current trend continues. And for what?      For plants that resist pests they'd be able to resist      already if we grew better commercially?"    </p>    <p>      Cannard sees GM proliferation as both a complex and      dangerous solution to a simple problem. "Healthy plants      grow well, grow in abundance and largely don't need      pesticides ...something that every sustainable farmer and      organic grower will tell you. Take corn for instance. It      honestly isn't one of my big crops here, but as an      experiment, I planted two pounds of Iroquois white corn      seed, which produced about 4,000 ears. The corn grew      beautifully with minimal attention, and when I picked      through the ears, I found not one corn borer [the pests      that genetically modified Bt corn is designed to fight].      It's not a scientifically complete test," allows Cannard,      "but it helps prove that well-fed and healthily maintained      plants require few pesticides - much less genetic      engineering, which warps their structure forever."    </p>    <p>      When asked what he makes of the GM seed corporations'      assertions that billions of dollars have been devoted to      ensuring that modified seed is perfectly safe, Mr. Cannard      counters: "Any scientist will tell you that mammalian      testing requires at least three generations of observation      and study. Which means that any allergies or other      physiological problems will manifest themselves most      probably in the third generation from ours - our      grandchildren. But there won't be any non-GM seed to revert      to by then. Farmers are having a tough time getting hold of      traditional hybrids even now."    </p>    <p>      Most voices in the community of food producers are not as      strident as Cannard's, but the majority of farmers seem to      be concerned equally about the quality, safety and      sellability of the food they grow. Mort Mather, a longtime      MOTHER contributor and organic grower, sees profitable      possibilities in this concern and hopes for an increasingly      robust non-GM marketplace. "These seed corporations leave      behind many niche markets where farmers can sell directly      or nearly directly to consumers. As con sumers learn more      about genetic engineering and some of the problems that      come with globalization of the food industry, the demand      for locally grown food increases. More and more people want      to have a face attached to their food or to see some label      indicating the food is certified to meet some strict      standard."    </p>    <p>      But at the same time that GM crops may ease open new      markets for organic products, they could also make life      much more difficult for organic growers, warns Mather. "Now      that Bt is in a very large proportion of corn, potatoes and      cotton, it is a certainty that pest insects will build up a      tolerance," he predicts. "Even the scientists who did the      genetic engineering <em>agree that this will happen!</em>      They have said that these crops should be planted with a      buffer [a border of non-GM crops around the much larger GM      field] so that insects that get a nonlethal dose will mate      with insects from the buffer and somehow this will delay      the inevitable a few years. Well, the farmers aren't      leaving the buffers - and the seed companies don't care.      The USDA doesn't care. The EPA doesn't care. And the gene      companies are telling us not to worry, that they will find      something to replace Bt once it becomes ineffective.    </p>    <p>      "Which is more troubling," wonders Mather, "what they come      up with next or the possibility that they will destroy a      safe insecticide and not find a replacement? Either way      they will make organic farming more difficult and      expensive. That's one way to hurt the competition."    </p>    <h3>      The Last Analysis: Do We Care?    </h3>    <p>      Even the most impassioned pleas for more caution in the      proliferation of seed may fall on deaf ears here at home,      according to Thomas Hoban, a professor of sociology at      North Carolina State University and a longtime tracker of      social awareness of food issues. "About one in three people      in the U.S. are aware of the GM food controversy. This      compared to, say, the U.K., where 90% or better of the      general public is aware." The discrepancy is attributable      to a variety of factors according to Hoban, chief among      them a generally enthusiastic European press corps, keen to      report on every turn in the biotechnology road.    </p>    <p>      The second factor is faith. "The public trusts the USDA and      the FDA to care for the food supply, period. There is no      single regulatory voice in Europe anything like those two      organizations, and so, for better or worse, it leaves each      country to come to its own conclusion."    </p>    <p>      In the final analysis, Hoban suggests that we might simply      be too busy to worry about possibly imaginary food dangers.      "To Americans, taste comes first on a wish list, then      nutrition; the mechanics of food production are a distant      third."    </p>    <h3>      To Boldly Go...    </h3>    <p>      Until we can make our own decisions on GM crops and      products by reading labels on tomato sauce cans and bread      bags, genetic experiments will continue to either the      benefit or the detriment of ourselves and or ecosystems. As      a result, there will almost certainly be more genetic      changes in the next millennium than there have been in the      previous twenty. Some will be intended, others not. Will      any be cataclysmic? Will these changes put our species at      risk or will they herald a new age of boundless      agricultural productivity? At the very least, it's worth      more than just a few moments of this kind of consideration      before we meddle with the genetic blueprints holding our      planet together.    </p>    <p>      Related info:<br />      Follow The Money<br />      Congress Steps In<br />      The Biosafety Protocol<br />      Fish Stories    </p>
