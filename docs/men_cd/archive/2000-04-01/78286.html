                <h5 id="byline">      by John Vivian    </h5>    <p>      DRIP! DRIP! DRIP!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Every experienced country householder hasheard it. Not the      tinny little "dripdrip-drip" of aleaky faucet. Nor the      tentative "drip, drap, splat"when the fish tank in your      daughter's bedroomoverflows.</strong>    </p>    <p>      It is the steady, purposeful sound ofwater falling a full      story, ceiling straight tofloor: the sound of a leaking      roof.Unattended, roof-leak water will saturateyour      insulation, soak your wallboard,infiltrate headers, studs      and flooring, andpenetrate your footings to create themoist      channels that attract termites andcarpenter ants. It will      spread into wetspots that encourage wood rot and playhost      to the molds, fungi and slimes that    </p>    <p>      can gang up to convert your home into apile of moist      sawdust. That is, if it,doesn't short out the wiring in the      walls tocause a house fire first.    </p>    <p>      It is these and similar nightmares thatconspire to keep us      awake at night thefirst time we hear a leak from the part      ofthe house that is a total out-of-sight-outof-mind      mystery: the roof. To compound the worry, let ussuppose the      leak is the result of the single    </p>    <p>      most common cause of open-roof-arealeaks in wooded-country      homes...something yours truly has encounteredfour times to      date. You awaken after astormy night of howling, high      winds, openthe front door and step out into anunexpected      wall of wet, leafy green todiscover that a great spreading      lawn tree--trunk, limbs, twigs, leaves, squirrels,      birdsnests and all-has fallen onto your roof.    </p>    <h3>      A TREE ON TI-EROOF    </h3>    <p>      First, check carefully to determinedamage, if any, to your      house. Get up inthe attic and check if rafters are cracked      orif roof sheathing appears bowed or dishedin. Look for      punctures through the roof,where a "flying missile" from a      brokenbranch or the stub end of a splinteredbranch pierced      the shingles and sheathingperhaps the most common form of      serioustree damage to a roof.    </p>    <p>      If there is a new water leak, somedamage occurred for sure.      Nonetheless, itmight not be sufficient to trigger      insurancecoverage. Since rogue windstorms haveproliferated      in recent years, many insurershave quietly expanded the      deductibles thatyou must pay before insurance kick      in.(These changes generally show up in thefine print of      each year's new policy, as wellas in the periodic coverage      update sheetsyou get in the mail. But who reads the      fineprint? We all should.) If damage is substantial,      contact yourinsurance agent and get an adjuster out to in    </p>    <p>      vestigate before you do anything. However,if you're certain      the cost of the repair iswithin the deductible, or if      blowdowndamage isn't covered, or if the tree hit      theuninsured barn or shed, you're on your own.    </p>    <p>      If rain continues to fall, the quickest wayto staunch a      severe leak is to cover thedamaged area (treetop and all if      need be)with a large tarp. Contractors use them tocover      homes till the roof is on. Then, takea breath and take      action. Frequently blowdowns of old, weak orrotten trees      involve broken trunks or thesplitting off of a major limb.      The latter can    </p>    <p>      deliver quite a blow if the break isclean, the tree close      enough to thehouse and if the limb falls from agood height      and hits the roof withfull momentum.    </p>    <p>      When, on the other hand, aliving tree is uprooted by a      highwind gust, it gives up its grip in thesoil with great      reluctance. Most ofits major upwind roots are rippedout or      broken, causing it to hingeover on its unbroken,      downwindroots-all of which tends to reduceits momentum and      break its fall.    </p>    <p>      Note, too, that a tree growing adistance from the home that      isgreater than the height of its trunkwill strike with its      limber branchesonly. Sheet-metal gutters,downspouts and      window glass maybe broken, shutters torn off andsiding      scarred, but little structuraldamage will result. If,      however, a tree is plantedclose enough that the heavy      trunkdoes hit the building, all is notnecessarily lost; it      may be so closethat its arc of fall will be insuffi    </p>    <p>      cient to generate the momentum needed tocause substantial      damage. So it was with oneof our slowdowns. We walked      outside to findthe tree--a young sugar maple that had      beengrowing less than ten feet from the housecasually      leaning, it seemed, against the roof.It must have struck      with a negligible forcethat was absorbed largely by its      branches.Not one of us had been awakened by theimpact.    </p>    <h3>      A TREE OFF THEREOF    </h3>    <p>      If a reasonably sized tree, all but thedownwind quarter of      its root system rippedfrom the soil, is just leaning      against thehouse, you can take a tip from homeownersin      south Florida, where hurricanes are anannual event. Try to      replant it.    </p>    <p>      Before you start working under the tree,be sure it is      firmly lodged in place againstthe house. Toss a loop of      rope around thetrunk, a limb or root. Move away a      safedistance and yank on the rope hard enoughfrom several      directions to make the treewobble. If it wants to fall,      encourage it do sowhen nobody is under it. If a fall      wouldincrease damage to house or plantings, guyit in place      with ropes at each side leading tostout stakes. If in any      doubt at all aboutsafety, call in a team of      professionalarborists. Fix three 100' ropes as high up on      thetrunk as you can get with a ladder, or tiethem on while      working from a window orthe roof. (I like to back in my      pickup truck parallel to the house, with the rearbumper      practically touching the tree, andraise the ladder from the      end of the bed;the feet. of the ladder rest snugly in      thejunctions of the bed floor, the side and theend gate.      Plus, the bed gives me a fewextra feet of height at the      bottom of theladder.) Run two of the ropes out from      eitherside of the tree; stake the loose endssecurely or      else tie them to the bumper ofa truck or tractor or to a      drawbar behind ahorse. These lines steady the tree as      youpull it off the house. Tie the end of thethird rope to      the bumper of a truck,tractor or behind a team of oxen or      drafthorses and pull forward slowly ...till thetree eases      upward on its own and its rootssettle back into their pit.      Tie the threeropes to stakes sunk in a half-circle      aroundthe tree and leave them on for at least ayear, till      the tree regrows its feed    </p>    <p>      er roots. Soak the root mass and keep itwatered (with at      least 1" of water a week),as you would any newly planted      tree.Fertilize sparingly with compost tea or adiluted      general-purpose tree fooddissolved in water.    </p>    <p>      To compensate for lost roots, trim offat least a third-and      preferably a full half-ofyour tree's limbs and greenery. It      willdroop and shed all or most of its leavesand may appear      dead. Keep watering itand be ready to fend off an      occasionalinsect attack. As you know fromgardening, bugs      are attracted to weakenedplants. The tree may show new      growth ata few twig ends almost immediately, or itmay not      try to leaf out till the followingspring. Or it may not      leaf out at all andwill need to be removed. But at least      youtried. Easily transplanted trees such aswillows have the      best survival rates. Deeprooted,    </p>    <p>      hard to transplant varieties such astaprooted nut trees are      most liable tosuccumb to a blowdown.    </p>    <p>      If a blown-down tree is too severelydamaged, its limbs too      deeply imbedded inthe roof, or it's just too large to try      andreplant, it must be removed by peoplewho know how to do      it while inflicting theleast added damage to your house.      Yourbest bet is a team of professionalarborists. A crew of      lithe young daredevilswill arrive adorned with      tree-climbingropes and harnesses, cleated boots      withclimbing spikes, hard hats, chain saws andone or more      ten-ton telescoping-armcranes. They will dissect the tree      intomanageable pieces and haul it off or, if youask, leave      you with a yard full ofcompostable leaves and twigs, a cord      ormore of green firewood-and a massive bill.(Tree work is      among the most hazardousof professions and the company must      payhigh wages and even higher liability andmedical      insurance rates.)    </p>    <h3>      TRACING THE LEAK    </h3>    <p>      You are lucky if a leak reveals itself bydripping audibly.      All too many leakssneak down through the houseundiscovered      ...till you notice a bulge inthe ceiling with an ominous      little darkstain . . . or a dead-gray-colored molddarkening      the wallpaper paste on the backof a patch of peeling paper      ...or an evildark stain slowly drooling down the      wallcovering that conceals the brick of youroutside flue.      You really can't locate thesource of a leak from outside      the house.And you really can't repair one frominside. What      to do?    </p>    <p>      Get your flashlight and trace the leakstory to story, from      drip to source on theroof. Water seldom moves straight      downthrough a building. It will flow downsloping beams for      many feet. It will flattenand move sideways up to 2" by      capillaryaction-and do so repeatedly in its coursedownward.      Look for dark spots in wallsand glinty wet spots in a dark      attic. Lookespecially carefully at the ridge peak, atthe      inside junctions of roof eaves and atticfloor, and around      chimneys and plumbingvents. With the leak source located,      youralternatives are to call in a roofer or trydoing a      patch yourself.    </p>    <h3>      ROOFERS    </h3>    <p>      No roofing contractor is going to stayin business for long      by overcharging ordoing shoddy work, but they all      sufferfrom the tricks of a few itinerant or"gypsy" roofers.      Then there's theoccasional kid who thinks he's learned      itall in a year or two of apprenticing andpromises or      tackles jobs that are over hishead.    </p>    <p>      Worst are the gypsies.    </p>    <p>      Decades ago, they usedto arrive in small    </p>    <p>      country towns with a hot-top    </p>    <p>      tanker truck loaded with a mix of cheapasphalt and used      motor oil. They targetedolder homes with curled-shin-. gle      roofsand dirt drives. The ladders went up andthe goop was      sprayed on in short order.The    </p>    <p>      perpetrators hadcash in hand andwere hightailing itto the      next countybefore the black    </p>    <p>      ooze began dripping off the roof orsticking to the dog's      paws orhomeowner's shoes-a mess which leftthe roof unfixed      and the interior carpetsruined forever.    </p>    <p>      I haven't seen a gypsy hot-toppersince the 70s. Their      moderncounterparts, having read of local stormdamage,      arrive in flashy new pickuptrucks. They dress and speak      well andconvincingly and will try to sell you awhole new      roof-"Doing it all now willsave you money down the road."      Theymay offer a low price or claim they wantto use your      roof as a "demonstrationproject." Their tales of what      anunrepaired leak can do to your home willtop your worst      nightmares.    </p>    <p>      Never hire a roofing contractor wholacks a good-size      office/storeroom, a majordisplay ad in the Yellow Pages and      mostimportant-excellent recommendationsfrom your neighbors      (take the time tocanvass the neighborhood). Expect to      pay$130 a "square"-a 10' x 10' area ofinstalled roofing-and      specify fiberglassasphalt shingles from a recognizable      firmsuch as Certain-Teed or Owens-Corning.Stone,      sawn-wood-shingle or split-shakeroofs cost more, and slates      will run you$500 and up per square.    </p>    <h3>      DO IT YOURSELF?    </h3>    <p>      Before you headto the    </p>    <p>      roof, be honest with yourself: Are    </p>    <p>      j you comfortable on high lad    </p>    <p>      ders? How about getting from			</p>			<p>ladder to roof and vice versa?			</p>			<p>      Feel confident running the roof</p>			<p> ridge with a 75-pound      bundle of    </p>    <p>      shingles on your shoulder? If youranswers are yes, frankly,      you are inthe minority. Most of us are naturallyafraid of      roof heights and unpreparedfor the summer temperatures of      anyroof. No roofing-inexperiencedhomeowner should climb out      onto asecond-story roof or any roof with asharp slope. And      never do high ladderwork or roof work alone; havesomeone      around to call the ambulanceshould you fall.    </p>    <p>      A handy homeowner withgood bal    </p>    <p>      ance, a one-story building and a lowpitch, gritty (good      footing) asphaltshingle roof (which 80% of homes have)can      do the    </p>    <p>      most common roof repairs workingfrom a ladder, a pickup      truck bedor rented scaffolding. Go ahead andfix those leaks      from treefalls orsimple wind damage. Commonareas that need      repair are roofedges, flashing around chimneys orvent      pipes, holes from fallen treelimbs.    </p>    <p>      For pulling nails and cutting and removingshingles, a      roofer s (shingler-'s)hatchet is amust, as is a flat-edged      shovel or nurseryspade.    </p>    <p>      When setting up a ladder, follow the    </p>    <p>      firefighters' rule: Stand with the ladder's feet at your      toes, extend the ladder out to    </p>    <p>      arm's length, and that's the angle    </p>    <p>      at which it should rest against the roof. Steady an uneven      ladder by digging out soil from under the long leg, not      propping the short    </p>    <p>      leg up with a stone or length of wood    </p>    <p>      that can slip or work itself out too easily. Sink a pair of      nails in the house side and lash the ladder to the      building, lest it blow down and strand you on the roof or      slip out from underfoot as you step on or off. You'd need a      pair of tight-lacing rubber or crepe rubber-soled sneak ers      or roofer's crepe-soled, steel-toe boots, along with hip      pads to keep the shingle grit from wearing through your      jeans. You'll also want a roofer's hatchet to drive and      pull nails and cut shingles, a flat-edged shovel and pry      bar to remove shingles and a dispos able-blade utility      knife. The    </p>    <p>      most important materials are a    </p>    <p>      gallon can of asphalt roofing			</p>			<p> cement and a disposable			</p>			<p> ma      son's trowel to lave it on with,			</p>			<p>			plus a roll of 1'-wide      aluminum			</p>			<p>			flashing			(preferably painted			</p>			<p>black on one side so      it won't			</p>			<p> show) and tin snips with which			</p>			<p> to cut it. Get big,      flat-headed gal			</p>			<p> vanized roofing nails in 1" length			</p>			<p> for a      new roof, 1 VV" if the roof    </p>
