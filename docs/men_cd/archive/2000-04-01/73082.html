                        <p>      An inexpensive and easy-to-make doghouse can be created      very quickly by using an old 50-gallon barrel. The barrel,      with one end cut out of it, makes a good shelter where Fido      can get out of the wind and rain. With a little straw for      bedding, the barrel makes a comfortable home.    </p>    <p>      To keep the barrel stable and secure, stakes can be driven      into the ground on either side of it to stop it from      rolling about. The barrel can also be wired to the stakes,      with the wires going over the top of the barrel and      fastened to the stakes on either side. This will ensure      that it does not move about or become dislodged by a      rambunctious dog. The stakes can also serve as a solid      anchor for a chain, if the dog is to be tied.    </p>    <p>      <em>Heather Thomas, Salmon, ID<br /></em> <em>(January      1997)</em>    </p>
