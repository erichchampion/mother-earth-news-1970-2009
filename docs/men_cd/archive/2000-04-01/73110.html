                    <p>      <em><strong>When was the last time that a full moon      occurred on Easter?<br />      Answer: Never.</strong></em>    </p>         <p>      Bearing these rules in mind, we find that Easter can happen      as early as March 22 or as late as April 25.    </p>    <p>      In 2000, Easter falls on April 23. The last time Easter      came this late, or later, was in 1943, when it was      celebrated on April 25. In 2011, Easter will occur on April      24, and the next time it will happen on the latest date      possible (April 25) is in 2038. The last time that Easter      was observed on its earliest date, March 22, was way back      in 1818, and this will not happen again until 2285! In      2008, however, Easter will fall on March 23, the earliest      it has been since 1913.    </p>    <p>      An entirely different question is the date of the first      Easter. Scholars have narrowed down the possible dates of      the Crucifixion: Most are convinced Jesus was killed on      either Friday, April 7, in A.D. 30 or Friday, April 3, in      A.D. 33. My own studies incline me to believe in the latter      date. If that is correct, then the first Easter-what some      Christians now call "Resurrection Sunday" - occurred on      Sunday, April 5, in A.D. 33.    </p>
