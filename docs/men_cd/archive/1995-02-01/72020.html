            		<p><strong>BITS & PIECES</strong></p>		           <h3>The Whole Fish and Nothing But the Fish</h3>    <p>      The recent cutbacks in the fish trade have left many      hard-working people without jobs. The government has      enforced some drastic regulations on those in the fish      business including limiting the grounds that can be fished,      the days each boat can fish, and the size of catches that      are permitted. Although the government's intention is to      try to preserve existing fish stocks, their regulations      have induced a 50% job loss among fish workers.    </p>    <p>      Neptune Harvest, a division of Ocean Crest Seafoods, Inc.,      of Gloucester, Massachusetts, has come up with a way of      putting people back to work and something back in the      environment-recycled fish.    </p>    <p>      Pondering the waste of fish parts that are left when the      fillet (or the parts you and I eat) is cut from the fish      gave the folks at Ocean Crest Seafoods, Inc., an idea. They      decided to turn the leftover fish parts into healthy      fertilizer.    </p>        <p>      While using fish parts is not an entirely new idea, they      use a special cold process in turning the fish into the      fertilizer that is particularly good for your garden. They      take fresh fish and grind it, breaking down peptide bonds      to the smallest element so the fish becomes liquefied.      Salvatore Parco, vice president of Neptune Harvest, insists      on using only fresh fish. "If you're going to start off      with something that smells stinky, you're just not going to      get good results," he says.    </p>    <p>      The fish is not cooked and heat is never used, so valuable      vitamins, nutrients, and amino acids remain intact. Many      fish fertilizers are solubles that come as a byproduct when      cooking the fish. Often processing plants cook at      temperatures ranging from 300 to 500Â°F and many      heat-and light-sensitive nutrients are lost as a result.      The people at Neptune Harvest like to think of their      process as the difference between eating a cooked vegetable      and a raw vegetable. Sure, a cooked vegetable can be good      for you, but a raw vegetable is better. Another perk to the      cold process is that it is less malodorous, making it a      little easier on the sensitive noses of the fish workers.    </p>    <p>      The best part of the fertilizer is that the nitrogen is      high in amino acids, which when added to the soil, slowly      breaks down into basic nitrogen compounds. A slow breakdown      of amino is better because fast release formulations leach      quickly out of the soil and are not available for the      plant.    </p>    <p>      Proof of the beneficial growing properties in this      fertilizer is a whopping 914-pound pumpkin that was grown      by Craig Weir of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Craig was      attracted to the fertilizer because he heard it was high in      nitrogen, which is great for pumpkin vines. The pumpkin      broke the New England record by 196 pounds.    </p>    <p>      Neptune Harvest has been sold commercially in garden      centers for the past five years. In the past year it has      been sold in the retail market. You can pick up a pint for      about $4.99.    </p>    <p>      -Christine Cauchon    </p>        <h3>Attention: Apprentice Gardeners</h3>    <p>      Even if you aren't a horticulturist, the local public      garden could be a great place for you to work this summer.      The American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta      is looking for interns of all ages and backgrounds to lend      a hand (past participants have included career-changers,      teachers, secretaries, retirees, and artists). Over 100      gardeners are ready to give you experience in areas such as      greenhouse operations, mapping and cataloging plants, and      caring for the grounds of historic estates.    </p>    <p>      All of the internships are paid. With the deadlines for      many applications right around the comer, hurry and write      soon to the AABGA for the 1995 Internship Directory      ($5.00), a booklet describing over 500 positions and the      contact person for each. The AABGA is located at 786 Church      Road, Wayne, PA 19087.    </p>
