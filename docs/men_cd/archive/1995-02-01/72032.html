                <p>      <strong>GEARING UP FOR THE SPRING GARDEN</strong>    </p>        <p>      PHOTOS: ALL-AMERICA SELECTIONS    </p>                <p>      Founded in 1933 by North American seed growers to encourage      a degree of uniformity in home seed identification,      All-America Selections tests hundreds of new seed varieties      every year to determine the most athletic growers, the most      disease resistant, and (in the case of both vegetables and      flowers) the most beautiful candidates of the year.    </p>    <p>      Extensive as its vegetable trials are, AAS was unable to      find any new edibles that qualified for special promotion      this year. But this garden seed industry association is      recommending three outstanding flower cultivars that should      be of interest to those who, like ourselves, use      low-growing bedding plants and taller background flowers      only to add color to the vegetable garden. Two of the three      newcomers are everyone's favorite: the petunia, one of      which grows in a unique low, spreading habit. The third is      a giant-flowered version of the American native Brown-Eyed      Susan.    </p>  <h3> Petunia F1 Celebrity Chiffon Morn</h3>    <p>      This is a second-generation hybrid petunia that, like most      floribunda types, grows 18" tall and produces 2½"      blooms 8 to 10 weeks after seed is sown. One unique feature      is the pastel pink leaf color surrounding its cream throat.      The flower is almost fluorescent when planted in      quantity-say, in a circle to accent a birdbath. The      color is likened to cotton candy at the county fair-a      soft bubble gum pink that is striking yet reserved. Unlike      many petunias, Celebrity Chiffon Morn blooms heavily and      continually all through the season. It is light frost and      drought tolerant and perks up with new blooms following      even the worst beating by wind or rain. It does well in the      greenhouse too, so packs of ready-to-bloom bedding plants      will be available this mummer.    </p>    <h3>Petunia Fl Purple Wave</h3>    <p>      It isn't often that a whole new class of garden plants is      developed. But here is the first in what will surely be a      long line of low-growing ground cover style petunias. The      double-hybrid plants are vigorous and each will spread in      an "ocean wave" 2 to 4' across, producing vivid purple,      trumpet-shaped blooms about 2" wide on stems that are no      more than 4 to 6" high. Plants are highly weather tolerant.    </p>    <p>      The seed has demanding propagation requirements and it      needs a lengthy 3 to 3½ months to flower, so you may      want to obtain started plants from a greenhouse. Wherever      grown, the aggressive rooting habit precludes conventional      propagation in unsegregated soil clumps-where you can      just pull apart individual plants in the block without      harming them. Petunia Fl Purple Wave will be sold      commercially in individual 3 or 4" pots or in hanging      baskets. Seed isn't available till after May 1st, so      started plants will not be ready for early spring planting      this year. The variety is unusual enough, however, that a      late-season trial will be worthwhile. AAS anticipates a      strong demand for such an innovation, so get your order in      early.    </p>    <h3>Rudbeckia Hirta Indian Summer</h3>    <p>      You see native Brown-Eyed Susans with their dark brown      centers and golden daisy-shaped petals growing wild in open      fields throughout the East during late summer each year.      Plant breeders have been working for generations to improve      the native plant for garden culture and, with Indian      Summer, they have triumphed. Flowers are the familiar brown      and gold colors, but are 6 to 9" across (compared to      2½"-wide wild flowers). The plant branches so it      needs no staking and is relatively pest and disease free.      It grows 3 to 3½' tall and as much around. The      semilacy foliage has a vivid but coarse appearance, so it      makes an excellent back-of-the-garden plant. The cut      flowers are semirefined in appearance and will last for      many days in water.    </p>    <p>      This nonhybrid is easily grown from seed, producing flowers      10 to 14 weeks after planting. You can buy seed this May      and grow plants in plenty of time for a normal late-summer      blooming period. AAS suggests that <em>Rudbeckia</em> is      best grown as an annual, but we will mulch our own plants      this fall and see if they regrow next spring, thus      establishing the perennials that they are in the wild.    </p>    <p>      Note: Last year, when mentioning AAS selections, we      inadvertently suggested that varieties can be submitted for      testing only by Association members. Not so. Anyone can      offer a newly developed vegetable or flower for      consideration. Successful developers include the large seed      companies, university research stations, and big-name      hybridizers, of course-but also individuals.      Developing a truly outstanding new variety is a rare event      in any garden, home or commercial, but small-scale      gardeners <em>have</em> created hybrids or reselections or      have chanced on natural mutations that have changed the      history of agriculture. The popular Delicious Apple was one      such, and Augustinian Father Gregor Mendel developed the      entire science of genetics while crossbreeding garden peas      in a monastery garden between 1856 and '68. If your garden      grows a flower or vegetable that is truly unique (and can      turn out a whole lot of seed), contact AAS at (708)      963-0770 for requirements. And don't forget to keep MOTHER      posted.    </p>
