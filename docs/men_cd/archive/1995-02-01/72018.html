            		<p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>  	          <p>      <strong><em>250,000,000 used tires are added every year to      "disposal" sites like this one.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Junked Tires Solve Three Problems</strong>    </p>    <p>      Gophers: After watching both young and mature plants      disappear overnight from my vegetable garden, gobbled from      the bottom up by gophers, the following year I decided to      foil those critters by planting in raised beds out of their      reach. Since I didn't have the ability or funds to build      those beds, I used tires instead, stacked two high. I      learned that you have to pack them clear to the rims inside      with soil to keep other critters out, like wasps. I also      found that the heat provided by the tires boosted my warm      weather crops here in the mountains where the summers can      be cool and short. To be on the safe side, I inserted a      tall garden pot in one of the tires to provide additional      protection for the parsley with its long, tempting taproot.      Voila! No more plants lost to gophers.    </p>        <p>      Compost: Burying my kitchen garbage in the compost had two      disadvantages: 1) the wild animals dug it up and ate it,      and 2) in the winter, the heap was frozen and I couldn't      bury the garbage. Now I use a two-bin system, which is      simply two stacks of tires, three tires each.<br />      <br />      The garbage is dumped into one stack and I cover it with a      shovelful or two of dirt (mixed with sand and ashes in the      winter). I chop the garbage and dirt with the end of the      shovel. When one stack is full, I start on the other one.      By the time that one is full, the other is composted. If      you have more garbage than I do, then you'll need more      stacks. They work perfectly. The heat provided by the black      rubber speeds up the composting process, and they are      easily disassembled when it's time to empty them.    </p>    <p>      Deep Planting on Poor Ground: In some places where I wanted      to plant shrubs, the ground was like concrete with      practically no topsoil. I used both car and truck tires to      provide raised beds for them. These contained beds also      made it easier to keep the shrubs watered. In time the      water and nutrients worked on the soil beneath the ground      level so that the roots could expand. Well okay, despite      their advantages, tires are not attractive, so I surrounded      them with stones, piling them up until they covered all the      rubber. The shrubs are happy and so am I.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Joanna James<br />      Mosier, Oregon</em><br />      <br />     </p>		<h3> And It'll Go Faster Too!</h3>    <p>      Hard water and soap stains on plastic or fiberglass tub      surrounds can be avoided by applying boat wax to the      surface when it is new. Car wax will also do the job, but I      think fiberglass wax is better.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Carl Bettrens<br />      Lawrence, KS</em>    </p>        <h3>An Apple a Day Keeps the Burning Away</h3>    <p>      No one is a stranger to the burning, teary-eyed perils of      working with hot peppers, but here's a first line of      defense for your hands. Before cutting into the peppers,      wash your hands, dry thoroughly, and pour a small amount of      apple cider vinegar into them. Rub hands together until      they are wet and then let them air dry. Peppers will be      powerless to burn your hands after that. But you still have      to keep them away from your eyes!    </p>    <p>      <em>-Betty Redden<br />      Taylors, SC</em>    </p>       <h3> Calcium: It Does A Tomato Good</h3>    <p>      My garden is an eight-by-four oval space. I have set out      four early-girl tomato plants and four super-fantastic      tomato plants and three cucumber plants. It has always been      my goal to have tomatoes by the fourth of July and this      year was no exception. Maturity of early-girls is 52-54      days; super-fantastic, 70 days. When I cleaned the garden      out last year, I added calcium. It is very important that      the tomatoes have sufficient calcium: without it, they will      develop blossom end rot. To plant tomatoes, dig a hole      approximately 10 to 12 inches deep and wrap the roots of      the plants in brown paper (from paper bags). Then put some      nitrogen-rich fertilizer in the hole before you insert the      plant. I group my tomatoes together, so they can pollinate      each other, and use a common lattice inserted in the ground      to keep the tomatoes up. Also, plant marigolds around the      perimeter-this will discourage pests that would like      to eat your plants. When the tomatoes start to set, spray      them with a liquid fertilizer. If it doesn't rain, water      them every two or three days to at least one inch deep.      Spray the liquid fertilizer at least two or three times. I      have several pieces of chickenwire that I move around to      keep the birds from eating the tomatoes-the cucumbers      will take care of themselves.    </p>    <p>      P.S. I have given away tomatoes, made tomato juice, and I      am going to sun-dry some and <em>still</em> there are      tomatoes EVERYWHERE.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Chloe Chitwood<br />      Knoxville, TN</em>    </p>        <h3>Two Bright Ideas</h3>    <p>      During the winter and early spring, as I plan my garden and      other projects for the upcoming summer, I also draw up a      list of the tools and materials I will need. When I happen      across a missing or broken item (an invariable occurrence      all winter long), I jot it down. When warm weather arrives,      my garage sale "shopping list" is ready. Last year I found      almost everything on the list, including a crowbar and      pitchfork, and never once was caught in the middle of the      garden without that crucial tool.    </p>    <p>      After groping in the dark for matches during a recent      electrical outage, I was determined never to be caught in      that predicament again. Now, I tape a book of matches under      the hollow base of every kerosene lamp in the house.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ruth F.
