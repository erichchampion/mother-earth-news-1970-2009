                <p>      <strong>GEARING UP FOR THE SPRING GARDEN</strong>    </p>         <h5 id="byline"> By John Vivian</h5>        <p>      It wasn't till one evening in June-a little more than      three years after quitting the city rat race and moving      onto a little New England hill farm-that I began to feel      deep down that I'd really arrived on the land.    </p>    <p>      I'd collected the eggs, fed and watered stock that morning,      put supers on the beehives, worked the gardens, and fed the      weeds and thinnings to the rabbits and goats over the      afternoon. Then my wife and I and some special guests (the      kind who help cook and clean up) sat down to a feast that      no restaurant offered and that no grocery could      provision-our first 100% fresh, 100% chemical-free      (and nearly cost free to boot), 100% home-raised meal. The      entree was crisp on the outside, succulent inside haunch of      spring chevon (that's kid-young goat) I'd      spit-roasted on the hearth. We had roasted White Mountain      potatoes from the cold cellar, wheat bread still steaming      from the woodstove oven, sugar snap peas and young beets      with greens from the gardens, and a      half-cultivated/half-wild green salad dressed with      home-pressed apple-cider vinegar-all of it washed      down with homemade dandelion/citrus wine and pioneer coffee      of ground roast white oak acorns and chicory root.      Highlights were a sauce for the chevon made with our own      honey, cracked turnip (mustard) seed, vinegar, and fresh      grated horseradish, crisp but tender asparagus almost two      inches thick at the base, and strawberry-rhubarb pie from      the asparagus/strawberry-rhubarb/horseradish bed I'd put in      during our first spring on the place.    </p>    <p>      Over the years, goats and other livestock came and went,      vegetables were planted every spring, and the home cider      pressing and wine making was so labor intensive that it      proved to be but a brief experiment. But the      asparagus/strawberry etc. bed fed us with little attention      till real-estate development pushed us farther into the      wilderness. Last I heard it was producing still for new      owners more than a generation later.    </p>    <p>      It is mighty fine to sink your roots and psyche into a      piece of land, even if it's no more than an acre or two and      you still commute to a paying job in town. A good way to      confirm those roots to yourself is to set in plants that      may take awhile to bear, but that will continue producing      for years, decades, or a lifetime. It affirms that you      anticipate a degree of calm and settled, rural, low-tech      permanency in this unsettled, urbanized, high-tech age. If      you'll be able to stay put for a while (or perhaps, even if      you won't) here's how to build an old-time      asparagus/strawberry bed, with plantings of horseradish and      rhubarb that will feed you and yours for 20 years and more.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lasting Harvest</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>My old strawberry/asparagus bed is still      producing...thirty years later!</strong>    </p>       <h3> Asparagus</h3>    <p>      Asparagus is a member of the Lily family of long-lived,      storage-rooted perennials. It originated in coastal Eurasia      and came to North America with early settlers. With few      cultural demands other than an absolute need to be chilled      well over winter, one variety or another will grow      practically anywhere but in the Deep South. Indeed, it      naturalizes easily; the red seed berries produced by mature      female plants each fall are relished by birds, and they      scatter the seeds widely in their droppings. Once you've      grown your own asparagus, you'll begin noticing the      distinctive fern-like greenery reaching above grasses and      low weeds in fields, meadows, and along roadsides      everywhere. Fronds grow three to four feet high with a      fine, lacy umbrella high up on the thin, woody stalk that      allows the sun to filter through. So, you can plant low      growing, broad leaved annual vegetables or biennial      strawberries between the asparagus rows and they will      thrive.    </p>    <p>      Commercial growers propagate asparagus roots from seed, dig      them when dormant in late fall of their first, second, or      third year, then wash, sterilize, and store them      bare-rooted over winter for sale early the following      spring. Most roots sold are two-year-olds that will be      ready for harvest after two more years of growth. I've been      told that only the larger and more vigorous two-year-old      roots are sold; smaller specimens and unsold leftovers are      replanted or left in the ground to grow another year. The      resulting three-year-old "jumbo roots" are not that much      larger and offer no harvest advantage over two year olds,      but cost more. One-year-old roots must be left unpicked for      an extra year before harvest-hardly worth the      dime-a-root advantage in price. In my experience (having      tried all sizes as well as growing from seed), you will end      up with heartier stock that produces better over the long      run with vigorous two year old roots.    </p>    <p>      Here in the Northeast, boxes of dry asparagus roots arrive      at our local farm co-op and some hardware stores and garden      supply houses in late March or April. Most mail-order      seedsmen sell them as well. Price is $4.00 to $6.50 for      bundles of 10 one-year-old roots, a buck more for      two-year-olds, and maybe 80 cents more for threes. When      bought by mail, you can't specify arrival date, as they      aren't removed from cold storage till "time for planting in      your area" late March, April, or May. Most seedsmen won't      mail live plants outside the continental U.S. and Canada.      Plants are grown from sterilized seed in heavily fumigated      land, and are certified to be free of asparagus rust and      fusarium, two soil-borne diseases that seldom kill but can      disfigure spears around the base, making them small,      crooked, and tough, and that generally debilitate the      plants. California prohibits their import altogether.    </p>    <p>      Asparagus roots resemble nothing so much as octopi too long      out of water: a cluster of ugly gray-brown, foot long,      pencil thin, rubbery single strand roots dangling limply      from a central disk. They usually arrive in the mail packed      in sawdust and are better stored dry in the heat of the      kitchen than down in a dank cellar where they will absorb      water and sprout a luxuriant blue-green mold. Indeed, if      you order by mail, I recommend that you immediately remove      the roots from the packing and dry them out. I'll bet you a      serving of asparagus with hollandaise sauce that they are      already a little moldy. Don't wash them. Just let them dry      well and the mold will go dormant (and be eaten by soil      organisms once roots are planted). If they must be kept for      more than a few days before planting, untie the roots and      put them loose in the main body (in dry air) of your      refrigerator till planting time.    </p>    <p>      A bundle of 10 roots will fill about 20 feet of row and      produce four to five pounds of spears per year over a      month-to-six-week cutting period. That means that for each      one pound of spears you will need a pair of mature roots,      requiring three to four running feet of row (rows and roots      in the row spaced 18" to 24" apart). To figure out how many      roots to plant, buy enough store asparagus to provide side      dishes for the family. A one-pound bundle will be ample for      most. Decide how many times a year you want asparagus      (including frozen meals). Multiply the pounds used per meal      by two to determine number of roots needed and multiply      that figure by 3.5 to 4 to determine feet of garden row      required. (Example: 20 meal/yr x 1 1b/meal = 20 1b/yr x 3.5      row-feet for the pair of roots needed to produce a pound of      spears = 70 row-feet, needing 35 roots.) If your garden is      the typical 25 feet wide, that's three rows taking up seven      or eight feet at one end.    </p>    <p>      For years, Mary Washington (a reselected, open-pollinated      variety) was the standard for home gardens. It is still      sold (as is Waltham, the even earlier standard variety),      but these days you can find a wider selection. A good      choice for mild climates such as the Pacific Northwest, the      Southwest, and Southeast is UC 157...(12 roots for about      $15.00 from Johnny's Selected Seeds). The best-adapted for      most of North America is the Jersey Giant/Knight hybrid      developed by Rutgers University. It ignores asparagus root      and crown rots, resists rusts, and produces mostly male      plants which, being spared the chore of making berries and      seed, live longer and produce more heavily than the ladies.      If you do get a female plant that produces small red      berries, don't try planting its seed, which will be      open-pollinated and of uncertain quality.    </p>    <p>      If you do want to try growing from seed, production will be      delayed an extra year while you grow seedlings in a nursery      row for conventional transplantation. Burpee sells Mary      Washington seed (along with its roots and roots of Jersey      Giant and UC 157). But so far, seed is the <em>only</em>      way so far to obtain Viking KB3, a new hybrid widely      adapted for heat and temperature extremes and recommended      for both the Great White North and for the South. It was      developed and is sold by the Canadian seed house, Stokes.    </p>        <p>      <strong>In asparagus rows, dig a trench 1.5 feet deep and      wide, mounding soil in a 6 inch high ridge down the      middle.</strong>    </p>   <h3>Strawberries</h3>    <p>      For luscious red fruit that begin to appear when the      asparagus is almost gone by, set strawberry plants between      the rows of asparagus roots. The berry plants do well if      planted one foot apart, in rows two feet apart. Since      asparagus is spaced two feet apart in rows the same      distance apart, purchase twice as many strawberry plants as      you have asparagus roots.    </p>    <p>      Like commercial asparagus roots, one-year-old strawberry      plants are dug in the fall and stored bare-root over winter      for sale in early spring. Bundles of 25 go for $5.00 to      $12.00. Traditional June-bearers turn out one large spring      crop and come in the largest variety for the widest range      of growing conditions. Everbearers produce a large crop in      June and a single, smaller crop of smaller fruit in the      fall. Ozark Beauty is a widely adapted everbearing variety.      The new Day-Neutral varieties set and ripen berries year      round, with a larger crop at one end of the season, or the      other, or both.    </p>    <p>      I've tried them all and find that I get more seed than      berry anytime but June. I keep experimenting with new      varieties; but for guaranteed pies, jam, and pigging out on      vine-ripe berries, eaten out of hand in the berry patch, I      stay with June-bearers. Most are self-pollinating; but to      be sure you get a good crop, plant at least two varieties.      Buy plants locally or get Raynor's and other strawberry      growers' catalogs advertised in Mother. Grow several      varieties recommended for your area. If one proves to be      far superior, transplant its runner-born plantlets out into      your entire bed. Or (as is best every five years anyway)      buy all new disease free parent stock and renew the bed. In      gardens located from Central Pennsylvania to Northern      Michigan to Coastal Maine, I've never found a more reliable      strawberry variety than Sparkle.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Spread strawberry roots so that they're alt      covered, but just the bottom of the bud is well      underground.</strong>    </p>    <h3>Rhubarb</h3>    <p>      Anative of Turkey, and best adapted to cool climates,      rhubarb is one of the few garden plants cultivated for its      stems only. Leaves and roots contain oxalic acid among      other poisons and are toxic. Don't plant anywhere toddlers      can get at it.    </p>    <p>      The best way to obtain plants is to convince a gardening      neighbor that her plants are overgrown (which they probably      are). At anytime of year, but best done when the plants are      dormant, drive a sharp spade down through the middle of any      rhubarb plant and grub out whichever half comes most      easily. Put compost in the hole and the mother plant will      be spurred into renewed vigor. Divide the reddish,      knobby-topped root cluster into quart-jar-sized cuttings      and pop into your garden. Or you can buy divisions at most      garden supply houses in the spring. I don't know of any      mail-order sources, as the plant divisions are bulky and      cannot be shipped bare-root and dry.    </p>    <p>      To harvest, pull the large, thick stems away from the plant      base, big spade-shaped petiole, and the lower end and all.      Snap off the leaf, wash the stem if needed, and cut into      half-inch sections. For a crisp, tangy stewed fruit dish,      cook slowly till juice is out and pieces are just      soft....simmer with ap-inch of salt and an equal amount of      sugar in just enough water to cover the pan bottom. Don't      cook too long unless you like it broken up and slimy. Mix      uncooked with equal amounts of halved strawberries and      white granulated sugar for a tart pie filling.    </p>    <p>      From my great Aunts, I learned to cook early rhubarb with      rehydrated dried fruit (home-dried apricots and      cranberries, California prunes and raisins) or with      home-canned sour cherries. We enjoyed it chilled in bowls      as stewed fruit, as a filler for tarts, or spread on bread.      This was how the old-timers "stretched" one of the first      harvestable garden crops of the year.    </p>   <h3>Horseradish</h3>    <p>      This big coarse rooted member of the Mustard family is a      hardy and vigorous plant with rough-looking leaves and a      root resembling a coarse skinned parsnip some two to three      inches across at top, tapering to an inch or less and      breaking in the ground at a length of six to 12 inches. A      South Eastern European native, it has been adding tang to      meals on this continent since the early 1700s.    </p>    <p>      Maliner Kren is the standard Bavarian cultivated variety.      You can buy cuttings by mail in lots of five or six for      about $1.50 per root. Cheaper and easier is to get a few      roots from a gardening neighbor (late fall is best, but you      can dig them anytime of year) or buy roots from a fancy      greengrocer. Slice each root into four to 12 four-inch-long      pencil-sized slips. Be sure that each contains a section of      outer hide and a portion of the buttonlike flat top (where      leaves once grew and will sprout again). Let the cuttings      dry till the cut sides cure. I like to plant them in late      winter-flat top up-an inch or so deep in a 6"      pot filled with potting soil and keep them on a sunny      windowsill till leaves come up. When soil is warm, I      transplant them outdoors, mulch, and forget them till they      are dug up in the fall and stored in the cellar with other      root vegetables.    </p>    <p>      Horseradish is best if peeled, grated, and used fresh (a      section of washed-but not peeled-horseradish      root and a grater along with a cellar of coarse salt are      traditional accompaniments for spit-roasted beef and      Yorkshire pudding in our house). Or, mix gratings and their      juice with salt and white vinegar and keep in the      refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      If left in the soil for more than a season, the plants will      expand aggressively and your garden will soon be choked      with a solid block of woody and unusable horseradish that      is so thickly matted and has roots down so deep that it is      nigh impossible to grub out.    </p>    <p>      Practical choices are to: (1) Dig it all each fall and      replant cuttings next spring or (2) Box it in with      escape-proof edging. I do both-growing new cuttings      each spring inside squares or rectangles of foot-wide scrap      lumber buried in the ground so only the top inch or so      protrudes. Inch thick pine lasts four years or so before it      needs replacing. That green PT lumber that's      pressure-treated against rot would last longer, but I don't      want copper arsenate or whatever in the food garden. You      could install roof shingles, flashing, or corrugated metal      lawn edging around just so that the barrier sticks up above      ground and extends six inches down.    </p>        <p>      <strong>A cross section of the asparagus trench during      planting.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Planting horseradish is more than easy; stick a chunk of      root in the soil and it will grow. However, in our rocky,      shallow New England soil, any root vegetable can be hard to      dig. And when you get it out, the root will be bifurcated      or worse from snaking around rocks. I want juicy roots that      are thick enough to have something left after their rough      rinds are peeled away, and that are uniform in shape and      easy to grate. So I pick out rocks and when compost, rotted      manure, or augmented peat moss goes in to enrich the bed, I      also pitch in enough sharp sand plot that the soil is loose      to a foot depth. A square yard will grow about fifteen      roots and produce a quart or two of gratings plenty enough      for most families for a year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hard Work</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>I used to dig the deep bed by hand, but that was      when my back had a few less miles on it.</strong>    </p>    <h3>Preparing The Bed</h3>    <p>      Asparagus is what's called a "deep, heavy feeder." Its      roots are a foot long when you get them and will grow down      another foot and more. To produce an abundant harvest of      thick, juicy spears (in excess of those it needs to      regenerate) each spring for a generation, they must have a      good stockpile of plant food down where the roots are.      Which means that the best planting bed is a deep trench      filled with rich soil packed with organic matter that will      attract earthworms and continue to decay and produce      nutrients for years. I've been known to dig an asparagus      bed by hand with a spade and garden fork, but that was when      my back had a few less miles on it. A perennial edibles bed      is one of the best reasons I know for (lacking a farm      tractor with a backhoe or digging bucket on the front)      investing in a big rear-tined rotary tiller. A good reason      for keeping a horse too.    </p>    <p>      Whatever your soil source, mix in a winter's output of wood      ash or a good sprinkling of ground limestone to add      potassium and trace elements and to neutralize acids.      Asparagus is not all that picky as to soil pH, but nearly      all North American soils are more acidic than it likes, and      it will benefit from some ash or lime to sweeten it. It is      best to consult your local Cooperative Extension Service or      other expert sources for proper lime-application rates for      your soil.    </p>    <p>      However you get it done, dig your bed as deep as you can      manage. A yard down is ideal. First, remove the upper layer      of dark topsoil and lay it to one side of the trench.      Remove the next foot or so of lighter colored semi-rich      undersoil and put it on the other side. Then dig out as      much clay, sand, rocky marl, or whatever pale, base subsoil      you have compost or topsoil to replace. Discard the base      soil. Now, refill the trench with alternating shovelfuls of      top-soil, compost, and whatever additives you have. Fill in      thin layers (stomping well between each layer) to within      18" of the top.    </p>    <p>      Horseradish and rhubarb both grow taller than strawberries      but not as high as asparagus ferns. They are dense and will      shade the berry plants so I locate them on the ends or the      north (shade) side of the bed. I prefer to locate the bed      at the top (north) of the middle garden (with staked      tomatoes, tall sunflowers, corn, and pole beans above it. I      then set rhubarb plants all along the upper margin and put      rhubarb in one or two boxed plots along the sides. I choose      the lowest, coolest, and shadiest end of the bed for      horseradish. It will grow practically anywhere; in shade,      roots will just be smaller.    </p>   <h3> Planting</h3>    <p>      Lay out asparagus rows two feet apart. In each row, dig a      trench a foot-and-a-half deep and wide, mounding soil in a      6"-high ridge down the center of each. Set a root alongside      the ridge every foot and a half to two feet. Starting at      the sunniest end of the row, scoop ridge into cones by each      crown. Arrange the long roots evenly around the cone, cover      with soil, and press firmly into the soil. The top of the      first crowns should be a good foot below the surface. As      you go down the row, make each mount a little higher, till      the last one at the shadiest end of the row is about 6"      below ground level. Now, rake soil in until it is level and      just covers each crown. Leave it loose. Over early spring,      as the shoots appear, rake soil in to cover them until the      trench is full. The small first-year fronds will nourish      the roots all summer. Keep weeds down and mulch the soil      against summer dryness and heat.    </p>    <p>      Once your asparagus has grown tall enough that you've      filled the trenches level, plant strawberries a foot apart      down the center of the open strips between asparagus      plants. Cut the raffia holding plants in bundles, remove      dead and discolored leaves, and put the plants in a bucket      of warm water. In the garden, dig a fan-shaped slit in the      ground. You'll find that a new berry plant has a crown of      leaves, a firm, grape-sized bud, and a bunch of small roots      growing down from the bud. Spread plant's roots out in a      fan shape and insert them into the slit so that all roots      are covered but just the bottom of the bud is underground.      If planted too deep, the bud will suffocate. If planted so      shallow the tops of roots are exposed, they will dry out      and the plant will die. Press soil very firmly around      roots. Make a small rain-holding saucer in the soil around      each plant and water well with a weak solution of liquid      fertilizer and tepid water. Mulch with straw, weed-free      hay, or other loose organic material and keep soil moist      till plants are bushy with new leaves.    </p>    <p>      The strawberry plants will try to fruit, but don't let 'em.      To force energy into root storage for a bumper crop next      season, pinch off first-year flowers as soon as the little      sprays of blossoms sprout. Each plant will also put out      runners that will grow new plants at every      node-resulting in a mat of new plants that will all      fruit the next year. Left alone, in two years or three, a      berry bed will become a thick mass of plants that produces      few berries. In small plantings, you can be picky and guide      and prune runners and thin plants. I find it easiest to let      them go wild, but each fall I take out every other 2'-wide      row (starting with the original parent plants the fall of      their fruiting year; the next year taking out their      offspring in the rows to each side of the originals and so      on, alternating every year). Though it sounds wasteful,      this is the best way to have good strawberry crops year      after year. Rototill the soil in a good 18"-wide band even      if a lot of berry plants are jerked on still-strong runners      from the fruiting beds to each side. Plants remaining will      have the bare ground to flower, fruit bountifully, and fill      the bare strips with vital new plants next year.    </p>    <p>      Set rhubarb root divisions into the soil so that the tops      of crowns are just visible. Place them two feet apart in      all directions. Don't cut any stalks the first year. Next      year, pull (don't cut, pull off from the base) only a few      large, fat stalks. Thereafter, you can pull fully grown fat      stalks till the June strawberries are gone by. The large      leaves are mildly toxic, so snap them off and leave them to      compost down around the parent plant. They go flat and make      a good weed deterring mulch.    </p>    <p>      Once leaves are fully grown in spring, plants produce a      large flowering stalk from the middle of the plant. It will      develop an obscene looking fist-sized (and shaped) lump of      a flower bud at the terminal end that will erupt into a      great ugly conical mass of blossoms if you let it.      Flowering is futile, wastes a great deal of plant energy,      and the whole plant looks droopy stemmed and exhausted in      its summer long afterglow. So, let the flowering stalk      develop till the bud is up at about leaf-top level. (The      plant will grow another if you pinch it out too early. May      try anyway.) Cut it out at the base. The plant will grow      lustily all summer, produce profusely next spring. Of      course, it will get all pouty and try to flower again next      summer and you'll have to dampen its ardor again.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Good Planning</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Strawberry plants will try to bloom in the first      season. Don't let 'em.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Boxed horseradish will keep the rest of the bed      from being overrun.</strong>    </p>  <h3> Harvest</h3>    <p>      The first growing year, don't pick anything. Leave      asparagus, strawberries, horseradish, and rhubarb to grow      and accumulate strength in their roots. Pick blossoms from      strawberry plants and flowering stalks from rhubarb.    </p>    <p>      The second year, strawberry plants come into full      production, so harvest them all. You can cut a few fat,      plump asparagus and rhubarb stalks, but just a few. Keep      them, ends in water, in the refrigerator and they'll last      till all plants have contributed. Let the rest of the      stalks go to leaf.    </p>    <p>      The third year, pick away. A fully grown asparagus plant      produces perhaps 10 spears a year to reach its half-pound      output...the first set of thick spears up to 2" at base and      1/2" at top, and a second set that is under 1" at base,      3/8" at top. You can safely harvest five or six spears per      plant over four weeks. After that, the plant needs to make      fronds to store. Spears should be harvested when they are 6      to 8 inches high, while buds on the ends are still tightly      wrapped.    </p>    <p>      Pencil-thick, hard stalks should never be cut, as they      indicate that the plant is reacting to stress and needs all      the strength it can gather. This "pencil-grass" is too      tough to eat anyway.    </p>    <p>      You can use a long handled V-blade dandelion weeder as an      asparagus knife, and cut off spears several inches below      ground. Problem is you are buying a lot of garbage; the end      of each spear is bleached white, woody, and inedible and      usually gets thrown out. Better to harvest only the edible      portion, leaving the below ground ends to recycle naturally      and return to the soil. Poke your fingers an inch or so      down into the soil beside each spear and snap it off      briskly with your thumb. Where the spear just naturally      breaks is a comfortable 1/2 inch or so above where the      woodiness begins.    </p>    <p>      Harvest rhubarb stalks so long as they keep growing out fat      and juicy, or till the flower stalk appears and leaves      begin turning red at the ends. Every few years is a good      time to divide rhubarb. In early spring, cut off one or two      quart jar size chunks of root from the larger specimens and      plant them out or give them to friends. Any plants that      have lost vigor and quit producing really fat spears each      spring should be removed and new cuttings planted into      fresh compost in their place.    </p>    <p>      In late fall (of the year you planted the cuttings, don't      let them grow a second year) after a good frost or two, is      the time to harvest your horseradish. I dig up the entire      bed with a garden fork, shake the roots free of soil, and      lop off the leaves. Thick, well-proportioned roots are      stored in the cold cellar for peeling and grating as      needed. Any so gnarly as to be unusable roots or any with      soft spots or other apparent rot are saved to be cut up for      replanting. The soil in the bed is forked well and mixed      with enough compost or top soil to replace plant material      removed. I replant the saved cuttings and mulch with the      leaves from parent roots just dug up. Horseradish gives a      lot for very little care in return.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Damage Control</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Severe rot problems can only be overcome by      uprooting and burning the bed.</strong>    </p>    <h3>Disease and Pests</h3>    <p>      The best medicine against problems of all kinds is      prevention. Weeds can choke out the bed and bugs will      hibernate at the base of the plants, so in the spring of      each year cultivate any bare ground shallowly to expose bug      larvae and sprouted weed seeds. In summer of the first      year, once the soil dries out, snug mulch around asparagus      fronds, berry, rhubarb, and horseradish plants to keep      weeds down. Hand pull large weeds that poke through.    </p>    <p>      You will see rust, malformed stalks with brown-tinged      lesions around the base, on a few asparagus plants, but the      stalks are still delicious and most varieties are resistant      enough that it won't do significant harm. In the heat of      summer some years, the fronds will host a considerable      gathering of asparagus beetles-colorful little red      and black semi-hard-shelled bugs that are quick to flee and      hard to catch in the heat of day. In my experience, the      little stinkers sleep away from home (they dig into the      mulch, I'm told) and don't come looking for food till the      sun is up. I've never noticed that they do much harm to      fronds (that are old enough by the time the beetles arrive      that they've about done their job of reinvigorating the      roots for next year's crop), so I've never worried about      them. However, I do compost burn the top mulch and old      fronds each fall.    </p>    <p>      If I ever do see the beetles threatening severe damage,      rather than lose the planting I would compromise my organic      principles and apply a USDA-approved, short-lived chemical      insecticide advertised as effective against hard-bodied      insects. Since the rhubarb and asparagus crops are already      in and the new horseradish won't be dug till fall, I      wouldn't worry about getting poison on anything edible.    </p>    <p>      If the leaves on your strawberry plants turn red well      before frost, and/or if the berry plants pull out of the      soil too easily and roots look wet, dead, or puny, and/or      production falls off precipitously, you have a rust or rot      problem. The only cure is to overhaul the bed. To be      honest, relocating it to fresh soil for several years is      best. Otherwise, after hard frost, uproot all the      strawberry plants and burn them in a fire along with all      old mulch and leaves. Plant the bed to a "green manure"      crop such as winter wheat and till it in before the      asparagus gets started in early spring.    </p>    <p>      Now, on the bare ground, let nature take its course and      kill out the strawberry diseases by letting it go      semifallow for a season. I grub out all burdock, grasses,      and other persistent weeds, till shallowly between the      asparagus several times during the year (before any weeds      can go to seed), and finally burn the plot off in the fall.      Burn again in spring just before tilling in fresh compost      and lime and replanting a new lot of strawberry plants. I'm      sure to purchase an especially disease-resistant strain      from a different company than where I got the diseased      stock.    </p>    <h3>Fall Care</h3>    <p>      After the tall greenery turns brown in the fall, pull mulch      away from the borders and, if you've not edged the entire      bed, dig out sod where it has encroached at the sides.      Spread compost or rotted manure and till or hand cultivate      shallowly.    </p>    <p>      Asparagus fronds are tough and don't rototill in very well.      Also, they can harbor bug eggs that will happily      overwinter, tilled into the ground or not. I like to go      down the rows and, using an old (but sharp) hook-bladed      linoleum-cutting knife, grub out all the old fronds as far      below ground as I can cut. I toss them at the base of a      fresh compost pile along with any corn stalks and tough      broccoli and sunflower stems still left in the garden. Or,      I save them to be burned, and the ashes scattered back on      the land. (If stacked up off the soil beside the outdoor      fireplace where I boil off maple sap, these woody stems dry      out under the snow and make great sugaring off fire      kindling.)    </p>    <p>      Then, I go down the rows and lightly rake old mulch and      dead berry plant leaves off of the alternate rows that      contain the new-generation strawberry plants and mound it      over the old plant rows. Then I till it in very well (old      berry plants and all) or (better) burn it and then till. A      good sprinkling of composted manure mixed with soiled      stable bedding goes on the fruiting bed. Finally, over the      whole plot, I scatter six inches of loose salt hay, a type      of grass that is harvested from coastal salt marshes, so it      lacks inland weed seeds. It is expensive inland but you can      use wheat or rye straw. Don't mulch with regular hay unless      it is old and half rotten. New hay is full of weed seed and      will turn your asparagus bed to what we call a "hay-mowing"      here in New England. Lacking a natural mulch, the asparagus      bed is one place I'd recommend spending the money for      ground peanut shells, corncobs, shredded bark, or other      organic mulch.    </p>    <p>      The asparagus and new berry crowns will push right up      through your mulch in the spring, and it will keep the new      berries away from soil-borne rots. Be sure to sprinkle on      limestone some time during the year to neutralize the acid      content of mulch as it rots down, bark especially. To      spread out the harvest, you can pull mulch away from crowns      of half the strawberry plants as soon in the spring as you      can. Sun will warm the soil and those plants will fruit a      few days earlier than the rest.    </p>    <p>      During the fall overhaul, I also pull out and compost old      horseradish and rhubarb leaves and scatter any leftover      compost or manure over the dormant crowns. But I'm sure to      be careful of next year's rhubarb buds that often break the      soil in fall. Then it's just a matter of waiting out the      winter, confident that, in a carefully prepared bed, and      after judicious harvest and good fall "putting to bed," the      asparagus, strawberry, rhubarb, and new horseradish roots      are preparing to gift us with a bountiful harvest next      year.    </p>
