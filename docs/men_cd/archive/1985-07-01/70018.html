                    <h5 id="byline">      by Mary B. Bowling    </h5>        <p>      Only a few inexpensive items are needed to fabricate a      practical tackle box belt, and many of them may already be      lying around your home somewhere just waiting to be put to      good use. The main ingredient, of course, is a belt.      Preferably a cloth belt. (You could use leather, but it's      mighty hard to sew through.) You'll also need a one-piece      plastic soap dish (the kind with a hinged lid), about 18      inches of inch-wide elastic, a 12" length of rawhide thong      or strong cord, a scrap of sheepskin (optional), a stout      sewing needle, some sturdy thread, and several plastic 35mm      film canisters. (If you don't use 35mm film, ask your      friends or the clerk at your local photo shop to save a few      containers for you.)    </p>    <p>      Plan before you sew. Consider which items you want to carry      and where they should be placed for comfort and      accessibility. (Naturally, if you're making the belt for      someone else, you should consult with that person about      such things.) Hooks, sinkers, swivels, and small lures all      fit nicely in the little cans. Flies can also be kept in      the canisters-or hooked onto a scrap of sheepskin.    </p>    <h3>      THE MAKING    </h3>    <p>      Sew the elastic onto the belt in loops sized to hold the      film cans snugly. Similar loops can be created to hold your      favorite fishing tools. (My husband keeps his hook      disgorger handy this way.) Worms, crawfish, grasshoppers,      and other live baits are stored in the plastic soap dish:      Punch air holes in the lid with a red-hot ice pick, and      suspend the dish from the belt by the thong or cord.    </p>    <p>      Many baits, such as salmon eggs and cheese balls, come in      small jars. If you have a favorite, make an elastic loop      for that particular jar. [EDITOR'S NOTE: One of MOM's      staffers swears by Poutzke's Balls o' Fire.]    </p>    <p>      In general, use your imagination to tailor a tackle box      belt that's just right for you-or yours.    </p>
