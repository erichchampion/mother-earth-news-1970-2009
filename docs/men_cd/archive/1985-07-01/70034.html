                <p>      <em><strong>The cookout season is hard upon us, so why not      build . . .</strong></em>    </p>    <p><strong>      STAFF PHOTOS</strong>    </p>        <p>      Summer's the time to enjoy good food, warm weather, and the      company of friends . . . and there's no better opportunity      to bring these things together than at a genuine      oldfashioned cookout!    </p>    <p>      This year, you can make your backyard the envy of every      charcoal chef in the neighborhood. How? By building a      permanent outdoor barbecue that'll not only equal the      performance of the best manufactured grills, but probably      cost the same (or less, depending upon how many components      you can locate used), last longer, and allow you to try out      some fancy cooking techniques in the bargain.    </p>    <p>      As you might imagine, our goals were to come up with a      design that was flexible and multifunctional . . . to      employ a construction method that even a novice could      duplicate . . . to make certain it was cost-effective . . .      and to end up with a good-looking, <em>fine-cooking</em>      finished product.    </p>    <p>      Though it's probably not that obvious from the photos,      MOTHER's barbecue grill is constructed of dry-stacked      concrete block coated with a structural surface-bonding      cement and lined, in the firebox, with common refractory      brick. Expanded metal screens, set at appropriate levels in      the stacked firebrick joints, serve as inexpensive grilling      surfaces; sections of scrap 1/4" metal plate fitted above      the screens create a closed oven environment and can be      lowered without much fuss to become effective griddles.    </p>        <p>      But that's not all. Since draft control is critical to heat      regulation, we've included a stonesimple, and removable,      loading and airinlet door at the front, and-for use      with cooler fires-a similar flue control on the      chimney above a built-in smoker rack. Then, its a final      touch, we fabricated an additional cover plate with an      8-1/2" hole in the center to be used in conjunction with a      wok or a castiron stock pot.    </p>    <p>      In the case of this barbecue, a picture really is worth a      thousand words, so we're going to present our basic design      by means of an illustration and two photos. But we're not      about to set you on your own just yet: A few hints and tips      passed in your direction should help to start you on a      project that'll be just as much fun to build as it will be      to use. And keep in mind that there's plenty of room for      modifications, in the event that you want to make some      layout changes.    </p>    <p>      To begin, you'll want to select a level site in a somewhat      open area. If you don't have a flat place available, you'll      have to make one by digging a slab footing, grading it with      a hoe and square-nosed trenching spade, and checking it      with a level. Take some care with this, because it will      influence the integrity of your finished grill.    </p>    <p>      If frost heaving might be a problem (it probably will be in      most areas of the country), dig the footing several inches      deep and lay sand or gravel in the pit. After the surface      is smoothed, the blocks and firebrick can be set safely on      top.    </p>    <p>      We chose to join the blocks with a surface bond because      that technique will make a successful mason of anyone;      Surewall surface bonding cement (manufactured by the W.R.      Bonsal Company, P.O. Box 38, Lilesvillc, NC 28091) is easy      to apply with a hawk and trowel, is water-resistant, and      can withstand bending and shear stresses remarkable well      because it contains shredded fiberglass strands. The      recommended 1/8"-thick coat has a white, fairly rough      texture, so you may want to add a tinted finish coat later.      Be sure to fill the concrete block cores with sand before      you cap them, as this will provide weight and an evenly      distributed heat sink to stave of stress and thermal      cracking.    </p>    <p>      The firebrick is merely stacked without mortar to allow for      expansion. Likewise, the metal plates should be cut to fit      loosely in their places for the same reason. Don't, by the      way, waste your money buying new steel; scrap prices are      much more attractive, and even though the metal's not      especially goodlooking when you buy it, it can be cleaned      up with a wire brush or a sanding cloth. You may even be      able to find a plate of the right size or get the scrap      dealer to trim a section for you. (A contoured lip or a      section of angle iron welded to the front plate will      prevent the door from falling forward, so keep that in mind      while you scrounge.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, don't be afraid to tackle the fabrication of the      sheet metal door (or the flue control, if you want one)      yourself. "Quick and dirty" is the byword here, and a      hammer and a pair of aviation snips will go a long way      toward seeing this tin-knocking job to completion. The 8" X      24" extension above the sliding-door panel can be either      riveted, welded, or-if you smooth down the      heads-bolted in place.    </p>    <p>      That's it in a nutshell. Look over what we've done, and      feel free to make any changes that might suit your needs or      particular style of cooking. But most of all, enjoy the      warm evenings to come.    </p>
