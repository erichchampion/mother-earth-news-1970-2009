        Dr. Greg Olsen instructs Southwestern Technical College students in techniques of greenhouse retrofit. The students spend about 30% of their time doing actual construction work, such as on this greenhouse that's being added to the Big Y Community Club in Cherokee, North Carolina. The Save the Children Foundation supplied money for materials, and the project is coordinated by Sequoyah Driver (Big Y Chairman) and Dean Suagee (Energy Planner for the Eastern Bank of the Cherokee Indians Tribal Renewable Energy Assistance and Planning Program).
