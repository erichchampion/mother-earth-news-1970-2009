                <p>      Uncommon Corn    </p>            <p>      About 1,500 B.C., cooks in coastal Guatemala figured out      that cooking dried corn in alkali water removed the      kernels' skins and produced a softer dough than unprocessed      ground corn.    </p>    <p>      More recently, food scientists have found that this      process, called nixtamalization, increases the      bioavailability of both protein and niacin, and radically      reduces the toxins often found in moldy corn. The resulting      dough, called masa, is the basis for corn tortillas, chips,      tamales and other specialty corn foods. Whole corn that has      been nixtamalized is called hominy or posole, while the      ground form is called masa.    </p>    <p>      Whether ground or whole, nixtamalized corn "has a taste and      aroma like no other food on Earth-a delicately nutty      quality combined with something almost chalky and      mineral-like," says Zarela Martinez, owner of Zarela      restaurant in New York City and author of <em>The</em>      <em>Food and Life of Oaxaca</em> <em>.</em> She shared the      following recipe for nixtamalizing your own corn:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nixtamalized Corn</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 pounds clean, dried flour-corn kernels (about 1      quart)<br />      1/4 cup pickling lime (food-grade calcium hydroxide)<br />      3 quarts water<br /></em><br />      Rinse the corn in a colander and set aside. In a large,      stainless steel (nonreactive) pot, dissolve the lime in the      water. Immediately wash off any lime that gets on your      hands. Add the corn and discard any floating kernels. Bring      to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and cook      uncovered for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, cool the pot      and let it sit, uncovered, for 4 hours at room temperature      or overnight in the refrigerator. Pour the corn into a      colander in the sink. With the cold water running, rub the      kernels between your hands to rub away the softened hulls      (they will have a gelatinous texture). Rinse thoroughly      (some old recipes say to wash between 4 and 11 times).      Drain well. Use the whole, moist kernels in soups or stews.      Or, grind them through a food mill able to handle moist      kernels to make masa, to which you can add enough water to      make a slightly sticky dough for making tamales or, using a      tortilla press, tortillas. Promptly refrigerate any unused      masa, and use it within 3 days.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>

Homemade salsa makes a great accompaniment.
