                <h1>      The Lowdown on Lyme Disease    </h1>        <p>      The Ixodes scapularis ticks that transmit Lyme disease in      Eastern regions of the United States and Canada have a      two-year life cycle. It begins in early spring, when adult      females lay eggs on the ground. The eggs hatch as      temperatures warm, and the miniscule larvae feed on mice      and other small animals until early fall. They then molt      into nymphs and rest through winter in leaf litter, under      rocks or woodpiles, or anywhere they can find cover. The      following spring, nymphs, which are responsible for the      majority of Lyme disease cases in humans because of their      small size, emerge. In the fall these nymphs molt into      adults. The adults typically climb to tips of grass or onto      shrubs to better grab onto deer (or another large mammal)      as a place to feed and mate. Once mated, the females drop      off, lay eggs, and the cycle begins again.    </p>				<hr />        <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
