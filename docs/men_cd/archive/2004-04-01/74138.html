                		<h5 id="byline">		By Cynthia Barstow	</h5>	        <p>      Eco-eating is no easy affair. It takes care and work to      make informed decisions. Every day, there is something new      to learn about our foods - how they are grown or      raised, what the governmental policies are or are not, and      how farming affects families all over the world.    </p>    <p>      The sad state of our food system can feel daunting; yet I      believe that together we can visit the issues and celebrate      our choices for change. Every day new projects emerge from      creative people offering up potential solutions to      food-related problems. Our job, as shoppers, is to      encourage them and to buy the fruits of their labor.    </p>    <p>      Many of the issues lead to value judgments and difficult      ethical choices. Do we feed the hungry by developing      higher-yielding crops, even if it might harm the Earth? How      can we make good, clean food available to all, not just      those who can afford the higher cost? Do I have the "right"      to purchase genetically modified (GM) foodstuffs for school      lunches when I am responsible for other people's children?      These are some of the questions being asked in      conversations across the country, and ones we each need to      ask ourselves.    </p>    <p>      Our individual decision-making power helps create our food      system - each buying decision we make influences what      is marketed to us. We need to act as "food citizens" by      taking personal responsibility for shaping our food system.      The Wisconsin Foodshed Research Project has defined a food      citizen as follows: "Food citizens are eaters who take an      interest in food beyond its affordability and availability.      Food citizens are concerned about environmental      sustainability, the health of farmers and consumers, issues      of justice for farmworkers and the poor, and democratic      participation in determining where our food system is      heading." So if we decide to take on this responsibility,      how do we start thinking on a personal level about the food      ethics and values?    </p>    <p>      Scholars study agricultural ethics and citizens' groups      take on the topic, too. In March 1997, the Soul of      Agriculture project was launched; Paul Thompson, Purdue      University professor and agricultural ethics author, noted      at one early gathering: "We need a production ethic for      agriculture in which we are all producers, one in which we      come to understand ourselves as partners with nature in      reproducing the social and ecological environment where our      children will themselves face the challenges of production      and reproduction."    </p>    <p>      We all need to be engaged in this movement, no matter where      the connec tion comes from. We are the producers of our own      fare by acting as decision-makers. No matter how we look at      it, every moment we ingest another morsel, it reflects a      choice we have made. It is either good for the Earth and      all of its beings, or not.    </p>    <p>      Of course, we are all humans, struggling to squeeze a whole      meal into a fraction of time. We can only do what we can      do. And yet, I know I feel best when I have made a personal      choice that seems right. When I choose antibiotic-free      chicken for pasta, or when I see my son chomping down on an      organically grown apple, I feel good. When we run out of      milk and have the genetically engineered version from the      local gas station's quick-market, I cringe when the      children fill their cereal bowls. I just don't feel good      about it.    </p>    <p>      We can each do our part by being a good food citizen: by      caring about what happens to the source from which our food      comes and by choosing food that has been raised with      fairness to all people and sentient beings.    </p>    <p>      <em>Excerpted from The Eco-foods Guide by Cynthia Barstow,      item no. 1695 on MOTHER'S Bookshelf [to order call (866)      803-7096].
