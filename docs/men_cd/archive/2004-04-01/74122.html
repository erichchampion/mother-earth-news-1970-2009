    <p>
                        <p>      Fifteen years after Great Britain began destroying 3.7      million cattle because of an epidemic of mad cow disease,      the first U.S. case of mad cow was confirmed in December in      Washington state. The infected cow already had been      slaughtered, and its meat dispersed into the human food      supply.    </p>    <p>      Initially, the USDA reported the cow was a      "downer"-an animal too sick to walk, which is a      possible sign of mad cow infection-but subsequent      eyewitness reports have disputed that claim. Determining      the animal's status is important because downers are      targeted in the USDA's mad cow surveillance plan.    </p>    <p>      Mad cow (also called BSE or bovine spongiform      encephalopathy) is a fatal cattle disease that causes      spongelike holes in the brain, making the infected animal      stagger-thus the descriptive term "mad" cow.      Scientists think animals develop the disease by eating feed      containing brains, spinal cords or central nervous system      tissues of other infected animals. (Yes, our industrial      food system has been feeding cattle parts back to cattle!      For more on this topic, see "Cattle Futures," Page 24.)    </p>    <p>      The human form of this disease is called variant      Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD), and relatively few people      are thought to have been infected by eating nervous-system      tissue from diseased cattle. Mad cow and vCJD are caused by      prions, infectious protein particles that cannot be      destroyed by cooking. According to the USDA, the risk of      humans contracting the disease by eating U.S. beef is      extremely low, but consumer groups say the agency is not      doing enough to protect the public. The Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention so far confirm 153 cases of vCJD      worldwide, with 143 of those in the United Kingdom.    </p>    <p>      Since the outbreak of mad cow disease in the 1980s in      Europe, consumer groups have urged the USDA to adopt      stringent testing and tracking rules for beef. But, the      beef industry resisted. A week after the U.S. mad cow case      was confirmed, the USDA finally announced it would      implement a national identification system to track meat,      and ban downer cattle and mechanically separated meat from      the human food supply. Beef producers also must follow new,      more-stringent guidelines when using Advanced Meat Recovery      (AMR) systems. AMR systems strip meat dose to the spinal      cord and increase the odds that BSE-infected      central-nervous tissue could enter the human food supply.    </p>    <p>      Three-quarters of processing plants that use AMR systems      produce meat containing spinal-cord tissue, a 2002 USDA      study estimates. Ground-beef products such as hot dogs and      hamburger (including pizza toppings and taco fillings) are      most likely to contain stripped meat. Marrow in the bones      of muscle cuts could contain spinal cord tissue, too. Milk      and milk products are not thought to be at risk of      contamination.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Michael Greger, a physician with the Organic Consumers      Association, says the new regulations still aren't enough      to protect consumers, and the most glaring omission is the      lack of adequate BSE testing of live cattle. During the      last 14 years, he says, the USDA tested only about 57,000      cattle (every year, 36 million cattle are slaughtered in      this country). "We're barely testing even the highest-risk      animals," he says.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Track Mad Cow Developments</strong>    </p>    <p>      USDA: www.usda.gov/BSE<br />      Organic Consumers Association:      www.organicconsumers.org/madcow.htm<br />      Center for Science in the Public Interest:      www.cspinet.org<br />      Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE):      www.factoryfarm.org    </p>    <p>      Greger also says the USDA needs to eliminate the use of      beef remnants in all livestock and pet feeds. In 1997, the      FDA banned the practice in cattle feed, but Greger says the      law is too loosely enforced and does not include other      animal feeds.    </p>    <p>      Marion Nestle, author of <em>Safe Food</em> and <em>Food      Politics,</em> and professor of nutrition and food studies      at New York University, recommends boycotting beef as a      political statement. "It's the only way to send a message      to these powerful forces," she says. "[The USDA] knew what      needed to be done and didn't do it. Consumers need to start      demanding food safety in this country."    </p>    <p>      If you do opt to eat beef, certified organic is your safest      option-federal organic standards prohibit the use of      animal byproducts in organic feeds.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Lindsey Hodel</em>    </p>    <p><strong>      Prius Paves the Way for a Hybrid Future    </strong></p>        <p>      Get behind the wheel of a 2004 Toyota Prius (shown at      right) and "you know you're not in Kansas anymore." So say      the editors of <em>Motor Trend</em> magazine, who gave      Toyota's redesigned gas/electric hybrid their "2004 Car of      the Year" award. The editors did not hesitate to grant the      Prius their prestigious award, praising it as a      comfortable, fun-to-drive car that just happens to get      spectacular fuel economy-up to 60 miles per gallon.    </p>    <p>      There are no penalties for the Prius' environmental      consciousness-that's its magic, <em>Motor Trend</em>      editors say. The Prius has swift acceleration (zero to 60      mph in 9.8 seconds), room for five passengers, numerous      conveniences standard and impressive engineering that gives      the hybrid a smooth performance barely distinguishable from      traditional gas-engine vehicles. The <em>Motor Trend</em>      editors say the 2004 Prius is the first hybrid that auto      enthusiasts can enjoy: "It provides a tantalizing preview      of a future where extreme fuel-efficiency, ultra-low      emissions and stirring performance will happily coexist in      one package."    </p>    <p>      Consumers, too, are giving the Prius fanfare. Since its      late 2003 introduction, sales have outpaced      production-at press time there were about 15,000      outstanding orders, creating a waiting list of about four      months, although increased production should catch up to      demand this spring. Toyota plans to produce 47,000 units in      2004 just to meet demand. And the improved 2004      Prius-with more power, more room and improved fuel      economy-won't cost you more than its predecessor: The      base price remains at $19,995. Plus, if you bought a hybrid      before 2004, you are eligible for a $2,000 tax deduction;      buy a hybrid this year and you are eligible for a $1,500      deduction. This benefit ends after 2005, but the Bush      administration has proposed continued and higher tax      credits for hybrids.

A deluge of hybrid      announcements has come from the auto industry in the first      half of 2004, particularly regarding trucks and SUVs.      Highlights include:    </p>    <p>•      The first luxury hybrid, the Lexus RX 400h, arrives later      this year. Lexus, a division of Toyota, estimates the      hybrid midsize SUV will get an average fuel economy of 27.6      mpg.<br /> •Toyota will release a hybrid version of its Highlander      SUV in 2005. Toyota says the seven-passenger Highlander      Hybrid will travel 600 miles on one tank of gas, with more      horsepower and quicker acceleration than its gas-engine      counterpart.<br />• In late 2004, Honda will release a hybrid      version of its best-selling Accord. It will deliver more      horsepower than the traditional Accord, while achieving the      fuel economy of a smaller compact car.<br />• Mercedes-Benz      announced a prototype of the world's first diesel/electric      hybrid, the Vision Grand Sports Tourer. The diesel engine      and electric motor combination will deliver up to 318      horsepower.<br />• Despite delays, Ford may be the first domestic      automaker to release a hybrid. Production of the hybrid      version of its Escape SUV is slated to begin in July.      <br />•General Motors plans to use hybrid technology to improve      the fuel efficiency of its trucks and SUVs by about 30      percent the world's largest automaker says that is a more      economically sound and environmentally positive strategy      than putting hybrid technology in less-expensive cars that      already have high fuel economies. The first hybrid trucks,      the GMC Siena and Chevrolet Silverado, may go on sale later      this year.    </p>    <p>      <em>-John Rockhold</em>    </p>    <p><strong>      sprouts & snippets</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Asking Questions First.</strong><br />      San Franciscans are choosing to be safe rather than sorry.      The city is the first in the United States to adopt an      environmental code based upon the Precautionary Principle      that calls for full evaluation of environmental      repercussions before a potentially hazardous project can be      pursued. According to the Environmental Working Group, San      Francisco's new policy is making the chemical industry      nervous that this common sense approach may be adopted more      widely.

Vitamin E, an antioxidant, is thought to      prevent and control chronic disease, including heart      disease. You can increase your Vitamin E intake by eating      sunflower seeds. At 14 mg per ounce, sunflower seeds pack      more Vitamin E than any other food source. A healthy      handful can provide the daily recommended amount-a      tasty 15 mg.<br />      <strong><br /></strong> <strong>Nuclear Power      Phaseout.</strong><br />      Germany, the largest industrial nation to renounce nuclear      energy, shut off a 32-year-old, 660-megawatt nuclear      reactor late last year. The move is the first step in an      agreement between the German government and the nation's      nuclear industry. In a gradual process, all 19 German      nuclear facilities, which provide one-third of Germany's      electricity, will power down by 2025. Both renewable and      fossil-fuel energy sources will compensate for the deficit.      Meanwhile, the United States, France and Japan, nations      with the most reactors, remain committed to the      controversial energy source. Power from 104 reactors      accounts for 20 percent of U.S. electricity. France relies      on 59 reactors for 77 percent of its energy, and Japan,      with 53 operating reactors, plans to build 12 more.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
