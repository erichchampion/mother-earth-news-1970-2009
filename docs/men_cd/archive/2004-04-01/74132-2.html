        To see if ticks are present, author Barbara Pleasant drags a light- colored cloth flag over a grassy area. This is a good monitoring method, but 30 minutes or more of continuous dragging is needed to reduce tick populations. Putting the cloth through a hot wash cycle followed by a hot dry cycle will kill the collected ticks.
