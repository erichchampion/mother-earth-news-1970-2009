                    <p>      Enjoy one of the sweetest and most nutritious of all      vegetables. -    </p>		<h5 id="byline">		By John Navazio		</h5>        <p>      The humble beet has provided earthy Subsistence to      cottagers and kings since prehistoric times, and many      gardeners and cooks today remain passionate about the crop      because of its easy culture, unique flavor and exceptional      nutrition.    </p>    <p>      Baby leaves of beets make a scrumptious addition to your      salad mix soon after they sprout in spring. As winter      approaches, their hefty roots are one of the last crops to      come out of the garden, and they are easy to store through      the cold season. And amazingly, beets have twice as much      natural sugar as corn, carrots or tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      This vegetable is widely adapted to most of North America;      deep sandy or loamy soil, free of stones and with good      drainage, produces the most uniformly shaped beets.    </p>    <p>      A crop will grow best under cool, moist conditions but,      once well-established, will tolerate hot summer weather      well - as long as the soil has sufficient moisture      for even, steady growth. Beets are quite cold-hardy. They      can go into the ground during your first early spring      plantings, and the plants can remain in the garden until      after fall freezes. Beets remain undamaged even when      temperatures drop into the mid-20s.    </p>    <p>      Another convincing reason to grow beets, in contrast to      such root vegetables as carrots or potatoes, is the speed      at which they produce a crop. Within three weeks of sowing,      you can have young plants cranking out leaves for salads;      certainly within five weeks, you can harvest succulent baby      beets to cook whole for gourmet fare; and within eight      weeks (depending on the variety), you can harvest      market-sized beets and lots of leaves for steamed greens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SUPER-NUTRITIOUS CHOICE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Nutritionally speaking, beets are exceptional sources of      essential vitamins and minerals. They are rich in calcium,      iron, magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin,      vitamin A and vitamin K (see "Better Than a Multi-vitamin,"      right). Beets store most of these nutrients in their leaves      - which beet-eaters sometimes neglect - but      recent investigations into their nutritional make-up bode      well for the roots as well. Irwin Goldman, a beet      geneticist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has      shown that beet greens and beet roots are one of the best      dietary sources of folate, which is one of the B vitamins.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM THE TOPS DOWN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Beet leaves, also called "tops" or "greens" in gardening      parlance, have been highly praised for their taste and high      nutritional content since humans first cultivated this      vegetable in pre-Roman times. Goldman says that during the      time of the Romans, people selected the progenitor of the      modern beet from a wild plant in the Mediterranean region      to use as a leaf vegetable. The plant probably resembled      the Swiss chard of today, which may be a bridge crop      between the original leafy beet cultivated from the wild      and today's modern table beets.    </p>    <p>      The practice of eating fully grown beet greens as a cooked      vegetable is not nearly as widespread as it was a couple of      generations ago, but it still has devotees. Mary Ballon of      West Coast Seeds in British Columbia is a true lover of      old-fashioned cooked beet greens. "I'd grow a crop of beets      just to harvest their greens," she says. "We sometimes pull      plants as thinnings when the leaves are about 5 inches      tall, and steam the little root and the leaves all at      once." Ballon also says steamed beet greens surpass their      close relative, Swiss chard, in flavor. For beet varieties      with excellent greens for cooking, she recommends 'Early      Wonder Tall Top' and 'Lutz Greenleaf,' also called      'Winterkeeper.' (For a list of sources for the varieties      mentioned in this story, see "Beet Seed Sources," Page 94.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NEW LOOK FOR AN OLD CROP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since growers for farmer's markets and natural food stores      began selling pre-made salads in the last 10 to 15 years,      the search has been on for crops that grow quickly and      produce large quantities of succulent, tasty leaves that      don't wilt too fast. Young beet leaves turned out to be      perfect. They are juicy and tender with a piquant flavor      and have great eye-appeal: Their green leaves contrast      nicely with their red stems and leaf veins. Best when      harvested at no more than 3 1/2 inches long and 2 inches      wide, they stand up well to repeated cuts over a long      period of time.    </p>    <p>      Lots of market farmers rely on 'Red Ace' as their main beet      variety for salad mixes, as many of the traits that make it      popular with commercial growers - bright green leaves      with brilliant red stems on upright, vigorous-growing      plants - also make it a good choice for home      gardeners. Another good choice for home gardeners is      'Pronto,' which sprouts erect tops with good color and      makes a beautiful baby-style beet root for a true      dual-purpose crop.    </p>    						    <p>      If you think you don't like the taste of red beets, you      might want to try 'Golden' beets. They make an attractive      addition to the table and their flavor can be quite mild      and sweet. But, their seed often germinates poorly and      seedlings grow slowly, so if you grow 'Golden' beets, you      should plant them more thickly and give them a little more      attention throughout the season. If you want to add some      color to your salad mixes, be sure to try the `Bull's      Blood' beet, a British heirloom grown almost exclusively      for its intensely maroon-red leaves. While most beet      varieties exhibit some red pigmentation in their foliage,      'Bull's Blood' stands out for its unique, solid, blood-red      leaf color. Market farmer Eliot Coleman, author of Four      Season Harvest, has pioneered the use of cold-hardy crops      to produce vegetables in cold frames and walk-in tunnel      greenhouses throughout the winter at his Four Season Farm      in Harborside, Maine. He has found 'Bull's Blood' to be one      of the most cold-hardy of his crops.    </p>		        <p>      Coleman says he loves `Bull's Blood' for two reasons.      First, he praises the color it adds to the salad mix he      sells. "It has the most magnificent deep-maroon color that      I've ever seen," he says, "and can survive and produce in      unheated cold frames and walk-in tunnel greenhouses      throughout the harsh Maine winters." It survives when the      weather dips well below freezing, and when temperatures      climb above freezing, `Bull's Blood' is among the first      crops to produce. "As long as it stays above 32 degrees, it      produces enough to allow us to harvest every three weeks,"      Coleman says.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CULTIVATING BEETS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Growing beets successfully depends on following a few      simple rules. Firstly, sow beets as soon as spring weather      becomes "settled" in your area. Home gardeners should plant      12 to 15 seeds per foot. Thin to about one plant every 2 to      3 inches after all of the seedlings emerge. Even if your      beet plants seem like they're a little crowded as they      grow, don't worry-they will push each other apart in      the row as their roots expand in size. Diseases aren't      usually a problem in the home garden, but to help prevent      them, plant your beets in an airy, exposed section of your      garden with lots of well-aged compost worked into the soil.      At harvest, pull beets on a dry day and cut off the tops      near the crown. Don't wash or rinse off the roots. Put them      into a plastic bag with a number of small holes, and put      these in a cold root cellar or in the crisper of the      refrigerator. You'll be amazed at how long they'll last!    </p>    <p>      One of the secrets of growing great-tasting beets is to      choose a naturally sweet variety and subject it to as      little water stress as possible. Beets grown with uneven      watering may become stronger flavored and almost bitter,      and can develop white rings in the flesh. Geosmin, a      naturally occurring flavor compound in beets, gives the      vegetable its characteristic flavor. Geosmin is more      prominent in some varieties and can become more noticeable      after a beet crop is environmentally stressed. Food      scientists at Washington State University say beet      varieties that get high marks for flavor have a good      sugar/geosmin balance and better-than-average stress      tolerance.    </p>    <p>      Gardeners who take beets seriously always name the same      favorite varieties: 'Red Ace,' `Chioggia' and Lutz      Greenleaf' get the most praise for pure eating pleasure.      Steve Bellavia, trial manager at Johnny's Selected Seeds in      Maine, is especially fond of 'Red Ace.' He says, `It's our      all-around favorite. It's flavorful, productive, dependable      and attractive."    </p>    <p>      Many gardeners also grow the Italian heirloom 'Chioggia'      for the beautiful bull's-eye circular pattern in its flesh      (see photo, Page 92). Its flavor is mild and quite sweet,      making it especially popular at farmer's markets -      people who try it for its exceptional looks keep coming      back for more once they've tasted it.    </p>    <p>      'Lutz Greenleaf' is truly unique in appearance: It has      heart-shaped roots and large green leaves with little or no      red coloring. Not only does Lutz Greenleaf' win praise for      its exceptionally tender and tasty beet greens, it also s a      top choice for great-tasting roots. Steve Peters,      commercial seed manager for Seeds of Change in New Mexico      and a self-avowed beet lover, sums it up best: "'Lutz is      consistently the best-tasting beet in our trials. It has      the right balance between earthy and sweet, and a rich,      complex, satisfying flavor that lingers in your mouth well      after the initial burst of sweetness."    </p>    <p>      Whether you prefer your beets as a root vegetable, a cooked      green vegetable, or as an attractive addition to your salad      mix, it's time to explore this nutritious, delicious and      versatile crop.    </p>    <p>      <em>John Navazio, Ph.D., is the owner of Seed Movement, an      organic seed company in Port Townsend, Washington.

This flavor comes from a      compound called geosmin. Researchers are unsure whether the      beet produces geosmin, or if a microbe called an      actinomycete that lives in symbiosis with the beet in the      soil is responsible. Either way, geosmin is a natural part      of the beet experience. Without it, a beet's flavor would      be shallow and flat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Baked Beet Salad</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>4 medium-sized beets<br />      4 handfuls salad greens, such as mache spinach, lettuce,      tatsoi, mustard or baby beet leaves<br />      1/4 pound feta cheese, crumbled<br />      Vinaigrette Dressing.<br />      1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar<br />      1/2 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard<br />      4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br />      2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chervil or 1 tablespoon      tarragon<br />      Salt and freshly ground black pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      Remove the tops of the beets and set aside to use in      another dish. Wash the roots and put them in a casserole      dish with a lid. Bake at 300 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours,      or until tender. (If you are baking different-colored      beets, cook them in separate casserole dishes, or the      colors will bleed.) Remove the dish from the oven, let the      beets cool, then peel and thinly slice them into julienne.      Refrigerate until ready to use. Toss the greens with      three-quarters of the vinaigrette and arrange them on a      serving plate. Put the beets in a small bowl, pour the rest      of the dressing over them and stir to coat the beets.      Arrange the beets over the greens, and sprinkle feta cheese      over the beets. Serves 4 to 6.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
