    <p>
                        <p>      Congress ended 1986 with a flurry of activity just prior to      the elections, and many of the bills considered at the last      minute were environmental. Of greatest concern were      reauthorization of the Clean Water Act and the Superfund.      They passed Congress comfortably-in fact, the House and      Senate both unanimously approved the water bill.    </p>    <p>      But the White House wasn't quite so enthusiastic. President      Reagan did reluctantly sign the Superfund bill, which      replenishes the fund used to clean up abandoned toxic waste      dumps to the tune of $8.5 billion. He didn't like the price      tag but was persuaded by fellow Republicans that a veto      would be very costly at the polls.    </p>    <p>      But $18 billion for the Clean Water Act renewal was more      than the president could swallow. He sat on the bill until      Congress had adjourned and the elections were history. Then      he vetoed it.    </p>    <p>      Congressional sponsors reintroduced the Clean Water Act as      their first order of business when they returned in      January. Its progress bears watching.    </p>    <h3>      Other Legislation Approved in 1986    </h3>    <p>      The Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area in Oregon and      Washington, a top priority of environmental groups for more      than a decade, finally made it through.    </p>    <p>      Offshore oil leasing was banned in California until at      least 1989.    </p>    <p>      Four rivers were designated as wild and scenic: Cache la      Poudre in Colorado, Black Creek in Mississippi, Saline      Bayou in Louisiana, and the Horse pasture near MOTHER's      home in North Carolina.    </p>    <p>      The sale of 82,000 acres of oil shale bearing lands in      Colorado to three energy companies for $2.50 per acre was      temporarily banned.    </p>    <p>      Drilling for steam on the boundaries o Yellowstone, Lassen,      Mount Ranier, and other parks and public lands was      restricted until strict guarantees are in place to protect      geysers and other natural features from adverse effects.    </p>    <h3>      One State's Efforts    </h3>    <p>      California voters approved a sweeping new law aimed at      curbing chemical waste problems. It does the following:    </p>    <p>      increases fines for "midnight dumping"; requires the      governor to compile a list of chemicals "known by the state      to cause cancer"; forbids any private company with more      than 10 employees from discharging any of the chemicals on      the governor's list into fresh waters in the state;      requires these companies to notify the public of any      exposure to the chemicals and the possible consequences      (the cigarette pack warning writ large); and allows any      individual to sue any polluter suspected of violating the      discharge restrictions of the law whether he or she is      personally harmed or not-and to keep 2507o of any civil or      criminal penalties assessed against the defendant.    </p>    <p>      The law goes into effect in stages over the next year and a      half. Proponents have offered to help adapt it for use in      other states. Anyone interested in further details should      write to Carl Pope, Sierra Club, 730 Polk St., San      Francisco, CA 94109.    </p>        <h3>      Updates; Odds and Ends    </h3>    <p>      The state of Washington's Department of Ecology has      responded favorably to a request from the Sierra Club Legal      Defense Fund to regulate <em>salmon farming.</em> The DOE      has imposed a moratorium on permits for new pens and has      commissioned an extensive study of the environmental impact      of the 20-some pens now operating.    </p>    <p>      The Court of Appeals in San Francisco has upheld a ban      imposed last year on <em>placer mining in Alaskan national      parks</em> until the Park Service can come up with      regulations that will protect streams adequately.    </p>    <p>      The Park Service has issued regulations to control small      planes and helicopters that are disturbing the serenity of      the <em>Grand Canyon,</em> but environmentalists have      denounced the regs as inadequate.    </p>    <p>      The situation on the <em>D'Arbonne National Wildlife      Refuge</em> (see Econotes, issue 102) has improved somewhat      with an agreement by the gas-drilling company to keep its      equipment away from habitat needed by the endangered      red-cockaded woodpecker.    </p>        <h3>      Book of the Bi-month    </h3>    <p>      <em>The Sacred Paw: The Bear in Nature, Myth, and      Literature</em> by Paul Shepard and Barry Sanders (Viking,      1986, $17.95) is an enthralling collection of fact and myth      about the eight (yes, only eight) species of bears      worldwide. One startling assertion: In many surprising      ways, the bear is more like man than the more closely      related <em>primates</em> are. Highly recommended.    </p>    <h3>      Keep an Eye Out This Year    </h3>    <p>      Look for a widely supported bill to attack the problem of      acid rain.    </p>    <p>      The Price-Anderson Act, which limits operators' liability      in the event of a nuclear power plant accident, is up for      renewal. Antinuclear activists have long considered this to      be an Achilles' heel of the nuclear power industry.    </p>    <p>      Revision of the country's coal and onshore oil and gas      leasing laws is expected.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Tom Turner, a writer and editor who's      worked in the environmental field for 17 years, is with the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, an independent      environmental law firm that represents many organizations      across the country.
