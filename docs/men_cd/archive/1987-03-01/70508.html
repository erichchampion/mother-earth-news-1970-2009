                        <p>      The flavors of wild mushrooms speak poetry in gourmet      dishes in the world's best restaurants. You can match this      mastery in your own kitchen.    </p>    <p>      EXCERPTED FROM<em>JOE'S BOOK OF MUSHROOM COOKERY</em> BY      JACK CZARNECKI.USED WITH PERMISSION OF ANTHENEUM      PUBLISHERS.    </p>    		<p>      To mushroom fanciers, Joe's Restaurant, in Reading,      Pennsylvania, is as alluring and replete with gastronomic      promise as a morel nestled on the forest floor. Joe's is      the country's premier specialist in wild-mushroom dining;      for decades, customers and food critics have hailed it as      one of the finest and most innovative restaurants in the      nation. Here you'll encounter such delicacies as Morels      Marie (morels stuffed with pheasant mousse), Snails Suillus      pictus with a mustard and caper sauce, Crusted Beef in      Black Trumpet Sauce, and the more basic but legendary Joe's      Wild Mushroom Soup. Here, too, you'll find Jack Czarnecki,      third generation chef and proprietor of Joe's, author of      <em>Joe's Book of Mushroom Cookery,</em> and one of the      country's foremost experts on finding, preparing,      preserving, and serving fungi.    </p>    <p>      Jack's knowledge of mushrooms is a legacy from his      grandparents, who learned to gather mushrooms in Poland and      later taught their son (Jack's father) how to do the same      in the Blue Mountains near Reading. Now Jack and his entire      family-his mother and father, his wife, Heidi, and his      three children-hunt mushrooms every day during the season,      sometimes bringing back as many as 20 or 30 different kinds      for the restaurant's larder.    </p>    <p>      But Jack is quick to point out that, although identifying      and picking edible wild mushrooms is best left to those      with experience, wild-mushroom cookery can be explored by      anyone. Fresh wild mushrooms are now available (in season)      at markets in many areas...and some "wild" species such as      shiitake, oyster mushrooms, and enoki, are cultivated on      mushroom "farms." Wild mushrooms are also available canned      or dried. (Dried mushrooms are preferable to canned for      culinary purposes, says Jack, and for some species-such as      the cep-they're superior even to fresh specimens in some      recipes.) And don't judge the commercial button mushroom,      <em>Agaricus brunnescens,</em> too harshly, he says; it is,      after all, what most of us think of when we think      <em>mushroom,</em> and is perfectly acceptable for many      dishes.    </p>    <p>      In <em>Joe's Book of Mushroom Cookery</em> ($20.95,      Atheneum), Jack explains how to choose, prepare, can, and      dry mushrooms, as well as how to make everything from basic      stocks and extracts to entrees that marry mushrooms with      poultry, fish, pasta, and eggs. Here is just a sampling of      the many fine recipes to be savored from <em>Joe's Book of      Mushroom Cookery.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Braised Mushrooms    </h3>    <p>      Use this recipe for any mushrooms, domestic or wild. It is      an excellent way of preparing domestic mushrooms and is      also very good as a side dish for a main meal. But it can      also be the entree of a dinner, especially when the      mushrooms used are extra special. Serve it in shells of      puff pastry.    </p>    <p>      • 4 tablespoons melted butter<br />•  1/2 cup chopped or sliced      onions or scallions<br />•  1/2 cup water, or veal or poultry stock      <br />• 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced or whole<br />•  1 teaspoon salt<br />•  1      teaspoon sugar<br />•  1 tablespoon soy sauce<br />•  1/2 teaspoon dried      savory, or 1 tablespoon fresh chopped savory<br />•  2 tablespoons      cornstarch mixed with 1/3 cup water    </p>    <p>      Put the butter in a saucepan, and melt over low heat. Add      the onions or scallions, and sauté over medium heat      until they are almost transparent. Douse them with the      water or stock, and bring to a simmer.    </p>    <p>      Add the mushrooms, and cover the pan with a tight lid.      Reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 1/2 hour, at the      end of which they should be greatly reduced in size.    </p>    <p>      Add the salt, sugar, and soy sauce, and stir gently.      Continue to simmer for 5 minutes, then add the savory.    </p>    <p>      Thicken with the cornstarch-and-water mixture, adding a      little at time. Serve over heated pastry shells. Serves 4.    </p>     <h3>Scrambled Eggs With Mushrooms and Onions</h3>    <p>      Any kind of mushroom can be used here, but the complexity      and interest of the dish will increase with the wilder      types. The onion, that constant and faithful sidekick of      the mushroom, is again an indispensable part of this      preparation. Simply serve with toast points or croissants.    </p>    <p>      • 1/3 cup chopped onions<br />•  1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter <br />• 1      cup chopped mushrooms<br />•  1/8 teaspoon salt<br />•  1/8teaspoon sugar      <br />• 1/4 teaspoon soy sauce<br />•  8 eggs    </p>    <p>      Sauté the onions in the butter until they are just      transparent.    </p>    <p>      Add the mushrooms and the rest of the ingredients except      the eggs, and continue to cook until most of the moisture      has evaporated, about 10 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Beat the eggs lightly and add to the sauteed mixture. Stir      the mixture until the eggs are not quite completely cooked,      then take off the heat. Continue stirring the eggs until      the heat from the bottom of the pan has finished cooking      them. Offer with toast. Serves 4.    </p>    <h3> Chicken With Ceps and Pine Nuts</h3>    <p>      This is a very straightforward dish made magnificent by the      addition of <em>Boletus</em> <em>edulis</em> (ceps).      Accompany with mashed potatoes, and Cabernet Sauvignon      Blanc or any white Bordeaux.    </p>    <p>      • 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br />•  Thighs and drumsticks (separated from      each other) from two 5-pound chickens<br />•  1 medium onion,      sliced thin<br />•  2 cups water<br />•  1 ounce dried ceps <br />• 1 teaspoon      sugar<br />•  1 teaspoon salt<br />•  1 tablespoon soy sauce<br />•  1 tablespoon      cornstarch mixed with 1/3 cup water<br />•  1 small clove garlic,      crushed<br />•  1/3 cup pine nuts    </p>    <p>      Place a heavy skillet over a medium flame, and heat for 1      minute.    </p>    <p>      Add the vegetable oil, and heat for 1 minute.    </p>    <p>      When the oil is heated, add chicken pieces, and brown them      on each side for about 1 minute per side. Make sure that      the chicken is slightly browned before removing from the      pan. You may have to do this operation twice if all the      chicken pieces do not fit into the pan in the first      browning. If this becomes necessary, use more vegetable oil      as needed.    </p>    <p>      Remove chicken from pan, and place on a plate that has been      covered with a paper towel to absorb any excess fat or oil.      Reduce heat to low flame.    </p>    <p>      Drain all but 1 tablespoon of oil and fat remaining in pan.      Scrape any hardened fat or grease out of the pan, and      discard. Make sure to retain 1 tablespoon of liquid in pan.    </p>    <p>      Add onions, and sauté in the fat-oil for 1 minute.      Add water, ceps, sugar, salt, and soy sauce and bring to a      boil. Reduce quickly to a simmer, and allow to simmer for      15 minutes, uncovered. While stirring, slowly add the      cornstarch-and-water mixture to thicken. Add crushed garlic      and pine nuts. Add chicken, and resume simmering. Cover,      and let simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes, or until the      chicken is done. Stir occasionally to prevent any of the      solids from sticking to the skillet. Remove chicken from      skillet, place on a serving dish, and cover with the ceps      and remaining liquid. Correct for salt if necessary. Serves      4.    </p>    <h3>Wild Rice With Chanterelles and Apricots</h3>    <p>      This side dish goes best with game birds. It can also be      used to stuff small birds like quail. Just be sure to close      the open end of the bird.    </p>    <p>      • 1 cup raw wild rice<br />•  Water to cover<br />•  3 cups water<br />•  1 teaspoon      salt<br />•  1/3 cup chopped onions<br />•  3 tablespoons butter<br />•  1 1/2 cups      fresh chanterelles, sliced,<br />•  or 1/2 cup canned chanterelles,      drained and sliced<br />•  2 tablespoons chopped dried apricots <br />• 1/2      teaspoon salt    </p>    <p>      Wash the rice, then cover with water; soak for 30 minutes.      Drain off water, and rinse in cold water.    </p>    <p>      Bring the 3 cups water, salt, and butter to boil in a      saucepan. Add rice. Cover and cook until rice grains are      just tender, about 30 minutes. Pour off water. Keep rice      warm.    </p>    <p>      When rice is about half-cooked, sauté the onions in      2 tablespoons of butter, until they just turn transparent.    </p>    <p>      Add the chanterelles and apricots, and continue to      sauté for another 2 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Add the salt and the remaining butter, and stir-fry for 1      minute.    </p>    <p>      Stir in the wild rice, and blend until the rice is warmed      and well mixed with the mushrooms and apricots. Serve with      duck or any game dish. Serves 4.    </p>     <h3>Joe's Wild Mushroom Soup</h3>     <p>      • 2 ounces dried ceps<br />•  1 1/2 quarts water<br />•  3 medium-sized      onions, chopped <br />• 1 pound beef or veal bones<br />•  2 tablespoons      sifted flour<br />•  2 tablespoons butter<br />•  Salt and pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      In a large pot, bring the mushrooms to a boil in the      water,then simmer for 1/2 hour.    </p>    <p>      Strain the liquid through cheesecloth to remove any dirt,      reserving the strained liquid. Wash and slice the      mushrooms. Puree the onions in a food processor and place      the puree in a soup pot. Add the mushroom liquid, the      mushrooms, and the meat bones, and bring to a boil. Lower      the heat, and simmer for 1 hour, covered.    </p>    <p>      Prepare a roux by combining the flour with the butter and      heating until it forms a golden brown paste.    </p>    <p>      Strain the liquid from the pot, and add enough to the pan      with the roux, stirring, until the soup has reached the      desired thickness: about that of split-pea soup. Adjust      seasoning with salt and pepper, and top each portion with      1/2 tablespoon of <em>creme fraiche.</em> Serves 4.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: To make</em> creme fraiche, <em>add 1      tablespoon yogurt to 1 cup heavy whipping cream and let      stand overnight in a warm (72°F to 85°F)      place.</em>    </p>
