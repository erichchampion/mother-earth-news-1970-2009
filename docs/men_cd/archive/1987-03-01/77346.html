We were stretching string to make      straight rows for our huge vineyard, and only the dogs were      having fun. So as long as our pets wanted to play, we      thought, why not use that to our advantage? Two of us      stood, one on either side of the field, with rolls of      string. An end was tied to a dog's collar, the person      opposite called and clapped, and in no time the row marker      was across the field, needing only to be stretched and tied      to the stakes. Even with time out for breaks and plenty of      water, we and our dogs made short work of a tedious job.    </p>    <p>      -Brad Brougher<br />      Spokane, Washington    </p>    <h3>Weed Eaters</h3>    <p>      What I wanted was green lawn. What I had was a large yard      covered with love grass, weeds, and thatch. I didn't want      to use chemical defoliants, and the thought of tilling      under all that unwanted vegetation made my back ache. So I      used what was at hand: a rooster and five chickens. I built      them a lightweight, portable, 4' X 8' covered cage, set it      up in the yard, and let them do what comes naturally. In      four or five days they ate up or scratched up all the      plants, and fertilized the area too. Then I just moved the      cage, raked smooth the soil they'd cleared, and sodded or      sprigged it with grass. After repeating the process a      number of times, I now have that green lawn, and the      chickens did almost all the work (and rewarded me with      fresh eggs as well).    </p>    <p>      -Mike Moore<br />      Harrah, Oklahoma    </p>   <h3>Sage Advice</h3>  <p>      I was once plagued with aphids and whiteflies, as many      gardeners are. Three years ago I started using sage-one      seed planted for every three tomato starts indoors, and      sage plants around the perimeter of my garden outdoors. I      haven't had an aphid or a whitefly since. I also save used      coffee grounds (I dry them first and then store them in an      old coffee can) and scatter them over my carrot and Cole      crops each spring. None of my plants are harmed by worms or      bugs, not even by the white cabbage butterflies that are      usually such pests.    </p>    <p>      -Louise Hickman<br />      Salt Lake City, Utah    </p>  <h3>Iced Boxes</h3>  <p>      Each evening I fill pint jars with my family members'      favorite fruit juices and place them in the freezer. The      next morning, a tightly capped jar goes into each lunch      box. During the day, the lunches stay cold, and I don't      need to worry about food poisoning in hot weather. Best of      all, there are nice, slushy, cool drinks to pep up my      husband and children at work and at school.    </p>    <p>      -Pam Ashburn<br />      Glencoe, Illinois    </p> <h3>Substitute Paintbrush</h3><p>      When you have a small amount of painting to do, like a      touch-up, simply clamp a piece of felt in a spring-type      clothespin. It costs very little, and you can throw it away      when you're done.    </p>    <p>      -William C. Thompson<br />      Newtonville, Massachusetts    </p> <h3>  Lights Out</h3>  <p>      I often drive with my lights on in the morning when it's      still dark or foggy. When I ar rive at my destination, it's      daylight, and many's the time I've forgotten to turn off my      headlights and have ended up with a dead battery. No more!      Now I keep a facial tissue with a hole poked in it on hand.      Every time I switch my lights on, I hang the tissue on the      light switch lever. When the reminder has done its job, I      remove it till the next time it's needed.    </p>    <p>      -May M. Richardson<br />      Blue Mounds, Wisconsin    </p>   <h3>More Help for Loose Screws</h3>  <p>      In issue 101, one of MOTHER's readers suggested using      toothpicks to reset a screw in a stripped or enlarged hole.      I have a better way. Cut a few snippets of solder and put      them into the hole. As you twist the screw back in, the      soft metal solder will squish around the threads, making a      very tight, strong repair.    </p>    <p>      -L. C. A rata<br />      Solsberry, Indiana    </p>  <h3> Post Haste</h3> <p>      I have a quick and easy way to remove wood or metal posts      from the ground. I simply shovel out a small amount of dirt      from around the post and pour water into the indentation. I      then rock the post back and forth, which allows the water      to seep down around the base, and can usually pull it      straight up and out. Sometimes I have to add more water and      repeat the rocking procedure, but, even then, it sure beats      digging way down and then prying out the post.    </p>    <p>      -Don Crutchley<br />      Erie, Colorado    </p><h3> Garden Party</h3> <p>      If the birds enjoy too much of your garden's fine fare,      it's time for you to party, too. Invite your friends, and      ask each one to bring some worn-out clothes. Provide sticks      of wood and plenty of straw, and see who can come up with      the best scarecrow. If you have lots of guests, divide them      into groups of three or four. Everyone will have a great      time, and you'll have a small militia of straw guards to      protect your garden.    </p>    <p>      -Scott and Chris Ware<br />      Memphis, Tennessee    </p>  <h3>River Bottom Lore</h3> <p>      Here on the Wabash River, we have a yearly mosquito      barbecue. Our mosquitoes are so big that just one feeds the      whole town. But we usually catch two in case we have      visitors.    </p>    <p>      If you don't believe that, here are some truthful tips from      the river bottom. Spread pieces of cucumber skin around      your house to get rid of ants. Remove mud stains from      leather shoes by rubbing them with a slice of raw potato.      Bake meat loaf in muffin tins; it will cook in a jiffy, and      the kids will love it.    </p>    <p>      -Ron Spears<br />      Williamsport, Indiana    </p> <h3> Dandelion Blossom Jelly</h3><p>      The flavor of this delicious jelly is similar to that of      buckwheat honey-what an incentive to weed! Pick 1 quart      (packed) dandelion blossoms (the earliest ones are best),      removing stems and all green parts of the flowers. Wash      well. Place in 5 cups water, bring to a boil, and boil 1      minute. Strain, reserving liquid. Add 1 package pectin to      liquid; stir and heat. When liquid boils, add 4 cups sugar.      Simmer until jelly sheets off a spoon, then skim and pour      into sterilized jars.    </p>    <p>      -Ranee Meyers<br />      Henderson, North Carolina    </p> <h3> Safe for Man and Beast</h3><p>      I'd like to pass along a tip, which I read in our      newspaper, for getting rid of fleas. I tried it and it      really works. I bought a box of laundry borax (20 Mule Team      was specified) and sprinkled it on our carpet and under our      couch and chair cushions. I worked it into the carpet with      a broom and made sure I repeated the application every time      I vacuumed. It took three or four weeks for the fleas to      disappear, but they've been gone for two years now. Our dog      no longer scratches (and neither do we), and we feel good      about not having used poisonous chemicals.    </p>    <p>      -Rhiannon Kirkeberg<br />      Miami, Florida    </p>  <h3>Do I Hear Thunder?</h3><p>      To catch fishing worms, I jump rope! After my feet pound      the ground for a few minutes, the worms come to the      surface, even in dry weather.    </p>    <p>      -Bob McKee<br />      New York, New York    </p>
