                            <h5 id="byline">By Susan Glaese and Franklin Sides</h5>                                  <p>      <strong><strong>Protect your plants from the wind, rains,      and frosts of early spring.</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      The urge to knead the soil with our hands and tools, to      coax and nurse life from the earth, has been fueled by      months spent scanning seed catalogs. We're spring's      impatient gardeners anxious to get growing.    </p>    <p>      March winds won't hear of it. They dry out transplants like      laundry on the clothesline. They chill and tear tender      stems and roots.    </p>    <p>      Then April rains drown plants, cool and compact the ground,      bruise seedlings, and wash out seedbeds.    </p>    <p>      And, in a final holding action, May frosts pass their cold      judgment on early gardening hopes. In one still night, they      fell seedlings that represent weeks of nurturing.    </p>    <p>      Spring gardening is back yard gambling: The sooner we act,      the worse our chances. But while no gardener can eliminate      bad weather, everyone can take steps, large and small, that      will greatly reduce the misfortune that foul wind, rain,      and cold bring.    </p>     <h3> The Right Site</h3>     <p>      Let's start with the biggest-and primary-decision:      where you put your garden. Location is one of the most      important factors affecting a plot's weather resistance.      Buildings, slopes, bodies of water, and surrounding      vegetation can alter weather patterns so much that you may      have several different microclimates on your property-or      even within your garden. It may actually be worthwhile to      move an existing garden if doing so would dramatically      decrease the energy you expend confronting the elements.    </p>    <p>      Consider slopes. Generally speaking, the crest of a hill is      the windiest spot on it, and both water and cold air flow      downhill and accumulate at the bottom. The hillside itself,      then, is a better location than either the top or the      bottom.    </p>    <p>      Of course, a southern slope is best. It gets more sun than      most and is protected from cold north winds. A westerly      exposure heats up later in the morning than a direct      southern one, thawing frozen plants more slowly and      reducing possible damage. It also reaches higher overall      temperatures than an eastern exposure-which makes an east      or southeast spot better suited to heat-sensitive plants in      summer. Since northern slopes receive the least sunlight,      many people use them to raise fruit trees; the postponed      spring there retards early blooms that might get wiped out      by a late frost.    </p>    <p>      Buildings create microclimates of their own. The south side      of a home offers shelter from north winds, absorbs solar      energy during the day, and slowly releases that warmth at      night. So a permanent bed along the south wall is a great      place for your earliest starts.    </p>    <p>      Lakes and ponds reflect heat and light to plants grown      nearby, but they also allow an unobstructed pathway for      winds.    </p>    <h3>      Walls and Fences    </h3>    <p>      Once you've picked the best site, consider building fences      to provide protection from the wind-an idea so old that the      very word <em>garden</em> comes from the Middle English      <em>gardin,</em> or "enclosure." Remember: Wind increases      cold damage (and dehydration in dry weather) as well as      inflicting direct punishment. Reducing its effects is      essential to early-season growing.    </p>    <p>      Use a fence with slats or an open weave-such as a      picket, panel, woven wattle, or bamboo fence (even burlap      stretched over chicken wire). It'll allow some airflow and      provide better wind protection than a solid wall. (An      unbroken barrier creates extra turbulence in its wake-see      Fig. 1-while a somewhat permeable one slows wind speed      without creating extra currents.) A density of 50°70 is      ideal.    </p>    <h3>      Living Curtains    </h3>    <p>      <em>Shelterbelts</em> consist of one or more rows of trees      and shrubs arranged to offer wind protection, while tightly      grown walls of shrubs alone are known as      <em>hedgerows.</em> Both these "living curtains" (a literal      translation of the Japanese term for hedgerows) offer      erosion control, privacy, snowdrift protection, wildlife      habitat, food, bee forage, and ornamental value, but their      chief value is wind shelter.    </p>    <p>      A shelterbelt of trees should be perpendicular to the      prevailing winds. In most areas, this would mean along the      north and west borders. You may have different needs-for      instance, you may want protection from hot southern summer      winds. Whatever, be careful not to situate a windbreak      <em>below</em> a sloping garden, or you'll trap a pocket of      cold air that would normally move on by.    </p>    <p>      Two or three rows of trees should make an adequate-and      still somewhat permeable-shelterbelt (Fig. 2).      Evergreens are the most popular choices, since they provide      year-round protection, but deciduous trees lose only      40°70 of their effectiveness when bare. Plant shrubs on      the windward (upwind) side to protect young trees and to      fill in the gaps below mature ones.    </p>    <p>      You might want to plant deciduous trees on the windward      side of your evergreens. They generally mature faster and      can be cut for lumber or firewood once the evergreens grow      up. Windbreak trees should be planted fairly close together      so the branches will just touch when mature to form a      living canopy. Evergreens are commonly spaced from five to      15 feet apart, deciduous trees from five to 20 feet-but you      can plant them more closely at first and thin them as they      grow. (Your local soil conservation service or county      extension agent should be able to give you specific species      and spacing information for your area and soil type.)    </p>    <p>      Many shrubs provide beauty or food as well as shelter. Some      good choices are <em>Rosa rugosa</em> (rose hips),      high-bush cranberry, eastern sand cherry, lilac, Russian      olive, autumn olive, filberts, holly, tree honeysuckle,      forsythia, and rose of Sharon.    </p>    <h3>      Diverting Run-off    </h3>    <p>      Once you've done all you can to <em>gardin</em> your      garden, it's time to provide internal protection. If      surface run-of from spring rains washes into your plot, dig      a horseshoe-shaped or three-sided moat around the top and      sides. Notice we said moat, not ditch. A narrow, steep      ditch would deepen with time, washing much of its own soil      away. A moat, on the other hand, is a wide trench with a      gradual slope on its uphill (outer) side and a sharper one      on the garden side (Fig. 3). When planted with a thick sod,      this moat will resist its own erosion as well as protect      your garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Raised beds incorporate elements of both      landscaping and gardening and are favored by MOTHER'S      staff.</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Suppose your problem isn't surface runoff, but groundwater      that turns part of your plot swampy during wet spells. In      this case, you'll have to dig a trench, one foot wide and      two to three feet deep, running from the morass to an area      out below your plot. (If you have more than one wet spot,      you can build a series of trenches that run into a main one      like tributaries feeding into a river.) Put five inches of      clean three-quarter-inch gravel in the trench. Lay a      four-inch-diameter drainpipe (capped at its top) on this      and cover with soil. The drainpipe can consist of either      sections of unglazed clay tiles or corrugated black plastic      pipe with precut drain slots.    </p>    <p>      If your trench-drained water doesn't flow into a natural      waterway, you should build a sump: a four-foot by four-foot      pit that's three feet deep (Fig. 4). Line its bottom with a      one-foot layer of fist-sized stones or brick pieces. Then      give it another foot of clean three-quarter-inch gravel,      and cover the area with topsoil.    </p>    <h3>      Terracing    </h3>    <p>      The basis of many ancient agricultural systems (and still      in wide use today), terracing is the art of constructing      strips of growing area that run horizontally along a slope,      contoured to the natural curve of the :e land. Terraces      make it possible to garden on a slope -even a very steep      one-with little danger of erosion. The heat stored by the      terrace wall above each strip can also provide some thermal      protection for the crops below.    </p>    <p>      Permanent walls of stone (the best heat retainer), timber,      or (if the slope is gradual enough) sod banks are all good      for terraces. In all cases, never leave any of the garden      soil bare and exposed to erosion. Replant or mulch an area      as soon as it is harvested, grow cover crops in the      off=seasons, and mulch between widely spaced plants.    </p>    <h3>      Raised Beds    </h3>    <p>      As our listing of weatherproofing methods moves from large      scale to small, it also moves from landscaping techniques      to gardening methods. Raised beds incorporate elements of      both. The long, three- to four-foot-wide mounds warm more      quickly and drain better than flat garden soil. If you use      the close plant spacing most often recommended for raised      beds-planting on hexagonal centers rather than in      straight rows-much less of your garden space will be wasted      on erodible pathways. The plants themselves will also form      a continuous canopy of leaves as they mature, and this      "living mulch" will hold warmth close to the soil surface,      help block wind erosion, and buffer rainfall.    </p>    <p>      You'll be better off if you prepare your early-spring      growing beds the previous fall.    </p>    <p>      That way you won't have to wait for the soil to dry out      when mud month rolls around, but can plant when you like.      (We know this advice comes too late to help this spring,      but next time around...)    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>It's easier to protect an entire bed than      to shelter individual plants.</strong></strong>    </p>        <h3>      Mulch    </h3>    <p>      A thick layer of mulch-straw, leaves, wood chips, or other      dead plant material laid on your garden-will definitely      protect your plot from rain-caused erosion. But this      insulating layer can also keep your soil from warming up      quickly as well, so don't mulch heavily where you want to      grow super-early spring crops. Still, a light mulch over a      seedbed will cushion the scattering force of pounding      raindrops, and a medium-depth mulch can prevent soil      splatter on seedlings.    </p>    <h3>      Cover Cropping    </h3>    <p>      Cover cropping-growing plants to cover idle soil-sharply      reduces wind and water damage. It also improves soil tilth,      increases organic matter in your plot, and helps the soil      retain nutrients. Hardy, fall-planted species such as hairy      vetch, winter rye, and fava beans will help spring plots      the most. Such cover crops can even help dry an      early-season garden by drawing excess moisture out of the      ground. (For more information, see "Green Manure Crops" by      John Jeavons and Bill Bruneau, MOTHER No. 101.)    </p>    <h3>      Individual Plant Protectors    </h3>    <p>      Once you've done all you can to make your entire plot less      vulnerable to nature's attacks, you can turn your attention      to protecting individual plants or beds. The portable aids      we'll talk about here all buffer wind, cold, and rain well      enough to make a significant difference in how well your      crops weather bad weather.    </p>    <p>      The highly successful French market gardeners of the early      twentieth century used bell-shaped glass jars called      <em>cloches</em> (the French word for "bell") to protect      their early crops. Nowadays, most people use plastic milk      jugs for the job. Just cut off the containers' bottoms and      put one over each plant you want to shelter. The miniature      hothouses are free, durable, and-equally important-easy to      ventilate on sunny days (just unscrew the cap). If you live      in a windy area, be sure to tie them to stakes.    </p>    <p>      You can also buy or construct cone-shaped plant protectors      made of plastic or fiberglass. One such product, the Wall      0' Water, has 18-inch-high, water-filled walls that absorb      heat by day and release it at night. Old black tires can be      used to shelter and warm seedlings-they work best with      space-hungry vining crops like tomatoes and squash. And if      you grow your tomato plants in welded wire cages, you can      wrap those supports with clear polyethylene during the      fickle-weather weeks. Anchor them well with stakes. You can      also add fiberglass or scrap-wood "lids," but remember to      remove them on warm days to avoid overheating.    </p>    <h3>      Bed Protectors    </h3>    <p>      Many times it's easier to protect an entire garden bed than      to shelter individual plants. While you can make whole-bed      cloches out of glass plates or old windowpanes, such      structures are heavy and fragile. Portable garden tents are      now available that use lightweight polyethylene or      fiberglass sheeting. (Or build your own: Just make a      framework out of wood or PVC, and cover it.)    </p>    <p>      You can also take a large piece of fiberglass sheeting,      bend it into an inverted U, and secure its shape by placing      wire crosspieces across the bottom. (Cover the ends with      scrap fiberglass or plywood.)    </p>    <p>      All these bed protectors are wide enough to cover a garden      bed, but they're not very long. Tunnel cloches made of six-      or eight-mil polyethylene laid over a series of hoops (Fig.      5) can easily be made any length you'd ever need. Make the      support frames from eight- or nine-gauge wire, PVC (set on      rebar stakes), reinforced wire mesh, spring steel, and even      smooth, supple branches. For the covering, use hardware      store polyethylene -or special pre-slit poly for better      ventilation. Weight the material carefully at the sides and      ends with soil, rocks, or lumber, and be sure to open it up      as often as necessary to prevent overheating and      dampness-induced plant diseases.    </p>    <p>      Since plastic is not a good insulator, tunnel cloches offer      only a few degrees of <em>direct</em> frost protection.      (You might want to throw some blankets over your cloche on      extremely chilly nights.) But they block wind chilling and      dehydration and-most especially help warm the earth. This      increases microorganism activity and nutrient availability,      as well as helping plants get through cold spells. The      cloches fend of invading birds and insects, too. And the      poly can be replaced by a shading material in summer to      cool heat sensitive crops.    </p>    <p>      There are other ways to warm spring soil, as well. You can      lay black plastic on a bed and poke holes in it for      individual transplants. (That mulch will eliminate a lot of      weeding problems, too.) You can even try "polarization":      covering a future bed with clear plastic for a few weeks.      (Seal the edges tightly.) Tests have shown that this      dramatically prewarms soil and even kills some young weeds,      yet does not damage most beneficial soil microorganisms.    </p>    <p>      The newest space-age bed cover is spunbond polyester or      polypropylene. (Reemay is a popular brand.) Light and rain      easily penetrate this white, porous fabric. And it's so      lightweight it can be laid loosely right on top of the      plants it protects (the ends and sides weighted in place by      soil) and then get pushed up by the crops as they grow      (Fig. 6). Like plastic, the "floating bed cover" doesn't      provide much direct frost protection. But the enhanced,      sheltered environment it creates can extend either end of      the gardening season by a few weeks.    </p>    <p>      Since the material breathes well, you don't need to      ventilate the bed often. And spunbond covers make excellent      insect barriers. (Want to be sure those flea beetles don't      get on your eggplants?) Indeed, some gardeners use the      materials solely for this purpose. On the negative side,      you can't weed under a floating bed cover-you have to take      it off. You also need to remove it when plants need wind-      or insect-pollination.    </p>    <p>      The creative grower will experiment with all these      garden-protecting tactics, or better yet, combine them.      Cover a bed with both spunbond material and a poly tunnel      cloche to get double frost protection. Lay black plastic as      a mulch under your spunbond cover to eliminate that weeding      problem. Put both black plastic and old tires out on your      pumpkin patch and you can start long-season vines weeks      earlier than normal. Build a tunnel cloche against a stone      terraced bed, and trap the heat those rocks give off.    </p>    <p>      Change the Odds    </p>    <p>      You can't make your garden invulnerable to the assaults of      spring storms, gales, and frosts, but you'll be pleased by      how well the plot-protecting tactics we've mentioned do      work. Let's put it this way: Springtime gardening will      always be a gamble-who would really want it any other      way?-but you don't have to just set out your plants and      take your chances.    </p>    <p>      You can tilt the odds in your garden's favor.    </p>    <h3>      SOURCES    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Spunbond Row Cover</strong><br />      Gardeners Supply Co.<br />      Johnny's Selected Seeds<br />      Mellinger's<br />      Natural Gardening Research Center<br />      Pinetree Garden Seeds    </p>    <p>      <strong>Polyethylene</strong><br />      A.M.
