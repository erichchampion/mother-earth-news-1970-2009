                		   <h3>  A beginners guide to the book of fungi.<br />      Excerpted from the book by Sara Ann Friedman.</h3>   	<p>Once I was standing at the base of a giant redwood in    northern California. Huge branches, larger than whole trees    in my eastern woods of birches and maples, crisscrossed in    intersecting webs. There was no sky above, only more redwoods    and the secrets of a thousand years.		</p>    <p>      Fleeting shadows, footsteps, and whispers broke the mood.      Were they the murmurs of hidden forest creatures? The      shadows turned into substance, the whispers into loud human      voices. "Anything yet?" called one. "Over here," another      answered. There must have been 15 or more of them circling      the trees, their eyes fixed on the forest floor.    </p>    <p>      A shaft of sunlight filtered through the tops of the trees      and disappeared among the highest branches. <em>Look up!      Look up!</em> I w anted to shout, but to my bafflement they      were all on their knees, filling their paper bags and      baskets with large, white mushrooms. I could not help but      laugh to myself at the sight of these frenzied      foragers-a group of local mushroom hunters out in the      woods on a single-minded search-who could not see the      forest for the fungi.    </p>    <p>      Today my laugh would be touched with irony, for in the      years since then I have become one of them, a mushroom      zealot. My search for these fleshy fungi has taken me to      the steep slopes of the Rockies, where I never looked up to      see a snowcapped peak. And I am glad to have once seen the      redwoods, for I now know that when I return, it will be on      my hands and knees, nose to the ground.    </p>    <p>      There are thousands of species of mushrooms in North      America, many of which have very strange shapes and don't      look anything like mushrooms at all. Resembling heads of      cauliflower or coral, slabs of beefsteak, soccer balls,      turkey tails, or icicles, they hang, protrude, and billow      from tree trunks, leaf mold, dead logs, and stumps. (They      also grow on bathroom floors, dead bodies, in woodpecker      holes, and on other mushrooms.) Mushrooms have fanciful      folk names like "witch's butter," "shaggy mane," and      "bear's head." Some turn blue or red when they are bruised;      others glow in the dark. (A World War I soldier wrote home      to his wife, "I am writing to you by the light of five      mushrooms.") Many mushrooms are wonderful to eat; others      are toxic enough to cause serious, if temporary,      discomfort. Most are simply unpalatable, tasteless, or too      tough to eat. A few are deadly.    </p>    <p>      Fungi inhabit every nook and cranny of the living world. By      releasing an enzyme, they break down and absorb organic      material into their own tissue. As a parasite the fungal      mycelium attacks living trees or tree wounds as well as      tissue in flowers, stems, leaves, and roots. One-celled      parasitic fungi cause corn smut, chestnut blight, Dutch elm      disease, and wheat rust. Some fungi are saprophytes (the      Greek word for "rotten"), nourishing themselves on the      tissue of dead and decaying wood, leaves, conifer needles,      dung, bones, and feathers.    </p>    <p>      As I ventured into this new kingdom, I began to see how      intricate and complex the world of fungi is, and how      intertwined with our own. Without them, we'd be up to our      eyeballs in fallen trees. Decomposing bark, leaves, and      twigs, fungi clear the fields and forests of nature's      clutter and turn decaying matter into nutrient-rich humus.      Efficient waste disposers and major manufacturers of      organic fertilizer, their success has not yet even been      approached by the greatest human efforts.    </p>    <p>      Not alone in my devotion to mushrooms, I am part of a small      but growing population of loyal subjects. There are      thousands of us in North America and many more in Europe,      where the gathering of mushrooms dates back to ancient      times and has always been a family ritual.    </p>    <p>      It is difficult to explain why these fungal fruits draw us      into the woods, tempting us to forget time, ourselves, and      our families. Looking for wild mushrooms allows us to      satisfy without dire consequences those childhood urges      that we are encouraged to bury. It allows us to get dirty.      It gratifies our urge to steal. Crawling furtively through      the woods, guarding our secret places, we fulfill our      primal, competitive, and territorial drives. The search for      mushrooms expands our world and leads us down new paths of      knowledge, connections, and pleasure. Finding them allows      us to retreat into private obsession. Anyone who has      climbed the Himalayas or collected baseball cards,      butterflies, or Mayan vases knows what it means to search      for wild mushrooms.    </p>   <h3> Introduction to the Field</h3>    <p>      For some, identifying mushrooms turns out to be a far more      challenging activity than finding them, and far more      rewarding than eating them. It exercises the mind and      creates the pleasant illusion that the world would be a      manageable place if only we could put the right label on      everything. To the newcomer, many mushrooms are      indistinguishable, like so many ducks on a pond. But as you      learn to tell a mallard from a decoy, you learn to tell a      <em>Russula</em> from a stinkhorn. All you need is a sharp      eye, a delicate touch, and a strong nose.    </p>    <p>      A mushroom will willingly answer a lot of your questions,      but first you need to know what to ask: Where and how is it      growing? On a log or on a tree? In a grassy meadow, under      the leaves, or in the bathroom shower? Some mushrooms grow      singly or in scattered groups; others grow in clusters, all      attached to a single base. When you dig up a mushroom, be      sure to get it all out and to examine the base: Is it      straight or is it bulbous? Does it have a sac? When you      turn mushrooms over, you will see that many have gills      underneath the cap, while others have pores, teeth, or      coral branches. Colors vary in tone and intensity.      Mushrooms come in all shades of almost any color you can      think of. Sometimes, but not always, color is a key to the      mushroom's identity.    </p>    <p>      Feel the mushroom: Is it rough and leathery, fleshy, or      fragile? Does it have a stem? Is the cap smooth, hairy, or      downright slimy?    </p>    <p>      You can also use your sense of smell. Mushrooms give off an      amazing variety of odors, resembling everything from nectar      to burnt rubber. Like fingerprints, these characteristics      of mushrooms are clues to proper identification.    </p>    <p>      If you want to learn more than a handful of species, a      field guide is essential. Even 20year veterans keep one in      their back pockets. There are probably 100 in English      alone, ranging from small local and regional guides to      books that cover North America. Some are illustrated with      lush colored plates; others rely on a clear, precise text      and limit themselves to black and white drawings or      photographs. Some are universally respected; others are      totally useless. <em>[Editor's Note: See the sidebar for a      list of recommended field guides.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Apart from buying books, mushroom hunting is not an      expensive activity. All you need is a basket, a box of wax      paper or some wax paper bags, a knife, a 1OX hand lens, a      compass, insect repellent, index cards, lunch, and of      course your favorite field guide. Pick fresh specimens, and      try to find them at different stages of development. On one      side of an index card, note the habitat (lawn, log, tree,      kind of tree if you know it, and so on). On the other side,      when you get home, you will want to place a cap gill-side      down, cover it with a glass, and take a spore print. Spore      color is very important in the identification of most      gilled mushrooms. And remember to wrap each species      separately in wax paper. Sometimes you might want to stop      and actually use your field guide in the field. Ideally,      this patient and efficient style of collecting will make      your task of sorting and identifying much easier.    </p>    <p>      I know of few collectors who follow their own advice,      however, and more often than not I find myself forgetting      everything but lunch.    </p>    <h3>The Gilled Mushrooms</h3>   <p>      These are what most of us picture when we say the word      mushroom. They have a stalk and a rounded cap with gills      underneath. Spores develop on these bladelike gills, which      radiate from the stalk to the edge of the cap.    </p>    <p>      Gilled mushrooms come in a dazzling variety of sizes and      colors and an infinite variety of characteristics that are      clues to their identification: central and of center      stalks; gills that are close, distant, smooth, or serrated;      caps that are velvety, slimy, scaly, or fuzzy; spore colors      that are white, pink, brown, or purple-black. Some grow on      the ground; others grow on wood. Some grow singly; others      grow scattered or in clusters. Most of the mushrooms found      in woods and on lawns are gilled. They include some of the      best common edibles (the honeys, blewits, parasols, and      meadow mushrooms) as well as some of the deadliest killers      (the Amanitae and Galerinae).    </p>    <h3>Boletes</h3>    <p>      With over 200 species in North America, this large family      of mushrooms, Boletaceae, is easy to recognize. Boletes      often resemble gilled mushrooms from the top, but when you      turn them over, you will notice a spongy bottom or pored      surface instead, which may be white, gray, yellow, orange,      red, or brown.    </p>    <p>      Boletes grow in mycorrhizal, or symbiotic, association with      the roots of many trees, and some grow under only one kind      of tree such as ash, white pine, or larch. By noticing      this, you can learn about both trees and mushrooms. Many      boletes will turn blue when they are bruised.    </p>     <h3>Corals</h3>    <p>      Many members of this mushroom family, Clavariaceae, truly      resemble underwater coral. They usually come club-shaped or      branched and in many bright colors, from white to yellow,      pink, orange-red, amethyst. Sometimes they will cover the      ground in late summer or fall, particularly favoring      conifer woods. Others resemble cauliflower or heads of      lettuce. Most coral mushrooms are edible. A few, like      Sparassis crispa and Sparassis radicata, are choice.    </p>     <h3>Cup Fungi</h3>    <p>      Turning over a rotten log on a wet spring day will often      reveal a tiny orange or scarlet mushroom shaped like a cup.      Appropriately named cup fungi, these brightly colored      species are part of a class, consisting of many families      and orders, called Discomycetes, which contains all the      fungi resembling cups or saucers, spoons, sponges, saddles,      brains, tongues, urns, or fans including the highly      esteemed morel and truffle.    </p>    <h3> Polypores</h3>     <p>      Even on dry days and in the dead of winter, these mushrooms      will cover trees and stumps with fungal shelves. Polypore      means "many pores." If you turn over one of the mushrooms      in this very large and diverse group, you will see tiny      holes-hexagonal, round, or mazelike-under the cap.    </p>    <p>      Some polypores are edible and delicious. Many are tough and      leathery. They can be virulent parasites on living trees,      or they can serve an important function as saprophytes      helping to decay dead wood.    </p>    <p>      In many cultures and for many centuries, certain polypores      have been used as tinderboxes, perfumes, dyes, and as      medicines and tonics.    </p>     <h3>Puffballs and Earthstars</h3>     <p>      One of the most common groups of I mushrooms, puffballs      grow throughout the summer and fall in all parts of the      country, in grassy areas and on logs. Sometimes they are      large, round, and white like a soccer ball; other times      they grow like small prickly pears in dense clusters.      Puffballs and earthstars are of the class Gasteromycetes, a      word that means "stomach mushroom"; their spores mature      while completely enclosed in and protected by a surrounding      "skin."    </p>    <p>      Earthstars, which like puffballs are members of the order      Lycoperdales, are small fungi that resemble flying saucers.      They are shaped like a ball when young; then the surface      splits open, releasing the spores through the top, and the      pieces curve back, forming four or more arms that resemble      a star. Growing mostly in sandy soil, earthstars are      distributed throughout North America.    </p>    <h3> Stinkhorns</h3>     <p>      Your nose will probably lead you to these strong-smelling      mushrooms before you ever catch sight of them. But when you      do, you will discover some of the most colorful, oddly      shaped fungi in the forest. The stinkhorns, which are of      the order Phallales, have evolved a unique means of spore      dispersal. The spores are embedded in a slimy, green      substance that smells of decaying flesh. The . odor draws      flies and other insects, which remove the slime-and also      the spores-with their feet. Stinkhorns first appear as eggs      that resemble puffballs or Amanita eggs. As it matures, the      egg opens by expansion from within, and fanciful shapes      develop. Stinkhorns are exotic and erotic, largely southern      in their habitat.    </p>     <h3>Tooth Fungi</h3>    <p>      It may seem like Christmas in September when you are in the      woods and walk smack into a tree decorated with large      clusters of glistening white icicles. But the tree is more      likely to be an oak, maple, or beech than a fir or spruce,      and the cluster of icicles is a mushroom called      <em>Hericium.</em>    </p>    <p>      Members of a large family of mushrooms called Hydnaceae,      the genera <em>Hericium, Dentinum,</em> and <em>Hydnum</em>      produce their spores on long spines or teeth that hang down      toward the ground. Although not as common as boletes and      polypores, these tooth fungi are just as easy to recognize.      Some, like the <em>Hericium,</em> grow on logs, stumps, and      living trees, and thus they are noticeable from a distance.      The smaller <em>Dentinum</em> often grows on the ground      with caps of many colors. Although none of the tooth fungi      are known to be poisonous, many are too tough and bitter to      eat. Several species of <em>Hericium</em> and      <em>Dentinum</em> are edible and choice.    </p>   <h3> Introduction to Edibles</h3>    <p>      For many Americans, hunting and eating wild mushrooms seems      a risky business. For the rest of us, it is challenging,      frustrating, and time-consuming, but the rewards are many,      and by following a few simple rules the risks can be      reduced to almost zero.    </p>    <p>      <em>1. Eat only those mushrooms you can positively identify      (as edible, of course).</em> There is no way to tell a      poisonous species from an edible one except to learn them      both. You should be able to learn, without much trouble, a      dozen or so easily recognizable good edibles and the small      number of deadly toxic species. Use your eyes, your field      guides, and other amateurs whom you trust to enhance your,      knowledge.    </p>    <p>      <em>2. Be patient, and don't cut corners.</em> Pick the      whole mushroom; identification is often determined by the      base-the part that is sometimes underground. Take a spore      print when you aren't absolutely certain. It will often.,      lead to positive identification, especially with gilled      mushrooms. Separate the edible species in your basket from      those that you know to be inedible and from those that you      can't identify, and when you get home, go through the      collection again-sometimes two similar but different      species can get mixed up in the basket.    </p>    <p>      <em>3. Even after you have positively identified a mushroom      as edible, eat only a small amount the first time.</em>      Some people have an adverse reaction to certain mushrooms;      it's usually mild but can be uncomfortable and is worth      avoiding.    </p>    <p>      <em>4. Be sure that you know the local flora where you are      hunting.</em> If you live in New York and are visiting      California, double-check your identifications. Species can      vary from region to region, and some are unique to a      particular area. A few species are toxic in one region and      harmless in another.    </p>    <p>      <em>5. Eat only firm, fresh, young mushrooms.</em> As they      age, mushrooms decay rapidly, sometimes causing toxic      reactions. They also don't taste as good.    </p>    <p>      <em>6. Cut into mushrooms to check them for insect holes      and other evidence of living creatures.</em> They probably      won't hurt you, but it is no more pleasant to find a grub      in your mushroom soup than it is to find half a worm in      your apple.    </p>    <p>      <em>7. To be on the safe side, cook all mushrooms      thoroughly.</em> Although some can be eaten raw without      harm, many delicious species, like the honey mushroom and      many boletes, contain toxins that are easily destroyed by      proper cooking. Several minutes of sauteing over a      medium-high flame is sufficient.    </p>    <p>      <em>8. If you drink alcohol when you taste any mushroom, do      so moderatelY--and not at all with a member of the      genus</em> Coprinus. Many field guides advise you not to      drink liquor at all when you eat wild mushrooms. A few      species, like <em>Coprinus atramentarius,</em> may cause an      unpleasant reaction if you <em>do.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>9. In the field, wrap your mushrooms in wax paper or      wax poser</em> <em>hags</em> Plastic will cause them to      decay more rapidly. To preserve them until cooking, keep      them in the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      Mushrooms are excellent assimilators, adapting to, even      enhancing, almost any culinary environment that they find      themselves in (with the possible exception of Jell-O and      chocolate ( hip cookies): scups, soufflés, stew%,      vegetable casseroles, sauces, omelettes, ragouts, pasta,      breads, and cheeses. They may also lit eaten alone as      finely chopped duxelles, of they may be sauteed, pickled,      of broiled. Many are interchangeable, and recipes often      call simply for "1/2 lb. mushrooms." Rut just as they do in      the field, wild mushrooms also defy easy categorizing in      the kitchen. In general, a more delicately flavored      mushroom will do best in a chicken, veal, or other light      dish, while stronger-tasting mushrooms can take more highly      seasoned meats and sauces.    </p>    <p>      Most mycophagists believe that mushrooms are more desirable      and tastier unwashed. You should cut and clean off most of      the dirt in the field; at home, you can wipe them with a      damp paper towel or a soft brush.    </p>    <p>      The first time you cook a mushroom, make it a one-species      sauteed dish. Half the fun in mushroom cookery is      experimenting, and this will give you the chance to      experience your find in all its glorious essence. Start      over a low flame with some butter and a small amount of oil      to prevent burning. Some species, like the chicken      mushroom, are profligate butter soakers. They soon begin to      dry out, and the butter keeps disappearing no matter how      much you add. These mushrooms need a very low, slow flame      and may be best covered. Others will turn golden before      your eyes-brown if you turn away for a second-and then will      shrivel and sizzle right out of the pan. So remove them      right away-don't answer the phone while you are sauteing      mushrooms. After a while, you will become familiar with      each species' habits in frying pans, and you will decide      for yourself how much salt and pepper to use, whether to      add garlic or shallots, or dip them in sour cream, or add      them to a spaghetti sauce, or just put them on toast points      and serve them to your guests.    </p>    <p>      In the next section, I will describe some good edibles,      followed by suggestions for cooking them. Although it      should be helpful in identification, this section is not      intended to serve as a field guide. Be sure to check at      least one, better two, field guides for specific details of      description, such as habitat, spore color, and toxic      look-alikes. <em>(Editor's Note: In the book from which      this article is excerpted, the author describes in detail      no less than 20 edible mushrooms, as well as the half-dozen      North American species-all of which are gilled-known to be      severely toxic. Because of this article's space      limitations, and because distinguishing between gilled      species can be tricky, we have chosen to include only      nongilled edible species (with the exception of one; the      unmistakable shaggy mane). All are considered easily      identifiable, but keep the author's caveats in mind: Always      consult authoritative field guides, and never eat any      mushroom that you can't positively identify. Beginners      should resist the temptation to go it alone. Better to      study under the tutelage of an experienced mushroomer      first.)</em>    </p>   <h3> Edible Mushrooms</h3>        <p>      <strong><strong>King Bolete, or Cep</strong></strong>      <em>(Boletus edulis):</em> Most genera and species of      bolete that grow in this country are edible and taste good.      A few red pored or blue-staining species are toxic no      matter how you cook them, and a few others will cause      discomfort if you eat them raw or undercooked. Several      other species are distasteful <em>(Gyrodon      merulioides)</em> or tasteless; others are bitter (several      species of Tylopilus, especially <em>felleus),</em> but it      is easy enough to find these out by tasting them. A larger      problem with boletes generally is that insects and other      small creatures seem to find them as tasty as we do. There      are few things more disappointing than to come upon a dozen      large, healthy-looking boletes, only to pick them and have      them turn to mush in your hand, or to cut them open and      find a rush-hour traffic circle of larva tunnels running      right through the flesh.    </p>    <p>      For most mycophagists, there are many equally choice      boletes. By common agreement, however, there is one that      stands out as king among kings. It is <em>Boletus      edulis,</em> known also as the cep, <em>Steinpilz,      prawdziwek,</em> and by a dozen other names.    </p>    <p>      Like most other boletes, the cep grows under conifers and      deciduous trees from June through October in most parts of      the country, and in late fall through winter in California.      It is a variable mushroom with a smooth cap ranging from      red-brown to tawny to chestnut to dark brown. The flesh is      white and the pores are white when young, turning tawny      with age. The stem can be short or long and is usually      stout or bulbous. Just under the cap on the top of the stem      are white or pale-colored weblike hairs called      reticulations.    </p>    <p>      There is one major look-alike for <em>B.</em> <em>edu</em>      <em>lis,</em> and although confusion won't result in a      serious problem, it can be very frustrating. <em>Tylopilus      felleus,</em> known appropriately as the bitter bolete, is      similar in general appearance to the cep. Its cap color and      stalk shape both vary in the same way, and the mushroom has      webbing on the upper stem. But the reticulation on T.      <em>felleus</em> is dark, and the mushrooms pores are      pinkish. If you have any doubts, just take a small bite. T.      <em>felleus</em> has a disagreeable bitterness that cannot      be disguised or cooked out.    </p>    <p>      Many experienced mycophagists insist that the cep is far      better dried than fresh. The flavor, they say, is enhanced,      and the reconstituted mushroom does not have that soggy      texture common to so many fresh boletes. There are many      ways to cook boletes, but they seem to go especially well      in soup.    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>Morel</strong></strong> <em>(Morchella      esculenta</em> or <em>deliciosa): To</em> many, this      spongy-capped creature is the Moby Dick, the Holy Grail,      the El Dorado of mushrooms. Even where it is plentiful,      mushroom hunters will lie, cheat, and steal for a      mouthful-or a ton. Generous to a fault about revealing      their sites for other kinds of mushrooms, morel hunters      threaten to shoot on sight any person caught poaching on      their territory. To others, including many of us in the      eastern United States, morels are more like UFOs: We are      certain only that <em>others</em> have seen them. Back      East, we count them; in the West, they weigh them.    </p>    <p>      Morel season lasts for approximately three weeks in the      spring. These three weeks fall at different times in      different regions of the continent. They may begin as early      as March in Los Angeles and North Carolina and end as late      as June or July in Canada. Morels are found in the Rockies      as late as August. Part of the attraction of morels is the      mystery that surrounds their location. They are said to      grow in old apple orchards, under tulip poplars and near      dead elms, on banks and under hedges, under ash, walnut,      and butternut, in conifer woods, in swampy places, and in      construction sites. So where are they? With all our clues,      we find them, if at all, where and when they choose to      appear.    </p>    <p>      Morels vary in size and shape, and their colors range from      pale gold to near black. But their most distinctive      features are consistent: an egg-shaped-toconical head of      ridges and pits and a hollow cap and stem.    </p>    <p>      Beginners are always warned to look out for the      <em>Gyromitra,</em> a fleshy Ascomycete of rather dubious      reputation. Once you have seen them both, however, I      believe there is no danger of mistaking one for the other.      The cap of the <em>Gyromitra</em> is more brain-shaped than      spongy, and it is not hollow when you cut it open.    </p>    <p>      Some people prefer morels fresh, while others say that the      woodsy flavor is enhanced by drying and then rehydrating      them in water, wine, or cream. Some devotees insist that      morels are so good that they should be eaten alone, sauteed      in butter and shallots, and then served on toast points or      stuffed--with chopped morels, of course-and then baked or      broiled. Others, less purist, are perfectly satisfied      cooking morels in cream sauce and serving them with veal.    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>Chicken Mushroom</strong></strong>      <em>(Laetiporus sulphureus):</em> This fleshy, colorful      polypore is plentiful, popular, and easy to spot. Growing      on stumps, logs, and living trees, its large, overlapping      shelves of orange and yellow always remind me of giant      Halloween candy corn. The chicken mushroom, or sulphur      shelf, is a wound parasite. Its mycelium enters a tree      through an opening caused by lightning, axe, or woodpecker      and penetrates to the heartwood, releasing enzymes to      digest the cellulose, thus causing the wood to rot. It is      known to damage wooden boats and to be a major cause of dry      rot.    </p>    <p>      The sulphur shelf grows on many kinds of wood, but in the      East I have found it mostly on oak. It grows from May to      November in all parts of the country. One tree may provide      over 20 pounds. All of it <em>may</em> be edible, but the      best parts to eat are the tender young tips. The mushroom      should be moist-almost slimy, according to some      purists-when it is picked. The taste should be soft and      lemony; if it is chalky, don't eat it, no matter how      beautiful and how tempting it looks. As the mushroom ages      it toughens and is frequently distasteful. In the East this      is one of the safest edibles around, with no look-alikes.      It is rarely eaten in California, where it grows on      eucalyptus trees, or in the Pacific Northwest.    </p>    <p>      Some say the flavor of this mushroom resembles chicken; I      don't agree, although it is used often enough in recipes      calling for chicken, and it is especially tasty in stir-fry      Chinese dishes. It is good sauteed, either alone or dipped      in flour, egg, and bread crumbs. It can also be dipped in      pancake batter and deep-fried.    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>Chanterelle</strong></strong>      <em>(Cantharellus cibarius):</em> There are several choice      species of chanterelles, but it is <em>Cantharellus      cibarius</em> that is the best known and most popular.      There are few sights more tantalizing than a woodland floor      carpeted with scores of these vase-shaped, orange      mushrooms.    </p>    <p>      In beginning mushroom courses, the chanterelle is usually      presented as one of the easiest mushrooms to recognize.      Still, it has several lookalikes; one of them is poisonous,      and it does take some care to tell them apart. The      chanterelle is distinguished from its lookalikes by the      presence of blunt ridges--they are not really gills-with      forked veins running down the cap and onto the stem.    </p>    <p>      The poisonous jack-o'-lantern <em>(Omphalotus      olearius)</em> has sharp, knife-edged gills. It is a fall      rather than a summer mushroom, it grows on wood rather than      on the ground, and it grows in large clusters rather than      singly or in scattered groups. Despite these supposedly      clear differences, there are more reported poisonings in      the East resulting from confusion between these two      mushrooms than any others.    </p>    <p>      Chanterelles are firm, fleshy mushrooms with a strong,      fruity aroma that often resembles apricots. Although it is      best to cook all fresh mushrooms as soon after collecting      them as possible, chanterelles can be kept for a week if      they are well refrigerated. And although no one will      disagree about their edibility, there is little agreement      regarding how they are best cooked. Some say they      absolutely need a long, slow saute over a low fire; I have      also heard that one or two minutes over a higher flame      until the mushrooms are almost crisp is best. Some people      prefer them as a side dish, untainted by other tastes,      while others cannot think of a better way to stuff Cornish      game hens or make rice pilaf than by using chanterelles.    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>Shaggy Mane</strong></strong> <em>(Coprinus      comatus):</em> This mushroom is ethereal-looking,      exquisitely edible, easy to recognize, and anatomically      intriguing. Scores of these shaggy, white mushrooms appear      out of nowhere, like ants at a June picnic, all over lawns,      golf courses, roadsides, and other grassy areas after heavy      rains. Perfect city mushrooms, they also grow in vacant      lots, housing project lawns, parks, and dumps.    </p>    <p>      Unlike other gilled mushrooms, the <em>Coprinus</em> does      not release its spores by means of gravity. Under its      cone-cap, the gills are pressed together very tightly in a      vertical position, leaving very little space for falling      spores. The means of spore dispersal for the      <em>Coprinus</em> is called autodigestion, or      deliquescence; the gills literally dissolve into an inky      black fluid. As the gills dissolve, the spores contained in      the inky fluid drop to the ground. For this reason, many      species of <em>Coprinus</em> are called inky caps. There      are no toxic lookalikes for the shaggy mane.    </p>    <p>      The whole process of deliquescence can take place in a few      hours; it is best to catch shaggy mane and other edible      inky caps before they begin to turn black. Some suggest      taking a frying pan into the field and cooking them there.      Others have discovered that such drastic action isn't      really necessary. Placed in the refrigerator in a covered      jar of cold water, shaggy manes will stay fresh for a week.    </p>    <p>      These delicately flavored mushrooms can be cooked in a      variety of ways. In addition to being sautéed in      ghee, or clarified butter, they are delicious in a cream      sauce with scrambled eggs, veal, or chicken.    </p>        <p>      <strong><strong>Hen-of-the-Woods</strong></strong>      <em>(Grifola frondosa):</em> This smoky, gray-capped      polypore with a white pore surface resembles a mass of      ruffled feathers nesting at the base of a tree. Its small,      flat, overlapping caps fan out in clusters that often reach      a size of up to several feet. Growing at the bases of oaks      and other trees, this fall mushroom is primarily an eastern      species in the United States, unknown in California and the      Pacific Northwest. It is common in Europe and Japan, where      it is cultivated and prized.    </p>    <p>      The hen-of-the-woods has no toxic lookalikes and, except      for the spring and summer mushroom <em>Polyporus      umbellatus,</em> has no real lookalikes at all.    </p>        <p>      When cooking the mushroom, use only the tender fronds. The      base is excellent for soups and stocks only. It is a lovely      addition to chicken or veal and is excellent in casseroles.      <strong><strong>Hedgehog Mushroom</strong></strong>      <em>(Hydnum repandum):</em> This is the most common and      best known of the tooth fungi. Although, viewed from above,      its orange-to-reddish-brown cap makes it look like any      number of gilled mushrooms, the tiny, white, tooth-like      structures that it has on its underside instead of gills      are its mark of distinction.    </p>    <p>      Although there are other tooth fungi that have stems, and      most are of unknown edibility, there is no lookalike for      this orange-capped mushroom, which grows on the ground in      wooded areas, coast to coast, from July to November.    </p>    <p>      This is a good, steady edible; it is popular in Europe and      sold canned in France. Some say it is best mixed with other      mushrooms.    </p>      <h3>Magnificent Obsession</h3>    <p>      II have been hunting wild mushrooms since 1975. What began      as mild curiosity has become an obsession. I have stalked      the fleshy fungus from New York City parks and Long Island      lawns to the woods of Ohio, Texas, Oregon, Canada, and      France. Along the way I have learned to follow the flow of      a river, to name mosses and ferns, to observe the behavior      of insects, and to use a microscope. I have learned to      distinguish between deer dung and rabbit dung, not out of      any scatological interest, but because hidden among the      leaves they look like small brown mushrooms. I have      explored the myths of science and the science of myths. I      have come to know a variety of extraordinary people, and I      have come to know myself.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>Editor's Note:</em> Celebrating the Wild Mushroom,      <em>only a small portion of which is excerpted here, is      available in paperback for $10.95 and in hardcover for      $18.95 at most bookstores.
