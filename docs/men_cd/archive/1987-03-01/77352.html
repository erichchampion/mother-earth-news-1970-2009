Box 70,      Hendersonville, NC 28793. The most frequently asked      questions will be answered here-and here only-so that we      can all benefit from what these folks have to say.</em>    </p>         <h3>Acid Evergreens</h3>    <p>      I just read Susan Glaese's article on compost in MOTHER No.      101, in which she said to "go light on evergreens" when      building a compost pile. Now I'm antsy about my asparagus.    </p>    <p>      When I moved to my present home in Maine last fall, I faced      truly dreadful soil: an inch of slimy, acid red clay      resting on bedrock, all on a 30° slope. To create      growing beds, I used what I had most of-evergreen boughs,      layer upon layer of mostly white spruce, alternating with      lime and clay. Then I planted my healthy, seed-grown,      compost-fed asparagus plants on these built-up beds and      added a nitrogen fertilizer. I also planted seven fruit      trees on the same mounds.    </p>    <p>      My questions: Can I expect good results? Should I replant      this spring, adjusting the soil composition?    </p>    <p>      It sounds as if you have two major problems. The first is      that your beds sit on bedrock, which prevents your plants      from developing the deep root systems they need for optimum      growth. Asparagus crowns are usually buried eight to 12      inches deep, and fruit trees are planted even deeper,      depending on the root ball.    </p>    <p>      The second problem is the soil's pH. Heavy applications of      spruce and fir would make your acid soil even more acid,      drastically inhibiting the bacterial growth needed for      decomposition and stunting germination in many plants as      well. Asparagus and most fruit trees prefer a pH between 6      and 7; I suspect yours is lower.    </p>    <p>      I haven't seen the site, of course, but if I were you, I'd      probably start over. First, try to find a garden site      that's lacking in bedrock. Then incorporate as much      well-aged compost as you can, made from a variety of less      acid ingredients-straw, hay, manure, weeds, grass      clippings. (Or you can buy readymade compost.) Keep working      this into the soil, and over the years you will see a      difference in aeration, tilth, pH, and general health.      Third, I've found that working sharp sand into clay soil      makes a real difference. Finally, have your soil's pH      checked, and then ask your local agricultural agent how      much lime to apply for that reading.    </p>    <p>      I realize that all this sounds like an awful lot of work      and goes against the ideal of using on-site materials, but      it may be what it takes to cultivate plants that like      neutral or alkaline soil. You might also want to consider      raising acid-loving crops-such as grapes and most      berries-which are better adapted to your area.    </p>    <p>      -Susan Glaese    </p>    <p>      Susan Glaese is MOTHER's head gardener.    </p>          <h3>Lead in Home Plumbing</h3>     <p>      Three years ago, I had copper plumbing installed in my      home. The 50°70 tin-50% lead sweat solder used on the      joints puddled in the elbow fittings. Lately, with all the      negative publicity over lead in drinking water, I've become      concerned about health risks stemming from our household      water's exposure to the solder. Has there been any research      on this subject?    </p>    <p>      Lead has been identified as a toxin that can affect the      body's nervous system, its normal vitamin D metabolism, the      kidneys, and the blood-forming processes. Lead is      especially harmful to unborn and young children, and recent      evidence suggests that even minor concentrations in the      blood can have negative effects.    </p>    <p>      In light of these and other facts, amendments to the Safe      Drinking Water Act of 1974 were signed into law in June      1986. The new amendments include provisions that allow the      Environmental Protection Agency to prohibit the use of      solder or flux containing more than .2% (two-tenths      percent) lead in any public water supply system or any      building connected to a public system. They also require a      warning label to be displayed on any solder containing more      lead than the legal limit. Additionally, the lead content      of pipes and fittings used in public systems is limited to      8%. Federal mortgage insurance and assistance may be denied      to new residential property that fails to meet the current      standards.    </p>    <p>      A well-soldered sweat joint should not have an excessive      amount of solder flow beyond the point of contact, but      solder is often exposed to the water supply nonetheless.      The amount of lead that leaches from a joint depends upon      the corrosiveness of the water, the age of the plumbing      fittings, and the amount of contact time between the water      and the soldered joints.    </p>    <p>      There are several options available to those concerned over      lead-soldered plumbing. One is to replace copper sweat-fit      pipe with approved PVC and CPVC plastic plumbing. Another      is to replace the fittings and to resolder the joints with      a nonlead solder such as a tin-antimony, copper-tin, or      silver-tin blend. (These cost more than tin-lead solder and      have higher melting temperatures, but these concerns are      minor when considering the cost of a complete plumbing      system.) Finally, it may be possible to control lead      contamination through the use of water treatment and      corrosion-inhibiting equipment.    </p>    <p>      -Richard Freudenberger    </p>    <p>      <em>Richard Freudenberger is an associate editor and      MOTHER's research coordinator.</em>    </p>
