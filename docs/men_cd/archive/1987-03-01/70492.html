                      <p><strong>      How to help your animals birth healthy youngsters.</strong></p>  	<h5 id="byline">By Randy Kidd, D.V.M.</h5>         <p>      Few events signify spring more beautifully than the births      of baby animals. Since we're entering the season when many      species bear young-and when all animal owners must face the      task of helping as best they can-here are some tips      to ease you through those joyful, but often nerve-racking,      birth days.    </p>     <h3>Getting Ready</h3>    <p>      Ideally, you've already taken several steps to prepare your      expectant critters for motherhood. Although it's beyond the      scope of this article to list each individual specie s'      needs, it's important that you at least have had your      mothers-to-be vaccinated, wormed, and treated for external      parasites no less than 30 days before the expected birth      date. (You've kept accurate records so you know when that      date is, right?)    </p>    <p>      As the day nears, prepare a warm, dry, draft-free, and      absolutely clean birthing place. A few days before the      blessed event, you may want to clip away any excess hair      around the vulva and teats and scrub the areas well. (Such      clipping is especially important for ewes and pigs, but not      necessary for rabbits or cats.)    </p>    <p>      Put your midwifery supplies someplace where you'll be able      to find them quickly. Have several clean drying towels      handy (old bath towels or diapers work fine). A small,      wide-mouthed bottle filled with iodine is ideal for      sanitizing a newborn's dangling umbilical cord. With the      cord immersed in the iodine, simply hold the bottle tightly      against the little one's belly and turn the bottle and baby      over. (This isn't required for rabbits.)    </p>    <p>      Most births proceed without a hitch and present no      problems. It's always a good idea, though, to have your      veterinarian's phone number handy-both for regular hours      and after hours. And you might want to read MOTHER No. 85's      article "Livestock Parturition" for information on handling      troublesome deliveries yourself-just in case.    </p><h3> Keys to Survival</h3> <p>      The first few hours of any youngster's life are the most      critical. The two essential keys to helping a babe through      these hours are to make certain it gets its life-giving      dose of colostrum and to be sure it is warm and dry.    </p>    <p>      Colostrum is a special kind of milk that the mother      produces during the first few days of baby's life; it      provides important antibodies against diseases and serves      as an exceedingly rich source of nutrients. Colostrum can      be absorbed by a newborn's gut for only a few hours after      birth... so it's essential that baby gets to nurse right      away.    </p>    <p>      Animals are born with a special kind of fat, called brown      fat, that acts as a source of fuel for generating heat. The      problem is, there usually isn't much of a brown fat supply,      and in really frigid climes this heat generator may be      totally depleted in a matter of hours. So it's vital that      you do everything you can to keep newborns warm and dry.    </p>    <p>      A brisk rubdown with a towel immediately after birth will      warm the baby, stimulate its breathing, and dry it off. (Of      course, you have to be there when all the action occurs      -that's why it's so important to keep a close eye on      expectant mothers.) After baby is completely dry, make      certain that the bedding, too, is dry and clean, and be      sure there are no drafts.    </p>    <p>      Many animal owners use a heat lamp for helping keep little      ones toasty warm. That's OK, but there are some problems      you should consider.    </p>    <p>      For most critters the ideal beginning temperature under a      heat lamp-measured next to the bedding-is 80° to      85°F. (According to standard procedure, you then      decrease this five to 10 degrees each week until you reach      ambient temperature.) Unfortunately, that's also the ideal      temperature for growing bad guy bacteria. Many goat and      sheep breeders have found that their lamb and kid crops are      healthier without the lamp-so long as there is plenty of      bedding and a companion or two to cuddle up to. The bottom      line is, if you're going to use a heat lamp, you'll need to      clean up the bedding underneath it at least four or five      times a day.    </p>    <p>      Another problem with heat lamps is that they are a fire      hazard. Vermin seem to relish the taste of exposed      electrical cord, creating a volatile situation that's      definitely not conducive to your animals' (or your barn's)      good health.    </p>    <p>      The following are some special considerations for the birth      days of individual species.    </p>  <h3> Dogs and Cats</h3> <p>      Reasonably enough, expectant canines and felines tend to      choose the most comfortable spot around for having their      litters. Unfortunately, that often means the family sofa, a      bed, or under the porch (where you can't help if      necessary). To avoid this situation, try to get momma-to-be      accustomed to the place you'd like her to use as a delivery      room. Keep her confined to that area, most of the time      anyway, for about a week before her due date.    </p> <h3>  Rabbits</h3>   <p>      Born naked and helpless, the young rabbit needs a home safe      from the elements. Mother rabbit provides an insulating bed      of fur that she has pulled out from under her chin. Your      job is to provide a nest box that measures 18 to 22 inches      long by 12 inches wide by 12 inches high in the back. (See      "Ten Commandments for Raising Healthy Rabbits," issue 61.)      Put the box in the hutch three days before kindling-any      earlier and the doe tends to use it as a bathroom; later      can be disastrous, because the mother might not be      sufficiently accustomed to the nest box to use it, and      babies born outside the box may not stay warm enough to      survive.    </p>    <p>      In really frigid weather, mother's fur nest may not be      adequate. You can help by lining the inside walls of the      nest box with plastic foam (supermarket meat trays work      well) and making sure that the nest box and the hutch are      well out of the wind.    </p>    <p>      Chances are you won't be able to see if the bunnies get      their colostrum. Doe rabbits feed their young for only a      few minutes during a    </p>    <p>      24-hour period, and this is done at night, when no one is      around. Check the bunnies in two or three days to see that      they're potbellied healthy.    </p>  <h3>Sheep</h3>   <p>      Ewes tend to wander off from their lambs right after they      give birth. To discourage this wanderlust, pen momma a few      days before she's due in an enclosure that's four feet on a      side, and keep her there with her offspring until she      accepts them as hers.    </p>  <h3> Goats</h3> <p>      Feeding colostrum to goat kids may present another kind of      problem. Recent evidence indicates that an insidious      disease, caprine arthritis and encephalitis (CAE), may be      passed in the colostrum. Some goat owners pasteurize their      does' colostrum before feeding the kids-check with your      veterinarian for current info on this problem.    </p>  <h3>Pigs</h3>   <p>      Since they are nearly hairless, piglets need a warmed      environment, beginning at about 85°F. On the other      hand, mother pig is comfortable in a room that's about      50° to 60°F. If she's hot and uncomfortable, she'll      be continually up and down-and each trip is a potential      piglet smasher. The key to keeping mother from being a bone      crusher is to have her farrow in a farrowing crate-an      enclosure measuring about three feet wide by seven feet      long-that allows the piglets to scurry out and away from      her. <strong>(See "How to Breed Healthy Pigs" in issue      64.)</strong> To be sure the wee ones stay warm when      they're separated from mom, provide a heat lamp or a floor      area that's been prewarmed with a heating pad.    </p>   <h3> A Final Tip</h3>  <p>      The advice that I give most often to expectant animal      owners, and that undoubtedly is the hardest to follow, is      stay calm. Animals <em>know</em> when you're nervous and      they pick up on it. I've seen a momma dog start labor and      then stop-for two days-when she sensed her owner's      apprehension. So whatever you do, try to keep your      composure.    </p>
