                        <p>      <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing art, light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting hack to the land and firing a life of      voluntary simplicity is well they should he, since they      originally homesteaded</em> it <em>run-down farm in      Vermont's Green Mountains away back in the autumn of      1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to more on to</em>      <em>rock) inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they're been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one, the Nearings hare      learned a few things about homesteading and getting hack to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they're      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, end your question or      questions about self-sufficient lining on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) ", P.O. Box      70,</em> Henderson <em>N.C. 28791. And please don't</em>      <em>expect personal replies to your queries. The most      important and most frequently asked questions will be      answered here-and here only-where we</em> all      <em>can read what the Nearings hare to say.</em>    </p>		    <p>      Help please! How would you-being      vegetarians-teach a youngster that the meatless way      is best, <em>without</em> causing him or her to lose faith      in a schoolteacher who's instructing the class about the      four basic food groups?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Which would you prefer . . . that your child have      confidence in you and your chosen lifestyle, or in his or      her schoolteacher . . . a person who may be pushing a way      of thinking that represents values opposed to those you're      trying to teach? All you can do is</strong>      <strong><em>shots</em> your children the best way you know      how to live, share that life with them, teach them to be      considerate of every living thing . . . and let      <em>them</em> educate the <em>teacher,</em> if that's      necessary.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'm interested in working with you next summer. Back in      MOTHER NO. 68 you mentioned that you see visitors from 3:00      to 5:00 p.m. daily . . . but I'd like to know whether you      ever take anyone on for a longer period of time, perhaps      for a month or two, as part of an informal apprenticeship      program?    </p>    <p>      <strong>We no longer have an apprenticeship program, even      though-in the past-we</strong>      <strong><em>have</em> allowed groups of would-be      homesteaders to work with us. However, we've found that      doing so requires a good deal of time and organization, as      well as a great number of extra tools, if the program is to      operate to the satisfaction of all involved. And now that      Scott's in his 90's and Helen in her 70's, we feel it's      time to pull in our horns a bit. We garden on only four      acres at present, tend our own wood supply, and do a      moderate amount of building on our site . . . and all of      these tasks are easily completed without outside      help.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Last spring we moved from the mountains of Wyoming (where      cultivating a productive garden plot was all but      impossible) to the warm Colorado plains . . . and I had      visions of growing a wide variety of vegetables at our new      home. Well, this year's backyard plot <em>flourished,</em>      but then-come midsummer-grasshoppers began      eating everything in sight. We didn't want to use chemicals      on the garden, so we tried spraying the voracious insects      with solutions of hot peppers, onions, and soap-to name      just a few-but the pests seemed to <em>thrive</em> on our      homemade infusions. Now I don't mind feeding a <em>few</em>      bugs . . . but by season's end the invaders had harvested      more of our produce than we had!    </p>    <p>      Have you ever faced a similar problem, or do you have any      suggestions on how we can battle the hoppers next year . .      . so we'll have a <em>successful</em> garden?    </p>    <p>      <strong>We've never undergone a siege of insects such as      you describe.</strong> <strong>We <em>have</em> had more      grasshoppers around this year than ever before . . . but      they're in no way devastating the garden. By moving from      the mountains to the plains, of course, you've changed from      one climatic belt to another, thereby subjecting your      garden to the "new" pests that thrive in the warmer      temperatures.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>If your homemade sprays don't take care of the      grasshopper problem <em>next</em> year, you might try      covering the entire growing ground with a finemesh nylon      net, as we did with our plantation of 200 cultivated      blueberries when birds began to devour the dele</strong>      <strong>ctable crop.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Do you feel that it's important for homesteaders to have a      spiritual connection with the world around them? If so,      what do you do in order to nurture your spiritual life?    </p>    <p>      <strong>In every life relationship there are physical,      mental, and spiritual concerns . . . and we believe that      it's important for each person-whether homesteader or      city dweller-to recognize such obligations and to      deal with them accordingly. For our part, we meditate and      dedicate ourselves daily to living in harmony with nature,      humanity, and the cosmos.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I'd like to know if you recommend saving your own vegetable      seed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>No, we feel that seed selection is too highly      specialized for the average homesteader to tackle.      Furthermore, on a simply practical scale, the space which      would be required in order to produce one's own seed would      probably be wasteful in relation to the small quantity      needed. For instance, a pinch or two of lettuce seed is all      we use to grow our year's supply of the salad fixings. It      would be extremely inefficient for a land-limited gardener      to devote yards of growing</strong> <strong>space to plants      that are merely going to seed.</strong>    </p>    <p>      I realize that both of you have been extremely active in      the concerns of your community, and you've obviously tried,      through your publications, to share your views with other      people. Do you feel, then, that it's morally wrong for      homesteaders to run from the complicated problems of the      "real" world by living in isolation and hiding their heads      in organic soil?    </p>    <p>      <strong>The "real" world is not exclusively the world of      the city . . . nor is it found solely in nature, books, or      art. The real world is the world within us and around us,      wherever we are.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>It is important for the homesteader who seeks a      fulfilling life for <em>others,</em> as well as for      him-or herself, to keep in touch with current      happenings in the world. Back- to-the-landers need not "cop      out" when going to the country to live, but rather they      can, and <em>should,</em> be aware of as much of the sum      total of existence as is possible.</strong>    </p>    <p>      In <em>Continuing the Good Life you</em> mention the      open-kettle canning of a tomato, celery, and onion      mixture. All of the food preservation books that I've come      across say that such a concoction should be put up by the      pressure-canning method in order to avoid any      possibility of botulism contamination. What are your      comments on this?    </p>    <p>      <strong>We never pressure-can our homegrown food. For      40 years, Helen has put up hundreds of bottles of fruits      and vegetables by the openkettle method (which is by far      the simplest way to can), and we've had no problems with      food poisoning. Occasionally, of course (in perhaps one of      a hundred jars), the contents will spoil because of      inadequate closure, caused by a bad rubber seal or a      cracked glass cover. The lids of such imperfect jars pop up      to indicate the spoilage . . . and we dispose of the      contents. However, it's very important to remember that the      vegetables we can by the open-kettle method are always      highly acidic. Low-acid foods, such as beans and corn,      would</strong> <strong><em>require</em> the high heat of      pressure. canning . . . so those foods we either freeze or      dry.</strong>    </p>
