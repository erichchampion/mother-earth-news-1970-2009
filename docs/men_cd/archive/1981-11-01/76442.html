                        <p>      <strong>CONGRESSMAN TONY HALL</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Energy Tax Act of 1978 <em>scented</em> like good news,      since it offered generous credits to individuals and      businesses using alternative energy installations to cut      down on their needs for nonrenewable fuel sources. However,      since that legislation was passed, its geothermal clause      has fallen prey to what Rep. Tony P. Hall (D-Ohio) calls an      "arbitrary" ruling of the Internal Revenue Service.    </p>    <p>      In addition to its solar and windpower provisions, you see,      the Energy Tax Act sought to encourage the use of      geothermal energy by granting a 407, tax credit on the cost      of "earthpowered" equipment to heat or cool residences, and      a 10% credit for commercial buildings (with a maximum      allowance of $4,000) .    </p>        <p>      However, the IRS has ruled that-in order for an owner      to qualify for the tax credit-his w her geothermal      source must register a temperature of at least 122°F.      That regulation, unfortunately, made most buildings in the      eastern half of the U.S. ineligible . . . since-in      that region-ground water of about 50°F provides      much of the available geothermal energy.    </p>    <p>      And that, says Rep. Hall, "is precisely the sort of petty      bureaucratic nonsense that we're trying to eliminate from      the federal government". Furthermore, maintains the Ohio      lawmaker, 'The IRS temperature ruling ... ignores the      tremendous energy-saving potential of lower-temperature      geothermal sources that are just as valuable <em>as      other</em> forms of renewable energy."    </p>    <p>      To thwart the tax bureau's action, Hall and his colleague      Rep. Don Clauses (R-Calif.) have introduced bipartisan      legislation (House bill 4091) tnat would eliminate the      IRS's ability to set a temperature requirement. At press      time, the Hall-Clauses bill <em>was</em> scheduled for      hearings before the House Ways and Means subcommittee of      Select Revenue Measures.-JM.    </p>    <p>      <strong>JOHN GOFMAN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Dr. John Gofman-former atomic energy scientist,      renowned heart disease researcher, antinuclear advocate,      and the subject of MOTHER's Plowboy Interview in issue      68-has written a recently released book called      <em>Radiation and Human Health</em> (Sierra Club Books,      $29.95). This <em>massive</em> (908-page) tome is the      result of years of study and is, as its subtitle proclaims,      "a comprehensive investigation of the evidence relating      lowlevel radiation to cancer and other disease".    </p>    <p>      The detailed textbook serves several important purposes    </p>    <p>      [1] It demystifies the study of radiation. Even though      there are reams of statistical calculations ("this book is      not bedtime reading," Gofman notes), every mathematical      step is clearly and completely explained. The subject can      now be understood by the interested and studious layperson      . . . not just by the "expert".    </p>    <p>      [2] <em>It establishes a consistent numerical standard for      identifying cancer mortality risk.</em> Taking special care      to balance various studies by considering the differences      in their followup periods, the age of their subjects, and      the quality of their data, Dr. Gofman has come up with a      common base for estimating the cancer mortality rate per      rad exposure by age. This methodology breakthroughwhich is      supported by over 200 pages of clear, concise textprovides      the reader with a concrete tool for estimating lowdose      radiation damage.    </p>    <p>      [3] It responds to specific questions.    </p>    <p>      Should an airline stewardess avoid flying during early      pregnancy? Is watching color television a significant      radiation hazard'.' What are the odds that giving      radioactive iodine to a 25-year-old with hyperthyroidism      will cause the patient to die later of a radiation-induced      cancer? The text discusses these and many more "real life"      radiation hazard situations.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Gofman has made an enormous contribution to public      well-being by writing <em>Radiation and Human Health.</em>      Let's hope that other radiation scientists respond      seriously and honestly to his findings.-PS.    </p>    <p>      <strong>JIM CHANNON</strong>    </p>    <p>      In 1978 Lt. Col. Jim Channon was assigned by the U.S.      Army's Task Force Delta-a "think tank" of      officers-to investigate the self-awareness movement      in California and evaluate how its ideas might be used in      the military group's effort to "humanize" the armed      services. After attending over 100 sessions on New Age      philosophies and activities, Channon synthesized what he      felt was best in the various human-potential disciplines      into a hypothetical "Natural Guard" which-somewhat to      the officer's surprise-has begun to make the      transition from idea to reality.    </p>    <p>      The First Earth Battalion (as as Channon calls his proposed      new army unit ) will comprise men and women known as      "Warrior-Monks" . . . whose extraordinary skills would      combine courage and strength with sensitivity and the      spirit of sacrifice. The spiritual soldiers will-it's      planned-move <em>beyond</em> traditional weaponsbased      combat ( which Channon labels Force of Arms) to achieve the      higher ethic of Force of Spirit . . . and, ultimately,      Force of Heart. At the proposed First Earth Battalion      Academy in Santa Fe, New Mexico, recruits will study      meditation, fasting, isolation, philosophy,      <em>defensive</em> martial arts, and other nondestructive      ways of dealing with crises. Eventually, Channon expects      his warrior-monks to intervene in international      <em>and</em> local conflicts, where it's hoped that they'll      be able to prevail by a show of superior <em>ethical</em>      force.    </p>    <p>      The military hierarchy's initial reaction to Channon's      project has been encouraging: He was invited to present his      concept to the cadets at West Point... and that      presentation was videotaped for further distribution.      However, the futurist now needs funds-which will have      to come either from private sources or from      Congress-to transform his vision into a functioning      program. Chanson emphasizes that membership in the First      Earth Battalion is open to everyone: ''If you want to be a      member, you already are," he says. 'In tact, you can begin      <em>right</em> now to prepare yourself for the more precise      training that will take place within the battalion.-      <em>JM.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>IN BRIEF...</strong>    </p>    <p>      Pulitzer Prize-winning biologist and author RENE DUBOS (      who was interviewed in MOTHER NO. 6) has written a new      book, <em>Celebrations of Life</em> (McGraw-Hill, $12.95),      which suggests local solutions to global problems . . ..      Another familiar name on publishers' rolls is ROBERT      RODALE, whose collection of recommendations for future      lifestyles is titled Our <em>Next Frontier</em> ( Rodale      Press, $14.95). . . .'The late-summer opening of our      nation's first methanol service station-which is      owned by Future Fuels of America-in Sepulveda,      California earned the praise of Los Angeles mayor TOM      BRADLEY, and actors CHARLTON HESTON and LORNE GREENS. .      Congressmen ALBERT GORE: (D-Tenn.), NEAL SMITH (D-Iowa),      and HENRY WAXMAN (D-Calif.) have introduced a bill to call      for mandatory labeling of sodium and potassium content in      processed foods .... Cancer pioneer and Plowboy Interviewee      (MOTHER NO. .54) DR. HAROLD MANNER recently conducted a      seminar for members of the medical profession on his      innovative method of treating degenerative diseases such as      cancer and arthritis. Dr. Manner has also producedthrough      his Illinois-based research foundation-a booklet that      outlines the "Manner Metabolic Therapy" for cancer.      <em>-JM.</em>    </p>
