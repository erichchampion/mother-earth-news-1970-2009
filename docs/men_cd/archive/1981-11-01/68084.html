                <p>      <strong>A shepherd tells how to best survive the most      critical time of the year.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>PART I PREPARING YOUR FLOCK</strong><br />      <strong>Elora McKenzie</strong>    </p>    <p>      Whether you're managing five pregnant ewes or 500-as      my husband Mac and I did last spring-you'll soon find      that establishing a routine lambing procedure can keep      birthing nightmares to a minimum. After nearly six years in      the sheep business, my husband and I have come up with      several shepherding techniques that make our lives a lot      easier during this crucial time of year. Perhaps by sharing      some of our hard-won experience we can spare you some of      the agony and expense that comes from learning about      lambing by trial and error. Using our tools and procedures      won't necessarily result in the <em>200%</em> lamb crop      every shepherd hopes for of course, but it may (at least)      keep you from having such a lousy time with lambing that      you give up on sheep raising altogether!    </p>    <h3>      PREPARATION    </h3>    <p>      Many of the steps that can help insure successful,      hassle-free lambing experiences should be taken well      <em>before</em> the actual birthing days begin. Indeed,      such preparatory measures are so important that I'll devote      this entire article to them. Then, in MOTHER NO. 73, I will      describe a good shepherd's duties during those      exciting-and tiring-"birthday weeks".    </p>    <p>      Mac and I start our lambing preparations, six months before      we see the first fuzzy babe, by <em>worming</em> and      <em>flushing</em> our herd. Both actions will, by boosting      the fertility of our rams and ewes, improve the chance for      multiple births . . . and increase our lamb crop by as much      as 20%!    </p>    <p>      We find the best prebreeding wormer to be the oral      medication Levamisole. (Ask your vet for a recommendation,      though, as other medicines might be more suited to specific      problems in your area.) This broad-spectrum parasiticide      kills almost all stomach and intestinal worms in sheep, and      wipes out lungworms (parasites that inhibit breathing) as      well.    </p>    <p>      The term "flushing" refers to giving livestock a short-term      quality and quantity increase in their feed. A month before      breeding begins, we start feeding each sheep 1/4 to 1/2      pound of grain per day, and turn all the animals out in      lush fall pastures. If, however, the new pas ture is      largely legumes-such as clover or alfalfa-we're      careful to set the animals on the new land for only short      periods of time at first, and then to increase their      grazing time gradually. This precaution protects the sheep      from bloat . . . a dangerous-and often      fatal-entrapment of gas in the rumen that can follow      a too rapid ingestion of legumes.    </p>    <h3>      SCHEDULE BREEDING    </h3>    <p>      If your ram's free-as a relative of ours used to      say-to "spread his raw oats" from Labor Day to      Mother's Day, you won't know whether your ewes were bred      for a January "drop" in nine-below-zero weather (in which      case you'll get lamb popsicles instead of sheep if the      newborns aren't immediately sheltered) or July birthings      (when summer flies can practically devour both mothers      <em>and</em> offspring).    </p>    <p>      A good shepherd will, therefore, limit the range of lamb      birthdays by [a] pasturing all rams      <em>separately-and secure</em> ly-until      approximately five months in advance of the desired first      lambing date, and [b] removing the sire from the ewe      pasture five months before the date upon which he or she      hopes the season will end.    </p>    <p>      Or, to be more specific: A sheep's gestation period is      roughly 143 to 150 days (it varies some from one breed or      individual to another). So if you want your first lambs to      arrive soon after February 24, let his highness start      breeding the ewes on September 28. Then if you plan to stem      the tide of newborns after, say, May 25, you'll have to      sentence the stud to celibacy by December 27.    </p>    <p>      Since the estrus (heat) cycle of a ewe is approximately 17      days, that 91-day breeding program would allow each ewe      five cycles to become pregnant . . . and believe me, a well      cared-for animal that hasn't been successfully bred      after five tries simply isn't worth feeding. In fact, on      our large farm, we allow breeding during two heat cycles      only. Those females that turn up barren at lambing time (an      average of 5% annually) are culled . . . that is, sent to      either the auction block or the freezer.    </p>    <p>      There's a good reason for our establishing a shorter      breeding season, too. After all, 91 consecutive days of      making nightly (3:00 a.m.) lamb checks, attending difficult      births (sometimes for days at a stretch), and trying to      keep track of the separate feeding requirements of pregnant      and lambed ewes would seem like an eternity of labor. By      limiting the breeding time, we guarantee a shorter lambing      season, keep our farm functioning on a practical basis,      <em>and</em> avoid nervous breakdowns!    </p>    <h3>      IDENTIFY YOUR EWES    </h3>    <p>      You won't be able to tell which animals should be culled at      the end of the season unless all your sheep are properly      identified. Of course, if you've got only a few      wool-bearers, you can <em>name</em> the      individuals-we started out with Granny, Fancy, and      W.B. (Wild Bastard) ourselves-but anyone with more      than five sheep will find numbered ear tags essential. Be      sure to attach the markers to your flock members well ahead      of lambing season . . . so you won't put the expectant      mothers through potentially stressful experiences just      prior to delivery time.    </p>    <p>      Our ewes each wear two tags: a slim metal label in one ear      (put on when the animal was a youngster) and a large,      plastic, double-sided tab-which is easy to read from      a distance-in the other. The bigger labels can be      really helpful in the long-range "detective work" a      shepherd often gets involved in during lambing time. (It'd      be great if a ewe would walk up to you and confess, "Hi!      I'm No. 161, and I just had twins back there behind the      barn. One's dead and I don't much care for the other." That      kind of cooperation, however, is a bit rare.)    </p>    <h3>      SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT    </h3>    <p>      Two months before the first lamb is due, we organize all      the birthing equipment we have and order any new items      we'll need. Keep in mind, though, that Mac and I have a      large operation, and almost all the births occur out in the      fields. A small-scale shepherd, especially one who keeps      any expectant ewes in a barn-as could well be the      case in cold weather-might not need all the equipment      described here.    </p>        <p>      <em>[1] Iodine.</em> We use a 7%, solution of the      disinfectant (it's available from a veterinarian,      veterinary supply house, or feed store) to coat all the      newborns' navel cords <em>immediately</em> after birth.      This procedure will help to prevent bacteria caused "navel      ills" (infections) and/or lamb scours (diarrhea).    </p>    <p>      <em>[2] A 60-cc. syringe with a small-bore rubber      catheter</em> When my husband and I are nearly exhausted      from long days <em>and</em> nights, foul weather, and      uncooperative mothers, the last thing either of us wants to      do is try to con a reluctant ewe into standing still . . .      or convince a starved but confused infant that it needs to      nurse. With the syringe and a 14" to 16" catheter (both      should be available from a local drugstore or medical/      <em>veterinary supply</em> company), we can quickly and      easily tube-feed a small lamb some of the vital      antibody-laden colostrum (the milk a mother produces the      first day after birth) that it needs to survive.    </p>                    <p>      <em>[3] Corn colostrum.</em> Emergency supplies of ewe      colostrum are hard to come by, and there is no reliable      synthetic substitute. Cow colostrum, though, can provide a      newborn lamb with the necessary antibodies and vitamin A,      as well as help set its digestive system in motion . . .      and the calf nurser, is readily available. (In fact,      dairies often have to discard surplus colostrum !) So we      try to obtain a gallon or two of the defense-giving fluid      from a local dairy at calving time, and freeze it in      plastic rneat trays.    </p>    <p>      We can then defrost the "first milk" when it's needed (be      careful, though . . . colostrum can easily be spoiled by      cooking, so if there's not time to thaw the liquid at room      temperature, it must be warmed <em>very</em> gradually in a      double boiler), load the syringe through the catheter tube,      clear the air from the dispenser, and give any weak      youngster a two-ounce swallow of milk. To do this, we      slowly slide the catheter tube down the lamb's gullet and      squeeze-gently-on the syringe's plunger to      squirt the milk out. You have to be careful not to send the      liquid down the newborn's windpipe (if you can feel the      tube traveling down the animal's neck and see it pressing      against the lamb's flesh as you install it, you're doing      fine) and to inject the milk slowly, so it doesn't bubble      over into the windpipe. Otherwise, the youngster could come      down with pneumonia.    </p>    <p>      [4] <em>LamDry rovers.</em> Believe it or not, we're crazy      about these plastic lamb raincoats! In cold or wet weather,      a baby sheep can lose 50%, of its body heat within half an      hour after it's dropped. Since most of our lambs are born      in Aprilwhen a gentle spring rain can suddenly turn into a      nasty ice storm-we dress all the newborns in LamDry      covers to help lock in their body heat. And to lessen the      (remote) possibility that a ewe will reject her,      trench-coated offspring, we also smear some of the mother's      afterbirth on each newborn <em>tarot</em> its wrapper . . .      then remove the rain gear three days later, when we dock      the youngster's tail. LamDrys are available from Sheepman      Supply (see the list of suppliers that accompanies this      article).    </p>    <p>      [5] <em>Lamb tags and pliers.</em> We're reminded of the      importance of being able to easily identify lambs-as      well is ewes-each time we discover a lost youngster.      The little one's tag enables us to restore it to family      security in an instant.    </p>    <p>      To label the babes, we use specially designed pliers that      punch through the animals' ears and attach small aluminum      tags. (Both items are available from sheep supply houses.)      And we make sure the loops hang free . . . to allow room      for the animals' subsequent growth.    </p>    <p>      <em>[6] Lambing records</em> Since it's necessary for any      serious sheep-raising operation to keep track of which ewes      are good <em>breeders and</em> which will need to be      culled, we maintain record sheets that can provide us with      a wealth of detail at a glance. If you look at the      accompanying sample file, you'll see just how informative      such a sheet can be.    </p>    <p>      Some of the headings on the form may not be      self-explanatory. "Color" identifies whiteface or blackface      offspring. "Graft" refers to the technique of transferring      an orphaned lamb to a surrogate mother . . . in this case,      one newborn was grafted to greentagged No. 130. "Oxy" is      our shorthand label for a drug, oxytocin, sometimes      administered to initiate milk flow. "Asst." denotes that      the mother needed birthing assistance. And "turned out"      marks the date the lamb and ewe were moved out to open      pasture.    </p>    <p>      <em>[7] Halter.</em> Since Mac and I alternate lamb check      shifts, we each often single-handedly cope with      emergencies-such as a lamb that needs to be pulled      out of a skittish yearling ewe-in the field.      Therefore, we always carry a sheep halter to snub a ewe to      the fence in such situations. (A restrainer can be made      from baling twine-just tie a simple noose-or      purchased from a sheep supply house.)    </p>    <p>      <em>[8] Hurdles.</em> These folding half-pens are made of      two five-foot-long, lightweight-lumber fence sections that      have been hinged together. We position hurdles near the      lambing area's fenceline to form temporary pens. Since      twin-bearing ewes sometimes reject one offspring when in      open pasture-while a short period of confinement      together can help <em>ce</em> <em>ment</em> family      relationships-we "jug" (as hurdle-penning is often      called) all mothers that give birth to two lambs until the      parent seems to accept both children. At other seasons the      conveniently mobile-if somewhat flimsy-fence      sections serve as chutes for pasture rotation, stalls for      worming, temporary fence patches, and hospital pens.    </p>    <p>      <em>[9] Antibiotics and a syringe with I8-gauge      needles.</em> We keep both oxytetracycline and      dihydrostreptomycin-penicillin on hand during lambing.      Oxytetracycline is administered to any ewe that's just had      a birthing trauma. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: We'd recommend      consulting a vet when a ewe has serious lambing      difficulties.]</em> And one-half milliliter of      dihydrostreptomycin-penicillin is given to <em>lambs . . .      to</em> help prevent a pinkeye irritation that can be      caused by nursing through dirty wool. (Ideally, expectant      ewes should be "crutched"-that is, shorn around the      crotch and udder-before lambing time. Since we don't always      manage to shave every ewe on our busy farm, we occasionally      have to fight pinkeye with appropriate medical artillery.)    </p>    <p>      <em>[10] Docking and castration equipment.</em> Most      shepherds have strong opinions about which docking and      castration tools are best. We've experimented with      <em>all</em> the common techniques, though,      and-through experience-have come to feel that      the most humane yet thorough methods for the two procedures      are to dock tails with a burdizzo (a clamping instrument)      and knife . . . and to castrate with a knife alone. Both      operations can be accomplished quickly-thereby      causing less <em>extended</em> trauma for the lamb than      other techniques do-and don't usually cause much      bleeding.    </p>    <h3>      USEFUL OPTIONS    </h3>    <p>      Here are some <em>optional</em> tools that have proved very      useful around our farm.    </p>    <p>      <em>[11] Long-handled aluminum fishing dip nets.</em> If      your sheep are all pets, this sort of lamb-snatching device      may seem outrageous, but if-like us-you need to      catch a number of speedy and agile three-day-olds each year      for tail docking, a net can help a lot!    </p>    <p>      <em>[12] Lamb milk replacer, lamb nipples, and pop      bottles.</em> When a mother dies or rejects a twin and      there isn't a substitute parent available for the orphan,      you'll have to raise the foundling yourself. Lamb milk      replacer and nipples that fit a standard soft-drink      bottle-the usual tools for this job-are      generally available at feed stores. Properly formulated      <em>lamb</em> replacer, by the way, has an entirely      different salt balance and fat content from <em>calf</em>      replacer, so don't use the bovine compound.    </p>    <p>      [13] <em>Thermal vacuum bottle.</em> We carry an insulated      jug filled with warm colostrum on every lamb check so that      we can tube-feed any weak newborns on the spot.    </p>    <p>      <em>[14] Wagon.</em> A garden cart-or even a child's      toy wagon-is a useful vehicle for carrying supplies      around in a field.    </p>    <p>      <em>[15] Bedding.</em> Since we use lambing pens only      occasionally, clean bedding is largely an optional item for      us. It's essential, however, when lambing occurs in a barn.      The floors of such areas must be kept scrupulously      sanitary-and the bedding changed often-to ward      off lamb scours and other evils. Clean hay is excellent for      this purpose. Sawdust bedding, on the other hand, may get      tangled up in the wool and-if it does-sharply      reduce the fur's salability.    </p>    <p>      <em>[16] Selenium and vitamin E.</em> To prevent an ailment      called white muscle disease, many shepherds routinely      inject their lambs with a selenium-vitamin E combination .      . . especially if the animals will graze on soils deficient      in these nutrients. (Consult your vet for more      information.)    </p>    <h3>      HEALTH AND NUTRITION BEFORE LAMBING    </h3>    <p>      Four to six weeks before lambing be gins, we put pregnant      ewes on maternity grain rations. Textbooks suggest starting      out with 1/4 to 1/2 pound of grain per sheep per day, and      increasing the diurnal ration to 1-1/2 pounds per animal.      We've found, however, that applying a set recipe to a whole      flock doesn't work well, since some ewes will need more      feed than others. (Fat animals, for instance, don't lamb      easily . . . while skinny ones have weak offspring and      produce little milk.) So we either match the middle range      of our herd's requirement or, if necessary, divvy the flock      into two or even three feed groups.    </p>    <p>      In addition, since strong sheep give birth more easily than      do weak ones, we make sure the ewes get plenty of moderate      walking exercise by setting the grain rations out at some      distance from th <strong>e</strong> animals' grazing area.    </p>    <p>      A good prebirthing diet and exercise program should also      help prevent pregnancy toxemia, or ketosis, in your      expectant ewes. This serious, and frequently fatal, malady      is caused by a disturbance of the animal's sugar      metabolism. Afflicted sheep will tend to be weak and      listless. They may also grind their teeth, lose their      appetites, become constipated, and develop an "off" breath      smell. Consult a vet if you suspect toxemia in any of your      sheep so you can treat the deficien cy immediately. (The      doctor will usually recommend a commercial ketosis      medication, propylene glycol, or glycerin.)    </p>    <p>      Then, at least two weeks prior to lambing, we vaccinate the      ewes for enterotox emia (also called pulpy kidney or      overeating disease). One of the most common causes of lamb      deaths, this quick-striking killer has no known      treatmentand often gives no visible warning symptoms. It is      caused by a germ known as <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>      Type I). The bugs are normally present in small numbers in      the lower bowels of sheep, but can when heavy feeding or      rapid growth occurs-spread to the small intestine and      create a lethal poison.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, though, by vaccinating the ewes at least two      weeks prior to lambing, we can be sure that the youngsters      will pick up the immunity through their mothers' colostrum.      The lambs should also receive booster shots at four to      eight weeks of age, as further insurance against this      disease. (See your veterinarian for medication.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, Mac and I attend to <em>our own</em> health and      nutrition. During the lull before the lambing storm, I      stock the larder, bake extra bread, freeze heat-and-serve      meals, and prepare lots of yogurt to eat on the run! With a      whole farm full of ewes to help through birthing, the      lambing weeks figure to be rather like a marathon . . . and      we've found that poor nutrition makes poor shepherds. So      <em>regardless</em> of the hectic pace we keep up while our      flock is growing, my husband and I do take the time to      maintain a healthful diet.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: In our next issue, Elora will describe      standard</em> and emergency <em>lambing practices.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Information on administering livestock injections      properly can be found in</em> <em>Randy Kidds article "You      Can</em> <em>Too Give That Animal an Injection!" in MOTHER      NO. 53, page 92.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A fine shepherd's textbook.</em> Raising Sheep the      Modern Way <em>by Paula Simmons, is available for      $6.95-</em> <em>plus 95 cents shipping and      handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O.
