            <p>      Issue # 72 - November/December 1981</p>    <p>      Forget about expensive solar collectors. All the solar      energy you need to heat and cool your home is already      collected and stored.    </p>        <p>             Ronald Simmons    </p>        <p>      Thinking about solar energy? Good for you l I've been in      the heating and cooling business for many years, and I'm      completely convinced that solar energy is the most      practical solution to the energy crisis.    </p>    <p>      However, you may be shocked when you find out how much      solar collectors cost. Relax! I've got some good news for      you: the biggest and best solar collector in the world is      already in place at your doorstep. It's just waiting for      you to use it.    </p>    <p>      The biggest and best solar collector, of course, is good      old mother earth. Every day she soaks up tremendous amounts      of energy - enough energy to heat and cool every home,      school, office and factory in the world. Where is all this      energy stored? Well, much of it is stored in ground water -      in water just 50 to 100 feet deep in the ground.    </p>    <p>      And you can tap this energy for your own use, to heat and      cool your home. All it takes is a ground water heat pump      and a couple of water wells. That may sound like a      complicated and expensive system, but it's really a very      economical system that can pay for itself in fuel savings      in just a short time. Let me tell you how it works.    </p>    <p>      Here in Virginia, for example, the water 50 feet deep in      the ground stays at a constant temperature of 60° all      the time, summer and winter. With a ground water heat pump,      instead of cooling the outside coil of your air conditioner      with hot outside air, you cool it with 60° ground      water. Your compressor has to work only half as hard, and      you cut your electric bill in half.    </p>    <p>      In the winter, it's just the reverse. Instead of burning      expensive fuel, you use 60° ground water to boil Freon      in a heat pump. Again, it's a very simple system, and the      saving in your fuel bill is enormous.    </p>    <p>      And talk about conserving natural resources - the ground      water heat pump system doesn't waste a drop of water. All      the water you pump from one well goes right back into the      ground by way of a second well. And you don't pollute the      water, either. All you do is take some heat out of the      water in winter, and put some heat back in the water in      summer. It's like a great fly wheel with the sun replacing      the energy you use.    </p>    <p>      Some of the best-known companies in the industry are now      manufacturing ground water heat pumps, and the cost of the      equipment has become very reasonable. The only big expense      - the only reason everybody hasn't already switched to a      ground water heat pump system - is the high cost of      drilling two wells for each system. The prices commercial      drillers charge have gone out of sight. That's the reason I      got a HydraDrill.    </p>    <p>      Now I've got to say one thing: I never thought I wanted to      be a well driller, but I'd never seen anything like this      HydraDrill. Let me tell you. It was delivered to our shop      one afternoon, and I took it out to a job site to fool      around with it a little bit and see how it works. Wow!      Before I knew it, I had drilled down 50 feet! I had no idea      it would be so easy!    </p>    <p>      The next morning I took one of the boys with me and we      finished that well and put a pump on it and got a solid      stream of water. Then we moved to the other side of the      house and drilled the second well. In less than a day and a      half we had completed both wells. A commercial driller      would charge 3 or 4 times what it would cost us to do the      job ourselves.    </p>    <p>      And another thing, the Hydra-Drill goes places a commercial      driller couldn't take his big drilling rig. We can drill in      backyards. We can drill up next to the house. We can even      drill behind the rose bush if we want to. There's just no      place we can't drill with a Hydra-Drill.    </p>    <p>      We've got our drilling costs under control now, and our      ground water heat pump sales are spreading like wildfire. A      lot of times, we'll be drilling and a neighbor will come      over and ask us to drill a well for him. I have to say      "Sorry, we're just too busy. Why don't you get a      Hydra-Drill and put in the well yourself?"    </p>    <p>      People ask me about the Hydra-Drill They want to know if      it's practical and if I'm pleased with it. My answer is      "Definitely! Absolutely! I'm just amazed with it!"    </p>    <p>      NOTE: Mother's readers can get a big, fully illustrated      information kit on the HydraDrill including a booklet, "How      to Drill Your Own Well.
