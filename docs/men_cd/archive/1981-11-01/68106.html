                <p>      <strong>While you're preserving your orchard's produce this      fall, recycle the apple-canning leftovers into lovely      Christmas gifts!</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Phyllis V. Shaudys    </h5>        <p>      This year, when you put up the winter's supply of apple      products, why not get the jump on your Christmas gift      gathering (or holiday profitmaking) at the same time? To do      so, you can simply spice, shape, perfume, and dry any      leftover pulp into creative, fragrant "pomander sachets" .      . . to give to your family and friends or to sell at fall      bazaars, fairs, or gift shops that specialize in unique      homemade items.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT ARE THEY?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most of us think of pomanders as clovestudded oranges or      apples that have been rolled in spices and dried. In fact,      the word itself is derived from the French pomme      <em>d'ambre, meaning</em> "apple of amber", which-in      turn-refers to ambergris (the original scent used in      pomanders and still the base of many perfumes).    </p>    <p>      However, the current high price of whole cloves and fresh      fruit-as well as the time required to completely      cover one apple or orange with the tiny spices-can      turn the creation of old- fashioned pomanders into a      cash- <em>and</em> labor-intensive project.      But, by using the tips offered in this article, you can      actually go ahead and <em>consume</em> the tasty fruit . .      . and then fashion dozens of the long-lasting, aromatic,      and useful gifts <em>from the leftover waste!</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAKE "SECONDS" INTO "FIRSTS"</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you don't have your own apple trees, perhaps you can buy      "pick your own" (look for inexpensive windfalls) fruit from      a nearby orchard, or locate a produce outlet that sells      apple "seconds".    </p>    <p>      Last year, for example, I was able to buy half a bushel of      very high-quality "culls" from a rural market for $1.75,      and the varied flavors, when cooked and blended, made for      exceptionally tasty and colorful applesauce and jelly. In      fact-although your results may differ, depending upon      the juiciness of the fruit you use and the amount of water      added when cooking-four baskets (or $7.00 worth)      provided me with 100 eating apples, 20 quarts of      applesauce, 6 pints of apple butter, 35 halfpints of jelly,      8 quarts of fresh juice .. . and 200 apple-pulp sachets to      market (wholesale) to my herbal outlets. Better yet, the      sweet-smelling little globes sold out within a week or two,      bringing in an average of 50d each for a total of $100!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PRESERVE THE RESERVE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Orrisroot, a "fixative", is a vital pomander ingredient ...      since the substance absorbs the fruity, spicy blend and      preserves it for many years. It's made from European iris      roots, and-along with essential oils-can      usually be obtained from your pharmacy. If not, most herbal      mail order businesses carry such items, as well as ground      spices that are less expensive and of higher quality than      those the grocery usually offers. I'll provide you with a      list of catalogs if you send a stamped, self-addressed      envelope to me at Herbal Acres, Dept. TMEN, Box 428,      Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania 18977. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: Please include a dollar for Ms. Shaudys's time and      trouble when you do so.]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE POMANDER RECIPE</strong>    </p>    <p>      To make a batch of recycled sachets, measure out 4 cups of      the drained apple pulp left in your colander or food mill      (or simply turn the leftover cores into pulp) . . . and      stir in the following ground spices: 1 heaping tablespoon      of cloves, a little less than a tablespoon of nutmeg, 1-1/2      teaspoons of ginger, and 3 tablespoons of orrisroot. (If      you can't obtain powdered orrisroot, simply grind whole      pieces of the fixative in your blender.)    </p>    <p>      When the above ingredients are <em>thoroughly</em>      combined, shape the pulp into balls. Then make a blend of 6      tablespoons of powdered orrisroot, 10 to 12 drops of      essential oil (I use oil of rose, cloves, ambergris, or      patchouli), 1/2 cup of ground cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of      ground cloves . .. and roll the balls in the resulting      mixture until they begin to feel dry. (This recipe, which      may be halved or doubled, will yield about 50 pomanders.)    </p>    <p>      Now, wrap your scented spheres in squares of organdy (or      any other porous fabric that can be easily pinked with      shears to produce attractive edges) and hang them up to      dry. If you prefer to adorn them with fabric later on, you      can let the pulp balls rest in a large glass or plastic      container on top of any leftover spice mix, but      <em>don't</em> allow them to touch each other. Roll the      globes around periodically to expose all sides to the air      <em>and</em> to the spices.    </p>    <p>      I prefer to wrap the aromatic apple scraps in organdy right      away, so that a minimum of the spiciness will be lost      during the drying process. Also, I've found that the oil of      the still-damp spheres permeates the fabric, adding to the      strength of the finished pomanders' scent.    </p>    <p>      Next, I tie the cloth squares with thread or string, and      then loop them on a long ribbon to hang from the fireplace      mantle (where we already have nail holes used to secure the      family's Christmas stockings). The pungent fragrance given      off by the drying sachets perfumes the house, and the      colorful fabrics seem to give our home an aura of Christmas      long before it's actually time to decorate for the holiday.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PACKAGE MAKES PERFECT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Within a week or two, the pomanders will shrink slightly      and be dry enough to store in plastic bags until you're      ready to wrap them for gifts or package them for sale. As a      finishing touch, I cover the little packets with matching      squares of net, secured with bows of satin ribbon (which I      buy wholesale by the roll from a local floral supply house      at the cost of 5d a yard).    </p>    <p>      The pomander sachets can be packaged in plastic zip-lock      bags from your grocery store, three or five to a bag. A      descriptive label (you can type one up and photocopy it if      you make a large number of the gifts) will add to the      product's appeal. Do explain-on your label-that      the sachets are a variation of colonial pomanders . . . and      that they can be used in closets, drawers, or chests to      perfume and to help mothproof your clothing, linens, or      blankets.    </p>    <p>      If you're going to market the pomanders, a printed display      card that gives suggestions for using the bright little      balls will also help promote sales. I add a sign that      reads: "Use to decorate your Christmas tree, wreath, or      packages . . . hang in a cluster from the ceiling light . .      . or give as fragrant stocking stuffers, party favors, or      hostess gifts."    </p>    <p>      Your recycled apple pulp creations will give you and others      many pleasurable moments of aromatic delight over the      years. And the scent can even be revived in the distant      future, if need be, by adding a few drops of your favorite      perfume or oil .. . making the pomanders essentially      timeless gifts.    </p>
