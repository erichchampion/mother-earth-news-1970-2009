        <h3>It started as a hobby, but Pauline McCoskey found out that . . .</h3><p>With materials that cost about 30 cents, Pauline McCoskey can make a small statue that will sell for between $25 and $30! And-aside from peddling her figurines at local art shows and stores (which take all she can produce during the holiday season)-Pauline has more calls to <em>teach</em> (for a good salary) this papier-mache craft than she has time to handle!</p><p>If you'd like to learn the rewarding skill, just follow the step-by-step instructions outlined here.</p><p>[1] Cut rough torso and head shapes from plastic foam. Use quarter-inch dowels to connect the wooden base and torso, and toothpicks to attach the head.</p><p>[2] Fashion the arms from utility wire (covered with florist's tape) and then apply instant papier-mâché (available at hobby shops) to create facial features, hands, and any other parts of the body you want to show in detail.</p><p>[3] Allow the papier-mâché to dry for a day, then clothe your figure. Scraps of fabric-dipped in a heavy starch solution-can be draped in robe fashion. Some sewing is required . . . but sleeves-for example-can be attached to the garment with the same thick, sticky solution of household laundry starch that you'll use to give body to <em>all</em> of the statue's clothing. Starched embroidery thread serves as hair.</p><p>[4] On the following day-when your figurine is dry-spray-paint it. (Black or dark green enamel usually gives the most striking results.)</p><p>[5] Once the paint dries, rub your statue well with gold or pewter metallic wax (also available from your craft shop).</p><p>[6] The entire process should take about 5 to 15 hours-spread over a period of three days-and the characters you can create are many and varied!</p>
