    <p>
                <p>      Crisp, frost-nipped leaves crunch underfoot as the      fragrance of woodsmoke again fills the air. The tart      sweetness of apples is cap tured in cider's amber brew, and      the stored boun ty of the garden fills the holiday table.      Reflect for a grateful moment on gardens fulfilled, and      then turn your thoughts to the everbeckoning promise of      next year's harvest.    </p>            <p>      By this time of year, vegetable growers in Zones 3 and 4      are reduced to pulling a n occasional parsnip or cutting      some kale from the bedded-down garden. You folks can toss      another log on the fire, negotiate with the cat for space      on the sofa, and plan next year's crops.    </p>    <p>      In Zones 5 and 6 (where the first frosts are due October 10      and 20, respectively), growers can safely transplant two      garden perennials, asparagus and rhubarb, until the third      week of November (do your digging before the ground freezes      solid, though). Year-old asparagus roots should be planted      about a foot apart in footdeep trenches. Cover the roots      with several inches of compost-enriched soil, and      gradually, as the plants grow, till in the rest of the      trench.    </p>    <p>      Rhubarb roots can be spaced from two to four feet apart and      set so that the crowns are two to three inches below the      surface of the soil.    </p>    <p>      Don't harvest either asparagus or rhubarb at all during the      first season of growth . . . let the plants build up a      healthy, extensive root system. A light harvest is possible      in the second year, and after that you should be able to      cut the stems for up to eight weeks annually.    </p>    <p>      In Zones 7 (frost by November 1) and 8 (freezing weather      commencing about the 15th), only the very hardy greens like      corn salad and cress stand a chance of producing at this      late date in <em>unprotected ground</em> . . . but      gardeners who use cloches or cold frames can still raise a      respectable crop of leaf lettuce, mustard greens, or      spinach. To learn how to build an easy-to-store knockdown      cold frame, see the article by Peter Wotowiec and Clarence      Kinkelaar in MOTH ER NO. 55, page 54. (Back issue ordering      information is on page 52.)    </p>    <p>      Zone 9 gardeners, who face frost around December 1, can      still grow many greens: cabbage or collard transplants,      and-from seed-endive, kale, kohlrabi, leaf and head      lettuce, mustard, and spinach. In addition, you might have      luck with late crops of carrots, radishes, turnips, beets,      and peas (if you get 'em in early).    </p>    <p>      The fortunate folks in balmy Zone 10 will find the weather      cool enough now to plant a winter crop of garden peas.      Along with those tasty green globes, you can also sow      string beans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower .      . . and all of the vegetables listed for Zone 9. Imagine:      fresh peas for Christmas!    </p>    <p>      In most parts of the country, this is the time of year that      nutritious, <em>mineral-rich fertilizer falls</em> to      earth free. Yet (it's <em>hard to</em> believe) some folks      actually pay others to haul all that <em>garden      goodness</em> away to the dump. <em>These heavenly</em>      gifts, of <em>course, are</em> leaves . . . and it's <em>a      snap</em> to compost <em>na</em> ture's <em>annual</em>      gift into <em>a</em> rich soil <em>amendment that will both      add nutrients and improve filth. The</em> key <em>to quick,      effective</em> composting is to increase the amount of      surface area available to those <em>workhorse bacteria</em>      . . . and the way to do that is to shred those sheddings.      Just <em>rake</em> the <em>leaves</em> into foothigh      <em>piles, and then chop them up line</em> with several      passes of a rotary lawn mower.    </p>    <p>      To construct the compost heap, alternate <em>six-inch      layers</em> of <em>diced leaves with</em> one-inch layers      of soil (to provide the bacteria). <em>Since this</em>      late-season compost pile won't have any ni      <em>trogen-from rich</em> green organic      matter-in it, <em>you'll also need to add some of      that nutrient.</em> An <em>ideal compost heap has a 30:1      carbon/nitrogen ratio, and you can</em> approximate <em>the      proportions</em> by incorporating about a <em>pound of      blood</em> meal to <em>each two bushels of leaves. If you      have a source of</em> manure, a <em>leaf-to-manure      ratio</em> of 5:1 (by <em>volume) should do the trick,</em>      as well.    </p>    <p>      After you've <em>constructed the pile, water it thoroughly      and cover it with a piece</em> of <em>black plastic. Then,      every month or so, remove the plastic and turn</em> the      <em>mound</em> with <em>your garden</em> fork. By the time      spring <em>planting comes,</em> you should have a heap of      <em>goodness for</em> your garden.    </p>    <p>      A few months back, we told you about a new method of      composting that greatly speeds up the breakdown of the      organic material. Well, we've been unable to reach our      original Canadian source for more details of this good      news, but a company in Delaware is currently selling the      special Du Pont Tyvek felted plastic bags used in the      process. You can order five Post Haste Tyvek bags for $8.95      postpaid from Forenco, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 9088,      Wilmington, Delaware 19809.    </p>
