                <p>      <strong>A free material, which is particularly easy to find      around Christmas time, can be recycled into some dandy      storage containers and furniture pieces.</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Brad Bishop    </h5>		    <p>      Some of the most joyous days of my childhood were spent      rolling down hills in a discarded refrigerator box. Of      course, most people would think it eccentric for a grown      man to participate in such an activity (tempting as it      might be to do so on occasion), but I <em>still</em> use      corrugated cardboard in many decorative and practical      projects.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes I tend to wonder, though, whether I might have      banged my head a bit too hard on one of those trips      downhill, because <em>most</em> people seem to hold      cardboard in low esteem. Very few, in fact, make any effort      to utilize this versatile material, which can be had for      free-and in quantity-almost anywhere. To us      avid recyclers, however, this lack of popularity is a      blessing, because it leaves more for us . . . and I'm      convinced that cardboard is a downright <em>wonderful</em>      substance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TOOLS AND SUPPLIES</strong>    </p>		    <p>      Here are the tools and supplies you'll need to become a      cardboard carpenter: a utility knife with spare blades . .      . an 18" ruler . . . a five-foot length of 1 X 2 to serve      as a straight edge . . . one ordinary pencil and another      with white or yellow lead . . . a screwdriver . . . a 45"      drafting triangle . . . a carpenter's square . . . a roll      of 2"-wide brown paper tape . . . a few large paper clamps      . . . a capped Bic ballpoint pen or some similarly      bluntpointed tool . . . white glue . . . latex paint . . .      and a cutting board made of plywood or heavy cardboard (to      protect your work surface without dulling your knife      blades).    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUILD UP A SUPPLY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before I begin any project, I cut a number of flat      cardboard sheets from large cartons. I use these, rather      than assembled boxes, to construct my projects. The best      sources for the "paper planks" are appliance stores that      sell such items as refrigerators, washers, and dryers.    </p>    <p>      Always get permission before you take any boxes, however      (snooping around the store's rubbish bins at night could      get you an expense paid trip to the nearest police station!      ), and be sure to leave the trash pile at least as neat as      you found it, even though you have to sacrifice some      perfectly useful boxes to serve as catchalls for the      clutter you remove from the best cartons. (You'll probably      run across boxes with two or three rows of corrugation in      the core, but it's best to begin by learning to work with      material made of a single corrugated thickness between two      face veneers. You can check the construction of the      cardboard at any exposed or cut edges that are      perpendicular to the "grain".)    </p>    <p>      Once you've made your selection, cut the boxes' bottoms off      with your utility knife and slice the sides apart. Each      box, then, will produce four separate side panels for you      to take home.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SAMPLE PROJECT</strong>    </p>			    <p>      Probably the easiest way to learn to build with cardboard      is to assemble the flip-top box pictured here, since its      construction involves most of the basic techniques you'll      need for any other cardboard projects. And, of course, the      lowcost, presentable storage container itself will be very      handy.    </p>    <p>      First, to avoid marring your work surface, put the cutting      board on a table, countertop, or workbench. Then select a      couple of the scavenged cardboard sheets large enough for      the project. You'll probably need at least one side from a      refrigerator box to form the body of this little storage      chest . . . but the top and bottom can be cut from smaller      pieces.    </p>    <p>      Now, lay one section of cardboard on the table <em>with its      printed side up.</em> Draw the pattern on this side, so      that-when it's assembled-the <em>outside</em>      of the finished flip-top box will have no advertising      showing. (The white or yellow pencil is used wherever your      lines cross any darkcolored areas on the container.) It's      best to follow this procedure even if you plan to paint      your project . . . because sometimes uneven absorption will      allow the print to show through the paint.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE CUTUP</strong>    </p>			    <p>      After you've reproduced the plan on your sheets (following      the dimensions shown in the accompanying illustration), cut      around each piece with the utility knife. Use your      straightedge to keep the lines true and unwavering. First,      make a light pass with the blade, then follow up with one      or two heavy cuts.    </p>    <p>      When that's done, slice only <em>halfway</em> through the      cardboard along each fold line. The best way to do this is      to tilt your knife back toward you until the lower front      corner of the handle touches the surface of the cardboard,      and then to use that point as a pivot to control the depth      of the cut. (This process can be a bit tricky at first, but      it'll become easy after a little practice.) As before, make      one light cut and then follow with more pressure, being      careful not to cut all the way through the material.    </p>    <p>      Next, use a screwdriver to chisel out the inside face      veneer and the corrugations from the areas indicated in the      drawing ... leaving a single veneer hinge. These are spaces      between two fold lines where the cardboard will have to      turn back 180° . . . either onto itself (1/4" space) or      over an adjoining tab for assembly (3/8" space).    </p>    <p>      Along all the other fold lines (which will require finished      angles of only 90°), use the capped end of the Bic pen      to smooth down the knife cuts. Now, bend the      panels-toward the inside of your future box-along      each fold line . . . creasing it with your hands as you go.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PUT IT ALL TOGETHER</strong>    </p>		    <p>      To assemble your storage chest, take the body section and      lay it flat on the table as shown in the plans, with the      inside to-be facing up. Fold the right-end      panel (the back) and the left-end panel (a side)      180° in upon the other two panels, so that the side      panel overlaps the glue tab on the back (marked "A" in the      drawing). Lift the side panel enough to apply some glue on      the tab beneath it, and put some books on top of the joint      to hold it until it dries.    </p>    <p>      While you're waiting for the adhesive to set, you can      assemble the top of the box. To do so, fold the glue tabs      marked "B" and "C" up 90", then do the same with the panels      marked "D" and "E". Apply some glue to <em>both</em> sides      of "B" and "C", and fold the front panel marked "F" up      against the tabs and "G" down over them. Finally, put a      large paper clamp at each end of the front panel, to hold      it in place until it dries.    </p>    <p>      When the body is ready to be worked with again, square it      up . . . fold the four tabs marked "H" 90° to the      inside place some glue on them . . . drop the bottom piece      in place down through the inside of the box . . . and      weight it down with books until the connection is secure.      Then apply glue to the inside of the body's upper tabs,      marked "I", fold them down flat (180°) inside the box,      and told them in place with large paper clamps while they      dry.    </p>    <p>      When all the glued surfaces have set, case the      <em>side</em> of your ballpoint pen to burnish down the      edges of the panels which were folded 180° . . . to      give the borders a neat appearance. Now, take a 10" piece      of brown paper tape, crease it lengthwise down the center,      wet it, and apply it over the glued corner of the body to      cover the corrugated edge of the side panel.    </p>    <p>      Coat the finished product with any good latex paint (flat      or semi-gloss varieties seem to work best), and then attach      the top's rear panel (marked "J") to the back panel of the      box's body, using either glue or two brass paper fasteners.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DESIGN YOUR OWN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you've become familiar with the basic techniques      involved in cardboard construction, you'll probably come up      with a lot of projects of your own to try. When you set out      to convert those ideas into reality, design the layouts on      paper first. Start with your inside dimensions and then add      enough to allow for the folds. (I generally figure 1/8" for      each 90° bend, 1/4" for 180°, and 3/8" where a      180° bend folds <em>over</em> an adjoining tab.)    </p>		    <p>      If you prefer to finish your containers or furniture with      decorative paper (instead of paint), apply the covering to      the componentsusing wheat paste-when they're flat and      unassembled. In fact, don't even try to trim the paper to      exact size until it's glued down and dry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROJECT IDEAS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Recycled container construction can be used to produce all      sorts of items which need to be custom-sized to fit your      home's own special nooks and crannies . . . must be      lightweight . . . should be able to be folded flat for      storage . . . or don't require the durability of a wood or      metal object.    </p>    <p>      For example, I've turned scrap cardboard into a storage      chest for Christmas decorations . . . a newspaper      collection box . . . under-the bed "drawers" . . . a recipe      file . . . a drawing/artwork carryall . . . moving      containers for special items . . . a pet carrier . . . tool      and shop supply organizers . . . and more!    </p>    <p>      The same material can be used to create wonderful toys for      children (and these can make some <em>dandy</em> Christmas      gifts). Consider building play kitchen appliances, a      climb-in space capsule, big building blocks, or large      dollhouses for the tots on your gift list. Of course, it      may take you a while to become expert enough to tackle      especially complicated projects, but the benefits of      cardboard carpentry are certainly worth the effort. After      all, this useful material-which might otherwise go to      waste-has one big asset that's not found often these      days . . . it's free!    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXPAND YOUR REPERTOIRE</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you've mastered the basic techniques of working with      cardboard, the following sources can provide you with      information on other methods, materials, and supplies.    </p>    <p>      <em>Nomadic Furniture One</em> and Nomadic <em>Furniture      Two</em> by James Hennessey and Victor Papanek (Pantheon      Books, 1973 and 1974, $4.95 each) are both very helpful      volumes.    </p>    <p>      Cardboard projects have appeared in a few magazine      articles, too . . . including "Disposable Icebox for      Picnics" <em>(Popular Mechanics,</em> July 1954) . . .      "Cardboard Chair Sets Up in Five Minutes" <em>(Popular      Science,</em> September 19.52) . . . and "Cardboard      Carpentry" <em>(Family Handyman, No</em> vember 1979).    </p>    <p>      And when you're shopping for decorating supplies, check out      the fol lowing sources: [1] American Printing Equipment and      Supply Company (Dept. TMEN, 42-25 Ninth Street, Long Island      City, New York 11101), which carries plastic coated papers      for bookeovering and bookcovering cloths in five-yard      rolls. These materials come in several colors and embossed      textures-including simulated linen, morocco leather,      skiver, and buckramand are easy to work with. [2] Basic      Crafts Company (Dept. TMEN, 1201 Broadway, New York, New      York 10001) also carries bookcovering cloths and papers.      [3] Dick Blick (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 1287, Galesburg,      Illinois 81401) has colored construction paper in large      sheets, colored kraft paper in sheets and rolls, lettering      stencils of all types, and many press-apply letters.    </p>
