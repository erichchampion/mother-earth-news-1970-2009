    <p>
                <p>      Part III in a series on dairy cow care by mother's      homestead veterinarian;    </p>        <p>      <strong>Randy Kidd</strong>    </p>    <p>      In MOTHER NOS. 70 and 71, I presented "ten commandments" to      help you raise your own healthy backyard dairy cow. And now      that the basic methods of feeding and caring for of Bossie      have been explained, it's time to turn our attention to the      task of safeguarding the "liquid assets" produced by the      bovine boarder.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLEANLINESS IS THE KEY</strong>    </p>        <p>      To insure that your homegrown dairy products are tasty      <em>and</em> safe to eat and drink, you should follow      several simple principles of milk handling. The first (and      most important) rule is to make certain the liquid doesn't      become contaminated after it leaves the mammary gland. The      best way to assure this is to keep the milking equipment      and building scrupulously clean.    </p>    <p>      [1] Maintain a spotless milking area. You might want to      paint the enclosure white, so you'll be better able to      see-and eliminate-fly specks or spots of fecal      matter.    </p>    <p>      [2] Keep strong odors out of the milking and milk storage      areas.    </p>    <p>      [3] Use only sanitized pans, strainers, and bottles.    </p>    <p>      [4] Don't give your dairy animal onions, silage, cabbage,      moldy grains and hay, or any other feed that can impart an      "off" flavor to the milk.    </p>    <p>      [5] Make certain the beast herself is clean. Keep the hair      around and above the mammary gland clipped.    </p>    <p>      [6] Always scrub your hands before you set to work.    </p>    <p>      [7] Clean the udder prior to milking. Use a paper towel      soaked in a disinfectant solution to wash off any mud and      dirt, then throw that towel away. Next, clean each teat in      a dip cup filled with <em>fresh disinfectant</em> solution.      (The containers and cleaning liquids can be purchased from      farm suppliers or feed stores.)    </p>    <p>      [8] Finally, be sure that the milk itself is clean. Always      strip the first three or four streams into a black cup and      swirl the liquid around to look for the small chunks or      clumps that can indicate mastitis (an inflammation or      infection of the mammary gland).    </p>    <p>      <strong>KEEP A READY ROUTINE</strong>    </p>        <p>      There's more than one reason for washing your animals'      udders carefully. Milk flow is brought on by the hormone      oxytocin, the production of which is stimulated by      massaging the udder and performing other premilking      routines that the animal is accustomed to . . . such as      (noisily) scrubbing out the milk pail.    </p>    <p>      It'll take from 45 to 90 seconds after the stimulation      begins to produce a milk flow, and the hormone's effect      lasts only eight minutes. The milking process should thus      be finished within little more than eight minutes after you      wash Bossie's udder.    </p>    <p>      When you're done, dip each teat once again in fresh      disinfectant. This procedure leaves a drop of solution at      the end of the teat canal to help keep out infections.    </p>    <p>      Dairy animals must be milked at least twice a day, allowing      about 12 hours between sessions. If you milked three times      a day, you could likely increase production by 10 to 20%,      but the additional labor and time involved <em>would</em>      have to be weighed against the value of the extra milk    </p>    <p>      <strong>MORE ON MASTITIS</strong>    </p>        <p>      Mastitis can occur in any dairy animal, including goats      (contrary to what many doe owners believe). The disease is      caused by a variety of organisms . . . bacteria, fungi, and      possibly viruses. It can be triggered by something as      seemingly inconsequential as a bump to the udder, which can      lead to inflammation and eventual infection. Cuts, bruises,      cold, dirt, or stress may also leave the udder vulnerable      to the invasion of mastitis-causing mica, organisms.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, proper milking techniques can help      prevent the disease. The cleaner your cow's environment,      the less chance there is of introducing mastitis-causing      organisms into the udder. The last little teat dip in      disinfectant-recommended above-will make it      difficult for such "bugs" to enter.    </p>    <p>      Extra care in the selection of your critters will help      prevent mastitis as well. A cow (or doe) with an udder      that's carried tightly up against the flank (one with      strong suspensory ligaments! will suffer a lot less udder      banging and bruising than will an anim al with a pendulous,      low-slung bag. And the less trauma the wil der endures, the      less chance there will be for infection to occur.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE CMT AND THE SCC</strong>    </p>    <p>      Severe mastitis can be identified by clumps in the milk      (actually fibrous masses of infection-fighting white blood      cells) <em>but</em> evidence of milder cases` isn't always      visible. There's a simple examination, however-called      the California mastitis test (CMT)-that helps bring      any cells present together, to make them detectable in less      advanced cases.    </p>    <p>      The CMT uses a white paddle-shaped device, which has      attached cups, and a blue indicator liquid. A stream of      milk from each teat is collected in a cup, after which a      few drops of the indicator are added. The examiner simply      swirls the two substances together, then tips the paddle      slightly so that the milk slowly runs to one side. If white      cells are present, they'll show up as clumps, easily seen      against the blue color.    </p>    <p>      Another mastitis screening procedure is the somatic cell      count (SCC). Performed by the Dairy Herd Improvement      Association (DHIA), the test provides a count of the      somatic cells-white blood cells and epithelial cells, for      example-present in the milk.    </p>    <p>      An excess of somatic cells in the milk might be an      indication of mastitis. However, some epithelial cells are      continually sloughed off into the milk produced by any      animal, and the "normal" quantity will vary according to      the stage of lactation and the age of the beast. Your      herd's DHIA records should help you determine whether a      critter's cell count is normal or too high.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A CHECK PROGRAM</strong>    </p>        <p>      Take the following steps to keep a close watch for mastitis      in your dairy animals.    </p>    <p>      [1] Swirl the first few streams of milk around in a black      cup every time you milk, to check for evident mastitis.    </p>    <p>      [2] Periodically use the California mastitis test to      uncover any less obvious cases. (A general guideline would      be to perform the CMT once a month for nonproblem herds,      once a week for problem herds, and once a day for problem      individuals.) If your DHIA records provide a somatic cell      count, compare your cows to their norms. When an animal      scores higher, you should assume that she's contracted the      ailment.    </p>    <p>      [3] Once mastitis has been diagnosed, feel the animal's      udder. If it's hot, call the vet immediately. Should the      udder feel only normally warm, though, simply milk the cow      out every two or three hours for a total of 72 hours.      (Discard the milk or-in light cases-feed it to      your pigs.) Many cases of mastitis can be cured without the      use of antibiotics by merely emptying the udder as often as      possible and letting Bossie's immune system work its own      magic. (However, if the repeat CMT is still positive after      three days, call your vet.)    </p>    <p>      You can increase disease resistance in the udder by giving      all cows a two-month layoff between lactations. The      vacation will give their milk-producing systems a chance to      recuperate and regenerate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PREPARING THE MILK FOR CONSUMPTION</strong>    </p>        <p>      You know, then, that your cow is <em>udderly healthy</em> .      . . and she's just given you a bucketful of fresh milk.      What should you do to guarantee that the beverage will be      fresh and tasty for the day's meals?    </p>    <p>      Well, once you've got the liquid into a bottle or pan, cool      it-as rapidly as possible-to 40Â°F . . . to      insure a longer shelf life and a better flavor.    </p>    <p>      After chilling it, you may want to pasteurize the milk.      This process will kill most of the disease-carrying bugs      that could affect humans. There are two ways to go about      the task. One is to heat the milk to 165Â°F for 20      seconds (actually, you just bring it to 165Â°F and then      shut off the burner) .. . the other is to warm the milk to      145Â°F and <em>hold it</em> at that temperature for 30      minutes. Be sure to use stainless steel pans and to stir      the milk constantly with a stainless steel spoon while it's      heating. (Copper, iron, or chipped enamel pots-and      metal thermometers-may give the milk an "off"      flavor.) When the time is up, quickly cool the liquid to      60Â°F, and store it at 40Â°F.    </p>    <p>      Pasteurization and animal testing have greatly reduced the      incidence of brucellosis and tuberculosis in this country,      but it's still wise to exercise caution. Whether you      consume raw or pasteurized milk from your homestead animal,      test the cow (or goat) annually for both diseases.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AND THAT'S NOT ALL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Naturally, in order to keep your dairy cow producing milk      on a regular cycle, it's necessary to breed her every year.      In the accompanying sidebar, I'll explain the method often      used today to guarantee both new offspring and another      year's supply of fresh, wholesome homegrown milk.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Artificial Insemination</strong>    </p>    <p>      Artificial insemination (AT)-the process of      collecting live sperm from a male and introducing them into      a female's reproductive tract at the proper time to produce      offspringwas first researched back in 1783 by a man named      Lazzaro Spallanzani, who conducted experiments with dogs in      order to perfect the technique.    </p>    <p>      The first commercial AI organization in this country didn't      begin operation until 1938-many years after the      practice was instigated in Europe-but today, more      than a <em>third</em> of all dairy calves are conceived by      this method. Goats, dogs, pigs, and horses are also bred by      AI, though not so extensively as are cattle.    </p>    <p>      AI can be <em>your</em> best bet, too, whether your herd is      large or small. For instance, besides profiting from the      relatively low cost involved (compared to the expense of      feeding and maintaining a bull), the would-be breeder      can pick a sire from the best of stock, without having to      consider how far away the male animal may actually be.      Furthermore, many diseases associated with the reproduction      process can be controlled, and often eliminated, by using      AI.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps its greatest advantage, though, is that AI extends      the use of service by superior bulls. A sire that's proved      capable of transmitting desirable traits to his offspring      can thus be mated to <em>thousands</em> of cows.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW IT'S DONE</strong>    </p>    <p>      The semen is selected by using an artificial vagina (a      rigid tube with an inner rubber sleeve that's been warmed      with water and lubricated). The bull is tricked into      mounting a "teaser" animal-usually a steer-and an attendant      directs the bull's penis into the tube and traps the      ejaculate. Sperm is gathered once or twice a week,      depending on the weather and the bull's disposition.    </p>    <p>      A healthy, vigorous bull will produce from 300 million to      two <em>billion</em> sperm cells in each milliliter of a      normal five- to six-milliliter ejaculate. Ten million      active sperm cells are considered an adequate number for      one insemination, and, generally speaking, 70% of the sperm      cells in a healthy ejaculate will be motile.    </p>    <p>      Immediately after collection, both the number of sperm      <em>and</em> their motility are evaluated. Then, depending      on the count of healthy sperm per milliliter, the ejaculate      is diluted to produce the desired concentration of sperm      cells. The diluted semen is placed in small ampules or      straws and is quick-frozen for later use. Special metal      canisters are necessary for storage, since the semen is      kept in a liquid nitrogen refrigerant at temperatures far      below freezing (-320Â°F ). You might be surprised to      learn that calves have been born from sperm which has been      stored this way for over <em>nine years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>IMPREGNATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      When a cow comes into heat, an inseminator ( call your      county extension agent for information on available A1      service) will visit the farm and introduce the semen into      the cow's uterus. He or she will locate the correct      placement by inserting a gloved hand into the animal's      rectum and manipulating the cervix until a catheter can be      gently moved into place through the vagina. Once the      catheter is in position, the operator pushes the plunger on      a syringe to deposit the sperm.    </p>    <p>      The success rate of AI averages about 70%. This ratio of      conceptions to inseminations will vary according to the      bull used and the health of the cow's reproductive tract.    </p>    <p>      Have your vet stop by between 45 and 60 days after the      insemination to palpate the cow for pregnancy . . .      and-at the same time-recommend a good vaccine      and parasite-control program for your herd.    </p>
