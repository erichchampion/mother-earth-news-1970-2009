                    <p>      <strong>The worldwide organization that's called Friends of      the Earth is one of the most effective environmental groups      in existence today. However, although FOE publishes its own      journal</strong> - <strong>the monthly tabloid      titled</strong> <strong>Not</strong> <strong><em>Man      Apart</em></strong> - <strong><em>far</em></strong>      <strong>too few MOTHER readers regularly get a chance      to</strong> <em>see</em> <strong>that publication . . . and      that's why we've arranged to bring you this bimonthly      column, which is prepared by the staff of FOE/NMA.</strong>    </p>    <p>      These are truly odd times for the environmental movement:      Unprecedented bumbles and disasters are being hatched      almost daily in Washington . . . while public support for      environmental protection is growing at never-before-seen      rates. The Reagan administration's emerging policies are      threatening to undo nearly a century of hard-won progress      .. . yet at the same time conservation groups are enjoying      dramatic surges in membership and contributions. In the      light of such developments, perhaps we should take a look      at the Reagan appointees who are-by and      large-responsible for the strengthening of positions      on <em>both sides</em> of the environmental fence.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WATT'S UP AT INTERIOR</strong>    </p>    <p>      The Secretary of the Interior is the chief conservation      officer of the United States. He's responsible for managing      nearly 25% of the nation's lands ... including our national      parks, wildlife refuges, some recreation areas, the outer      continental shelf, and the vast tracts of western acreage      that are controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. For      decades-whether Republicans or Democrats were in      power-our Interior Secretaries have pursued a policy      of protecting the territory under their control.    </p>    <p>      But in James Watt we have a new breed of manager, a man who      believes that the public lands exist to support the      freeenterprise economy of our country . . . as espoused by      his boss, the President. For example, the new Interior      Secretary proposes to turn substantial parts of the      management of national parks over to private interests. He      also wants to "inventory", as he says, public lands for      their mineral content ... expecting us to believe that      corporations intend to spend millions of dollars on such      exploration and then wait happily in the wings until those      resources are "really needed".    </p>    <p>      Other actions that bode ill for our environment include      attempts to open up oil exploration on the continental      shelf (where the majority of our seafood is currently      harvested), a partial dismantling of the agencies that      oversee strip mining, and a drastic curtailment of      government efforts to protect endangered species from      extinction (both in our country and abroad).    </p>    <p>      For these reasons (and others which are being added to the      list daily . . see the Ecoscience column, page 148. for a      more extensive discussion), Mr. Watt has inspired      widespread criticism, which has led to requests from many      groups for his resignation . . . and even to the      circulation of a recall petition, sponsored by Friends of      the Earth, the Sierra Club, and others.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A DENTIST TO EXTRACT ENERGY</strong>    </p>    <p>      All of the skills that James Edwards brought to his new job      as Secretary of Energy resulted from his working as an oral      surgeon and later serving as governor of South Carolina.      He's been a relatively quiet administrator so far . . .      although he did suggest-in a controversial interview      published by his hometown paper-that the antinuclear      movement includes "subversive" elements, "manipulated" by      unnamed sinister forces that "want to bring this country to      its knees". When pressed for specifics, Secretary Edwards      would not elaborate. He has also stated that nuclear power      is "the cleanest, safest. and cheapest" source of      electricity available ... which, particularly with respect      to "cheapest", shows an astonishing ignorance of dozens      upon dozens of recent analyses from sources as diverse as      Wall Street and the government itself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A LOGGER TO DEFEND THE FORESTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      For years, conservation-minded critics of the U.S.      Forest Service have worried that trees are being cut more      rapidly than they're being replaced in our national      forests. However, John Crowell, the new Agriculture      Department official in charge of the national forests,      wants to <em>double the</em> amount of timber cut from      those woodlands . . . just as he did when he was General      Counsel of the Louisiana Pacific Lumber Company.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE LIST GOES ON</strong>    </p>    <p>      Anne Gorsuch, Mr. Reagan's appointee to direct the      Environmental Protection Agency, has employed a covey of      big-business lawyers to help run her office. In an early      move, Ms. Gorsuch's EPA reversed gears on the cleanup of      chemical dump sites. What's more, her newly hired head of      the agency's strip-mining office spent time (on his      previous job in Ohio) trying to get the stripmining control      law declared unconstitutional! (He lost that battle, so now      he must enforce the law he fought.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT'S A PERSON TO DO?</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the face of such an obvious lack of concern for-or      understanding of-our environmental dilemmas, should      we just give up in disgust? Not at all! As bleak as the      scene in Washington appears to be, there are plenty of good      signs elsewhere. Folks across the country have been moved      by the current turn of events, and they're joining      environmental groups in droves .. so that their voices can      be heard. In the recent New Jersey primary election, for      example, conservation-minded candidates won four out of      four nominations for the state legislature. Environ      mentalists in the House of Representatives are regaining a      bit of their courage, too, and should put up a good battle      against the legislative assaults that the administration      and its allies promise to mount against environmental      causes.    </p>    <p>      Still, the immediate future looks as if it'll hold its      share of challenges. Hence, it's more important than ever      that you let your representatives know just what you think.      Secretary Watt continually states that the majority of U.S.      citizens support him, and that those who protest his      actions are simply a vocal minority. Don't leave any doubt      which side you're on!    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SHORT ENERGY QUIZ</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's a test that almost no one-including many      people in high places-can get right. List, in      descending order, the relative contributions of the      following sources of energy (given alphabetically here) to      our nation's power consumption: coal, gas, hydro, nuclear,      and oil. Ready? The winner by a wide margin is coal, which      supplies nearly half of the country's electrical capacity.      Then-in declining order-we have gas, hydro,      nuclear, and oil.    </p>    <p>      We mention this to give you another version of the rosy      picture still being painted by many proponents of nuclear      energy. The fact is that atomic power's      contribution-to our energy needs slipped last year      (from about 12% to 10%) and would have come in last if oil      hadn't slipped even further.    </p>    <p>      However, figures like these fail to consider conservation,      which-in its own way-has contributed at least      as much to solving our energy problems as has nuclear power      or oil. In fact, despite the pronouncements of the      supply-side energy types, conservation is today's most      economical way of augmenting future supplies of energy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WELCOME BACK</strong>    </p>    <p>      We're exceedingly pleased to be offering this column to      readers of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) .
