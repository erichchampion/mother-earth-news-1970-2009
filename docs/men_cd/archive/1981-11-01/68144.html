                    <h5 id="byline">      by William R. Carr    </h5>        <p>      <em>Nonreturnable beverage cans are a blight on the land!      But the metal they contain is also a valuable resource . .      .</em> and <em>a source of income for many people. In the      paragraphs that follow, Bill Carr describes a device that      can help recycle throwaway containers by making them easier      to handle. However, before you give Bill's device a try,      heed a word of warning from MOTHER: Fingers, as well as      cans, could be slammed in this compactor! Therefore, we      recommend that you</em> never <em>let a child use it      without close supervision . . . and then only after you're      sure that he or she understands and practices appropriate      safety procedures.</em>    </p>    <p>      When our 70-pound boy up and collected <em>several hundred      pounds</em> of discarded aluminum cans, we were faced with      a problem. How I wondered would we <em>store</em> the heap      of containers until we could get to a recycling center?      Well, my son Jim and I tried various ways of compacting the      metal money makers the between-the-hands crush, the hammer      and anvil smash, and the concentrated footstomp among      others but all those techniques turned out to require      greater strength and weight than Jim could muster. We      needed a more convenient method . . . and hoped to find one      that would be fun for Jim as well as effective.    </p>    <p>      Then a friend came up with the basic idea that I developed      into what I call the One-Step, Three-Can Slam . . . an      easily made machine that can be used by children      <em>or</em> adults to crush cans to a 3/4" thickness for      efficient storage and transport.    </p>    <p>      My design incorporates a small (Jimmy sized) workbench at      one end, but the working parts could just as well fit into      a table, bar, bench, or box. I'm sure that MOTHER's readers      will be able to look at the accompanying illustration and      make their own slammers . . . to help remove litter from      the highways and put <em>cash</em> in their pockets!    </p>
