                <p>      <em>The "ruby of the bog" will add a burst of color and a      bundle of flavor to your holiday fare.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Eva Zlab    </h5>        <p>      Early autumn, when the often warm and hazy days are      followed by cool nights and frosty morn ings, heralds the      end of the har vest season. And a bit later, as the trees      blaze into a brilliant display of color, na ture puts its      finishing touches on the plump crimson berries in local      cranberry bogs. In our household, the appearance of the      bright berries-from late September and on through the      drowsy Indian summer days of October and November-is      the signal to don old clothing, pull on water proof      galoshes, grab some buckets, and embark on our annual      cranberry-picking outing <em>(and</em> begin dreaming of      the mouth watering meals that the little ruby fruits will      contribute so much to).    </p>    <p>      This autumn excursion-which has become a regular      tradition in our family-is actually just a      continuation of a custom once practiced by our forebears.      The cranberry has played a rich part in this country's      heritage. The tart fruit was an important ingredient in      pemmican, the "convenience food" carried by many native      Americans, and its juice was used as a dye for clothing and      blankets. Several tribes also made cranberry poultices,      with which to draw venom from poisoned-arrow wounds. In      addition, the fruit was sometimes offered as a symbol of      peace (it's believed that the Indians presented the      Pilgrims with gifts of cranberries).    </p>    <p>      And European settlers were quick to recognize the excellent      qualities of the berry. Water-packed barrels of the fruit      (which we now know to be rich in vitamin C) were taken on      board oceangoing ships to help prevent scurvy. Early      colonists also gave the cranberry its common name: It seems      that they thought the delicate pink blossoms resembled the      nodding heads of cranes . . . and "crane berry" was later      shortened to the moniker we use today.    </p>    <p>      Foraging for wild cranberries continued to be a common      autumn activity as the Pilgrim settlements grew into      thriving towns. The fruits began to ripen at the end of the      growing season, and-as a celebration of the      harvest-whole communities would assemble at peat bogs      and gather the crimson fruit as one of the last social      events before winter's chill set in for good. (In fact,      cranberry picking was so popular that many villages      actually levied a fine on anyone who was caught harvesting      the fruit before the season was officially open!)    </p>    <p>      Nowadays, this member of the Ericaceae (heath) family is      cultivated-in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Wisconsin,      Oregon, and Washington-in peat swamps which have been      drained of water, leveled, spread with a thin layer of      sand, and planted with cuttings of the cranberry vine.      However, you can recapture the festive atmosphere of early      pioneer days by foraging for <em>wild</em>      cranberries-as our family does-and using your      harvest of the colorful crop to create some downright deli      cious additions to holiday meals!    </p>    <p>      The large American cranberry <em>(Vaccinium      macrocarpon)</em> grows wild throughout the northeastern      United States and westward to Minnesota and Arkansas. Here      on the West Coast, though. the Pacific cran berry (V.      oxycoccus) is more common in the wild. Although it's      smaller than the domesticated variety, we think the      forageable fruit has an especially delightful tangy flavor.      You can find the red or mottled red-and-white berries of      this low shrublike creeping plant in areas with acid soil .      . including sphagnum moss bogs and wet, woody river banks.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Be certain, of course, to consult a      wild foods guide or to accompany an experienced cranberry      hunter on foraging expeditions.]</em> And once you've      collected a bucketful of the ruby beauties (or, if      necessary, <em>bought</em> a supply of them), try the      following recipes ... to fill your kitchen with a bonanza      of cranberry creations!    </p>    <h3>      CRANBERRY-HONEY SAUCE    </h3>    <p>      This whole-cranberry sauce is a favorite treat at our      supper table year round, and is sure to add cheer to any      family feast. Start by combining 1-1/2 cups of mild honey      and 1/2 cup of water in a saucepan. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:      MOM's recipe testers found this sauce to be quite sweet. If      you're partial to a tarter flavor, simply use less honey      (and more water) until you've achieved the desired      taste.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Next, wash and pick over 4 cups (1 pound) of fresh      cranberries (discard any green or rotten specimens, but      keep in mind that the color differences of ripe berries,      ranging from mottled red and white to a dark ruby hue,      often indicate the variety-not the age-of the      fruit) and add them to the honey syrup.    </p>    <p>      Bring the uncovered mixture to a boil and simmer it,      without stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes . . . until the      skins of the berries pop (you'll actually be able to hear      the miniature explosions) and the sauce thickens. Then,      using a large spoon, skim off any froth that formed during      the boiling process, pour the cranberries into a serving      dish (we always use a cutglass bowl so that the scarlet      color will shimmer through the facets), and chill the      condiment until it's firm. Just before setting it on the      table, sprinkle a tablespoon of grated orange rind over the      surface.    </p>    <p>      This recipe makes about a quart of sauce, but you'll want      to cook up enough to use in other recipes, too. (You can      preserve any surplus by spooning it into hot sterilized      canning jars, sealing the containers, and processing them      for 10 minutes in a boiling water bath.)    </p>    <h3>      CRANBERRY CRÊPES    </h3>    <p>      Not many folks can resist the delicate flavor of a      crêpe dessert, and this one will have your crowd      begging for more To prepare 14 to 16 of the French      pancakes, sift together-into a large bowl-1 cup      of whole wheat pastry flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder,      and 1 teaspoon of salt. Put the mixture aside while you      combine 4 beaten eggs, 1-1/3 cups of milk, and 2/3 cup of      water. Then make a well in the dry ingredients, pour in the      liquid, and stir the mix until the batter is smooth (it      will be quite thin).    </p>    <p>      Next, heat 1 tablespoon of unrefined oil in a 5" skillet      and add a small quantity of batter, tilting the pan so that      the mixture forms a thin coating over the bottom. Cook the      crepe over moderate heat until it's browned (one minute      should be plenty), flip the pancake, and briefly cook the      other side. Turn the finished crepe out onto a toweldraped      baking sheet, cover it with another tea cloth so that it'll      retain its moisture, and place the tray in a warm      (200°F) oven while you continue cooking the rest of the      batter. Prepare each crepe in the same manner. always      remembering to add one tablespoon of oil to the skillet      before pouring in the batter.    </p>    <p>      To make the filling, add 1/4 cup of butter to 2 cups of      cranberry sauce, and melt the concoction over medium heat.      Then dollop several tablespoons of the pipinghot sweet onto      each crêpe, and roll the pancake into the      characteristic cylindrical shape. Serve the dessert      garnished with whipped cream or yogurt topped with fresh,      sliced cranberries ... or-for an especially dramatic      effect-pour a bit of brandy over <em>ungarnished</em>      filled crepes and touch a match to the spirits!    </p>    <h3>      APPLE-CRANBERRY SALAD    </h3>    <p>      This easy-to-make salad can serve as a cool companion to a      hot 'n' hearty holiday meal. To prepare the dish, combine 3      cups of sliced apples (leave the skins on for added color),      1 cup of finely chopped walnuts, and 1/2 cup of minced      celery. Set the mixture aside while you stir together 3/4      cup of yogurt, 1/4 cup of chopped raw cranberries, 2      tablespoons of mild honey, 1 teaspoon of salt, and the      juice of half a lemon. Then simply blend this dressing with      the other ingredients and serve the salad on a bed of fresh      lettuce or spinach.    </p>    <h3>      CRAN-NOG    </h3>    <p>      The holidays wouldn't be complete without a bit of eggnog .      . . and the bog berry can help you produce a pleasant      variation to the traditional beverage. Beat 2 egg yolks      until they're light and frothy, and slowly add 1 cup of      milk (or cream) and 1/2 cup of <em>strained</em> cranberry      sauce (use a food mill, or a strainer and a large spoon, to      eliminate the skins). Next, whip the whites of 4 eggs until      they form soft peaks . . . add 1 tablespoon of mild honey      and teat the mixture until it's stiff. Then gently fold the      egg whites into the liquid ingredients, serve up the      colorful foaming thirst quencher in frosted mugs, and      sprinkle each of the four portions with freshly ground      nutmeg.    </p>    <p>      I hope your family will not only welcome these new      additions to the customary holiday tare, but also      find-as my brood has-that there's no better way      to capture a bit of the festive spirit of yesterday than to      tramp through the woods on a crisp autumn morning . . . in      search of the wild cranberry!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE.'
