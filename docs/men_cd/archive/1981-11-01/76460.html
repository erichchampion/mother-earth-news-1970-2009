                    <p>      <em>If</em> you now operate, or have ever operated, a      successful home business that was inspired by an article      you read in MOTHER, tell us (in about 500 words) when and      where-and with how much "seed money" you started your      venture. Because if your story can be fitted into an      upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES, you'll      receive [1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that you      helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy      <em>and</em> [2] a free two-year new or renewal      subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.    </p>    <p>      When my son Randy read Jo Frohbieter Mueller's article,      "Stained Glass" (MOTHER NO. 48, page 74), he rapidly      developed a keen interest in the art form. Beginning by      traveling to a studio 25 miles away for private lessons, he      brought home books, equipment, and sheets of stained glass      His initial investment was $70, of which $50 went for tools      and $20 for glass.    </p>    <p>      Randy's first effort was a crude but identifiable butterfly      given as a Mother's Day gift. Later, his mom's <em>birthday      was</em> brightened by a gaily colored glass pattern which      now hangs in the laving room window.    </p>        <p>      Our son was learning by trial and error-and actually      <em>breaking more</em> glass than he used-when      something happened that changed his hobby into a career. He      was invited to teach the art at the local community      college. Well, Randy sat down and read all the books he had      borrowed but laid aside in his eagerness to get to work.      Then he went on to consume every volume on the subject in      the public library. Finally, he traveled to a large supply      house where experts in the craft gave him      <em>additional</em> help and information. After that trip,      his glass creations were made more rapidly and became much      larger and more beautiful. <em>And</em> they began selling!    </p>    <p>      Now, Randy's been established in his own studio, "Glass of      Past", for nearly a year . . . where he creates, sells, and      teaches the art he loves. His opening inventory of $2,500      has already increased to $7,000, and he has hired an      assistant <em>and has</em> rented space to two other      craftspersons. Randy charges $30 to $50 per square foot for      his finished pieces and has recently completed an order for      $4,000 worth of windows.    </p>    <p>      You can contact our son, the glass artist, at this address:      Randy Plowe Glass of Past, Dept. TMEN, 221 South James,      Ludington, Michigan 49431.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Ron Plowe<br />      Ludington, Mich.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      After two very poor olive harvests cut into the spending      money we'd been able to earn from our little farm over here      in Greece, I was happy to read (in MOTHER NO. 62, on page      24) Carol Clivio's article, "Fashions From Old Ties" which      describes and illustrates the attractive items she creates      out of the castoff pieces of silk. With Carol's ideas in      mind, I was able to hatch my own little business.    </p>    <p>      My available horde of scraps consisted not of silk ties,      but of wool vests and pullovers that have been too severely      moth-chewed to be of any conventional use. 1 collect the      garments, dozens at a time, by posting signs in bakeries,      where the Northern Grecian islanders see them and respond      willingly. Then I unravel the sweaters and remake the yarn      into caps, waistcoats, and jackets in the same styles as      those worn in ancient Greece! I also add a little extra      touch, when preparing each of these newtold items for sale,      by including a hand-calligraphed description of the      article ... in French, German, English, and Greek.    </p>    <p>      So far I've had to make no investment in my business (other      than four to five hours a week of my time). The sweaters I      unravel and knit again are free, and I already owned all      the knitting needles and crochet hooks I could possibly use      when 1 began this venture. There isn't even any      out-of-pocket transportation cost: My husband and I load      the garments aboard the handmade sailboat we've had for 13      years and let the wind carry us to market . . . or, to      visit neighboring villages on our own island, I simply ride      my bike.    </p>    <p>      The profit isn't great-about $150 a monthbut there's no      overhead and what we do earn makes it possible for us to      afford the books and gadgets we read about in THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS"!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Gail Jacobson<br />      Volos, Greece</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Maine winters can be bitter cold, but-as a born      DownEaster-I wouldn't live anywhere else! However, to      stay here and survive economically, a homesteader has to be      either rather wealthy or extremely resourceful. (My family      and I have always been the latter of the two!)    </p>    <p>      During the winter we plan for busier seasons . . . making      lists of what to plant, repair, replace, or build. And we      search and scheme for ways to make an extra dollar. Well,      while "sharpening our brains" this past year-having      ingested "Wood-Burner Restoration" in MOTHER NO. 59, page      25, which set us thinking about stove      accessories-Bill and I ran across an article on      woodbox designs . . . and we knew we'd found the idea we      were after.    </p>    <p>      That's how we started building firewood storage chests.      Bill handcrafts the attractive fuel holders, and I decorate      them with vegetable dyes and stains.    </p>    <p>      Our original investment was approximately $58: $30 for      wood, $8.00 for screws and hardware, and about $20 in      advertising and marketing costs. Now, our creations sell      for $100+, depending on the model and the shipping cost . .      and our earnings range between $700 and $1,400 a week.      We're really quite astonished!    </p>    <p>      If you would like further information, please write.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Bill Eaton & Helen Rogers<br />      Blue Hill Box Company<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      Rt.1, Box 224<br />      Orrington, Maine 04474</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      After reading "How to Make Tied Comforters and Quilts" in      MOTHER NO. 31 (page 62), my wife got bitten by the quilting      bug, and our lives haven't been the same since. She started      buy ing craft magazines and began quilting by squares. As      we knew it would, the day arrived when she had enough units      to make a complete quilt . . . and that meant we had to      obtain a quilting frame. The device that was featured in      MOTHER's article required at least two people to manipulate      it, though, so we kept looking until we found a lightweight      frame that could be handled by a single person.    </p>    <p>      That purchase got us started in not one but two businesses.      Since my wife had been asked to teach a course in quilting      for a local high school's community education department,      we thought it made sense to manufacture and sell lap frames      to the students . . . along with kits to make their first      squares. Some of the folks in the class just made pillows      or wall hangings, but others went on to complete fullsized      quilt tops, and they needed-you guessed      it-quilting frames. So supplying those pieces of      equipment became our second business.    </p>    <p>      We sold, in all, ten lap frames and 18 quilting frames. Our      expenses totaled $1,212.63 for lumber, nuts and bolts,      ratchets and pawls, shipping boxes, and printing. Our total      profit, including my wife's salary for teaching the class,      came to $1,661.88 in a little over a year of parttime work.    </p>    <p>      And guess what, folks? We plan to do it again ... with a      little difference. Next time we're going to sell ratchets,      pawls, and plans for quilting frames, while continuing to      market our fully assembled lap frames. So if you're a      little bit handy and interested in building a quality      quilting frame, just let me know. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:</em>      Quilting enthusiasts will enjoy the article on page 86.]    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>T.L. "Les" Bourland<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      305 S. Seguin<br />      Converse, Tex. 78109<br />      5121658-2892</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      About a year and a half ago-after undergoing      surgery-I was advised by my doctor to take it easy      for several months. As a result, I-was forced to find      a way to keep food on the table (and to keep myself      occupied) that required less physical exertion than did my      "old" equipment overhaul job. Remembering all the      successful Bootstrap Businesses discussed in THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS', I started thumbing through my collection of      back issues. James A. Lee's letter in MOTHER NO. 52 (page      130) set me to wondering what kinds of skills and tools I      already had that could help me bring in some income.    </p>    <p>      I had worked as a locksmith in my younger years, and that      seemed to me to be a good occupation to go back to . . .      but in a less structured way than before. The local smith      enthusiastically accepted my offer to fit new keys to      closed padlocks on a contract basis: He was too busy to get      around to that particular task himself, and he had      <em>hundreds of</em> locks just waiting for my attention.    </p>    <p>      This good man also agreed to provide pickup and delivery to      my house, supply me with key blanks, and pay me-in      cash-on each visit. Therefore, my "investment"      consisted of my MOTHER subscription and my free time .. .      and the resulting income was better than what I had been      making at my commercial job before the operation! What's      more, the locksmithing enterprise had side benefits that      were especially valuable to a convalescent. I was able to      choose the hours I worked, could take oft and sit in the      sun if I wished to, and didn't have to ask for days off if      I felt like taking a short trip.    </p>    <p>      Now, I'm back at a regular full-time job-In      automation but I still do part-time "ghost" key      lmpressioning for the local locksmith ... and that sideline      occupation, which takes only five or six hours a week,      increased my net income last year by more than 10%. In      addition, I'm write Ing a paper, about the philosophy of      making keys by the impression method, that I hope to have      accepted by one of the locksmithing publications in the      States!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Samuel Shimshoni<br />      Hadera, Israel</strong></em>    </p>
