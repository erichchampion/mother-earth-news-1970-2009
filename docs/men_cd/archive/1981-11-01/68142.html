                <h5 id="byline">by      Randy Kidd    </h5>        <p>      "SOLD" bellowed the auctioneer, "to the man in the blue      jacket for $4.00. And <em>that,</em> sir, is one fine      bargain."    </p>    <p>      I was the guy in the blue jacket, and I'm glad to say that      the item I purchased <em>was</em> a pretty fair buy. For my      $4.00 I got a used-but perfectly      serviceable-pitch fork . . . a quality tool that      would have cost me $15 to $18 in a store.    </p>    <p>      And there's no reason why anyone else couldn't duplicate      (or better) my luck. The next time you decide to buy almost      any kind of homestead equipment whether it be a set of      dishes, a cookstove, a rocking chair, or a pickup      truck-try visiting a local farm auction . . . you      might well latch on to a really first-rate bargain.    </p>    <p>      Over the past year, by simply raising a hand or cocking an      eyebrow so the auctioneer could see it, members of my      family have purchased two large rugs, three pitchforks, an      axe, an oak pie safe, two chests of drawers, a chair, an      oak table, six boxes of canning jars, a lamp, and a scythe      . . . and not <em>one</em> of our finds us more than $5.00!    </p>    <p>      'Furthermore, while it's true that all merchandise was      secondhand (some of it even required quite a bit of fixing      up), everything we've purchased has been potentially      usable. And when you consider that we paid much less than      half the retail price for each item, you'll understand why      I feel that a farm auction can be a shopper's paradise. In      addition, spending a day matching wits with other bidders      <em>(and</em> with the auctioneer) is far more entertaining      than huddling in front of the TV . . . and the chili dogs      and made-fromscratch pecan pies served up by the      church ladies who run the refresh- stand are (nearly) as      good as my wife's :re's home cooking.    </p>    <p>      If f you don't know what you're doing, however, you can      drive away from your must farm auction with a truckload of      trash, and you might even pay more for an old article than      you would to purchase the same item new in a store. Also,      there's a real danger of catching "auction fever"-an      uncontrollable urge to pay too much for something you don't      really want or need-as a result of get ting caught up      in the excitement of the Moment.    </p>    <p>      Fear not, though, because I'm a veterauctiongoer (who's      already <strong><em>made</em></strong> all of those      mistakes!), and I've decided to share some of my      hard-earned knowledge by explaining a few of the terms I      you'll hear at such an event . . . and by listing a      selection of hints that'll help the novice bargain hunter      keep a tight grip his or her pocketbook and go home, with a      bonanza of budget-priced goodies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MASTERING THE LINGO</strong>    </p>    <p>      Make most organized activities, auctons have a peculiar set      of terms that the beginner should become acquainted with.      ("Auction" itself is derived from the Latin word      <em>auctionem . . . a</em> process which Roman soldiers      bought captured booty on the battlefield by topping to each      other's offers for the plunder.) Once you've cracked the      code, you'll be able to follow the action with a minimum      offuss.    </p>            <p>      A <em>bid is</em> the amount that you offer to pay for the      merchandise . . . and <em>increments</em> are the jumps in      price-there's usually a minimum-by which that      sum increases. <em>Opening the bid</em> refers to the sum      at which the offers start, and just how high that initial      bid should be is often a source of great debate among      auction buffs. Some folks prefer to open low, hoping      that-with luck-buyer interest will be minimal      and they'll waltz away with the object for a song. Other      peopleespecially those who are really keen on owning a      particular item-will start a little high . . . with      the intent of discouraging rival buyers. Still another      group believes it's most effective not to bid at all until      the action slows down. You'll just have to work out your      personal auction strategy as you gain experience.    </p>    <p>      A <em>lot is</em> a number of pieces that are sold as a      unit, such as a set of dishes or a matched pair of chairs.      <em>Knocked down is</em> the auctioneer's term for "sold":      for example, "That table was knocked down at $15." A      <em>reserve is</em> the lowest price that can be accepted      for an article. While most farm auctions will not include a      great number of reserve items, an expensive piece of farm      machinery or the like may have a reserve price . . . and a      conscientious auctioneer will generally tell you whether      that condition exists before the bidding starts. As is is      selfexplanatory: It means that you're buying the object      nicks, cracks, burnt-out motor, and all.    </p>    <p>      Many auctions assign <em>buyer's numbers.</em> To obtain      one, you simply register with the event's secretary, and he      or she will give you a card with a number that's recorded      each time you bid in an item. This practice simplifies      bookkeeping, since the secretary can then run a tab for      your purchases, and you can settle up your bill when you      leave. Buyer's numbers also provide bidders with a certain      anonymity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HELPFUL HINTS</strong> <strong>FOR PENNY      PINCHERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      While you're learning "auctionese", you'll also be gaining      assurance in your ability to recognize, and bid on,      bargains. My auctioneer friend, Colonel Archie Ringgenberg,      and I have compiled a list of tips that'll help a novice      avoid misunderstandings and expensive mistakes.    </p>    <p>      [1] Read the sale bills-which are ads in local      newspapers, or flyers that describe the merchandise being      offeredbefore the auction. By doing so, you'll know which      things you're interested in and be able to check their      retail prices. At the same time, you should note the terms      of the sale and work out your own financial arrangements.      Many auctions demand cash, and others will accept checks      drawn only on local banks . . . before you can remove your      purchases.    </p>    <p>      [2] Thoroughly inspect any merchandise you want to bid on      prior to the opening of the auction. Arrive early enough      (or attend the preview day if the goods are exhibited to      the public beforehand) to pore over the loot. You should,      for example, plug in electrical appliances to see if they      work . . . crank the handles of mechanical item to make      sure the gears aren't frozen . . . and check bureaus or      chests for missing or mismatched pull::    </p>    <p>      [3] Make a list of the items you want tit and stick to it      to avoid compulsive biting. Many auctions place convenient      little numbered stickers on each article or lot, and these      are announced as the ob jects are put up for sale. Jot down      the numbers of any goods you're interests interested in,      with a brief description of each and- this point is      crucial-the maxima maximum you're willing to pay for      the privilege of owning it. (My buddy Colonel Arch such a      master at getting his auction to relax that most folks dot      even notice the pain as their money wings its way out of      their wallets!)    </p>    <p>      [4] Find out what an object's worth. . you've done your      homework, you won't ' get so carried away that you pay more      for a broken-handled pitchfork than you would for a new      one. On the other hand don't let the fact that an article      is used affect your judgment. You can find real bargains in      merchandise whose or fault is that its owner no longer      needs Keep in mind the old adage: One person's trash is      another's treasure.    </p>    <p>      [5] Know how you're bidding. Suppo there are four chairs in      a row: Is the attioneer selling them one at a time or four      at once? If the sale is announced one money, you're bidding      on all fore , chairs. Tames the money means, on the, other      hand, that you're bidding the price of one chair, and if      the lot is knock, . down to you, you'll get all four chairs      . four tunes your final bid. Choice chairs means that your      winning bid with buy you first pick among the four. (Mc      auctioneers will then let you-or anyone else in the      audience-take any or all . the remaining chairs for      the same price If there's no interest, the bidding star      anew.)    </p>    <p>      [6] Be sure you understand the spiel While a good      auctioneer chants or sing songs, he or she is telling you      what's going sold and how, plus both the current bid and      the price that's being sought Listen carefully until you're      certain you're following the action. It's a shock, for      instance, to find out you bought a hammer for $12.50 when      you thought the bid was $2.50.    </p>    <p>      [7] Stop the show if you have a ques tion. If you don't      know which box of nail for example, is being sold-or      if you thought you were offering $10 for all four chairs      and it's a "times the money" -halt the proceedings and      explain. honest auctioneer will either go back the previous      bidder in such a case open the bidding again.    </p>    <p>      [8] Secure your goods. As soon as the auctioneer says      "sold" and hands over the merchandise, it's your      responsibili ty One of the biggest problems at auc- tions      is thievery. Be forewarned: Watch your loot or lock it up.    </p>    <p>      [9] If you go with friends, stay together and      decide-in advance-who'll do the bidding on      which items. Despite the fact that we understand this rule,      my wife and I invariably bid against each other, at least      once during each auction. It can be pretty embarrassing to      realize that the "stubborn pest" in the back who keeps      topping your offer is your spouse    </p>    <p>      [10] Watch your hands. You've likely heard the horror      stories <em>about auction iongo</em> who were waving at      friends and suddenly found themselves the proud owners of,      for instance, a moosehead. While some such tales are so old      they ought to have whiskers, it is probably safest to      control your hand movements until an auctioneer becomes      familiar with your bidding mannerisms.    </p>    <p>      [11] Drive a truck. As I mentioned before, your new      property is your responsibility ... and auctions often      aren't equipped to hold the merchandise until you can pick      it up. If you have plenty of room to stash and transport      your goods, you'll also avoid paying hauling charges, which      can add considerably to your "bargain" prices (it's a good      <em>idea, too.</em> to pack along a couple of folding      chairs in the pickup before you set out . . . just in case      there's no seating available when you get to the sale      location.)    </p>    <p>      [12] Enjoy the show. Sample the refreshments and chuckle      over the jokes. Above all, relax and <em>don't</em> allow      yourself to get so uptight that you bid against someone      just to keep him or her from obtaining an item you can't      use anyway.    </p>    <p>      Farm auctions are far more than just means of selling      merchandise. They're social gatherings . . . complete with      hot coffee, chili dogs, homemade pies, and friendly      conversation. There's no better place to spend a leisurely      day in the country-or to get an education in Old time      comparative shopping-than at a rural auction ... and,      <em>while you're</em> learning, you just may walk away with      the "bargain of a lifetime"!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If Randy Kidd's tips for the novice      bargain hunter hare whetted your appetite for farm sales,      you'll want to read</em> Auction!
