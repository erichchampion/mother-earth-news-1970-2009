                <p>      <strong>This holiday season, you can establish a living      tradition that will endure for generations.</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by     Millie Halpern    </h5>    <p>      In the restful aftermath of the holidays that sets in      toward the end of December, a person can walk through just      about any neighborhood and see dozens of bedraggled "used"      Christmas trees dumped beside the road to await trash      collectors. A custom that was originally meant to provide a      reminder of the sleeping promise of spring in the dead of      winter has now become yet another symbol of our throw-away      society.    </p>        <p>      <em>To replant Your Christmas</em> <em>tree . .      .<br /></em> <em>[1] dig a hole that's about 1-1/2 times      larger than the root mass and gently lower the sapling into      place. (If your area has early freezes, you may have to dig      the hole a few weeks before the holidays, store the dirt      indoors, and fill the hole with straw until planting      time.)<br />      [2] Remove the nails from the burlap bag and loosen that      cloth to give the tree's roots some "breathing room".<br />      [3] Fill the hole with a portion of the dirt that was      removed, and . . .</em>    </p>    <p>      However, you can avoid such waste by purchasing a      <em>living</em> tree ... one with its roots intact in a      burlap-wrapped ball of earth. Live evergreens not only      remain beautiful throughout the festive season (unlike cut      trees, which tend to dry out rapidly), but can be      <em>replanted once</em> they've served their holiday      function. In that way, you'll create a permanent, living      reminder of one of the year's most joyful family occasions      . . . and improve the value of your property, establish a      new windbreak, or provide some welcome summer shade in the      process.    </p>        <p>      use the remaining soil to shape<br /> a small mound around the      edge<br /> of the hole. Then dig a 1- to 2"<br />-wide ditch just      inside that dike.    </p>    <p>      If the transplant is to be successful, though, certain      guidelines will have to be followed ... and these "rules"      start to come into play as soon as you visit the Christmas      tree lot or nursery. Most horticulturists agree that fir,      spruce, and pine are all good candidates for post-holiday      planting. Actually, almost any variety of tree-as      long as its roots are wrapped in burlap-will adapt      well to transplantation . . . except hemlocks.    </p>    <p>      Choose a healthy specimen with long, full branches and a      large earth ball that's not frozen . . . and expect to pay      $35 to $40 (or more in large cities) for a four- or      five-foot tree. Once you've brought home your handsome      selection, you'll need to "break it in" by leaving it in a      cool, slightly damp area (such as a garage or basement) for      three or four days to lessen the shock of the transition      from outdoors to in. During this interim period, keep the      root ball covered with straw, peat moss, or an old blanket.    </p>    <p>      When you carry the tree indoors, stand it in a large      washtub (or similar container) and pack sawdust, peat moss,      or even shredded newspapers around the trunk to help hold      it upright. An old cloth draped over the earth ball will      help the roots retain moisture. (To hide the tub and its      contents, simply drape a decorative tree skirt over and      around it.)    </p>        <p>      Mulch the tree with straw,<br /> and give it its first watering<br />      by filling the "moat" three times.    </p>    <p>      Most gardening authorities advise that you keep your living      evergreen in the house for only a week to ten days . . .      certainly no more than two weeks. Try to place it near a      window and away from the warm, dry air escaping from heat      vents, fireplaces, and woodstoves. Most of the plant's      roots will be close to the top of the earth ball, so be      sure to keep that area moist at all times: An average-sized      tree will require about one quart of water a day while it's      indoors. You can trim a live evergreen with any sort of      decorations you'd like . . . but you might want to use      electric lights sparingly, since the heat generated by even      tiny bulbs will tend to dry out a conifer's needles.    </p>    <p>      Finally, when you want to move the greenery out of the      living room after Christmas, it's a good idea to give it      <em>another transitional</em> stay in the garage before      transplanting. Once the evergreen is ready to brave the      outdoors again, be sure your chosen planting site is far      enough from buildings and other trees to allow for future      growth. Then follow the simple directions detailed in the      accompanying photos.    </p>    <p>      If your Christmas tree is carefully planted and cared for,      you can expect it to begin an annual tradition that will      continue to beautify your land in the years to come and      serve as a happy reminder of past holiday celebrations.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: More Christmas</em> tree <em>ideas      (including</em> tips <em>on both decorating and</em>      creating <em>them!) can be found in this issue.
