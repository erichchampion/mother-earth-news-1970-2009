                <p>      You can keep your own chain saw cutting fast and true with      either of these . . .    </p>            <p>      The introduction to the chapter on how to sharpen chain      saws in Barnacle Parp's <em>Chain Saw</em> Guide (see the      editor's note on the following page for access information)      includes an anecdote about the author's buddy-a      character called Three-Legged Muskrat-who insists on      filing his saw chains by hand. Parp concludes: "Muskrat is      a real old-fashioned expert who has worked with sharp steel      all his life. When he is finished sharpening a chain by      hand, it's almost as perfect as a chain that was machine      sharpened . . . ."    </p>    <p>      Now if you've ever tried to lay a file to a dull chain with      nothing more than your eyesight and fingertips to guide      you, you know that Muskrat must have been a near magician      with a file. And you're also well aware-if you've      ever tried hand-sharpening and failed-just how miserable      working with an improperly sharpened chain saw can be. Such      a device will move through a log slowly, may buck mightily,      and invariably makes a curved cut that jams the guide bar      in the middle of the timber you're trying to sever.    </p>    <p>      No doubt about it, there's no substitute for a chain that's      been honed to the correct angle and has had its cutters      properly profiled and trimmed to equal length.      Unfortunately, most amateur lumberjacks are at a loss to      determine how to get a correctly sharpened chain . . .      without making regular time-consuming visits (at $2.50 to      $4.00 apiece) to the local saw shop to have the job done.    </p>    <p>      We began looking for the answer to that question several      months ago, and gathered a representative selection of the      locally available do-it-yourself chain saw sharpeners.      Through the past summer and into the fall, we put the dozen      or so contraptions to work keeping the saws used at the      Eco-Village and by MOTHER's staff members in tiptop shape.      During that time we dulled a passel of chains (they were      subjected to about every job short of ditch digging or wire      cutting), and we've come to some definite conclusions about      what does, and doesn't, make an effective chain saw      sharpener.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RUB YOUR BELLY AND PAT YOUR FOREHEAD AT THE SAME      TIME</strong>    </p>        <p>      The complexity of the task that a chain sharpening device      must accomplish is formidable, and the job is made even      more difficult by the fact that the device has to be able      to perform many of the different functions at the same      time. First, and most obvious, the tool must precisely      establish the proper angle for the cutters in relation to      the direction of chain travel. Most saw chain (known as      chipper-type) is sharpened to a 35° angle, but some      chisel types are designed to use a 30° cut. However,      many experienced saw owners prefer to use a chain trimmed      to less than the recommended angle, in order to reduce the      strain on the operator during extended periods of sawing .      . . or to perform special tasks, such as ripping.    </p>    <p>      Whatever the means used to control the angle of the teeth,      a good chain sharpener also needs some mechanism to prevent      the file, stone, or bur from digging too deeply into the      cutter's gullet or (worse yet) into the tie strap. This      happens all too often to chains that are hand. sharpened by      amateurs. The telltale sign is teeth that are formed like      breaking waves at the beach. A chain that has been "hooked"      in this fashion not only is structurally weakened, but also      will dull quickly and pull and jerk when being used.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, there's another angle that must be taken into      account when sharpening a saw. Some types of chain have      their cutters ground at other than horizontal. For such      chains the filing device will typically be set to point      uphill at a 5 or 10° angle.    </p>    <p>      In addition, after months of evaluation, we're convinced      that an effective chain sharpener must include a provision      for controlling the amount by which the cutters are      shortened (unequal teeth are a major cause of curved      sawing) . . . a mechanism to grip the chain during      sharpening to prevent it from deflecting . . . and the      ability to deburr and smoothly finish the edge. And with      all that testing under our belts, we've come to prefer two      sharpeners to all the others evaluated, simply because they      both come closest to meeting the criteria listed above.      However, depending on the type(s) of saw(s) that you own,      one of them may to be the better choice for you    </p>    <p>      <strong>GAMN': $24.95</strong>    </p>        <p>      The Gamn' sharpener is a newcomer to the market, and works      quite differently from conventional file-type sharpeners.      It hones with a carbide bur that the operator turns with a      crank (instead of employing the reciprocating motion common      to file sharpeners) . . . consequently, the manner in which      the Gamn' removes metal from the chain is also different      from that of a file sharpener.    </p>    <p>      There are a couple of advantages to the Gamn' approach.      First, because the blades on the bur are moving parallel to      the direction of chain travel, any irregularities produced      in the tooth's steel surface (which might be caused by      chips of metal, for example) will be aligned with the      cutting action. Thus the gouges will be much less prone to      plugging with wood resins than would be the case with a      device that trims metal perpendicular to the direction of      chain travel. In addition, the clockwise rotation of the      car bide bit won't leave a raised burr on the finished edge      of the tooth.    </p>    <p>      Moreover, the Gamn' sharpener is solidly constructed (it's      made from aluminum), clamps rigidly to the saw's bar, is      equipped with a cinch nut to hold the chain while      sharpening, has an adjustable stop for setting the cutter      length, and holds its rotating bur accurately to 35°      (and horizontal). A newcomer to sharpening can get the hang      of using it quickly, and a practiced operator should be      able to sharpen a chain faster with the Gamn' than by any      other manual method.    </p>    <p>      We have only two minor reservations about this otherwise      excellent tool. For one thing, the device is quite      uncompromising . . . it sharpens to only one angle (which      means some saw owners won't be able to use it), and a      different bur is required to sharpen chains of differing      pitch. (This is also the case with file sharpeners, but the      Gamn' tool's carbide bits are somewhat more expensive than      files. However, the cost may be outweighed in the long run      by the greater life expectancy of the grinder's extremely      hard burs.) Second, the Gamn' does such a fine job of      removing metal tha t an inexperienced or indiscriminate      user could easily whittle away a great deal of tooth in      short order. Unless the sharpener is properly adjusted (to      remove the minimum material necessary), the result could be      an oversharpened chain with a significantly shortened life      span.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OREGON FILE GUIDE: $24.50</strong>    </p>        <p>      We tried out several different fileguide chain sharpeners,      but none could approach the Oregon in either quality or      performance. It's obvious that this manufacturer of saw      chain thoroughly understood the qualities needed in the      tool <em>before</em> developing the specifications for the      device that bears the company's name.    </p>    <p>      The Oregon File Guide is equipped with numerous adjustments      (enough to thoroughly intimidate a newcomer at first), and      can accurately produce any conceivably useful combination      of sharpening angles. The cutter angle, measured from the      direction of chain travel, can be set anywhere between 0      and 45°, and the upward tilt is adjustable between 0      and 20° .    </p>    <p>      This Cadillac of file guides also features a pair of      screw-in clamps (for proper centering) which hold the      chain securely against the side load imposed by the file.      The length of the cutters can also be set with an      adjustable rubbing block (which prevents the file from      moving beyond a fixed amount of travel), though this      mechanism isn't as solid as is that on the Gamn'. What's      more, the Oregon has one adjustment that wasn't included on      any of the other file guides: The stop for the cutter can      be moved, which allows the operator to position the file      directly over the gullet. Thus the file will travel more      nearly parallel to the bar as it swings through its arc.    </p>    <p>      We found the Oregon tool to be significantly easier to use      than were any of the other file guides tested. Its tracking      rod fits snugly in its bushings . . . so the shaft doesn't      bind when a stray metal chip gets in the area. (The other      units needed frequent lubrication to prevent such an      occurrence.) A chain can be sharpened fairly quickly with      the Oregon . . . once you learn the adjustments and      establish a rhythm. Still, the procedure was considerably      more timeconsuming with the Oregon than with the Gamn'.    </p>    <p>      Though the two sharpeners that we've described here are      very different in design, both are capable of doing an      excellent job. Still, it's a good idea to take your chain      to the pros about once in every five sharpenings. Their      very precise motorized equipment will quickly rectify any      errors you might have been making with your mechanical      device . . . and- while you're there-you can      have your depth gauges adjusted as well. Furthermore, on      about every <em>third</em> visit to the saw shop (or      approximately once in 15 sharpenings), request that the      proprietor inspect the drive links to insure that they're      still properly profiled to fit snugly around your saw's      primary sprocket.    </p>    <p>      If you follow a maintenance schedule similar to the one      we've described, you'll find that your saw, and all of its      various subsystems (such as the bar), will last for years .      . . and that your work will go as quickly and pleasantly as      possible. Just keep reminding yourself of the      <em>first</em> time that you made a cut with your still      brand-new saw. There's absolutely no reason why it      shouldn't perform that well year after year!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The Oregon Fit( Guide can be purchased      from any dealers who carry Oregon Products (they're      numerous).
