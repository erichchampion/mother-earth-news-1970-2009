                   <p>      <em>Just look at these scrumptious creations. Now can you      blame us for wanting to share...</em>    </p>         <p>      <strong>STAFF PHOTO</strong>    </p>    <p>      Recently, MOTHER's staff taste-tested several ginger      recipes for this issue's Herb Garden column. And after      sampling-or should we say devouring-the holiday      fixings, we couldn't resist offering instruction for some      additional spice-filled treats, along with the      honors-winning recipe given on page 101. So the top four      runners-up are presented here . . . as well as sourcebook      information and some notes based on our own cooking      experience.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHRISTMAS LOAF GINGERBREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      This recipe, like the Crown of Ginger-bread included in      MOTHER's Herb Garden, is adapted from Louis de Gouy's      <em>The Bread Tray</em> . . . available from Dover      Publications-Dept. TMEN, 180 Varick Street, New York,      New York 10014-for $4.00 (plus 75 cents shipping and      handling, or $1.25 if ordering two or more copies).    </p>    <p>      Start preparing the fruity-flavored delicacy by sifting      together 4 cups of bread flour, 2 teaspoons of baking soda,      1-1/2 teaspoons of ginger, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, 1-1/2      teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves, and 1/4      teaspoon of nutmeg. To this dry mixture add 1/4 cup each of      chopped nuts, seedless raisins, and mixed chopped candied      fruit (we also included 2 tablespoons of minced preserved      ginger).    </p>    <p>      In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup of melted butter or other      shortening (we used vegetable shortening), 1 cup of      buttermilk (our recommendation) or sour milk, 1 cup of      molasses, 1 cup of honey, and 4 whole eggs. Beat the liquid      ingredients until they're thoroughly blended, then add that      mixture to the dry combination and stir vigorously. Pour      your prepared batter into two generously greased bread pans      (MOTHER's chefs dusted the tins with ground ginger first)      and bake the loaves at 350째F for 50 to 55 minutes, or      until the centers are firm. Cool the holiday bread before      slicing, and serve the sections with whipped cream topping.      You can store leftover pieces-if there are any      -in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      <h3>GINGERBREAD PEOPLE</h3>    </p>    <p>      The Junior League of Shreveport, Louisiana included this      recipe in its book, Revel, which is available for $11.20      postpaid from Books Unlimited (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 4648,      Shreveport, Louisiana 71104). The transforming touch which      makes this soft cookie so delectable is provided by the      freshly grated orange peel.    </p>    <p>      Cream 2 sticks of butter or margarine with 1-1/2 cups of      sugar. Then add 1 egg and beat the batter until it's light      and fluffy. Now, mix in 4 teaspoons of grated fresh orange      peel and 2 tablespoons of dark corn syrup or molasses. In a      separate bowl, combine 3 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of      baking soda, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ginger,      1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of cloves ... and      add the ingredients to the creamed mixture before blending      everything well.    </p>    <p>      Chill your prepared dough thoroughly. Then, working with      small amounts at a time (leave the remainder in the      refrigerator until you're ready to use it), roll it out to      1/4" thickness on a lightly floured board or pastry cloth      (we found that the latter made it easier to lift the      cookies).    </p>    <p>      After you cut out your gingerbread figures, place the spicy      desserts an inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet and      bake them for 8 to 10 minutes at 375째F. Cool the snacks      for a minute before removing them from the pan. Now, you're      ready to decorate . . . and to share. <em>(EDlTOR'S      NOTE:</em> The article on page 136 will tell you how to      whip up a <em>batch of</em> free cutters to shape your      <em>gingerbread cookies!)</em>    </p>    <p>      <h3>GINGER BISCUITS</h3>    </p>    <p>      Our next recipe is adapted from Cooking With <em>Spices and      Herbs</em> edited by Judith Gaulke (Lane Publishing Co.,      Menlo Park, California). The collection is out of print a t      present, but you might find a copy at your bookstore or      public library.    </p>    <p>      Ginger biscuits proved to be a great favorite with MOM's      workers, even though we had to serve them cold. Hot,      slathered in butter, they're absolute mouthwatering! We all      agreed that cry tallized ginger is the "secret ingredient      that gives these biscuits their wonderful flavor and      texture.    </p>    <p>      To make the holiday treats yourself, together 2 cups of      flour, 4 teaspoons of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt,      and 1/4 cup of sugar (if honey is used as substitute, add      it to the <em>liquid ingredients).</em> Now, cut 6      tablespoons of solid shortening or butter into this mix      until resembles small peas in size, and stir 1/2 cup (about      3 ounces) of finely chopped crystallized ginger until the      sweet sels are evenly distributed. Next, beat 2 eggs      lightly in a measuring cup . . . then add enough milk to      make 1/2 cup of liquid Pour this into your flour mixture      and blend the combination with a fork.    </p>    <p>      At this point, you can shape the resulting dough into a      ball and knead it gently four or five times on a lightly      floured board. Then roll or pat it out to about 1/2"      thickness . . . cut the pastry with a biscuit cutter (or      the rim of a small drinking glass) ... and arrange the      disks, leaving about 1-1/2 inches between them, on a      greased baking sheet. The recipe will make approximately 15      large or 30 small biscuits    </p>    <p>      Brush the tops of the pastries lightly with melted butter      or cream, and bake the ginger rounds in a 425째F oven      for about 10 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Serve      them up hot!    </p>    <p>      <h3>JAMAICAN GINGERBREAD</h3>    </p>    <p>      This robust loaf is from <strong><em>The Garden Way Bread      Book</em></strong> by Ellen F. Johnson (available for $9.95      postpaid from Garden Way Publishing Co., Dept. TMEN, 1539      Ferry Road, Charlotte, Vermont 05445).    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 350째F. Sift together 3 cups of      flour, 2-1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of      baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of      allspice. In another-and larger-bowl beat 2      eggs until they're light in color and slightly thickened.      Add 1/2 cup of melted butter (or part butter and part light      oil which was our preference), 1/2 cup of un sulfured      molasses, and 1 cup of evaporated milk (or you can      use-as we did-a half-and-half blend of milk and      cream).    </p>    <p>      Beat the liquid ingredients again, then stir in 3      tablespoons of grated fresh ginger root (if that's      unavailable, 1 tablespoon of ground ginger will do), 1/2      cup of chopped crystallized ginger, and 1 cup of chopped      nuts. Now, fold in the flour mix ture-blending it in      with a spatula until it's just incorporatedand pour the      batter into a large, well-greased loaf pan. (Again, we      predusted our container with ground ginger.) Bake the bread      for 50 minutes n, until its top feels springy and a test      straw in the middle comes out clean.    </p>    <p>      Let your Jamaican treat rest in the pan about 10 minutes      before removing it to a rack. Finally, serve thin slices      topped with sweet butter, whipped cream, or whipped cream      cheese. Ah . . . delicious!    </p>
