                <p>      <strong>Meet a contemporary quiltmaker who uses a unique      paper-folding technique to achieve</strong> . . .    </p>            <p>      Over the past few years there has been a real rebirth of      interest in traditional North American crafts. Part of the      reason for this handiwork renaissance, perhaps, is that      people today yearn for the satisfaction that comes from      creating a lovely object with their own hands. In many      cases, too, a modern craftsperson will undertake a project      simply because he or she has been moved by the beauty of an      old piece of folk art, and-through a personal      interpretation of it-hopes to pay homage to its      heritage <em>and</em> to inspire other folks to continue      the evolution of the craft.    </p>    <p>      Of course, there are very few people who can approach this      ideal, whose work can successfully integrate the traditions      of the past with the influences of the present. MOTHER      recently was privileged to meet one such artisan, though .      .. Jinny Beyer: a well-known quilter, writer, and teacher      from Fairfax, Virginia. Jinny's creations deserve mention      not only for their obvious beauty, but also because her      quilts-while remaining faithful to the heritage of      quiltmaking-show what contemporary craftsfolk can      accomplish using modern-day fabric and an imaginative      approach.    </p>        <p>      Now most people have had the opportunity to examine-often      with some awe-age-faded patchwork quilts, and anyone who's      ever sewn has marveled at the skill and love that typically      went into such coverlets. Oddly enough, we appreciate this      form of American folk art today far more than did our      ancestors of the mid-1800's to early 1900's. During that      time people tended to regard quilting as a lowly occupation      ... a craft suitable for young girls beginning their sewing      careers or for older women whose failing eyesight would not      permit them to do finer "fancywork". Quiltmaking was also      looked down upon because it was considered a labor of      necessity" . . . and the term conjured up images of      utilitarian bedclothes pieced together by poor folk from      castoff scraps of cloth.    </p>    <p>      Ms. Beyer relates a story reported by one of her students,      who asked her grandmother about quiltmaking. The older      woman replied, "We did no quilting in this house . . . we      did no quilting."    </p>    <p>      "But Grandmother," Jinny's pupil persisted, "there must      have been some quilting done ... I've heard Aunt Sally talk      about it."    </p>        <p>      "No, no. we did no quilting," asserted the grandmother.    </p>    <p>      Later, long after the old woman had died, the family      cleaned out the attic. "They discovered trunks full of      beautiful quilts," Jinny said. "But my student's      grandmother hadn't wanted to admit that they'd      <em>needed</em> to make quilts in those days."    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, attitudes have changed, and quilting is now      receiving its due recognition. It's not unusual for groups      of 200 to 300 people to meet regularly to work on their      creations and attend lectures about the craft. And MOTHER      feels it'd be difficult to find an individual who could      better inspire anyone thinking about starting a first quilt      <em>(and bring</em> some new ideas to advanced      practitioners of the art) than Jinny Beyer. Therefore, we      asked her to tell us about her involvement with this      traditional American folk art.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TODAY'S ART</strong>    </p>        <p>      While no <em>one</em> element makes Jinny's creations      "different", several factors do distinguish her patchwork      from that of others. including her love of geometric      designs . . . the unique paper-folding method by which she      achieves the often complicated patterns for her blocks . .      . the manner in which she combines fabrics to achieve      visual effects that weren't present at all in any of the      original materials used and her frequent use of borders.    </p>    <p>      Many of the special features in Ms. Beyer's work can be      traced to the seven years she and her family spent in the      Orient, which not only influenced her early ideas about      design, but enabled her to develop her ways of using      patterns and fabrics in relative isolation (a situation      that will be familiar to many of MOTHER's homesteading      readers). She started her first quilt in the spring of      1972-while living in India-using scraps of      locally available cotton she'd bought to make patchwork      skirts for relatives.    </p>    <p>      "I didn't know anything about the `rules' of quiltmaking,"      she recalls, "because no one in my family was involved in      the craft. I was just doing what I liked and combining      fabrics in a way that appealed to me At that point, I was      still insecure enough about my creativity that I'm sure,      had I been in the States, I would have studied contemporary      quilts and made sure that my first one followed the      accepted guidelines."    </p>    <p>      However, upon Jinny's arrival home in 1973, her      self-confidence received a big boost . . . because her      family and friends raved over the Indian-cotton patchwork.      When the time came for her to find a frame and quilt the      top, she discovered a newly organized quilters' group and      immediately joined up.    </p>    <p>      As Jinny worked both with the group and on her own, she      became more proficient and eventually started      <em>teaching</em> beginning quilters' classes. During that      time, she also made the decision to continue exploring the      geometric patterns that she'd come to love, and resisted      suggestions that she venture into free-form patchwork. Ms.      Beyer discovered that the structure and framework of      geometrics-rather than limiting her creativityseemed      instead to spur her on to expand the boundaries imposed by      the fabrics.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PAPER-FOLDING</strong>    </p>        <p>      Traditional patchwork quilts are assembled by first piecing      a number of <em>blocks</em> and then stitching them      together . .. so the process of establishing the block's      pattern-and sizing the segments that compose      it-is very important. And, as many handyfolk know, it      can be pretty difficult to draft a geometric pattern . . .      particularly if you have, let's say, an original design      that's based on a 15" square and want to reproduce it upon      blocks that are only 11-5/8 " on aside.    </p>    <p>      When Jinny started her bicentennial quilt, which was to be      made up of historical motifs, she required 10" quilt      blocks. It didn't take her long to become frustrated with      hunching over graph paper and laboriously enlarging or      reducing the patterns she'd elected to use, so she was      quite excited when a friend showed her how a geo metric      quilt block could be divided into smaller squares .. . and      how those units could be broken down further into their      individual components. That revelation helped Jinny to      develop the paper-folding method that she now uses and      teaches.    </p>        <p>      Simply stated, Ms. Beyer's system begins with a true square      of the desired measurement (a drafting square-or a      compass and ruler-is used to insure that the corners      are right angles). Once the rightsized square has been      measured and cut out from thin but sturdy tracing paper,      the block is divided-with creases-into smaller      units corresponding to the individual segments of the      chosen design ... whatever size that original may be.      Through repeated horizontal, vertical, and diagonal folds.      one can arrive at the proper-sized components for a block      of the exact dimensions required ... without tedious      enlarging or reducing on graph paper.    </p>    <p>      The accompanying illustration shows how the "Flower Basket"      quilt pattern can be analyzed and adapted, using the      paperfolding technique. The pattern drafter has-as      shown by the illustrated grid-figured out the correct      components, and (as you can see) discovered that the      pattern is composed entirely of small squares and right      triangles. To arrive at the correct size for the individual      patchwork pieces, he or she creases the tracing paper block      into 16 small squares and bisects one of those squares      diagonally.    </p>    <p>      The quilter then cuts out one square and one triangle from      the tissue paper block ... transfers those two shapes to      cardboard (or sandpaper or clear acrylic) to make templates      ... figures out how many of each shape will be needed in      each fabric being used <em>. . . adds seam allowances      during the clothcutting process . . . and</em> stitches the      pieces together to complete one quilt block. (Obviously,      paper-folded patterns would also be useful in other      crafts involving geometrics . . . including woodworking,      needlepoint, mosaics, Jewelry, and weaving).    </p>    <p>      <strong>FINDING FABRICS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Jinny's knack of combining fabrics to the best      effect-balancing light and dark colors, playing large and      small prints against one another, and adding contrast      pieces that encourage the eye to rove over the entire      quilt-is the result of constant and careful      observation. For example, as MOM's photographer was      shifting powerful studio lights around and taking pictures      of the quilts, it was apparent that Jinny was mulling over      something not connected with the goings-on. Finally      she asked, "Would you mind if I checked some fabric under      your lights?"    </p>    <p>      The artist then brought out an elaborate, unfinished quilt      top and explained that she'd been thinking about replacing      its background material. Jinny spread out the patchwork      (which looked gorgeous just the way it was), arranged the      substitute pieces, studied the result from all angles under      the harsh glare, reached a conclusion (she did decide to      try a different fabric design), and folded up her work.    </p>    <p>      This anecdote illustrates a point that Ms. Beyer makes      repeatedly in her teaching and books: A quilter must      continually experiment with different textile designs to      come up with pleasing and harmonious combinations. She      recommends arranging the various pieces on cardboard and      studying the different effects possible in each block . . .      and later, after the squares have been composed, shifting      the blocks themselves around in order to find the      arrangement that brings the best balance.    </p>    <p>      Jinny's work also depends upon her "marriage" of stripes to      produce optical illusions, borders, and geometric shapes.      To obtain such effects, she uses "repeat stripes", as      fabric manufacturers refer to them, which are usually      symmetrical bands of varying width, printed across a bolt      of cloth. Such material is rather difficult to find (see      the picture on page 86 for examples) ... and textile      millswhose wares come out twice a year don't generally      include more than one or two suitable patterns in any one      season. Ms. Beyer, who's been collecting lengths of      attractive material ever since she started quilting,      suggests that beginning craftspersons buy a number of      "spare" yards of fabric whenever they see an interesting      design.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BORDER</strong>    </p>    <p>      The use of borders-often created from repeat stripe      material-is yet another characteristic of Jinny's      work. Such trimming may be no more than a single narrow      band snipped from material and used to frame a block . . .      or it could be a highly intricate pieced border that      becomes one of the main components of a quilt. Ms. Beyer      says that her love of "frames" resultedin part-from her      years of exposure to Oriental culture.    </p>    <p>      "There's so much more pattern to my life now," Ms. Beyer      said. "I think all of my traveling-seeing the      ornateness of things in the Orient-is reflected in my      work. I saw borders everywhere I went . . . an elegant      temple design with a frieze around the top, and the      beautifully decorated edges of women's saris. I began to      think of the border as a stopping place for the eye."    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUILTING TECHNIQUES</strong>    </p>    <p>      After we'd talked about the artistic elements in her work,      we asked Jinny to give the quilters among MOTHER's readers      some tips gleaned from her experience as a teacher. First,      Ms. Beyer prefers to handpiece her quilts. "I enjoy the      serenity of doing handwork. I can take time to make all the      tiny points match in the blocks, and I don't get the      hurried feeling that I do when working at the sewing      machine," she asserts.    </p>    <p>      When the top is finished to her satisfaction, she places      it-with its filling and lining-in a large      traditional wooden frame. "There aren't many things I'm      adamant about in quilting, but I do feel that some kind of      frame is essential," Jinny maintains. "When you're      quilting, you have to give the thread a bit of a tug with      each stitch ... and that tautness results in a small amount      of puckering that makes the quilting look really nice."      When not using a frame, quilters run the risk of getting      their stitches too loose or too tight, thus reducing the      overall effect of their work.    </p>    <p>      Ms. Beyer also uses all-cotton material to piece her      quilts because most commercial battings do contain some      synthetic fibers to prevent lumping after repeated washings      ... a problem that frequently occurred with the all-cotton      battings used by old-time quiltmakers. Cotton fabric      sunlike synthetic blends-don't encourage fiber      migration (or "bearding" as quilters call it), which      results in a white fuzz popping up over the quilt's      surface. Synthetic material in the top will act as a      magnet, drawing the polyester fibers of the filling to the      surface. There'll be some bearding in almost any quilt,      even when the top is all cotton, but the natural fabrics      suffer less from fiber migration than do the synthetics.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING STARTED</strong>    </p>    <p>      The best way to get started in quilting, Jinny says, is to      <em>begin a</em> quilt. "I've seen too many people get      bogged down with small, unsatisfying projects just because      they're <em>afraid to</em> start a large one. Quilting      isn't hard, though . . . it just requires a little time and      practice."    </p>    <p>      A beginner should set aside a year to work on his or her      first quilt . . . allowing perhaps six months to complete      the top, and the rest to get the knack of-quilting on      a frame. Ms. Beyer also firmly believes that a novice      should select a pattern that interests him or her, even      though it may appear imposingly difficult at the outset.      "By the time you've finished piecing two or three blocks,      you'll have mastered the design," she says. "You may have      to redo the first few clumsy attempts later on, but at      least you'll be involved with a design that excites you!"    </p>    <p>      While teaching, Jinny has noticed that most beginners      aren't as intimidated by the thought of piecing their      patchwork as they are afraid to begin <em>quilting the</em>      finished top. To counter this fear, she introduces her      students to quilting during their second lesson (the first      class is devoted to paperfolding patterns).    </p>    <p>      "When I started quilting my first top," she remembers, "my      back hurt, I was poking my fingers with the needle, I was      making large stitches, and I was going very slowly. I'd      really enjoyed the handwork of piecing the quilt, but found      that I wasn't enjoying quilting at all."    </p>    <p>      After three or four weeks, though, Jinny had solved her      problems: A lower chair eased her backache, she learned to      use a thimble, her stitches became more uniform, and her      speed increased. Novice quilters just need to hang in there      at first, she says, and keep in mind that their painstaking      quilting stitches are just as important to the finished      product as were the tiny seams that pieced together an      attractive top.    </p>    <p>      Classes and quilters' groups can be good places to get the      instruction <em>and</em> support that beginners so often      need. If there's a class taught in your area, sign up.      There are also a number of helpful manuals-including      Jinny's own books and newsletters on the subject, some of      which are listed at the end of this article.    </p>    <p>      And, to ease the minds of those of you who keep flipping      back to look at the photos and thinking (understandably!),      "I could never do that," here's a word of encouragement:      The magnificent "Ray of Light" medallion quilt (it's      hanging in the background in the shot of Jinny rocking) was      finished in 1978 ... less than six years after she started      her first quilt. Furthermore, the coverlet-which was      one of more than 10,000 entries-won the Great      American Quilt Contest, sponsored by the U.S. Historical      Society and <em>Good</em> House <em>keeping magazine</em> .    </p>    <p>      <strong>Can you think of a six-year apprentice</strong>      <strong>ship better spent?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Jinny's</em> first <em>book,</em>      Patchwork Patterns, <em>explains</em> her paper <em>folding      method and shows a</em> reader <em>how</em> to make      templates for any <em>number of</em> geometric <em>designs      . . . quilt</em> blocks based on squares <em>and      triangles,</em> eight-pointed stars, <em>hexagons, and even      curved pieces.</em> Her <em>second</em> volume, A Quilter's      Album of Blocks and Borders, catalogs more <em>than</em>      750 quilt patterns <em>which</em> can be created by means      of the <em>paper-folding technique; gives</em> <em>hundreds      of suggested border patterns, and contains a very thorough      explanation of the author's theories about combining      fabric.</em>    </p>    <p>      Patchwork Patterns, $15.95, <em>and A</em> Quilter's Album      of Blocks and Borders, $16.95 <em>(both books are published      by EPM Publications),</em> are available from <em>Mother's      Bookshelf, P</em> .O.
