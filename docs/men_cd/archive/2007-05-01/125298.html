        <p>Tired of opening your mailbox to piles of unwanted promotions?On average, each American receives<a href="http://www.41pounds.org/impact/" target="_blank">41 pounds</a> of junkmail per year, and more than<a href="http://www.41pounds.org/impact/" target="_blank">100 million trees</a> arelost annually to produce those advertisements and solicitations.While you likely receive mail from businesses or causes that youvalue, you probably get mail from many in which you have nointerest. As always, you can recycle your excess mail, andthankfully, easy options now exist to minimize or even completelystop unwanted mail.</p><br /><p>Web sites such as<a href="http://www.greendimes.com/" target="_blank">GreenDimes.com</a> and<a href="http://www.41pounds.org/" target="_blank">41pounds.org</a> can remove yourname from direct mail advertisers' lists for a fee ($36 for oneyear; $41 for five years, respectively). Less pricey alternativesand a few simple tips also can significantly reduce the amount ofjunk mail sent to your home.</p><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.directmail.com/" target="_blank">DirectMail.com</a>compiles a list of people who<a href="http://www.directmail.com/directory/mail%5Fpreference/" target="_blank">indicate</a>that they don't want to receive advertisements in the mail.Registration for the list is free, and the Web site then suppliesthe list to mass mailers, which can choose to check it with theirmailing lists and remove names that appear on both.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>For a $1 processing fee, the<a href="http://www.the-dma.org/" target="_blank">Direct Marketing Association</a>can <a href="http://www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailing" target="_blank">add yourname</a> to its 'do not mail' list. The DMA requires its more than3,600 member companies to match their marketing lists with the 'donot mail' list. You will see junk mail decrease about three monthsafter your name gets on the list, which is updated four times ayear.</p><br /><p>Both services assure that they do not pass along your name oraddress to any mailing lists. Both work only for home addresses,not business addresses. Neither can guarantee a complete stop tojunk mail, and be aware that registering for either list can alsoprevent you from receiving mail you might want, such as coupons,catalogues, and mail from nonprofit and charitableorganizations.</p><br /></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>To specifically stop credit card and insurance offers, call(888) 5-OPTOUT (888) 567-8688 or register at<a href="http://www.optoutprescreen.com/" target="_blank">optoutprescreen.com</a>,which removes your name from major credit agencies' marketing listsfor five years, or permanently if you complete a mail-in form.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Don't be afraid to sign up for things you want. If you'reconcerned that your name and address will be added to other mailinglists, write a variation of 'please do not sell or trade my name oraddress' next to your information when making a donation, placingan order, or filling out a form for a warranty, subscription oreven for a drawing. That way you'll get what you want, but nothingmore.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><ul type="disc"><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>When you receive an unwanted solicitation from a specificcompany, call its toll-free number to directly request removal fromits mailing list. Businesses should be accommodating becausesending mail only to interested customers saves them money. If youwant to minimize the amount of mail you receive from charities yousupport, ask them to only mail materials to you once a year orunder special circumstances. Then reward them by donating whenyou're ready.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p>For many industries, including the magazine industry, directmail is a means of reaching and maintaining customers.
