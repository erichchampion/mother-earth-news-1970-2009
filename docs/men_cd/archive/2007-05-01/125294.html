        <p>There are few things more relaxing than napping in a hammock. Hammocks are relatively easy to build with some basic materials, so you’ll be swinging yourself to sleep in no time.</p><p>Hammocks are compact, collapsible and you can put them inside or out - in any place where you can securely attach both ends to support your body weight. If you’re planning on camping this summer, take a hammock and sleep under the stars. They’re easy to pack and allow for a cooler slumber in warm climates because you won’t be cooped up in a tent.</p><p>You can also put a hammock inside as a napping spot, or even a bed, in most rooms. If clutter is a problem in your life, it can double as a storage rack and allow for more storage underneath. Hammocks can be made in various ways and don’t require a lot of knowledge or time to make. You can sew one from material left over from previous sewing projects, or even use an old blanket. If you’ve got some basic knowledge of knots, you can weave your own out of sturdy twine or rope. Using macramé, you can decorate your hammock by weaving different colors into the design.</p><p>To weave a hammock, you’ll need about two pounds of seine twine, anywhere from No. 40 to No. 46 thickness, two welded steel or brass rings 2 to 3 inches in diameter, two 1 1/2-by-1 1/2-by-33-inch hardwood bars, a smooth gauge stick that measures three-fourths to 1 1/2  inches by 12 inches and a netting shuttle. To make this hammock, from the one described in <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/DIY/1982-05-01/Heavenly-Hammock.aspx" target="_blank">A Heavenly Hammock</a>, you’ll need to know how to tie square, weaver’s, lark’s head, half hitch and plain overhand knots. For detailed instructions, check out the article.</p><p>A hammock is a great addition to your backyard, porch, or even your bedroom. There’s nothing like a nap in the sun, so get creative and see where you can put one.
