        RIGHT: We find, secured by another twist of wire, the pressure tank of methane which fuels the Bate Hillman. In this case, the tank is a recycled ""camping gas"" bottle of a type common in England. LEFT: The patented Bate Auto Gas Converter with all frills removed. This important piece of hardware and instructions for setting up your own methane plant is what you receive when you buy a converter from Bate. BELOW LEFT: There are days when being a world-famous chicken farmer-inventor is a royal drag.
