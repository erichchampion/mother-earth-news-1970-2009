                    <h5 id="byline">      by ROD CHADWICK    </h5>        <p>      A. The foothills of the Knockmealdown mountains, one of the      best inland spots in Ireland to seek inexpensive land and      established farms.<br />      B. Lough Erne, strewn with uninhabited islands.<br />      C. The Western Isles of Scotland, another happy hunting      ground for island buffs.<br />      D. East coast Scotland south of Aberdeen, a good source of      inexpensive mainland properties.<br />      E. A vast area of near-to-nil population.<br />      F. The twin towns of Lancaster and Morecambe. Lancaster is      on the road and rail routes to just about everywhere and is      particularly useful as a jumping-off point for the Lake      District. Inexpensive hotels and apartments are abundant in      Morecambe and Heysham, a few minutes south, is the ferry      departure point for Ireland.<br />      G. The northern and southern limits of "Mid Wales", an area      isolated from the resort development of the north and the      industrial development of the south.<br />      H. The region in which most of England's inexpensive hill      farms are located. It centers on an area not usually marked      on maps known as the Rossendale Valley.<br />      I. The beautiful Devon and Cornwall area, somewhat isolated      from the mainstreams of commercial farming.<br />      J. Weymouth, the departure port for Jersey and the other      'Channel Islands'.<br />      K. Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands and the      closest to France.    </p>    <p>      The distant and foreign acreages of Alaska and Canada have      received a lot of coverage in the American back-to-the-land      journals and even Australia and New Zealand are now being      mentioned. But the British Isles have so far been left out      of this English-language grouping . . . understandably but      mistakenly. For, while Britain has no "free" lands or      acreages open to homesteading, the United Kingdom does      offer opportunities for the purchase and rental of small      and inexpensive farms.    </p>    <p>      England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland are often represented      as terribly overcrowded countries where open stretches of      territory no longer remain. In fact, the British Isles have      many such uncluttered landscapes.    </p>    <p>      For example, 2,250,000 acres sown to wheat; 18,000,000      acres in arable production; 12,000,000 head of grazing      cattle . . . are figures for where? Canada? The U.S.? Not      at all. These are recent figures for England, Wales and      Scotland . . . the totals for Ireland not included. To      complete the "wide, open spaces" concept, we would have to      add in even larger national park and wilderness areas.    </p>    <p>      In short, Ireland, Scotland and Wales are densely populated      in only a very few of their thousands of square miles. Even      in England, there are major stretches of low-population      country to the southwest of Bristol and north of      Manchester.    </p>    <p>      Hill farms, mainly suited to beef and sheep, situated in      Wales and the north of England may presently be purchased      outright for between $100 and $150 U.S. per acre. (To make      it easy for most readers of this publication, all prices      are quoted here in U.S. dollars.)    </p>    <p>      Mind now, this $100 to $150 price per acre buys substantial      buildings and land that is already in production. Farm      valuations in these areas rarely take any account of the      farmhouse or livestock accomodations. Sales are on purely a      "per acre" basis with fixtures "thrown in". Wooden      buildings are uncommon and house, haybarn, cowshed, etc.      are usually walled with local stone and roofed with blue      slate. I'll wager that even "free" homestead land in Canada      and the U.S. cannot be cultivated and built on for less.    </p>    <p>      The typical hill farm-perhaps built in the 1700's and      certainly not much beyond 1800-might appear more      historic and beautiful than useful and pleasant to live in.      Several farms and country houses are, in fact, designated      "historic monuments" while being operated by quite ordinary      people in quite ordinary ways. The houses, however, have      modernized-but still cozy-interiors and the      outbuildings are updated and businesslike behind their      castle-like doors. There are few derelict farms in Britain.      Those for sale are either kept in use until sold or have      been only recently vacated.    </p>    <p>      Hill farm pastures-fenced by ancient, dry stone      walls--are sometimes quite steep but each property      usually has a few acres of good bottom land that is worked      as a hay meadow. In addition, many hill farms are situated      on the edge of vast, publicly-owned moorlands and are sold      with the rights to free range cattle or sheep on the moor.    </p>    <p>      Livestock markets, feed suppliers, country schools and      friendly shops and pubs are never too far down the road      from British farms. The country homes are castle-like in      more ways than one, however, and isolation is available in      any degree desired. You may pick your estate so that the      nearest town or village is completely out of sight . . . or      part of a panoramic, almost bird's eye view from the farm      house.    </p>    <p>      The relative unpopularity (and resulting low cost) of the      hill farm is based on: (a) the higher productivity of the      best land in the valleys and its ready adaptability to      modern, intensive farming methods, (b) the so-called      "shorter summer, longer winter" climate of the      winter-shadowed hill farm and (c) a general dislike of      living and working up and down a windy hillside. On the      other hand, of course, many people are able to see      advantages in the hill farm's characteristics.    </p>    <p>      By the way, misconceptions about British weather seem to be      as widespread as those concerning open space in the United      Kingdom and a word is in order:    </p>    <p>      Summers in the British Isles better those of western Canada      where so many back-to-the-land folk are flocking nowadays.      Winters better those of all the United States save southern      California, Florida and the lower third of Texas. The      British climate, in other words, lacks extremes and the      United Kingdom is almost ideal for year-round habitation.    </p>    <p>      Granted that timing a vacation (when you have only two      weeks to soak up a year's worth of sun) can be a gamble in      the British Isles. Still for comfortable living, working      <em>and</em> farming . . . the climate is second to none.      Remember that 2,250,000 acres of wheat ripen annually in      Britain and many more acres of hay are harvested. Both      crops are difficult or impossible to produce in much of      British Columbia and other areas being considered by      back-to-the-land people:    </p>    <p>      For that matter, you can pick and choose your climate to a      certain extent in the British Isles. Consider, for      instance, the Island of Jersey. Jersey is part of Britain      but closer to France than England. It's a remarkably      beautiful spot and the island's long sunny summer and early      spring makes Jersey the "California of England" . . . or,      as Jersey P.R. men say, "Britain's South Sea Isle".    </p>    <p>      On the British mainland, the very best summer and winter      weather is enjoyed southwest of Bristol in the Devon and      Cornwall district. The land is flat-ish and the area      somewhat isolated (a Birmingham farmer sits at the center      of a web of national highways but roads in Cornwall lead      only to Cornwall). Due to this relative isolation, land      prices in the region are low and $200 per acre will still      buy a farm complete with house and attractive stone      outbuildings.    </p>    <p>      The land bargains in Devon and Cornwall may soon be eaten      away by somewhat more inflated "country retreat" prices      since the area is one of outstanding beauty. As it is, a      property of under 50 acres is usually priced with more      emphasis placed on the house and buildings . . . but the      per-acre cost of a larger farm doesn't really seem to take      the structures into account at all. The larger the farm,      the better the buy, in other words.    </p>    <p>      This rule of economics does not seem to prevail in Scotland      and Ireland . . . probably because there are few large      farms in either country. Instead, both Scotland and Ireland      have a strong tradition of very small farms akin to the      U.S. concept of the homestead. In Scotland these small land      holdings are known as "crofts" and their inhabitants as      "crofters". Prices under $150 per acre are common in both      countries.    </p>    <p>      Scotland suffers a more extreme winter than does the rest      of the British Isles . . . without the advantage of a      sympathetically balanced summer climate. Ireland's emerald      greenery, meanwhile, owes as much to a high rainfall as it      does to fertile soil. Both countries, however, have charms,      lifestyles and-indeed-people which differ      greatly from those of England and Wales. These are      generally considered to be more than adequate compensation      for the less clement weather.    </p>    <p>      Island and total isolation buffs will find rich pickings in      both Scotland and Ireland. The coastline of Scotland is      fragmented in many stretches into chains of wild and      beautiful islands whose links with "civilization" are      tending to diminish, rather than increase. Try getting to      Eriskay or Mingulay in a hurry and you'll see what I mean.    </p>    <p>      There are seals, otters, red deer, golden eagles and rare      seabirds here. Time passes slowly. It was only yesterday      that the Norsemen left . . . only yesterday that Jacobite      Charlie was hunted from cave to cave. Gaelic is still      spoken, peat still burnt. Women weave tweed, shepherds walk      the hills and poachers still net the lauds' salmon.    </p>    <p>      To learn more about these islands or to rent a fisherman's      boat or farm cottage on one of the isles, write:    </p>    <p>      The Highlands & Islands Development Board<br />      Via The S.T.B. 2 Rutland Place<br />      Edinburgh, SCOTLAND    </p>    <p>      Over in the west of northern Ireland, there's a county      named Fermanagh . . . and in Fermanagh there aren't many      people, so they use up the land by planting forests.      There's also a 300-mile square lake in Fermanagh called      Lough Erne, on which you can sail for hours and hardly see      another boat. The waters are full of salmon and trout that      never know a hook from one year to the next and there are      about two hundred uninhabited islands in the Lough.      Nevertheless, the area is only two hours by road from      Belfast (where the ferry from Heysham makes a connection to      England). To ask about the Lough Erne Islands, write:    </p>    <p>      N.I.T.B. Royal Avenue,<br />      Belfast BTI IDQ<br />      Northern, IRELAND    </p>    <p>      Although the standard of living in the British Isles is      close to that enjoyed in the United States and Canada,      wages and prices are each about 50% less than those      operating in North America. This means that any U.S. and      Canadian dollars taken to Britain are at least      doubled-and often trebled-in spending power.    </p>    <p>      Outside London you'll find room and breakfast for $2.00      U.S. per day and $3.00 to $4.00 will buy you a room with      all meals . . . less by the week in both cases. Other      typical prices include: fish and chips sit-down dinner, 45       cents; movie theater, 40 to 60  cents; natural brew beer, 25       cents per Imperial pint (larger than a U.S. pint);      tomatoes, 10 to 15  cents a pound; sprouts, 9 to 12  cents a      pound; potatoes, 3 to 6  cents per pound; 25 to 50  cents a      pound for fresh caught fish; ground steak, 25 to 35  cents a      pound; 45 to 50  cents a pound for mushrooms; milk (fresh,      farm bottled and delivered), 12 to 15  cents per Imperial      quart. Mind now, these are <em>normal</em> prices. Every      nation has it's "bargain basement" if you stay long enough      to find it.    </p>    <p>      Certain items do cost more in the United Kingdom, due to an      especially high purchase tax. Liquor, cigarettes, vehicle      fuels and automobiles are among these exceptions but,      fortunately, farm fuels are untaxed and-therefore-very      inexpensive indeed. "Commercially applicable" vehicles such      as trucks, vans and pickups also escape purchase tax      which-in any case-is not applied to second-hand      vehicles of any description. For the record: cigarettes      start at around 40  cents a pack and go as high as 60  cents      for the longest and fattest. Whisky, gin and vodka sell at      $5.00 a bottle and around 30  cents a drink over the bar.    </p>    <p>      Still and al-even in town-two people can live      in the British Isles on $25 a week without being miserable      shut-ins. Many a working man with a large family manages      happily enough on only twice that amount. A farmer may      transcend all this, of course, and simply set his      production to the income he requires. Markets for produce      are close at hand, earnings spend more slowly and-as      elsewhere-a vegetable garden, dairy goats, hens,      rabbits and other produce can go a long way in making the      homesteader self sufficient and largely independent of the      need for a cash income.    </p>    <p>      For those who do want a moderate income from the land in      Britain, without getting into all-out farming, a simple      cattle rearing program based on grazing and winter hay      maintenance feeding might be the best bet.      Spring-purchased, 4-month-old dairy calves can be bought      for $60-$80 and are readily saleable for $120-$175 as      "bulling heifers" the following spring. A similar market      (at prices 10 to 20% higher) exists for beeftype bullocks      or steers. Such feeder operations require little more skill      than attention to summer fencing and winter stall cleaning      and bedding. All the hay-making machinery may be hired      (with operators) for a total final cost of 10  cents per      60-pound bale. Excess hay may be sold at 60  cents per      bale during an average summer and that price often doubles      towards the end of a long winter.    </p>    <p>      Using a stocking rate of one head of young stock per acre      for an average hill farm, it is possible to roughly      calculate the necessary investment you must make for a      particular future income. Using U.S. prices to cost other      needs will guarantee a wide-and advisablesafety margin.    </p>    <p>      For an idea of what Britain's press has to say about the      farming scene there, try:<br />    </p>    <p>      FARMER'S WEEKLY, Agricultural Press Ltd., 161 Fleet Street,      London EC4, England. This magazine is full of farms,      livestock and sundry equipment for sale. It also contains      features and news stories that describe one innovative      technique or another that an individual (or, perhaps,      eccentric) is using which otherwise might never be heard of      outside his' own area. The publication also runs a free      information service in its 100 MOTHER-size weekly pages.      The price in Britain is 24  cents anti a dollar should bring      a single copy airmail or several (6 to 8) by sea    </p>    <p>      FARMER'S GUARDIAN, 127 Fishergate, Preston, Lancashire,      England has a similar format but is a week ly tabloid      newspaper of 20-25 pages published in the north of England.      It's price is a fantastic bargain at only 9  cents a copy in      England. Again, one dollar should bring a sample or two by      air or at least a five week subscription by surface.    </p>    <p>      It's also possible to subscribe to, receive samples of or      get a description of all farming and gardening periodicals      published in England (or throughout the world, for that      matter) from:    </p>    <p>      Blackwell's<br />      Broad Street<br />      Oxford, ENGLAND<br />    </p>    <p>      Blackwell's will also supply their catalog (894) of British      farming books which are much less expensive direct than      from U.S. sources. <em>Organic Farming,</em> by H.      Coney-to cite one example-is listed at only      $2.16.    </p>    <p>      Going back to the land in Britain offers many fringe      benefits, some of which should be at least briefly      mentioned here. First and foremost, of course, is the      lifestyle . . , at once both more relaxed and civilized      than the degrading "rat race" now so prevalent in North      America.    </p>    <p>      The cities and towns of Britain were, for the most part.      established long before the age of urban sprawl and highway      strip building. As a result, the populations of cities      which take up whole counties in the United States are      snugly accomodated by much smaller areas in the United      Kingdom and, today, outward "development" of cities is      limited by strict land-use laws.    </p>            <p>      Both radio and television are much more pleasant to an      adult in Great Britain and tuning in is an alternative life      style by itself. I wish everyone who is even remotely      interested in Britain would read a copy of the BBC's weekly      guide, Radio Times. It's available by air for $1.00 from:    </p>    <p>      BBC Publications<br />      35 Marylebone High Street<br />      London, ENGLAND    </p>    <p>      BBC radio has four channels: (I) Pop and jazz; (2) Light      music, plays, magazines, live comedy, variety; (3) Up, up      and away highbrow; (4) News, documentaries, plays,      education courses, light to heavyweight music.    </p>    <p>      The standard of British television journalism ensures that      <em>Meet The Press</em> and the <em>Cronkite News</em>      would be booed off the air if shown across the water. In      fact, in 1969 two American-made "adult" drama series were      dropped by BBC TV after only a few showings due to the      volume of critical mail from 8 to 11-year-old children!      Most of the 75% of British TV fare which is not imported or      awful movies is simply of a quality which cannot      successfully be communicated to residents of the U.S.      Suffice it to say that British television-with two      commercial-free BBC channels and one commercial      channel-has embraced ALL the freedoms of the new      theater, underground film, the impish and ravaging debates      of Parliament and British journalism.    </p>    <p>      The British airwaves were made even more attractive just      before the last national elections when the Socialist Labor      Party inaugurated a "University of the Air", now broadcast      over both TV and radio. Anyone, including tourists and      visitors, can enroll and-apart from a two-week      "summing up" session at an actual university-whole      courses in a full range of subjects can be taken via a      radio and a television set. The program is not quite free      (although the lectures are, of course). There's a nominal      enrollment fee to cover correspondence course mailings and      a few books and "Open U" publications to buy . . . but you      certainly receive a great deal for that small investment.      For further details (enclose a dollar if you expect a      weighty reply), write:    </p>    <p>      National Extension College<br />      8 Shaftesbury Road<br />      Cambridge, ENGLAND    </p>    <p>      In the field of "ordinary" education and child care, the      British government provides pre-school schools for the      children of working mothers; milk, vitamins, juice, etc.      for preschool children; and free education all the way up.    </p>    <p>      A back- to-the-lander will enjoy still other "extras" of      the Good Life in Britain. Consider medical care: to an      Englishman, medical treatment of all kinds is a      constitutional right. The idea that it be withheld      from-or not sought by-those unable to afford it      seems criminally wrong. Throughout the British Isles, all      the following benefits and services are free of charge,      regardless of income (many are also available, as a      courtesy, to foreign visitors): treatment or visits from a      physician; prescribed medications; hospitalization with any      and all treat ment given; all aspects of maternity care,      including at-home and hospital births; prenatal and      antenatal clinics.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps I should stress that it is never compulsory (as      many Americans presume) for a citizen to accept whatever      the state provides in the British Isles. The alternative of      purchasing the service or substituting another on your own      is always there.    </p>    <p>      And still more possibilities for Good Living in the United      Kingdom: farm houses (redundant after farm amalgamations)      for rent at $11 per week; town houses WITHOUT land, selling      outright at $1500 (no "O's" left off there!);      live-in-and-help-crew motor yacht cruises on the Thames and      English Channel at $30 weekly and less, all inclusive.    </p>    <p>      There are many more such gains and very few regretable      losses to take into account. In short, I think a North      American looking for an easier pace and simpler living will      find Britain similar enough to "home" to minimize losses in      transit but different enough to overcompensate in gains. No      one-least of all the British-calls the United      Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland      perfect. But perhaps, like democracy, the U.K. is "the      least bad" of a kind.    </p>    <p>      Entry into Britain is granted on a temporary (tourist)      basis quite simply at the port of entry. Length of stay      stamped into your passport is based on: (a) your own      requirements and (b) the money you say you have available      to you while in the country. When funds are low and you      want to stay long, you should explain that (1) you will      have no hotel bills because you will be staying with      friends or relatives [ have an address handy] or (2) your      family will be sending you money on a regular basis.    </p>    <p>      Later applications to remain <em>and become employed</em>      are not so readily approved. A visitor may renew a      temporary visa almost indefinitely, however, and summer      employment in England is OK with the immigration officers.      And, of course, a self-supporting land-owner may change      from tourist renewal to permanent resident status with      relative ease.    </p>    <p>      Conditions on the Island of Jersey are even better. There,      employment in hotels and in agriculture may be obtained      without the documents and other red tape required in the      rest of the British Isles. In fact, there are no passport      formalities of any kind at the end of the $10 ferry ride      from Weymouth on the south coast of England.    </p>    <p>      Maybe Jersey-with its sunny clime, remarkable beauty.      great number of gentle cattle which bear its name and      all-around lack of formalities-is the best      introduction of all for any North American interested in      going back to the land in Britain. In my mind, however, the      whole U.K. offers almost ideal opportunities for "modern      homesteading". Come on over and see for yourself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TRANSPORTATION TO BRITAIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Getting to Great Britain is, not the expensive proposition      you may have thought. A round-trip air ticket to London can      be purchased for only $150 and internal travel is quite      reasonable, even without using the "runabout" bus and rail      tickets available to tourists at token fees. And, of      course, the faithful thumb remains a legal and successful      way of getting about in the U.K.    </p>    <p>      The following agencies sell charter flights ($150 roundtrip      from the eastern United States). Other agents may be found      in the advertising columns of the LONDON SUNDAY TIMES, sold      at least on one newstand in every major North American      city.    </p>    <p>      Pan Europa Tours *<br />      25 Bloomsbury Way<br />      LONDON W.C. 1    </p>    <p>      The Trans American Society<br />      36 Dumbarton Road<br />      London S.W. 2    </p>    <p>      Charter Flights Unlimited **<br />      1490 West Broadway<br />      Vancouver 9<br />      British Columbia    </p>    <p>      The single disadvantage of these "club flights" is the      necessity of having one's name listed for five or six      months before departure. Once your name is down, however,      it's possible to book a seat on a particular flight without      further wait.    </p>    <p>      The ships of the HEAD & LORD LINE, 26 Beaver St., New      York, New York, regularly sail for Ireland and Scotland      from the east coast of Canada and the United States. The      trip across takes nine days so the $150      fare-including as it does, better than a week of      first class British hotel service-is reasonable      indeed.    </p>    <p>      Sea travel has the additional advantage of allowing large      amounts of baggage at no charge. Head and Lord will even      ferry a car across the Atlantic for you and, since British      auto makers offer their products at very reduced prices to      foreign visitors, you can always bring a bargain automobile      back to these shores if you decide not to homestead in the      U.K. Get full details on car purchase from:    </p>    <p>      British Travel Association<br />      612 South Flower<br />      Los Angeles, California    </p>    <p>      If you fly into London (as many of today's tourists do),      you'll find fast, direct train service to: (a) Manchester,      which is 15 miles south of the best area for inexpensive      English hill farms. (b) Lancaster, which is 15 miles north      of the same area and only minutes from Heysham and its      daily $5.00 ferry to Ireland. Lancaster is also on the main      road and rail route to Scotland and is the departure point      for the nearby "lake district" and a massive farming region      south of Scotland's border. (c) Liverpool, about halfway      between the hill farms of both northern England and Wales.    </p>    <p>      And while we're on the subject of transportation: the most      beautiful vacation in the world would have to be roaming      free the country lanes of Ireland at the reins of a      horse-drawn Gypsy caravan (wagon). The van sleeps four and      the hire-which includes oats for the horse and a list      of farmers who provide overnight parking and      grazing-is only $50.
