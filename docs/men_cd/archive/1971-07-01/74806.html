                		<h3>      THE OWNER-BUILT HOME, VOLUME 1, CHAPTER 4       <br />SUMMER COOLING    </h3>    <div class="sidebar">     <h3>KEN KERN</h3>    <p>      Ken Kern, author of THE OWNER-BUILT HOME and THE      OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, is an amazing fellow and everyone      interested in decentralist, back-to-the-land, rational      living should know of his work. Back in 1948 he began      collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural      construction materials and techniques. He combed the world      for ideas, tried them and started writing about his      experiments.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's      articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN REVOLUTION.      K en has also issued a three year series of pieces (called      TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun pit design of his      has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.    </p>    <p>      This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from      OWNER-BUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT      HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters      of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my      presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I      apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available      right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,      California 93644 for $10.00.    </p>    <p>      -MOTHER<br />    </p>    </div>    <p>      Since 1952 refrigerant air-cooling has come into its own in      this country. This was the year that mass-produced home air      conditioning units suddenly appeared on the market. The 20      companies sold 250 million dollars worth of equipment and      were forced to turn down 100,000 customers. Now there are      over 70 companies producing air conditioning units, with an      increase in output of 500%. Loaning agency figures indicate      that 40% of new homes have included some form of central      air conditioner. We hear more and more about Heat Pumps,      Combination-unit Air Conditioners, Dehumidifiers,      Package-split-system Units, and Evaporative Coolers.    </p>    <p>      Costs run high for all this air-conditioned comfort. In a      survey conducted by the National Association of Home      Builders it was found that the cost of installing an      average-sized air-conditioner in an average-sized house      came to $1308. The operating expenses exceed $70 per summer      season. And the Heat Pump, avowed king of year-round      air-conditioners, costs from $2500 up to install.    </p>    <p>      In this chapter I have no intention of discussing the      possible advantages of one type of air-conditioner over      another. In my opinion, they are all too expensive and      inefficient; and totally unnecessary where even the most      elementary rules of good planning are respected. The design      of a residential <em>cooling</em> system should not have to      meet the same physiological requirements as the design of a      <em>heating</em> system. Whereas heating systems must      produce an indoor temperature of at least 70 degrees F.      (regardless of the outside temperature), the cooling system      need only supply a drop in temperature of 10 to 20 degrees      below that of the outside. Mechanical air-conditioners      produce greater cooling differentials and thus are a "real      injury to health," according to the American Public Health      Association: "Heavy sweating in a hot outside temperature      leaves moisture in the clothing which greatly increases the      possibility of chilling when the body is exposed to a lower      indoor temperature."    </p>    <p>      The mechanistic approach to heating and cooling      requirements is based on the assumption of a steady flow of      heat. Actually, however, heat flow varies with time of day      and of seasons, and is further influenced by      site-orientation, building-structure, planting-design, and      period of house occupancy. Heating and air conditioning      salesmen tend to oversimplify the thermal requirements for      homes, but never mention the fact that heating and cooling      needs are of a temporary and local nature. As with electric      fans and lights, the artificial heating-cooling aids that      we use should be "space" equipment-employed only when      and where needed. One of this country's foremost      climatologists, Dr. Paul Siple, summed it up succinctly      when he said in his Building Research Advisory Board      speech: "Although we have made constant improvements in      buildings and have many mechanical developments to our      credit, we must admit that some of these improvements, such      as air-conditioning, have really been developed in order to      rectify errors or inadequacies in basic design." At the      same conference the feeling was expressed that our present      technical attitude tends to produce buildings which are      always "fighting their environment" instead of working with      it. Buildings have become over-engineered. Technical      facilities are employed to counteract situations which      common-sense attention to site, orientation, sun-path,      wind-path, and even proper use of vegetation might well      prevent.    </p>    <p>      This specialized, over-mechanization of modern houses has      driven us into a vicious circle of equipment-acquisition      with no end in sight. For instance, about one-third of a      ton of refrigerant is wasted in counteracting the heat      generated by a TV set alone (3400 BTU an hour). This      amounts to about $200 in first costs of an air conditioner.      If one includes the heat generated by the refrigerator,      water-heater, and stove, the first costs come to over      $300-money wasted before the rest of the room      temperatures have been reduced by one-tenth of a degree!    </p>    <p>      There is only one alternative to this unending purchase of      artificial aids to keep the house interior cool; a clear      understanding of heat-flow principles, ventilation effects,      and cooling requirements. In some instances a form of      mechanical ventilation <em>may</em> be called for in a new      home; but for the most part <em>natural</em> air      conditioning can be relied on, including adequate and      well-placed insulation.    </p>    <p>      It is a known fact that it costs three to five times as      much to remove a BTU of heat from a house in summer time as      it does to add one in winter. This statement can be better      appreciated once it is realized that a black roof-top on a      clear summer day can be expected to reach 150 degrees F. in      any part of the United States. Roofs receive twice as much      heat from the sun as do walls. Unventilated attics have      been known to reach temperatures of 175 degrees F. Our      first and most obvious reaction to this state of affairs      can be summed up in one word: <em>Insulate.</em>      Insulation, yes, but which of the 150-odd brands of      residential insulation should be applied? Should rigid      insulating boards, flexible blanket or batt, loose fill or      reflective insulation be used? And summer insulation is      known to work in two different ways; it may keep much of      the heat from entering the house through the roof; but the      heat that does enter is trapped in the attic-there to      re-radiate onto sleeping occupants throughout the night.      From a summer-cooling point of view, bedroom insulation is      unnecessary, and in fact restrictive of optimum summer      comfort. A light frame construction which heats rapidly and      is hot during the day will also cool rapidly at night and      thereby provide better night-time conditions than heavily      insulated construction. In winter, the rapid response of      lightweight construction to heating operates favorably, and      during sunny days this type of construction is warmer than      insulated construction; but lightweight construction cannot      retain heat so well, and is colder than insulated      construction on winter mornings. For hot summer conditions,      daytimeliving areas (living room, dining room, kitchen)      should be of well insulated construction to retard the      rapid rise of temperatures indoors during the day. For      evening-living areas and bedrooms, uninsulated construction      would permit more rapid cooling at night.    </p>    <p>      In accounting for summer-day, summer-night, winter-day and      winter-night heating and cooling requirements,      compromise-situations are inevitable. Yet we can bring into      play many <em>natural</em> air conditioning factors such as      solar orientation, overhang, ventilation, window-type, and      shading devices. The National Association of Home Builders,      at their Air-Conditioned Village in Austin, Texas, showed      that a <em>shift</em> of a house by only seven degrees from      South to West practically nullified the benefit of a      36-inch overhang. In one case, the sun pouring through a      large unnecessarily exposed window boosted the heat load by      4,200 BTU an hour and increased air-conditioning operating      costs by about 15%.    </p>    <p>      Roof-pitch is another contributing factor which can greatly      influence the efficiency of insulation. Research experts      assure us that a perfectly flat roof permits up to 50% more      heat gain than a pitched roof on the same site. This is due      to failure to get a natural hot-air flow out of the eaves      of a flat roof. As much as I personally favor the      exposed-beam-and-plank, shed-type building, it must be      admitted that the gable attic has a better resistance to      heat than does the flat-roof design. The plank-and beam      roof is difficult to insulate; when rigid insulation is      applied directly under the roofing material, there is      always the danger that by thus restricting the passage of      heat through the roof, high temperatures will build up and      increase the flow of tar on built-up roofs. Ceiling      insulation is therefore preferable to roof insulation for      this reason. When it is realized that overhead insulation      may save up to 90% of heat loss, it becomes obvious that      for summer as well as winter day-time living, the top of      the living space is the main thing to insulate.    </p>    <p>      Before one can determine the proper amount and best type      insulation to install in his house, he must have some      notion as to the maximum winter-heating and summer-cooling      requirements of his particular region. If a house is to be      built in a region of high summer-heat gain, one set of      conditions must be satisfied in order to maintain optimum      comfort. In regions where extremes in heat and cold occur,      a third set of factors come into operation.    </p>           <p>      Of the three ways in which heat flows through building      materials-convection, conduction and      radiation-it is radiation which contributes most      significantly to summer heating. On page 3 of the Bureau of      Standards circular (listed in bibliography) the following      passage appears:    </p>    <p>      Although air is a very poor conductor of heat, the      insulating value of an ordinary air space is rather small,      on account of the large transfer of heat by convection and      radiation. Radiation is largely responsible for the      ineffectiveness of air space bounded by ordinary building      materials, such as are found in frame or other hollow      walls. The low insulating value is often erroneously      attributed to convection; but, as a matter of fact, from 50      to 80 per cent of the heat transfer across air spaces of      ordinary sizes takes place by radiation. If the air spaces      were bounded by bright metallic surfaces, the transfer of      heat by radiation would be greatly diminished, since clean      metallic surfaces, such as brick, stone, glass, wood,      paper, etc.    </p>    <p>      Reflective metal foil (copper, aluminum, or steel) costs      less than 3  cents a square foot and can be easily      installed. One should remember to keep the shiny side out      (or up) and leave a ventilated air space inside (or below),      and at least 3/4-inch between the foil and the surface it      faces. A more expensive but also more highly efficient      insulator-aluminum clad, accordion-type material      known as Infra Multiple Aluminum Insulation-is      manufactured by the <em>Infra Insulation Company,</em> 525      Broadway, N.Y.C. which will send free samples on request.    </p>    <p>      About 70% of the sun's heat rays can be reflected from the      house by installing a white or light-colored roof. A thin      layer of quartz gravel or marble chip, backed by aluminum      foil on a built-up tar-and-felt roof is by far the best      type of surface for regions suffering a high incidence of      summer heat. If a layer of porous, crushed-tile chat or      crushed coral is placed over the built-up roof, and      <em>kept wet</em> during the more extreme periods of summer      heat, the house interior will remain cooler for a longer      time than if crushed marble is used. When water is used,      the roof is cooled by evaporation as well as reflection.    </p>    <p>      Water-cooled roofs were first experimented with in the late      1930's. At that time the roofs were built perfectly flat      and flooded with about 4-inches of water. The system worked      amazingly well during the day, keeping out about 80% of the      sun's heat. But during the night the warm water radiated      heat down into the house. Mosquito-breeding was found to be      a further disadvantage of the flooded-roof system.      Moreover, the design had to include a roof-structure strong      enough to support the great weight of water.    </p>    <p>      More recent experiments with water-cooled roofs have      conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of water      sprays. Ordinary rotating lawn sprinklers are perfectly      satisfactory, when placed so as to give complete coverage      to the roof area. Another method is to use a perforated      pipe along the roof ridge from which the water trickles      down-cooling by evaporation as well as reflection.      Roof-spray tests were made not long ago at the Universities      of Florida and Texas. It was found that water spraying      keeps out almost 80% of the sun's heat; every pound of      water vaporized removes 1,060 BTU of heat from the roof.      The temperature of a roof in Texas was reduced 15 degrees      (from 132 to 117) after sprays. Although it was found that      the water consumption totaled 10-gallons a month for each      square foot of roof, this rate can be reduced by 50% if a      thermostat in the roof is set to cut in at 100-degrees F.    </p>    <p>      Systems of water-cooling go all the way back to 2500 B.C.,      when the Pharoahs of Egypt employed slaves to fan air over      large porous earthen jars filled with water. The water,      seeping through the walls of the jars, exposed a large      wetted surface which provided evaporative cooling. Early      American Indians of the Southwest had similar results when      they placed porous earthen jars filled with water in the      open doorway. The water which seeped through the jar was      quickly evaporated by the dry air, thus cooling both the      air blowing into the house and the water in the jar. In      Mexico the same system is- used today, using porous earthen      jars called "olla."    </p>    <p>      Pools and fountains can also cool effectively when used      <em>indoors.</em> In Iran, for instance, it is common to      find pools of running water inside a house which is built      semi-underground to escape the solar heat. Ventilating      towers are provided overhead, which catch wind from above      the earth and divert it across the water pool and into the      underground room. It must have been in Iran that architect      Frank Lloyd Wright got his brilliant idea for cooling a      house he designed in Mexico; during the summer months the      sunken fireplace hearth was filled with water; the      down-draft air movement from the chimney circulates over      this "pool" and cools the living room. This unusual      fireplace has a summer-cooling as well as a winter-heating      function.    </p>    <p>      There is a German patent out for storing cool air in      cellars. The cooling capacity of the cellar is increased by      filling it with crates of crushed rock, which possesses an      enormous capacity for absorbing heat. A powerful fan feeds      the cool air upstairs during the day, and brings      <em>in</em> the cool night-air after sunset.    </p>    <p>      There are important practical principles that can be      learned from those indigenous and oftentimes primitive      cultures. For instance, we find that the Arab's tent has      slowly evolved throughout the centuries. As a functional      shelter-form it reflects and deflects the hottest sun on      earth. The Arab tent actually consists of two separate      tents. The upper one is white and acts as a reflective      layer; the lower one, inside it, is additionally protected      by the blanket of moving air in between. As the most basic      of all shelter forms, this tent-system also illustrates the      two most basic principles of summer cooling; reflective      insulation and ventilation. Without ventilation the effect      of insulation can be completely nullified and proven      inoperative. Insulation and ventilation systems must be      designed with each of their respective cooling effects in      mind; one system must supplement and reinforce the other. A      complete discussion of ventilation-design appears in the      following chapter.    </p>    <p>      This method of night-air-cooling is especially practical in      temperate and hot-dry climates, where night-time air      temperatures are significantly lower. The temperature of      the entire building structure and contents call be lowered      to approximately that of the basic night coolness. Then      during the day this stored-up cold provides a form of      radiant cooling from walls, ceiling, floor and contents.    </p>        <p>      The attic ventilating fan, or exhaust fan, is the least      expensive artificial cooling aid to install and operate.      And yet, a properly designed night-air cooling or daytime      exhaust system (in combination, of course, with a correctly      insulated and ventilated house-shell) can replace in summer      comfort the most expensive mechanical air conditioning. In      order to maintain fan-cooling competitive in results to      air-refrigeration, the fan must be correctly positioned in      respect to inlet and outlet openings. In an experiment      conducted by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a 16-inch      portable fan was used at a window to suck air <em>into</em>      a room. In an adjoining room an identical fan was used to      blow air <em>out</em> . Air temperature in the former case      was reduced only 8 degrees, whereas in the room where the      fan ejected hot air, the temperature fell 14 degrees. To      explain. When the fan exhausts air toward the outlet window      it picks up additional air from the room. This means that a      larger amount of cool air will enter the room from the      inlet window. It is also the reason why the fan should be      placed a distance of twice the width of the window-opening      away from the window. The width of a window or opening      should be twice the diameter of the fan blades. (A fan will      eject from 50% to 100% more air than it would if placed      inside the window frame itself.) In regions where the      relative humidity is high, and where there is little      difference between day and night temperatures (where night      temperatures remain above 750 F.), fans will prove less      efficient.    </p>        <p>      The difficult problem of providing a high U-value (or      fast-cooling) wall structure for summer, and a low U-value      (or slow-cooling) wall structure for winter, can be solved      by the use of fans. Cool night air can be circulated      between the studding; walls are insulated with reflective      insulation of little mass; air inlets are arranged so that      they can be closed in winter if desired, making a dead-air      space of fairly high insulation value.    </p>    <p>      During the day all ceiling registers are closed and air      inlet vents open. Fan draws air from one side of the attic      and forces it out at the opposite side. When outside air      temperature drops below inside temperature, the air inlet      vents are closed and ceiling vents opened. Fan draws air      from outside room windows, through ceiling registers to      attic, and forced out. The night air quickly cools air in      the rooms and, during the course of the night, continued      operation cools furnishings and interior. The next day, as      soon as the attic air temperature exceeds the outside air      temperature, ceiling registers are closed, air inlet vents      opened, and the cycle repeated.    </p>		<p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of    importance)</p>    <p>      <em>How to Keep Cool:</em> Arthur Carson; Harian      Publications, Greenlawn, N.Y. <em><br />      Design of Insulated Buildings for Various Climates:</em> T.

Actually, the earth block      construction I wish to discuss is as modern as the formica      sink top.    </p>    <p>      One of the really primitive methods of earth-wall      construction is "wattle-and-daub," in which mud plaster is      applied to both sides of a framework of woven reeds or      brush supported by posts or poles. Shrinkage cracks in this      thin wall are common, requiring almost constant      maintenance.    </p>    <p>      In the "cob" method, a wall of mud and straw rises without      any forms or molds. A "paring iron" is then used to trim      the wall true and straight.    </p>    <p>      In California the building codes, which apparently were      devised to protect the industry rather than comfort the      home owner or advance architecture, disapprove of all plain      earth-wall construction. The "earth-nogging" method,      accordingly, uses monolithic filler or earth blocks between      wood, concrete, or steel framing methods. A large      percentage of new earth-wall construction in California is      of this compromise type.    </p>    <p>      Apart from restrictive building codes, however, years of      trial and error in earth constructions have culminated in      newer systems of machine-compacted blocks and stabilized      soil-cement.    </p>    <p>      Generally speaking there are two classes of earth-wall      construction-puddled and tamped. In the former a molecular      aggregation of earth particles is achieved with a liquid      medium-a puddling process. In the second the earth      particles are compacted by the use of compression-a      tamping process. Adobe blocks are puddled (wet); rammed      earth is tamped (dry).    </p>    <p>      Whether puddled or tamped, the earth may be stabilized or      unstabilized. The common stabilizer used in the puddling      process is bitumen (mineral pitch or asphalt, or some of      the semi-solid tars), while that employed in tamping is      usually ordinary cement.    </p>    <p>      Finally, earth may be precast into blocks or cast into form      <em>in situ</em> . Walls of the owner-built home can,      therefore, be puddled or tamped, stabilized or      unstabilized, precast or made <em>in situ</em> .    </p>    <p>      One's choice of system depends upon a host of factors, such      as design, building code, type of soil, facilities,      equipment, and workers available.    </p>    <p>      It has been found that practically any soil can be somehow      used in earthwall construction. A soil which proves      unsuitable for building by one method may be entirely      satisfactory for another. For instance, a soil used in a      poured adobe wall may shrink and crack, but the same soil      may prove satisfactory for adobe blocks, since the blocks      are "pre-shrunk" before being placed in the wall. Also in      tamped earth methods, consolidation of earth particles      reduces shrinkage.    </p>    <p>      The sandy-clay adobe soil (with at least 30% sand and not      less than 50% clay and silt) of the arid Southwest is      usually considered ideal for puddled earthwall      construction. It is the clay that provides compression      strength and the sand that reduces shrinkage and cracking,      by lowering the moisture absorption. Adobe blocks are      molded from clay in a "plastic" state, often with a      moisture content as high as 30% (15%-18% moisture content      is considered optimum). Straw binder is sometimes used to      reduce cracking in unstabilized blocks, the straw being cut      into lengths of from 4 to 8 inches and evenly distributed      throughout the mass. About 150 lbs. of straw should be used      to make 1000 blocks (4 X 12 X 18 inches). Very little fiber      decomposition occurs in the adobe block; blocks in the      Southwest over 100 years old have been found to contain      dried grasses in such perfect condition that the species      could be identified.    </p>    <p>      In this country the usual practice is to stabilize, or      "water-proof," adobe blocks with an asphalt emulsion.      "Bitumul" is the commercial product for this purpose. It is      produced by a Standard Oil Co. subsidiary and retails for      about 25  cents a gallon. It would be less expensive to make      an unstabilized block and water-proof it on the outside.      According to tests conducted by the U. S. Bureau of      Standards, stabilizing blocks does not appreciably increase      their strength and the insulation value is reduced, since      the density of the block is increased by the stabilizing      process.    </p>    <p>      The Australian Commonwealth Experimental Building Station      devised a set of wooden adobe block forms that are as good      as can be found anywhere. As soon as the adobe mud is      hand-molded into the form, the form is picked up and placed      alongside for the next forming. Blocks should be kept in      their original position for at least 2-3 days to harden      sufficiently for handling. They should then be stacked on      edge, with air spaces between, in a sheltered curing area      for about three weeks before using. Blocks with a high clay      content should be cured more slowly.    </p>    <p>      Adobe mixing by hand is slow and tedious. Some type of      mechanical mixer can certainly be used to advantage. The      best type is the pug, dough, or plaster mixer. Concrete      mixers are generally not considered satisfactory unless      modified with blades or baffles to break up the material as      the drum revolves.    </p>    <p>      Adobe block production can be substantially speeded by      using a large rectangular wooden frame one brick deep. The      dimensions of its sides are in multiples of the breadth and      length of the block. It is filled with packed adobe earth      and leveled off. Then the block sizes are cut into the mass      of earth with a knife drawn along a straight edge.    </p>    <p>      Bitumen stabilization is commonly used nowadays to make the      earth blocks resistant to water penetration. This type of      asphalt emulsion mixes freely with soil of moderate to high      clay content, as well as with water. During the mixing      process the water carries the bitumen into close contact      with the clay particles, and as the water subsequently      evaporates it is replaced by the bitumen. Soils with a high      sand content (over 50% sand) should receive from 4 to 6%      emulsion by weight, whereas fine clay soils (less than 50%      sand) require from 13 to 20% emulsion. Also, the sandy soil      will require only 10% liquid to bring the material to a      workable state of plasticity whereas the fine clay soil      requires up to 20%.    </p>        <p>      Mortar consisting of the same mix of stabilized earth as      that used for making the blocks is recommended for the      joints in block construction, so that both will have the      same coefficient of expansion: A small amount of cement can      be added to the mud mortar, however, to make it set faster      and add strength.    </p>    <p>      At the Research Laboratory, Kansas State College, thorough      tests were made on hand-tamped soil-cement blocks. A block      structurally far superior to Bureau of Standards testing      specimens was made, using a minimum of 7.5% cement to a      sandy loam (10% clay) soil. This mix, slightly moistened,      was tamped into a form and placed in a moist room for a      twoweek curing period.    </p>    <p>      Several years ago, a Johannesburg, South Africa, block      maker invented an unusual machine for molding soil-cement      blocks. This ingenious "Landcrete Machine" is hand      operated, and a 60-pound pressure on a lever produces 1500      pounds against the block. Two men operating the machine can      produce enough blocks in two days to build an average-sized      Asian home, that is, nearly 1000 blocks per day. Each block      is about five times the size of a red brick and twice as      hard to crush. Landcrete blocks have the added feature of      being made to interlock so that there is no need for mortar      in laying them in the wall.    </p>        <p>      Structural tests were recently made on      identically-proportioned hand and machine compacted      soil-cement blocks at Asawasi, Kumasi (Gold Coast). Piers      six feet high and 18 inches square were constructed and      loaded to failure. It was found that hand-made blocks      crushed at 43 lbs. per square inch while machine-made      blocks crushed at 121 lbs. per square inch.    </p>    <p>      Machine-compacted blocks have been found to be structurally      far superior to sun-dried blocks as well as hand-compacted      soil-cement varieties. So much so, in fact, that it is      possible to reduce the outside bearing wall thickness to 6      inches instead of the usual 12 inches. In Colombia, 6-inch      earth blocks were used to construct buildings two stories      in height. No more than 5% of cement needs to be added to a      machine-compacted block.    </p>    <p>      The soil-cement block machine in use in Colombia (South      America) was invented in 1957 at the Inter-American Housing      and Planning Center, Bogota. Paul Ramirez, a Chilean      engineer and inventor of the Cinva Ram, worked for several      years developing a device which would, in his own words ".      . . give families of small means a manual tool that will      help them build the walls and floors of their houses." The      specifications for this tool were difficult to meet. It had      to be low-cost so as to be available to house-needy "rural      workers, farmers, and other people of small means." It had      to be simple to operate and maintain, light and portable.      One of the stipulations mentioned in an earlier program was      to the effect that the machine should be transportable by      burro and repairable in any backwoods blacksmith shop!    </p>    <p>      The Cinva Ram is a portable, hand-operated press for making      block and floor tile, and is available for purchase in      North America from the IBEC Housing Corporation, 30      Rockefeller Plaza, New York 10, N.Y. It consists of a metal      mold in which damp, stabilized earth is compressed by a      piston moved by a hand-operated lever mechanism. As a      result of the ingenious lever system, a 70-pound manual      pressure produces a compression force of 40,000 lbs., a      ratio 20 times better than that of the Landcrete Machine.      The blocks are then extruded by a reverse action of the      lever and removed to damp-cure for one week. They should be      air-cured an additional week before being laid.    </p>    <p>      When soil-cement mixtures are made, it is of special      importance to determine exact sand-clay proportions. One      simple test is to first fill a one quart mason jar      one-quarter full of the soil sample (the earth should first      be screened through a No. 4 sieve-six squares per      inch). The jar is then filled with water and a spoonful of      common table salt added to speed up the settling of the      clay. The jar should then be agitated thoroughly and      allowed to settle for one hour. The sand and clay will      settle in successive layers, the bottom layer being sand      and the top layer clay. Measure the height of the sand and      divide it by that of the total of soil settled in the      bottom of the jar. This will give the percentage of sand.    </p>        <p>      Damage usually occurs through dampness at and just above      the ground level of an earth wall. This is particularly so      in countries where it may freeze in the winter. Earth-wall      protection must be provided either through stabilization,      applied protective wall covering or design of the structure      itself, i.e., by means of damp-proofing courses in the      walls, resistive foundations, overhangs, verandas, etc.    </p>    <p>      Wherever possible I would recommend a building design and      wall system which does not require applied coverings of a      protective nature. Even the best covering is subject to      occasional repair and constant maintenance. Also, great      care must be observed in applying a protective covering,      lest it fail to bond to the wall or in use disintegrate      with continued freezing and weathering.    </p>    <p>      The most common mistake in applying protective finishes to      earth walls is made when the finish is applied before the      wall has completely "dried out." The presence of moisture      in the wall, and through the finish, will soften the wall      at the point of bondage and failure is certain to take      place. Some sort of mechanical bond, such as wire mesh, is      always recommended. Magdiel places single strand wires      across each layer of wall section as it is being built.      Then when the wall is completed, he attaches chicken wire      to both sides of the wall, secured by the tie wires      previously set. The wall is then plastered inside and      stuccoed outside.    </p>    <p>      For the sake of economy it would be good to dispense with      the wire mesh if possible. For a long time I wondered how      it was that Africans achieved such excellent results      without wire mesh, whereas in this country all sorts of      mechanical precautions must be observed to insure a good      bond. The answer is that in Africa the proportion of cement      to sand is in the nature of 1:12, plus a 5 to 10% admixture      to the plaster, whereas we are accustomed to using a 1:3      proportion and about 10 lbs. of hydrated lime to each bag      of cement. Apparently the coating of a strong material      (cement and lime) over a weaker material (earth) is      basically in error. Differences in expansion and      contraction are apt to cause cracking, breaking of the      bond, and ultimate failure. The 4,000 rammed earth homes      built in India (mentioned in the previous chapter) were all      successfully protected with a weak stucco composed of a      1:15 cement-sand mixture applied over a cement wash of 1:3      cement-water undercoating bond.    </p>    <p>      Possibly the most ancient of all wall finishes is Dagga-Mud      plaster. A good quality of Dagga plaster will contain      enough fine sand to let the plaster dry without checking.      The 3 parts of sand and 1 of clay should be screened      through an ordinary fly screen. Sometimes lime (1-8%),      cement (10%), or even asphalt emulsion (1 gal. to 100 lbs.      of dry soil) is added to the Dagga. The wall is first      dampened; then a primer coat of plaster is applied. It must      be kept damp during the early curing period. Two thin coats      are usually applied.    </p>    <p>      In Southern Rhodesia rammed earth walls are often sprayed      with a bitumastic emulsion and, when tacky, are "harled"      with clean sharp sand and thrown against the wall. A cement      wash is then applied. It has been found that a coat of      asphalt-base aluminum paint will bond very well to      asphalt-stabilized earth walls. Aluminum flakes in the      paint lie flat and overlap, thus preventing      leaching-through of the asphalt in the wall. A finish of      oil paint can then be applied.    </p>    <p>      Linseed oil is a very successful and widely used protective      covering for earth walls. Two or three brush coats should      be applied, followed by one or two coats of household      paint, if desired, for interior finish. "Dusting" of      interior walls can be eliminated by first applying a      home-made waterproof glue. This transpiration application      is made of 6 parts cottage cheese and 1 part quicklime,      with sufficient water to make it flow smoothly. The use of      cottage cheese for glue sizing may sound a bit odd, but it      must be remembered that most of the original research on      rammed earth finishes (especially by the University of      South Dakota) had in mind inexpensive construction for      farmers. This research group even developed a buttermilk      paint; 4-1/2 lbs. of white cement to 1 gallon of      buttermilk. Two coats should be applied over a glue-sizing      primer coat.    </p>    <p>      And experimenters at the University of Colorado had the      grain farmer in mind when they developed a flour and water      covering; 30 lbs. of flour and 50 gallons of water are      cooked to a creamy consistency and then added to a mixture      of the same soil that is used in the walls. Then more water      is added to thin it down.    </p>    <p>      Professor Kirkham's bulletin describes the type of "brush      stucco" he developed for both inside and outside treatment      of his $887.80 house. His two-coat stucco is very cheap,      does not crack, and is absolutely waterproof. It should be      applied with a stiff brush.    </p>    <p>      Place a cake of laundry soap (stearic acid soap) in a three      gallon bucket and fill the bucket with cool water. Then      take the cake of soap in your hands and rub the soap (as      you would to wash your hands) until the water becomes quite      soapy. This soapy water is used instead of plain water in      mixing the stucco. Next, place four pint cupfuls of      portland cement (4 lbs.) into another three gallon bucket      and to this add four pint cupfuls of fine sand. Then, using      a small wooden paddle, stir until the cement and sand are      well mixed. Then add the soap water and keep stirring until      the mixture becomes a stiff paste which is applied directly      to the wall .    </p>    <p>      . . . After the paste has been on the wall for 24 hours the      surface is painted (washed) with a copper sulphate solution      which is obtained by adding a quarter of a pound of copper      sulphate crystals to three gallons of water.    </p>		<p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance)    </p>    <p>      <em>How to Build Your Own Home of Earth:</em> Kirkham,      Oklahoma A & M, Stillwater, Okla., Nov., 1946<br />      <em>Building Materials and Structures Report:</em> B.
