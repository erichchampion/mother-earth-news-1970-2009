        	    		<h5 id="byline">      by BETTY BRINHART    </h5>		<p>      When my parents migrated from the Ukrain region in Russia      to the rich farm lands of Illinois during the late 1800's,      they were already experienced organic mulchers...not from      choice, but from extreme necessity.    </p>    <p>      Although the prevailing winds of the Ukrain could usually      be depended upon to provide sufficient rainfall during the      growing season, there were years when those winds      completely failed the farmers and gardeners. The dry,      scorching summers that followed could be just as cruel and      devastating to plant life as the Sahara and crop failures      and famine caused untold suffering among the inhabitants      during the year that followed.    </p>    <p>      Although these simple Russians put their entire trust in      God and Nature, they gradually realized that that was not      enough to insure them a decent harvest every year ...and      they set about devising some means of minimizing the      destructive force of the droughts.    </p>    <p>      One spring, someone tried using dried meadow hay as a mulch      to conserve soil moisture during the summer months. The      idea worked ...and spread like wildfire. Soon everyone was      cutting the lush, green grass in the meadows and along      streams, drying it in the sun and storing it in neat stacks      beside the family garden or orchard for use when needed.    </p>    <p>      When the vegetables were tall enough garden plots were      heavily mulched with a 12-inch layer of the dried hay and      more grass was thickly spread around fruit trees, berry      plants and flowers. Soon, garden mulching had become a way      of life, and - when one of the most severe droughts of all      hit the Ukrain several years later - the mulched gardens      came through with very little loss of production. Thus, my      ancestors warded off a potentially-serious famine.    </p>    <p>      Having learned the hard way that good gardening and summer      mulching go hand in hand, my mother gardened the same way      in Illinois. Here, however, she ran into criticism from      German-born neighbors who believed in 'clean' gardening.      They didn't want any 'trash' (as they called my mother's      mulch) in the aisles to spoil the beauty of their straight,      well-cultivated vegetable rows.    </p>    <p>      Although the neighbors laughed at my mother's 'sloppy'      gardening, she said nothing...but neither did she change      her methods. Then, as sometimes happens in Illinois, a      prolonged drought hit and not one drop of rain fell for      <em>two full months!</em>    </p>    <p>      The German gardens withered and died but my mother's, which      was heavily mulched with old hay, went on growing as usual      and that fall she could often be seen strolling down the      lane to one neighbor's house or another with a basket of      carrots, potatoes, squash or apples. The neighbors,      grateful for the fresh produce, apologized for laughing at      Mother's gardening ideas and began asking questions about      them. Before long, with my mother's help, almost the entire      neighborhood turned into one gigantic organic garden!    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY A GARDEN MULCH IS NECESSARY</strong>    </p>    <p>      A mulch is a layer of organic matter of variable thickness,      used as a soil cover to control weeds, preserve soil      moisture and improve the fertility and structure of the      soil itself. If you're energetic enough to keep a natural      mulch on your garden throughout the year, you will be doing      just as Nature has done since the beginning of time.    </p>    <p>      Try as you may, you will not find naked soil in the      wilderness. If it isn't covered with a lush carpet of      ferns, wild flowers and vines, such soil is hidden beneath      a thick blanket of dried leaves and decaying wood and      beneath the cover is a layer of organic matter in all      stages of decay. This is Nature's way of building rich top      soil.    </p>    <p>      You can create such rich dirt in your own garden (without      spending a cent) from unwanted plant materials and aged      manures. Heavy applications of compost (made from shredded      garden trash, leaves, man ure or green lawn clippings) and      manures of all kinds for three years will give you almost      one inch of rich new topsoil. It takes Nature 100 years to      do the same.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MULCHES GOOD AND BAD</strong>    </p>        <p>      Although plastic mulches are highly advertised, we won't      use them in our garden. In the first place they cost money      and, second, they do not improve the fertility, or      condition, of the soil in any way. Among the natural      mulches that we do use are shredded corn stalks, pine      needles, peat moss, spoiled hay straw, salt hay, green      grass clippings, shredded newspapers and young weeds that      have not yet gone to seed.    </p>    <p>      Although mulches may be purchased, I advise you to look      around before spending your hard-earned cash on the      store-bought variety. Most natural mulching materials can      be obtained free of charge from parks and streetcleaners      and grass clippings are always available from homeowners      only too happy to be rid of them. Units mowing along      highways will allow you to rake hay from the embankments,      and the telephone and power company men who prune tree      branches will usually give you all the shredded wood you      want.    </p>    <p>      Check your local lumber yards for wood chips and sawdust.      In the spring, farmers will sometimes let you have leftover      hay or straw just for cleaning out their lofts or barn      lots. (Look for unwanted cow manure here also.) Often you      can find a nearby unused lot or field from which the owner      will let you cut all the tall grass you need. And don't      forget to check factories in your neighborhood. Many throw      away plant and animal products that serve nicely as garden      mulches. If you gather more than you can use immediately      shred the excess with a shredder or rotary mower and make      compost. You can't buy a better garden fertilizer for all      the money in the world.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ADVANTAGES OF MULCHING</strong>    </p>        <p>      All types of gardening benefit directly or indirectly from      mulching and through practice you'll learn what type of      mulch and what thickness is best for every plant. Keep in      mind, however, that acid-loving plants, such as      Rhododendrons and all evergreens, prefer an acid mulch like      peat moss or pine needles while non-acid-loving plants,      such as most fruits and vegetables, prefer dried hay, grass      clippings and other non-acid mulches.    </p>    <p>      There are many advantages to using mulch in your summer      garden. For instance:    </p>    <p>      1. All natural mulches conserve soil moisture. With a      constant supply of moisture about their roots plants grow      steadily. This produces more robust growth, bumper crops of      tastier fruits and vegetables and bigger flowers. A mulch      can also save valuable plants during heavy droughts when      there is no water available for irrigation.    </p>    <p>      2. In dry, arid regions a mulch will prevent rain and wind      erosion. And when rains do fall in such an area the water      is quickly absorbed by the porous earth beneath a mulch. As      an added bonus, this rain carries free nitrogen which it      absorbed while passing through the atmosphere and the free      nitrogen becomes immediately available to plants as food.    </p>    <p>      3. A good mulch controls all annual and perennial weeds.      Should a weed appear it can easily be pulled by hand from      the soft earth below.    </p>    <p>      4. All soils, no matter how fertile, can stand a little      improving. Organic mulches quickly decay, merge with the      topsoil and enrich it with plant nutrients. As soil      particles absorb the decayed organic matter, they become      more crumbly in texture. This creates air spaces through      which oxygen can reach the roots and improves water      penetration. The aeration and penetration of water      stimulates root growth and biological activity in the soil      and the result's greater soil fertility.    </p>    <p>      5. A thick mulch is also an excellent controller of soil      temperature. Soil bacteria, which are constantly busy      releasing plant nutrients. from mulch and applied      fertilizers, work best in a soil temperature of 70 to 85      degrees F. When temperatures drop below or rise above this      mark, bacterial action slows down or stops completely. A      good mulch will maintain the right working temperatures for      soil bacteria throughout summer regardless of outside      conditions which, again, means your soil will steadily      increase in fertility.    </p>    <p>      6. When well-aged manures, tobacco stalks, soy bean hay or      grass clippings from well-fed lawns are used as mulch, very      little or no fertilizer is needed throughout the gardening      season. As these different organic products decay, they      slowly release all the nutrients a plant needs for good      growth without burning its delicate feeder roots.    </p>    <p>      7. Mulches do wonders in protecting the shallow roots of      such plants as blueberries, Azaleas and Rhododendrons.      Without a mulch, these plants must be cultivated. Deep      cultivation, however is detrimental to their health since      even the slightest scraping of the surface to control weeds      will sever a multitude of valuable feeder roots.    </p>        <p>      8. A 6-inch mulch of ground corn cobs, wood chips or      sawdust placed in the garden aisles, or paths, will enable      you to walk in your garden immediately after a heavy rain      without compacting the moist soil or getting your shoes      muddy.    </p>    <p>      Mulch placed under individual squash, melons or pumpkin      plants eliminates fruit rot due to direct contact with      cool, moist soil and soil insects. It will also prevent the      fruit from getting splattered with mud every time it rains.    </p>    <p>      9. A natural mulch is invaluable in areas that suffer from      great fluctuations in winter temperature. Properly applied      after the ground freezes hard in late fall, a mulch will      prevent the alternate thawing and freezing of the soil that      can completely destroy root systems of even the strongest      perennials.    </p>    <p>      Mulches will also prevent deep freezing around less hardy      plants and will help to keep the soil from freezing in bulb      beds where late plantings must be made in early winter. In      such cases, mulch is removed to allow the bulbs to be      planted, then it's replaced after the area freezes hard.    </p>    <p>      <strong>REMEMBER THESE FACTS WHEN</strong> <strong>MULCHING      WITH NATURAL MATERIALS</strong>    </p>    <p>      A. Mice will often nest under a mulch beneath low-hanging      branches. If left undisturbed they will eventually feed on      bark during the winter, and cause serious damage to your      trees. Either place traps beneath any mulch in the orchard      or keep the mulch at least 12 inches away from the trunk of      each tree.<br />    </p>    <p>      B. Dry mulches can be a fire hazard in dry weather. Be      careful about lighted matches and discarded cigarette butts      if you smoke while working in the garden.<br />    </p>    <p>      C. Natural mulches, such as sawdust, green grass clippings      and fresh hay, cause a nitrogen deficiency in the soil for      a short period after application. During this time, plant      growth suffers. Although the condition is never very      serious, it can be prevented entirely by scattering a      natural fertilizer high in nitrogen (animal manure,      bloodmeal, bone meal, tankage or sewer sludge) over the      surface before putting down the mulch.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER USES FOR NATURAL MULCH</strong>    </p>        <p>      By practicing these additional uses of mulch in your garden      you can add to your gardening enjoyment and success.    </p>    <p>      I. Apply a thin, finely-chopped mulch over a seeded row      (such as carrots) so that weeds will not choke out the      young seedlings before they get started. Remove as soon as      green shows beneath the mulch.    </p>    <p>      II. Allow a mulch to remain on light, sandy soil all year      and plant under it. But the mulch must be removed in early      spring from heavy soil so that such earth may dry off      quickly for early planting.    </p>    <p>      III. Do not mulch transplants, such as tomatoes or peppers,      until they are well started.    </p>    <p>      IV. Never mulch tall annuals as it causes them to set      shallow root systems which are inadequate for plant support      during heavy rains or strong winds.    </p>    <p>      V. Heavily mulch all plants that prefer cool soil      temperatures throughout summer, but mulch only the aisles      of those that like warmth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUMMARY</strong>    </p>		<p>      There is no easier nor cheaper way to improve your soil's      texture and fertility than by using natural mulches in your      vegetable and flower garden. Using a mulch is like having      someone do your gardening for you free of charge. There's      no water to haul, no weeds to pull and no fertilizer to      spread. And, should you want to take an extended summer      vacation, you need not worry about coming back to a garden      choked with weeds. When you mulch, your harvests will be      far greater and your fruits and vegetables will have a      better flavor and higher nutritional value.    </p>    <p>      So do yourself a favor this and every summer by letting      natural mulches do your gardening for you.    </p>

Use the chips like any other mulch, especially on garden paths and in heavily traveled areas. Best of all, like many mulches, wood chips are free for the hauling in most regions.
