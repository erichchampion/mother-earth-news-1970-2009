    <p>
            				<p>      A couple of weeks ago I got a letter from a reader of my      column, <em>ECOMMANDO TACTICS,</em> which appears in the      L.A. FREE PRESS. The reader-George      Tucker-wrote, in part, thus:<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      During the past eight months I have quite frequently ridden      my motorcycle on the Pomona Freeway from L.A. to Pomona and      back. Very early it struck me that I lost power at the      intersection with the 605 Freeway, so much so that I      usually pulled over to the right hand lane, minimized wind      resistance and hoped for the best. During most of this time      I knew the engine wasn't working properly but I thought      that it had just reached a point of warming up at that      place, thereby causing some reaction . . . and that perhaps      I was hitting a headwind coming from Pomona.    </p>    <p>      Then I removed the instruction manual from its position      blocking the air intake and made a few more trips. Now the      machine functions beautifully on both sides of the      intersection but still loses most of its power at the same      place.    </p>    <p>      I couldn't understand it at all until last weekend.      Then-in the midst of reading the Nader Task Force      report, <em>Vanishing Air</em> -I made a trip to      Pomona after running a few errands in L.A. and definitely      getting the cycle well worked into the groove and running      smoothly.    </p>    <p>      Coming back, I took the San Bernardino Freeway, which is      more crowded and more polluted than the Pomona and the      machine developed even less power! When traffic got      particularly heavy I actually had to gear down!    </p>    <p>      Right! Who says machines are dumb? They have more sense      than humans when it comes to pollutin'; when things get too      bad they just stop running! No wonder new cars need more      horsepower than old ones: they have to compete harder for      oxygen, just like you and me.    </p>    <p>      I suggest that all your readers take notice of these      effects next time they travel the freeways; it's easier      than looking at a piece of lung tissue.    </p>    <p>      By the way, can you recommend a good gas mask?    </p>    <p>      Well, the more I thought about George's letter, the less      ridiculous it sounded. But my inate scepticism wouldn't let      me take it at face value. Accordingly, I booted and      helmeted, fired up the trusty Honda and tooled on down to      Pomona. I made runs on that freeway: one during the evening      rush and another about eleven-thirty at night.<br />    </p>    <p>      And damned if George isn't right. I DID lose power during      the heavy-pollution times. And the loss was greater in      high-concentration areas (overpasses, stall points, feeder      sections, etc.) than in low.    </p>    <p>      I came home and thought about it. Could other factors be      involved? Was air pollution itself actually responsible for      my power loss? What were the possibilities of the loss      being caused by the bike itself, or by some unnoticed      physical factor . . . a very slight uphill grade, for      example, too small to notice by eye yet with an      accumulative inertia sufficient to slow my motorcycle's      engine?    </p>    <p>      Pondering all this, I soon realized that my mind was in      deeper than my training could back up. So I picked up the      phone and hollered for help.    </p>    <p>      Help came in the form of a couple of friends who are      measure-and-analysis freaks from the University of      California at Irvine. They wired me and the bike with      various nefarious devices and we made for the concrete      cowpaths once more. Then, looking vaguely martian, trailing      sundry wires and connections and followed by a pickup full      of recording equipment I took off down the road.    </p>    <p>      Surprise! No significant power loss due to air pollution!      Then we tried it again on Monday. In the traffic.    </p>    <p>      <em>Engine performance down TWENTY-ONE PERCENT</em>      <em>Carburetor efficiency down almost forty percent.      Estimated engine-life loss: twenty percent over a one-year      period.</em>    </p>    <p>      Well, it's bad enough to think that my loyal two-wheeler is      going to die before I can afford to convert it to steam.      It's even worse to think of the increased pollution it      emits due to bum carburetion. But it is infinitely worse      yet to realize that I can replace the bike, BUT NOT MY      LUNGS!    </p>    <p>      Like other forms of lung pollution, smog is tolerated      because we all think that we'll get out of the city before      it gets us . . . or that the government or Ralph Nader will      clean things up in time. But it ain't so. Every breath you      take in this atmosphere shortens your life by a couple of      breaths.    </p>    <p>      It's like that great American institution, the time      payment; you feel as though you're getting away with      something because the bill doesn't come due till later, and      it comes in small, painless bites . . . but in the end you      find that you've paid for your fun twice over.    </p>    <p>      And Brothers and Sisters, the bill ALWAYS comes. There's no      way to dodge it. The collection agency here is that dude      with the scythe, and he never misses. NEVER. In the case of      lung pollution, time is the coin, and time is the price.      You pay for ruined lungs in life itself.    </p>    <p>      Now, what are we going to do about it?    </p>
