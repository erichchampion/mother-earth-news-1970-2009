                    <h5 id="byline">      by SHIRLEY EWEN    </h5>        <p>      The earthworm-once regarded as a mere creepy-crawler found      on the road after a nice soft rain-has risen in status.      This underground creature now often dwells in bins,      barrels, washtubs and other containers. There, it gives      many people a new lease on life by putting bread on their      tables and clothes on their backs ... or even by supporting      them entirely.    </p>    <p>      One such person is Doris Hubbell, owner of the Charmer Worm      Farm in Sacramento, California. As Doris puts it: "I never      thought the earthworm would be just about my best friend,      but it is. When my husband had to retire from the      construction business because of a bad asthmatic condition      we were faced with areal problem: What kind of work could      he do that would fully support us and yet not be too hard?      Then, since there are at least 90 million fishermen in the      United States-including us-we decided that      raising earthworms to sell for bait might be just what the      doctor ordered."    </p>    <p>      The Hubbells started their new "farm" with four 4' X 7'      bins of red hybrid earthworms. Today Doris (Mr. Hubbell was      killed in an auto accident two years ago, and until      recently-when Doris decided to go into partnership      with Art Muzzin of Sacramento-she operated the      business alone) keeps <em>800</em> bins, and her customers      come from near and far to buy her "livestock" and the      fertilizer it produces. The Charmer Farm also ships its      worms and their castings all over the United States and      Canada.    </p>        <h3>      MEET THE EARTHWORM    </h3>    <p>      The red hybrid earthworm which saved the day for the      Hubbells should not be confused with the everyday      angleworm. The hybrid is a real moneymaker ... a superior      type developed for commercial purposes.    </p>    <p>      Today's red earthworms are larger than their ancestors: The      normal length of a well-fed, full-grown specimen is      3-3-1/2 inches, and some are even bigger. The      creature is very adaptable to widely varying climates and      conditions and will not become restless and crawl away if      it's provided with adequate food and moisture.    </p>    <p>      Like the ordinary angleworm, the hybrid is bisexual ...      each and every red wiggler has both male and female      reproductive organs. It can-upon mating with another      of its species-produce an egg capsule every seven to      ten days. The capsules, in turn, each incubate in two or      three weeks and release from two to twenty young. During      the following 60-90 days, the newly hatched worms      themselves mature to breeding age.    </p>    <p>      This prolific wiggler sells far better to anglers than any      other worm because it is tough and lively, stays on the      hook and-with its bright red color-excites fish      into biting faster. Gardeners are also anxious to buy the      hybrid worms because-just like the common varieties      from which they were developed-they've proven their      worth in the vegetable patch.    </p>    <p>      Earthworms are now recognized as highly effective natural      agents for soil improvement and are especially helpful in      loosening and aerating the ground. The little creatures      initially perforate the top layers of earth and then      gradually penetrate into the subsoil, where their burrows      open passages for plant root growth.    </p>    <p>      The worms also eat soil and organic debris and the      resulting droppings or "castings" are a valuable fertilizer      in finely granulated form.    </p>    <p>      H.A. Lunt and H.G.M. Jacobson of the Connecticut      Agricultural Experiment Station have made very thorough      chemical analyses of earthworm castings and uneaten soil      collected from the top six inches of a field. They report      that the casts contained about five times as much nitrate,      seven times as much available phosphorus, three times as      much exchangeable magnesium, eleven times as much potash      and one and a half times as much lime (calcium) as the      plain dirt. The increases came from the organic material      consumed and digested by the worms.    </p>    <p>      Earthworm castings are, in short, one of the finest organic      fertilizers available. They can be purchased from some      nurseries and at almost any worm farm ... and if you're      going into the business of raising red hybrids yourself,      you may want to take advantage of this profitable sideline.    </p>    <h3>      BUYING STOCK    </h3>    <p>      Earthworms are sold throughout the year (although spring      and summer are the busiest seasons) and the initial      investment in breeding stock for a wiggler ranch varies      with the individual "farmer" and the kind of project he      plans. "Pit-run" red hybrids, for example, are of various      sizes (whatever the spading fork turns up) and can be      bought for as little as $2.75 per thousand. Then again, a      bin of the worms may sell for up to a flat $150 ...      depending on the size of the box and the average maturity      of its contents.    </p>    <p>      Doris Hubbell feels that the raising of earthworms for      profit is fairly easy work that doesn't require much      initial investment. You don't, for instance, need a fancy      or costly container in which to keep your stock. Barrels      cut in half, wood pits built around trees or anything else      you can dream up will be suitable. Even a simple washtub      will accommodate as many as 3,000 worms before the      population has to be divided. Climate-and how deeply      you want to get into worm raising-will guide you in      your choice of a "stable" for your "livestock".    </p>    <p>      Doris and Art keep their wigglers in 4' X 7' wooden frames      which have no bottoms or tops and stand about 2-1/2 feet      above ground ... a type of construction that works well in      the mild Sacramento climate. Cement bins or cinder-block      structures two blocks high are also suitable for warm      regions. In a cold area it's best to build such containers      three blocks high-with two units below ground      level-for better protection from chilly weather.    </p>    <p>      It's even possible to run a small worm-raising operation      right inside a basement or other heated room. A wooden box      3 feet long, 2-1/2 feet wide and 1-1/2 feet high is      recommended if you intend to keep your stock indoors.      Important: Seal the seams of the container to prevent the      creatures from escaping. You should also fit the top of the      box with a frame covered with hardware cloth (you can make      the setup very convenient by hinging the lid to the bin and      adding a small screen-door hook as a fastener).    </p>    <p>      Another point: Several small drainage holes should be      drilled in the bottom of each bin (the worms do have to be      watered regularly, you know) and covered with fine-mesh      copper screen tacked to the wood. If the boxes are kept in      a place where they can't drain freely, small tin cans can      be set under the holes to catch the excess drippings.    </p>    <p>      A basement farm of this type can produce as many as half a      million bait or breeder-or an even greater number of      pit-run-worms per year. In fact, one retired Vermont      school teacher nets a profit of $1,200 annually by raising      earthworms in her cellar. Even mobile home owners      can-and do-go into this business ... stacking      the bins is the answer to their space problem.    </p>    <h3>      FEEDING    </h3>    <p>      No fancy food is required to keep earthworms happy. They'll      flourish on all kinds of waste organic material: animal      manure, dead plants or a million and one other things lying      around free for the taking.    </p>    <p>      Although many worm growers favor a bedding mixture of equal      parts peat moss, soil and rotted manure or compost, Doris      and Art have successfully raised big fat wigglers on steer      droppings alone. Occasionally they add calf meal to this      substance (many breeders use ground cornmeal, poultry mash,      soybean meal or similar products). Such feed may be very      thinly sprinkled on top of the bedding or buried in      trenches through the middle or around the sides of a pit,      but should never be mixed <em>into</em> the bedding where      it might heat and kill the worms.    </p>    <p>      The small grower will find that a box of earthworms makes a      good garbage disposal unit. Any kitchen refuse-or grass      clippings and dried leaves-can be used to feed the      creatures, and they'll thrive on it. Unlike the ground feed      mentioned above, such garbage may be mixed in with the      bedding material to eliminate odors.    </p>    <h3>      HARVESTING    </h3>        <p>      The harvesting of worms-the first step in getting      them ready for sale-can be done in various ways (on      large farms the operation is often done on a moving belt      with assembly-line efficiency).    </p>    <p>      During the summer Doris and Art hire a number of helpers,      some of whom work at benches or tables of convenient height      for sitting or standing. These particular workers bring the      worm-filled compost from the pit to the sorting area in      flat shallow trays. Other employees, however, harvest the      stock while kneeling directly over the pits. One female      worker can pick well over 20,000 wigglers per day from a      heavily populated bed.    </p>    <p>      There's no need to think on such a grand scale for a      backyard operation, however. Harvesting at such a location      usually requires only two people: one to scoop the worms      out of the bins, the other to fill and cover the cups. Most      breeders count their earthworms individually or in lots of      five or ten when preparing the wigglers for the containers      in which they are to be sold.    </p>    <p>      Various types of packaging are used for shipping worms ...      there are even specially designed cartons, attractively      printed and fitted with perforated covers to admit air.      "Breather" type paper bags-light, efficient and quite      inexpensive-are also very popular. Doris and Art pack      their hybrids in slightly moistened peat moss placed in      both cartons and bags. For further protection, the small      containers are then put in either corrugated boxes or      lightweight wooden containers for long distance shipping by      parcel post (uninsured).    </p>    <p>      The price for which worms can be sold fluctuates throughout      the country. In one area twelve 50-worm cups may wholesale      at $3.00 - $4.50, while at the lake fishermen may pay      50 cents-75 cents per container. The success and      earnings of your business will vary with locality, season      and demand ... plus your original investment and the effort      you put into the project.    </p>    <h3>      WHERE AND HOW TO MARKET WORMS    </h3>    <p>      If you intend your worm farm mainly as a service for      fishermen, tell all your sportsman friends-and the      neighborhood kids!-about the project. You can also      advertise in the newspapers and in hunting and fishing      magazines and put up a brightly colored sign to attract      attention.    </p>    <p>      Nor should you overlook the possibility of distributing      your worms through dealers, tackle shops, filling stations,      nurseries, boat docks ... and nowadays, believe it or not,      even through vending machines. And don't forget your other      potential customers: laboratories, aquariums, game breeders      and, of course, gardeners.    </p>    <h3>      A NEARLY IDEAL BUSINESS    </h3>    <p>      As you can see, earthworms are useful, profitable and not      too demanding of one's time. Since red wigglers don't bark,      bite, scratch, smell, chirp or need to be watered twice a      day and bedded down at night, they are indeed the nearly      perfect commercial livestock to keep in your backyard. You      can pack up your fishing gear, go away for a weekend and      the lively worms will be there-breeding, producing      egg capsules, hatching their young and growing big and      fat-when you return.    </p>    <p>      As Doris Hubbell says, "This business is here to stay ...      and it's a good way to earn your living."    </p>		<hr />		<hr />    <p>      <em><strong>Some advice for Me gardener who wants to      improve his soil.</strong></em>			</p>      <p>        <strong>Check to see if there are earthworms present. If        not, have your soil analyzed-most nurseries will do        this for nothing-and correct any major problems.        Then introduce worms to the vegetable patch.</strong>      </p>      <p>        <strong>Earthworms bought to improve a garden or compost        pile should be purchased in the fall. At that season many        of the wigglers are young and-with the advent of        wet, cool weather-will become extremely active and        feed on the organic debris in and on top of the ground.        This high level of activity continues through autumn and        the two seasons that follow. By late spring most of the        worms should be mature and-with the coming of        summer-will become less and less lively and exert a        smaller effect on the soil. If you can keep your earth        moist and cool, however, your helpers will remain quite        vigorous.</strong>      </p>		<p>      <em><strong>THE SHIELDS EARTHWORM LIBRARY</strong></em>		</p>	      <p>        <em><strong>The late Earl B. Shields, for many years a        keen promoter of the worm farm as a home business, also        became a major supplier of "how-to" literature on raising        wigglers for profit.
