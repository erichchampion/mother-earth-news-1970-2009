                    <p>      <strong>Excerpts from</strong> <em>PRACTICAL ANIMAL      HUSBANDRY</em> <strong>by Jack Widmer are reprinted by      permission of Charles Scribner's Sons.<br />      Copyright 1949 by Charles Scribner's Sons.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Back in 1949-before factory farming and the "pump 'em      full of chemicals" school of agriculture blitzed the      country-a fellow named Jack Widmer wrote a little      book called PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY. Now that manual      wasn't what you'd call completely exhaustive, the writing      style wasn't the best and a few of the ideas it      advanced-such as confining laying hens in cages-were      later refined into the kind of automated farming that so      many of us are fighting against these days.    </p>    <p>      Still, PRACTICAL ANIMAL HUSBANDRY contained a good deal of      basic information that today's "homesteaders" all too often      need and don't know where to find. I'm pleased, then, that      the publisher of the book, Charles Scribner's Sons, has      granted me permission to reprint excerpts from this      out-of-print manual. I think that many of my readers will      find the following information both interesting and      informative.-MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      As meat animals, hogs make more rapid gains, for the feed      consumed, than any other members of the home barnyard.      Seven-month-old hogs weighing 220 pounds (an ideal      butchering weight) are not at all unusual, and contrary to      general belief, one need not live in a corn-producing area      to be successful with porkers, either on a commercial      scale, or for the production of excellent meat for the      table. Then, too, the feeding of one or two pigs for home      consumption eliminates the necessity of edible garbage      removal, furnishes profitable animals for the consumption      of skim milk, whey or buttermilk, and produces the fine      hams, bacons and fresh cuts that have made pork the      favorite meat of rural America.    </p>    <p>      As to feeds necessary for the finishing of hogs, all manner      of grains, sorghums, peanuts, acorns, hay and permanent      pastures are ideal and there are few farms, be they large      or small, that do not waste enough garbage, milk products      and roughage that would make the feeding of a limited      number of pigs a profitable enterprise.    </p>    <p>      Despite many people's objections to the odors produced by      the hog lot, there is no necessity for this obnoxious      aroma, for hogs if given half a chance are fundamentally      clean animals with most objectionable odors being the fault      of man rather than that of the porkers themselves. Then      too, expensive feeding arrangements are not at all      necessary and if feeding utensils are kept clean, and if      hogs are supplied with a reasonable amount of fresh      bedding, they will be found no more objectionable than      other members of the home barnyard.    </p>    <p>      From a dollar and cent angle, the hog is by far the most      valuable of farm animals, will reproduce and fatten rapidly      ... surplus animals always find a ready market and have      done much to eliminate farm mortgages as well as helping to      pay taxes on non-commercial establishments.    </p>    <p>      For the country liver who is not interested in producing      more pork than he and his family can readily consume it      might not prove profitable for him to maintain a sow and to      produce his own pigs. Instead he may find it more      advantageous to purchase one or two 40- to 60-pound pigs      (sometimes referred to as shoats), to fatten them, have      them butchered and then to start afresh with another pair      of young animals.    </p>    <p>      Yet, if one should have considerable feed on hand, and one      agrees with us here on Toowoomba that little pigs are a joy      and delight, then perhaps one should maintain a sow and      dispose of surplus pigs either at weaning time (about eight      weeks of age) or, if grains are readily available, to      fatten a dozen, as readily as one or two, and to sell off      the surplus as butcher hogs weighing in the neighborhood of      200 pounds.    </p>    <p>      The decisions as to whether one should feed just enough for      home consumption or to maintain a sow or two will be an      individual problem and will be contingent on amount of feed      available, price of such feed, price of finished porkers,      availability of alfalfa or clover pasture, time that one      wishes to devote to hog production, etc. Yet if the      agriculturist (either amateur or professional) should      decide to go into hog production from the womb to the      deepfreeze (as it were) then a short study of breeding      stock will not be amiss.    </p>    <h3>      FOUNDATION STOCK    </h3>    <p>      We have stated under Sheep Production <strong><em>(The      chapter on raising sheep from Mr. Widmer's book will be      printed in a forthcoming issue-MOTHER.)</em></strong>      that it is not always necessary, nor even advisable to      purchase purebred foundation stock. However, in the case of      hogs, it is recommended that the producer always invest his      capital in registered stock. Costs are not excessively high      and the advantages of starting with firstclass breeding      stock are tremendous over that of starting with inferior      sows and attempting to "breed up" over a period of several      generations.    </p>    <p>      As to breed purchased, this choice will be influenced by      two major factors: [1] the breed most readily available in      any given community and [2] the type of hogs that are to be      produced and the purpose for which they are to be used.    </p>    <p>      Swine breeds are divided into two major categories: [1]      lard hogs and [2] bacon hogs. Poland China, Chester White      and Duroc-Jersey are the leading lard hog breeds, while      bacon hogs are represented by the Hampshire, Tamworth and      Yorkshire. Here on Toowoomba, where we are interested      primarily in bacon and ham production for our own table      rather than in excessive lard that most "lard" varieties      produce, we favor the long-bodied Hampshire with its      tremendous length of bacon and its ability to carry more      lean meat than fat and we are most happy with the "Canadian      Bacon" that we fashion from the pork loins of these      handsome animals. Yet again this will be a personal choice      and the amateur who is interested mainly in home production      for home consumption will do well to consider both types      before purchasing his sow or sows. But regardless of type      or breed, one should select the finest individuals      available even though the original cost may be a few      dollars higher. It is always to be remembered that even      though but one sow is purchased the speculative chances are      excellent that she will produce some gilts (young females)      that will be maintained on the farm and she will therefore      influence the type of hogs produced for years to come.    </p>    <p>      The beginner may find it simpler and safer to purchase      either bred sows or gilts. In this way he will avoid the      necessity of either maintaining or borrowing the services      of a boar, and by careful selection he may purchase a good      young female who is already carrying a litter.    </p>    <p>      She should be of good quality, showing considerable      femininity. She should be judged much in the manner as the      horse as to leg development, for she will be asked to carry      considerable weight and her legs must be strong, straight      and long enough so that her udder will not drag on the      ground when she is producing milk. Attention should also be      given her disposition for it is sometimes necessary for an      attendant to be present and helpful during farrowing time      and a sow of poor disposition will fight a man and will      sometimes devour her litter. She should be of arched back      and she should be of smooth flesh evenly layered over her      entire body. The seller should also be asked to produce      proof that she has been vaccinated for hog cholera and to      guarantee that she be fertile and free from worms.    </p>    <p>      In order to assure large litters the sow should have at      least six teats on each side, and if possible the      prospective purchaser should examine her dam and sire to      see that quality carries throughout the family. She should      not have been bred previous to her eighth month and many      hog fanciers prefer to wait until a young gilt has reached      a year of age before taking her to the boar.    </p>    <p>      In the event that unbred females are purchased and it      becomes necessary either to purchase a boar or to select a      male for boar service from a neighbor, it might not be      amiss to mention that the average sow will settle more      readily if the boar is brought to the sow rather than      transporting the sow to the boar.    </p>    <p>      In the event that the country dweller is interested in the      hog business to the extent of maintaining four or more sows      it would pay him to maintain his own boar. On the other      hand if he maintains but one or two females then it would      not be economical to feed a male the year around. Instead,      he will find it necessary to rely upon a neighbor, or as is      often the case he may go into a small neighborhood      cooperative, along with several of his neighbors, in the      purchase of a male.    </p>    <p>      The boar should show marked masculinity. He should have a      strong, wide head, a well-crested neck and stand squarely      on good strong legs with predominant strength evidenced in      the pasterns. He should be well developed in the sexual      organs and inasmuch as he must be handled often, one should      be most careful to select a boar that displays a docile      disposition. He should not be selected until he is at least      eight months of age and he should not be asked to breed      until he is at least a year old.    </p>    <h3>      BREEDING AND FARROWING    </h3>        <p>      Usually one breeding per sow is all that is required to get      her with pig. As already stated she should not be bred      until she is at least eight months of age and young boars      (under two years old) should not be asked to breed more      than one sow daily throughout the breeding season. In the      case of older boars, and if many sows are to be bred, he      may be used twice daily ... early morning and late evening.    </p>    <p>      Sows and boars should not be permitted to run together. On      the contrary, they are kept apart until the sow comes in      season. The boar is then brought to her and she is bred in      a small pen. She should not he asked to produce more than      one litter per year until she is at least two years old, by      which time she may safely produce a litter in the spring,      and a second in the fall. She should have a productive life      of at least eight years and if given proper care will have      produced in the neighborhood of a hundred pigs during this      relatively short span of life. No wonder hogs are often      called the "mortgage lifters".    </p>    <p>      A sow will ordinarily farrow in about 112 days after the      day of her last breeding, and by keeping careful records of      dates of breeding and by using the following gestation      table, the day that the sow is due is easily computed.    </p>    <p>      During the gestation period the ration for the sow should      be one rich in proteins, with not too much grain feed so as      to eliminate danger of her becoming too fat. Sows should be      allowed to run in large enough paddocks or pastures to      ensure ample exercise, and in the case of sows who are      raising but one fitter annually, little is needed in the      ration except good alfalfa pasture or some other succulent.      For sows who are producing two fitters each year, more      grain must be fed but the beginner must be cautioned      against overfeeding as heavy fat has a tendency to      complicate parturition. They should never be fed more than      2-1/2 pounds of grain daily for each 100 pounds of live      weight. An ideal mixture being as follows:<br />      Corn or ground barley ............................... 6      parts<br />      Oats .................................................4      parts<br />      Tankage or meat meal .................................1 part<br />      <br />      Tankage makes an excellent protein supplement for hogs. It      is the resulting product when packing houses process meat      scraps, fat trimmings and scrap bones. This mixture is      cooked in large tanks, the fat is skimmed off and the      result sold to hog producers as either tankage or meat      meal.    </p>    <p>      This ration may be increased or decreased depending on      pasture or hay available ... a good guide for the beginner      be ing that sows should be kept in a thrifty condition but      never permitted to become fat or sluggish. If skim milk is      available, 10 pounds of skim milk replaces 1 pound of      tankage or meat meal.    </p>    <p>      As the date of impending parturition approaches, each      individual sow should be taken from the herd at least five      days previous to her "time" and should be placed in a      farrowing pen. This pen should be at least ten feet square      and adequate shelter (at least seven feet square) should be      provided. These shelters need not be expensively      constructed. All that is required is a place out of drafts      with solid flooring (either concrete, wood or packed earth)      that can be easily sterilized after each farrowing. A      "bumper board," usually a 2 X 12 placed edgeways around the      shelter about six inches off the floor, will give the pigs      a chance to avoid being crushed when the sow rolls over.      This should be installed and the sow supplied with enough      straw bedding so that she may make her own nest.    </p>    <p>      Usually, assistance from man is not necessary. However, a      sow should be watched closely during parturition so that if      a pig is presented backwards (hind feet foremost) or in the      event that the sow is overly clumsy and is apt to squash      her pigs, a helping hand may be offered by man in picking      up the pigs and showing them the teat. Some breeders,      living in very cold localities provide small electrically      heated "brooders" for each litter, while others insist that      the sow knows her business and should, in the main, be left      to herself.    </p>    <p>      For the first two days after farrowing, sows will have      little desire for feed and will usually be content with      lukewarm water, or they may be interested in a warm bran      mash during the morning of the second day. After that the      sow will show a strong desire for food and she may be      started off on about three pounds of grain daily which may      gradually be increased until she is on full feed (all the      grain she will clean up) by the time the pigs are two weeks      old.    </p>    <p>      Weak or orphaned pigs may be raised successfully on cows'      milk fed with a nursing bottle ... however, healthy sows      that have healthy pigs will require nothing but feed and      water and the best pasture available.    </p>    <p>      An excellent grain mixture for sows while suckling pigs is:   </p><p>Corn or ground barley .............................. 6 parts <br />	 Oats ...................................................... 1 part<br />    Shorts ....................................................2 parts<br />    Tankage or meat meal ......................................1 part<br /></p>    <p>      Sows should be watched for condition and fed enough to keep      their milk at maximum production during this all-important      phase.    </p>    <p>      During the suckling period a creep which bars the sow but      allows the pigs to enter may be built. The little porkers      should be fed a grain mixture of:<br />      Corn or ground barley ............................... 10      parts<br />      Shorts ................................................4 parts<br />      Tankage or meat meal ..................................1      part<br />      Oats (either rolled or ground) .........................2      parts<br />      <br /></p>      <p>For those interested in fattening but one or two hogs per      year, commercial feeds may be used to an advantage as it      will not then be necessary to mix feeds for the hogs.    </p><p><strong>THE FINISHED PRODUCT</strong></p>    <p>      It is interesting to note that the hog is the rare      exception in the animal kingdom ... he will not overeat.      For this reason it is unnecessary to give rations in daily      amounts, for hogs may be self-fed ... a method which      reduces costs of labor and removes all possibilities of      under or over feeding.    </p>    <p>      Inexpensive self-feeders may be made by anyone who is at      all handy with tools, the principle being that the      self-feeder is merely a grain container with outlets into a      small trough at its base which refills itself as the grain      level is lowered by the animals. In this manner, regardless      of what grain mixture is fed, it is kept before sow and      pigs at all times. All that is required of the husbandryman      is to keep grain in the feeder and supply ample water and      minerals.    </p>    <p>      All pigs should be vaccinated against hog cholera at 10      weeks of age and all male pigs should be castrated while      still suckling their dams. At the babies' weaning time      (about 12 weeks) when they weigh about 35 lbs., grains fed      the sow should be cut down so that her milk supply will dry      up, while the pigs themselves are continued on their      self-fed grain until they have attained the weight of      butcher hogs.    </p>    <p>      In the event that the sow's udder should become caked due      to the unwillingness of her milk supply to stop at weaning      time, she should be milked out once or twice by returning      her litter to her for a few minutes. It is seldom necessary      to repeat this operation more than twice.    </p>    <p>      For those who have purchased pigs rather than raising them,      the same general practices may be followed in finishing the      animals as with those home raised. Satisfactory gains can      be made from feeding 350 to 400 pounds of grain plus 25 to      35 pounds of tankage per 100 pounds of live weight gain,      and if hogs have this grain together with the tankage      available in self-feeders (or in one main feeder with two      compartments), they will balance their own diets by eating      exactly the proper amounts of both grain and tankage to      make up a proper ration.    </p>    <p>      The remainder of hog production is merely waiting until the      hogs show the proper and desired degree of finish. Hogs      that have been fed on peanuts or some other "soft"      concentrate, instead of grain, should be fed corn or some      other grain during the last three weeks of the fattening      program so as to harden the flesh. In lard hogs many      breeders permit their hogs to attain a weight of 250      pounds, while others, desiring more lean meat, prefer to      butcher below that weight. For bacon type hogs, we prefer      to butcher at no heavier than 220 pounds and have had ideal      results with our hams and bacons at that weight.    </p>    <p>      In the event that the breeder wishes to save some of the      gilts of the litter for replacements in the breeding herd,      he should separate them from the fattening stock before      they attain a weight of 150 pounds. They do not require as      much feed as a fattening hog (for after all we are mainly      interested in a growing ration), and a ration made up as      follows, and fed at the rate of 2-1/2 pounds of grain for      each 100 pounds of live weight, is ideal.<br />      Corn or ground barley      ...................................... 6 parts<br />      Oats      ............................................................      4 parts<br />      Tankage      ....................................................... 1      part<br />    </p>    <p>      This mixture is fed until the gilts attain eight months to      one year of age and they are then bred and fed the same      general rations as the sows.    </p>    <p>      It might be mentioned that com-on-the-cob makes excellent      hog feed. When this is fed, weights of corn should be      increased by one-fourth, allowing for the weight of the      cob. Many hog fanciers feed corn in this manner and the      hogs seem to enjoy eating the Corn from the cob, thus      saving the expense of corn shelling.    </p>					 <p>      <strong>MINERALS FOR HOGS</strong><br />    </p>       	        <p>      Minerals must be supplied to all hogs. Common salt is      required in the ration (as it is with all animals) and      other minerals should be supplied as needed. Excellent      commercial hog mineral mixtures may be purchased in any      good feed store, and this is by far the easiest method of      obtaining the supplement. However, the mineral requirements      of any given locality may differ from that of another and      so it might be wise for the hog producer to check with his      local county agent so as to determine what minerals are      needed in his area.    </p>
