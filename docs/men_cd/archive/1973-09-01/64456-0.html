        Foundation and first walls of the house under construction. First chimney of rammed earth blocks being finished off (concrete blocks would have been better for this purpose). Rammed earth block foundation for the chimney. Steel reinforcing rods in the foundation don are recommended for earth buildings constructed in areas that experience frost. The finished house. Forms and tamp used in construction. Wetting down walls after forms have been removed. Building a rammed earth structure if not at all a complicated undertaking ... but it is a labor-intensive job.
