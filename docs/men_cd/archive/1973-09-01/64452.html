                 		     <h5 id="byline">      by BARBARA BAMBINGER    </h5>           <p>      We may well have had the smallest pumpkin patch in Quebec      last fall ... but even so, its productivity overwhelmed us.      We'd never grown the crop before and hadn't expected the      ines to proliferate so generously.   </p>    <p>      We were pleased with our success but at the same time in a      quandary as to what could be done with our healthy harvest.      How were two stomachs going to dispose of 21 "symbols of      harvest" before the first frost? Making one jack-o'-lantern      and giving three pumpkins to each of our two neighbors      still left us with 14 offspring ... not enough to set up a      stall in the market, but far too many to convert into pies.    </p>    <p>      To the rescue (for the thousand-and-first time) our French      neighbor! ... who informed us that in the old country      pumpkins are used to create delicate soufflés,      hearty soups, intriguing main or side dishes and an endless      variety of desserts. Sure enough. With just a little      effort, we soon found more pumpkin recipes from all over      the world than we were able to try with only 14 of the      delicious gourds.    </p>    <p>      Pumpkin is as rich in its challenge to creative cooks as it      is in vitamin A. Being rather bland, the pulp lends itself      beautifully to stuffings, spice mixtures and imaginative      combinations. One pound serves two people generously.    </p>    <p>      To steam pumpkin, clean and peel the fruit and cut it into      small pieces. Cook the chunks in a covered pan, along with      a small amount of water, until they're tender ... 25-35      minutes. Serve the dish with butter and a dash of nutmeg,      or mashed in place of potatoes.    </p>    <p>      To bake one of the gourds, slice it in half or cut a lid      from its top, and clean out the inner seeds and pulp. Brush      the inside with butter and sprinkle it with brown sugar or      pumpkin spices. Set the golden globe in a 350° oven      until it's tender ... about an hour if the fruit is whole,      less if it's cut in small pieces.    </p>    <p>      Pumpkins can be used interchangeably in recipes which call      for winter squash. Here are just a few of the many other      possible ways to prepare this truly international      comestible (all recipes serve six):    </p>
