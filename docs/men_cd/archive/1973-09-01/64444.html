                    <h5 id="byline">      by ROBIN RYE    </h5>		<hr />    <p>      If you're thinking of getting started with sheep, I envy      you the adventure ... and maybe I can help you to avoid      some of the misadventures.    </p>    <p>      My own life with the woolies began 25 years ago when I      brought five sheep home to the farm in a station wagon. The      road ran through a hilly town, and-as the car      followed the ups and downs of the terrain-my      introduction to the creatures was the sight in the      rear-vision mirror of horns sliding toward the back of my      head.    </p>    <p>      The next few days brought both joy and sorrow. One of the      ewes suddenly gave birth to a lamb out of season, and all      the other sheep sickened. I leaned on the fence rails and      wept while my flock died.    </p>    <p>      Then I did what I should have done in the first place: I      visited the county agent and did some research on my own.      Although I had lived in the country all my life I didn't      know a thing about sheep, and now I admitted it. (Lesson      One: Never buy animals out of a strange flock unless you      check them first for internal parasites.)    </p>    <p>      My second little flock of four were Suffolks, long-legged,      strong and springy. I watched while they leaped 46-inch      fences, sold them to someone else the next day and bought      half a dozen clean Hampshires ... the breed I've raised to      this day.    </p>    <h3>      WHY SHEEP?    </h3>    <p>      I'm not writing this for people who want to go into show      sheep, or any other kind of sheep <em>business.</em> My      suggestions are for the contemporary homesteader who just      wants to raise a few of the animals.    </p>    <p>      If you live on the land, there are four healthy reasons for      bringing woolies onto your place and making them a part of      your own earth-family: [ 1 ] Sheep are good meat producers.      If lamb isn't your bag, you can sell the young of your      flock and spend the money on some other meat. Put that on      your table with your cost-free vegetables and you'll have      balanced your diet and your budget too. [2] Sheep will keep      all your fields, fence lines and yards clean and trim. [3]      They're the easiest of all barnyard animals to handle      physically, to pasture, feed and house. [4] Your flock will      provide a very valuable manure as composit for the garden.    </p>    <p>      Then, of course, there's the wonder of wool. How far you go      with it depends on your circumstances and temperament. You      can make some small money off the shearings ... or you can      explore, as I did, the whole fascinating gamut of      handspinning and weaving. Try it if you can.    </p>    <p>      Also, if you butcher out your own mutton, save some whole      sheepskins and tan them yourself. It's really not difficult      to have beautiful fleece rugs and covers for practically no      cost at all.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, you'll just plain love sheep. You'll never again      call anyone "muttonhead" and you'll learn what it really      means to "get fleeced". Your sympathy will be all with the      woolies. Inevitably, they bring wonderment to a landscape      and to your peaceful life there.    </p>    <h3>      COSTS    </h3>    <p>      I can swear-after 25 years of experience-that      if you grow all your own hay and grain, a flock of sheep      will not only keep your place trim, clean and manured but      will also provide you with your entire meat supply (from      lamb or lamb money) for practically nothing. For many years      before I achieved this stage of enlightened      self-sufficiency, I had a compromise arrangement: Every      season I let out a 12-acre field for cash-cropping      (following conservation practices set down by me) in      exchange for my woolies' grain or hay needs or their cash      equivalent. Life is much easier now that I personally raise      the feed for my sheep.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT BREED?    </h3>    <p>      To find out the kind of sheep that's best for you, haunt      county fairs and do a little reading. You have plenty of      choice: the Suffolk produces bigger lambs, the Corriedale      has the best fleece, the Hampshire twins over 50% of the      time, the Dorset has horns ... and there's a lot more to be      learned. Pick your own breed ... which, in the long run,      means "pick the one you just naturally like best". It's a      little like getting married.    </p>    <p>      It's generally a waste of money to buy registered stock for      the homestead flock, but do get a good ram (he'll serve      30-40 ewes). An unregistered purebred male can be      purchased for about $30.00 ... half the price of one that's      listed with the breeders' association. <em>(I</em>      <em>should point out that this article was written over a      year ago and prices of all farm animals-including      sheep-have risen sharply during the past few      months.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Get two-year-old ewes-no younger, no older-to      begin with. About $15.00 a head is a good medium price. By      the way, if you have to choose between ewes of different      ages, always pick the older. Very young females often don't      make good mothers ... as if to say clearly that they're not      ready to settle down yet.    </p>    <p>      Always check sheep for evidence of internal parasites:      diarrhea or a dirty rear end, pale, papery-white skin at      the base of the wool and paleness inside the eyelids (the      latter two conditions are both symptoms of anemia). Check      even if it insults the seller. His outrage will eventually      give way to respect.    </p>    <p>      How many sheep should you buy? One acre of ground will      support four or five ewes and their lambs (roughly      speaking, and depending on what grows on the land). Don't      get too large a flock, but also remember that it takes no      more time and energy to feed a dozen sheep in the winter      than it does to feed six.    </p>    <h3>      FENCING    </h3>        <p>      The first thing your new sheep will do is check every inch      of your fence line, excitedly but methodically. Barbed wire      or electric fencing won't keep your flock from running (the      animals will go right through them) ... such enclosures      will just keep YOU running after the flock. It's not that      the woolies really hanker to go anywhere. I think they just      want to find out how smart you are. Once they      know-after about half an hour-they'll      immediately settle down to grazing on your place for the      rest of their lives.    </p>    <p>      If you want to pass that initial test with minimum strain,      get at least 36"-high woven wire fence and support it with      a post set about every ten or fifteen feet. Those uprights      can be the light metal kind along the run of fencing, but      at the corners you'll have to install strong wooden corner      posts and braces. Set all uprights at least three feet      deep, stretch the wire very tight and don't string the      fence more than four inches off the ground (or little lambs      will get out under it).    </p>    <p>      On my place I've established about a mile of multiflora,      rose hedge from plants obtained at cost from the state      Natural Resources Department. In ten years these bushes      have produced (except in shady spots) a good sheep-fast      fence which is also dogproof and wonderful wildlife cover.    </p>    <h3>      PASTURE    </h3>    <p>      Another entire article could be written about types of      pasture and management, and you'll find plenty to read on      the subject. I'll just mention the basics.    </p>    <p>      Sheep are comparatively inexpensive to feed, but-like      any domestic animal-they must <em>be</em> fed ... they have      to eat more than weeds. A homestead or farm is not a      wilderness, and life in confinement is less rich and      balanced than life in the state of nature.    </p>    <p>      In the main, a good <em>mixture</em> of grasses and legumes      is best <em>...</em> half grass, half clover, for instance.      The woolies tend to get colic from timothy in its older      growth.    </p>    <p>      Sheep are ruminants: they have a stomach divided into four      chambers and chew a cud. Like other animals of this      type-cows, for example-they may run into      trouble when one of the compartments (the rumen) fills with      gas. On very lush pasture, like almost solid alfalfa or      clover (especially when the fodder is wet with rain or      dew), a grazing sheep can bloat and promptly drop dead of a      heart attack. Unless you regularly disobey the rules of      good feeding, however, bloat is not a frequent occurrence.    </p>    <p>      Fifteen years ago I planted twelve acres of bird's-foot      trefoil, a comparatively new legume which is bloatproof and      even higher in protein content than alfalfa. That crop is      still producing good pasture here today. The seed is a      little expensive, but try the plant if you can. It likes a      clay subsoil and a light companion crop (in my case,      one-fourth bluegrass). Bird's-foot trefoil is not pastured      until its second year of growth. After that, if it's not      being grazed, it will produce about two tons of very      superior hay per acre.    </p>    <p>      Sheep, in general, won't eat poisonous plants such as      wilted wild cherry, the toxic parts of pokeweed (inkberry),      buckeye seeds, rhubarb leaves, toadstools, nightshade, etc.      But keep your place clear of these menaces anyway      <em>...</em> and <em>never</em> dump old paint cans where      any livestock can get at them. I've seen literally dozens      of sheep and cattle killed by their peculiar appetite for      the lead found in many protective coatings <em>...</em> all      because someone threw his refuse out on the land.    </p>    <p>      Woolies generally rest from grazing during the heat of the      day, and pasture very early in the mornings and very late      into the evenings and the earlier part of the night. After      a while you'll be able to throw away your big wristwatch      and know almost exactly what time it is by the comings and      goings of your flock.    </p>    <h3>      HOUSING    </h3>        <p>      Simple, well-lighted, well-ventilated and dry <em>...</em>      that almost says it all. Allow about 15 square feet per      animal. Overcrowding must be avoided for several reasons,      one of which is that pregnant ewes may abort from crowding      through narrow door ways. Also, unless they've just been      sheared, your sheep are wearing from four to twelve pounds      (depending on the time of year) of warm wool apiece.      Overheating combined with sudden cold snaps can breed      pneumonia in a flock.    </p>    <p>      Leave the shelter open at all times <em>...</em> sheep like      to go in and out of their house at their own will. Expect      them to stay inside during the heat of day and to lie down      perversely outside in the snow.    </p>    <p>      Sheep are afraid of dark places <em>...</em> and after      they've been yours for a while they won't go into their      shed at all for sometime after <em>anyone</em> strange has      been in it.    </p>    <p>      My sheep shelter has a concrete floor. That arrangement      won't result in a cold, damp or soggy condition if you      always put down two or three feet of loose bedding when the      stable is new-or right after it has been      cleaned-and if you keep adding fresh material      regularly. (Fallen leaves in autumn are great for this      purpose, and it's a simple way to compost them      automatically.)    </p>    <p>      Neither your nose nor your feet will be offended in a      well-managed sheep stable <em>...</em> the manure is      pelleted, relatively dry and light in weight. Let all that      good organic fertilizing material-manure plus      bedding-accumulate to a compacted depth of about two      feet: That is, clean out the shelter about once a year. The      concrete flooring keeps the nutrients from leaching out of      the pellets and the old hay from being tramped into the      ground <em>...</em> whereas, if you fork the stuff out into      a pile, over half the plant food in the soiled bedding will      be washed away by rain or snow and lost (unless, of course,      you always clean the shed directly onto your garden). The      deep, composting mass in your stable also creates a      valuable source of natural warmth during severely cold      weather, when most of your lambs will be born.    </p>    <p>      Later on you'll want small maternity centers for new      mothers and their babies. If you can't have permanent pens,      gates that hinge to the walls and can be taken down and      stored after lambing season will do very well.    </p>    <h3>      WINTER FEED    </h3>        <p>      In winter one woolie will eat about three pounds of hay and      about one pound of grain a day.    </p>    <p>      Start feeding your sheep hay in the fall as soon as they      show any appetite for it. It's as simple as that. Knowing      when to withdraw the dry roughage and grain in the spring      is even simpler: When green-up time comes for sure, all      your woolies will look, one day, as if they were thinking      of leaving home. They'll stare at you as if they didn't      know who you were. Then they'll put their noses down into      the grass and you can call all you like ... but they won't      come. Hang up the hay hooks and put away the feed buckets      that very day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HAY.</strong> The hay you use should be a good      grass-legume mixture. Judge the fodder you buy by its      scent, color and leafiness ... and avoid all non-leguminous      hays and any that are pale or moldy.    </p>    <p>      Hay should be tightly baled for easiest handling (twine is      easier to manage than wire) and-whenever      possible-you should purchase by weight, not by the      bale. Always allow plenty of air to circulate around your      stored fodder, and keep it absolutely dry to avoid both      mold and the danger of fire from spontaneous combustion.      Rock salt spread between some of the bales keeps down      heating if you're especially worried about this      self-ignition in very new hay.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRAIN.</strong> I start feeding grain rations late      in November here in Ohio. Mix your own if you      can-equal parts of cracked corn, wheat and      oats-and avoid commercial formulas which are      expensive and loaded with fillers, hormones, antibiotics      and other harmful and unnecessary chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Never overfeed or free-feed sheep on grain. This can      founder and kill them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FEEDING ARRANGEMENTS.</strong> You can feed your      sheep either in the shed or outdoors. In winter two meals a      day are preferable-one in the morning and a second      late in the afternoon-but if you keep their      hay-feeders constantly full you can safely cut the animals      to a one-a-day grain ration.    </p>    <p>      The hayracks you build should be about three feet high (for      easy top-loading) and should have their feeder openings      spaced about 12 inches apart. If you make the gaps between      the bars too wide, the animals will pull out and waste a      lot of hay (sheep won't eat trampled fodder) ... and if you      set them too close together your woolies will get their      heads caught between the slats and be miserable until you      come to rescue them. (Sheep will also sometimes get their      heads lodged like this between fence-wire openings.)    </p>    <p>      It's thoughtful to position a hay-feeder so that your flock      can feed from all sides of the rack.      Everyone-around-the-table is better than an automat line,      even for sheep. The same holds true for the grainfeeding      arrangement, which should consist of simple long metal      troughs spread about on the floor or ground. Avoid the      crowded cafeteria fight-to-eat situation ... animals don't      like it any better than humans do.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SALT AND WATER</strong> should be available to your      woolies at all times. In the winter, put a small log in the      watering trough to keep the liquid from freezing hard.    </p>    <h3>      LAMBING    </h3>    <p>      Sheep begin breeding with the first cold snap in the fall.      You <em>can</em> control the time of lambing by restraining      the ram-separating him-and by making him wear a      "marking-harness" ... but I think it's better to leave your      sheep alone as much as possible. Nature is wiser and      happier than commerce.    </p>    <p>      Lambs are carried about five months. You can generally tell      when a ewe is ready to drop her young by checking her      udder. If the expectant mother's bag contains even a little      squirt of milk she'll usually give birth in 36 hours or      less. If she deliberately skips a feeding, you can count on      a new baby (or babies) within two to four hours.    </p>    <p>      A ewe should not be in labor more than four hours at the      longest. When one of your flock is slow to give birth,      check on the position of the lamb ... normal delivery takes      place feet first with the head between the forelegs. If you      can feel or see that this is not the case get a pair of      rubber gloves, a bucket of boiling water, some pure linseed      oil, a good lantern-flash light, a pair of scissors, a      wide-mouthed bottle of iodine and a helper if possible ...      and get moving.    </p>    <p>      Sheep have difficulty during approximately one out of every      four lambings, and you can learn more about complicated      deliveries than I can tell you here by watching a good      veterinarian or another shepherd. The general procedure is      to scald the gloves and coat them with oil, deliver the      lamb, cut the cord about 4" long and dunk it well in the      iodine. Then check the ewe's womb for the detachable      afterbirth and the presence of a second or third baby.      Immediately remove all mucus from the little one's mouth      and nose and see that the baby is breathing freely (it's a      good sign if the lamb begins to cry within five minutes of      birth). The teats on the mother's udder should be open and      full and you should trim away any tags (wool wads and      strings) from around her bag ... if you didn't-more      wisely-do this ahead of time.    </p>    <p>      When a lambing situation looks especially difficult, call a      vet. This is only fair to the ewe and lamb in your charge,      and at the same time you'll learn far more from observing a      professional make the delivery than you'll pay in money.    </p>    <p>      After a birth watch to see if the ewe "mothers" the lamb:      talks to it in a low grumble and garble and nudges under      its tail with her mouth to encourage it to nurse. Don't      fondle or play with the newborn at this stage, or its dam      may disown it. In fact, don't upset a new mother in any way      ... she's nervous and afraid of you as it is.    </p>    <p>      Give the freshly delivered ewe tepid water and about half a      pound of oats. Avoid corn, which is heating, since the      female is a little feverish at this point. Keep the      hay-feeder full in her small private stall.    </p>    <p>      A new mother has an endearing and somewhat pitiful      mannerism of stamping hard with her forefeet at you or      anything else which she senses as dangerous to her lamb.      Although the ewe is capable, at close quarters, of slamming      you against the barn wall with her head, sheep are not      dangerous and this stamping is about all she can manage in      the way of defense. Honor her gesture ... it shows that      she's a good mother and is trying hard.    </p>    <p>      In severe weather (or, frequently, in the case of twins)      you may have a chilled, weak lamb to care for. Though some      shepherds keep electric warming lamps in the barn, I have      always used the door of my oven in the kitchen to deal with      this emergency. Turn the oven on only to medium, to avoid      overheating the baby. Open the door, lay the patient on it      and rub the baby <em>damp</em> -dry. Work swiftly. Then,      using a bottle tipped with a nipple, get one ounce of warm      milk (half whole and half condensed) into the lamb. Wait an      hour before giving the baby more: It's very easy to      overfeed a new lamb and kill it with colic. As soon as the      baby has taken even one ounce of food, get it back to its      mother.    </p>    <p>      Don't clean a lamb or touch it under its tail ... mother      woolie identifies her own by a scent there, not by sight.      If this odor is removed or replaced by your own smell, the      ewe may disown her young. In case of trouble, put some of      the dam's own milk under her baby's tail. This is usually      sufficient to fool her.    </p>    <p>      Once you've warmed and started the lamb, it ought to take      up nursing on its own. Check every hour to see whether it      does. If the newborn baby is particularly hard to start (if      it's still not suckling independently), add half a teaspoon      of maple syrup to the bottle milk and feed the lamb another      ounce of the fluid in an hour.    </p>    <p>      On occasion a ewe will die or deliberately disown her      newborn, and you'll have a real bottle baby on your hands.      Feed it every two hours, night and day, one ounce at a      time, for the first 24 hours. Then go to two ounces and      keep this up every two hours around the clock for a week.      Finally increase the baby's ration to four ounces per      feeding, every four hours, for twelve hours a day.      <em>Never, never get too enthusiastic and step up the      quantities of milk. No matter how strong the lamb</em>      <em>seems, you'll kill it in minutes.</em>    </p>    <h3>      DISEASES AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES    </h3>    <p>      You won't be counting sheep at night now ... but      <em>always</em> count your real sheep every day, whether      you have four or forty.    </p>    <p>      A sheep alone is a sick sheep. Check it out immediately.    </p>    <p>      Your woolies bunched up, close together out in the field,      may be in trouble. Check on them at once.    </p>    <p>      Then there are dogs. I hate to kill anything, but I still      have a little shotgun in the corner of my bedroom and a      quick ear even when I'm asleep.    </p>    <p>      Bell some of your fleecy charges so you'll be able to keep      track of them when they're out of sight. The sound will      also tell you when dogs are into the flock ... nothing is      more alarming to a good shepherd than the jangling of bells      on running sheep.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes your woolies will come up lame from stepping in      holes in their pasture. If you see one limping, inspect its      hoof and-if it isn't cut and there's no thorn or      pebble lodged in the foot-don't worry. During my      first year as a shepherd I tried to stand lame sheep in      buckets of Epsom salts. Invariably, the animals kicked over      the pails and went limping on their way until, in a few      days, the sprains got well.    </p>    <p>      On very wet, low land or in very rainy seasons sheep can      develop hoof rot. Although this is rare, it does explain      why the creatures all have a deep dislike for mud and are      born puddle jumpers.    </p>    <p>      Sheep have short legs-therefore, not much      leverage-and are shortwinded. Once in a while one may      somehow get down on its back in a low place and not be able      to get up by itself. Go out and right it before it bloats.    </p>    <p>      To control worms, feed your sheep green (phenothiazinized)      salt at all times, on a free-choice basis. Yes,      phenothiazine is a chemical, but in the present      environmental situation it's still necessary for full      control of internal parasites. I no longer, however, worm      my flock with a syringe twice a year. A consistent program      of pasture rotation, a fully adequate diet on unclosed,      organic feeds, and no overgrazing cuts the need for drugs      to this absolute minimum.    </p>    <h3>      HANDLING    </h3>    <p>      Don't get hurt feelings if your woolies never trust you      completely. Sheep (except for those that have been      bottleraised) never trust <em>anyone</em> completely.      You'll notice this skittishness even in lambs. By the      fourth or fifth day mother-woolie will have gotten the      message across to little-woolie ... and for you, chasing a      frisky five-day-old lamb around a barn lot will be like      pursuing a tiddlywink.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of mistrust, stay as close to your ram,      physically, as you possibly can. He gets his thrust and      lift-power from backing up, running and hitting you with      his head tucked neatly in under your bottom. I've had many      a trip over a 46" fence in just that way.    </p>    <p>      Woolies aren't a menace, though ... just a humiliation      sometimes. I've seen a grown man reach to pick up a thickly      fleeced (and lightweight, he thought) sheep and just stand      there like a tree rooted in the ground. The critters are      heavier than they look ... and smarter than they're      reported to be.    </p>    <p>      Intelligent or not, however, it is a fact that sheep are      difficult to doctor. At the slightest ailment or injury      they simply decide that the time has come to die. On the      other hand, they can show surprising strength of character:      I've had them stand still and look levelly at me with utter      snobbishness.    </p>    <p>      I never have my sheeps' tails docked nowadays. That painful      operation always was intended merely to enhance market      value and-supposedly-to keep rear ends cleaner      and make lambing easier on the herder. One still hears a      wild rumors-a rumor that's been around for hundreds      of years-that woolies can't breed unless they're      docked. This is sheer nonsense. The animal wags its tail      toward off flies and to express itself. Leave it on.    </p>    <p>      One final odd fact: Sheeps' eyes glow red in the dark.    </p>    <p>      Have I, perhaps, seemed to present more problems than      pleasures? Relax ... you now know the worst. The pleasures      you'll get for yourself, over and over and over.    </p>    <p>      Have a good life with the woolies. With the wider      distribution of man-made and chemical fibers, and with more      and more asphalting over of the green earth, they may      someday become a species just as endangered as your own.    </p>
