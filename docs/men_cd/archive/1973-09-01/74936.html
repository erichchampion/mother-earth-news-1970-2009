                        <p>      SPECIAL NOTE. <em>GROW IT!</em> is a big book and even if a      chunk this size were to be run in issue after issue after      issue of MOTHER, it would take over two years to put the      complete volume in your hands. If you haven't got two years      to play around with, we recommend that you truck on down to      your nearest book store and shell out $8.95 for your very      own copy of <em>GROW IT!</em> That way, Richard Langer will      be happy, Saturday Review Press will be happy ... and we're      betting that you'll be happy too. It's a darn good book.    </p>    <p>      EXTRA SPECIAL NOTE: All material here reprinted from GROW      IT! copy right a 1972 by Richard W. Langer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>At last! For the first time since the HAVE-MORE      Plan was published way back in the 1940's, a fellow named      Richard W. Langer has come up with a 365-page book that      really introduces a beginner to small-scale farming. Wanna      raise your own fruit, nuts, berries, vegetables, grain,      chickens, pigs, ducks, geese and honeybees? <em>GROW      IT!</em> tells you how to get started, we like it, and      here's another chapter from the book.</strong>    </p>		<hr />    <h3>      nuts    </h3>		<hr />    <p>      <em><strong>He that plants trees loves others besides      himself.x<br />      -Old English Proverb<br /></strong></em>    </p>    <p>      A nut tree is one of the most valuable things your      homestead can have, not only for the high-protein fine      winter stores and excellent eating the nutbowl will      provide, but for its highly prized timber as well ... if it      absolutely must be felled. The American chestnut is no      more; the black walnut is not far behind in the race to      extinction.    </p>    <p>      Walnuts are among the most valued of all temperate      hardwoods, with a pair of good hundred-year-old trees worth      more in dollars and  cents than a whole furnished      ready-to-move-into two-bedroom ranch house. The problem is      it takes the tree that full hundred years to grow and only      a couple of hours to fell it. There is some hope for the      walnut, for people are beginning to wake up to the fact      that even if they receive no direct benefit from a tree      they plant, not even nuts for a dozen years or so, the      world is that much better off for their having planted it.      Granted there aren't too many people with this awareness      yet ... but at least there's hope.    </p>    <p>      The American chestnut situation is a little different. The      reason the village smithy no longer stands beneath its      spread, the automobile notwithstanding, is simply that the      species has been almost totally wiped out by blight, as has      the majestic American elm.    </p>    <p>      Had one fraction of the money spent on advertising by the      industries most responsible for using up trees - the paper,      housing, and furniture industries - been channeled into      blight research and reforestation, these trees could      probably both have been saved.    </p>    <p>      Be that as it may, not only the furniture and paper      industries, but also you as a farmer owe nature a few      trees. And your farm will only be the better for repaying a      bit of the debt. Filberts will give you a much quicker      yield than walnuts, but plant both where possible, along      with as many other varieties as you can. It's pretty hard      to harm anyone or anything by planting a tree, particularly      a nut tree.    </p>    <p>      Because of the alphabetical order the following trees got      themselves put into, the first couple may lead you to      despair of getting any nuts at all. Please read to the end      before you decide not to take even a nutcracker along to      the country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ALMOND</strong></p><p>      The almond, as you can tell by comparing one in its shell      with a peach stone, is a close relative of the peach. Both      belong to the greater rose family. Almonds come in bitter      and sweet varieties. For the nut bowl the sweet are grown      almost exclusively.    </p>    <p>      Although almonds will grow wherever peaches thrive, they      bloom almost a month earlier and thus are often subject to      spring chill. This means in many areas of late springs the      tree can be grown only for decorative purposes. There's      nothing wrong with that, however. If peaches grow, and if      you have the space, why not try an almond tree?    </p>    <p>      Plant in early spring. Just treat it like a peach tree.      Unless, of course, you want to heat your orchard the way      some commercial growers do where the chill is too much for      the blossoms. It's really not worth the work, however. Your      almond tree won't miss the nuts much, even if you do. And      on a northern slope the light will make it blossom a little      later. Even if it's likely that your springs are too late,      you might have an almond or two after all.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEECHNUT</strong></p><p>      Here's a nut tree from which you'll never get many nuts.      But it's a beautiful tree, and a boost to your wildlife.      Plant a couple of extra beechnuts on your "back forty" for      your children to make hand-hewn heirloom furniture from      when they have a homestead of their own.    </p>    <p>      The tree is very hardy and will grow in almost any soil but      that with poor drainage. However, since it is a      taproot-dependent tree, you have to transplant it early.      Also keep competing growth away from it for the first      couple of years. Then you can let it go wild. Dormant oil      spray in early spring, before the tree gets growing, is a      good idea, but a hundred-foot-tall tree is a bit hard to      spray, so you'll have to give up eventually.    </p>    <p>      If I had my way, everyone would be planting a beechnut,      hickory, or walnut tree every year to celebrate their      coming to the land. It doesn't take much time or money and      would make all the difference in the world ... to the      world.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHESTNUT</strong>    </p>    <p>      The American chestnut is dead, long live the Chinese      chestnut. Although a tiny, unimpressive runt when compared      with the majestic cathedral spread of the native chestnut,      the Chinese variety yields excellent large nuts and can be      grown in almost any part of the country. As with other      early-blooming trees, it is often advisable to plant on a      northern slope to delay flowering.    </p>    <p>      Several trees are needed to insure pollination. Of course,      you want to plant them in the same area, not at different      corners of your place. Twenty-five to thirty feet apart is      fine. In some cases they will yield as soon as three years      after planting, in most cases four years, and six years      after planting you'll have a bumper crop.    </p>    <p>      Mulching and deep, fertile, sandy loam with plenty of      organic matter are necessary. The Chinese chestnut wants a      lot of moisture, but it needs good drainage too. The roots      are more sensitive to standing water than those of most      trees.    </p>    <p>      Pruning and care are about the same as for your fruit      trees, except that you'll have to keep a sharp lookout for      root suckers unless you want to grow a bush instead of a      tree. Harvest nuts as they hit the ground. Don't let them      mold, which they'll do quickly left to their own devices.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FILBERT AND HAZELNUT</strong><br />      <br />      Your northern slope - or eastern, it serves almost the same      purpose-is getting crowded by now, because here's      another one that should be planted there to delay blooming.      Lest this make you think how bare your southern slope is      going to look in comparison, that's the best place for your      vegetable garden.    </p>    <p>      The difference between filberts and hazelnuts, in case      you're pondering on the matter, is that hazelnuts are      American while the filbert was imported from Europe.      Filberts in most cases produce bigger and better nuts. Both      are mostly shrubs rather than trees, although there are      some fifty-to sixty-foot members in the clan.    </p>    <p>      Plant whatever variety is grown locally. Usually this means      filberts in areas of milder winters and hazelnuts in the      colder regions. Get at least two varieties for      cross-pollination. Plant in early spring, using deep,      fertile, well-drained soil. For bushes, filberts and      hazelnuts have amazingly long and deep roots. They also      have sensitive bark, easily sun-scalded and slow to heal.      Bind the trunks up for winter in burlap to reduce snowglare      injury.    </p>    <p>      Root suckers must be removed every year unless you want a      pincushion on your hands. For best yields, allow only three      or four main trunks to develop. If you want to increase      your filbert population, leaving propagation to the      nut-burying squirrels won't suffice, although you'll see      plenty of them around. Instead, let a sucker grow for a      year on the parent plant. The next spring, take a knife and      make a one-inch-long slit in the bark about six inches from      the tip of the sucker. Then arch the sucker so the tip      touches the ground. Stake it down so it can't pull itself      loose, Bury the cut part of the sucker, from which roots      will sprout. Use good compost, and leave the actual tip of      the sucker exposed to grow as the plant. Water it well.      Early in the second year cut the new plant free and      transplant to a permanent location. You have just "layered"      your first plant. Most willowy bushes and trees can be      propagated in the same way.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HICKORY</strong></p><p>      There are several varieties here, and they're all cousins      of the pecan. Treat the tree as you would a beechnut or a      pecan. It's got a bear of a taproot, three to five feet      long even on a young transplant, so be prepared to dig      halfway to China when setting it in. Give it the best soil      and compost possible, but no manure. It needs no pruning      except to have the top cut back by 25 percent on planting.    </p>    <p>      If you hope to get good eating hickory nuts and not just a      beautiful tree, get the shagbark variety. And if you can't      get hickory stock - as is often the case because it makes a      difficult and chancy transplant-find a supply of      fresh-fallen nuts on your next outing in hickory country,      and plant those. Plant plenty, for few will survive,      <em><strong>but plant!</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>PECAN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most of the above nut trees prefer the northern half of the      country. Pecans are their southern counterpart and usually      grow where cotton will. They need a long, hot growing      season in order to yield.    </p>    <p>      Like all trees, pecans need deep soil, rich and well      drained. And they have the deep taproot as well, which      means you'll be digging again. Try five feet. Taproots on      all trees must be buried absolutely vertical all the way.      Don't try to rattail the tip into a curve or U-shape-you'd      be better off saving yourself the time and trouble and      throwing the tree away.    </p>    <p>      Cut back about 40 percent on planting. Fertilize well and      protect the trunk from sun-scald. Very little pruning is      necessary once the tree is growing, although usually the      lower limbs are removed.    </p>    <p><strong>WALNUT</strong></p>    <p>      Grow black walnut trees for their beauty. Grow Carpathians      for nuts. This hardy tree comes from the mountains of the      same name and is thus very cold-resistant. It is also      readily available through most nurseries ... by popular      demand. It's noted for its large yield of highquality      thin-shelled nuts.    </p>    <p>      Walnuts need deep, well-drained, rich soil, of course, but      a little acidity doesn't hurt. Plant as you do other trees.      Protect the bark from sunscald the first years. Black      walnuts mature fully in a hundred and fifty years. But      don't give up ... the Carpathians wil I bear six to eight      years after planting.    </p>		<hr />    <h3>      fowl    </h3>		<hr />    <p>      <em><strong>Man comes and tills the field and lies      beneath,<br /></strong></em> <strong><em>And after many a      summer dies the swan</em></strong> <em><br /></em>      <strong>-ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</strong>    </p>    <p>      Chickens aren't the only useful domestic fowl on the farm.      Ducks and geese give you variety in meat and eggs, as well      as the highest quality down. And swans, though not a      productive addition, personify beauty itself.    </p>    <p>    <strong>DUCKS</strong></p>    <p>      Among the hardiest and easiest to raise of all fowl are      ducks. For the most part, they are kept for their meat,      though there are duck-egg connoisseurs, and the down and      feathers make fine pillows. Should you have a pond on your      place, the decorative breeds of duck are a pleasant      addition. They also help cut down the algae, which does not      aid fish growth the way plankton does.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BREEDS</strong></p>    <p>      For meat you'll want the Pekin, an all-white duck with a      yellow beak. Black or partially black beaks are sometimes      seen, but a black-billed duck is considered inferior stock.    </p>    <p>      While Pekins will lay quite well, if you really want an      eggproducer, the Indian Runner is your breed. Coloration      ranges from white to white and fawn to pencilled. Since      these ducks grow to only half the size of Pekins, the roast      duck will be a small one. On the other hand, they not only      lay more eggs, but ones of better quality. An Indian Runner      will give you almost as many eggs a year as a lazy chicken.      Duck eggs are excellent for baking, if a little tough fried      or boiled.    </p>    <p>      Show breeds available in the United States include the      Call, Black East India, and Crested White. The first-named,      in addition to being nice on your pond, attracts wild      mallards.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE YARD</strong><br />      <br />      Ducks do not need a pond, despite the fact that they look      more at home there. For meat- and egg-producers, a yard      equipped with a shallow cement or steel basin full of water      suffices. It should be just deep enough for the birds to      wade, wallow, and wash their feathers in. Such a man-made      pool is best supplied with continuously flowing fresh      water.    </p>    <p>      Sandy soil is best, but not absolutely necessary, for the      duck yard. What is necessary is that the soil drain very      well. To this end, duck yards are usually located on      sloping land. Ducks are quite sloppy and noisy fowl, so      don't crowd them. Commercial breeding farms run the birds      at five to eight thousand an acre, but this creates immense      sanitation problems. Twentyfive to a hundred ducks is      plenty for the average farm. That number can be kept      comfortable and clean in a 150-by-300- foot yard.    </p>    <p>      Show ducks on your pond should not be allowed to grow to a      flock of more than ten or twenty. If they do, they will      trample the banks, destroy your watercress, and generally      make a nuisance of themselves. Besides, they'll be      competing with the pond fish for nutrients. A few ducks, on      the other hand, will give good balance to the pond and      increase some of the nutrients.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOUSING</strong><br />      <br />      Housing for ducks is about the same as that for chickens      ... minus roosts, which they don't use. The two cannot be      kept together, however. Mature ducks are cold-hardier than      chickens, so their building doesn't have to be as tightly      constructed. On the other hand, with warmer quarters than      they need, they will develop less protective fat and      consume less food, both of which are to your advantage.      Provide the house with simple nests set about four to six      inches off the floor and comfortably bedded.<br />    </p>    <p>      The house for young ducklings must have all the litter      changed frequently, preferably every two or three days.      Because of their drinking habits, ducks throw around a lot      of water. Even adding a fresh layer of litter every day, as      you must, does not suffice to keep it dry. And wet litter      makes for dead or blind ducks: ammonia from the droppings      gets in their eyes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE FLOCK</strong></p>    <p>      Your first time around, buying day-old ducklings is your      best bet, particularly if you have already raised a flock      of chickens. Brooding and rearing for both are pretty much      the same, and you can use the same kind of equipment.    </p>    <p>      For a duck brood, the room temperature the first week      should be 70 0 F. and the temperature under the hover 90 0      F. Reduce the latter slowly to 80 0 F to 85 0 F. the second      week, and 75 0 to 80 0 F. the third. The fourth through      sixth weeks a 70 0 to 75 0 F. temperature is fine.    </p>    <p>      The same encircling guard system as for baby chicks is used      to prevent crowding and to keep young ducklings close to      the hover. Total brooder area for a hundred ducklings      should be around twenty-five square feet for the first two      or three days and expanded gradually to one hundred and      fifty to two hundred square feet.    </p>    <p>      If the weather is warm and sunny, the ducklings can have an      outside run for a few hours a day as soon as they are three      weeks old. But don't let ducks younger than six weeks near      the pond, or try to give them water to swim in. They'll get      a chill. They are sensitive to not only moist cold, but sun      as well. So when they're permitted to go outside, some      shade must be provided.    </p>    <p>      The feed mix for a duck brood is similar to that for      chicks. For the first week, feed wet mash from a shallow      trough six times a day. Give the ducklings as much as      they'll eat; then remove the trough till the next feeding.      Grit or sand must always be available. Each feeding should      be accompanied by fresh water in a fountain deep enough so      the ducks can submerge their bills fully. They need to      clean their nostrils of caked mash as well as to drink. Be      sure the drinking fountain is not so designed that they can      get their whole body wet, however. They'd love to, but even      indoors chances are they'd catch a bad chill. The second      through eighth weeks, the young ducks should be given a      growing ration fed three times daily. Keep the water      fountains clean and filled.    </p>    <p>      When they are six weeks old the brooder can be removed from      the house and the ducks allowed to range. At ten weeks      they'll weigh in at six pounds or so and are ready for the      roaster. This is the prime time for tender ducks, although      they are still very tasty if slaughtered a few months      later. Ducks are dressed the same way as chickens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BREEDING</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      In some ways it's easiest to buy day-old ducklings every      year for a new flock. But you may want to keep a breeding      flock of your own. If you do, reserve the best of your      ducks for breeding stock. Select those with bills, feet,      and shanks colored an even, heavy yellow. Look for a solid,      compact body, with broad, full breast and short neck. The      plumage should be glossy and full, the eyes round, big, and      bright. You'll need one drake for every five or six ducks.    </p>    <p>      Keep a breeding flock separate from the laying flock if you      don't gather eggs twice a day. Eggs for hatching should be      fresh.    </p>    <p>      Ducks make poor mothers. So when one of your chicken hens      gets broody, let her stay that way instead of trying to      break her of it. Confine your ducks one night and the next      morning gather as many newly laid duck eggs as you can. If      you don't collect enough that day for the size brood you      want, you can store the eggs in a cool, damp place ... no      longer than five days, though. And make sure you turn them      twice a day. If not, the old wives' tale goes, the duck      will stick to the shell. True or not, fewer eggs will hatch      if you don't turn them.    </p>    <p>      Slip a batch of duck eggs under a setting hen slowly.      Remember, a broody hen thinks you're out to swipe her eggs      ... even if she's sitting on an empty nest. She'll be      temperamental and prone to peck. You can allot up to ten      duck eggs per broody hen. They should hatch in twenty-eight      days, unless you have Muscovy ducks, whose eggs take      thirty-four.    </p>    <p>      A mother hen will leave the nest once a day to eat, for      perhaps half an hour. If you're lucky enough to find her      away from her post, take the opportunity to sprinkle the      duck eggs lightly with warm water, particularly toward the      end of the hatching period. Duck eggs, as might be      suspected, need more moisture than their land-fowl      counterparts. Also be sure to turn the eggs once a day. A      chicken will do it herself with her own eggs, but the duck      eggs will be a little too big for her to handle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BROOD</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Once the eggs hatch, the mother hen should be confined to a      floorless cage three by three feet in floor area raised      high enough so the young ducklings can crawl under the      bottom to roam farther when they want. Hens like to walk,      ducks are not as adept at it. By confining the hen, she      will not exhaust the ducklings.    </p>    <p>      Newly hatched ducks do not need to be given food or water      the first twenty-four hours. After that, the care and      feeding schedule is the same as for your first shipment of      day-old ducklings.    </p>    <p>      When the ducks reach the four-week age, the mother hen may      be released from her confinement to guide her ersatz brood      wherever she wants. At six or seven weeks the young ducks      are ready to swim. If your ducklings have been raised by a      chicken hen, incidentally, be prepared to see her throw a      violent fit when the ducks take to the water instead of to      the roosts. It may be a few days before she gives up on her      rebel swimmers and calms down.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GEESE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Geese are even easier to keep than ducks, for during the      green season they can subsist primarily on pasturage. Their      range, however, should be separate from that for other      livestock, since they are rather sloppy about their      hygiene. Also, don't let them pasture in the orchard if you      have young trees. They will destroy the bark. On the other      hand, they are excellent for weeding strawberry patches;      the stupid things much prefer weeds to luscious sun-ripened      strawberries. Geese are such weed fiends they've been used      for many decades now in "goosing down" cotton, or keeping      the fields clean, down Dixie way.    </p>    <p>      Geese are hardy creatures, and the only shelter they will      need is a small house, insulated in the coldest areas, with      an open entrance and a floor to keep out the dampness. In      the South you really don't need to shelter them at all      except to provide shade, either artifical or natural. As an      extra plus, the much-neglected goose is very disease- and      parasite-resistant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BREEDS</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      The geese available in the United States are Toulouse,      Embden, African, Chinese, Pilgrim, Sebastopol, Canadian,      and Egyptian. The first four are the most common in the      United States, and the apprentice farmer should limit his      choice to the Toulouse or the Embden. All the others are      much smaller, except for the African, and that one is very      noisy. The honking might be appealing in the beginning, but      you'd soon have more than enough of it. If the Pilgrim is      available in your region (which it isn't often), some      thought may be given to keeping this breed. Although it      matures to little more than half the size of a Toulouse,      the male and female have different-colored plumage, which      is handy when you're just starting out to breed since it      prevents you from accidentally slaughtering the only gander      in your flock.    </p>    <p>      A mature Toulouse weighs between twenty and twenty-five      pounds. It is a gray goose with white abdomen sweeping up      to the tail. The female will lay an average of twenty-five      eggs a year over a period of about a month. However, she      can't set on that many. Fifteen will be plenty for the      goose. Farm out the rest at the rate of five per broody      chicken hen. The number of eggs per hen should not exceed      five ... you'll see why after checking out the egg size. In      fact, a hen is unable to turn the egg, which is necessary,      so you'll have to do it for her once a day. Start the      chickens setting first, before the goose. In other words,      set the first five eggs laid under a hen, the second five      under another hen. Then let the goose set on whatever else      she lays. Incubation time is about thirty days. When the      goose's eggs are hatched, slip the hen-hatched goslings      into the nest at night to ensure adoption. Make sure she's      taken them in before you leave them on their own. If she      hasn't, you'll have to give them back to the hen.    </p>    <p>      Embden geese are smaller than Toulouse, averaging fifteen      to twenty pounds. They are pure white, and thus more      popular when feathers are wanted. Although their egg      production is lower than that of the Toulouse (about      fifteen eggs per goose per year), they will usually do      their own setting and they make good mothers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TENDING THE FLOCK<br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Geese mate in the fall. One gander will oblige up to four      geese, and if you're planning on roasters, bigamy is the      best course. Often, however, a gander selects a mate for      life. Don't break up the happy couple. But do keep them      away from other ganders during the mating season or some      nasty fights will ensue.    </p>    <p>      As to fights, ganders are naturally pugnacious and,      particularly during the rearing season, will often attack      anything that approaches a nest. This trait is an excellent      reason for selecting Embdens, since with Embdens you won't      have to pick up all those extra eggs that may well be      guarded by the gander long after the goose has given up on      the whole affair. You might think of gander s as only      birds, but a couple of good-sized ones can send you to the      hospital for a week if they really put their minds to it.      Use caution ... or stick to ducks.    </p>    <p>      If you're using a chicken hen to set on Toulouse eggs, she      may need watching. The eggs are apt to hatch unevenly, and      the hen will stroll off with the first thing that moves,      leaving the remaining eggs to rot. So take each gosling      from the nest as soon as it's born. If its mother rejects      it, or hasn't hatched her batch yet, keep the new gosling      in a flannel-lined box located in a warm corner. Keep the      box clean and dry.    </p>    <p>      Once the hen has hatched her five, if the goose rejects the      lot, use the same hen-confinement method as with ducks. At      three to four weeks, as long as they are fully feathered      out, the young goslings may be allowed to swim. Up to this      time, however, they must not be allowed to get wet. Don't      let them out on the grass until the dew is well burned off      for the day. A moist chill is often fatal to bare goslings.    </p>    <p>      Goslings are raised like ducks, except that they must have      fresh greens at all times. Provide plenty of fresh fountain      water in constant supply and feed four times a day, as much      as they'll take. Chopped, hard-boiled eggs, stale bread      soaked in milk just enough to get it moist, and chopped      alfalfa, clover, or vegetables with a teaspoon of cod liver      oil make a good mix for the first week. The second and      third weeks the feed should be a wet mash of cornmeal and      chicken growing mash in addition to pasturage. After that      the geese can be allowed to fend for themselves on the      range.    </p>    <p>      An acre will carry ten geese. They are destructive to      pasture, grazing close to the ground, so rotation is      essential. It's recommended that they be given a daily      supplemental feeding. A good feed is half cornmeal and half      wheat bran or oats, with another 10 percent meat scraps or      middlings (wheat germ). Soaking the meal in buttermilk or      sour milk to make wet mash is excellent. Water, oyster      shells or limestone, and grit should all be available on a      demand basis.    </p>    <p>      In winter increase the grain supplement for geese to 20      percent of their diet and give them legume hay or silage      for the rest. They must have roughage. Fresh vegetable tops      and parings should be given when available to your geese in      preference to your pigs or other farm animals.    </p>    <p>      Before slaughtering a holiday-dinner goose, put it on a      moist-mash, fattening ration of yellow cornmeal and oats      for a couple of months. Mix equal proportions of each with      buttermilk or skim milk to make the mash wet and extra      fattening. The wet mash should constitute about 50 to 75      percent of the goose's diet, with the rest pasturage or      other green fodder. However, don't switch a goose to a      fattening diet overnight or it might develop digestive      problems. Switch gradually, over a week, particularly if      your geese have been almost exclusively on pasture. In      Europe geese are often force-fed to make them extra plump      and expand the liver. This practice isn't worth it unless      you're a glutton for punishment. Goose eggs, incidentally,      make excellent rubber sink stoppers when fried. You're      better off hatching them or selling them to someone else      who wants to raise geese.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SWANS</strong></p><p>      If you have a fair-sized pond, a pair of swans, the most      graceful of all waterfowl, may well be worth keeping.      You'll get neither meat nor eggs from them, but they take      next to no care and are esthetically one of the most      beautiful of all avians.    </p>    <p>      Swans mate for life. So buy a pair if you can. Then step      back. Mate swans are nothing if not ill-tempered.      Eventually they will get to know you and come regularly for      feeding to supplement their diet of water plants and      insects. Even then, it is advised, however, that you make      yourself scarce during mating time. The swans will put      together a large nest of scraps and twigs. Six to eight      greenish-white eggs will be laid and the male will stand      guard over them. He is now ready to attack ... anything      from a cat to an elephant or tractor that approaches the      nest. With luck, you'll have some young swans in six weeks.      But don't be too disappointed if they die young. Swans      often live to sixty years of age ... provided they survive      their first season.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TURKEYS</strong></p><p>      There's only one sane word of advice to the beginner on the      subject of turkeys. Don't raise them. They are incredibly      stupid birds. So much so in fact that if not patiently      taught to eat, they won't know how and will starve to death      ... although once they get the habit, you can't stop them.      They won't even learn to drink unless you keep some marbles      in the water fountain to give them something interesting to      peck at. They are also disease-prone, and have to be      brought in out of the rain or they'll catch their death of      cold ... an exasperating bit of farm routine for the      apprentice during the rainy season. A turkey egg omelet      <em>can</em> be beat ... easily. And so can the      Thanksgiving turkey dinner. I'm all for tradition. But a      modern prepackaged turkey bears no resemblance to the      flavorsome fowl of Pilgrim times. Consider the alternative      ... a plump roast goose.    </p>
