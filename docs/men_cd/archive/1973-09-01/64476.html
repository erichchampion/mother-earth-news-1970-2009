                    <h5 id="byline">      by JACK AND ANNE PARTUSCH    </h5>        <p>      It's about time we shared with MOTHER's family a handy      trick we've learned: the easiest way to shorten tall glass      containers into drinking tumblers. We've used this method      ourselves hundreds of times-even on square Jim Beam      bottles-and we know it works.    </p>    <p>      Here's what you'll need (apart from the bottle): [1] a      foot-long piece of 5/8-inch steel rod, [ 2] a small      quantity of unused motor oil (I use the cheap standard      weight), [3] a pair of pliers and [4] a heat source.    </p>    <p>      First fill the bottle with oil to an eighth of an inch      below the level at which you want it to break (the liquid      will rise slightly when you insert the rod). Before you      attempt to cut the glass be sure that the fluid has settled      and that none is clinging to the sides of the container      above the planned line of cleavage. The colder the bottle      and its contents are, the better ... I like to fill my      future tumblers, leave them outside on a chilly night and      finish the job in the morning.    </p>    <p>      When you're ready to operate, grasp the steel rod in the      pliers and heat the first three inches or so to a tomato      red. Then lower the hot end through the bottleneck a couple      of inches into the oil and hold the metal steady for at      least half a minute. Most glass will snap off with a clean      break in about that time. We do, however, find that for      some reason the thin throwaway containers occasionally      won't cut. If your first attempt doesn't work, it's best to      try another type of bottle.    </p>    <p>      When the neck has dropped off don't grab-or even      touch-the lower part of the container ... it's full      of scalding liquid and will burn your hands. Once the oil      is cool, pour it off and store it for future use. Wash your      new drinking glass with hot water and finish it by      polishing the cut edge with an emery cloth or auto      sandpaper.    </p>    <p>      Prosit!    </p>
