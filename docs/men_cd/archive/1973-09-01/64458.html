            			<p> <strong>Even on a      modest income, you can have a house of your own ... this      article proves it.</strong></p>   		<h5 id="byline">by JOHN O. McMEEKIN</h5>		<hr />     <p>      <em>This article, which appeared in the May 1950</em>      Coronet, <em>is copyright</em> © by Esquire <em>lnc.      and is reprinted with permission.</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Thirteen years ago, a <em>Coronet</em> article changed my      life!    </p>    <p>      Thirteen years ago, my wife and I were hard-up, rent-paying      tenants in a crowded city. Today we are independent and      secure in the Pennsylvania countryside. We own, debt-free,      a $15,000 home. And we did it all on a modest income.    </p>    <p>      How can I credit this independence and security to a      <em>Coronet</em> article? It was called "Houses of Earth,"      and the author maintained that anybody could build his own      house. All you did was erect wooden forms on a foundation,      pound in four-inch layers of dirt, and you would have a      rammed earth (or Pasde Terre) wall.    </p>    <p>      Phisé, it developed, was an ancient and honorable      building method, almost forgotten today. As soon as one      form was full of rammed earth, you moved it and rammed      another section, and so on until the wall was complete. As      simple as that. Easy, cheap and permanent, the article      said.    </p>    <p>      And every word was true. Our home is warm in winter, cool      in summer. The foot-thick walls are proof against vermin,      termites and fire, and will stand for centuries. And they      were easy and cheap to erect, just as the <em>Coronet</em>      article stated. I know, because I have built our      home-during my spare time!    </p>    <p>      There is nothing remarkable about me. I am just an average      fellow: a salesman, 37 years old, weighing 163 pounds. I am      five-feet-eleven, and have the usual number of hands and      legs. It just happens that I used my spare time to build a      home of rammed earth.    </p>    <p>      Our house does not appear unusual. Without knowing its      history, you would drive by and notice only an attractive      home with clean, simple lines. It is big, but it hugs the      ground with an air of belonging. And it is filled with      modern appliances that we were able to afford because we      saved so much by using the construction methods we did.    </p>    <p>      And if we built a home that way, you can too. Here's how we      happened to get started ....    </p>    <p>      Betty read the Coronet article first "Look," she exclaimed,      "the author says that anyone can build a home of rammed      earth."    </p>    <p>      "Not me, honey," I replied. "The only thing I ever built      was a birdhouse, and the Scoutmaster said the comers      weren't square."    </p>    <p>      But Betty was insistent, so we read the article again and      then went to the library for more information. It still      sounded simple. Centuries-old houses made of rammed earth      were still standing, in good repair. The only objection, we      found, was that the method took more time and labor than      conventional techniques.    </p>    <p>      "But look, darling," I said, "suppose we do try      it-you'll suffer hardships. Here in this apartment,      at least we have a bathroom and running water."    </p>    <p>      "And if we stay here, that's all well ever have," she      countered. "Building a place of our own will give us      security and independence-and a place to raise a      family.    </p>    <p>      Betty was right. Our budget proved it. After rent, food and      clothing, there was little left. If our rent money could be      used to buy some land, and my spare time to build on it,      well ....    </p>    <p>      I jotted down a list of requirements for the land: [1] It      had to be cheap; [2] it had to be within commuting distance      of my job; [3] it would be fine if it included a cheap,      run-down house, where we could live while building; [4] it      had to have the right kind of dirt for building with rammed      earth.    </p>    <p>      Fruitlessly we scanned newspaper ads; vainly we haunted      real estate brokers. Finally we got a break on one of our      Sunday afternoon drives into the country. Rounding a bend,      we saw, half-hidden in briars, a weatherbeaten sign: FOR      SALE.    </p>    <p>      A hundred feet from the road stood a decrepit shack. The      walls leaned; newspapers were stuck around the windows. We      made our way to the door.    </p>    <p>      "Nice place here. We see you've got it up for sale."    </p>    <p>      "Yup. Built it myself," the old man replied. "Needs a      little patching, though."    </p>    <p>      "Is the ground good for farming?" I asked.    </p>    <p>      "Raises fine blackberries, but it's too sandy for corn."    </p>    <p>      My spine tingled. <em>Seventy-five per cent sand was ideal      for rammed-earth construction!</em> Exactly what we wanted:      five acres, a run-down house, electricity and water      available, and within driving distance of my job. Anxiously      we asked the price. Wonderful! We could afford it!    </p>    <p>      Next day we drove out and made a down payment of $100 on      our home. Then we arranged mortgage payments the same as      our rent, and two months later were ready to move.    </p>    <p>      Moving day was a bright June morning. I unloaded the truck      as Betty busied herself with cleaning. When night came, we      assembled our bed in what we laughingly called the bedroom.      We fell asleep under our own roof-leaky, maybe, but      our very own! ...    </p>    <p>      For the next few weeks, we were busy making our little      place bright, cheerful and weather-tight. Finally we knew      it would weather the winter. Now we could start building!    </p>    <p>      Already on graph paper were scale drawings of our new home.      Simple in design, it would be a low, one-story structure      with a center section and two wings, in the form of the      letter "U". We would build the center section and one wing      first, move into it, then tear down the old house and      construct the other wing where it stood. Our back wall      called for a picture window and French doors facing the      view, and since they were both large openings we started      there.    </p>    <p>      First came the foundation, a 36-inch reinforced concrete      footing. Narrow in the middle, it tapered out to 12 inches      at the top, the width of our walls. It extends below ground      two feet, the frost level in our area.    </p>    <p>      Excellent plans for building foundation forms are contained      in a free bulletin, No. 277, <em>Rammed Earth Walls for      Farm Buildings</em> , published by the South Dakota State      College at Brookings. Not having enough money to buy new      wood and cement too, I used scrap boards from our corncrib      and lined the forms with waterproof building paper. I found      the only precaution necessary was to be sure the top of the      form was level and that the boards couldn't warp or bulge      under pressure from wet concrete.    </p>    <p>      After I had filled the first section of wall with rammed      earth, I took off the form and it stood there, a beautiful      monolithic block of sandstone eight feet long and seven      feet high, constructed by pressure as it is in nature.    </p>    <p>      "Why, anybody can do that!" commented a friend as he      watched me build a section.    </p>    <p>      He was right. My forms are made from 5/8-inch plywood      shoots, lined with galvanized iron and reinforced at the      edges with angle iron. They are attached on the wall with      bolts threaded on both ends. After the forms are tightened      and made plumb, they are rammed full of earth, each      four-inch layer pounded solid before the next is added.      Then the bolts are removed and the form is ready for the      next section. By using two-by-twelve planks for window and      door frames, it is simple to leave openings in the wall.    </p>    <p>      I built the forms following directions in that South Dakota      bulletin. The materials cost about $50.00, and the forms      are still good as new.    </p>    <p>      When people first discover you are building of rammed      earth, they are incredulous. What holds it down? What makes      it stick together? If it's so good, why doesn't everyone      build of rammed earth?    </p>    <p>      The last question is a good one. The answer is: in this      age, the cost of labor would make rammed-earth construction      fantastically expensive. But for the fellow who will work      for himself, it is ideal. All you need is spare time.    </p>    <p>      I used two tampers. The first, about eight inches square on      the bottom, firms the ground. The other, which a machinist      friend made for me, does the real work. It is a piece of      iron, 4 X 3 X 2-1/2 inches, with a hole bored on the narrow      side. The hole is threaded to fit a one-inch pipe, six feet      long, which forms the handle. The whole thing weighs about      12 pounds.    </p>    <p>      That first winter was rugged. Snowdrifts piled around our      home for months. We would awake to find our water pump      frozen, and Betty would melt snow for our coffee. If I      remarked that we didn't have city conveniences, she would      retort: "It's <em>our</em> home, isn't it?"    </p>    <p>      Winter finally yielded to a cold, damp spring. Fretting at      delay, we waited for the summer sun to dry our dirt. Then      the wall-making went on-weekends, holidays,      vacations, and those golden hours between dinner and      bedtime. There is a jubilant joy in creating something      permanent. So much of what we do in this modern age is      transitory and intangible. But as you give the final      ringing stroke to a rammed-earth wall, you know it will      last 100 years. That gives you a good feeling, down deep      inside.    </p>    		<p>      Meanwhile, you will give up some of your city friends. But      new friends will appear, pioneers like yourself. They won't      come around often, because they are busy with their own      projects, but in case of sickness or need, they are always      ready to help.    </p>    <p>      By fall, our building began to look like a house. On top of      the wall were 2 X 12-inch planks, hold in place by bolts      imbedded in the Pisé. Tarpaper capped them for      protection against weather.    </p>    <p>      Again the winter's sleet and snow beat against our      rammed-earth walls, and again, to the amazement of      skeptical neighbors, they showed little abuse. By the time      we put on a roof, the walls had been thoroughly exposed,      yet they were only slightly roughened, providing an easier      surface for plastering.    </p>    <p>      There is a variety of exterior finishes for rammed earth.      We applied two coats of regular cement stucco plaster,      troweling the second coat smooth. The house is painted      green now, and ivy is climbing the walls. It is      big-78 feet long, and our living-dining room is 24 by      30-but it blends with the landscape so well that few      people realize its size.    </p>    <p>      When we were ready for the roof, there was a war on. Lumber      was scarce and expensive. After we looked for weeks, a      nearby farmer decided to tear down his barn and sell the      timbers. They were handhewn, strong enough to support twice      the weight we required.    </p>    <p>      Then I started learning about hip rafters, valley rafters,      jack rafters and just plain ordinary rafters. There are      plenty of books on how to cope with rafters, but I      developed my own system.    </p>    <p>      First I propped up the ridgepole. Then, with a steel tape,      I carefully measured the distance between it and the wall.      That <em>had</em> to be the length of the rafter, with no      geometric shenanigans. Then I put up a string where the      rafter would be and placed my square against it, both at      top and bottom.    </p>    <p>      By holding the square against the rafter plank, with the      numbers in the same position as when they were against the      string, I would mark the rafter and saw it accordingly.      That had to be the correct angle for the top and bottom      cuts.    </p>    <p>      The war also caused a shortage of lots of other things, so      I haunted house-wrecking places. I found all sorts of      interesting materials-plumbing fixtures for a      fraction of the original price, and doors practically for      the taking. But what made me happiest was the secondhand      lumber, salvaged from scrapped homes-wonderful roof      sheathing that is hard to buy today for any money.    </p>    <p>      Roofmaking is reward ing work, for each rafter changes the      world's skyline, and everyone can see what you have      accomplished. It was two years before the last shingle was      laid one nippy fall day. Now we were ready to work      <em>inside</em> the house.    </p>    <p>      Building a chimney was first. (As a guidebook I used the      excellent Department of Agriculture Bulletin, No. 1889,      <em>Fireplaces and Chimneys.</em> ) Plastering came next.      Then carpentry, wiring and plumbing followed in routine      order.    </p>    <p>      I did them all, using information from free government      pamphlets. None of these trades presents insoluble problems      to a person who can read and follow directions. The chief      difference is that a professional works faster than an      amateur.    </p>    <p>      During the past few weeks, I've been out of a job. So what?      I own my home, have no debts, and can afford to wait until      the right thing comes along. And while I'm on "vacation," I      can put in my time by adding refinements and increasing the      value of our home.    </p>    <p>      If I had not read that <em>Coronet</em> article in 1937, I      shudder to think of my life today-out of work, with      nothing but a stock of worthless rent receipts or perhaps      installments on a mortgage to meet. There would never be      this happy household where I sit on the sunlit terrace and      watch two healthy children playing on our broad acres.    </p>    <p>      Rammed earth promises anyone health, independence and      security. The instructions for building are readily      available, either in government pamphlets or at your public      library. And all the time you invest is your own.    </p>    <p>      If I did it, you can too. So why not follow in my footsteps      and find out what it means to live a fuller, richer and      happier family life?    </p>
