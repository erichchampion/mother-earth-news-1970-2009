                <p>      <strong>SUE GROSS:</strong>    </p>            <p>      My husband and I have just read the goat chapter from      <em>Grow It!</em> in MOTHER NO. 22 and feel that we must      throw in a few remarks for the consideration of other      readers.    </p>    <p>      It would have been helpful to know where Richard Langer got      his information, and how long he's raised goats personally.      So much of what he says just doesn't check with my own five      years' worth of intensive and sometimes tragic experience      ... five years during which we've owned and boarded enough      different goats to have handled a fair cross section of the      breeds and the problems one is likely to run into.    </p>    <p>      It seems sad for MOTHER to be publishing advice that      doesn't agree with real practice or natural methods. As an      alternative, we'd like to suggest that novices can avoid      many problems by trusting nature.    </p>    <p>      Here, first of all, are a couple of the points with which      we disagree:    </p>    <p>      [1] Langer's suggestions on housing and equipment for dairy      goats-as well as on their purchase-are swell if      you have that kind of money. I never have and never will.      It's far better, anyhow, to provide the minimum shelter      necessary in your climate. Here in California we have no      barn at all but merely a roofed shade where the creatures      are healthy and happy. Being tied to a wall in a shed would      be slow death to my animals!    </p>    <p>      Milking equipment can be equally simple: a blue earthenware      pot, mesh strainer and fiber milk filters. Any tight glass      jars will do for containers, and-unless you feel that      you must go in for super-caution-you can forget all      that jazz about ice and sterilization. Your dairy should be      clean, yes ... because that is natural.    </p>    <p>      [21 Grow It! is also way off base in its advice on grain      feeding. Four to eight pounds a day would kill a goat,      lactating or not ... those figures must be a misprint. If      top-quality alfalfa is fed on a free-choice basis and the      proper mineral salt mixture is always available, there's no      real need for any grain except perhaps in very cold      weather.    </p>    <p>      Purina recommends one pound of Goat Chow for each three      pounds of milk given by a doe, and one pound minimum daily      for dry goats and kids. This is really way too much ...      such a heavy ration will make the animals too fat and lazy,      reduce milk output in some cases and cause loose bowels in      others.    </p>    <p>      Next, I'd like to tell my own "goat story" to show why I      feel as I do about natural methods of husbandry.    </p>    <p>      We had a fine scrub Nubian doe that gave three quarts of      milk a day. She was our first, and we loved her dearly. I      did everything in my power to follow the advice of      "experts" . tempering their words with some common sense      and what I learned by trial and error. (The animal,      unhappily, was the one that suffered from my learning      process.)    </p>    <p>      Since I have a child who nearly died before we found goat      milk, I have to have a year-round supply ... so I began      looking for a second doe. I'd almost lost hope of finding      anything worth having in my price range when a neighbor      told me about a registered French Alpine, of champion      stock, that was going cheap because her blemishes made her      unshowable. She had just freshened for the second time and      had given birth to triplets. Best of all, she cost only      $35.00. I jumped at the bargain.    </p>    <p>      The papers were all in order and-since the doe looked      beautiful-I bought her. The owners told me that she'd      been attacked by dogs the previous year and that her bag      was no longer perfect: Fluid leaked from tiny holes on the      udder's sides during milking, but not when the animal was      at rest. The bag was well-shaped otherwise, though, and I      felt that I'd managed a "steal".    </p>    <p>      The next morning, however, it was obvious that my new goat      was not well. Her udder was hot and red-swollen but without      much milk. I was frantic ... we had spent every spare dime      to buy the Alpine so there was no reserve with which to pay      a vet. The sale was final, and I was stuck.    </p>    <p>      I had to call my only milk customer and tell her I had no      supply available ... and her family turned out to have the      answer to my trouble. They knew nothing about livestock      but-being interested in everything to do with health      and nutrition-they brought by a book called Vermont      Folk Medicine. The author, Dr. D.C. Jarvis, had set up      practice in a remote part of the Green Mountain State where      he discovered that the old-time residents had a very      profound, natural system for maintaining health, seldom      needed his services and lived to a serene old age. They      were more than willing to share what they knew, and Dr.      Jarvis learned that the main addition to his neighbors'      plain, unprocessed food was raw apple cider vinegar. The      same substance was also used as a veterinary preventive and      remedy.    </p>    <p>      My customers had brought a quart of the vinegar with them      and the taste and smell were so delicious and appetizing      that decided to try Dr. Jarvis' methods on my sick goat.      The treatment was simple: two tablespoons of vinegar to one      pound of dairy grain twice a day ... every day. The idea is      to maintain the chemical balance in the body for prevention      of illness as well as for the cure of specific infection.    </p>    <p>      It worked! By the fifth day our patient was eating      normally, the milk was nearly clear and the rough coat and      dull eyes were gone for good. We started using our new      doe's output on the seventh day and were pleased with the      rich, sweet flavor ... her milk has never tasted "goaty".    </p>    <p>      Darlene (the Alpine) loved the vinegar and didn't want the      grain without it. The other goats started getting the same      dose-you bet!-and total production rose even      though the Nubian was due to dry up. In fact, I had to take      her off grain and vinegar to stop her lactation.    </p>    <p>      Then I made a big mistake. After nine months of terrific      milk production and an easy mating (Darlene had always been      very hard to breed before, since she stayed in heat only      six to eight hours), I dried the Alpine up as I had the      other nanny. Because she was a little too fat I decided to      cut the grain out of her diet ... and in so doing I got      careless about the vinegar.    </p>    <p>      The doe was in blooming good health and looked ready to      have quadruplets. She freshened easily with two delightful      and devilish buck kids-very large and      active-and I was thrilled.    </p>    <p>      At that point the result of my mistake became clear. Within      24 hours Darlene had raving mastitis, and the kids had to      be removed for fear they'd get sick from her milk. I      restarted the vinegar at once, along with every herb and      plant I could offer her. She took comfrey with relish, and      little else ... except the vinegar grain, which she ate      with frantic speed. I mixed more of the acid in warm water      with molasses, and my poor doe drank it in sobbing gulps.    </p>    <p>      That treatment stopped the mastitis cold, without vets or      antibiotics. Darlene was well in three days, the kids were      returned to her and the milk was perfectly normal.    </p>    <p>      My goat will never again pass a day without her dose of      vinegar ... and neither will I. Darlene also gets fresh      tomatoes, comfrey, cornstalks, leaves and a hundred other      fresh, natural foods from the garden. When she bloats a      little from a new bale of hay, I give her an armful of mint      sprigs. It works. I just put all the feed where she can get      it and let her choose.    </p>    <p>      The fresh or dry tops of onions and garlic are a special      treat for the goats ... when the animals aren't in      production (because such food makes their milk taste pretty      bad). I grow stock beets, pumpkins and soybeans just for      the herd, and the does repay me with terrific milk and      large healthy kids that don't need pampering and sterile      conditions to survive.    </p>    <p>      I must add one tragic experience to this story in the hope      that if other goats are saved I'll be repaid in some      measure for the loss of our dearest animal friend. Cocoa,      the Nubian we had first, was found one afternoon in her pen      quite dead. She had choked on her own collar. The band was      fairly snug on her neck and I'll never know how she got her      nose into it too. A freak accident, to be sure, but so      unnecessary! The sole purpose of the collar is to give one      control of the animal when it's outside the pen, and the      small convenience isn't worth the risk.    </p>    <p>      Another sad experience makes me angry that Langer suggests      using a collar to tether a goat. If you must do such a      miserable thing as tie your animal, make or buy a      well-fitted halter such as you would use for a horse or      cow.    </p>    <p>      The incident that makes me say this with such heat      concerned a goat that was brought here to board after a      mishap. That doe had been tied out with collar and chain      practically since birth and was as used to it as an animal      can be . . . yet one day a dog attacked her and she was so      badly frightened that she broke her windpipe when she hit      the end of the tether. She was saved from her enemy, but      she wheezed and gasped pitifully for every breath and her      owners brought her to me in the hope of a cure. None was      possible and she died shortly with her spirit broken as      well as her windpipe. What a waste for want of a fence!    </p>    <p>      To sum it all up, I think it's obvious that the more      natural and loving we can be to ourselves and our animals,      the better off we'll be. Chemicals and manipulation may do      the job, but never better than good ole Ma. I'd be glad of      any feedback-pro or con-on my ideas ... I'm still      learning from the bottom up and have a very long way to go.    </p>
