                        <p>      I just had to answer C.D. Prewitt's remarks on electricity      (MOTHER NO. 21, pg. 86). My major gripe is that some people      may assume that because he's done some foolish things      unharmed, they may do the same and survive.    </p>    <p>      The fact is that each person's bodily resistance to      electricity is different, and even that varies from time to      time. As a rather crude test, we duplicated Mr. Prewitt's      experiment on thirty people working in our plant's assembly      area. Our instrument was an ohmmeter with an internal 1.5V      battery, and the resistance was measured by having a person      hold one of the device's probes in each hand and squeeze      the tips between thumb and forefinger. Here are the      results, expressed as a chart of bodily reactions to      various current levels.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, the hand-to-hand resistance varied over a      surprisingly wide range among our thirty subjects. We made      the check because some of the assemblers were getting mild      shocks from our heat welders (15V). We had thought it was      impossible, but the test shows that-on a hot, humid      day-five or six of these people might indeed feel      discomfort.    </p>    <p>      This is a good reminder, I think, that low voltages may not      be as safe as we often believe, and that 115 volts becomes      very dangerous for some people even under the best      conditions.    </p>    <p>      I believe that any shock is potentially hazardous and that      all electrical circuits should be treated with great care.      What one gets away with in practice is quite misleading. An      entirely safe situation can change in a second to an      extremely hazardous circumstance ... for example, if one      merely brushes against a good ground such as a water pipe.    </p>    <p>      I hope Mr. Prewitt's thoughts haven't killed anyone.    </p>    <p>      Grover Mull<br />      Beaverton, Oregon    </p>    <p>      I'd like to offer some comments on C.D. Prewitt's article      in MOTHER NO. 21 ... but first of all, to get the matter of      practical experience vs. theory out of the way, I should      mention that I'm retired after having spent most of my life      in electricity and electronics. That's something like 46      years working with power. If you add the school years spent      merely in experimenting with it, make that about 50 years.      In addition, I have had many years of college-level      training in this field. Thus I think I can offer a pretty      good combination of practical experience and theory.    </p>    <p>      Now to Mr. Prewitt's remarks: First and most important are      his comments on electrical shock, if only because such      ideas pose a major threat to anyone who takes them      seriously. Electricity <em>is</em> dangerous, and it is      <em>not</em> imagination or fright which causes the hazard!      Shock, as Volta discovered something like 200 years ago,      will cause a violent muscular contraction in a living body      (or even in one newly dead, as with Volta's frog legs). If      this powerful spasm happens in the heart muscle, it can      throw the organ into ventricular fibrillation ... precisely      the condition brought about by a coronary thrombosis. If      someone who knows how to deal with this emergency is not at      hand, the accident is quickly fatal.    </p>    <p>      Passing a current from hand to hand is an excellent way to      send a goodly portion of that power through the heart,      since major blood vessels run from the arms to that organ.      Thus a hand-to-hand contact is the most commonly lethal of      all electrical shocks. Only the head-to-foot (as used in      execution in the electric chair) is more dangerous, because      in that case the current passes through the brain. A person      working with electricity is much more likely to get a      hand-to-hand shock than any other variety. (A current      passing from finger to finger is not particularly dangerous      for the simple reason that the heart or brain is not      included in its circuit.)    </p>    <p>      I'd like to shed some light on Mr. Prewitt's experiences      with batteries which led him to the conclusion that      electricity is less dangerous than is usually thought. You      can get a "shock" of several thousand volts from an      induction coil such as that used on an automobile, and that      jolt will not kill you ... for the very simple reason that      there is no appreciable amount of current available from      the source. It is <em>current</em> that kills. Connect a      human body to a high-tension line carrying as much      <em>voltage</em> as an induction coil yields, and that body      will be burned to a crisp in short order. My father saw      such a happening when the line was carrying only 500 volts      DC. DC, mark you, not AC ... either kind of current can      kill if it passes through the right part of the body.    </p>    <p>      Mr. Prewitt's chain of dry cells would not yield a current      to compare to that from a powerline for the simple reason      that the internal resistance of the batteries is much      higher than the impedance of the transformer feeding a      household load. To put it differently, the voltage of a      chain of dry cells drops appreciably when a load is      connected. That of a powerline- <em>adequately      wired</em> -does not. You can draw up to several      hundred amperes out of a powerline for a few seconds. Mr.      Prewitt's dry cells, on the other hand, would yield perhaps      35 amperes or so on short circuit. Had he been using a      chain of lead-acid storage cells, he would have had quite a      different experience ... since those devices yield a      current of several hundred amperes on short-circuit.    </p>    <p>      About the relative safety of AC and DC: The reason a person      <em>feels</em> more of a shock from alternating than from      direct current is very simple, and is twofold. First, you      get two shocks whenever you connect to a DC source: one      when you connect, a second when you disconnect or when the      power is discontinued. Alternating current (AC) is,      effectively, connected and disconnected twice for each      alternation ... four times for each cycle. Thus a 60 Hz      current such as that from most power mains in the USA will      deliver 240 shocks for each second you are in contact with      the line.    </p>    <p>      Another factor in electrical shock is the <em>peak</em>      voltage and current involved. Although the values commonly      given for alternating current are the rms (root mean      square) or <em>effective</em> values, what you feel is the      <em>peak</em> value: A so-called 110-volt AC line will      deliver 155.551 volts rather than the 110 you might expect.      This figure is the rms value times the square root of 2      (about 1.4141). Multiply that factor by the rms voltage or      current being delivered by an AC line, and you have what      you'll feel as a shock if you connect to that line.    </p>    <p>      Now to Mr. Prewitt's "practical" advice on the use of DC in      preference to AC. Like most such suggestions, his counsel      is "iffy". If you want to use standard appliances such as      washing machines and dryers as well as thermostatically      controlled heating appliances such as waffle irons,      smoothing irons, percolators, etc., your best choice is AC      for the simple reason that motors are more economically      made to operate on alternating current. Thermostatically      controlled heating appliances don't work well on DC because      every time the circuit is broken direct current pulls a      wicked arc, which quickly burns out the rather delicate      points used in a thermostatic switch.    </p>    <p>      If, on the other hand, you are going to use only a light      load such as incandescent lamps-and if the power is      to come from a private plant-then DC is the logical      choice if only because a bank of storage batteries can be      charged from a generator of some kind and used as a      reservoir to carry the load most of the time. For example,      it's practical to charge storage cells from wind-driven      generators and thus have some electricity for the cost of      upkeep only and essentially without contamination of any      kind. A more practical source for most locations, however,      is a gasoline-driven generator which can be started up      whenever the batteries need a boost.    </p>    <p>      If you produce your own power and want to use a full line      of household appliances which will need a substantial part      of your generator's capacity, an alternating current      powerplant is the better choice because it eliminates the      added expense of buying DC motors for your appliances.      Incidentally, some household items use "universal"      brush-type motors which will operate on either AC or DC ...      provided that the DC voltage is equal to the rms or      effective value of the AC voltage the mechanism is designed      for. Often a universal motor will run a little faster on DC      than it will on AC. If this matters, perhaps you will want      to provide some means of controlling the voltage to the      device.    </p>    <p>      Thus Mr. Prewitt's advice to get a DC power source if at      all possible is not necessarily sound. As I said before,      this is an "iffy" question. Each person must apply common      sense to his situation and then make the decision that best      fills his needs. I urge my readers to seek expert advice      before selecting a powerplant for home use. Which is the      better type of current depends on the possible sources and      the uses to which it will be put. No one answer will fit      all circumstances.    </p>    <p>      Let me again remind Mr. Prewitt that I have had upward of      fifty years' experience with electricity ... experience      backed with the theoretical training of an electronic      engineer. I have spent most of my life working with      electricity and I can say with all earnestness that I am      not afraid of it. Still, like fire, electricity is an      excellent servant but a mighty poor master. I respect both      fire and electricity very deeply and would advise others to      do likewise.    </p>    <p>      I would like to suggest to Mr. Prewitt that he buy himself      some textbooks and back his practical experience with the      theory required to make him an authority on the subject.    </p>    <p>      David A.
