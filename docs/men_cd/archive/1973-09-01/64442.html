                    <h5 id="byline">      by KIETH<br />      W.<br />      JOHNSON    </h5>        <p>      Our North Dakota homestead is just ten miles from the      Canadian line and, when we moved "in", there was no house      on the small farm. We needed a residence that would      withstand those long, severe winters when temperatures of      40 below are not uncommon. We also wanted electricity and      indoor plumbing. You can call us chicken for that last      requirement ... but have you ever used an outhouse when you      had to look up to see zero on the thermometer?    </p>    <p>      Anyway, there we were trying to stretch some sort of home      out of a severely limited budget. The situation appeared      impossible. Then, just when we were about to give up      trying, a friend suggested we buy a nearby house that was      for sale and move it to our property.    </p>    <p>      As crazy as the idea seemed, it worked. The five-room, wood      frame, insulated building-complete with storm      windows, screens, cupboards, carpeting in two rooms and      linoleum in the other three, modern wiring, two porches,      curtains and a kitchen sink-cost us only $900. The      moving charges came to $375. Since the house needed no      repair and was complete and ready to live in, we had few of      the expenses associated with building. The ole budget not      only covered the purchase price and transportation charges      ... but the construction of a basement for our "new" home      too!    </p>    <h3>      BARGAIN, MOVABLE HOUSES ARE EVERYWHERE    </h3>    <p>      I'm not saying that ours is the only or always the most      economical way to solve a shelter problem ... but it      certainly worked for us. Even now, I have difficulty      believing we obtained such a fine building for so small an      investment. Of perhaps even more interest (from your point      of view) is the fact that our bargain housing was      definitely no "iffy", one-of-a-kind fluke. Solid, older,      movable homes are available at extremely reasonable cost      all over this continent. Many are priced much lower than      the small amount we paid for ours.    </p>    <p>      Some may even be had for the asking ... or, should I say,      "the moving".    </p>    <h3>      WHERE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR    </h3>    <p>      Once you've had your eyes opened to the possibilities,      you'll probably be as surprised as we were at the number of      abandoned homes in the United States and Canada (especially      in rural areas). Look for the older small farms that have      been consolidated into a single "agribiz" giant ... thereby      making one or more whole sets of houses, barns and      outbuildings superfluous. There are often good buys in      villages ... especially the backwater, sleepy, dying kind.      And don't forget that people often build a new house merely      to have more or less living space, not because the old one      is worn out: when you spot replacement construction, ask      the budder what he intends to do with the older home.    </p>    <h3>      THE GENERAL ECONOMICS OF THE UNDERTAKING    </h3>    <p>      A small, one-story house is the easiest and least expensive      to move. Don't be afraid to look at larger homes, however,      if you desire more room. It's possible to transport just      about any size building from one location to another ...      I've even seen grain elevators going down the road. Just      remember that the larger a structure is, the stronger its      frame and floor joists must be for the building to be moved      safely.    </p>    <p>      I would avoid any house which is not sitting on a good      foundation and I wouldn't even consider a building that      appears to be leaning. If you start with a structure that's      solid and straight, you'll have a lot more dollars left in      your pocket at the end of the move.    </p>    <p>      And don't forget the route over which you intend to      transport your "new" house. That can have a widely varying      impact on your wallet too. The shorter the distance from      the build    </p>    <p>      ing's present site to where you want it, the better. Are      the roads between the two locations adequately wide and      free of overpasses? If not, do you have good alternate      routing in mind?    </p>    <p>      What about low electric and telephone wires (more of a      problem in town than in the country)? Raising a few lines      is an acceptable expense, but hoisting too many will knock      a hole in your budget. Get firm quotations from the proper      utility before you start trucking down the road.    </p>    <h3>      SHOULD YOU DO THE MOVING YOURSELF?    </h3>    <p>      I've seen buildings transported by amateurs with only the      most basic equipment. Once you've found a nice house,      however, and know that you really want to see it arrive on      your homestead intact, I'd recommend the services of a      professional moving crew. These men often travel great      distances (and frequently work their way completely around      a state), so don't be alarmed if-at first-you      have difficulty finding such specialists. The chief of a      transfer crew-of course-will have to inspect      the structure you want moved, the route over which it will      be carried and your home's new location before he can give      you an accurate estimate on the cost of the job.      You-of course-will want to get that estimate in      writing.    </p>    <p>      A professional crew comes complete with large jacks, heavy      timbers, planking, blocking, blocks and tackles, trucks and      experience ... equipment and skill-in other      words-that the amateur can seldom muster for a      one-shot deal.    </p>    <p>      A veteran team of movers can make the transporting of a      building look much simpler than it really is. First they      lift the house off its foundation with heavy jacks ...      very, very carefully and all at once to keep the structure      from being twisted out of shape. Giant timbers are then      slid under the building and the jacks are removed.    </p>    <p>      As soon as suitable blocking and planks can be arranged,      the house is rolled off its old foundation (with small      steel rollers) and onto a truck. Actually, in most cases,      only part of the structure rests on the truck and the      overhanging portions ride on dolly wheels. Occasionally, a      very large building is even cut into two or more pieces and      carried to another location in sections. The raising and      rolling process is then reversed to lower the home onto its      new foundation.    </p>    <p>      This all requires considerable skill and hard work ... and      it took a crew of six two days to move our modest-sized      house a relatively short distance.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if the building you're trying to transport is      small enough, you may be able to improvise and do the job      yourself. I've seen little structures taken from one site      to another with a "drag". The buildings were jacked up, let      down on long runners or poles (the drag) and then slowly      pulled to the desired spots. It's a great, low-cost way to      move a good-sized chunk of anything over sod, dirt or      gravel ... but won't work at all on hard-surfaced roads.    </p>    <p>      Speaking of improvisation, I have a friend who once carried      a three-room cottage to a new location on a haystack mover.      He was pretty clever ... but not nearly as enterprising as      another acquaintance. This second fellow found himself a      two-story house that was a real-I mean real      -bargain ... except for the fact that the route along      which he proposed to move the structure was absolutely      loaded with overhead wires. My friend finally tore off the      building's top story, moved the bottom half and then      rebuilt the second floor. He was able to reuse almost all      the original lumber, so his idea worked out quite well.    </p>    <h3>      AND THE MORAL OF THIS STORY IS...    </h3>    <p>      Buying or accepting the donation of an existing budding and      then taking the structure to where you want it offers all      kinds of low-cost housing possibilities. I hope you'll give      this approach to recycling some thought. Good hunting and      good moving!    </p>
