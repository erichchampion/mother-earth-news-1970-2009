            			<p>			O, it sets my heart a-clickin' like the tickin' of a clock,When      the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.      (James Whitcomb Riley)    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Jack McQuarrie    </h5>    <p>      When most of us think of pumpkins, we tend to limit our      conjuring to visions of spicy pies and eerily glimmering      jack-o'-lanterns. Actually, though, the bright round gourds      have served a number of additional purposes -      gastronomic and otherwise - since . . . well, since      before recorded history.    </p>           <p>      In fact, archaeologists have found the remains of pumpkins      among the relics left by ancient cliff dwellers. And when      Europeans first arrived on these shores, they were quick to      learn - from native Americans - to plant the      distinctive squash between hills of corn . . . discovering      that their sprawling vines served as a living mulch and      helped keep the maize fields free of weeds. The early      settlers apparently developed "orange thumbs" in this      regard, too . . . because Samuel Eliot Morison (an expert      on the period) writes, in his book <em>The Story of the      "Old Colony" of New Plymouth</em> , that the pumpkins      harvested prior to that first Thanksgiving were piled "in      great golden heaps alongside the houses".    </p>    <p>      Of course, back in those days folks were wise enough to      make an effort to get the maximum use out of      <em>everything</em> they had . . . and the lowly pumpkin      was no exception. Some accounts actually report that early      New England barbers - when they couldn't find a cap      or bowl for the purpose - simply hollowed out a small      pumpkin shell and fit it over the hair of a customer as a      make-do shearing guide (hence the expression "pumpkin      head").    </p>    <p>      And, as you'd imagine, pioneer cooks used the vegetables      extensively: They dried the gourds and ground them into      flour . . . they baked or steamed the shells and -      after pressing the cooked pulp through a sieve and adding      sweetening and spices - put up jars of pumpkin butter      . . . and they prepared puddings and soups and wines and      dozens of other dishes from the squash, as well. (In 1672,      author John Josselyn reported in his journal, <em>New      England Rarities Discovered</em> , that <em>stewed</em>      pumpkin makes a nice accompaniment to "fish or flesh" but      observed that the vegetable "provokes urine extremely and      is very windy".)    </p>    <p>      All in all, then, this food is certainly versatile enough      to deserve a more prominent place in the      <em>contemporary</em> North American kitchen. For one      thing, pumpkin ranks among the richest of domestic produce      nutritionally: A half-cup contains only 27 calories . . .      but yields a whopping 2,500 units of vitamin A, and      considerable quantities of B complex and C vitamins, too .      . . along with generous amounts of phosphorus, calcium, and      iron.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly enough, relatively few cooks today realize      that pumpkin can be substituted in virtually any recipe      calling for winter squash. (Botanically speaking, the      pumpkin species - <em>Cucurbita pepo</em> -      includes summer squash, too, but the "symbols of Halloween"      themselves are closer in texture and flavor to, and      therefore more appropriate alternates for, winter      varieties.)    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, because pumpkin tends to take on the      dominant flavors of whatever ingredients it's cooked with,      you can use it as the basis for many different dishes . . .      particularly those that are highly spiced. For example,      next time you crave some banana nut bread and don't have      any of the tropical fruit on hand, remember that "punkin"      can save the day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO PICK A PUMPKIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      I hope I've convinced you to try to increase your use of      this tasty, healthful vegetable, because early fall is the      beginning of the season when fresh pumpkins are abundant (      <em>and</em> inexpensive). If you're growing your own, do      wait till after the first frost . . . then cut the orbs      from their vines, leaving about one inch of stem on each.      But don't bring the harvest inside immediately. Instead,      let the fruit "cure" in the field for two to three weeks      (unless you're hit by an extended rainy spell . . . in      which case you should get the golden globes under cover to      prevent rot).    </p>    <p>      If you're <em>buying</em> a pumpkin, choose a specimen with      a firm skin and stem. The small "sugar" varieties are best      for cooking . . . but just about any size can be used in      most dishes. There's no reason, for example, why you can't      purchase a pumpkin of substantial girth to be carved into a      jack-o'-lantern and then recycled, after Halloween, into a      tasty meal or two.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO PRESERVE A PUMPKIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      It isn't necessary that you eat your entire supply of      pumpkin right away . . . since one of this vegetable's      greatest advantages is its easy preservability. The gourds      don't keep quite as well in a root cellar as do      thickerskinned winter squash . . . but if handled gently so      that they don't bruise, and stored - off the ground      and not touching one another - in a cool (50째 to      60째F) moisture-free location, they should stay fresh      for up to three months. (Do wipe the cellared fruit with a      cloth from time to time, though . . . otherwise, the      moisture resulting from condensation could lead to decay.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, you can also freeze or can pumpkin . . . by      following the instructions in any good cookbook or      food-preservation text. As an alternative, though, you      might want to try a handy traditional southern method for      <em>drying</em> the produce. Just scoop out the insides and      slice the fruit into inchwide rings . . . and then peel the      circles and hang them on a horizontal broom handle or stick      near your stove or - when the weather's good -      outside.    </p>    <p>      If you let the rounds dehydrate until they're tough and      leathery, and then store them in airtight containers (or      simply hang them in a warm, dry place), they'll keep for      quite a long time . . . but if you use this preservation      method, you <em>will</em> have to cook the food at length      - as much as several hours - to restore it to a      palatable consistency.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S ALL-TIME FAVORITE PUMPKIN PIE      RECIPE</strong>    </p>    <p>      We've printed a prodigious number of recipes within the      pages of this magazine over the years, but few have      elicited as much praise from palate-pleased readers as did      the pumpkin pie "receipt" submitted to us by Esther      Shuttleworth, mother of the founder of this publication. We      first revealed Mrs. Shuttleworth's secret in issue 41's      foldout and - in honor of the approaching      Thanksgiving season - reprint it here.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ESTHER SHUTTLEWORTH'S PUMPKREAM PIE</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 cup of granulated sugar (this would be difficult to      substitute for . . . and, after all, it's a holiday!) 1      teaspoon of cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon of      cloves (optional) 1 pinch of salt 2 eggs 1 cup of pumpkin      (canned, or fresh and cooked till thick) 1 cup of thick      sweet whipping cream unbaked pie crust    </p>    <p>      Combine all the dry ingredients, and beat in the two eggs      till the mixture is fluffy. Stir in the pumpkin and then      the whipping cream. When the filling is thoroughly blended,      pour it into an 8" (1-1/4"-deep) pastry-lined piepan, and      bake it at 425째Ffor 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to      375째F, and bake the pie for approximately 30 more      minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the filling      comes out clean. While in the oven, the "pumpkream" will      rise, then fall somewhat and - when it's nearly done      - develop little "good pie" cracks along the edges.      "Most pumpkin pies are too spicy and 'pumpkiny' for my      family," says Mrs. Shuttleworth, "but they love this one!"    </p>    <p>      <strong>PUMPKIN SEEDS</strong>    </p>    <p>      I often wonder how many thousands of pounds of delicious      pumpkin seeds are thrown away each year by folks who are      anxious to scrape out the "gunky stuff" and get to work      carving their jack-o'-lanterns! I hope <em>you</em> won't      be among those unfortunate individuals this season . . .      because it's a simple matter to turn those "worthless"      kernels into a terrific taste treat for the entire family.    </p>    <p>      Simply rinse the nuggets in water to wash away the strands      of pulp, and then - after letting them dry -      scatter about two cupfuls on an oiled cookie sheet or      shallow baking pan. Sprinkle the seeds with a couple of      tablespoons of melted butter or salad oil, and - if      you wish - a teaspoon or so of salt or herbs, and      bake them in a slow (250째F) oven until they're crisp.      (You may want to turn up the heat for the last five minutes      to brown them nicely.)    </p>    <p>      If you like sunflower kernels, you'll probably      <em>love</em> roasted pumpkin (or squash, for that matter)      seeds . . . and incidentally, you can eat them shells and      all. Better yet, besides being downright delectable, the      food makes an exceptionally nutritious high-energy snack:      An ounce of roasted pumpkin seeds yields 160 calories,      eight grams of protein, three milligrams of iron, and      substantial quantities of B vitamins to boot!    </p>    <p>      Strange as it may sound, you can also make a healthful      <em>drink</em> from the nuggets: Combine a cup of pumpkin      seeds and fibers, 3 cups of water or fruit juice, a      tablespoon of honey, and a teaspoon of parsley or mint . .      . and process the mixture in a blender. When the shells are      pulverized, strain the concoction and store the liquid in      the refrigerator until you're thirsty!    </p>    <p>      <strong>AND THAT'S NOT ALL!</strong>    </p>    <p>      In addition to its better-known <em>culinary</em>      characteristics, the pumpkin serves a variety of other      practical purposes. Much of this country's crop is sold for      stock feed . . . and in Europe the seeds are pressed to      produce a much-cherished cooking oil. Some say, too, that      the leaves from a pumpkin plant can provide an effective      fly repellent for cattle when crushed and rubbed on the      animals' backs and necks. And you can even make a nifty      wind instrument from a pumpkin vine: Just choose a sturdy      eight- or ten-inch length of hollow stem and then -      at a point about an inch from one end - carve a      1/4-inch hole and (a few inches farther down) three or four      additional bores spaced about an inch apart. Then play the      gadget as you would a fife!    </p>    <p>      One thing's for sure: No matter what you use your pumpkins      for this year, you'll be joining the ranks of individuals      who - over the decades and centuries and millenniums      - have learned that this humble, easy-to-grow      squash,is a faithful provider . . . and a true friend to      those seeking sustenance and pursuing the path of      self-sufficiency. And that, perhaps, is precisely what      makes the pumpkin great.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you're interested in expanding your      repertoire of delicious pumpkin-based dishes, you'd do well      to latch onto a delightful little cookbook by Erik      Knud-Hansen entitled</em> Pumpkin Happy <em>.
