        (FROM LEFT) This season's pinecone is on the left, last year's worthless specimen is on the right. Foresters can detect old cones at a glance, so it's essential to know the difference. . . . A homemade con-cutter makes testing seeds for viability and maturity much easier. Look for seeds as firm and distinct as those from a purchased packet. . . . The author's wife collects cones in a metal pail. Note her use of a hard hat and gloves.
