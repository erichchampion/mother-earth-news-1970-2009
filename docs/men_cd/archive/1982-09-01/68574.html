                        <h5 id="byline">by        David K. Anderson      </h5>            <p>      <em>Store-bought toys aren't nearly as much fun as the ones      you and your children make together!</em>    </p>        <p>      When your young'uns are housebound on a rainy Saturday      morning and near to bursting with ( <em>mostly</em> )      suppressed youthful energy - or, say, when the      children are invited to a birthday party but there's not      even a bit of extra room in your budget to buy a gift for      them to give - <em>that's</em> the time to put on      your very best Long John Silver-like "aye, me hearties"      accent and call all hands on deck to help build the finest      little cardboard pirate ship ever to sail the Sea of      Imagination.    </p>    <p>      First, keeping in mind the fact that young crew members      tend to have relatively short attention spans, quickly      gather together a few basic supplies - a utility      knife, scissors, white glue, masking tape, and some flat      sheets of cardboard cut from an old carton or two -      then hurry back to your fledgling shipbuilders, before they      begin to plan a mutiny, and establish yourself firmly as      the skipper on this project. (Of course, an adult should      <em>always</em> supervise when youngsters are using      scissors.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMPONENTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      First, obviously, you need to manufacture the      <em>parts</em> for your man-of-wars. The accompanying      illustrations show all the components on a scale of one      square per inch . . . so in order to draw the pieces to      true size, just count the squares along any given dimension      and - using a ruler - pencil the actual      measurement directly onto the cardboard. Or make a      traceable pattern for each component by sketching the parts      to full size on graph paper that's divided into one-inch      blocks ... then cut out and draw around the templates to      transfer the outlines to the corrugated panels.    </p>    <p>      With that task accomplished, you can put your crew to work      snipping out the vessel's various elements. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: Corrugated carton sides are very difficult to cut      with scissors, so you may need to carve out the components      yourself, using a utility knife. If you have young children      who are determined to do more than watch, however, you      might want to score (cut partly through) the outlines      first, then let the youngsters go at the parts with their      scissors. Or you could try constructing the ship from      lighter cardboard (posterboard, the salvaged backs of      drawing tablets, or what have you) to make the job easier      on small fingers . . . although the finished toy will, of      course, be less sturdy.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Make two main body sections and planks, and a pair of each      kind of sail (including the mainmast/mainsail unit). Then      trim out <em>one</em> of each of the remaining components.      Now glue the matching sail pieces, and the two planks, back      to back . . . so that they're double-thick and therefore      double-strong. (Do NOT fasten the body sections together.)    </p>    <p>      Next, cut out a pair of 1/4"-wide, 1"-long strips of      cardboard, and affix one to each end of what will be the      bottom side of the plank (the raised tips will serve as      stops to keep the board from sliding all the way into or      out of the ship). While the adhesive dries, make a one-inch      incision in the mainmast as shown . . . insert the little      saddlelike support piece into the opening, with the tabs      facing down . . . and glue it in place.    </p>    <p>      As you can see from the diagrams, slots must also be cut in      several other parts of the ship - to accommodate      sails and sail supports - and a 1/2"-deep by 1"-wide      notch must be carved out of the port side of the hull to      receive the plank. (All of these jobs require a sharp      knife, and therefore should likely be considered the      <em>skipper's</em> duty.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>ASSEMBLY</strong>    </p>    <p>      At this point you're ready to begin putting your cardboard      craft together. Before you start taping and gluing, though,      consider that you'll want to <em>remove</em> the masking      material once the adhesive has dried sufficiently to hold      the pieces fast . . . so it's best to avoid gluing over the      paper tape. And, since you'll be applying paste mostly to      the <em>inside</em> surfaces of the ship, try to place the      tape on the <em>outside</em> whenever possible.    </p>    <p>      Remember, too, that you may very well have to trim the      components somewhat to make them all fit properly. Don't be      afraid to do some custom tailoring . . . but do be careful      not to get carried away with the operation, or you'll      change the finished shape of the schooner.    </p>    <p>      Now, tape the bottom section to the main body pieces . . .      and then fit the front and back strips in place (you'll      have to bend the aft component somewhat, as shown by the      dotted lines on the pattern). When all is positioned      correctly, you'll have what is essentially a narrow boat      without a deck or sails . . . but don't glue the parts      together just yet!    </p>    <p>      Next, try fitting the main deck into the hull. At first the      floor will likely seem much too large, but by carefully      stretching and bending the sides of the boat, you should be      able to convince the assembly to go together. If you must      trim the deck to make it compatible with the hull, though,      try shortening - rather than narrowing - the      piece first, because the width of the deck establishes the      craft's pleasingly rounded "shipshape" contour.    </p>    <p>      Once you've managed to persuade the parts to behave, set      the deck aside for a moment and apply glue along all the      interior seams where the main body pieces meet the front      and back strips and bottom. Then lay the plank in its      notch, bottom side down, so that the stopper strips will      engage on either end.    </p>    <p>      Now, carefully position the deck in the hull and on top of      the plank and-once you've made sure the "execution board"      will slide in and out freely-tape and glue the floor      securely (be careful not to slop any adhesive on or around      the moving part). Next, take the front and rear top-deck      sections, and - after folding down a 1/2" supporting      panel on each, as shown by the dotted lines - fasten      <em>them</em> in place, too.    </p>    <p>      The ship's body is complete . . . it's time to hoist your      sails! Fit each mast into its respective slot on the main,      front, or rear deck and cement the double-thick parts in      place (be sure to add a dab of glue on the back sail, too,      where the cardboard canvas fits into its stabilizer on the      port side). Finally, let the entire assembly dry thoroughly      . . . and remove the masking tape wherever possible.    </p>		    <p>      <strong>DETAIL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Yo ho ho . . . you and your young swash-bucklers have done      it! All your ship needs now is a good paint job. I prefer      nontoxic acrylic colors, because they're permanent and easy      to clean . . . but crayons or felt-tip markers are fine to      use, too. As far as design goes . . . well, I copied the      decorations on <em>our</em> ship from a children's      storybook, but I'll bet your own imagination (or the      creative energies of your pint-sized buccaneers) can come      up with something good.    </p>    <p>      In any event, the end result is sure to be superior to      those flimsy paper punch-out toys that are found in many      children's books these days. You can't beat the low cost,      either (after all, there's no price like free!) . . . and      you and your children will have had a great time sharing      the construction experience.    </p>    <p>      And let's see: If you can make a <em>pirate ship</em> out      of cardboard, why not a biplane . . . or a castle, or a . .      . <em>hmmm</em> . . . .    </p>
