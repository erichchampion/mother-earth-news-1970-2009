                    <p>      The worldwide organization called Friends of the Earth is      one of the most effective environmental groups in existence      today, and the activities of FOE - along with a broad      range of other news concerning ecological developments      - are described each month in its publication titled      Not Man Apart<em>. You can become a member of Friends of      the Earth, and receive the excellent tabloid, by sending      $25 ($12 for students and retired people) - or $15      for a subscription only - to FOE, Dept. TMEN, 1045      Sansome Street, San Francisco, California 94111. And to      increase the reach of the organization's doings, we've      arranged to bring you this bi-monthly column, which is      prepared by the staff of FOE/NMA.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>WATER AND THE PERIPHERAL CANAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Water is dear in California. The scarcity of the liquid      - coupled with the expense of transporting it over      long distances - has created frequent conflicts      throughout the West . . . and the most recent such battle,      in the Golden State, centered on Proposition 9.    </p>    <p>      That initiative would have diverted much of northern      California's water to the southern part of the state, by      way of a proposed canal that would stretch across the      Sacramento River Delta to the California Aqueduct. And      although 60% of the relatively few "southerners" who voted      <em>approved</em> the measure, northern Californians turned      out in overwhelming numbers ... and cast their ballots      nine-to-one <em>against</em> , thereby defeating the plan.    </p>    <p>      Opponents of the Peripheral Canal charged that the massive      drainage project would damage the ecology of the delta and      of San Francisco Bay . . . and cost the taxpayers a fortune      ( <em>billions</em> !), to boot. Furthermore, many voters      believed that the south didn't really <em>need</em> the      water. And some agribusinesses - which were among      those who stood to gain the most from the project, since      85% of the state's water is used for agriculture -      joined forces with the opposition, but for a different      reason: They hoped that a less expensive waterway, with      even fewer environmental restrictions attached to it, might      be approved later if the Peripheral Canal project could be      defeated.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, newspaper editorials in the southern part of the      state blamed the low voter turnout on the fact that the NBA      championship game between Los Angeles and Philadelphia was      played on election night. The Lakers won . . . and the      initiative lost.    </p>    <p>      However, the defeat sets the stage for yet another contest      in California. Sponsors of the Water Resource Conservation      and Efficiency Act have collected enough signatures to      place a state water policy <em>reform</em> bill (the first      in 60 years) on the ballot in November. The measure would      regulate the transfer of water within the state, protect      existing water supplies, and require both urban and      agricultural consumers to develop conservation plans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ORGANIC FARMING ACT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most of MOTHER's readers have long been aware of the      advantages of natural farming methods . . . and of the      numerous drawbacks of chemical-intensive agriculture. Well,      the rising costs of fuel, synthetic fertilizers, and      pesticides have begun to add <em>their</em> weight to the      wholistic side of the argument, too, and - as a      result - organic farming bills (the first ever to be      introduced in Congress) have been submitted in both the      House and the Senate.    </p>    <p>      The proposals (Congressman Jim Weaver's HR 5618, known as      The Organic Farming Act of 1982, and Senator Patrick      Leahy's S 2485) would authorize the Secretary of      Agriculture to [1] train volunteers to help family farmers      convert to organic methods, [2] initiate related research      at six of the country's landgrant universities, [3]      distribute information about alternative farming practices      through the Cooperative Extension Service, and [4] provide      $14.5 million to promote organic agriculture.    </p>    <p>      At the time of this writing (early July), the House      proposal has received the approval of the Subcommittee on      Forests, Family Farms, and Energy ... and has moved to the      full Agriculture Committee, where its prospects seem good.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE CLEAN AIR ACT</strong> <strong>. . . AND DIRTY      DEALING</strong>    </p>    <p>      A recent Harris poll reported that 86% of the American      people support the Clean Air Act in its present form . . .      and that almost half the population believe the legislation      should be even tougher.    </p>    <p>      And by and large, the act - which became law in 1970      - has been a success. Carbon monoxide in the air      declined 33%, sulfur dioxide 20%, and suspended      particulates 7% between 1973 and 1978. Furthermore, in 1980      the President's Council on Environmental Quality reported      that the act saves 14,000 lives and generates $21 billion      in new jobs each year.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the Clean Air Act is under attack in      Congress . . . and if the currently proposed amendments to      the law are approved, the country's air quality is likely      to deteriorate substantially.    </p>    <p>      When supporters of a bill designed to <em>strengthen</em>      the Clean Air Act submitted the measure to the House      Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, a coalition of      Republicans and Democrats voted the proposal down . . . and      then replaced it with an amendment that would      <em>weaken</em> the law.    </p>    <p>      Ohio Representative Thomas Luken's HR 5252 (nicknamed the      "Dirty Air Bill" by its opponents) includes provisions that      would, for example, postpone deadlines for compliance with      minimum air-quality standards, permit increased levels of      air pollution in national parks and other "Class 1" areas,      and weaken control standards for vehicle emissions. At the      same time, Luken and his cohorts made no attempt to address      the issue of controlling toxic pollutants not yet covered      by the Clean Air Act, and - much to the annoyance of      Canadian as well as U.S. citizens - they totally      ignored the increasingly pressing problem of acid      precipitation.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, when the proposal reached the full Energy and      Commerce Committee, defenders of the Clean Air Act managed      to reinstate the 1987 deadline for compliance with ozone      and carbon monoxide standards . . . and voted to retain the      original definition of "pristine air" as worded in the 1970      law. But these were only minor victories, and the Luken      bill continues to make headway . . . toward a victory that      could well have serious health consequences for every      citizen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POLLUTION . . . THE MILKY WAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      In March, the Ala Moana Canal in downtown Honolulu turned      white with 80,000 gallons of chemical-tainted milk . . .      which was dumped into the sewer system by Meadow Gold      Dairies (the company claims the incident was accidental).      The wasted food - which left greasy, sour-smelling      clots and thousands of dead fish floating in the waterway      - was contaminated with heptachlor . . . a dangerous      chlorinated-hydrocarbon pesticide that is now seriously      jeopardizing the future of the Aloha State's dairy      industry, not to mention the health of the islands'      citizens.    </p>    <p>      Although the Environmental Protection Agency prohibits the      use of heptachlor in the U.S., Hawaiian pineapple growers      are exempt from the ban, and spray their crops with the      compound to control ants and mealybugs. Unfortunately, in      the past they've often sold the leaf trimmings from the      plants to dairy farmers . . . who in turn fed the      foliage-known as "green chop"-to their cows.    </p>    <p>      The state's milk producers, then, have been unknowingly      poisoning their cattle with heptachlor - which      accumulates in the animals' systems - and now find      that the pesticide has reached toxic levels in many of      their dairy beasts. (In some instances, products from      Hawaiian bovines have been found to contain 15 times the      EPA's allowable limit of such residues.)    </p>    <p>      Two months after the contaminated milk was detected in the      state, the Hawaiian Department of Health recalled many      dairy foods . . . including whole and low-fat milk,      half-and-half, buttermilk, yogurt, and cottage cheese. But      quantities of the tainted products had already been      consumed by the public . . . including nursing mothers,      several of whom now show excessive levels of heptachlor in      their own milk. The dairy farmers, meanwhile, have filed a      suit against the pineapple growers . . . and the state's      Attorney General is investigating the affair.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RELATED ARTICLE :</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>UPDATE Dave Brower : The Environmentalist and the      Bomb</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For an update - on and      thought-provoking remarks by - David Brower, founder      of Friends of the Earth, turn to page 94 of this      issue.</em>    </p>
