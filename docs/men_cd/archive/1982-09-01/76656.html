            		            <p>      <em>Helen and Scott Nearing are light-years ahead of most      of us when it comes to living a life of voluntary      simplicity in harmony with nature. Back in 1932 they began      homesteading a run-down farm in Vermont's Green Mountains,      and later - when the slopes around them exploded into      ski resorts in the early 50's - Helen and Scott moved      to a rocky inlet on the Maine coast. . . and started all      over again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>That's where you'll find the Nearings today: They're      still clearing brush, still building the stone structures      they're famous for, and still raising most of their      vegetarian diet themselves in productive wholistic gardens      . . . just as they've been doing for 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally, the Nearings have learned a good deal about      homesteading over the years . . . and they've agreed to      share that knowledge with MOTHER's readers in a regular      question-and-answer column. Send your queries about      self-reliant living on the land to Helen and Scott Nearing,      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville,      North Carolina 28791. Please don't expect personal replies,      though. The most frequently asked questions will be      answered here - and here only - so that we can      all benefit from what the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>My wife and I plan to build our home from locally      available materials . . . and we feel that a wood and stone      building would best meet our requirements. We'd like to      construct the dwelling under our own steam, too . . . but      so far we've been able to find only limited information      about appropriate hand tools (it seems they've all been      replaced by gas- and electricity-powered implements). At      the present time our only tools are a small wheelbarrow, a      hammer, and a couple of wrenches and screwdrivers. We'd      like to know which hand tools were especially useful in the      construction of your home, and which (if any) power tools      were essential. We'd appreciate, too, learning what      particular brands or suppliers of highquality hand tools,      for both construction and gardening, you might      recommend.</em>    </p>    <p>      Every job requires specific equipment, and constructing a      home is no exception. For a start, though, you'll find that      shovels, handsaws, garden forks, hammers, screwdrivers,      pliers, and axes will be useful for a variety of      homesteading chores ... including building a house. As for      power tools, when putting up our frst dwelling, we had both      a saw and a cement mixer that were gasoline operated.      However, these were soon replaced by hand implements, as we      felt that the power tools were too dangerous to use, and we      found them extremely noisy. The quietness and slower, more      natural rhythm of working with hand tools far outweigh the      convenience of power equipment. Our latest building venture      - which extended over three years - included a      five-room house, a garage, a workshop, and a storage area .      . . all of which were constructed by hand and built of      stone and concrete.    </p>    <p>      In answer to your last question, most of our tools were      purchased so long ago (some of them are 50 years old) that      the trade names have long since disappeared from the      handles and blades. We'd suggest looking in woodworking and      gardening magazines for suppliers. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Here are      two sources of quality hand-powered implements: Smith &      Hawken Tool Co. (Dept. TMEN, 68 Homer, Palo Alto,      California 94301) . . . and By Hand & Foot, Ltd. (Dept.      TMEN, P.O. Box 611, Brattleboro, Vermont 05301).

We were wondering whether the practice of      gathering wild foods is an important part of your lifestyle      . . . or do you prefer to depend entirely on "tame" garden      produce?</em>    </p>    <p>      We forage for wild crops only occasionally, as our      self-contained garden yields us plenty of fruits and      vegetables for the year. Rather than traipse through the      woods in search of various herbs and edible weeds, we find      it easier to raise some "wild" crops right in our own plot.      Dandelions, for example, can be cut from the lawn . . . but      we also plant a row of the greens in the garden. And      although we do pick sorrel and chamomile when we happen to      discover them growing wild, we cultivate the plants, as      well. The same holds true for blueberries, raspberries, and      strawberries: We gather the delectable wild fruits wherever      they're found . . . but we grow tame berries within our      garden walls, too.    </p>    <p>      <em>I've been following a vegetarian lifestyle for the past      two years and - largely as a result of my desire to      consume only pesticide-free food - I've become      interested in French intensive gardening. Furthermore,      because composting naturally goes hand in hand with growing      vegetables, one of my recent projects was to build up a      sizable pile of decomposing material.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Being short on vegetable matter, I contacted the local      grocery store and worked out a deal whereby I receive all      the store's rotten produce. However, after layering a      month's worth of the humus-to-be in a blanket of dirt and      leaves, it crossed my mind that the vegetables supplied to      the store were probably sprayed with pesticides . . . and      that as a result the waste might not be suitable for      composting.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Do you know whether commercial insecticides will break      down sufficiently to be safe in a compost pile?</em>    </p>    <p>      We've never lived close enough to a restaurant or      supermarket to have the chance of using throwaways . . . so      we haven't dealt with a situation like yours. We'd suggest,      however, that you mix the store-gathered vegetable matter      with your own homegrown leafage and weeds in order to      dilute the concentration of possible poisons in your      compost pile. Adding on layers of well. decayed leaves      should also decrease the proportion of impurities in the      organic matter. And be sure to let your pile heat up      sufficiently - reaching at least 110Â°F - to      help destroy detrimental <em>organisms</em> that may infest      the supermarket leftovers.    </p>    <p>      <em>I realize that you haven't had to deal with this      specific problem . . . nevertheless I'd like to have your      comments.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We are a family of five living on 14 acres in rural      western Quebec. Some time ago we decided to teach our      children at home, since my husband and I feel that removing      our youngsters from the mediocre quality of education found      in the public school system is perfectly consistent with      our goal of living a simple, honest, self-reliant life. We      are a bit concerned, however, with the troublesome issue of      socializing. We're afraid that the decision not to send our      children to the local school could, perhaps, remove us from      "social acceptance" in the community . . . and as a result,      our youngsters might well suffer for our beliefs.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We assume (from reading the chapter on "Living in a      Community" in your book</em> Living the Good Life <em>)      that - in a similar situation - you wouldn't      simply adopt an isolationist stance. What are your thoughts      on this subject?</em>    </p>    <p>      Social acceptance was never a concern of ours . . . and      we'd like to believe that most other mature adults would be      firm enough in their own convictions to stand up for what      they believe in, even if doing so meant running against the      norm. Children, however, are - in general -      quite concerned with the opinions of their peers. We would      hope that, were we in your situation, we'd be able to      influence our youngsters to see beyond that . . . by      formulating our own family standards and living up to what      we believe is right. Moreover, we feel that a bout with      social acceptability now and then isn't always a bad      experience . . . on the contrary, it can be a valuable      lesson for both young and old!    </p>
