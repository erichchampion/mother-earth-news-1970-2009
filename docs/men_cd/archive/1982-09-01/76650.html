                    <p>      Before Barbara Black freezes her bags of freshly baked      bread and muffins, she puts one end of a drinking straw      into each sack and gently sucks the air out. Then the      Woodbridge, Virginia baker twists the ties to seal the bags      . . . and pops the goodies into the freezer. Barbara claims      the extra airtightness helps keep her frozen treats fresh.    </p>        <p>      Next time you're looking for an easy way to "pop" the bead      from a tire rim, you might try Dale Isackson's trick. Dale,      a reader from Two Harbors, Minnesota, uses a pick-mattock      - minus the handle - for the task. He first      runs a 5-foot steel bar through the hole provided for the      handle of the tool . . . and then places one end of the bar      in a hole in his garage door frame. By placing the blade      between the rim and the bead, and then taking the valve out      of the valve stem, Dale can pop the tire's bead by simply      pressing down on the other end of the steel rod.    </p>    <p>      Mary Markland makes her own breast shields by folding a      cloth diaper into six to eight thicknesses. The Sebring,      Floridian then cuts out a circle, using pinking shears, and      sews the multiple layers together. Mary says the shields      are a help when she's breastfeeding, because they prevent      milk from staining her clothing.    </p>    <p>      Another of MOM's readers - Mary Hagemann of Douglas,      Wyoming - also sent us instructions for making      homemade shields. <em>This</em> Mary uses an old dish      towel, and sandwiches a layer of clear plastic wrap between      two terry cloth circles. Once they've been sewn together      with a lock stitch, Mary reports, the shields will      withstand several machine washings.    </p>    <p>      If you scorch a pot of pinto beans, peas, or some other      legume, don't despair. Instead, take a tip from Jeanne      Bolick of Hickory, North Carolina. Jeanne simply adds a      peeled raw potato to the pot . . . which, she says, quickly      absorbs the scorched flavor. (An uncooked spud will also      soak up the excess salt from an overly seasoned pot of      beans.)    </p>    <p>      When Carol Saturensky-Young cans fruits, she prefers not to      use the sugary syrups most folks recommend. Instead, the      Merlin, Oregon reader cans her apples, peaches, and berries      in unsweetened apple juice. The juice can be bottled,      filtered or not filtered, frozen or fresh, cider or juice,      or even diluted slightly. She never adds sugar or honey,      although occasionally she includes a little lemon juice.      Carol has found that the apple "nectar" makes a great      canning syrup, and combines with the flavor of the fruit in      a most pleasing way! [EDITOR'S NOTE: You may well have to      increase your processing time because of the lack of sugar      syrup's preserving action.]    </p>    <p>      "Whenever you order merchandise through the mail, write the      address of the firm you're dealing with on the back of the      check," recommends Holly Hughes of Oakdale, Connecticut.      "Then, if there's any problem with the merchandise -      or if you don't receive it - you'll have the      information you'll need in order to write the company there      on the canceled check . . . which can save a lot of      frustration."    </p>    <p>      Broken tool handles can be useful around the homestead,      according to Kenneth Scharabok of Wright Patterson Air      Force Base in Ohio. Ken has - for instance -      used the good hardwood from two broken shovel handles to      make a grip for a froe . . . a replacement handle for a      crosscut saw . . . and a shaft for a three-pound hammer.    </p>    <p>      Ashley Sweda is a hunter, fisherman, and trapper by trade.      And the Tionesta, Pennsylvanian has found a way to make use      of <em>all</em> parts of the animals he hunts and traps:      The Keystone Stater simply buries any unused portions of      the carcasses in his garden. The extra nitrogen, bone meal,      and other nutrients have proven their worth in the past two      harvest seasons. Ashley says that the neighbors looked on      with a wary eye for a while, but were won over when they      received part of his garden's ample harvest.    </p>    <p>      "Hospital stays - especially extended ones -      can be terribly depressing. If you know someone going in      for a long while, here's a way to add a little sunshine to      his or her stay," write Sue Wylly and Dolores Dux of      Savannah, Georgia. "Go through every magazine you can find      and cut out all the coupons offering free samples . . .      then send them in with your friend's name and hospital      address. (You may have to include a small handling charge      in some cases.) Soon all sorts of mysterious little boxes      and envelopes will start arriving, containing everything      from shampoo to tulip bulbs to pet food . . . and the      patient will be diverted from thoughts of his or her      illness for a while."    </p>    <p>      Once each month, Cindi Workman mixes up a solution of two      teaspoons of regular household ammonia and one gallon of      lukewarm water, and feeds the liquid to her indoor plants.      According to the Bancroft, Michigan reader, her leafy      friends green up . . . stand nice and straight . . . and      put out lots of new growth. Sound strange? Well, Cindi says      that some farmers invest a good bit of money in the      anhydrous ammonia they use on <em>their</em> crops!    </p>    <p>      You can clean your washing machine by filling it with warm      water and adding a gallon of distilled (white) vinegar to      it, according to Mary Cucher of Memphis, Tennessee. Mary      simply runs the liquid through an entire wash cycle . . .      and finds that the vinegar effectively cleans all of the      hoses, removing soap scum.    </p>    <p>      Patricia Blundell and her husband have come up with a way      to keep neighborhood pets and wild marauders out of their      garbage while the couple accumulates enough noncompostable      trash to warrant a trip to the dump. The Lakebay,      Washington residents store their tied plastic garbage bags      in a wooden utility trailer that's equipped with wire and      insulators and hooked to a battery-powered fence charger.      One zap convinces most wandering animals to leave well      enough alone. (Pat tells us her dog won't even walk on that      side of the house!) The charger is disconnected from the      trailer whenever the vehicle is moved or emptied, but the      wire stays on. The Blundells report that they've lent the      fence charger to friends and neighbors who've installed      similar setups around <em>their</em> garbage cans. A few      weeks with the zapper in place is usually enough to educate      most animals to "steer clear".    </p>    <p>      <em>Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
