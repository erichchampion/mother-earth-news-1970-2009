                    <h2 id="subtitle">ORGANIZING YOUR LIFE TO REDUCE STRESS</h2>   <h5 id="byline">by       Tom Ferguson, M.D.    </h5>        <p>      We're all subject to the pressures of modern-day living . .      . but people who are badly disorganized are likely to      impose even <em>more</em> stress upon themselves. And that      additional strain can (and almost certainly will) affect      their health adversely.    </p>    <p>      Some lucky souls seem to be naturally organized (and the      really lucky ones aren't <em>too</em> organized). But if      you feel that you could benefit from a bit more order in      your daytoday existence, just make a firm commitment to put      the past behind you . . . and use the following tips to      guide you toward better organization and less stress.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NINE GUIDELINES</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 1: Keep a planning notebook.</em> By maintaining a      cumulative master list of jobs that need doing, problems to      be solved, and goals you'd someday like to reach -      and by adding to the roster whenever an item occurs to you      - you'll find yourself focusing on achieving your      aims rather than simply on trying to remember what they      are.    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 2: Maintain a daily "to do" list.</em> It's a good      idea to start a rough draft of your job catalog the day      before the tasks must be done (just write them down as they      come to mind). Then, the next morning, read through the      docket and mark each item "A" for <em>very important</em> ,      "B" for <em>important</em> , or "C" for <em>less      important</em> . Now, rank the jobs within each of those      groups: Label "A" items "A-1", "A-2", "A-3", etc. and do      the same with the "B" and "C" categories. Finally, compose      a finished draft, listing all entries in      descending-priority order.    </p>    <p>      As you go through your day, try not to give in to the      temptation to skip over important tasks to do lesser ones.      Stick to your <em>original</em> ratings . . . and attempt      to cross out <em>all</em> the entries by the end of the      evening.    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 3: Establish lifetime objectives.</em> For example,      ask yourself, "How would I like to spend the next five . .      . ten . . . or fifteen years? If I knew I were going to die      in six months, what would I want to do between now and      then?"    </p>    <p>      Another technique is to compose a scenario for an ideal day      in your life five or ten years hence. Describe where and      how you'd be living, and follow your activities from      morning through night. Make it a day that you'd find fully      satisfying in terms of work and play, friends and family,      health and environment.    </p>    <p>      Once you've given the matter some thought, you should be      able to come up with a list of very specific lifetime      objectives. Write them down in your planning notebook, and      review them from time to time . . . just to keep yourself      "on track".    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 4: Use an appointment calendar . . . and schedule      time for self-care</em> . A daybook can be invaluable in      helping you to remember meetings and bill payments and the      like. But remember, too, to make appointments with      <em>yourself</em> - for relaxing, reading,      exercising, listening to music, sunbathing, or whatever      - and with your family and friends.    </p>    <p>      Also, try to structure breaks for yourself during working      hours. Obviously, this won't be as easy for some as it will      for others (depending on the particular job), but you      should at least try to give yourself a real lunch hour and      - if possible - set aside one or two brief rest      periods in which you can take a walk or perhaps phone a      friend. Do your best to <em>quit</em> working at a fixed      time each day, too . . . most people are more productive      when they know they have only so many hours (rather than      "all night") to get the jobs done.    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 5: Establish a</em> <em>regular planning time</em>      . Once a day (morning seems to be best for most people),      sit down and review your cumulative list of comments and      tasks. Complete your "to do" roster . . . and if you've      written down a problem that needs solving, try to develop a      plan of action.    </p>    <p>      Once a week or so, you'll want to hold a long-range      planning session. Attempt to look at least several months      ahead, to get a better idea of what you'll be doing then .      . . and to determine whether you need to be making      preparations now.    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 6: Examine how you use your days</em> . I guarantee      that if you keep a detailed time log over a period of three      days - that is, if you write down precisely      <em>how</em> you've spent those minutes and hours -      you'll be surprised at the results.    </p>    <p>      Most people find that they spend only one-third to one-half      as much time on productive projects as they thought. And      once you're aware that you're wasting much of your day, you      can make a conscious effort to avoid all the sidetracks      that rob you of qual ity time . . . and to match your tasks      - easy and difficult - with periods of      typically high and low energy.    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 7: Don't let "impossible" problems intimidate      you</em> . There's simply no such thing as a dilemma so      complex that it can't be solved. The secret is to break big      problems down into smaller, more manageable units . . . and      then tackle one component task at a time.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, when most people are confronted with a      quandry of seemingly insurmountable proportions, they tend      to shy away from the difficulty altogether. And as many of      us have found out the hard way, the longer we neglect      problems, the larger they're likely to grow.    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 8: Learn to unload unnecessary tasks . . . and to      say no</em> . Chances are you're being robbed of at least      <em>some</em> time every day . . . either by others, or by      your own inclination to do things that you don't      <em>need</em> to do or that you're making more work of than      necessary.    </p>    <p>      The next time you review each entry in your notebook's      "problems and tasks" list, ask yourself, "Would there be      any serious consequences if I <em>didn't</em> do this?" If      your answer is no, cross the job off!    </p>    <p>      When you do undertake a task, try your best to      <em>complete</em> it . . . don't leave more work for      yourself to do later. (Many people have a hard time      tackling mail and paper work, for example. Instead of      immediately responding to each piece in turn, they tend to      shuffle the work around . . . and usually end up with a      kind of perpetual "to do soon" pile.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, teach yourself to say no to people who ask you to      do things you don't want or need to do. Many of us find it      difficult to refuse a request or an invitation . . . but      remember, it's your time. Saying no doesn't make you a      "mean" person ... it can, rather, show that you're an      honest individual in control of your own life.    </p>    <p>      <em>No. 9: Don't hesitate to ask for help.</em> You're not      alone in this world. When you're up to your ears in work,      there's no reason why you shouldn't request a little      assistance.    </p>    <p>      If you're having trouble getting your finances in order,      for instance, ask a friend who's good with numbers to come      to your rescue . . . and offer to return the favor in some      way.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you must remember that the concept of helping      works <em>both</em> ways, so look for - and welcome      - opportunities to be of use to those around you.      When you do, you'll find that a little cooperative giving      and taking among neighbors and friends makes life not only      simpler, but more fulfilling and satisfying as well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN ENCOURAGING WORD</strong>    </p>    <p>      I think you can see from the guidelines I've listed that      eliminating the stress caused by an unnecessarily      complicated life is frequently only a matter of exercising      common sense and a few simple techniques.    </p>    <p>      In fact, there may be no such thing as an inherently      orderly person. As far as I've observed, "well-organized"      people are really just slobs with a system!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: There are many helpful</em> <em>books      available on this subject, and here are a few that Dr.      Ferguson recommends.</em> Getting Organized <em>by      Stephanie Winston (Warner Books, 1980, $5.95) is an      excellent volume on household management. If you want      assistance in focusing on lifetime goals, you'll find      invaluable advice in</em> How to Get Control of Your Time      and Your Life <em>by Alan Lakein (Signet, 1974, $2.50). And      Tony and Robbie Fanning's</em> Get It All Done and Still Be      Human <em>(Chilton, 1979, $8.95) details a refreshingly      free-spirited approach to personal organization.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Dr. Tom Ferguson's quarterly journal,</em> Medical      Self-Care <em>, is available for $15 per year from Medical      Self-Care, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 717, Inverness, California      94937. A sample issue costs $4.00. Dr. Ferguson's book,      also titled Medical Self-Care, can be ordered - for      $8.95 plus 95 cents shipping and handling - from      Mother's Bookshelf (restricted) P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28791.</em>    </p>
