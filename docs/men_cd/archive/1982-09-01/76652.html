            <p>      Issue #77 - September/October 1982</p>			<p>In issue 37, Bill      Wodraska shared some of his thoughts regarding one of      humankind's better ideas - barter - and offered      up an interesting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing      feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said      Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for      contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied .      . . and announced our still-standing offer: Anyone who      sends us a short account of an actual barter that gets      printed in this column (write THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      &reg P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791)      will receive a 12-month subscription (new or extended) to      MOTHER.    </p>        <p>      Because the village I live in (a small community in the      mountains of Washington state) is quite isolated from any      large city, my neighbors and I are self-reliant folks by      necessity. For example, we generate all of the electrical      "juice" we need with a small-scale hydropower plant, we      operate our own drinking water system, and we tackle the      inevitable community machinery repairs . . . all in      addition to raising most of our food.    </p>    <p>      Despite these efforts to be self-sufficient, however, we      still find that occasionally there's work to be done that      requires specific skills which no one in the community can      supply . . . such as putting in a bit of complicated      electrical wiring or drawing up architectural plans for a      new building. And - since our cash flow is limited      - in those rare instances when we do have to seek      outside help, we turn to barter as a way to "pay" our      visitors.    </p>    <p>      Usually, we trade a week or so of room and board in our      backwoods community in return for the needed services. The      village then gets the required work completed, and the      volunteer enjoys a free vacation in the mountains! It must      be a pretty even exchange, too, because to date our swap      offers have <em>never</em> been refused!    </p>    <p>      In fact, this arrangement has worked out so well for us      that I'm surprised more folks don't make similar deals. If      you live on a small farm - or in a coveted location      in the city - and need help with a chore that's      beyond your ability, try trading a week's room and board      for the task. I think you'll be pleased with the response      you'll get!    </p>    <p>      <strong>H. H.</strong> <strong><br />      Washington</strong>    </p>    <p>      With seven children to keep warm, my husband and I spent a      lot of time searching for an inexpensive way to heat our      rambling ten-room home. We finally decided that wood was      our best bet, so we built a double-barrel Sotz      timber-burner and then set to the task of finding fuel for      it.    </p>    <p>      Hardwood is a dear commodity in this part of the Buckeye      State, so when I spied a demolition crew tearing down the      old wooden grain elevator at the farmer's co-op, I couldn't      resist stopping and inquiring about the possibility of      swapping for some of the wood. The manager allowed that he      didn't know much about bartering, but he did give me the      name of the contractor in charge of razing the structure.    </p>    <p>      A phone call later, we learned that the crew needed a      location at which to dump the materials they'd cleared away      . . . and it just so happened that we'd recently purchased      a few acres near the construction site.    </p>    <p>      Well, it's been three years since we made that trade . . .      and this will be the first winter that we'll be looking for      fuel again. That one inquiry, you see, furnished us with 14      truckloads of lumber. (In fact, we ended up with such an      abundance of wood that we used some of our "surplus" to      build a garage, an enclosed porch, and a deck!) The swap      also provided us with a bit of spare cash, as we were able      to sell the grain elevator's exterior corrugated metal to a      salvage yard.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes, it seems that striking up a deal is as simple as      finding the courage to propose it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>P. W.</strong> <strong><br />      Ohio</strong>    </p>    <p>      I've always read the swapping stories in your magazine with      interest, but I used to think it wasn't likely that      <em>I'd</em> ever encounter a situation where I could offer      a trade. Well, last summer I finally got the chance to do a      little bartering . . . and I loved it! Here's how the deal      came about.    </p>    <p>      My husband and I had promised our children a day at the      county fair . . . but as the date of the holiday approached      and we counted our pennies, we came up short on pocket      money. We decided to go anyway, and told the youngsters      that we'd spend the day looking at the exhibits. When we      saw the disappointment in their faces, however, we relented      and promised <em>two</em> amusement rides apiece.    </p>    <p>      The day of the fair was cool and lovely, and we saw all the      exhibits at least twice . . . but finally the children      couldn't resist the lure of the midway any longer. With a      heavy heart I followed them down the path to the amusement      area and doled out the cost of two "goes" each. As I did      so, I recalled the fairs I'd attended as a child - in      the days when tickets weren't so overpriced - and the      fun I'd had trying every ride. There must be something I      could do to give my youngsters that same enjoyment, I      thought . . . and then I remembered your barter reports. If      other folks could trade, I reasoned, so could I!    </p>    <p>      So while my husband watched the little ones, I marched off      to the manager's office and, meeting his wife at the door,      nervously proposed swapping some homemade goodies (I      thought doughnuts might be a suitable item) for a supply of      tickets. The woman was a bit surprised at my request, but      the idea obviously appealed to her . . . she admitted that      fresh-from-the-oven (or deep-fryer) treats were rare in      their home, thanks to the transient life she and her      husband led. The two of them conferred for a few minutes,      and she returned with a beaming smile and a fistful of      passes amounting to $54 worth of rides!    </p>    <p>      You can bet that a weary but very happy family headed for      home that afternoon. And once an early dinner was over,      baths had been taken, and the youngsters were tucked in, I      flew to the kitchen. The carnival was moving on the      following day, you see, and I planned to keep my part of      the bargain no matter how tired I felt! By nine o'clock      that night I was driving back to town, laden with three      dozen doughnuts and two large, warm loaves of banana bread.    </p>    <p>      As I happily handed over the fragrant food, I asked whether      we could strike up a similar bargain the next year. Judging      from the response I got, it looks as if I'll be trading      with those folks on an annual basis from now on!    </p>    <p>      <strong>B.J.<br /></strong> <strong>Minnesota</strong>    </p>    <p>      My husband is an avid angler, so naturally we enjoy a good      number of fresh-caught fillets during fishing season.      Recently, however, we've discovered that his catches can      land us <em>more</em> than just tasty meals. One of my      spouse's fishing buddies, for instance, is an auto mechanic      . . . and in exchange for cleaning <em>all</em> the fish      the two of them catch, my husband receives free repair      service for our cars.    </p>    <p>      Even a landlubber friend, our children's dentist, gets in      on the fishy deals! He has no interest in handling a reel      or a rod but does crave a fresh-from-the-lake meal now and      then. So - at his suggestion - each time one of      our youngsters needs dental work, I bring the doc a mess of      finny critters.    </p>    <p>      Now, I'm trying to hook another deal: these "fish stories"      for a year's subscription. Any takers?    </p>    <p>      <strong>M.A.M.</strong><br />      <strong>Arizona</strong>    </p>
