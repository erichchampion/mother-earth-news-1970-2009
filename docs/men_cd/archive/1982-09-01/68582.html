                    <p>      <strong>Lately, more and more people have begun to      understand just how limited - variety and nutritional      value - our "modern" diets have become. This      realization has sparked a new and widespread interest in      the culinary and therapeutic uses of herbs . . . those      plants which - although not well-known today -      were, just one short generation ago honored guests' on the      dinner tables and in the medicine chests of our      grandparents homes. In this regular feature, MOTHER will      examine the availability cultivation and benefits of our      "forgotten" vegetable foods and remedies and - we      hope - help prevent the loss of still another bit of      ancestral lore.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Most of the herbs we now enjoy have been known - and      valued - since antiquity . . . and tall, feathery      dill ( <em>Anethum graueolens</em> ) is no exception.      Records of its use as a digestive aid have been found in      the tombs of ancient Egypt . . . called "aneth", it was      said to strengthen gladiators in the days of the Roman      Empire . . . with that name mistranslated as "anise", the      herb was declared an insufficient tithe in the gospel of      St. Matthew . . . and during the Middle Ages it was known      as a powerful charm against witchcraft! Its uses -      and possibly misuses - have varied through the      centuries, and today we're most familiar with the herb as a      simple food flavoring.    </p>           <p>      Although both dillweed (that is, the leaves) and dillseed      are employed in culinary and therapeutic preparations, the      latter is most commonly used in medicine . . . and many      household remedies are effected with dill water. To make      this herbal medication, bruise about an ounce of the seed      and soak it in a pint of cold water for six hours. Then      sweeten the resulting infusion, to taste, with honey, and      give one tablespoon to an adult (or one teaspoon to a      child) to relieve indigestion. And since the word      <em>dill</em> derives from a Norse term meaning "to lull",      it should come as no surprise that dill water, rubbed on a      mother's breast, is believed to help a nursing infant fall      asleep after feeding.    </p>    <p>      Nowadays, of course, the herb is valued primarily for its      virtues in the kitchen. For instance, dillweed is a      delightful flavor enhancer when used with poached or baked      fish, seafood salad, and shrimp . . . while a pinch in      cottage cheese or potato salad will lift those foods out of      the ordinary and into the category of gourmet treats. In      soups and sauces, dips and pickles, breads and vegetables,      a touch of dill adds special piquancy. Therefore, the cook      who enjoys using herbs will find a jar of dillweed and      another of dillseed all but essential in the kitchen.    </p>          <p>      An annual, dill is easily grown from seed (which can be      obtained from almost any outlet that sells herb seeds). It      likes full sun, plenty of water, and well-drained garden      soil. The plant's main stalk is smooth, shiny, and hollow.      Its many branchlets bear lacy foliage and - in      midsummer - flat umbels of tiny yellow flowers that      later give way to quantities of flat seed.    </p>    <p>      The kernels should be harvested in early morning or late      afternoon of a dry day . . . just as the lower ones are      beginning to ripen. Simply insert the entire umbel into a      paper bag and clip it off . . . the upper seeds will mature      on the flower head as it dries.    </p>    <p>      The fresh foliage will be most flavorful if it's picked for      kitchen use before the plants bloom or immediately after      seeds have formed. Dill leaves can be frozen or dried. To      dehydrate the foliage, it's best to simply place it on a      screen in a shady, well-ventilated area for a day or two. A      low-temperature oven can be used to complete the procedure,      if necessary (remember, though, that dillweed loses its      color and flavor if the drying process is too prolonged),      and the leaves should then be stored in tightly sealed      jars.    </p>    <p>      As a companion plant, dill is said to provide some      protection for cabbage, cucumbers, lettuce, onions, and      young - not mature - carrots (dig it out or cut      it before it blossoms, as many gardeners claim that the      plant in bloom has an inhibiting effect on carrots'      growth). Finally, take care not to plant dill anywhere near      its relative fennel, or the plants will cross-pollinate . .      . with disappointing results!    </p>
