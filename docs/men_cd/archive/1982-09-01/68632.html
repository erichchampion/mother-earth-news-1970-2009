                <p>      <em>Got too few hands to carry homestead gear? Let the U.S.      Army solve your problem with . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Bill W. Furlow    </h5>    <p>      When my mate Gayle and I moved our family out to our Oregon      homestead, we discovered that some of the fences on the      property hadn't been tended for more than <em>ten      years</em> , so the underbrush along those borders had      grown completely out of control. Well, I knew that walking      the fenceline to make repairs (it's a two-mile hike around      the perimeter!) would be tough going, and that -      since I'd be clearing brush <em>and</em> mending boundaries      - I'd need a variety of tools to get the job done.      But I <em>didn't</em> know how to manage this task without      having to run back to the house every time I wanted a      different implement.    </p>    <p>      "What I need," I decided, "is something that will let me      carry <em>everything</em> the job requires, yet leave my      hands free to actually do the work." After cogitating      awhile, I realized that soldiers in the field face exactly      the same problem . . . and <em>that</em> revelation led me      to my local army surplus store where - sure enough      - I discovered the perfect solution.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUCKLE UP</strong>    </p>        <p>      The apparatus I found at the shop is known among military      types as "LBE" (load-bearing equipment) or "web gear" . . .      and its basic components are a pistol belt, from which you      can hang a variety of tools and carrying pouches, and a      pair of heavy-duty suspenders to help hold the whole      assortment up.    </p>    <p>      The outfit distributes the weight of the attached      paraphernalia (it's supported at my waist and both      shoulders) and moves easily with me . . . so wearing it for      hours on end isn't uncomfortable or tiring. And because      both my hands are left free, I can use them to lug any      heavy <em>major</em> tools (such as an axe, a sledgehammer,      or a chain saw) that I might need on a given day. What's      more, my fence-mending belt system - including      canteen, machete, and folding shovel - cost me about      $35!    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMPONENTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's a breakdown of the main elements that make up my      tool-toter . . . and some observations that I hope can help      you put together an <em>equally</em> economical and      efficient setup.    </p>    <p>      <em>Pistol belt.</em> The basic design of this particular      piece of military apparel hasn't changed significantly      since World War I days. It's simply a wide waistband      perforated all around with metal eyelets that accommodate      various hardware-holding hooks or brackets. Belt prices      range from around $3.00 for a well-used, cotton-web version      to $5.00 for imported copies (such as the made-in-Taiwan      model I bought) . . . and up to $10 for a modern U.S.-issue      green nylon one with a quick-release buckle.    </p>    <p>      <em>Suspenders.</em> Over the years both the Army and the      Marine Corps have produced these belt supporters in a      number of different styles. The ones I purchased -      for a measly $1.98 - appear to be made of cotton, and      are stamped "U.S." and "1948" in black ink. (The same store      offered a new green nylon pair for a whopping $12!)    </p>        <p>      <em>Canteens.</em> There are two kinds: military-issue      plastic water holders (currently priced between $1.00 and      $2.00 apiece) and an <em>aluminum</em> version (which costs      from $2.50 to $4.00). A heavy cotton carrying pouch for one      canteen costs $2.00 to $4.00 (depending, of course, on the      item's age and condition).    </p>    <p>      <em>Folding shovel.</em> In the service it's officially      referred to as an "entrenching tool" . . . but I just call      the little digger <em>useful</em> . It's eminently portable      and has a blade that can be locked in either shovel or pick      position. Mine is an old-style model, with a folding wooden      handle, that was already beat up when I bought it for $2.00      (you can pay as much as $4.00 for one in better shape). The      cloth holster for my tool is in mint condition and cost      $1.50.    </p>    <p>      The military stopped using the classic wooden-handled      shovel 10 or 12 years ago and replaced it with an all-metal      version (current price: $8.50) that folds at <em>two</em>      points and fits entirely inside an inexpensive plastic      carrying case. This new design is a big improvement,      because the old model's wooden shaft tends to smack you in      the back of the legs every time you take a step. You can      also buy <em>civilian</em> -made copies of the new shovel,      by the way . . . they're manufactured of much lighter-gauge      steel and are consequently priced lower (about $5.50), but      they do seem capable of withstanding hard use.    </p>    <p>      <em>Machete.</em> If you need one of these oversized knives      for cutting brush and such, take my advice and buy the very      finest you can afford. (I bought the <em>cheapest</em> one      I could find . . . and after a year's use the blade is      badly dinged and its plastic handle is cracked.) You can      expect to pay around $12 for a machete like mine and at      least twice that amount for a really good one.    </p>        <p>      <em>Ammo pouches.</em> Surplus stores usually carry lots of      these canvas pockets in a wide variety of shapes, sizes,      <em>and</em> prices (from a buck to a sawbuck). One or two      should be sufficient for carrying nails and fence-wire      staples. If you want to, you can purchase a larger one as      well . . . for packing along a couple of sandwiches.    </p>    <p>      <em>First</em> <em>aid pouches.</em> These little fabric      pockets have snap-down flaps and slip right onto loops on      my front suspender straps. The pouches were originally      designed to carry a compact field bandage, and I usually      wear one of the strap pockets for that purpose and/or to      carry a compass. Since they're only $1.50 each, though, I      suggest that you go ahead and buy two or three . . . they      can come in mighty handy.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hammer holder.</em> This is the only <em>non</em>      -military item on my belt (I just couldn't find an Army      version). It's basically a sturdy leather panel with a      strong steel loop riveted to it . . . I just slip the      carrier onto my belt and pass the handle of my hammer,      fencing pliers, or whatever through the metal ring. I      bought the device for under $3.00 at my local Montgomery      Ward store. (Most hardware shops also carry hammer      holders.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Elastic bands.</em> Ordnance officers refer to these as      "blousing straps" or "boot bands" (soldiers use them to      hold the bottoms of their trousers to their boots). The      straps have a small metal hook at each end and stretch to      more than twice their seven-inch length . . . which makes      them very handy for securing rolled-up bulky items (such as      my poncho, a <em>must</em> here in Oregon) to my belt. At      50 cents a pair, they're a real bargain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OTHER USES</strong>    </p>    <p>      The real beauty of this load-bearing equipment is that it      allows you to customize the rig to suit a particular job by      simply selecting the most appropriate components for the      task at hand. The accessories I've listed go together to      make an ideal fence-mending outfit . . . but I can easily      change to different kinds of holders to accommodate the      gear needed for other work. If I'm going out to cut      firewood, for example, I can take the hammer and shovel      <em>off</em> my belt, and <em>add</em> a large pouch or two      for carrying a bar wrench and extra saw chains.    </p>    <p>      There are lots of other web-gear accessories available,      too, such as larger first aid kits, sleeping-bag carriers,      and even small knapsacks, known as a "fanny packs". One      young lad who works around our farm uses these items with      his LBE when he goes camping, and he says the rig is much      more comfortable than conventional equipment.    </p>    <p>      I hope you'll give the outfit a try. It's a great way to      lighten your load . . . and - if you're like me      - you'll feel good about converting military hardware      into instruments for more peaceful purposes. In fact,      whenever I wear my tool-toter, I think of the Biblical      passage from the book of Isaiah: " <em>They shall beat      their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning      hooks . . . .</em> "    </p>    <p>      Not a bad idea, eh?    </p>
