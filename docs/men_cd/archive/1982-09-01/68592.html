                <p>      <em>When nights turn chill, and days grow wee, this Gopher      State couple gets wild rice</em> <em>. . . free!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Bob Cary    </h5>    <p>      If you enjoy the nutty goodness and subtle flavor of wild      rice (and <em>most</em> folks do!), you probably already      know that the glamour grain is one of the most expensive      foodstuffs around . . . often selling for as much as $12      per pound! However, top-quality wild rice <em>can</em> be      yours for a tiny fraction of that amount. In fact, my wife      Lil and I collect our own supply each fall . . . by      prowling the lakes and waterways near our north woods home      in search of the coveted wild edible.    </p>    <p>      Called <em>manomin</em> by our Chippewa Indian neighbors,      and <em>Zizania aquatica</em> by botanists (who classify it      as a grass, rather than a true rice), this highly      nutritious cereal grain is still being harvested in      essentially the same manner as it was by native Americans      centuries ago . . . that is, by knocking it off the stalks      and into a canoe, using a pair of wooden sticks. Indeed,      many states have laws designed to see that rice gathering      <em>remains</em> an unmechanized activity. And while it's      true that the regulations contribute to the high price of      the delicacy, it seems likely that without such      restrictions commercial interests would soon overharvest      the grain . . . perhaps to the point of extinction.    </p>    <p>      This native of shallow, mud-bottomed water could once be      found in an area ranging from the plains states to the      Atlantic, and from southern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.      Today, however, although a few scattered stands have      survived the ravages of drainage, dredging, and pollution      along the Mississippi River and the Gulf and Atlantic      shores, the main harvest occurs in the lake country of the      "rice bowl" states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota .      . . and in the Canadian provinces from Saskatchewan      eastward.    </p>    <p>      In our area - the heart of the Superior National      Forest near Ely, Minnesota - there are more than      1,500 sizable rice beds and hundreds of smaller ones. But      don't go into a gastronomic frenzy just yet. Simply knowing      that this aquatic cereal <em>exists</em> in a given region      won't guarantee that you'll be able to find and harvest the      sought-after annual.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MY HEART KNOWS WHERE THE WILD RICE GROWS</strong>    </p>              <p>      Veteran ricers tend to be as closemouthed about their      "private" patches as prospectors are about beds of      gold-bearing gravel ... and for good reason. What with the      high prices commanded by this uncultivated delicacy,      commercial operators have been known to move in on a find      and harvest the major part of the stand in a matter of days      . . . or hours!    </p>    <p>      During the final days of August and into early September,      when the nights are cool and the days growing short, wild      rice begins to ripen rapidly. An entire patch of grain      isn't likely to reach maturation all at once, however, so a      harvesting team can go over the same area at intervals a      few days apart and expect to gather a good supply on each      trip.    </p>    <p>      And just how does one <em>find</em> a stand of wild rice?      Well, some experienced ricers just seem to "know in their      hearts" where to look for the delectable treat . . . but,      for the rest of us, the best way to locate a patch is to      search out the golden stalks before the grain begins to      ripen. In most states within the tasty grass's range, the      department of agriculture will provide reasonably accurate      - although admittedly general - information      about ricing areas . . . but the whereabouts of the best      stands in any particular year probably <em>won't</em> be      part of the package. Lil and I get occasional tips from      conservation officers and fisherfolk, too, but our most      rewarding method (in more ways than one!) of "prospecting"      is simply to spot and make note of the rice while enjoying      August canoe excursions.    </p>    <p>      Throughout the month before the harvest begins, you see,      the stalks protrude well above the surface of the water in      likely ponds .. . in the shallow, mud-bottomed bays of the      larger lakes . . . along meandering creeks . . . and in the      mucky estuaries where streams empty into larger bodies of      water.    </p>    <p>      The root systems are anchored in mud, which will be      anywhere from a few inches to as much as two feet beneath      the water's surface, and the stalks rise from two to five      feet in height. The grain is clustered at the top of the      main stem. When completely filled out and ripe, the seeds      range from a half-inch to more than an inch in length,      varying in color from light green to brown.    </p>    <p>      Over the years we've cataloged some <em>two dozen</em> good      harvesting grounds, ranging from relatively small stands of      approximately five acres, to giant granaries of more than a      hundred.    </p>    <p>      Since the yield and quality of an area's crop may vary      sharply from year to year, we simply canoe past a number of      our favorite patches, mentally marking out those we think      will produce the best and most abundant harvest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RULES AND PREPARATIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Naturally, you must be sure you understand any pertinent      state laws <em>before</em> going ricing, both for your own      protection and for the longterm preservation of the crop.      In Minnesota, for example, the Department of Natural      Resources shares custody of the state's wild rice stands      with the Indian Rice Committees. Of course, the native      American organizations have jurisdiction over the beds      located within reservation boundaries . . . which are some      of the most productive in the state. However, there are      thousands of fertile locations <em>outside</em> those      preserves that are available, on an equal basis, to Indian      and non-Indian alike.    </p>         <p>      The ricing season usually opens during the latter part of      August, with gathering hours set between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00      p.m. (because the grain is easiest to remove from the stalk      during the warmest part of the day). A rice harvesting      license in our state costs $4.00, and is obtainable at most      of the places that sell fishing permits.    </p>    <p>      Under Minnesota law, a canoe used when collecting the grain      can be no more than 18 feet in length and 36 inches wide.      And while it's all right to paddle the double-ender to the      harvesting ground, it must be propelled <em>through</em>      the stand with a push-pole . . . in order to avoid damaging      the stalks.    </p>    <p>      Yet another rule requires that the pole be fitted with a      forked lower end . . . which - in most cases -      is actually a pair of hinged wings that fold against each      other when the pole is pulled forward through the water,      but fan out when forced against the mucky bottom, providing      additional purchase. A lot of ricers buy commercially      produced aluminum units called "duckbills", which are      widely available in canoe shops.    </p>    <p>      Even the generally crude sticks used to knock rice off the      stalks must meet certain legal requirements, being      restricted to a length of not more than 30 inches and a      weight of no more than a pound. This regulation serves to      prevent ambitious commercial ricers from smashing their way      through a patch with a pair of baseball bats . . .      something that a few <em>would</em> surely do, were it not      for the law. Most harvesters prefer to carve their own      sticks, developing a design that performs well and fits      their hands comfortably.    </p>    <p>      Just before the harvesting season actually begins, Lil and      I check over our gear and give the interior of our canoe a      good scrubbing with a bristle brush (after all, our harvest      of grain will be <em>collected</em> on that floor). Then we      remove the craft's center thwart and carrying yoke to      provide a larger unobstructed area for the rice to fall      into. The bow and stern thwarts are left in place, however,      to maintain the boat's structural strength.    </p>    <p>      <strong>JUST A LITTLE WILD</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the many wonderful attributes of wild rice is the      fact that a little of it goes a long way: Three fourths of      a cup of dry grain will fill an entire casserole when      cooked. And while Lil has worked out a seemingly unlimited      number of recipes based on the popular comestible, most of      them begin with the same method of preparation.    </p>    <p>      To duplicate her process, use cold water to wash 3/4 cup of      rice, twice, in a large saucepan . . . then cover the grain      with about an inch of the liquid. If you intend to eat the      rice with fish or fowl, add four chicken bouillon cubes . .      . if you're aiming to serve the dish along with red meat,      drop in four beef bouillon cubes instead. Next, bring the      water in the pot to a boil, then cut back the heat and      simmer the rice, covered. In about an hour the grain will      be puffed up and tender, and ready to dish out as is . . .      or to go into any of a variety of dishes such as muffins,      bread, stuffing, casseroles, salads, puddings, and more!    </p>    <p>      <strong>"STALKING" YOUR PREY</strong>    </p>    <p>      As is the case with most jobs in life, there's definitely a      preferred technique for efficient rice harvesting. Lil and      I like to hit our first patch of the day just as the 9:00      a.m. opening hour strikes. As we drift down on the bed, I      stand up - feet braced - in the space between      the bow seat and the stem, facing the stern. My wife kneels      on a boat cushion just behind the bow seat, also facing      rearward.    </p>    <p>      Now with all of the passenger weight forward of the center      point, and the poleman standing, you might think that our      craft would be quite unstable . . . but after only a little      practice we learned to maintain an easy balance while      poling stern-first into the rice. In fact, in 16 years of      harvesting, we haven't (knock on wood) dumped yet!    </p>    <p>      It's best to enter each rice patch carefully, first noting      which way the stalks lean when blown by the wind. We've      found that we get the best results by poling the canoe      directly into the breeze on the first pass, then shifting      over a few feet and coming straight downwind on the next.      Any attempt to go crosswind through the bed of grain will      usually result in your double-ender's being blown sideways      over the stalks, forcing them down and putting most of the      rice out of reach.    </p>    <p>      As the boat's bow parts the tall grasses, Lil reaches out      over the starboard side of the canoe with one stick in her      right hand and draws a sheaf of stalks over the gunwale.      With the other stick, she knocks the kernels loose, hitting      downward in the direction that the stems are leaning and      almost sliding the top stick along the edge of the one      that's holding the stalks down. Then my partner reverses      the operation, pulling stalks over the port side and      striking them with the righthand stick. My job is to keep      our craft moving just fast enough to match the speed of her      side-to-side motion. Of course, a lot of the rice misses      the canoe and falls into the water . . . to serve as seed      for <em>next</em> year's crop.    </p>           <p>      Wild rice kernels are tipped with beards - somewhat      similar to those found on oats - so they tend to land      in the boat heavy end down and fluff up . . . with the      accumulation in the craft's bottom taking on the appearance      of a greenish brown deep-pile carpet. But this "rug" often      has an undercurrent of movement. There are usually ladybugs      parading up and down the plants, and sometimes the stalks      are infested with "rice worms" . . . the tiny white larvae      of a moth that deposits its eggs on the stems during the      summer. To any but the practiced eye, these minuscule      creatures are nearly invisible . . . under <em>most</em>      circumstances.    </p>    <p>      However, the first autumn that Lil and I riced together, we      were caught in a sudden afternoon downpour that soaked the      thick layer of grain in the bottom of our canoe. As I poled      toward the shelter of some shoreline pines, my wife      suddenly emitted a startled yelp and began shoving the      harvest away from her knees. The tiny worms, forced up      through the carpet of wild rice by the rising water in the      belly of the boat, had climbed until they surfaced . . .      turning the mat between Lil and the stern seat into a      wriggling mass of sinuate white forms. Obviously, ricing is      not for the overly squeamish.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"TAMING" YOUR HARVEST</strong>    </p>    <p>      When the legal gathering hours are over, we sweep the day's      accumulation of grain out of the canoe and bag it. Closely      woven sacks are best for this part of the operation, and      we've found that old pillowcases work fine.. Once that's      done, we head for home immediately, with the 50 to 80      pounds that constitutes our usual "take" packed securely      <em>and</em> kept in the shade. (If left in the bags too      long - several hours, say - green grain will      begin to generate warmth, then start to mold and      deteriorate.)    </p>    <p>      There are a number of ways to cure wild rice . . . but we      simply spread the grain in a six-inch layer on our basement      floor and turn it over twice a day until it's dry and      ready. Other harvesters favor curing their share of      nature's, bounty in the sun, while some ricers even claim      that exposure to a little rainfall during the drying      process improves the harvest's flavor. Everyone seems      convinced that his or her method is the best . . . but      - as far as we can see - they <em>all</em> do      the job.    </p>         <p>      Like most grains, wild rice must be threshed before it can      be prepared and eaten. My Chippewa friends tell me that the      tribe formerly did this with their feet, donning moccasins      made just for the purpose and treading on the crop while it      lay in a shallow hole lined with moose hide. After the      hulls were stamped loose, the grain was winnowed . . . a      process which involved shaking it on a blanket or in a      shallow basket and allowing the wind to carry the chaff      away. A few folks still thresh their rice by hand, but most      of us simply take the cured crop to one of the many      commercial processors in the area. The pros will do the job      in minutes for about 30 cents a pound . . . and, besides      removing the hulls, many will clean and grade the harvest      by machine, returning it divided into three lots: large      grain, small grain, and broken pieces. (All are equally      good to eat, but the bigger kernels do have the best      appearance and are generally considered the choicest.)    </p>    <p>      Wild rice will often lose as much as 40% to 50% of its      weight during processing, mostly in the form of water      driven of by heat. Therefore, we usually wind up with about      half the number of pounds we brought ashore in our canoe .      . . though in good years, when the quality of the harvest      is high, we might get as much as a 60% return.    </p>    <p>      As far as Lil and I can tell, the shelf life of wild rice      is little short of unlimited . . . we actually know folks      who've kept the delicacy in containers for up to ten years      without deterioration or flavor loss. We don't manage to      keep it that long, though! Out of our annual average of 100      pounds of finished grain, half goes into Christmas gift      packages and the rest into our pantry. By the following      fall the <em>prior</em> year's harvest is usually only a      fond memory.    </p>
