                        <p>      As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.<br />      <br />      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over      again.</em><br />      <br />      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses/, and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em><br />      <br />      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28791. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered here-and      here only-where we all can read what the Nearings have to      say.</em><br />      <br />      The two of you-through your writing and public      appearances-have had a profound effect on many people in      the "outside world". However, most homesteaders don't live      your sort of dual lifestyle. Do you feel that people who      work solely toward their own self-sufficiency are really      turning their backs on the serious moral issues of the day      and, instead of speaking out, are "sticking their heads in      organic soil"?<br />      <br />      In our opinion, homesteaders do not necessarily "cop out"      when they turn to country life. Many such people find that      rural living can leave them with enough free time and      energy to engage in worthwhile social and political      activities. The fact of the matter is that men and women      who are willing to work for serious moral issues will do      so, regardless of where or how they live . . . while those      who do not share such concerns will avoid the Issues and      pursue their own pleasures, whether they live in a large      city or on a backwoods farm.<br />      <br />      I recently sold my country house-in which I'd lived alone      for three years-and returned to San Francisco . . . a place      where my heart most definitely is not! It seems that my      often enjoyable and always challenging experiences with      rural life have soured me on "civilization".<br />      <br />      I must also admit, however, that I sometimes found living      alone in the country to be painful. My neighbors were all      firmly established in their own family units . . .      and-through no unkindness-weren't able to offer much      companionship to an unattached individual.<br />      <br />      Therefore, though I want very much to lead a      self-sufficient life, I know that I don't want to try to do      so by myself again! Where and how might a person look to      meet potential spouses/partners who share the homesteading      dream?<br />      <br />      Under the best of circumstances, a solitary life leaves      much to be desired (although there are, of course,      advantages -as well as disadvantages-to every situation).      We would most certainly advise against trying to homestead      alone . . . since we feel it would be next to impossible      for a single person to deal with the many problems that      come up in the day-to-day course of rural existence.<br />      <br />      Keep on looking for the partner you need. (Have you tried      reading through the "Positions and Situations" section in      this magazine?)<br />      <br />      I have a friend who eats fragments of eggshell (not the      entire shell, but a few chips) every time he dines on an      egg. Furthermore, when he eats fruits or vegetables, he      routinely consumes the skins, seeds, and all (he does not,      however, eat apple seeds . . . since he considers them to      be toxic). My associate also munches on grass from his      lawn. (He claims that it is an exceptionally good source of      vitamin C, and goes on to assert that it is safe to eat      almost all green or yellow flowers and grasses.) In your      opinion, are such dietary practices healthful or      harmful?<br />      <br />      Being vegetarians, Scott and I don't eat eggs . . and      therefore don't consume eggshells. We do, however, prefer      to eat our fruits and vegetables with the skins on (except      for such thick-peeled varieties as bananas, oranges, and      avocados). We have also eaten grass and made it into a      vitamin-rich juice, although we don't recommend the      indiscriminate eating of green and yellow flowers and      grasses: After all, buttercups are yellow, and quite      poisonous.<br />      <br />      Your friend does sound just a little odd . . . but then,      aren't we all?<br />      <br />      I have a question about mulching that I hope you can answer      for me. Gardener Ruth Stout claims (or so I've been told)      that she hasn't plowed, weeded, or fertilized her gardens      in nearly 14 years! As I understand it, her method involves      simply covering the plot with straw mulch, then planting,      picking, and canning!<br />      <br />      Do you folks employ a similar technique? I'd appreciate      your sharing your views on the advantages or disadvantages      of year-round mulching. I'd been under the impression that      it's best to turn mulch under to help aerate the soil . . .      but am now wondering if the extra work involved is really      necessary.<br />      I don't usually get excited about gardening, because of all      the labor involved. Ms. Stout seems to have taken most of      the work out of growing crops, though . . . which means      that I might be able to have a garden and enough spare time      to do what I enjoy most . . . go fishing!<br />      <br />      Ruth Stout learned her mulch-gardening method from Scott,      who first told her about the No-Diggers Association in      England (to which he had belonged for decades).      Furthermore, toe haven't plowed our garden plot for 26      years. Our work does involve turning over the soil-using a      hand cultivator-after every rain or watering, however. This      practice effectively eliminates unwanted plant growth      between the rows, killing the weeds while they're still      small.<br />      <br />      Ruth Stout spreads her garbage on the surface of her      gardens, while Scott and I compost ours-with seaweed-before      applying it to the beds as a mulch . . . and we do think      that the extra work of composting and hand cultivating is      rewarded by extra garden neatness and efficiency.<br />      <br />      We feel that going fishing is a real waste of your time,      however, and that such "sport" is cruel. Why not spend the      same hours on a productive garden?<br />      <br />      My husband and I, and our three children, have homesteaded      for the past ten years and managed to make a success of it.      However, despite the fact that we live in a lovely area,      there are times when I feel a strong desire to get away and      experience other places. My husband, on the other hand, is      perfectly happy staying where we are . . . and has no      interest in spending any of our hard-earned money on a      "frivolous vacation".<br />      <br />      I realize that your lectures take you away from your home      on occasion, and thus offer you a change of scene. I think      that travel can be very valuable, even if it serves to do      nothing more than make one appreciate his or her home.      Would you share your opinion on this matter?<br />      <br />      I can't say that either of us really ever feels a need to      take a vacation, but-when we do travel to speak or conduct      research-we certainly enjoy the varied surroundings and      experiences that are thus made available to us. We rarely      take "frivolous vacations", of course. When we leave home,      it's to do a job and then return as quickly as      possible.<br />      <br />      Naturally, if we ever had to choose between being eternally      banned from the city or forever removed from country life,      we would vastly prefer exile from the city.    </p>
