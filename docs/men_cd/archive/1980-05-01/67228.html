               <p>      You can forage up some free and tasty meals, using Paul      Fleisher's primer on . . .    </p>            <p>      The Atlantic coast of the United States-from Cape Cod      south to Florida-is graced with one of the world's      most delicious seafoods: the blue crab ( <em>Callinectes      sapidus</em> ). In my home state of Virginia, the "blue" is      widely appreciated ... yet I'm constantly surprised at the      number of people (both here and elsewhere) who've sive      stance with pincers raised. And when novices ask me how to      approach this delicate task, I always tell them . . .      <em>carefully!</em><br />      <br />      For safety's sake, you should pick crabs up from behind . .      . with your thumb and first two fingers placed clear of      those clashing claws. Another workable method is to hold      the crustaceans by the never caught, cooked, or eaten the      easily gathered delicacy.<br />      <br />      Fortunately, the aggressive crustaceans are so abundant      (especially through the middle Atlantic and southern      states) that I don't feel too concerned about encouraging      more people to take advantage of them. Furthermore, few      creatures are better equipped for survival. Crabs can swim      efficiently and crawl rapidly . . . have keen, 360Â°      eyesight ... and, as you know, are blessed (from their      point of view, if not from ours) with an imposing pair of      powerful claws. Such characteristics make catching the      feisty little fellows interesting ... and sometimes even      downright exciting.<br />      <br />      No license is required to take crabs, although there are      restrictions on both the legal size and bag limit. In      Virginia, for example, it's illegal to keep more than one      bushel per day (which is certainly an ample haul), and the      law protects crablings smaller than 4-3/4" across the      widest part of the back shell ... critters which don't have      enough meat to bother with anyway. (Regulations in other      states may vary, so be sure to check before you      catch.)<br />      <br />      <strong>HOW TO BAG THEM</strong><br />      <br />      The blue crabs' favorite feeding grounds are salt marshes.      Swimming into such areas with the tide, the crustaceans      feast on the rich animal life which thrives there.      Consequently, the best time and place to go crabbing is on      a rising tide in an area well supplied with marshland.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: It's a sad sign of our times, but you      should always call your local health department to check      out the purity of the water in your chosen foraging      grounds.]</em><br />      <br />      Crabs come in from deeper waters when the ocean warms in      the late spring, and remain available until fall ... when      colder weather drives them back into deep ocean dormancy      again. (In the far South, however, they can be      found-albeit in limited numbers-prowling in the      shallows throughout much of the winter.)<br />      <br />      During the warm water season, though, crabbing is never the      "sometimes" proposition that fin fishing is. If the tide is      right and you've located a good spot, there's no need to      worry about whether or not they'll be biting on a given      day. <em>They will be.</em><br />      <br />      The most common (noncommercial) means of catching crabs is      to use a chicken neck, a fish head, or a chunk of salt pork      tied on a string and weighted with a lead sinker or rock.      Drop the baited line into the water, and soon you should      feel a gentle tugging. Watch out, though, because-if      the line isn't secured or carefully - observed-your      quarry may quietly make off with the entire rig.<br />      <br />      When a crab has latched onto the bait, carefully retrieve      the line until the tasty crustacean is just below the      surface of the water. If you pull it out into the air, the      startled creature will almost always release its meal and      escape. To avoid such losses, slide a long-handled net into      the water below the bait and scoop up your catch. (I prefer      to use a net made of stiff wire mesh, since a crab can get      amazingly tangled in the more common twine variety ... and      disengaging the struggling shellfish from a cotton web      while avoiding painful nips requires too much      patience.)<br />      <br />      <strong>OTHER METHODS</strong><br />      <br />      There are several other ways for an amateur crabber to      catch his dinner. Many sporting goods stores and bait shops      sell inexpensive ring nets, which are strung around two      concentric wire rings, the larger of which is usually one      and a half feet in diameter. Weighted and baited in the      center, these snares lie flat on the marsh bottom so the      crabs can enter. When one is lifted from the water, the      outer ring forms a circular wall of netting that prevents      the agile arthropods from escaping. Ring nets can even be      made at home with little difficulty. (Crab traps, which are      wire mesh boxes with sides that fold up when lifted, are      also available but are somewhat more expensive than the      simpler nets.)<br />      <br />      When using ring nets and traps, you can catch two or more      of the clawed brutes at a time, and fewer crabs will be      lost. Such snares can also be used from docks and bridges      that are too high above the water for dip-netting.<br />      <br />      The most sporting way to catch crabs, however, is to stalk      them in their own territory with a long-handled net. Just      walk along the shallows or through the creek and salt-marsh      thoroughfares while keeping a sharp eye out for the      well-camouflaged crustaceans. A quick set of reflexes is an      asset in this form of crabbing, because the shy sea      creatures will scuttle away quickly when they sense your      presence. This kind of foraging will also occasionally net      you an' extra dividend: a soft-shelled crab . . . which is      a blue that has just molted and its new shell hasn't yet      hardened. (The little "softies" are truly a delicious      treat!<br />      <br />      <strong>A CONTACT SPORT</strong><br />      <br />      First-time crab foragers often hesitate to pick up an      escaping crustacean as it dashes toward freedom or takes a      defen "elbows" just behind the powerful pincers. (The      disadvantage to this technique is that two hands are      required.) If you're really nervous about getting nipped,      it's best to simply wear heavy gloves or bring along a pair      of kitchen tongs.<br />      <br />      Once a crab is caught, drop it into a cooler filled with      ice or place it in a wet burlap sack. The idea is to keep      your prospective dinner moist, cool, and alive until you're      ready to cook it. (Crabs put in a bucket of still water      will quickly suffocate as the liquid loses its      oxygen.)<br />      <br />      Incidentally, the "angling" methods that I've described      will work on other crab varieties as well. The waters of      northern New England and the Pacific coast don't have the      blue crab, but they do host some species ... although      they're usually not as abundant as southeastern blues, or      as aggressive at taking bait. Still, since few people take      advantage of the crabbing opportunities in such areas, I've      caught a good number of local delicacies (like rock and      green crabs) using ring nets.<br />      <br />      <strong>HOW TO COOK THEM</strong><br />      <br />      Once you've bagged a bunch of crabs, you'll want to cook      them up right away. To steam any variety of hard-shelled      crab, put about an inch of water in the bottom of a large      pot and add a few ounces of vinegar, along with a couple of      tablespoons of "crab boil" spice (such as Old Bay Seafood      Seasoning, available in many grocery stores). Bring the      water to a boil and drop the live crabs in upside down, so      that the spices will permeate the meat. Finally, sprinkle      some more spice on the top of the last layer, cover the      pot, and let it steam for about 10 minutes. As they cook,      the crabs may squirm briefly . . . but the boiling water      and steam will kill them quickly. Once the shells turn a      brick red, your dinner is ready.<br />      <br />      To prepare soft-shelled crabs, use a sharp knife to cut out      the eyestalks, then-with the crab on its      back-make a small cut just below the mouth and remove      the stomach ... a gelatinous, coiled mass. Next, make two      more slits along the sides . . . fold back the soft, new      shell . .. and cut away the spongy, grayish gills      (otherwise known as "dead man's fingers"). The rest of the      crab is edible, shell and all, and the best and easiest way      to cook softies is to saute them in melted butter until      they're brown on both sides. (Soft-shells can also be      breaded and deep-fried.)<br />      <br />      <strong>HOW TO EAT THEM</strong><br />      <br />      Many people are puzzled the first time they're served a      steamed, hard-shelled crab: They know there's meat in      there, but don't know exactly how to get at it (and lose a      lot of the tasty morsels in their attempts). So here's a      step-by-step description of the proper way to      proceed.<br />      <br />      First, cover the table with newspaper and supply it      generously with napkins, bowls for empty shells, and plenty      to drink. Serve the crustaceans right up in the cooking      pot-if you like-because a crab feast is far too      messy for ceremony.<br />      <br />      Now, crack the claws with a mallet or a nutcracker and      extract the meat. (A nutpick is sometimes useful for the      latter task.)<br />      <br />      Next, break off the walking and swimming legs where they      join the body and suck out whatever meat and juice is in      them. (There usually isn't enough inside to justify      breaking them open.) Then turn the crab upside down and      remove the "key", a flap attached at the rear of the shell      and extending forward, flat against the abdomen. (Males      have long, pointed keys, while females have broad,      triangular flaps known as "aprons".) Set the crusty seafood      delicacy right side up again ... slip a finger under the      top shell at the crustacean's rear . . . and pry it off to      reveal the insides.<br />      <br />      That done, remove and discard the white coiled stomach and      the dead man's fingers. You'll also see a yellowish or      greenish substance which is known as "mustard". This is the      crab's liver, and it's quite tasty.<br />      <br />      In order to get to the rest of the meat, break the      remaining portion of the crab in half lengthwise. Where the      rear swimming legs were attached, you'll find the "back fin      lump", the largest and sweetest chunk of seafood anywhere.      (Of course, there're dozens of other little chitinous      compartments filled with succulent bits which can be      extracted with your fingers or a nutpick.)<br />      <br />      When you've picked the crustacean clean, wipe your hands      and face . . . take a long drink of cold beer or white wine      to quench the spicy burning in your mouth . . . and start      all over again!    </p>
