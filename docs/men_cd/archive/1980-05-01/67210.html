            		<p>		<em>Your whole family can join in collecting    high-quality-and salable-bait for free.</em>		</p>        <h5 id="byline">      JOHN E. PHILLIPS    </h5>    		    		     <p>      The cost of live bait-which has risen along with the      price of most everything else in the past few      years-can really put a crimp in a family fishing      expedition. However, there is an almost sure-fire way to      gather your own "fish attracters" . . . using a traditional      skill that has been lost in much of the United States but      is still alive in parts of northern Alabama. The art is      "worm fiddling", and it's practiced nowadays by residents      of the mountainous region of Blount County .. . like      William (Bubba) Childers, who first learned how to fiddle      for worms on fishin' expeditions with his granddaddy.<br />      <br />      In just ten minutes, says Bubba, you can gather a whole      bucketful of fiddle worms . . . with no more equipment than      a rusty handsaw that's missing a few teeth and an old pail.      It's best to go worming in the spring, advises our master      bait-catcher . . . but you can actually capture the      crawlers any time of the year, as long as the ground isn't      frozen.<br />      <br />      <strong>FINDING A PLACE TO FIDDLE</strong><br />      <br />      A crucial factor in finding a good site to "play up" the      critters is the amount of moisture in the soil. Fiddle      worms like damp earth, so in dry weather they move down      into the lowlands in search of water. After a rain,      however, you might look for your bait on the side of a      hill. (Bubba reports that he once roused 300 worms in less      than 15 minutes by fiddling at a point just above an      underground stream!)<br />      <br />      When you've located an area of wet ground, look for the      small, round casings that the worms discharge as they work      through the soil. Such excretions are usually found among      decaying leaves at the base of a young tree ... which is      handy, as an available sapling is absolutely essential to      the "fiddlin' " technique. (The area around a beech tree is      often especially productive because, as the Alabama      "musician" explains, "For some reason fiddle worms love to      munch on rotting beech leaves.")<br />      <br />      The sapling you choose should be about three inches in      diameter, which-in most tree species-is large      enough to have produced an extensive root system. To make      your "fiddlin' stage", just saw down the tree . . . leaving      about 12 to 18 inches of stump above the ground. (Needless      to say, such an operation should only be performed in your      own woodlot!)<br />      <br />      <strong>HERE COME THE WORMS!</strong><br />      <br />      Now-using a dull saw-"fiddle" away ... by      simply dragging the cutting tool back 'n' forth across the      top of the stump. The vibrations travel through the tree's      root network, sending tremors into the earth . . . and the      worms are literally jolted to the surface! If the ground is      damp, you'll start seeing wigglers in two to five minutes,      but-if the soil lacks moisture it'll take a bit      longer. You should fiddle in one place for at least ten      minutes before giving up and changing sites . . . just keep      a-sawin' and usually the crawlers will appear, sometimes as      far as 25-30 feet away from the stump. Fiddle worms average      between 12 and 15 inches in length, but some may reach as      much as two feet long . . . so you can't miss them as they      turn up in the soil.<br />      <br />      After the worms begin to surface, collect them in a      five-gallon bucket. Your pail should have a drainage hole      in the bottom (so excess water won't drown the bait), and      should be filled with woods dirt. Fiddle worms love the      decayed leaves in forest soil, and they'll survive in their      bucket home for at least a month. (You should, however,      keep them watered . . . and don't forget to throw a little      cornmeal or chicken feed on them every week or two.)<br />      <br />      <strong>LET'S TRY ANOTHER WAY</strong><br />      <br />      If you can't find a worn-out saw, there are other methods      of fiddling for bait. The "McCullough      Technique"-which requires using a chain      saw-demands much less effort than does "hand fiddlin'      ", and usually results in full buckets. Simply crank up the      engine and-with the chain removed or      disengaged-hold the instrument against the ground (as      shown in the photo) while it runs. The vibrations will      bring up the worms, just as the "tune" of the handsaw      does.<br />      <br />      Another method (the "Cave Man Technique") also requires an      18-inch-high tree stump. But-instead of sawing on the      trunk-"Neanderthal wormers" simply pound on the wood      with a large rock. This technique is a simple one, but it      does in volve a lot more elbow grease than the other      methods. ("If I were goin' to do that much work to get      fiddle worms, I believe I'd just go out and buy 'em,"      laughs Bubba.)<br />      <br />      <strong>SELLING THE LEFTOVERS</strong><br />      <br />      Whatever system you employ, you'll probably harvest lots      more worms than you need . . . and you can make a handsome      profit by marketing your surplus at local fish camps and      tackle shops. Fiddies-which make excellent bait for      catfish, bass, bream, and trout-are especially      valuable because of their length: One worm, broken apart,      will easily adorn several hooks, and the pieces are tough      enough to stay securely in place.<br />      <br />      To package the bait for sale, you'll need either a number      of 16-ounce styrofoam cups (put about 25 worms in each one)      or-for large orders-12"-square boxes (which      should hold 500 to 1,000 wigglers apiece). You can collect      either kind of packaging yourself, or order it in bulk from      container suppliers.<br />      <br />      At seven  cents per worm, one cup of the crawlers should      sell for about $1.75. And, since you can usually gather      300-400 worms in just two or three hours' work, that's a      possible income of about $10 an hour . . . which isn't bad      for a "mountain fiddler"!<br />      <br />      <strong>THE FAMILY THAT</strong> <strong>FIDDLES TOGETHER .      . .</strong><br />      <br />      An afternoon's worming expedition can be not only      profitable, but also just plain fun for the entire family .      . . it's sort of like an old-fashioned Easter egg hunt, as      the young'uns eagerly collect the crawlers.<br />      <br />      But Bubba reminds us that some precautions should be taken      whenever you set off in search of fiddle worms. Before you      leave, clothe everybody against insect bites . . . and, of      course, keep a sharp eye out for poison oak and ivy while      you're in the woods.<br />      <br />      And one more thing: Make sure that everyone on the outing      is supplied with his or her own pail, because when the      wiggling critters begin to pop up in all different      directions around the tree stump, you don't want to be      caught with only one bucket among you!    </p>
