                    <p>      <strong>SHADES OF DR. STRANGELOVE:</strong> When an      interviewer asked Republican candidate George Bush how he      thought a nuclear exchange could be won, he replied: "You      have a survivability of command in control, survivability      of industrial potential, protection of a percentage of your      citizens... and you have a capability that inflicts more      damage on the opposition than it can inflict on you..." "Do      you mean that five percent would survive? Two percent?" he      was questioned. "More than that... if everybody fired      everything he had, you'd have more than that survive."    </p>    <p>      <strong>GREED</strong> (Get Rich Exploiting the Earth's      Development) is a tongue-in-cheek organization formed by      some Montana environmentalists in answer to a      pro-development group called NEED (Northwest Energy,      Employment, and Development). Among GREED's proposals is a      1,200-foot tall, stainless steel dam, and the phony firm's      motto is: "If people weren't meant to take all they could      get, God wouldn't have given them two good hands to grab it      with."    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANOTHER REASON TO GO WHOLISTIC:</strong> Each year,      Americans use 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (which      amounts to 40% of our total production of the fuel) to      manufacture 30 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer... for      which U.S. farmers will pay $6 billion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A MASSIVE LAND GRAB :</strong> The deployment of      the proposed MX missile system would require 3 to 12      million acres (an area as much as four times the size of      Connecticut), and the spots chosen-besides becoming      potential nuclear wastelands in case of attack-would face      lowered water tables, the displacement of inhabitants for      "security" purposes, and the possibility of accidents      involving nuclear materials and rocket propellants. Sites      in Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming,      Utah, Montana, Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado have been      under consideration.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ON TOP OF THAT,</strong> our nuclear counterforce      systems are now being fully automated, so that an atomic      attack could-perhaps-be launched simply by computer error.      (On November 9, 1979 the North American Defense Command      computer in Colorado Springs sent out such a false attack      alert... and a number of planes were in the air before the      error was discovered.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>OLD-FASHIONED FARMING:</strong> According to      African Development Group's P. Jay Fetner, what the Third      World needs from the U.S. is information provided by      "family" farmers who are willing to roll up their sleeves      and get down to business on a long-term basis. "All the      technology in the world won't help," he says. "U.S.      Agribusiness needs to go back to its own roots."    </p>    <p>      <strong>PUBLISHERS EXCHANGE,</strong> a new periodicals      promotion company, will send you sample copies of over 138      publications-covering a wide range of interests-for      50 cents per copy. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope      to Publishers Exchange, Dept. TMEN, Box 1368P, Plainfield,      New Jersey 07061 for a list.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN OMEN?In Madrid,</strong> Spain's Incarnation      Monastery a stain which is said to be the blood of a      fourth-century martyr, Saint Pantaleon, did not coagulate      after it became liquid (as it reportedly does each year)      last July 27. According to monastery records, the same      phenomenon occurred just before the outbreaks of World War      I, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ON A GLOBAL BASIS,</strong> nations now invest an      average of $16,000 a year per soldier, and $260 a year in      the education of a school-age child. In the U.S., the      figures are, respectively, $43,600 and $1,675.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INVOLUNTARY BIRTH CONTROL?</strong> Because of the      chemical contamination present-in work places, air, water,      food, and even clothing-Dr. Joseph McFalls, Jr. of      Temple University concludes that the proportion of couples      in industrialized nations who cannot bear children will      probably increase. Already, 40% of American women are      subfecund... a term used to describe a level of      reproductive ability which is less than normal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A LESS PAINFUL RABIES SHOT,</strong> which can be      injected into the arm rather than the stomach, may be on      the market before the end of the year... with a series of      only five injections needed, instead of the 14 to 21 shots      required for the old serum to be effective.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE USE OF CHEMICAL PESTICIDES      ON RICE CROPS,</strong> the Chinese now control harmful      insects with spiders, in a ratio of approximately one      spider to 20 pests. This method has "increased rice yield      without increasing expenses" .... The U.S. Forest Service      is promoting a 1980 "PLANT A BIRTHDAY TREE" campaign to      encourage people to use such "living memorials" to      commemorate special anniversaries .... ACID RAIN ATE THE      PAINT OFF MORE THAN 200 CARS in the Harrisburg,      Pennsylvania area in just one seven-day period .... In New      York, you're FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE BITTEN BY A HUMAN      THAN BY A RAT , and residents of Brooklyn's Fort Green      section bite each other more than five times as often as      New Yorkers in general.... The U.S. Department of Labor      estimates that approximately 84,000 AMERICAN TEXTILE      WORKERS suffer from "brown lung" as a result of inhaling      cotton dust .... In Rangoon, Burma EXPERIMENTS ON 30 DRUG      ADDICTS-USING ACUPUNCTURE on arms, ears, and knees-proved      more successful than other treatments, including use of the      addictive substance methadone.    </p>
