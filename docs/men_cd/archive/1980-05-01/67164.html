                <p>      Actor Eddie Albert, long a champion of ecological causes,      recently gave a speech-at a tree-planting      ceremony-on topsoil and erosion. In the following      excerpts, he points out just how dangerous a game we are      playing with the razor-thin skin of earth that stands      between us and total disaster.    </p>    <h1 id=" title">      CIVILIZATION RETS ON TOPSOIL    </h1>        <p>      Every morsel of food we eat . . . our clothes . . . our      houses and most everything that's in them . . . each scrap      of paper, from birth certificates to books to dollars . . .      our fuel . . . even the very oxygen we breath: All of it      comes from plants, trees . . . and topsoil.<br />      <br />      When our European ancestors arrived on this continent, our      topsoil averaged around 18 inches in depth. With our      intensive agricultural practices, we've eroded it to around      eight inches . . . that's all that's left between us and      world disaster. When that eight inches goes, you and I      go.<br />      <br />      <strong>A DISASTER CALLED MAN</strong><br />      <br />      There are innumerable examples of civilizations which have      already traveled this route. Trees were always the first to      go. As the local populations grew, timber was needed for      warmth, cooking, housing, and lime burning. Solomon cut the      famous cedars of Lebanon for his great temples. Rome      deforested southern Europe from Spain to Palestine. The      whole of North Africa was cleared to plant more wheat for      the expanding Roman population . . . and replanting was      unheard of.<br />      <br />      When the trees were gone, the topsoil-exposed to rain,      wind, and sun-lost its organic matter, its humus, its soil      life . . . the spongy quality that gives the earth its      ability to hold water through droughts. The soil dried out      and became dead dust. The next wind blew it away, or the      next rain washed it down the river . . . and the earth      died. The climate changed as the rain cycle slowed down as      a result of deforestation. The wild grass that came up was      soon demolished by hungry goats, roots and all . . . and      the once glorious lands of trees, lakes, rivers, cities,      palaces, universities, families, artists-millions upon      millions of healthy, creating, achieving people-quietly      blew away. Splendid civilizations collapsed and are now      visible only as footnotes in the history books or a few      fragments of pots on a museum shelf.<br />      <br />      The cycle is always the same: Man comes . . . the trees go      . . . the topsoil goes . . . the desert comes. We are      following that path.<br />      <br />      <strong>CENTURIES LOST IN AN HOUR</strong><br />      <br />      It takes centuries of the weathering of rocks to grow an      inch of topsoil, and thousands-even millions-of years to      create a deep, fertile layer. But on shallow, sloping      hillsides one great rainstorm can gash and gully a slope      down to bare rock in an hour. When nature's protecting      cover of plants and trees is cut down-or the carpet of      grass with its interlocking roots is sliced open by the      plow-the destroying power of rain or wind is multiplied a      thousand times.<br />      <br />      We Americans are destroying our earth many times faster      than any people who ever lived. Man, deforestation, soil      erosion, abandonment . . . that's the cycle, Another word      inevitably follows: famine.<br />      <br />      Our population explosion is at the heart of the problem. We      can't increase food production as fast as the world      population increases. There are three new mouths to feed      each second . . . 230,000 new mouths to feed each day. But      with each passing day we have less land to work with. To      meet this growing demand, farmers are forced to put      unbearable pressure on the soil . . . pressure it's unable      to sustain.<br />      <br />      In the past 30 or 40 years, the heavy use of synthetic      fertilizers, anhydrous ammonia, nitrates, pesticides and      herbicides, DDT, etc. have doubled and tripled the yield of      grain per acre . . . but at the expense of the organic      matter in the soil.<br />      <br />      Rotation of crops has been replaced with monoculture: corn,      corn, corn, or wheat, wheat, wheat. Everyone knows this      method exhausts the soil and increases pest infestation,      but people are hungry and the cash register is jingling.      Yet for every bushel of corn we harvest, we lose two      bushels of topsoil.<br />      <br />      The practice of allowing the fields to lie fallow for a      season, to rest, to restore the erosion-slowing organic      matter, is also disappearing. Terracing and contour      plowing, both of which are water-holding and      erosion-preventing practices, are being dropped. The big      new machines, you see, are too wide for terracing.<br />      <br />      <strong>LIVING ON THE MARGIN</strong><br />      <br />      Then, too, because of the current high price of grain,      there has been an appalling rush to put under cultivation      millions of acres of the wrong terrain-marginal land, we      call it-and farm it in the worst, non-conservative way      possible. By marginal land we mean grassland, for example,      meant only for grazing stock . . . or sloping land . . . or      land with too little rainfall, requiring heavy      irrigation.<br />      <br />      On May 11, 1934, 350 million tons of Oklahoma's tired      marginal topsoil, hit by a duster, exploded in huge clouds      up into the transcontinental jet stream. Ships 300 miles      out at sea were covered with Oklahoma. Twelve million tons      hit Chicago alone. In Washington, D.C. dust particles      seeped in through the windows and settled on Congressional      desks. This disaster, the result of cultivating marginal      land, took-in one day the equivalent of 3,500 hundred-acre      farms out of food production.<br />      <br />      As a result, the government ordered millions of trees to be      planted-green belts that would slow down the eroding wind      and protect the topsoil-and for nearly 40 years the trees      did their job. However, when the high grain prices hit in      1973, the Secretary of Agriculture ordered the green belt      cut down. "Plant fencerow to fencerow," he said.<br />      <br />      Between '73 and '74, 51 million acres were taken out of the      federally subsidized soil bank program and converted to      cropland without soil preparation or good conservation      practices. Soil losses from <em>50 to 200</em> tons per      acre resulted. Now much of the land is even ruined for      grazing cattle. It will take 25 years to restore the green      belts, and in many areas all the topsoil will be blown away      in that time.<br />      <br />      Three or four years ago, we added around nine million more      acres of marginal land, but less than half was put under      good conservation practices. The following year we lost,      through the resulting erosion, 60 million tons of rich,      vital topsoil . . . gone forever. <em>Sixty million      tons!</em> Can you calculate how many starving children      could live off that?<br />      <br />      <strong>AN OVERDRAWN ACCOUNT</strong><br />      <br />      Each day we're losing 30 hundred-acre farms down the river      . . . 10,000 farms a year . . . 15 tons of topsoil a second      . . . a yearly loss of one ton for each person on      earth.<br />      <br />      We in America have lost about one-third of our arable land      since we arrived here. At the rate we're going, we'll lose      another third in the next dozen or so years, while the      population almost doubles. Today, each acre feeds barely      one person. At the turn of the century, 20 years from      now-with the loss of acreage and our increased      population-not one, but three people will be trying to eat      off each acre that's left.<br />      <br />      There are moments in the history of the world when a new      time begins. Usually it's during a period of desperate      crises. We are at such a moment of great change in our      history, and we must be aware of it. We have a choice. We      can stand off, let history repeat itself, and watch the      death of our hard-earned country . . . or we can pull      ourselves together, go into action, and solve the problems      of food and soil. We have the know-how, the technology. We      need discipline and courage, both good American words, but      we also need a new awareness and greater vision.<br />      <br />      Our task is . . . to rebuild the earth.    </p>
