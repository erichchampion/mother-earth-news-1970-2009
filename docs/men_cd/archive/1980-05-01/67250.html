                <p>      This fresh fish delicacy is delightful as an appetizer,      entree, or snack.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by CATHY REED    </h5>        <p>      I was introduced to ceviche (it's pronounced      "say-vee-chay") while on a scuba diving expedition off the      Caribbean coast of Mexico. We were out at sea on a Mexican      fishing boat and-when a member of our party speared a      large mackerel-the capitan hastened to prepare a      lunch.<br />      <br />      Using a very sharp knife, he skinned and filleted the fish,      chopped it into chunks, placed the pieces in a bowl, and      squeezed a number of little limes over them. Then he      produced tomatoes, onions, "chiles" (actually hot      jalape√±o peppers), and a bunch of fresh      <em>cilantro</em> (a popular Mexican herb, not unlike      coriander or parsley). These, too, were chopped up and      added to the fish . . . along with salt, pepper, and olive      oil.<br />      <br />      We took off our scuba gear and sat down to a memorable meal      of ceviche and crackers.<br />      <br />      The captain's recipe is standard all over Mexico and      remains my favorite . . . just as mackerel is still my      preferred fish for the dish. However, the possible      variations on the basic formula are endless ... and every      ceviche fan seems to have his or her own special version,      each one as tasty as the next.<br />      <br />      Actually, any white fish-either fresh or      saltwater-can be used. Traditionally, Mexicans prefer      "fatty" seafood, such as mackerel and pompano. Some cooks,      though, like the more delicate sole, while others go for      striped bass or red snapper. But-no matter what kind      of finny creature you choose-ceviche is always at its      best when the fish is <em>freshly</em> caught.<br />      <br />      Once your main ingredient is in hand ... skin the fish,      fillet it, and cut it into chunks. (Though some cooks use      large pieces, I prefer small cubes of half an inch or      less.) Like the capitan, I happen to especially favor the      tanginess of lime juice as a marinade, but you may also try      lemon juice .. . half lime and half lemon ... or a mixture      of lime, lemon, and orange. But here again, use only      freshly squeezed juice, as the bottled kind is simply      inadequate for the job.<br />      <br />      Ceviche recipes vary as to the suggested marinating      time-they run the gamut from 30 minutes to 12      hours-but I find half an hour to be plenty for any      kind of fresh fish. That's because the fruit juice's citric      acid "cooks" the fish (by the dish's looks and taste, you'd      never know the meat was raw) and long marination softens it      too much . . . I enjoy fish with a firmer texture.<br />      <br />      After the dish has marinated, you may either keep or drain      off the liquid, depending on whether you prefer "wet" or      "dry" ceviche.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE BASIC RECIPE</strong><br />      <br />      Here's how to make the type of ceviche that's most often      served in Mexican restaurants . . . usually as an      appetizer:<br />      <br />      Cut 1 pound of white-fleshed fish into half-inch      cubes and squeeze the juice of six limes over them. Set the      dish aside, and-while it marinates-chop 1      Bermuda onion, 3 tomatoes, and 2 jalapeno peppers (they're      hot!) very fine. Add theseplus 1/4 cup of olive or salad      oil, 4 tablespoons of fresh <em>cilantro</em> or parsley,      and salt and pepper to taste-to the fish, and let it      stand for 10 minutes.<br />      <br />      <strong>SPICY CEVICHE</strong><br />      <br />      For a tangy and piquant appetizer to be served with      crackers (it's ideal for a margarita party!), prepare your      fish as usual and marinate it in lime juice. Meanwhile,      make this mixture:<br />      <br />      Place 3 tomatoes, 2 Bermuda onions, 1 green pepper, and 2      jalapeno peppers-all chopped very fine-into a bowl.      Add 1/2 cup of halved green olives . . . 1/4 cup of olive      oil . . . 1/2 teaspoon each of oregano, basil, and thyme .      . . 1 bay leaf . . . 4 tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley      or cilantro ... 1/2 teaspoon of Tabasco ... 1 squeezed      clove of garlic ... 1/4 cup of tomato ketchup . . . and      salt and pepper.<br />      <br />      When that's done, drain the fish and add the spicy mixture,      letting the treat stand for at least 10 minutes before you      serve it.<br />      <br />      <strong>CARROT CEVICHE</strong><br />      <br />      This recipe produces a truly unique main dish or salad. Cut      1 pound of fish into fillets and marinate them for 1/2 hour      in the juice of 6 limes. Then drain the slices of fish, pat      them dry with paper towels, chop them very fine, and drain      them on paper towels again.<br />      <br />      At that point, place the fish in a bowl and add 1 large      Bermuda onion and 1 jalapeno pepper-both chopped very      fineplus 2 large, finely grated carrots. Next, mix in 1/2      teaspoon of oregano, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and 2      tablespoons of parsley.<br />      <br />      <strong>COCONUT CEVICHE</strong><br />      <br />      Finally, for a touch of the exotic, cut 1 pound of fish      into half-inch cubes and marinate them in the juice of 6      limes (or 3 limes and 3 oranges). After 1/2 hour, drain off      the liquid and add the milk and finely grated meat of one      small coconut, 1 clove of crushed garlic, salt, and white      pepper. Serve the dish in a coconut shell garnished with      orange slices and flowers.<br />      <br />      I'm sure you'll find ceviche-whether served as a      snack with crackers, a seafood cocktail, a salad, a      luncheon entree, or part of a buffet-quick and easy      to make, inexpensive, always popular . . . and especially      appetizing during the coming hot summer days!    </p>
