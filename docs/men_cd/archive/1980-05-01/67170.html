                <p>      <em>If flying varmints steal your poultry, take Nadine      Ross's advice and . . .</em>    </p>    <h1 id=" title">      FOIL THE CHICKEN HAWK    </h1>        <p>      Every year, I hatch about 50 chickens inside a simple      cardboard-box incubator (equipped with a light bulb and      thermometer). After the biddies are born, I keep them in      the kitchen for a while, putting the box in the yard for a      few hours on sunny days to let them get used to the      outside.<br />      <br />      When the little critters are about two weeks old, I      transfer them to a fencedoff corner of the chicken pen, and      they spend another couple of weeks there until the older      fowl are accustomed to having them around.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE ATTACK</strong><br />      <br />      Some years back-at a time shortly after my young      flock had been moved to outdoor quarters-I discovered      I was losing one or two tiny fledglings a day . . . and it      didn't take me long to find out why. The problem was hawks      . . . "wings of death" with tremendous appetites for      baby-chicken dinners.<br />      <br />      If I stayed out in the yard, the wily predators would just      circle overhead, watching . . . or they'd "hide" in the top      of a tall pine tree and wait for me to go back inside.      Since I couldn't stand guard all day, it soon became a      contest to see who could outsmart whom . . . and I kept      coming up the loser.<br />      <br />      Before long, 16 of my brood had succumbed to the swift      birds of prey, and the same thing was happening to my      neighbors' flocks. We were all becoming pretty angry and      frustrated, and-even though it's against the law to      shoot a hawk-some folks began to talk about getting      out the of shotgun.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE CONFRONTATION</strong><br />      <br />      The crisis came to a head when-one afternoon-I      walked out the back door just in time to startle a hawk      into dropping the piece of yellow fluff it had, that      instant, grabbed. I picked the poor victim up but, of      course, it was already dead. (Hawks hit mighty hard when      they swoop down on their prey.) Holding the limp little      form-still soft and warm-made my temper      boil!<br />      <br />      I looked up and spotted the villain sitting perfectly still      in the top of the tall pine near the chicken pen, and I      thought, "To heck with that blasted law . . . I'm going to      protect what's left of my chicks!"<br />      <br />      I went into the house for my .22 rifle . . . brought it out      and put it up to my shoulder . . . and got the hawk in my      scope. Suddenly, I was face to face with my enemy, and I      was stunned: The bird was a truly majestic and beautiful      creature ... and I knew I couldn't kill it.<br />      <br />      When the hawk finally flew away, 1 just stood there feeling      helpless. There was no doubt it'd soon be back.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE SOLUTION</strong><br />      <br />      The very next day-while I was changing the line on      one of my fishing reels-I got an idea that I figured      just might convince the hawks to start catching field mice      instead of my future egg-layers.<br />      <br />      The stakes around my chicken pen, made from mill trimmings,      are a foot or so higher than my head. I tied the old      fishing line around the tops of the posts, and crossed it      back and forth until I had lines -about a foot      apart-stretched over the entire area. The whole job      took me less than 30 minutes.<br />      <br />      Then I sat out on the porch steps and watched my      magnificent adversary soar high in the sky, make a few      circles over the chicken yard . . . and fly out of sight.      It was hard to believe a bird could see the nearly      invisible monofilament line from that distance, but      apparently the hawk did!<br />      <br />      That was 10 years ago, and I've never lost another chick to      a hawk! The fantastic birds are just too smart to fly into      a place they know they might not be able to get out of in a      hurry. (Just one word of caution: As soon as the line's no      longer neeaed, it should be removed. Otherwise, it'll rot      in the sunshine, break and fall into the pen, snare any      chicken that wanders into it . . . and you'll have the task      of freeing a squawking, flapping hen from yards of      tangled-up line.)<br />      <br />      My father refers to my anti-hawk technique as "chicken-pen      cobwebs" . . . and says he wishes he'd thought of it years      ago!    </p>
