        <p><em>Mark Twain</em></p><p>Well sir,the weather here at Plumtree Crossin' has up and got itself stuck betwixtspring and summer . . . an' the days has been mighty dull and dreary oflate. So much so, in fact, thet the ol' loafers over to the Gen'ral Storehas been hard pressed to come up with many subjects fit fer lyin' about!</p><p>Thetbein' the case, I have to admit thet I'm hound-dog grateful fer a pieceof down-home tomfoolery what arrived in the mail recently . . . from afeller name ol' Ed Griep. In point of fact, of Ed's narrytive is so all-firedamusin' thet I aim to sit back, relax, an' enjoy it right along with therest of you.</p><p>Lastevenin' (Ed begins), me an' ol' Sally Lou went over to the annual DonkeySoftball Benefit game. As usual, thet contest figgered to be a toe-to-toebattle betwixt the volunteer fire department's squad-called the "FoundationSavers"an' the American Legion Post 9, what took the name "Spitballers".</p><p>Nowas I'm sure you'll recall, them fellers use a softball nigh onto as bigas an October pumpkin. The object of the sport, o'course, is to git a hit,lope over to some walleyed mizzerble excuse fer a donkey, hop aboard, an'try to git to first base in the shortest time possible.</p><p>Asyou know, although the donkeys is told the rules of the game jist likeennyone elseand despite the fact them critters is all assured thet theyplays roles of the utmost importancethe beasts ain't always overly enthusiasticabout doin' they parts. Iffen a batter manages to hit the ball in the firstplace, an' iffen he's able to git his mount headed in the appropriate direction,he jist might reach base after five er ten minutes of coaxin' an' shoutin'"giddyup" . . . more often than not, though, the critters manage to outsmartthe ball players in one way er another.</p><p>Nowit seems thet one of the donkeys thet was brought in fer the contest wentby the name of Clementine. She were a second-season player, too . . . an'all the folks was happy to see ol' Clem 'cause she'd been a real stellarcompetitor in the precedin' year's event.</p><p>Sowhen the Foundation Savers won first ups, they naturally called out CallisonHawthorne (who had hisself a solid .125 battin' average an' was thereforethe team star) . . . an' their coachone Billy Bob Arnolddrug out ol'Clementine to give his champion ev'ry advantage.</p><p>Afterspittin' a fair half-quart of terbaccy juice 'round the infield, struttin'back an' forth across'home plate a-wavin' at his kin, an' shoutin' a fewinsults in the direction of Gunda Gray (the Spitballers' pitcher) . . .Callison settled hisself next to the bag, all ready an' waitin' fer thefirst pitch.</p><p>Is'pose I should remind you thetthough of Gunda is about the easiest goin'feller aroundhe don't take to teasin' too well. So, havin' jist been calleda "pointy-headed flatlander", he loaded up with a spitball what containedmore water than the Johnstown Flood of '32 an' flang it toward home plate. . . an' Callison up an' smacked thet wet cannonball in a spray spewin'line drive to center field.</p><p>Nowev'rybody on Gunda's team was familiar with his spitball prowess, so theywas all wearin' yeller slickers an' rain hats afore they took to the field.An'after hearin' Callison call Gunda a "creampuff"a few of the fellerswent so far as to don they swim goggles . . . figgerin' the game were likelyto het up some. In fact, the center fielderArlington Guentherwere riggedup with his nephew's goggles (which had a crack in one lens from one ofthem rock fights thet young'un seems to inspire ev'ry day er so) as hetrotted back under the still-droolin' fly ball.</p><p>Meanwhiles,of Callison flang hisself across Clementine's back an' commenced moseyin'toward first base. Now thet donkeyas a result of her particypation inthe previous year's gamehad figgered out thet the quicker she roundedthem bases, the sooner she'd be shut of carryin' players an' able to settledown to munchin' sweet clover agin. Furthermore, since the animal werea dang sight smarter than Callison (which ain't sayin' much), she recollectedof Gunda's spitball tossin' ability, too. So, when they headed out ferthe base, Clem kept one eye on where she was a-goin' an t'other on theflyin' ball . . . all the while stayin' well aware of the location of thenearest possible flood shelter.</p><p>Well,Arlington hollered out, "I got it"jist like they do in the pro'sbut thecracked goggles confused his vision an' he dropped the soggy sphere. Ol'Arl recovered quick, though . . . he picked up the ball an' throwed it-ashard as ev'r he couldto Richie Lee Summerfield, the first baseman.</p><p>NowClementine had, the year previous, contracted both swimmer's ear an' dishpanhooves from bein' smacked by one of Gunda's spitballs. So when she seedthet soppin' missile headed toward where she was pointed, she up and litout fer the bullpen. Callison (who were already soaked from hittin' theball) was determined to git on base come hell er high water, an' took powerfulexception to the donkey's change of plans.</p><p>Thoughhe pulled fer all he was worth, howev'r, Callison's efforts was in vain.Clementine bored headlong inta the bullpen . . . an' the bulls (what belongedto Marvin Coldfield, who was allowed to house 'em in the enclosure in exchangefer tendin' the ballpark grounds) lit outa there an' onto the playin' field.</p><p>Whenthe teams seed them cattle a-stampedin' toward 'em, they hightailed itfer safety by auto, pickup, and foot. At the same time, Clementine waskeepin' a weather eye on the bouncin' softball what Arlington had throwed.She watched it roll fer a ways, an' then come to a complete stop. Still-bean'cautious by natureClem waited a bit, to be sure it were safe, afore headin'back onto the playin' field.</p><p>Asshe charged back outa the pen, of Callison thonked his head a good shot,which caused him to swaller his chaw. Clementine didn't pay no mind toher rider's mishap, howev'r, an' headed right over to first base . . .then to second, third, an' on home.</p><p>Callisonjist wobbled along astride her all the while . . . with a vacant look plasteredon his face an' seemin'ly unaware ofan uncarin' aboutwhere he was headed.</p><p>O'course,inasmuch as the ballpark were completely empty of humans, there weren'tno actual speakin' witnesses to Callison's home run. In fact, them bullswere so busy cleanin' out Winslow Armbuster's popcorn stand thet they didn'tseem to notice the triumph either.</p><p>Howev'r,I did undertake a little research this mornin', an'as fer as I kin tellthey'snever been a home run hit in a donkey baseball game afore . . . nor a contestthet lasted fer only one pitch.</p><p>Callisondon't seem to care much about the fact thet he may well have set hisselfsome kind of unofficial record, though. It seems he's still got the blindstaggers from thumpin' his head, an' the chaw what he swallered is stilla-crouchin' mean in the bottom of his belly. So it's a safe bet he'll beoff his taters fer a spell.</p><p>Clementineain't feelin' no pain, howev'r, an' has even become somewhat of a localheroine.. Leastwise, her ownerLem Fairfieldhas seed fit to retire herfrom the donkey ride troupe what he takes around to the county schools. . . an' she spends her time happily grazin' on red clover, jist a-waitin'fer next year's game.</p><p><em>"Ifin the last few years you haven't discarded a major opinion or acquireda new one, check your pulse.
