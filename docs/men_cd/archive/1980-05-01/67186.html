                <p>      <em>For backyard cookout convenience-and "Insurance"      against power outages that could leave your kitchen      inoperative-here's an inexpensive way to start . .      .</em>    </p>    <h1 id=" title">      COOKIN' WITH GAS    </h1>        <p>      Just about everybody loves a cookout, but broiling over      charcoal can have some real drawbacks. You've got to      wrestle with bags of sooty briquets . . . handle-with      caution-the smelly and dangerous lighter fluid (that      often ends up flavoring your food) . . . and then wait, as      the young'uns clamor, for the coals to reach the proper      stage for cooking.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, in terms of convenience, propane-fired grills      are a pretty attractive alternative to charcoal. The fuel      used in such devices is safely enclosed in a compact      container . . . the burners light-and stay      lit!on-a single match ... and the fire is ready for      broiling almost immediately. The problem with the      convenient cookers has always been price: The least      expensive gas grills usually cost well over a hundred      dollars, and many sell for twice that amount.<br />      <br />      So, when we noticed an ad in our last issue for a barbecue      grill that offers all of the advantages listed above and      still sells for under $80 (shipping included), we decided      to order one of the units and check it out. Called "Le      Grille", the compact broiler has a 220-square-inch cooking      surface ... comes with a sturdy base that adapts to three      heights (9 inches for tabletop placement, and 18 or 30      inches for backyard cooking) ... is 100% cast iron . . .      runs off a standard one-pound propane tank . . . and      includes a free adapter for using an even more economical      20-pound fuel container.<br />      <br />      You needn't sacrifice that smoky charcoal-broiled flavor      when you cook with Le Grille, either. As you probably know,      the aroma and taste that we associate with outdoor cooking      is caused by the vaporization of fats dripping down onto      the glowing coals. The propane grill gets the same effect      with a tray of lightweight volcanic rocks that's positioned      above the gas flame. As the "coals" get hot, the dripping      fat is transformed into the familiar-and      delicious-"charcoal" smoke.<br />      <br />      What's more, the propane grill isn't just a convenience      item. One MOTHER staffer was mighty glad there was a gas      cooker in the house last winter, when a sudden ice storm      brought down wires and made the electric range about as      useful as wings on a pig! He just placed the grill in the      fireplace and opened the damper ... lit a match and turned      a knob . . . and soon the aroma of sizzling lamb chops      filled the chilly darkness. A good hot meal can really make      a difference in your outlook when the power is off and of      man winter is howlin' up a storm! (Of course, when you're      using any open-flame appliance indoors, always provide      ventilation to maintain breathing oxygen for you and      yours.)<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> <em>Le Grille is      available-for $79.95, postpaid-from BPS, Dept.      TMEN, P.O. Box 199, Mountain Home, North Carolina 28758.      (The firm asks that North Carolina residents add 4% sales      tax to their orders.)</em>    </p>
