                    <p>      <em><strong>Make an Indoor Garden With Your Children.</strong></em>    </p>		<h5 id="byline"> By      Nancy Fusco Castaldo</h5>        <p>      <em>If your kids are glued to the television set all day,      it's time to unpry them. Here's a method that they'll      actually enjoy: introduce them to gardening. By teaching      children how to plant and grow an indoor garden, you allow      them to create their own magical world. It's also a good      way to teach responsibility and respect for the      environment. So why not help your budding gardener bring a      bit of the outdoors inside this fall? Below are four easy      designs that will encourage your children to put down the      TV guide and pick up a gardening tool.</em>    </p>    <h3>A Miniature Herb Garden</h3>   <p>      <em>Herbs are not only beautiful and easy to grow, but they      come in an abundance of varieties. Children may enjoy      choosing their design around a specific theme, such as      "lovely s cents" for making potpourri, or "culinary herbs"      for making harvest treats. No matter which theme your      gardener decides upon, there are some basic supplies you      will need: a rectangular windowsill planter or other flower      pot, potting compost for seedlings, pebbles for drainage,      seeds or started plants, and a small trowel or shovel.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If your child enjoys the wonderful smells</em> of      <em>potpourri, suggest a garden filled with</em>      <em>the</em> <em>sweet aromas of lavender, lemon      thyme,</em> <em>mints, lemon balm, and scented      geraniums.</em> <em>Your child will take great pride in      drying the</em> <em>flowers and leaves and then handing      them</em> <em>out as potpourri gifts for family and      friends.</em> <em>(If your children start their gardening      project</em> <em>now, they will be able to give batches      of</em> <em>home-grown potpourri to others over the</em>      <em>holiday season.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Your children may</em> <em>want to create a      desert, complete with cacti and snake, or a tropical rain      forest.</em></strong>    </p>            <p>      <em>Culinary herb gardens always go over big with children,      too. Among favorite harvest treats are peppermint,      spearmint, nasturtiums, and basil. When buying your herbs,      remember that some are easily grown from</em>      <em>seeds-like nasturtiums, basil, and dilland others      are slower growing and better purchased as small      plant-like mint, thyme, and sage.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>One thing to remember is that mints will</em>      <em>frequently take over any container they are</em>      <em>planted in. However,</em> if <em>you are still      interest</em> <em>ed, you have two planting options: First,      you</em> <em>can choose to grow only mint in your con</em>      <em>tainer. Explain to your children that they do</em>      <em>not need a whole lot</em> of <em>plants to enjoy      an</em> <em>in</em> <em>door herb garden. You can also      highlight</em> <em>the</em> <em>ever-popular frosted mint      treats.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>This delicacy is easily made by dipping several mint      leaves into lightly beaten egg white and granulated sugar,      and allowing them to dry. (You'll be surprised how happy      you're kids will be with a garden of only mint.) Your other      option is to keep the mint in a small container embedded      into the garden, which will keep the roots bound in a      contained area. That way it won't take over the whole      garden.</em>    </p>    <p>      First, put the pebbles in the container's bottom to help      with drainage. Add a good layer of compost. If you are      using small plants, carefully tip them from their pots and      place them in the compost. Fill up the container with more      compost, pat it down so it's firm around the plant, and      then water. If you are planting from seed, you may start      the seeds in peat pots and then transfer them to the      planter or plant the seeds directly into the compost. Add      another layer of compost to the container and water. If you      cover the container with a plastic bag, it will create      moisture, and you will be able to water the seedlings less      often. When the weather is warm enough, transplant your      garden outside and continue enjoying your herbs all summer      long.    </p>    <h3>A Country Garden for a Sunny      Windowsill</h3>           <p>      <em>For this garden, you will need some small stones, a      large bowl or deep dish (the saucer from large clay pots      works well), compost, a small mirror, small plastic      animals, and some dried flowers. Lastly, and most      importantly, you will need some small plants, such as      alyssum, hens and chicks, thyme, or miniature trees.</em>    </p>    <p>      First, lay the stones on the bottom of your container, and      fill it with a layer of compost. Place your mirror in the      compost so that it resembles a still pond, and decorate the      surrounding area around with dried flowers and small      stones. They should be positioned so that the mirror will      catch their reflection (just as a real pond would).    </p>    <p>      Then position your plants so they look most natural. For      example, you could make small groupings of taller plants      and trees to resemble a wooded area on one side, and group      some smaller plants in other areas. When you and your child      are happy with the arrangement, place the plants into the      compost, and firm more compost around their bases. Water      your garden well.    </p>    <p>      Children's favorite part of the project is decorating with      tiny plastic animals. They can place a raccoon near the      wooded area, or a group of ducks near the pond. Older      children can make a more elaborate garden complete with      paths and decorated with miniature garden accessories. Your      children may want to create a desert, complete with cacti      and snake, or a tropical rain forest with a gorilla (a      great way to introduce the the importance of saving rain      forests and endangered species).    </p>    <p>      When your garden is complete, place it on a sunny      windowsill and be sure to water as the soil begins to dry      out. Certain plants may occasionally need to be clipped so      they'll remain small enough for the de sign. If you select      your plants from a nursery, ask about their growth habits      before you plant them.    </p>    <h3>A Flowering Crate</h3>         <p>      <em>With a little help from an adult, this is an easy      project for children to complete. Visit a nursery to select      your bulbs and ask if they are prechilled. Prechilled bulbs      will bloom indoors during the winter months; those that      aren't will bloom indoors during their regular spring      season. Children love to look through floral catalogs when      selecting bulbs. Of course, they'll also love ambling      through nurseries, picking their favorite flowers and      plants.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Ask kids to imagine what they would look like in a      crate. Flower combinations are endless. However, keep your      eyes open for fragrant narcissi, daffodils, hyacinths, and      tulips, which are especially colorful.</em>    </p>    <p>      Any wooden crate will do. Once you find a good-size one,      line the crate with a sheet of heavy plastic. Fold a border      over the edge of the crate and tack it down. Add some      drainage holes in the bottom of the plastic with scissors.    </p>    <p>      Next, place some stones on the bottom for drainage and add      soil. Plant your bulbs pointed end up, and follow the      directions provided by the nursery. Cover with more soil      and add water. Always make sure that your garden doesn't      dry out. As a finishing touch, tie a ribbon around your      crate. Soon you will have a crate full of blooms to enjoy.    </p>    <h3>A Bottle Garden</h3>      <p>      <em>This is a fun project that requires little maintenance.      All you need is a large bottle with a lid (a pickle or      mayonnaise jar will work fine), potting soil, charcoal, an      old fork and spoon, a small natural sponge, a funnel or      piece of paper, some small stones or washed gravel, a nail,      four 12-inch pieces of cane, and some rubber bands.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Making bottle gardens is best for older children. Be      prepared to give younger children a good deal of      supervision. When selecting plants for your bottle garden,      keep in mind that you will want taller varieties for height      and smaller plants to act as a ground cover. Some other      good choices for bottle gardens include baby's tears,      button ferns, African violets, and coffee plants. Again,      allow your children to select their own plants.</em>    </p>    <p>      Wash out your bottle thoroughly and remove any labels. (You      may have to soak the bottles in hot water if they are      difficult to peel off) Then use a funnel to pour in a layer      of small stones or gravel. If you don't have a funnel to      use, improvise with rolledup paper. Make sure the gravel or      stones are distributed evenly across the bottom before      adding the next layer. The charcoal comes next, followed by      the potting soil.    </p>    <p>      Next, you will have to lengthen your tools so you can reach      down into the jar. Take your rubber bands and fasten a      length of cane onto the fork, spoon, nail, and sponge.      Using your fork or spoon, dig small holes in the soil so      you'll be able to position your plants. Should the sides of      the bottle get dirty as you are working, clean them with      the dampened sponge. Remove the plants from their      containers, and lower each plant into the depressions of      the potting soil. Do this by piercing its root ball with      the nail. Then with the spoon or fork, carefully firm the      soil down around each plant. Make any necessary      adjustments, and then dean the bottle sides again with the      sponge. Water, and cover the bottle.    </p>    <p>      To maintain your bottle garden, keep the container out of      direct sunlight and monitor the amount of condensation on      the bottle's inside. If you see no water droplets on the      sides, add more. If they are covered with streams of      moisture, leave the bottle top off for a day.    </p>
