                <p><strong>      Country Lore</strong></p>        <p>      <strong>Turning trash into tools saves money-and the      planet</strong>    </p>    <h3>Putting Weeds to Use</h3>          <p>      Here's a tip for anyone who tends to get behind on weeding      their garden: Carefully remove weeds (don't dislodge the      plant's roots; you may need to firm soil around them      again), shake off all the dirt from the roots, and lay      weeds beside "keeper" plants in the row. Then, put bare      roots on top of weed tops so they can't take root and grow      again. They will act as a mulch by holding moisture and      preventing future weeds. They will also protect the      sensitive base of garden plants that are disturbed by      pulling big weeds. I've saved many a garden crop during      hectic times.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Sue Peeler<br />      Pollock, Missouri</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Rocky Road Birdhouse</h3>     <p>      From Pack Rat Press's <em>Reuse News, Vol. 2, No. 2</em>      comes a few creative ways to reuse empty 1/2-gallon ice      cream tubs and boxes. Make: a pet food canister, a plant or      potpourri holder, a colander (punch holes in the bottom and      lower sides), a napkin holder, storage for bait worms (fill      with coffee grounds), or best of all-a bird house.      You'll need: two lids, one tub, tie-wire or heavy string,      and a chunky twig.    </p>    <p>      Turn the tub upside down. Glue one lid to the new top to      repel rain. Attach the twig (or a button) onto the tie-wire      and punch it through the new top, creating a hanger. Cut a      round hole in the side of the tub and put the other lid      back onto the wide new-bottom opening. You can paint or      decorate these to suit, and you can stuff grass or dryer      lint inside to get the birds started.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-The Editors</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Parking Lot Plants</h3>    <p>      Here's a trick for starting seedlings. We live in a      100-year-old house, and we've had a lot of trouble finding      a good, warm spot to start seedlings. So I came up with      this solution: I take all my seed flats to work every day,      park in a sunny spot, and leave them in my car all day.      Within less than a week, they're all germinated.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Maureen Engel<br />      Methuen, Massachusetts</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>Lots o' Profit</h3>     <p>      Here's an idea for a surefire year-round moneymaker: If you      either own or can lease a couple of acres in a large city      or suburban area, here's a good way to earn a good living      and do a lot of good besides- little or no investment      required. Start a farmer's market, where farmers come in,      park their trucks, and peddle fruits and vegetables. Others      can sell homemade pies, jams, etc. You should charge      according to how big the seller's truck is, and how big of      a load they bring in.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Leroy E. Marchand<br />      Payallup, Washington</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Can Do!</h3>        <p>      I have developed an alcohol camp stove that you can make      out of a tuna can, a beef stew can, and a can opener in a      matter of minutes. This is the simplest, lightest, and      safest camp stove I have ever used, and I'd love to share      it with other low-budget campers.    </p>    <p>      First, use the can opener to make holes around the bottom      and top of the larger can. Make the holes about an eighth      of an inch apart, as large as possible. Use a pair of      pliers to curve the metal from the top holes around the top      of the can, and make a long narrow slit in the side of the      can for lighting the stove. Place the tuna can at the      bottom of the other can, fill it with alcohol, light it      with a match, and begin cooking. You will learn how much      fuel to add after you have had some experience with the      stove.    </p>    <p>      I tested this stove on a five day backpacking trip in The      Smokies. The stove boiled a pot of water in five minutes      (above 5000 feet).    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Rob Beshoof<br />      Manchester, Tennessee</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Handy Bags</h3>     <p>      Instead of using paint-tray liners, I put the whole tray      inside a plastic grocery bag (the kind with handles from      the supermarket). It fits just right, and I just twist the      handles around the "legs" of the tray a few times to keep      the bag from moving as the roller picks up paint. When      you're done, just turn the bag inside out and toss it.    </p>    <p>      Sewing a pair of heavy socks onto frayed "feety" pajamas is      a great way to add some extra miles onto your kids' Dr.      Dentons.    </p>    <p>      Also, here's a natural insect repellant: herbs or spices.      After making tea, allow the tea bags to dry out and then      place them at insect entry-points. It's self-contained,      clean, non-toxic, and pleasant-smelling. After a few      months, you can recycle by adding the "worn-out" tea to      your compost or till it into the soil. I've found this      method works farily well with ants, and is neater than      using sprays. Cinnamon sticks also make good insect      repellents, and add a nice flavor to your tea.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Dennis MacDonald<br /></em> <em>Los      Angles, California</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Counter Melt-Down</h3>      <p>      Here's a tip for those of you who deal with plastic      laminates (i.e. Formica): If by chance you glue it down in      the wrong place, don't despair. Heat it up with an infrared      heat lamp, and you'll be able to peel it right off.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-William A. Grover<br />      Nokomis, Florida</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Lighting the Way</h3>       <p>      Here's how we create fire starters, start camp fires, and      light our charcoal in the grill: We slowly melt our kids'      broken crayons and burned down candles, and then mix in      sawdust we've saved from making wood projects. Once cooled,      we cut out each egg cup from a cardboard egg carton and      wrap it in foil until used. (We always keep the foil for      the next batch.) To use this Fire Starter, simply light the      cardboard shell. The starter will burn for 15 to 30 minutes      depending on the amount of wax used.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Steve Martinez<br />      Wheaton, Illinois</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Retread Your Feeties</h3>     <p>      There's nothing worse than when the souls of your "feety"      pajamas wear out during those freezing winter nights.      Fortunately, there's a way to fix them up so that you can      keep your feet (and your children's feet) warm and cozy.    </p>    <p>      Collect all of your family's unusable feeties, cut the feet      off of them, and sew on a pair of heavy socks in their      place. Be sure to use socks that are one size larger than      what your child is currently wearing. It's a great way to      add some extra miles on your kids' Dr. Dentons.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Kay Zorn</em> <em><br />      Willow Springs, Missouri</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>SEWING A PAIR OF HEAVY SOCKS ONTO FRAYED      "FEETY" PAJAMAS IS A GREAT WAY TO ADD SOME EXTRA MILES ONTO<br />      YOUR KIDS' DR. DENTONS.</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Picnic for Three</h3>    <p>      My husband likes his wildlife at a distance, preferably      with a windshield between him and it. Recently, we were      seated on the lawn, having a picnic of chicken, fruit, and      bread, when a wasp flew over and started circling him      menacingly. Bob batted at it angrily. Of course I told him      that it was the worst thing he could do-it just gets      them angrier, making them more likely to sting.    </p>    <p>      So my husband stopped batting at it, and quickly spread a      paper napkin on the lawn. Then he placed a chicken bone      with some scraps of meat on hit. Sure enough, the wasp lost      interest in him and settled down to enjoy the miniature      picnic feast while we enjoyed our own picnic.    </p>    <p>      <strong>-Kay Haugaard<br />      Pasadena, California</strong>    </p>        <h3>Keeping Tabs</h3>     <p>      Tired of digging up the end of your adhesive, masking, or      scotch tape on the roll? Try using the little tabs that      keep bread-wrapper ends closed. Put them under the end of      the tape and then lift up the next time you use it. It will      come off nice and easy.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Bob Gragg</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>Look Ma, No Holes</h3>      <p>      If you're looking for a spackling compound for patching      small holes and cracks in plaster walls, try toothpaste.      Any kind of white toothpaste will due. It's easy to apply      and smooth out, and it dries surprisingly hard. No sanding      will be required if you blend the paste into the plaster by      rubbing the filler with a little water. This spackle takes      paint well and can be cleaned from tools and brushes easily      with just a little washing. And leave your rings      on-toothpaste is a great way to shine your rings and      other delicate pieces of gold jewelry.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Vern Johnson<br />      Bettendorf, Iowa</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>Tender Gloving Care</h3>      <p>      Do your children always seem to lose one glove after coming      home from a winter outing? If so, build your family a rope      ladder clothesline (miniature lines set up in a vertical      pattern).    </p>    <p>      Pick a free corner in your house, and hammer a nail into      the wall about a foot and a half to the left of the      corner's seam. Hammer another nail directly across from      it-about a foot and a half to the right. (Shorten or      lengthen the distance according to the length of      clothesline you wish to use.) Then tie a piece of rope or      string from one nail to other, and hang a few clothes pins      on it. Repeat the process, leaving 10 to 12 inches of space      between lines so there's space to hang the gloves. Put up      enough lines for each family member. If you position them      right, even the smallest family member will be able to hang      us his or her own gloves.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Carole M. Wooden<br />      Spencer, Tennessee</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>Wet Hoe!</h3>     <p>      We work up our garden in the fall to make it ready for      early spring planting. When we get a week or two of rainy      weather-just at the time we'd like to plant-we      make rows with the hoe (even if it is wet). Then we plant      the seeds in the moist soil, and cover them with damp fill      sand. Even if the sun comes out and crusts over the dirt,      the tiny sprouts will come right up through the sand.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Joy Gonnerman<br />      St. Paul, Nebraska</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's note: M OTHER'S Country Lore section is a      great chance for you to share your practical, down-home      solutions to life's most frustrating problems.
