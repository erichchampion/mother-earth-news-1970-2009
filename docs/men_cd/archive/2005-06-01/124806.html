        Can your surplus garden produce during the summer, and you canenjoy high quality food all winter. There's a great advantage tocanning food from your own back yard: You will always get the bestflavor and highest quality from picking food at its freshest, andprocessing it the same day.<br /><br />To begin canning at home, the two main tools you will need are awater bath canner and a pressure canner. Canner selection dependson the type of food you are preserving. Although bacteria won'tsurvive in high-acid foods such as fruits and tomatoes, they canthrive in low-acid foods including vegetables and meats. Forlow-acid foods, it's necessary to use a pressure canner, whichreaches temperatures higher than the boiling point. Acidic foods,including most fruits, are processed in a boiling water bath. Toavoid contaminating food with bacteria, always follow any canningrecipe exactly, and be particularly cautious with low-acidfoods.<br /><br />Water bath canners are available for $20 to $30, while a goodpressure canner can cost as much as $200. Both should come with arack to keep jars off the bottom of the pot. Every canning book orinstruction manual comes with charts detailing common foods andtheir respective canning methods, and also typically includesstep-by-step instructions for the entire canning process. LocalExtension offices often have free pamphlets explaining how to candozens of different fruits and vegetables.
