                          <p>      Congress, states address global warming.    </p>    <p>      The Kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is      helping draw attention to the problem of global warming,      and efforts already are under way to address the issue in      Congress and in many states despite the Bush      administration’s inaction.    </p>    <p>      Although the United States is responsible for about 24      percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, it      is one of only four industrialized nations that did not      sign the treaty. The others are Australia, Croatia and      Monaco.    </p>    <p>      The Kyoto Protocol went into effect on Feb. 16, marking a      major step in the worldwide effort to reduce greenhouse gas      emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which      experts agree are contributing to global climate change.      With the treaty in effect, 35 industrialized countries are      now committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by      2012.    </p>    <p>      A week before the Kyoto Protocol went into effect, Sen.      John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.,      reintroduced the Climate Stewardship Act, a plan to limit      greenhouse gas emissions from industry, electricity      generation and automobiles, by creating an emissions      trading program.    </p>    <p>      “The evidence is clear that the problem is here, and      that’s why we have to do something about it,”      Lieberman said when introducing the bill. “Doing      nothing is no longer an option.” Lieberman and McCain      will hold public meetings across the country to raise      awareness about the problem of climate change, according to      Lieberman’s office.    </p>    <p>      Also in February, the Environmental Protection Agency      launched the Clean Energy-Environment State Partnership      Program, which helps states “to improve air quality,      decrease energy use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and      enhance economic development.” The program kicked off      in 11 states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia,      Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio,      Pennsylvania and Texas.    </p>    <p>      However, many states already have taken action, with      California setting some of the toughest new standards.      “The two biggest sources of greenhouse gases      nationally are smokestacks and tailpipes,” says Jason      Mark, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’      Clean Vehicles Program. “California has the      nation’s leading policies on both and the most      aggressive renewable energy policy.”    </p>    <p>      California’s most ambitious policy to reduce      greenhouse gases may be the state’s new auto      emissions standards, which were released last fall. These      standards will place new limits on greenhouse emissions      that will take effect for model year 2009 cars and trucks,      if the standards can survive a legal challenge from      automobile manufacturers. (For more information on this      case, go to www.ucsusa.org and search for “automakers      v. the people.”)    </p>    <p>      California’s new emissions standards, however,      already are making an impact nationally. According to Susan      Brown, a senior policy analyst with the California Energy      Commission, nine other states have expressed an interest in      adopting the standards. Connecticut, Massachusetts and New      York have publicly committed, and Oregon, Washington and      others are exploring the possibility. “While      individual states cannot combat global warming alone, by      acting together, states can demonstrate global leadership      on climate change and significantly reduce greenhouse gas      emissions,” Brown says.    </p>    <p>      Many other states have come up with programs to combat      climate change, from a no-till program in Georgia to reduce      farmers’ fuel use, to a Wyoming plan for an emissions      trading system. In addition, state governors have signed      two regional plans: The West Coast Governors’ Global      Warming Initiative launched by the governors of California,      Oregon and Washington in 2003, and the 2001 Climate Change      Action Plan developed for the Northeastern United States      and eastern Canada. A list of state and national policies      is available at      www.climatechange.ca.gov/policies/national_summary.html.    </p>    <p>      Whether or not your state has a plan to address global      climate change, you can make your voice heard on this issue      by contacting your legislators.

Instead,      they’re rallying government officials to prohibit      burning household waste in backyard barrels.espite      scientific evidence that shows such burning can produce      toxic dioxins, many rural communities across the United      States continue to permit private waste incineration.    </p>    <p>      Federal law does not regulate barrel, or backyard burning,      as it is sometimes called. Across the United States,      uncontrolled barrel burning produces the “largest      quantified source of dioxin emissions,” according to      the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These dioxin      emissions can lead to an increased risk of cancer, heart      disease and reproductive and respiratory problems.    </p>    <p>      “You don’t have to be occupationally exposed or      live near a toxic waste dump. It’s in your      food,” says Chris Neurath, www.burnbarrel.org manager      and activist in DeKalb, N.Y. “Dioxins from burn      barrels end up making their way to all Americans, even if      they live in the middle of New York City.”    </p>    <p>      Dioxins are a group of highly toxic chemicals formed when      chlorinated materials are exposed to heat. They are      classified as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic      pollutants (PBTs). PBTs are long-lasting substances that      can build up in the food chain to levels that are harmful      to human and ecosystem health.    </p>    <p>      Even when materials containing high levels of chlorine,      such as PVC plastics, are removed from household trash,      burning the waste still creates dioxins because nearly all      household waste contains trace amounts of chlorine, the EPA      says.    </p>    <p>      The dioxins created through backyard burning settle on      plants. These plants in turn are eaten by meat and dairy      animals, which store the dioxins in their fatty tissue.      People are exposed to dioxins primarily by eating meat,      fish or dairy products. According to the EPA, these harmful      chemicals are difficult to avoid.    </p>    <p>      Some state legislatures already have heeded the EPA’s      warnings about backyard burning. California and New Mexico,      for example, banned the practice last year. In upstate New      York, residents continue to wrangle over issues such as      rights of the individual, money-saving advantages of      backyard burning, community health and environmental      concerns - as they decide whether to prohibit      backyard burning.    </p>    <h3>      To create awareness, www.burn    </h3>    <p>      barrel.org sponsored the second annual Tour de Burn Barrel,      a four-day bike tour covering more than 200 miles of      burn-barrel country in New York. The organizers pledged to      return until the state legislature bans barrel burning.    </p>    <p>      Despite such campaigns, not everyone has joined the effort      to eliminate backyard burning. But even households that      continue backyard burning can do certain things to reduce      the direct harms of this practice, such as recycling and      buying products in bulk - habits that decrease the      amount of trash to burn.    </p>    <p>      Still, legislation is the key to resolving this problem      that affects everyone, Neurath says.    </p>    <p>      “Education without clear regulatory action will not      be convincing to many people,” he says. “People      are likely to say ‘open burning can’t be that      bad if it’s legal and I see lots of others doing      it.’ So, solving the problem of barrel burning will      likely involve carrots, sticks and education.”    </p>    <p>      <em>- Patrice R. Holderbach</em>    </p>    <h3>      S prouts & Snippets    </h3>    <p>      <strong><em>Grants for Rural Businesses</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      The U.S.epartment of Agriculture is offering $11.4 million      in grants for renewable energy systems and energy      efficiency improvements by agricultural producers and rural      small businesses. The grants cover technologies such as      geothermal, solar and wind energy, as well as      energy-efficiency improvements. Renewable energy grant      applications must be for a minimum of $2,500 and a maximum      of $500,000. Energy-efficiency grant applications may range      from $2,500 to $250,000.eadline for applications is June      27.

In 2004,      shares of the world’s 24 publicly traded solar      companies jumped by nearly 185 percent. Experts say the      solar photovoltaics (PV) market will grow from $7 billion      to $30 billion by 2010. Solar PV, with its annual growth      rate exceeding 30 percent, is about to become “one of      the world’s fast-growth, profitable”      industries, according to the newsletter. Among the      companies mentioned are Japan’s Sharp,      Germany’s SolarWorld and U.S.-based Evergreen Solar.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Sustainable Summer BBQ</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Many summer activities such as family reunions and outdoor      parties revolve around the backyard grill.
