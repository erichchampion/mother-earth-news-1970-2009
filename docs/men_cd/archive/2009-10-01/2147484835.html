        <p>In the midst of all the gloom, we’re happy to report some good news. <a href="http://www.claytonhomes.com/" target="_blank">Clayton Homes</a>, a subsidiary of Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, has announced its line of green modular homes. These 750-square-foot eco homes, dubbed “i-houses,” can be purchased online for less than $75,000.</p><p>The green buildings have enough eco-friendly features to achieve the platinum rating from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. To achieve LEED certification, homes must incorporate a design that saves energy and water, reduces carbon dioxide emissions, improves indoor environmental quality, and considers the impact of the materials used on natural resources. The <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/" target="_blank">platinum rating is LEED’s most prestigious award</a>.</p><p>The i-houses include low-flow faucets, low-VOC materials, high-efficiency heat pumps, dual-flush toilets, roofs designed for rainwater harvesting, and insulated walls, roof and floors. Upgrades to bamboo flooring, Energy Star appliances and solar panels are also offered.</p><p>Despite the housing crunch, Clayton Homes is putting additional research and development into the i-houses, which CEO and president Kevin Clayton thinks will keep the project thriving.</p><p>Exact pricing is determined by several factors, including the model and features that are chosen.
