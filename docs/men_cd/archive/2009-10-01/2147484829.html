        <p>Here in Montana, the winter months can drag out. So, while waiting for spring, I like to make plant gift baskets.</p><p>I take cuttings from my plants (herbs or houseplants), buy more plants that are on clearance and pick up small baskets from thrift stores. These baskets are transformed into get-well, wedding or birthday baskets.</p><p>To do this, place the plastic bag on the bottom of the basket, rolling the mouth of the plastic down to form a lip on the edge of the basket. Then fill the lined basket with potting soil and carefully plant the greens to make a miniature garden - one plant draping off to the side, one erect in the middle, and another short, flowering plant on the other side.</p><p>For a more finished look, place decorative moss over the plastic lip. Keep the soil moist for three or four weeks, until the plants become established.</p><p>The plant gift baskets are easy to care for and will provide the recipient with months of color.</p><h5>Julie Heetderks<br />Bozeman, Montana</h5>
