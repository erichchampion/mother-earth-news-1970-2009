        <p>Thanks to a new website, shipping your next package could be easier on both the environment and your pocketbook.</p><p>CitizenShipper works by connecting people who need items shipped with people who are already traveling in that direction. Visitors can sign up as either a CitizenShipper or a CitizenCourier.</p><p>CitizenCouriers list the routes of trips they are planning to take. CitizenShippers list what items they need shipped, where they need it to go and how much they are willing to pay a courier. The website then connects compatible participants.</p><p>To ensure package safety, CitizenShippers have the option of choosing couriers who have gone through a verification process. The website also has a feedback system that allows both shippers and couriers to rate their transactions. The service is free and offered worldwide to reduce the need for inefficient delivery vehicles.</p><p>“We believe that if enough people use this service, we can make a significant impact on reducing the country’s carbon footprint,” says founder Richard Obousy.</p><p>Read more at the <a href="http://www.citizenshipper.com/" target="_blank">CitizenShipper website</a>.</p>
