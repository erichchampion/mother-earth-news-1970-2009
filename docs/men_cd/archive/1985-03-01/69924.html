    <p>
                <p>      <em>There's something in the air, and it's most certainly      not the fresh breath of spring.</em>    </p>            <p>      In 1982, the Federal Republic of Germany reported that 8%      of its forests had lapsed into serious decline. A number of      species showed yellowing, loss of leaves, deformed shoots,      deteriorating roots, thinning crowns, and loss of growth .      . . and many trees had died. Cries of alarm went forth. But      by the next year the damage estimate had grown to encompass      a full 34% of Germany's forests-including 76% of all      firs, more than 40% of spruce and pine, and half of all the      trees in the famous Bavarian and Black forests. The total      area affected by such tree damage in Germany is now      estimated to be almost 6,200,000 acres, and sick trees in      other western European nations-such as Austria,      Switzerland, and France-bring the total threatened      acreage to almost 10,000,000.    </p>    <p>      In the U.S.-after several years of sporadic reports      of forest damage at high-elevation locations such as      Camel's Hump, Vermont, where 70% of the red spruce have      died since 1964-researchers around the country are      beginning to confirm that forest damage isn't confined to      the Northeast.    </p>    <p>      At altitudes above 6,300 feet on Mount Mitchell, North      Carolina, and the surrounding Blue Ridge and Smoky Mountain      peaks, the growth rate of red spruce and Fraser fir has      dropped 40% since the early 1960's, and many trees have      died. The defoliated white corpses of many of these      evergreens stand as testimony to some new weakness . . .      one that can't be attributed solely to known natural      causes. For example, though red spruce may have become more      susceptible to the ravages of the balsam woolly aphid, a      long-standing enemy, the effects of that pest don't explain      the dieback of Fraser fir, which is immune to that insect's      attack.    </p>    <p>      At lower elevations, the United States Forest Service has      tentatively concluded, stands of southern yellow pine have      for some reason experienced a 25% growth decline in the      last 30 years. And researchers in the Ohio Valley have      identified damage and growth declines of evergreens and      hardwoods over an area stretching from Wisconsin through      Indiana and Ohio. What's more, besides the well-known      damage to evergreens in New England, maples in parts of      Vermont have recently been found to be reproducing poorly      and to have declined 25% in overall mass.    </p>    <h3>      THE TOXICANT HIT LIST    </h3>    <p>      What's happening to the world's forests? Are these die-offs      attributable to natural stresses? Few scientists believe      so. More and more experts are concluding that the trees are      succumbing, at least in part, to man-made      pollution-in the forms of acid rain, ozone, nitrogen      oxides, sulfur dioxide, and toxic heavy metals. It may be      that just one of these toxicants is overwhelming trees in      isolated instances, but in general the problem seems to be      the combined effects of all or many of these pollutants.    </p>    <p>      Because the Germans have such a serious problem, they've      been quick to search for the specific causes of forest      decline. Though German scientists were ready initially to      place the blame on acid rain and the aluminum it can      liberate from a bound state in soil, a closer look pointed      out a number of deficiencies in that theory. For one,      forest damage has been found in acid and alkaline soils      alike. What's more, an examination of soil chemistry showed      that natural (humic) acids in the organic litter layer on      top of forest soil could be a much more powerful influence      than low-pH rainfall . . . particularly in soils that lack      calcium carbonate for buffering. In fact, if a cubic yard      of 3.5-pH rain were to fall on a square yard of forest soil      covered with a two-inch layer of organic matter, the total      acidity of the natural acids in the soil would be 500 times      that of the rainfall. The effects of these natural acids,      which might typically have a pH of 4.0 to 4.5, would easily      outweigh the influence of acid rainfall, even though the      rainfall might have a lower pH.    </p>    <p>      An interesting point to ponder concerning acid rain,      however, is that sulfur dioxide gas (a precursor of      sulfuric acid rainfall) can damage plant life. Before SO 2      ever becomes an acidic liquid, it can significantly stunt      tree growth. These effects have been seen at concentrations      of 25 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter-about half the U.S.      standard for public health (80 micrograms per cubic meter).      Thus the effects of sulfur dioxide pollution on trees could      be most serious <em>before</em> the gas becomes acid      precipitation.    </p>    <p>      Ozone is another potential contributor to forest decline.      Excessive levels of O 3 produced from nitrogen oxide      reacting in sunlight with hydrocarbons from car exhaust,      woodstoves, etc.-have long been known to harm plants.      At concentrations not even twice as great as natural      background levels, ozone can degrade the waxy protective      layer of leaf tissue, which leads to leakage of plant      fluids. At present, this surface breakage is the strongest      link known to widespread calcium and magnesium      deficiencies. The most plausible explanation of these      deficiencies-and of the attendant yellowing seen in      so many forests today-is leaf damage from a      combination of ozone and acidic water.    </p>    <p>      Ozone is particularly worrisome because it can damage      foliage at concentrations of 100 to 200 micrograms per      cubic meter if these conditions occur on six to eight      successive days . . . conditions that, in the last 20      years, have been common over much of the earth's surface.      (Oddly, swings into and out of the damaging concentration      range are more destructive than consistently high levels.      There is, however, almost always fluctuation, because the      production of ozone requires sunlight.) Levels of O 3 in      German forests are known to <em>average 100</em> to 150      micrograms per cubic meter, and peaks in the 400 to 500      range aren't unusual. In the U.S., ozone is largely blamed      for an 80% decline in forest productivity in the San      Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles.    </p>    <p>      The other main progenitors of acid rain, nitrogen oxides,      can also, in their gaseous phase, damage trees. Nitrogen is      a powerful fertilizer, and both NO x and nitric acid can be      absorbed through leaf tissue and put to work as nutrients.      But when a plant is presented with an      <em>overabundance</em> of food, two problems can afflict      it. First, the roots may reduce their uptake of water and      minerals from the soil, which may lead to drought      sensitivity and mineral deficiencies. And second, to      compound the initial problem, a tree may produce tender new      growth after receiving a breath of NO x -even though      autumn has arrived and a killing frost is on its way. The      normal (protective) dormancy periods may be disrupted.    </p>    <p>      Another clue to the puzzle of forest decline is that soils      in many areas of heavy damage contain abnormally high      levels of toxic heavy metals. We've already mentioned      aluminum, but lead, cadmium, zinc, arsenic, copper, and      chromium are also prevalent and harmful. On Camel's Hump in      Vermont, lead has doubled, zinc is up 70%, and copper      concentrations have risen 40% since monitoring began about      20 years ago. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has      identified toxic levels of zinc, copper, chromium, and      aluminum in trees. Tentative results from soil tests on      Mount Mitchell show concentrations of lead more than five      times higher than would be normal for an <em>urban</em>      area. All of these metals can stunt the growth of trees,      make them more susceptible to disease, or even kill them      outright.    </p>    <p>      The major sources of heavy metals are industry (largely      smelters) and vehicles, and it's known that metallic      compounds thrown into the air from smokestacks and tail      pipes can travel some distance from their sources. Studies      of the emissions from International Nickel's      1,250-foot-high stack show that 40% of the heavy metals      that leave the chimney travel at least 35 miles before      being deposited on the ground. Their mobility is probably      linked to the acidity of moisture in clouds, which allows      the metals to react with other compounds to form      transportable molecules. Thus acid rain and toxic metals      may again be "working together" in a damaging manner.      There's also the possibility, however, that cars and trucks      closer to the damaged trees are causing much of the      problem.    </p>    <h3>      I FEAR THAT WE SHALL NO MORE SEE . . .    </h3>    <p>      It's clear, then, that there's little likelihood that the      decline of forests around the world can be rightly      attributed to a single pollutant. Scientists generally      agree that the destruction is being brought on by an      amalgam of atmospheric contaminants spewed forth by power      plants, industry, and vehicles. It's true that this trend      began in the U.S. before the Clean Air Act's provisions      were in place, but there's quite a bit of evidence that the      improvement in air quality since 1970 hasn't been      sufficient to halt forest decline.    </p>    <p>      No one can say just how many trees could be saved by      further emission controls. For example, it's possible that      cutting sulfur dioxide emissions by, say, 20 or 30% would      not reduce acid precipitation at all, because there's      evidence that the relationship between sulfur dioxide in      the air and low-pH rainfall isn't linear. (See the sidebar      for more discussion of this point.) On the other hand,      reducing emissions by 90% would be almost certain to yield      an improvement.    </p>    <p>      Since the Clean Air Act was passed, sulfur dioxide      emissions have leveled of and are expected to remain fairly      constant through the end of the century-even without      new controls. Nitrogen oxides, on the other hand, have      doubled since the early 1950's and are continuing to rise.      As of 1980, NO x contributed about 30% of the acid      precipitation problem, but its share is expected to rise      over the next 15 years.    </p>    <p>      Most current legislative proposals suggest that      coal-burning utilities should further reduce sulfur dioxide      emissions by about 10 to 12 million tons per year. Various      experts estimate that the cost of these improvements would      increase electrical rates between 4 and 15% on the average.      But customers of particularly dirty utilities, such as      those in the Ohio Valley, would be hardest hit.    </p>    <p>      Nitrogen oxide emissions could be reduced by about 50%      through combustion modification practices . . . and at a      cost of only about a 1% rate increase. Beyond that point,      however, more complex techniques would be needed. Selective      catalytic reductions could cut power plant emissions of NO      x by 90% while causing a rate increase of 5 to 8%. Of      course, though power plants are the single largest source      of NO x today, they produce less than half of the total      nitrogen oxide emissions in the U.S. For effective control,      industry NO x emissions would also have to be controlled,      and the transportation sector-despite dramatic      reductions already made through the use of catalytic      converters-would have to make still further      improvements. (Yes, your car's catalytic converter is here      to stay.)    </p>    <p>      With reductions in NO x and hydrocarbon emissions (through      the use of catalysts, for example) come concomitant cuts in      ozone levels, because the concentrations of the first two      compounds (along with sunlight levels) affect the formation      of 03. This emphasizes the importance of regulating      nitrogen oxide emissions, and suggests that further      improvements may have to be made on emitters of      hydrocarbons, such as cars and residential heating systems.    </p>    <p>      Lead emissions from automobiles are slated for further      reductions as leaded gasoline is phased out in 1986.      Control of other heavy metals, however, is more      problematic. Industrial processes (and particularly      smelters) would need innovative controls to achieve major      emission reductions.    </p>    <p>      At present, Japan is the world's model for stringent      emission controls. Not only does that country have stricter      vehicle pollution regulations than the U.S., but it's also      the only government to limit nitrogen oxides coming from      power plants. Cutting NOx by 73% and SO2 by an even greater      amount has cost the utility customers of Japan a rate      increase of about 25%. As a result, Japan's air quality has      improved dramatically in the last 20 years.    </p>    <h3>      . . A THING AS LOVELY AS A TREE    </h3>    <p>      High technology isn't the only way to trim emissions,      however. In the U.S., improvements in efficiency-resulting      in the use of less energy-have done as much to help clear      the air as have stack emission controls. And the clean air      of Japan is, to a significant extent, a result of that      country's conservation practices: The Japanese use 2.7      times less energy per person than the American populace. If      we were to institute plausible conservation standards for      just water heaters, refrigerators, and air conditioners, we      could cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 12 to 20% by the turn      of the century . . . and at a cost equal to 1% of the      investment in flue gas desulfurization equipment that would      be needed to do the same job. Furthermore, every ton of      recycled copper prevents 2.7 tons of SO 2 from entering the      atmosphere; that technique alone has cut Canada's sulfur      dioxide emissons by a million tons per year, 21% of its      total output. Similar savings can be achieved by recycling      paper and aluminum. Reusing metals also reduces the burden      of toxic metal pollution by limiting mining and smelting,      two major sources.    </p>    <p>      No matter what specific relationship acid precipitation may      have to other forms of atmospheric pollution, and no matter      which one or what combination of these is causing the      obvious damage to our ecosystem, <em>burning less fossil      fuel is</em> bound to reduce the concentrations of the      majority of forms of atmospheric pollution in our      environment. Our best investment in pollution abatement is      to put our money in efficiency, recycling, and appropriate      renewable energy sources . . . to learn how to live with      our ecosystem instead of attempting to patch it up with      afterthought repairs. The central feature of any natural      system is the manner in which all parts are inevitably      interrelated, forming a circle of function; in the long      run, technology won't allow us to stand outside that      circle. As it goes, we go.    </p>    <p>      How are the trees in <em>your</em> yard doing?    </p>    <h3>      Is It Time to Do Something About Acid Rain?    </h3>    <p>      <em>It should be fairly clear by now that the</em>      <em>decline</em> <em>of</em> <em>forests in North America      and Europe can't be specifically pinned on acid</em>      <em>rain. A collection</em> <em>of</em> <em>atmospheric      contaminants, including acidic deposition, is probably to      blame. Does this mean that the hullabaloo over acid rain in      recent years has</em> <em>been overinflated or that the      current federal policy</em> <em>of</em> <em>waiting for the      results</em> <em>of</em> <em>further research before taking      action is warranted? Let's take a brief look at the state      of</em> <em>knowledge about acid rain as</em> <em>of</em>      <em>this writ</em> ing (late 1984); then you decide.    </p>    <p>      <em>There's nearly unanimous agreement that acid rain does      exist and that it's at least a local problem. Furthermore,      few scientists doubt that the emission</em> <em>of</em>      <em>sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants,      industry, and vehicles can and does cause acid deposition.      From those two points, however, opinions diverge. Perhaps      the most important and perplexing problems are these: [1]      Can the emission of pollutants from a particular source be      linked to acidic products falling out</em> <em>of</em>      <em>the sky hundreds of miles away? [2] How do the gaseous      emissions become acidic products, and what controls the      degree</em> <em>of</em> <em>their formation? [3] What      effect does acid deposition have on living things?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[1] Despite the fact that the complexities of the      transportation and dispersion of clouds of pollutants are      not well understood, scientists have been able to develop      models that accurately predict</em> where <em>these plumes      will go. They have theories that can be experimentally      verified, but they lack a complete explanation</em>      <em>of</em> <em>why the theories work. (This is called a      heuristic model by the scientific community.) Of course,      it's not very satisfying for the researchers to say, "We      know what happens, but we don't know why. " But for the      purposes of being able to say just</em> who's      <em>polluting</em> what, <em>the evidence is satisfactory.      The emissions from a coal fired power plant in the Ohio      Valley can be followed to the Adirondack</em> <em>Mountains      . . . or to Canada. So when you read or hear that more      research is needed to determine how acid rain is      transported, you might agree. But</em> don't <em>conclude      that the need for more study should prevent regulators from      pointing an accusing finger!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[2] Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide gases become      acidic products through complex reactions with oxidants,      such as hydroxyl radical (OH,) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O      2 ), in the atmosphere. Without oxidants, SO 2 and NO x      would not become acid precipitation. The      concentrations</em> <em>of ox</em> <em>idants in the air      appear to be a function of ozone and sunshine levels,      both</em> <em>of</em> <em>which vary significantly. It's      already known, for example, that the pH of precipitation in      winter is higher than in summer . . . even if the same      amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are present      in the atmosphere. The suspicion, therefore, is that raised      or lowered levels of pollutants do not dictate</em>      parallel <em>changes in the acidity of precipitation. And      to confuse matters further, nitrogen oxides themselves are      involved in the production of ozone, suggesting that there      may be a feedback loop between nitrogen oxides, ozone, and      acid precipitation.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And why are geochemists so speculative about the      chemistry of acid rain? Well, to give just one example,      looking for hydroxyl radical is far more difficult than      looking for a needle in a haystack. Each OH+ molecule      exists for only a few thousandths of a second, and it's so      rare that the detection level is only a few parts per      quadrillion. That's the equivalent</em> <em>of</em>      <em>trying to find one particular hair on all the heads on      earth.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To make matters worse, not all acidic products fall as      rain, snow, or fog. Some form</em> <em>particles or attach      themselves to other particles and fall as</em> dry      <em>deposition. Unfortunately, this process isn't even as      well understood as the chemistry of acid rain. How much      falls as dry deposition? Nobody knows</em> <em>for sure,      because no one has yet figured out a good way to measure      dry deposition. A common guess, however, is that maybe as      much as 40%</em> of <em>the acidic products fall as dry      material.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So when you read or hear that there's just not enough      known about acid rain to say exactly what needs to be done      and what the effects of applying certain controls would be,      you can believe it. Yes, more research needs to be done.      Most scientists would agree, however, that cutting SO 2 and      NO x emissions would reduce acid rain significantly.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[3] Despite those uncertainties, we know that acid      deposition does make it to the ground, and it does have      effects on living things. The article that this sidebar is      attached to describes some of the evidence concerning the      effects of acid precipitation on trees. There are also      thousands of lakes in the U.S., Canada, and Sweden that      have died as their waters have become more acidic. By      death, we mean that about the only thing that lives in the      water is filamentous algae. To go along with the death of      lakes, there's a huge collection</em> of <em>circumstantial      evidence linking episodes</em> of <em>highacidity water      (from rains and snowmelt) to massive fish kills. Watch out,      though: The Ph.D.'s aren't too sure just why a stream</em>      full of <em>trout would be done in by a low-pH summer      shower. Aluminum may be the culprit, since acidic water      mobilizes the toxic metal from soil and rock. Once again,      however, the boundaries</em> of <em>modern science stop      before this can be proven. Measurement techniques aren't      yet up to distinguishing between harmful and innocuous      forms</em> of <em>aluminum in water.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>No, the exact effects</em> of <em>acid rain aren't      understood. But one glance at the forests and lakes      downwind from the International Nickel smelter near      Sudbury, Ontario, or at any one of the several hundred dead      lakes in the Adirondacks, will convince you that there</em>      are <em>effects . . . disastrous ones.</em>    </p>
