                <p>      You can turn a love of books (and some knowledge of their      worth) into a part-time business.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Calvin Edgerton    </h5>        <p>      Have you ever wondered what the old books in that attic      trunk are worth? And what about those dusty volumes on the      top shelf of Grandma's pantry?    </p>    <p>      Books such as these just might bring in a tidy little sum.      During my first year of college, while working in a public      library, I became interested in old books-and in the      market that exists for them. I discovered that getting the      right book to the right person can be a profitable venture.      And ever since, I've been making money in my spare time      buying and selling old, rare, and out-of-print books to      secondhand-book dealers-who, in turn, sell them to      collectors, scholars, and people interested in reading on      specific topics.    </p>    <p>      If you, too, have a fascination for old books, and if you      have a bit of detective in you, you may have the makings      for a profitable part-time home business. But first, you      need to know what makes books valuable and who's willing to      pay cash for them.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT MAKES BOOKS VALUABLE?    </h3>    <p>      When you're talking in terms of collector-quality volumes,      you can eliminate several categories right away: textbooks,      old Bibles (they have sentimental value only), modern      mass-market paperbacks, and book club selections. The      latter are produced in such great quantities and with such      inexpensive materials that most aren't worth more than a      nickel or dime each, no matter where you buy or sell them      (and no matter what some dealers may charge for them). A      large number of such books might bring in a few dollars,      but don't count on it.    </p>    <p>      Also, remember that just because a book is old, doesn't      mean that it's valuable. Many books over 100 years old may      be worth only 10e, while one that's less than 20 years old      can cost over $50. A book becomes valuable not because of      its age (except, of course, for those that are      <em>hundreds</em> of years old) but because of who wrote      the book and what it's all about.    </p>    <p>      A famous author (such as Hemingway, Poe, Twain, Bellow, or      Dickinson) can make a book valuable. A book that's the      first of its kind is also worth money (Newton's book on      gravity, Freud's first psychology book, a book on atomic      energy published in the late 1930's, etc.), as are special,      limited, or first editions. An author's signature on the      flyleaf, the fact that a volume may have local or regional      interest, and other such factors also determine the value      of a secondhand book to collectors.    </p>    <p>      The volumes I deal with have a retail value of at least      $3.00 or $4.00. And while these books aren't as plentiful      as paperbacks or book club editions, they can still be      found in large enough quantities to give someone like you      an extra income.    </p>    <h3>      A TRADE SECRET    </h3>    <p>      I've found that if I become an "expert" in a certain type      of used book and look mainly for ones that fit into my      field of amateur expertise, I'm more likely to find volumes      that I know are worth some money. For example, my      "specialty" is books written by or about the people of      North Carolina, my home state. As a result, I've become      fairly proficient in spotting valuable finds in this field      at flea markets and yard sales. When I add to that my basic      knowledge of the value of old books in general, I'm able to      turn my knowledge into cold, hard cash.    </p>    <p>      To illustrate my point: A copy of the book <em>Characters,      Always Characters,</em> by North Carolinian Carl Goerch,      published in 1945, is worth about $12.00 on today's used      book retail market. I recently found a copy at a library      sale for $1.00 and sold it to a book dealer for $4.00. The      rest of the country may have never heard of Carl Goerch,      but to folks in The Old North State he's a beloved native      son. His book is worthless in California, but here in North      Carolina it meant a $3.00 profit. And even though I don't      come across the same title very often, I can be sure that      when I do, it'll make me some money.    </p>    <p>      You can choose to specialize in any area you wish. Some      subjects I've found to be profitable are family genealogies      (great money-makers in an age of folks searching for their      roots) . . . town, county, and state histories . . .      biographies . . . fiction and poetry (if they're written by      famous people or are first editions) . . . and books      dealing with the general history, development, and settling      of the American continent. The latter category, called      Americana, is a very popular and profitable      area-especially if it's <em>Western</em> Americana.    </p>    <h3>      WHERE TO FIND THEM    </h3>    <p>      Flea markets can be veritable gold mines, although some      flea market dealers, mostly out of ignorance, charge too      much for their book wares.    </p>    <p>      Yard sales, too, usually have some old books, but they are      often the paperback or book club editions. However, if you      do find a good book at a.yard sale-lucky you-it      can usually be purchased for next to nothing.    </p>    <p>      The most promising places I've found for acquiring valuable      old books are secondhand shops, auction houses, and annual      or continuing sales at public libraries. Public library      castoffs are often marred by checkout stamps and card      envelopes and are usually well-worn. These things can      lessen the value of a book, but some library discards (such      as the Carl Goerch book I mentioned) can still be worth      some money.    </p>    <p>      One of the best finds I ever made, though, turned up on a      presale visit to a local auction house, where I came upon a      box of old, moth-eaten, seemingly worthless tomes. I looked      through them anyway, though, and discovered a pre-Civil War      geography book that contained some very colorful maps. The      cover of the book was well-worn and water-stained, but the      inside map pages were in very good shape. The book was      dated 1860, and the many-hued illustrations caught my      attention. I remembered from previous reading that an      economical printing press capable of reproducing full color      wasn't perfected until the late 1800's. Before then, color      pictures were hand-painted with water colors one page at a      time. This fact alone makes these books very      valuable-and there I stood, with just such a gem in      my very own hands! I was ecstatic!    </p>    <p>      I offered the owner, who had found the books among some      junk in his barn, $2.00 for the entire box, and after we      bargained for a, minute or two, we settled on $3.00. I then      contacted a local bookdealer who specializes in old maps      and atlases. "You got lucky this time!" he said of the old      geography book, and offered me $30. I accepted. Later he      sold the volume to a collector for $75.    </p>    <p>      The point of this story is not that I got lucky, but that I      knew what I'd found when I found it. Even though I didn't      know the exact value of the book, I knew it was worth more      than the $3.00 I'd have to pay to make it my own.    </p>    <p>      Other places to find books are attics and basements (some      folks may let you have the books free just for carting them      off), neighbors' junk piles and trash cans (I''ve found      "money books" in dumpsters), and other places where      unwanted volumes accumulate. Remember, your goal is to find      consistent sources for old books and acquire them with as      little investment as possible. One more reminder: Old and      used books are fragile and sensitive things, so take good      care of them. If by chance they don't sell, you can always      read them. That gives them a double value.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO SELL YOUR BOOKS    </h3>    <p>      The best person to sell your wares to is a secondhand-book      dealer (also known as an antiquarian bookseller). A      collector will pay about twice as much as a dealer, but      collectors are difficult to locate-especially those      who'd be <em>most</em> interested in your particular finds.      A dealer, however, has a list of regular customers and some      idea of which collector reads which type of book. He or she      will pay you a fair price based on the current retail      value.    </p>    <p>      To sell your books, therefore, first look in the local      yellow pages (or those of nearby cities) under "Antiquarian      Booksellers." If a dealer's shop is nearby, go there in      person with your books. If not, write to the shop, giving      the information that's printed on the title page of each      volume: title, author, publisher, and date and place of      publication. If there's no date or place on the title page,      simply indicate that fact to the dealer. The best way to      present this and other pertinent facts is to write the      information on an index card-one card for each book      you're selling.    </p>    <p>      You'll also want to note, of course, the <em>condition</em>      of your books, since that factor will ultimately determine      their value. The better the shape they're in, the more      money you'll make.    </p>    <p>      When describing the condition of your books (and be honest      about it, since the dealer is going to see them before      striking a deal anyway), use the following terms:      <em>As</em> <em>new or mint</em> describes a book that's in      the same condition as the day it came off the presses      (these are rare); <em>fine</em> refers to a book that      approaches mint condition but without the original      crispness of a new book (perhaps with some minor small      tears or stains); and <em>very good</em> is one that shows      small signs of wear but isn't torn and has no serious      defects. <em>Good</em> describes a book that shows average      wear and use, but with all pages intact and the binding in      good shape; <em>fair</em> represents a well-worn copy that      may be missing endpapers or other blank pages of no      importance to the text (possibly with a loose binding and      tears and stains and lots of shelf wear); and <em>poor</em>      means the book is useful as a reading copy (in fact, you      may want to simply designate it as a reading copy to the      dealer). In the latter case, the book usually has no      covers, the pages are worn and torn (and a few may be      missing), but the text is complete enough to read. Any book      in worse shape than the conditions described above won't      sell.    </p>    <p>      Once you've made a card for each book you have to offer,      send the cards <em>(not</em> the books) to the      dealer-but don't expect to be told how much your      books are worth just on the basis of the information you've      provided. First of all, such an estimate is impossible to      make based solely on that data. And second, such a request      amounts to an appraisal, a service for which most dealers      will charge a fee.    </p>    <p>      If the dealer is interested in buying your books, he or she      will ask to see them, either by mail or in person, for      further inspection. I prefer, when possible, to make a      personal visit, as it gives me an opportunity to meet the      dealer and make friends.    </p>    <p>      After seeing your books, a dealer will make an offer on the      whole lot or on just the ones he or she wants. You can      either accept or reject the offer. There's not much room      for bargaining in the secondhand book business,      but-as already mentioned-most dealers will give      you a fair price.    </p>    <h3>      INFORMATION SOURCES    </h3>    <p>      The best place to find current prices for certain books is      dealers' catalogs. Most old-book dealers issue these      periodically, and they can be a gold mine of information.      Even if the books you have aren't listed, you can still get      some idea of what your books are worth by looking for      listings of similar volumes. Please remember, however, that      the figures in such sources reflect <em>retail</em> prices      based on what individual dealers are asking collectors.      When the dealer buys your books, he or she will give you      around 20%o to 40% of those retail prices. Dealers, you      see, have to make a profit on the books they buy from you,      and sometimes a book will sit on a shelf for a long time      before a buyer comes along. This fact, along with overhead,      plays a part in the amount you'll receive.    </p>    <p>      To get the catalogs, write directly to the dealers. The      publications are usually free, or they can be obtained for      a small fee that is refundable with a purchase. A list of      dealers can be obtained by writing to the Antiquarian      Booksellers of America (50 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY      10020). Be sure to send a self-addressed, stamped (40 cents      postage) envelope for a reply.    </p>    <p>      Old-book dealers who offer catalogs can also be found in      the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> and other      publications about books. Two magazines dealing      specifically with the oldbook trade are <em>AB Bookman's      Week (P.O.</em> Box AB, Clifton, NJ 07015) and <em>American      Book Collector</em> (274 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10016).      These publications contain ads from old-book dealers as      well as articles, editorials, and other features of      interest.    </p>    <p>      One of the most informative works in the old-book field is      Van- Allen Bradley's <em>The Book Collectors' Handbook of      Values;</em> unfortunately it's out of print, but you might      be able to find it on your local public library's reference      shelves. The volume lists over 17,000 books and their      worth. Also, Bradley's series, Gold <em>in Your Attic</em>      and <em>More</em> <em>Gold in</em> <em>Your Attic</em>      (alas, also out of print), is very interesting and helpful      to the beginner who wants to learn about book collecting in      general.    </p>    <p>      Other price guides include <em>American Book Prices      Current,</em> by the American Book Publisher Record, and      <em>The Official Price Guide to</em> Old <em>Books and      Autographs,</em> by William Rodger, published by House of      Collectibles in Orlando, Florida. For paperbacks (vintage      collectors' editions) the best price guides are those      written by Kevin Hancer and published by Borgo Press (P.O.      Box 2845, San Bernardino, CA 92406).    </p>    <h3>      THE BOTTOM LINE    </h3>    <p>      How much money can you expect to make by selling old books?      Well, here's an example: I recently carried about 100 books      60 miles to a dealer I'd worked with before. After looking      over my candidates for the better part of an hour, he      offered me $225 for the entire lot. I had spent about a      month (at odd times) digging up these books and had paid an      average of 30 cents each for them-so naturally I      accepted his offer. Just a few hours' work, a $30      investment, and about $4.00 for gas had earned me a profit      of $191!    </p>    <p>      The amount of money you make depends on how much time      you're willing to spend on this book business. If you      really work at it as a part-time venture, you might earn      $200 a month or more. Most of the time, however, your      profits will be less than that. Ultimately, the most      important determining factor is you.    </p>    <p>      The old-book business requires a small investment of time      and money, and you need to develop and constantly hone a      specialized knowledge of the field. But if, like me, you're      a bookworm anyway, then you'll find that the advantages far      outweigh any disadvantages. If you're diligent and willing      to lift a few heavy boxes, you <em>can</em> cash in on the      thrill of hunting, finding, and selling secondhand books.    </p>
