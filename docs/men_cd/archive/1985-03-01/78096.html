    <p>
                        <p>      If you've been caught in the old eight-hours-a-day grind      for the last couple of decades, self-employment may sound      like paradise. But of course there are responsibilities      that go along with being out on your own. When you start      your own business, you alone will be responsible for the      paperwork that a big business pays a whole staff of      accountants and bookkeepers to do. And, at least for the      time being, you probably won't be able to afford full-time      professional assistance. When you're at the helm, taxes are      no longer an <em>annual</em> bother; they pop up at least      <em>every three months.</em>    </p>    <h3>      ARE YOU SELF-EMPLOYED?    </h3>    <p>      Most trade, business, or sideline income, other than wages,      is considered to be self-employment by the IRS. Exceptions      to this include dividends and interest, capital gains, and      rent from real estate for which you aren't a dealer and      don't provide services to occupants (hotels, apartment      buildings, etc., <em>do</em> produce self-employment      income). If your self-employment income exceeds $400 per      year, you're responsible for reporting it to the IRS as a      self-employed person.    </p>    <h3>      IS IT A BUSINESS OR HOBBY?    </h3>    <p>      Demonstrating that you're in business to make a profit is      crucial to your tax treatment by the IRS. If the IRS      decides you're simply practicing a hobby, you'll not be      allowed to deduct expenses that exceed income, you won't be      allowed to deduct portions of bad debts owed to you, and      you won't be able to apply for refund of prior taxes. (See      the section "What if You Lose Your Shirt?") But how do you      prove profit motive?    </p>    <p>      If you make money in two out of the first five years of      business activity (seven years for raising horses for      racing, breeding, or showing), the IRS will accept that you      are in business to make a profit. If, however, at that      point you fail to have had two profitable years, the IRS      will disallow losses retroactively . . . you'll have to pay      back any loss deductions you claimed in previous years,      unless you can prove profit motive in a different way.    </p>    <p>      For example, you may still be able to deduct net      losses-even without making a profit in two of five      years-if you can demonstrate that you carried on in a      businesslike manner (capable bookkeeping and management);      had expertise in the activity; spent time and effort      attempting to make a profit; had assets that were expected      to appreciate in value; had been successful in similar      ventures; had an expectation that such a business would be      profitable; weren't openly attempting to shield other      income; and/or weren't engaged in an activity from which      you derived primarily recreational or pleasure benefit.    </p>    <h3>      YOU-NOT YOU, INC.    </h3>    <p>      A thorough explanation of farming, partnership, or      corporate taxes is simply beyond the ken of a humble      article such as this. Therefore, the following information      is geared toward the simpler form of doing business: sole      proprietorship. A proprietor is personally responsible for      his or her business's finances.    </p>    <h3>      THE TAX RESPONSIBILITIES OF SELF-EMPLOYMENT    </h3>    <p>      Though filing taxes for a sole proprietorship is simple      compared to the bookkeeping expected of a partnership or      corporation, you still may have to file the following      returns or information forms with the IRS:    </p>    <p>      * Schedule C is where you report your profit or loss from a      business or profession as a sole proprietor. Earned income,      for which you may receive Form 1099 from the organization      that paid you, must be listed here, along with the expenses      incurred in generating that income. Schedule C allows you      to deduct many miscellaneous expenses that a W-2 employee      would be able to take only if he or she itemized      deductions. For example, if you hold equipment or tools for      performing your job, you may depreciate them on Schedule C      (along with Form 4562). If you divide the use of equipment      between self-employment and a W-2 job, first year expensing      and depreciation must be appropriately allocated. If you      don't itemize, you lose the deduction for the portion of      the use that is for your W-2 employment.    </p>    <p>      * Schedule SE (self-employment) must be filed by all      taxpayers who earn more than $400 through self-employment      and have an earned income of less than $37,800. It requires      you to pay social security tax.    </p>    <p>      * 1040-ES (estimated tax): This is the self-employed      person's version of withholding, and it must be filed      <em>quarterly-</em> along with the appropriate funds.      The penalty for underpayment of estimated tax in 1984 is      calculated on Form 2210 (which also contains exceptions to      these and other rules). If you fail to file Form 2210, the      IRS will calculate the penalty, which will almost always be      greater than the amount figured on 2210. Form 1040-ES must      also be filed by any taxpayer who will owe the government      more than $400 on Form 1040 ("Amount You Owe," line 68).      See Publication 505 for more information on estimated tax.    </p>    <p>      * 940 and 941: If you have any employees, you must pay FUTA      (unemployment compensation) and FICA (social security)      taxes and report quarterly. However, if the liability for      FUTA amounts to less than $100 per year, you can file 940      just once per year by January 31.    </p>    <p>      * W-2 forms reporting income of all employees must be given      to employees by January 31 and filed with the IRS by      February 28.    </p>    <p>      * Information returns: If you pay more than $600 in      interest to an individual, you must file Form 1099-INT. If,      in the course of business, you pay more than $600 to an      individual for rent (other than to a real estate agent),      royalties, fees, or commissions, or to an individual or      corporation for medical or health care, you. must file Form      1099-MISC. In addition, you must file Form 1096, summary      and transmittal of information returns, along with the      1099's. These forms must be filed on or before February 28      in the year after which the payments were made.    </p>    <p>      * Excise taxes: If you engage in certain activities-such as      manufacturing or selling bows and arrows, or dispensing      gasoline-you may have to collect excise taxes from      customers and pay them to the IRS. See Publication 334 for      details, including a list of activities that require      collection of excise taxes.    </p>    <h3>      THE TAX ADVANTAGES OF SELF-EMPLOYMENT    </h3>    <p>      From a tax standpoint, the main advantage of      self-employment is that it allows you to more thoroughly      wed your personal and business lives. More of your everyday      activities become deductible because so much of your time      is spent, in business-related activity. (Some writers have      dreamed that their entire cost of living might be      deductible, since their experience is their work. The IRS      has not approved such an approach.)    </p>    <p>      For example, you may decide to conduct business from your      home. You'll need an office to work in, so you can set      aside a portion of your household and deduct the expenses      for that area as a business activity. (See the sidebar on      home offices for more information.) You'll probably also be      using your personal vehicle for business, so a portion of      that expense will be deductible. The tools, materials, and      supplies of a trade or profession are examples of more      deductions taken by the self-employed.    </p>    <p>      You may be able to take advantage of renewable energy tax      credits for energy equipment you install at your business.      The percentages are considerably lower than those for      residential provisions, but depreciation may also be taken.      Furthermore, hydropower retrofitted to existing dams is      included in the business energy tax credit code. To take      renewable energy or renewable energy and investment tax      credits, use Form 3468.    </p>    <p>      Owners of businesses may also offer themselves, as      employees, health and life insurance policies as fringe      benefits-just as employees of big businesses are      provided with such perks. A major restriction, however, is      that there are complicated rules concerning discrimination      against employees by owners . . . you generally can't give      yourself substantially better benefits than you provide for      all full-time employees.    </p>    <p>      One potentially major advantage for self-employed people is      that they may set up highly beneficial retirement plans      (again, as long as all full-time employees are included).      The contributions to and earnings of such plans are      tax-deferred; that is, the money isn't taxable as income      until the benefits are distributed at retirement. As a      self-employed person, you may defer taxes on substantially      more income than is allowed by employee Individual      Retirement Accounts (IRA's)-in some cases, mote than      $100,000 per year. Additionally, your investment      opportunities are much greater with a self-employment      retirement account. See Publication 560 for more      information.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT IF YOU LOSE YOUR SHIRT?    </h3>    <p>      If your adjusted gross income is negative, you stand an      excellent chance of getting money back from tax paid in      previous years-plus interest! To get your money back,      file an amended return, using Form 1045 (quick refund      claim). Double-check the 1045 before mailing it in, because      if it contains any mistakes, it will be returned      immediately without any further action.    </p>    <p>      Since your net operating loss will reduce your previous      year's income, you may be able to get additional money back      by filing Form 1040X with an attached Schedule G (income      averaging).    </p>    <h3>      A FINAL NOTE    </h3>        <p>      We're not encouraging you to set up a small self-employment      business merely to dodge taxes, but it will behoove you to      pay heed to the tax effects of being your own boss. Pay      careful attention to the type of business you're setting up      and the location from which you'll work. (If your      self-employment is a second income, see the discussion of      tax home in "Off to Two Mines" for an inkling of the      importance of your principal place of business.) The tax      code has, at least in theory, a number of provisions that      were designed to encourage small businesses, and they may      help you make a go of your new venture-if, that is,      you don't get buried in the paperwork first.    </p>
