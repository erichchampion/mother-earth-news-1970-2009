    <p>
                        <p>      One spoof of income tax is a form with three lines. The      first says, "How much money did you make last year?" The      second says, "How much did it cost to earn it?" The last      says, "Send in the difference." This, of course, is      inaccurate from the word go, because you already sent much      of it in-in the form of withholding from your      paycheck. But actually, the satirical form describes pretty      accurately the process of filing taxes. You need to know      [1] how much you earned (gross income) . . . [2] how much      you spent getting there: your income adjustments and      deductions (either itemized or according to Uncle Sam's      standard deduction, whichever is greater) . . . [3] the      amount of tax imposed on the remainder when [2] is      subtracted from [1] . . . and [4] the amount of any credits      that can be taken from that tax.    </p>    <p>      Working for one employer doesn't give you a wide range of      tax options, but a review of the basic process involved in      filing in this situation will give you the groundwork you      need to move on to the more involved tax situations we'll      be discussing later. If you choose to itemize your      deductions (by filing Schedule A), you'll be allowed to      include a broad range of business-related expenses as      deductions, in addition to non business itemized      deductions. Unless you own a home and are paying interest      on a mortgage, however, you probably won't have enough      expenses to justify itemizing. The standard deduction, now      called the zero bracket amount, may prove to be more to      your advantage. Thus you'll be filing the standard      1040-perhaps with a couple of other explanatory      forms.    </p>    <h3>      HOW MUCH YOU EARNED    </h3>    <p>      For tax purposes, you have two lives: your personal and      business ones. And when you work at a regular job for a      salary, from which your employer withholds income tax      prepayments throughout the year, the majority of your      income is likely to be from that job (your business life)      as reflected in one form: the W-2. But receiving a W-2      certainly doesn't mean that employment is your sole source      of income. Beyond the standard supplementary types of      income, such as interest and dividends, some examples of      other sorts of revenue, and the locations on Form 1040      where they must be reported, include the following:    </p>    <p>      <strong>*</strong> Alimony (as opposed to child support)      received must be reported on line 11 of Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Barter income: The exchange of goods or      services for other goods or services must be reported on      line 22 of Form 1040 if they aren't related to your trade      or business. If you are self-employed and barter for your      wages, the fair market value of the income must be reported      on Schedule C.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Canceled debts you owed must be reported      as income on line 22, Form 1040. (If you don't believe it,      just ask Geraldine Ferraro.)<br />      <strong>*</strong> Cooperative benefits: If you receive a      discount on goods for services rendered at a cooperative,      this is taxable income. If you receive dividends on your      membership fee from a cooperative, this amount is taxable,      and you should receive Form 1099-PATR in the mail from the      cooperative.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Damages you are awarded for lost wages      or profits, but not those that compensate for personal      injury or sickness (unless those awards are punitive), must      be reported on line 22, Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Foreign income of U.S. citizens is fully      taxable and must be reported on line 7, Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Free tours, even those for which you      serve as an organizer, must be reported as income on line      22, Form 1040. Expenses of voluntary leaders may not be      deducted.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Gain from sale of your home: The amount      you receive when you sell your home (minus expenses of      sale), less the price you paid for your house added to the      cost of improvements you've made (the total of which is      called your basis), is taxable as a capital gain and must      be reported on Schedule D. Thus, keeping good records of      improvements you make to your house is quite important. An      excess of improvements isn't helpful, though: If you sell      your house for less than your basis, the loss isn't      deductible (unless you turn your home into a rental house      before selling it-see Publications 523 and 527 for      rules).    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, even if you have a substantial gain, you can      postpone taxes on that amount by reinvesting the basis and      gain in a new principal residence. It's important to      understand that you'll only be postponing the inevitable,      however. The basis of your new home will be reduced by the      amount of gain you reinvest (and defer taxes on), so that      when you sell that home, the "new" taxable gain will      include the amount you postponed earlier. You may not      postpone the gain on any part of your home used for      business during the year of sale. But you can choose to      exclude up to $125,000 in gain from the sale of your      principal residence if you are 55 or older, have used the      home as your principal residence for three of the last five      years, and have not excluded gain on a sale or exchange of      a home after July 26, 1978.    </p>    <p>      <strong>*</strong> Gambling winnings must be reported on      line 22 of Form 1040. Losses may be deducted on Schedule A      up to the extent of winnings.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Hobby income should be reported on line      22 of 1040. Expenses may be deducted, but only to the      extent of income.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Refunds you have received on state or      local taxes that were deducted in previous years should be      reported on line 10, Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> In some cases, per diem expenses from      your employer in excess of $44 per day must be reported as      income on line 7, Form 1040. Attach an explanation.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Sales of personal items, as well as      investment property, at a profit should be reported as      capital gains on Schedule D. If the items are not      considered investments, losses may not be deducted; items      such as gold, coins, and gems are generally considered      investments, and a sale at a value greater or less than the      purchase price is treated as either a capital gain or loss.      <strong><br />      *</strong> Solar energy grants received from your state      under the Solar Hot Water Initiative Program must be      reported on line 22 (you may also qualify for a renewable      energy tax credit, however).    </p>    <h3>      SPECIAL ITEMS FOR WHICH YOU SHOULD RECEIVE<br />      (AND MUST SUBMIT) 1099 OR W-2 EARNINGS STATEMENTS    </h3>    <p>      <strong>*</strong> Annuities or pensions: Payments received      from an employer pension plan must be reported on line 16      or 17a and b, Form 1040. Distributions from Individual      Retirement Accounts must be reported on line 17a of 1040,      unless certain penalties apply. See Publication 590.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Awards: All prizes and      awards-except certain ones that are made in      recognition of achievement, that were not applied for, and      that imply no future services-should be reported on line      22, Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Group life insurance premiums paid by      your employer on a policy that exceeds $50,000 are reported      on line 7 of Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Stock options: Some stock options must      be reported on line 7, Form 1040. See IRS Publication      525.<br />      <strong>*</strong> All unemployment benefits must be      reported on line 20a, and they may be taxable. Receiving      such benefits may also force you to make estimated tax      payments during the year. See IRS Publication 505.    </p>    <p>      Further elaboration on what is and isn't taxable income can      be found in IRS Publications 17 and 525.    </p>    <h3>      DEDUCTIONS AVAILABLE TO ALL    </h3>    <p>      The following items are some of the expenses that can be      deducted from gross income whether or not you itemize      deductions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>*</strong> Alimony paid: Report this amount on line      29, Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Business travel: Necessary expenses      incurred while traveling away from home on your employer's      behalf (but not paid by the employer) for a period long      enough to require sleep or rest are deductible. You may      claim these amounts by filing Form 2106. You may claim      mileage for which your car was put to business use (except      for commuting) at a rate of 20.5 cents per mile for the      first 15,000 miles and 11 cents per mile thereafter, or you      may calculate actual expenses. Actual expenses may include      depreciation (see the glossary and IRS Publication 572).      You may also deduct travel expenses for traveling to and      attending school required by your employer or necessary to      improve or maintain skills used in your present work. When      figuring travel expenses, don't forget auto club dues,      garage rent, parking fees, tolls, etc. See Publication 463      for record-keeping requirements.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Contributions to qualifying charitable      organizations may be deducted up to a limit of 25% of the      first $300 if you don't itemize. Report this amount on line      34b of Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Convention expenses incurred to further      your employer's business, and for which you weren't      compensated, may be deducted as travel expenses on Form      2106. If your spouse or other family members attended with      you, their portion of the expense may not be deducted      unless they actually had specific business duties at the      function.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Married couple with both working: If you      are married, you and your spouse both work, and you file a      joint return, you can exclude 10% of $30,000 or 10% of the      lesser of the spouses' earned incomes-whichever is      smaller-from your taxable income. Figure your      exclusion on Schedule W and report the amount on line 30 of      Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Moving expenses: If you moved your home      to accommodate your employer in a different job location or      to take a new job, and if the new job location is at least      35 miles farther from your former home than the old one      was, and if you work at least 39 weeks of the 12 months      after the move, you may deduct the reasonable expenses of      moving your household goods and personal effects, of      traveling to your new home, of house-hunting trips before      you move, of temporary living in the new area, and of      disposing of your former home and acquiring a new      one-within certain dollar limits. Fill out Form 3903      to determine the moving expense deduction you can report on      line 24 of Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Penalty on early withdrawal of savings:      If you are assessed a penalty for prematurely withdrawing      funds from a time savings account, you may deduct this      penalty on line 28, Form 1040. (Interest payments you      <em>receive</em> must be reported as income on line 8, Form      1040.)<br />      <strong>*</strong> Retirement plan payments: You may deduct      up to $2,000 ($2,250 if married and filing jointly, for      joint accounts with a nonworking spouse) of earned income      for contributions to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)      if you are younger than 70-1/2. Trustee fees may be added.      This deduction is reported on lines 26a and 26b of Form      1040.    </p>    <h3>      The Morass of Depreciation    </h3>    <p>      <em>If you itemize as an employee, are self-employed, or      have rental income, and if you buy property for your trade      or business or for investment that has a useful (and      calculable) life expectancy of greater than one year and      that can be expected to wear out, lose value, or become      obsolete, you may deduct a portion of the cost of that      property each year by filing Form 4562. Report the      deduction on line 22 of Schedule A (if the property is for      the convenience of your employers on Schedule C (if you're      self-employed), or on Schedule E (for rental income). This      property may be tangible (vehicles, equipment, tools,      etc.), intangible (patent rights, copyrights, etc.), or      real estate. Land itself, in spite of what we know about      the rates of soil loss, can never be depreciated.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Reporting all the nuances of depreciation is an      involved enough matter</em> <em>to merit a major article in      itself, but here are a few of the basics. Most</em>      <em>property is now depreciated by the Accelerated Cost      Recovery System</em> <em>(ACRS) as either 3 year property      (cars and light trucks), 5-year property</em> <em>(most      tools and equipment) 10 year property (mobile homes and      certain</em> <em>light-duty structures), or 18-year      property (buildings). The specific percentages of the cost      that may be recovered each year for each type of      property<br /></em> <em>are specified in the instructions      for Form 4562. The full first year percentage may be taken      for all but 18 year property, no matter when the item</em>      <em>was put into service during the tax year. However,      property depreciated</em> <em>under ACRS may not be claimed      for a deduction in the year it's disposed</em> of, <em>no      matter when during the year it's sold. ACRS is figured      against your cost in the item, less 50% of any investment      tax credit that you claim on the item.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Cars, computers, and (possibly) some other business      items as yet unspecified by the IRS that are put into      service after June 18, 1984, must be held at least 50% for      business use in order to qualify for ACRS. Accurate,      itemized daily logs of use are required! In addition, these      items must be required for the convenience of the employer,      " and the IRS has decided that a letter from the employer      isn't sufficient evidence. (Just what proof is sufficient      hasn't been specified by the IRS yet . . . leaving      taxpayers wondering just how to handle this matter.) In      addition, for cars put into service after June 18, 1984, a      $16,000 limit has been placed on the total amount that may      be depreciated by ACRS The amount in excess of $16,000 must      be depreciated by one of several other methods. See IRS      Publication 534 for more information.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Certain property may be "expensed" rather than      depreciated under IRS Code Section 179. You may directly      deduct up to $5,000 (the amount was frozen this year) for      tangible business equipment put in service in 1984. The      item must remain in business service for at least two years      following the tax year; if the property is sold, the      deduction must be recaptured as ordinary income. Selecting      the expensing option prevents you from taking the      investment tax credit or depreciation, so it generally      doesn't result in as great tax benefits over the life of      property, but it may be advantageous for those seeking an      immediate large deduction.</em>    </p>    <h3>      DEDUCTIONS AVAILABLE TO ITEMIZERS ONLY    </h3>    <p>      By filing Schedule A, you may be able to deduct greater      expenses than the standard income exclusion for non      itemizers. The viability of this approach usually depends      on a substantial mortgage interest deduction. The following      deductions are <em>in addition to</em> those listed in the      previous section.    </p>    <p>      <strong>*</strong> Adoption expenses up to $1,500 may be      deducted for children adopted under the Social Security      adoption program for children with special needs. This is      reported on line 22, Schedule A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Bad non-business loans-in other      words, loans that you can't collect on-may be      deducted as short-term capital losses on Schedule D in the      year in which the loans are proved to be worthless. You      must have written evidence that the debt existed and is      uncollectible. Bad business loans to your employer are      fully deductible from gross income on line 22 of Form 1040.      Loans to family members are a tricky matter-for example, if      the IRS judges that the loan was made in an attempt to      transfer income from a person in a high tax bracket to a      person in a lower one, the deduction probably won't be      allowed.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Books: Professional libraries maintained      for use in your employment may be depreciated, as explained      in the sidebar on depreciation.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Business gifts: Gifts less than $25 in      value given to those you do business with (or their spouses      or children) are deductible on line 22 of Schedule A. See      Publication 463 for record-keeping requirements.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Casualty and theft losses: If your      property is stolen, or if it is damaged, destroyed, or lost      because of a "sudden, unexpected, and unusual" identifiable      event, you may deduct the amount for which you were not      compensated by insurance or some other means-after      subtracting $100 per loss and 10% of your adjusted gross      income from the resulting total. The amount of the      deduction is based on fair market value, not replacement      cost.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Club dues may be deducted, with certain      restrictions, when the club is used primarily for business      purposes. See Publication 463 for clarification of      requirements and record keeping.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Contributions to qualifying charitable      organizations may be deducted on Schedule A up to a maximum      of 50% of your adjusted gross income. You may deduct gifts      of property (they must be fully described if valued at      greater than $200; contributions made after 1984 and valued      at greater than $5,000 must be appraised) or cash, and you      may deduct reasonable expenses incurred in service to a      charitable organization (implied compensation for services      is not an allowable deduction). Car expenses in this case      are figured for oil and gas only, or at a standard rate of      9 cents per mile.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Depreciation of property held for use in      your employment: Please see the sidebar on      depreciation.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Dues paid to professional organizations      may be deducted on line 20 of Schedule A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Educational expenses: You may deduct      expenses for tuition, books, supplies, laboratory fees,      tutoring, research, typing, etc., if the education      maintains your present job skills or improves them, as      required by your employer. These expenses are listed on      line 22 of Schedule A, but Form 2106 must also be prepared      to show how the education relates to your business. If      you're self-employed, see the discussion on filing Schedule      C in the section "Digging Your Own Mine:      Self-Employment."<br />      <strong>*</strong> Entertainment: You may deduct ordinary      (not lavish) entertainment costs directly related to or      associated with conducting business, as long as they were      primarily for the furtherance of business, not for personal      or social purposes. These deductions are taken on line 22      of Schedule A. Outside salespersons may deduct      entertainment on Form 1040, line 25, and should report such      expenses on Form 2106. Expenses for entertaining an      out-of-town customer's spouse may be deductible, as may the      entertainment of your spouse if his or her purpose is to      entertain the customer's spouse. See Publication 463 for      record-keeping requirements.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Gambling income losses, only to the      extent of gains reported, may be claimed on line 22,      Schedule A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Hobby losses, only to the extent of      income reported, may be claimed on line 22, Schedule      A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Income tax return preparation costs,      books, counseling, and legal representation in income tax      matters, etc., can be deducted in the year the expense is      incurred. These items are listed on line 21 of Schedule      A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Interest expense: Up to certain limits,      you may deduct the interest you pay on borrowed      money-such as personal loans, mortgages, credit      cards, charge accounts, etc.-on Schedule A. Don't      forget to deduct also any prepayment penalties you may have      incurred. Interest on money used to purchase tax-exempt      securities may not be deducted.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Investment expenses-such as accounting      fees, custodial fees, counseling fees, IRA setup and      administration costs, legal costs, safe deposit box rental,      salary for secretary, bookkeeper, etc., subscriptions to      investment services, and travel costs to look after      investments-may be deducted if the expense is directly      related to maintenance of your investments. Fees for the      purchase or sale of securities, however, are subtracted      from the selling price. Report these expenses on line 22 of      Schedule A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Legal fees related to your production of      income are deductible on Schedule A, line 22.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Looking for a new job in your same      profession is a deductible expense on line 22 of Schedule      A. Likewise, fees paid to an employment agency may also be      deducted on line 22, Schedule A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Medical and dental expenses that are      greater than 5% of your adjusted gross income (see the      glossary) may be deducted on Schedule A. Only prescription      drugs and insulin may be included as medicines. See      Publication 17 for a rather lengthy list of deductible and      nondeductible expenses, but don't forget that for 1984 you      are allowed up to $50 per day for lodging when you travel      to obtain medical care. Car expenses are figured at 9 cents      per mile. Deduct medical examination expenses that are      required to get or keep a job on line 22 of Schedule A;      there is no percentage limit.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Office-in-home: Please see      sidebar.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Phone expenses incurred at your home for      your employer's use, along with an allocation of monthly      service charges, may be deducted on line 22, Schedule      A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Tools and supplies (small items      generally valued at less than $100) that you use in your      work may be deducted as expenses on line 22 of Schedule A.      A briefcase, mechanic's hand tools, and pencils are just a      few examples. More expensive items must be depreciated;      please see the sidebar on that subject.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Taxes: State, local, or foreign income      tax; state and local real property tax and personal      property tax; and general sales tax may be deducted on      Schedule A. You may either take a standard sales tax      deduction from IRS tables or deduct actual taxes paid if      you can document them. A major purchase during the tax year      probably means that you will benefit by figuring the actual      tax paid. Taxes you directly paid on the purchase of a      vehicle (yes, boats are included) or on materials for      building a house (mobile homes too) may be added to the      standard amount of deductible sales tax. Taxes are deducted      on Schedule A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Trade and professional magazine      subscriptions may be deducted on line 22 of Schedule      A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Union dues and expenses are deductible      on line 20 of Schedule A.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Work clothes and uniforms: The cost of      clothing and safety items necessary for your employment      that aren't suitable for everyday wear-as well as      laundering of same may be deducted on line 22, Schedule A.      A union clothing requirement does not make the clothing      deductible.    </p>    <h3>      Using Your Home as an Office    </h3>    <p>      <em>The office-in-home deduction is generally not provided      for people working for an employer, unless the office is      for the convenience of your employer" and "not just      appropriate and helpful." In any event, to claim an      office-in-home deduction, you must use the area "regularly      and exclusively, " and it must be either (a) your principal      place of business or trade, (b) a place to meet clients,      customers, or patients, or (c) a separate building for      trade or business. No personal activities may take place in      this office; rather, the activities must be a trade or      business-not personal investment.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Note the inequity that allows an employee of a company      to use the company's work space to reconcile his or her      personal checkbook, or to keep various personal records,      while the self-employed person can't put the office-in-home      to</em> any <em>personal use. Exclusive use is 100%, not      99.99%: People have lost their entire deductions because      they reconciled their personal checkbooks in their      offices-in-home.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The exclusive-use rule does not apply to registered      day-care centers.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you can qualify according to the restrictions listed      above, you may</em> <em>deduct that portion of your      household expenses that relates to the area used for the      office. This is calculated by figuring the percentage of a      house's square feet in use for business and apportioning      that percentage of taxes, mortgage interest, maintenance,      operating expenses, and depreciation. These deductions must      be reported on Schedule A, C, E (partnership), F (farm      income), or 2106-as is appropriate.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you use a computer in a qualified office-in-home,      you don't have to keep a detailed usage log-as is the usual      requirement-in order to depreciate it using ACRS. Bear in      mind, however, that if your office-in-home is denied, that      log will be required retroactively-so you may want to keep      a log anyway.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Another important consideration, if you claim an      office-in-home</em> , <em>is that you may not defer capital      gains on the portion of the house that is your      office-in-home, if you claim that deduction in the year in      which you sell your home. When you sell, depreciation must      be recaptured, as described in the sidebar on depreciation.      For more information, see Publication 587.</em>    </p>    <h3>      TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE TO ALL    </h3>    <p>      Credits are allowed for certain expenditures whether or not      you itemize deductions. These items reduce your tax      liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis.    </p>    <p>      <strong>*</strong> Campaign contributions may be subtracted      from your tax at a rate of 50%o, up to $50 for individual      filers or $100 on joint returns. Report these amounts on      line 44 of Form 1040. <strong><br />      *</strong> Child and dependent care: Between 20 and 30% of      child care expenses, up to $2,400 per dependent, that you      incurred in order to earn income are credited on line 41 of      Form 1040. Prepare and file Form 2441 to claim this credit.      The total is limited to $4,800.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Earned income credit: If you supply more      than half of the cost of maintaining a household in which      you have children or are a surviving spouse, you may take a      credit equal to 10% of the first $5,000 in earned      income-minus 12.5% of your adjusted gross income      exceeding $6,000. (This is a typically confusing-sounding      IRS formula, but if you work with it awhile, plugging in      the appropriate figures, it begins to make sense. Figuring      taxes is often easier than reading about them!) You may      receive a credit even if no taxes were withheld from your      income during the year. This credit is taken on line 59 of      Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Elderly: See the sidebar "Tax      Considerations for Those Over 65."<br />      <strong>*</strong> Foreign taxes: All or part of the amount      paid in tax to foreign countries may be deducted by filing      Form 1116 and entering the amount of the credit on line 47      of Form 1040.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Investment tax credit: A credit of up to      10% of the cost of tangible property put into service for      your business or trade (limited to $1,000 on cars and light      trucks) may be taken by filing Form 3468 and listing the      amount on line 48, Form 1040. See the sidebar on      depreciation.<br />      <strong>*</strong> Residential energy credit: A credit of      15% of the first $2,000 spent on energy conservation      equipment on existing houses substantially completed before      April 20, 1977, is allowed. Forty percent of the first      $10,000 spent on renewable energy equipment for your      principal residence may be taken as a credit. Both of these      credits are claimed by filing Form 5695 and reporting the      total on line 43 of Form 1040. Conservation items include      insulation for house or water heater, storm windows, caulk,      setback thermostats, energy-efficient parts for furnaces,      and energy monitoring devices. Heat pumps, woodstoves, and      hydrogen-burning equipment are not included. Renewable      energy sources include active solar heating equipment and      portions of some passive features, photovoltaic panels,      wind-powered generators, and high-temperature geothermal      equipment. Unfortunately, hydropower and groundwater heat      pumps aren't included.    </p>    <p>      These are the basic building blocks for preparing your      income tax return. Now that you've read through them      quickly, go back and place a small check mark next to each      area you need to investigate further. Then move on either      to a sidebar covering that tax matter or to request the      appropriate paperwork from your regional IRS form center      (the addresses are listed in an accompanying sidebar).    </p>    <h3>      Tax Considerations for Those Over 65    </h3>    <p>      Many requirements, deductions, and credits are different      for those who are over 65. First of all, you need not file      a return at all if you're single and your income is less      than $4,300; if you're married, one of you is over 65, and      your income is less than $6,400; or if your income is less      than $7,400 and you're both over 65. Unless, that is:    </p>    <p>      <strong>*</strong> You had self-employment income exceeding      $400.<br />      <strong>*</strong> You can benefit by filing as a      qualifying widow or widower (see Publication 17), in which      case the limit is $5,400.<br />      <strong>*</strong> You could be claimed as a dependent by      another taxpayer and had unearned income (say, from      investments) of $1,000 or more.<br />      <strong>*</strong> You receive distributions from an      Individual Retirement Account.    </p>    <p>      Gruesome as it may seem, dying doesn't exempt you from      filing. The surviving spouse or the legal executor,      administrator, etc., must file in the year of a taxpayer's      death if that person would have been required to file. On      the other hand, joint returns maybe filed by the surviving      spouse with dependent children for two years after the year      of death. Additionally, the estate will probably file a      return for the year of death on any earnings during      probate.    </p>    <p>      On lines 6a and b of Form 1040, you may take an additional      personal exemption for yourself and/or your spouse if you      are over 65. The additional exemption may not be claimed by      someone reporting you as a dependent.    </p>    <p>      If your gross income is less than $17,500 (unmarried,      filing single), $20,000 (filing joint with one spouse under      65), of $25,000 (if you're both 65 or older), you may      qualify for the Credit for the Elderly. (Note: This credit      is also available to some people under 65. See general      instructions for Form 1040 or Publication 17.) To determine      what your credit is, file Schedule R.    </p>    <h3>      A FEW TAX TIPS    </h3>    <p>      If, when you retire, you receive a lump sum distribution or      a large retirement bonus, consider prepaying charitable and      political contributions, medical expenses, and other      Schedule A items, so that you can take large deductions in      the year in which you receive the lump sum. For example,      you might arrange to pay your doctor in advance for medical      expenses you expect to have in the next year. Take note,      however, that there are limitations on how far in advance      you can prepay many items . . . you may want to consult a      tax pro for this.    </p>    <p>      In addition, if you receive a lump sum distribution upon      retirement, consider ten-year income averaging, a special      provision for this situation. Get a copy of Form 4972 to      look into ten-year averaging's possibilities. Other options      to consider for this situation are capital gains treatment      (see the glossary) and tax-free rollover into an IRA. Now      that you're retired, perhaps you'll have time to work out      these options to your best advantage.    </p>    <p>      Remember to add social security and other nontaxable income      to your available income, line 33-Form      1040-when figuring your sales tax deduction on      Schedule A.    </p>    <h3>      Income Averaging    </h3>    <p>      <em>If your income increases significantly from one year to      the next-particularly if the good year follows three lean      ones-you may benefit from income averaging, which, in      effect, allows you to spread out your taxable income over      the years involved. Here's how you qualify.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>First, you must be a citizen or resident alien. Second,      you may not average if you or your spouse provided less      than 50% of your support during 1981, 1982, and 1983,      unless (a) you were 25 or older at the close of 1984 and      weren't a full-time student during four of the taxable      years after you reached 21; (b) more than 50% of your 1984      income came from work performed in 1981, 1982, and/or 1983;      (c) your spouse's earnings were less than 25% of your joint      1984 income and you were self-supporting in 1981, 1982, and      1983. Owner-employees and key employees may not average      premature distributions from retirement plans. Publication      506 outlines other requirements and adjustments for income      averaging.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Once you've determined that you qualify to attempt to      income average, you'll need to figure out if it's actually      to your</em> advantage <em>to average. Follow the      instructions on Schedule G very carefully, bearing in mind      that this is one of the most mistake-ridden forms submitted      to the IRS. If you do it correctly, buy yourself a      treat!</em>    </p>
