                <p>      <em>This tree-once a favorite of American      settlers-deserves a look from modern-day      homesteaders</em>    </p>          <h5 id="byline">by Dave Wayman    </h5>        <p>      "Good fences make good neighbors," wrote poet Robert Frost.      But what, exactly, makes a good fence?    </p>    <p>      If you've ever had the dubious pleasure of putting a fence      up-of cutting, splitting, and setting posts and      stretching wire-you just might answer, "A fence that      builds itself." And since you're fantasizing, you might      add, . . . and takes care of itself, too."    </p>    <p>      Well, believe it or not, there is such a fence. Chances are      you've seen one while driving along rural roads and looking      out over neat hedgerow-lined fields. During the latter half      of the nineteenth century and the first few decades of this      one-up until the time barbed wire became widely available      and inexpensive-settlers and farmers throughout much      of the eastern half of the United States <em>planted</em>      their fences.    </p>    <p>      More often than not, the tree they used was Osage orange,      sometimes also called prairie hedge, hedge apple, horse      apple, bowwood, or yellow-wood. Most folks today, though,      know it only for its distinctly ugly, almost      otherworldly-looking fruit: an inedible, fleshy green orb      the size <em>of</em> a grapefruit or large orange, with a      warty, furrowed surface sparsely covered with long, coarse      hairs. When you break the globe open, it exudes a bitter,      milky, sticky sap that eventually turns black and that      gives some people an irritating rash.    </p>    <p>      But beauty, after all, is in the eye <em>of</em> the      beholder, and any homesteader who places greater value on      usefulness than on appearance will find much, to admire in      the Osage orange.    </p>    <h3>      AN EXTRAORDINARY TREE    </h3>    <p>      Osage <em>(Maclura pomifera) is</em> the sole surviving      member <em>of</em> the genus <em>Maclura-of</em> its      many relatives from past geologic eras, only fossils      remain. It is also, however, a member of the family      Moraceae, which encompasses the mulberries and the figs, as      well as a large number of tropical and semitropical trees.    </p>    <p>      When mature, the Osage orange measures from 10 to 50 feet      tall and has a trunk 1 to 2 feet in diameter. Its branches      form an even, round crown, unless the trees are growing      closely together in a hedge and don't have room to spread      naturally. Between May and July, the species sports tiny      greenish flowers.    </p>    <p>      Other distinguishing characteristics of the Osage orange      include deeply furrowed, braidedlooking, dark orange bark      ... long (3"-5"), shiny, egg-shaped, dark green leaves,      which are pointed at one end . . . and (perhaps most      significantly) many sharp, steel strong thorns that make      this tree a formidable barrier, to say the least.    </p>    <p>      But Osage orange's value extends well beyond its use as a      living hedge.    </p>    <h3>      A TREE WITH A PAST    </h3>    <p>      When early French settlers ventured west of the Mississippi      River-into what is now eastern Texas and Oklahoma and      western Arkansas-they encountered the Osage Indians,      who were known far and wide for making bows that were      superior weapons for fighting and hunting. The unusual tree      that the Osage used for making their bows was unknown to      the French, who promptly dubbed it bois <em>d'arc,</em> or      "wood of the bow." Later pioneers corrupted the name to      bowdark, and eventually came to call it bowwood.    </p>    <p>      In fact, it didn't take the early pioneers long to      acknowledge that Osage orange was a valuable timber      resource. Because of its great strength and durability, the      settlers used the newly discovered tree in nearly every      application that required a tough, tenacious wood.    </p>    <p>      The hubs and rims of the wheels on farm wagons, covered      wagons, and chuck wagons were made from Osage. Its great      strength enabled it to bear heavy loads, while its      flexibility made it relatively easy to bend into the circle      of a wheel rim and also gave it the capacity to absorb      shock without cracking or splitting. Those properties,      added to the wood's ability to resist the effects of soil      and moisture, made for high-mileage wheel rims.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the wood's extraordinary ability to resist      rot also put the tree in great demand, causing the huge      native stands of Osage orange growing in the bottomlands      <em>of</em> Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to be harvested      wholesale for use as fence posts and railroad ties. Osage      orange might have ended up being a very rare sight for most      Americans were it not for its suitability as a hedge. The      plant met all of the qualifications: It was "horse-high,      bull-strong, and pig-tight." The tree was easily propagated      from seed, and grew fast. In a few years, it would form a      hedge almost tight enough to hold water. Any spaces between      the trees would be screened by the Osage's thick, thorny      branches. And since the trees propagate by sending up      shoots from their roots, all the holes would eventually      fill in with new trees.    </p>    <p>      If planted close together, Osages would grow only to about      20 or 30 feet, never attaining the height of most deciduous      trees. Consequently, they made perfect field borders: They      could contain livestock without shading crops excessively.      Besides, it was a lot easier to plant trees in lines around      fields and pastures than it was to erect and maintain rail      or stockade fences.    </p>    <p>      As a result, thousands of miles of Osage hedges were      planted in the Midwest, East, and South, far beyond the      original range of the species. The tree was hardy and      adapted well to new surroundings, and today it can be found      growing (mostly in hedges) from the Great Plains to the      Eastern Seaboard, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of      Mexico.    </p>    <p>      Although not commmonly used for fencing anymore (some      people claimed that, once established, the trees were hard      to control and that their thorns sometimes injured      livestock), the stands of Osage planted fifty to a hundred      years ago remain a valuable resource. Some farmers still      utilize them as natural enclosures, and many more use the      trees for making exceptionally long-lasting fence posts.      Crafts people-woodworkers and those who make and use      natural dyes-hold the Osage orange in high esteem. And,      perhaps most important, the trees serve as windbreaks and      as badly needed cover for wildlife.    </p>    <p>      If Frost was right in saying that "good fences make good      neighbors," then the Osage is truly remarkable . . .      because it is both a good fence <em>and</em> a good      neighbor, to man and beast alike.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Although it is very hardy, Osage orange does      require a good, deep topsoil. Seeds are available from the      F. W. Schumacher Company, Sandwich, MA 02563, 617/888-0659.      Seedlings can be ordered from Musser Forests, Inc., P.O.
