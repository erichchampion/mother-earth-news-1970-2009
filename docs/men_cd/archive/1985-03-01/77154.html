                    <p>      <em>Conventional publishing wisdom claims that it's a      mistake to run poetry in a "consumer" magazine. Although      that may often be true, we're convinced that MOTHERS      readers are the kind of people who look for beauty in the      practical and search out practicality in the beautiful . .      . and who realize that good poetry can be useful as well as      inspiring. In fact, the best of poems can help us recognize      the wonderful-and often wellhidden-similarities      that all humans share . . . and, by doing so, can make each      of us feel a little bit less alone. The poetry included in      this occasional feature-be it brandnew or previously      published, written by a recognized poet or a      first-timer-will be material that, in the eyes of MOTHER's      editors, helps us see ,ourselves in the words of others.      It's that quality, and the fact that the work presented      here will reflect the range of subject areas usually      presented in this magazine, that gave this feature its      name.</em>     </p>     <h3>Avant-Garden</h3>        <p>      Revolutionary tulips pulled a coup d'etat Last night in my      mother's garden. They came up from the      Underground-Young and green, heads full of red. "What      are the neighbors going to think When they see that we're      aiding and abetting?" Maybe they'll put our names on a list      Or throw us out of the garden club. I don't know.    </p>    <p>      Things have already started to change-My mother hung      the laundry on a line today And I ran outside barefoot, in      my housecoat. The woman next door looked at me as though I      were crazy. Some people don't adapt as quickly as others.    </p>    <p>      - Linda Garrow    </p>    <h3>      Eight Mile Ridge</h3>      <p>      The gray, green distance of the hills and between them the      deepening weight of shadow where they come to their waters,      the hundred creeks and runs, the million stones and      rushes.<br />      <br />      Where they come to their waters come the hidden lives of      hoof and feather, claw and antler, from burrow and nest,      glade-rest and den. Where they come to their waters they      come by the ancient signals, by silence and night, by      sun-beat and season, in travel and migration, in heat and      hunting.<br />      <br />      But from here, only trees and the maze of hills all      green-yellow in clear noon. Only trees: oak, ash, and      lifting from a deep cove the tall cones of poplar. Only      trees, except where cut deep in shade some hollow has      earned a name: Hot, Lost, Painter, Grave.    </p>    <p>      Where they come to their waters is a hidden place, sun a      shattered star in sea of leaves. Where they come to their      waters. the night is alive and navigable by their language      of hunger and song. But now, from here, only trees and      distance, the distance by which I can only guess where they      come, hidden by only trees, only hills, and this, the only      world there used to be.    </p>    <p>      -Marc Harshman    </p>    <p>      Originally published by State Street Press in Turning Out      the Stones, by Marc Harshman, and reprinted by permission      of the poet.</p>      <h3>The Turtle's Heart</h3>        <p>      Helen I was just in there telling Bob that I caught a      turtle up to my place yesterday and I took it over to Laura      to see if she didn't want it but she said she didn't have      time to butcher it out and you know I don't think she's      been feeling right up to it here this fall anyway Helen so      she told me to take it up to Fraken's but I was saying to      Bob ain't it something how you can cut that turtle's heart      right out and throw it over in the corner and come back in      ten hours and it'll still be beating away just as strong      and why couldn't they put a heart like that in a fellow      anyway Helen? you know somebody ought to tell these doctors      that are all the time doing these transplants on people      like they did this fellow last year that they ought to get      a heart like that turtle's heart that'll keep on beating      for ten hours even after it's been cut out and wouldn't      that be something Helen? wouldn't that be some kind of a      heart to put in a fellow anyway?    </p>    <p>      -Daniel J.
