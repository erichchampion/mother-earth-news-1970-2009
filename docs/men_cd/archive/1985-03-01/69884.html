                <p>      For guaranteed lunch and dinnertime delights this year,      take a hint from the French and . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Janet H. Sanchez    </h5>        <p>      The markets of Provence in the sunny southeast of France      offer the makings for a very special salad, known locally      as <em>mesclun.</em> Though the specific combination of      greens contained in mesclun varies with season and      gardener, the mix always includes several varieties of      tender young lettuce plus an array of spicy greens and      herbs such as curly endive, leaf chicory, dandelion, corn      salad, and the leaves of rocket, chervil, and cress.    </p>    <p>      That's in France. On <em>this</em> side of the Atlantic our      not-so-quaint supermarkets rarely offer anything even      <em>approaching</em> an elegant selection of lettuce that's      still young and tender. What's more, your friendly Sooper      Dooper produce manager probably hasn't even <em>heard</em>      of many of the other standard mesclun ingredients.    </p>    <p>      Ah, but that's where one of the rewards of being a home      gardener comes in: Since seed for all the mesclun greens is      available through mail-order seed houses, and since there      is absolutely nothing tricky about sowing and growing them,      you can easily and inexpensively duplicate a bit of the      dining elegance of France by <em>planting</em> a premixed      salad garden.    </p>    <p>      Here's how . . .    </p>    <h3>      MIX AND MATCH, NATCH!    </h3>    <p>      A big part of the fun of growing mesclun is choosing the      varieties of greens you want and then mixing the seed in      experimental proportions for planting. Try several      combinations of ingredients; the difference in the flavor      of the resulting salads will both surprise and delight you.      (When mixing the seed, the measurements don't have to be      precise; I use the "pinch of this and pinch of that" system      and have always obtained excellent results.)    </p>    <p>      A basic mesclun mix could include as few as four varieties      of greens and herbs . . . such as a mix composed of two      parts each of curly endive and oak leaf lettuce, combined      with one part each of chervil and rocket. Or, if you like      to live dangerously, try shooting the works with a mixture      of seed chosen from any-or all-of the popular      mesclun ingredients.    </p>    <p>      LETTUCE. To achieve diversity in color and texture, choose      two or three of the following:    </p>    <p>      <em>Oak leaf</em> lettuce is probably the most traditional      of all mesclun ingredients. It's not only delicious, but      also pretty.    </p>    <p>      Black-seeded Simpson or other green, <em>looseleaf</em>      varieties of lettuce are often included.    </p>    <p>      Ruby, Merveille des Quatre Saisons, or any other variety of      <em>red-leaf</em> lettuce adds an important touch of color      to mesclun.    </p>    <p>      Buttercrunch, Tom Thumb, and other types of <em>Bibb</em>      lettuce contribute tender, lightcolored leaves.    </p>    <p>      Paris White Cos or any <em>romaine</em> lettuce adds a      crunchy texture to salads.    </p>    <p>      GREENS AND HERBS. Choose several varieties from the      following possibilities to insure a tangy, spicy flavor:    </p>    <p>      <em>Green Curled endive</em> is u sually, included in      mesclun for its slightly bitter taste and attractive, lacy      leaves.    </p>    <p>      <em>Corn salad</em> (or <em>mache)</em> has a mild flavor      that provides a subtle backdrop for the more assertive      greens.    </p>    <p>      Sugarhat and other <em>leaf chicories</em> contribute both      tangy taste and firm texture.    </p>    <p>      <em>Dandelion greens</em> are savory if picked when young,      and they contain a bonus of vitamin A.    </p>    <p>      <em>Rocket (</em> or <em>roquette)</em> adds a delicious      peppery flavor to mesclun.    </p>    <p>      <em>Chervil</em> has a piquant, licoricelike taste and      grows well in the shade of the other greens.    </p>    <p>      <em>Garden cress</em> (or <em>peppergrass)</em> imparts a      spicy snap to the salad mixture.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">    <h3>Ordering Mesclun Makings</h3>    <p>      <em>The several varieties of seed needed to grow a      delicious mesclun garden are available from most of the      larger mail-order seed companies. However, if you'd like to      begin your mesclun gardening adventure with a premixed      packet of seed that's guaranteed to produce a firstclass      mixed salad, I recommend Le jardin du Gourmet, West      Danville, VT 05873. Le jardin imparts premixed mesclun from      France, with eleven varieties of greens and herbs included      in each packet. (One packet is sufficient to plant one or      two of the small plots described in the accompanying      article.) Le Jardin is also an excellent source for      individual seed varieties, especially the less well known      French lettuces. The Le Jardin seed catalog is available      for 50 cents, and the mesclun premix is 95 cents per packet      (add 40c postage for orders of less than $3.00; orders of      $3.00 or more will be sent postpaid).</em>    </p>    </div>    <h3>      PLANTING    </h3>    <p>      For the most part, mesclun gardening employs the same      techniques used to grow any of the more common salad      greens, except that with mesclun the seeds are scattered in      wide rows (rather than being sown in a long, thin row) for      ease of harvesting when the plants are young and small.    </p>    <p>      Start by preparing a plot measuring about one by two feet.      After turning the soil, dig in some compost . . . then add      a little cottonseed meal and bonemeal . . . and finally,      rake the area smooth. Now broadcast your mixture of seed      thinly over the plot, and finish the planting by sifting a      1/4" layer of soil over the seed. To assure germination and      rapid growth, it's important to keep the seedbed moist (but      not drenched).    </p>    <h3>      REAPING WHAT YOU SOW    </h3>    <p>      For delicious, tender salads it's vital to pick the greens      when they're very young (lettuce, for example, is "done"      when it's a mere 3" high). Consequently, mesclun      harvesttime comes quickly-only five to six weeks      after planting. The best method for gathering, I've found,      is simply to pull up whole handfuls of the tiny plants,      trim off the roots, wash and dry the leaves, and toss the      clean greens into a salad bowl.    </p>    <p>      The mesclun blend of young lettuce and herbs is so moist      and appetizing that very little dressing is needed; in      fact, it's delicious with no dressing at all. But when I or      mine <em>do</em> want a salad dressing, I use a basic      vinaigrette blend composed of three parts olive oil and one      part wine vinegar.    </p>    <p>      After a few plantings, you'll quickly discover your      favorite mesclun combination. And when the gardening is      done and the salad's on the table, I'm sure that your      family and friends will be as delighted as mine were when I      decided to experiment with this international appetite      delight!    </p>
