                <p><strong>      SUNDAY AFTERNOON</strong>    </p>    		<p><strong>A Sunday afternoon's investment of time can reap    the reward of many quiet days</strong></p>    <p>      When Peggy's son, Keith, was one year old, he was the joy      of his mother's life, except on those occasions when she      had to bring him along to her meetings. Alert, active, and      noisy, he exhausted her until she was ready to fully      endorse the old saying "the only quiet youngster is one      who's sound asleep!"    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, however, a seamstress friend helped solve her      problem by sending Keith a homemade birthday present: a      charming, 10-page booklet that's chock-full of colorful      things to button, zip, tie, stick on, and play      with-quietly. These quiet books cost just pennies to      make, and the idea's merit has been proven by generations      of children who have been entertained by these homemade      books. After carefully studying her son's book, Peggy tried      her hand at making some similar booklets for other      children. Although she's no seamstress, Peggy managed to      fashion some very nice ones with very little trouble.      Here's the format she used:    </p>    <h3>Gather the Basics, Cut, and Fold</h3>        <p>      A quiet book consists of 10 pages (10 double layers of      cloth), each of which is deco rated on both sides. The      "artwork" is either embroidered or appliqued on plain      fabric, and each page contains at least one activity. These      may include: taking pieces off or putting them on, opening      and shutting parts of a design, and lifting flaps. Finally,      some kind of closure (such as tie strings) is usually      provided to hold the booklet shut when not in use.    </p>    <p>      To make one of these books, you'll need about 1 1/2 yards      of 45" sturdy fabric-such as denim, duck, or light      canvas-with a basic background. You'll also need      embroidery thread and needles, some bits and pieces of      colorful cloth, scissors, regular needles and thread (even      easier and more durable if you use a sewing machine), a      fabric-marking pencil, pins, a little bit of stuffing, some      Velcro-brand fastening tape, and lots of notions. Kids love      snaps, buckles, buttons, zippers, and eyelets with      shoelaces. It's a good idea to make a paper facsimile of      your booklet before cutting or stitching the fabric, so      you'll also need a pad of paper and a pencil.    </p>        <p>      To prepare the pages, cut ten 10"x20" rectangles from the      sturdy cloth, making sure to keep the pieces of uniform      size. Fold five of these in half (to 10"x 10"), each with      its right sides together, and iron them to sharpen the      creases. Then go on to fold the remaining five pieces in      half, each with its wrong sides together. Iron them as      well. Now, match the rectangles as shown in Fig. 1,      arranging them into five pairs, right sides exposed. While      you have the iron hot, turn under a 1/4" hem on all four      sides of each rectangle and press it flat, mitering the      corners (see Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      The center folds will become the spine of the booklet. Each      pair of rectangles will be decorated on the right sides of      the fabric, and then stitched together around the edges.      This will produce a total of four pages, front and back.      Finally, all five double-layered rectangles will be sewn      together on the center crease to make the finished booklet      of 10 leaves for a total of 20 decorated pages. (You can      see why a preliminary mock-up would be helpful.)    </p>    <h3>Design to be Played With</h3>        <p>      The first and best sources for quiet-book designs are      probably your own observations and imagination. For      instance, many children have a special interest in a      particular subject such as firefighting, boats, animals, or      cars. Fascinating scenes and figures can be developed using      any or all of these favorite themes. Whatever designs you      choose, however, each should involve at least one activity:      zipping open an appliqued suitcase that contains some      Velcro-backed stick-on toys, perhaps snapping wheels on and      off a truck. Other favorite activities include removing and      replacing Velcro-fastened sails on a fleet of boats, tying      shoelaces in real eyelets on a lightly stuffed,      fabric-scrap shoe, or rearranging stick-on animals in a      jungle scene. (A popular page in Keith's book features an      apple tree outlined with embroidery thread-green for      the leaves and brown for the trunk. Apples made from red      knit scraps with Velcro backings are stuck to matching      Velcro patches on the tree, and the words "Pick the      Apples!" are embroidered directly underneath the tree.)    </p>    <p>      Once you've chosen your designs, sketch them lightly on the      background fabric with a marking pencil if you're going to      embroider them. If you plan to use appliqued design, make      paper patterns from which to work. Be sure to position the      artwork-to-be on the right side of the background fabric,      then stitch it in place. The pictures can be embroidered or      appliqued, or both. Just keep in mind that the booklet and      its parts will receive a lot of handling, so all of the      components must be assembled securely. (A sewing      machine-especially one that makes zigzag      stitches-does a good job with appliqu√©, and      may be suitable for free-arm machine embroider, as well.)    </p>    <p>      When you've covered each half of each of the 10"x20"      rectangles, including those of the front and back covers,      you're ready to put the booklet together.    </p>    <h3>Pin, Stitch, and Go</h3>         <p>      The first assembly task will be to make a set of ties (or      some other type of closure), perhaps from leftover scraps      of fabric. Insert the ends of the ties between the cover      rectangle and its matching inside piece (see Fig. 1) and      pin them in place. Now pin the two rectangles together, and      stitch them all the way around, 1/8" from the outside edge,      catching the tie ends as you do so. Go over those joinings      twice with the machine. Match and stitch the other      rectangles in the same way, making sure that all the      designs are right side up before you sew.    </p>    <p>      When you're done, lay the resulting five double-sided      rectangles one on top of the other, lining up the center      crease. Check to be sure the front and back covers are on      the outside where they belong, and sew all five pieces      together with a seam down the center crease. (Again, go      over this seam two or three times for extra strength.)      Finally, check to see that all the removable parts of each      design are in place, close the booklet, and tie it up.    </p>    <p>      Keith's booklet stays safely tucked away until the time      rolls around for a meeting, a conference, or a church      service. Because the toy is reserved for special occasions,      Keith is always fascinated when he gets to play with it.      Furthermore, the little quiet book improves his ability to      manipulate zippers, shoelaces, buckles, and buttons while      encouraging creative silence at appropriate times!    </p>
