                <p>      <strong>Tossed delicacies</strong>    </p>            <h5 id="byline">      By Deborah A. Duchon    </h5>        <p>      AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, WEEDING IS one of our most important      gardening chores. Weeds, those unwelcome trespassers, can      grow rapidly, choking out our tender hybrid flowers and      vegetables. Although we spend so much of our time fighting      them, comparatively few of us actually know much about      weeds.    </p>    <p>      Have you ever wondered why some plants make weeds of      themselves? It's as if this wild vegetation prefers human      company to life in the pristine wilderness. Ironically,      it's because many of these plants were naturalized many      centuries ago by our ancestors for food, medicine, or other      purposes-they're actually semidomesticated. Although      we abandoned them as our lifestyles changed, they      faithfully continue to follow us!    </p>    <p>      Most of those dreadful weeds are edible. Some are choice,      and are cultivated in other countries and by those of us      who still appreciate them. I've been eating and enjoying      beneficial weeds for over 20 years in addition to more      "normal" foods, for their flavor, freshness, and      nutritional value. They're also free-another      inescapable attribute.    </p>    <p>      By using those weeds as food, you will realize a number of      benefits: One, You get an "early harvest" at a time when      most gardens are just getting started. Two, you increase      the productivity of your garden. (Weeds, you'll come to      see, are not pests-they're homegrown food.) Three, as      with most other homegrown food, you'll save money. This      particular food is especially economical-it's totally      free (you didn't even have to pay for the seeds). Four,      you'll expand your own culinary horizons. There are      approximately 50,000 edible plant species in the world, but      the average American eats only 30. Hence, if you only use      three kinds of weeds as part of your diet, you've probably      increased your food choices by 10%! And five, it's easier      to avoid using herbicides once you view weeds as food,      helping the environment.    </p>    <p>      Although wild plant life varies in different climate zones,      there are quite a number of weeds that are considered      "cosmopolitan"- they thrive nearly everywhere. Here      are just a few of the most pervasive garden, or "lawn"      weeds. If you are familiar with these plants, feel free to      experiment with them. But don't try eating anything you're      not sure of. Check its identity with a good field guide,      your local agricultural extension agent or park ranger. By      the way, many nature centers and state parks offer edible      plant walks. This is one of the best ways to learn more      about wild foods.    </p>    <h3>      Purslane, Portulaca oleracea    </h3>    <p>      Also known as "pulley." this common garden weed is rich in      flavor and nutrients. Purslane's a popular vegetable in      many parts of the world, including Holland and France. If      you've visited Mexico, you may have enjoyed it as      "verdolago." In fact, part of its scientific name,      oleracea, actually means "like a garden vegetable." No less      a personage than Henry David Thoreau praised purslane in      the classic, Walden, when he wrote "I have made a      satisfactory dinner off a dish of purslane, which I      gathered and boiled. Yet, men have come to such a pass that      they frequently starve, not for lack of necessaries but for      want of luxuries."    </p>    <p>      Purslane prefers sunny spots in sandy, rich soil. It      carpets the ground, rarely growing more than five inches      high. The succulent, purplish-green leaves range from 1/2      to two inches long. The tender red stems bear tiny,      five-petaled yellow flowers at their tips. The whole plant      is edible. Some purslane lovers have found that they can      use one plant from June till frost, just by snipping off      the tips of the stems. A fast grower, the plant soon      replaces them.    </p>    <p>      The most common way of eating purslane is as Thoreau      did-by boiling the stems and leaves (no need to      remove flowers or seeds). Some people like to mix the      cooked greens with bacon and vinegar. It has a tangy flavor      and a mucilaginous quality, similar to okra, and can be      used as a thickener in soups, like gumbo, or stew. If you      don't like the "slimy" texture, you can counteract it by      breading and frying, a delicious substitute.    </p>    <p>      Raw purslane has a pleasant crunch and is a good salad      green. An interesting "purslane cole slaw" can be made by      chopping up the raw leaves and stems, mixing with chopped      carrots or other raw vegetables and blending with      commercial coleslaw dressing.    </p>    <p>      Purslane's great taste, high level of nutrition and low      caloric content (the plant is 92% water, similar to      cabbage) make it a favorite. Euell Gibbons was particularly      fond of purslane and liked to experiment with it, as      reported in his famous book, Stalking the Wild Asparagus.      Among other things, he discovered that it pickled well. He      packed two pint jars with purslane stems and leaves, then      covered them with a mixture of one cup white vinegar, two      cups cold water, 1/4 cup salt and 1/2 teaspoon alum. Then      he added two dill flowers, a clove of garlic, and one small      red pepper. After sealing the jars, he let them sit in a      dark place for at least one month. "No cooking, no      processing, no fuss, no bother," states he. Other people      have found that any good dill or bread-and-butter pickle      recipe works equally well.    </p>    <p>      The seeds are edible as a grain. Gather, grind, and cook      them into mush, or mix 50-50 with regular flour for use in      breads, etc. Although tiny, they are numerous. One plant      can produce as many as 52,000 seeds. An easy way to collect      them is to harvest several plants. Then, just lay them down      on a piece of plastic. Over a period of a few days, the      seeds will ripen and the seed pods will burst open on their      own. Shake them out over the plastic and strain to remove      the seeds from the chaff. This was said to be a popular      food among the Indians of the Southwest at one time.    </p>    <p>      A 1/3 cup serving of cooked purslane yields 24 calories,      1.7 grams protein, 78 mg calcium, 39 grams phosphorous, 67      mg magnesium, 488 mg potassium, 3.5 mg iron, 2500 IU      Vitamin A and 25 grams Vitamin C. Additionally, purslane is      a good source of heart-protective Omega-3 fatty acids.    </p>    <h3>      Dandelion, Taraxacum officinale    </h3>        <p>      Like most Americans, dandelion is an immigrant, brought      here by the earliest English settlers. It was considered      absolutely essential for survival and was given an honored      place in the kitchen gardens of the day, providing food,      medicine, and wine. Because it is an effective diuretic, it      has been used for kidney stones, weight loss, and edema.      They also recognize a "bitter principle" in the plant that      aids digestion and stimulates the liver and gall bladder.      Its ability to cleanse the system of toxic matter makes it      valuable in clearing up chronic skin disorders.    </p>    <p>      Although these are mostly folk uses, modern researchers are      finding that, indeed, regular use of dandelion roots and      greens does stimulate the liver to produce more bile,      aiding in digestion, especially of fat (which could be part      of the reason that it helps with weight loss).    </p>    <p>      Related to daisies and chrysanthemums, dandelions are so      familiar to us that they really need no description.      Botanists describe them as "herbaceous perennials," meaning      that they grow back from the same root year after year, but      never get woody. A low-growing plant, the leaves grow in a      rosette (or circle), rarely exceeding 10 inches in length.      If constantly mowed, as most lawn weeds are, the leaves      flatten out and grow to only a few inches. Try      experimenting by not mowing your dandelions-you'll      see them grow into handsome plants! The upright flower      stalk bears a fluffy yellow flower, which soon      metamorphoses into the familiar blowball of seeds that      children love to wish upon.    </p>    <p>      Every part of the dandelion, with the exception of the      seeds and flower stalk, is useful. Eat the young leaves in      early spring, either raw or steamed. Try to find them      before the flower appears, or they will be quite bitter,      although still nutritious. To reduce the bitterness,      blanche the greens in boiling water, pour off the water,      and then complete boiling them in fresh water. They will      still have some bitterness, but persevere: Dandelion      greens, like oysters, are an acquired taste.    </p>    <p>      Dig up the roots anytime, although they will be highest in      nutrients in the fall. Boil them like parsnips. You can      also use them as a caffeine-free coffee substitute, while      enjoying dandelion's health benefits. Here's how to do it:      Cut the cleaned roots into small pieces and roast in a      400°F oven until dark brown. Cool, then grind in a      coffee grinder or blender on the "coarse" setting. Prepare      as you do your regular coffee. Some people prefer to mix      the roasted roots with standard coffee, to smooth its      flavor and reduce their caffeine intake. The flower buds,      sauteed in butter or margarine, make an interesting and      colorful side dish. Shred the flowers into salads for color      and flavor.    </p>    <p>      There are many, many recipes for dandelion wine. This one      is courtesy of North Georgia naturalist Marie Mellinger. It      makes a thick, sweet wine that's good for sipping on cold      winter nights.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dandelion Wine</strong><br />      <br />      1 gallon dandelion flowers with all the green parts      removed<br />      1 gallon boiling water<br />      4 lemons<br />      4 oranges<br />      4 pounds sugar<br />      1 cake yeast<br />      <br />      Pour boiling water over blossoms, let stand until the      flowers rise to the surface (24-48 hours). Strain      into a glass or stone jug or jar. Add lemons, oranges,      sugar, and yeast. Stir four or five times a day until it      stops fermenting. Keep well covered in a cool, place. In      two weeks, strain, bottle and cork tightly. Let sit at      least two months before drinking.    </p>    <p>      A 1/3 cup serving of the cooked greens contain 45 calories,      2.7 grams protein, 1.6 grams fiber, 187 mg calcium, 3.10 mg      iron (about the same as spinach), 36 mg magnesium, 88 mg      phosphorous, 297 mg potassium, 35 mg Vitamin C (the minimum      daily requirement) and 14,000 IU Vitamin A (similar to      carrots).    </p>    <h3>      Violets, Viola spp.    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Half a cup of violets has as much Vitamin C as four      oranges!</strong>    </p>        <p>      In Greek mythology, the philandering Zeus, king of the      gods, seduced a lovely river-nymph named lo. To shield her      from his jealous wife, he changed her into a white heifer.      Io wept over being reduced to eating coarse grass, so Zeus      created the sweet, delicate violet from lo's own tears, to      give her a more suitable feed. This story may not be too      politically correct these days, but some of the points      about violets still fit.    </p>    <p>      Violets are one of our best-loved wild-flowers. And, just      as they were good food for poor lo, they are still good      food for us. High in Vitamin A, Vitamin C (1/2 cup of the      raw flowers contains as much Vitamin C as four oranges!),      iron and calcium, violet can be enjoyed for more than their      dainty appearance.    </p>    <p>      Like dandelions, violets are so familiar that they need      little description. Small. herbaceous perennials, they      spread via an underground stem, or "rhizome." And despite      their size and seeming delicacy, they are tough survivors      and downright aggressive in the right conditions. When they      take over a flower bed, even the most laid-back gardeners      start seeing them less as wild flowers than weeds. If you      start eating them, you'll be able to control their growth      and still enjoy them.    </p>    <p>      There are more than 20 species of violets growing in North      America, with flowers ranging from white to yellow to blue      and purple. All are edible, but most people prefer the      flavor of the darker colored flowertypes.    </p>    <p>      Candied violets are a traditional confection in Britain.      They're easy to make and sensational gifts.    </p>    <h3>      Candied Violets    </h3>    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        <strong>RULES FOR WILD EDIBLES</strong><br />        <br />        Don't eat anything you cannot positively identify. There        are not really too many plants that can kill you, but        some can make you quite ill.<br />        Don't pick anything growing within 100 feet of a busy        street. Plants can absorb the lead spewed out by passing        traffic.<br />        Don't pick in public lands, such as parks, where it is        illegal. Unless you are harvesting your own weeds, don't        kill off an entire population. Take only what you need        and leave enough to regenerate.<br />      </p>    </div>    <p>      Collect a bunch of fresh flowers, wash and dry carefully.    </p>    <p>      Separate one egg. Whip the white until just foamy. Save the      yolk for another purpose.    </p>    <p>      Dip the flowers, one at a time, into the egg white. Be sure      to cover all surfaces. Then dip the flowers, one at a time,      into a dish of super-fine white sugar. (If super-fine is      not available, run regular white sugar through the blender      for a few minutes.) It is important to cover all surfaces.    </p>    <p>      How you finish this is up to you. You may simply roll the      flower into a little ball, or, to be really fancy, use a      toothpicks to spread each flower back to its original      shape. Sprinkle with a little more super-tine sugar.    </p>    <p>      Set the flowers on waxed paper to dry. Once dry, they will      keep for several months if stored in tins or other airtight      containers.    </p>    <p>      Use to garnish cakes or pastries.    </p>    <p>      Violet leaves are good to eat raw or cooked. Like purslane,      they have a mild mucilaginous quality and can be added to      cooked dishes as a thickener. I like to add them to salads,      mixing in their dark green leaves with the lighter leaves      of domestic greens. The flowers also make a colorful      addition to salads. Mix cooked violet greens with other      cooked vegetables, such as spinach, for flavor and      nutrition.    </p>    <p>      As violet leaves get older, they get tough and bitter.      Although still edible, they are not as pleasant to eat raw      as when they were young and tender. I have had good success      making a tempura with the older leaves. Simply mix a few      tablespoons of flour with cold water to make a thin paste.      Add a pinch of salt or baking soda. Coat the washed, dried      leaves with the batter and drop into a pan of very hot      vegetable oil. The tempura cooks rapidly and absorbs little      oil. These make a crunchy treat or appetizer.    </p>    <p>      Medicinally, violet leaves are an effective laxative. Due      to their mucilaginous qualities and high fiber content,      regular use will keep you regular, too. For that reason,      most people don't eat too many leaves at one sitting. The      leaves should be prepared for use mixed with other greens,      as in salads or cooked vegetables, rather than eaten as a      "stand-alone" dish, unless for medicinal use.    </p>    <h3>      Chickweed, Stellaria media    </h3>        <p>      Chickweed is quite possibly the most common weed in the      world. It has been found growing north of the Arctic      Circle, at the tip of South America, and everywhere in      between. It is also a highly valued plant in places other      than the United States, and is still cultivated in many      countries, especially in Asia.    </p>    <p>      It, too, is a small plant, rarely reaching more than five      inches in height. Weak-stemmed, it seems to spread out      horizontally along the ground. It prefers rich soil, a      little shelter, and cool weather. Hence, it often is the      first thing to appear in the garden, sometimes as early as      February. Here in Georgia, it is abundant throughout fall,      winter, and early spring, withering away when the weather      gets hot. In more temperate climates, it can be found all      summer, often in the shade of a fence or larger plant.    </p>    <p>      The whole plant, above ground, is edible raw or cooked.      Raw, it has little flavor. For this reason, it is one of my      favorite plants, because with its mild flavor and crunchy      texture, I can use it just like lettuce, as the base for      salads. It mixes well with any other more strongly-flavored      salad fixin's such as watercress, radishes, and peppers.      With a classic vinaigrette dressing, chickweed is my      favorite salad during the time of year that lettuce is most      expensive.    </p>    <p>      Cook chickweed just like spinach: boiled or steamed, it      even tastes like an extremely mild spinach. As it cooks      down quite a bit, use a lot. Because its flavor does not      overpower other vegetables, it's a good thing to add to the      "greens pot" to stretch other greens. For instance, you      could mix chickweed, dandelions and violets as your      vegetable course for supper.    </p>    <p>      Chickweed packs a nutritional punch, too. It contains so      much Vitamin C that at one time it was used to treat      scurvy. It's also a good source of the B vitamins and      several minerals, most notably, copper, and iron.    </p>    <h3>      Wild Onion/garlic, Allium spp    </h3>        <p>      When you mow your lawn, does the scent of onion or garlic      fill the air? Lucky you! There are a great many species of      these two closely-related herbs, but any plant that smells      strongly of onion or garlic is onion or garlic and is      edible.    </p>    <p>      Dig the bulb up to see which one you have. Just like their      domesticated relatives, onions will be layered and garlic      will be made up of cloves. Don't be fooled by their small      size-their flavor is often stronger than domesticated      varieties. Use the green tops like chives or green onion      tops. In the summer, the underground bulb withers away. No      problem-you'll find the bulblets at the top of the      plant are good eating, too. Even the flowers have the      distinctive onion/garlic flavor, and make an interesting      addition to early summer salads.    </p>    <p>      An easy way to familiarize yourself with using this wild      herb is to make wild onion or garlic toast. Simply melt a      few tablespoons of butter and mix in about a teaspoon or so      of chopped wild onion or garlic (bulb or green tops). With      a pastry brush, spread the butter mixture onto sliced      bread. Place under broiler until brown.    </p>    <p>      Onions and garlic are favorite medicinal plants, as well.      They are antiseptic and help lower blood pressure.    </p>    <h3>      Wood Sorrel, Oxalis spp.    </h3>        <p>      Wood sorrel, also known as "sourgrass", is one of those      little weeds that children love to nibble on.      Unfortunately, once we grow up, we forget about it. What a      shame. This tasty and abundant herb is a valuable addition      to the kitchen garden.    </p>    <p>      Containing oxalic acid, wood sorrel has a lemony tang that      blends well with other foods. On camping trips, I have      stuffed fresh-caught fish with wood sorrel and grilled them      over the campfire for a real treat. There's no need to      carry lemons in your backpack with wood sorrel available!    </p>    <p>      Another small plant, wood sorrel generally grows only about      six to eight inches high. The pale green leaves are      composed of three leaflets, similar to clover. In fact,      many beginning foragers confuse wood sorrel with clover.      (Don't worry if you do, because clover, too, is edible. But      it is rather tough and lacks the lemony flavor of wood      sorrel.) It is not difficult to tell the difference. Clover      leaves are dark green and the leaflets are round, with      saw-tooth edges. There is often the mark of a white circle      on the leaflets, too. Wood sorrel leaves are pale green and      the leaflets, by contrast, are heartshaped with smooth      edges. The flowers are quite different. Clovers have white      or red, complex flowers. Sorrel flowers, by contrast, are      quite simple, five-petaled and trumpet shaped. They may be      white, pink, violet, or yellow. Those growing in backyards      and gardens are generally yellow.    </p>    <p>      The whole plant, aboveground, is edible, although you      probably will want to discard the tough stems. The raw      leaves, flowers and seed pods make a refreshing addition to      any salad. The crunchy seed pods, in particular, are a      treat.    </p>    <p>      You may also want to add wood sorrel to your pot of mixed      greens. It, too, can be boiled or steamed like spinach,      although cooking reduces its volume considerably. A little      wood sorrel added to sauces and soups can make a big      difference. In fact, the delicious kosher soup known as      "Schav" is based on domestic sorrel, which has the same      flavor.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Schav</strong><br />      <br />      Add 1/2 to 1 cup of the herb to one quart of boiling      water<br />      Add one small, chopped onion (wild onion works well!)<br />      Cook just until tender, 5-10 minutes.<br />      Remove from heat and add 1/2 teaspoon sour salt, if      desired.<br />      Mix well and refrigerate.    </p>    <p>      This soup is eaten cold and, with salad and crackers, makes      a refreshing summer meal. You may want to add a dollop of      sour cream to each serving.    </p>    <p>      I hope you will want to try eating some of the weeds in      your own backyard. They'll add freshness, flavor, and      variety to your diet, as well as increasing the      productivity of your garden. None of the plants mentioned      in this article are endangered in any way. But if you get      very interested in foraging, be sure to avoid harming      endangered plants. I'd like to hear about your adventures.
