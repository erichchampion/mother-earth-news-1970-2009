            		    <p>      <em><strong>In the Northern Hemisphere, there are over      2,000 varieties of the main types of plums!</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Where jams and jellies are concerned, wild plums are a      peach of a fruit, the apple of any picker's eye. A fickle      fruit that ripens any time between late spring and later      summer, it comes in a peck of colors, a barrel of shapes, a      bushel of sizes. Some are sweet, some tart. And it boasts      the highest food value of any fruit, with a 20%      carbohydrate content.    </p>    <p>      In the Northern Hemisphere, there are 2,000 varieties of      the main types. There are about 30 varieties of native wild      plums throughout the United States alone. Additional      hybrids add to the complexity of variation and dilution of      "purity." Some wild plums are the size of cherries, some      the size of eggs. Wild native types are diverse in skin      color: deep red, glowing orange, bluish crimson, bright      red, bright yellow, dark yellow. Shapes may be globate,      oval, conical, or heartlike. All are smooth skinned,      hard-pitted drupes with yellow juicy "meat."    </p>    <p>      The first wild plums ( <em>Prunus americana</em> and other      species) are usually ready to be plucked by June. While      picking plums, one should exercise a fair amount of      caution: the twigs of these scrubby trees are covered with      dull, pointed thorns. The fruit itself grows singly, not in      clusters as do cherries. Ripe plums will drop into one's      hand at a finger's slightest provocation, and yield an      elastic sensation to the squeeze of pinching fingers.    </p>    <p>      Ripened fruits which have been warmed by the sun (and      untouched by the ravages of decay), can often be retrieved      from the ground. Wild plums which do not separate easily      from the twigs are not fully ripened, but should be      included in a harvest to add a tang of taste, and more      importantly-natural pectin (the substance that makes      jelly jell).    </p>    <h3>      Easy Plum Jelly    </h3>        <p>      Six pounds of plums should make four or five pints of      crimson jelly or jam. After they are washed, the wild plums      should be placed in a pan with two cups of water, covered      with a lid, and put on a stove on "high" until they boil.      They should then be left to simmer until the fruit becomes      mushy. This mush should be stirred occa sionally while the      fruit is softening up. This process shouldn't take much      longer than 30 minutes.    </p>    <p>      Once "mushified," the plum residue should be left to cool      for a few moments. Then pour it into a jelly bag which has      been draped over a colander and inserted into another pot.    </p>    <p>      The plum mush should be left to drip through the jelly bag,      until all of the juice has been collected in the second      pot. This may take several hours; letting it drain      overnight may be practical. The plums should not be      squeezed to get the juice out, else the jelly will become      clouded. Also, it would be best to either "mushify" all      red, or red with yellow plums. A jam or jelly containing      all yellow plums might taste too bland.    </p>    <p>      Note: Plums may be kept refrigerated for a few days if      there is a necessary delay in preserving them. This may      occur when there has been a limited daily harvest, as a      result of a slow ripening crop.    </p>    <p>      To ensure jelling, one box of prepared pectin (1 3/4 dry      ounces) should be used for every six cups of cooked plum      juice. To begin converting the juice to jelly, the juice      should first be brought to a boil, then the pectin added.    </p>    <p>      Next, add 7 1/2 cups of sugar, and stir the mixture to      avoid scorching.    </p>    <p>      Bring the mixture to a boil again, and keep it boiling for      a minute or two before removing the pan from the heat. Foam      should be skimmed off the top-before the hot cooked      mixture is poured into jars to jell.    </p>    <p>      Some people like to scald their jars with hot wa ter before      putting their juice into them; while others prefer heating      the jars in an oven at 200°F. for about 15 minutes.      Sealing can be accomplished with melted paraffin or domed      lids, according to package directions.    </p>    <p>      Finally, store and enjoy!    </p>
