                    <h5 id="byline">      by Lane L. Winward    </h5>    <p>      THERE IS MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING about the use of the word      organic. When it comes to using the word in relation to      lawn care, misunderstanding becomes outright confusion.      Many people depend heavily on the use of chemical      pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers to keep lawns      healthy. These chemicals, however, can cause damage to      plants that are not being sprayed but are in the vicinity,      can cause harm to passing or resident animals, and in      extreme cases can cause soil and water pollution if they      are overused or used improperly.    </p>    <p>      It has been said that where these chemicals are used by      many residents, they can enter into the food or water      supply and become a direct danger to people's health. For      these reasons, it's important that we keep our lawncare      methods as natural and organic as possible.    </p>    <h3>Fertilizers</h3>    <p>      In the case of fertilizing, there are many products and      procedures that can be considered organic and natural:    </p>    <p>      1. Simply cut your lawn without a bag and leave the      clippings to feed the lawn. Or better yet, use an      up-to-date mulching mower to grind the grass up to usable      proportions for your lawns.    </p>    <p>      2. Use ground manure in light and regular amounts, since      just leaving the clippings does not provide enough of the      major and micro nutrients to keep a lawn at peak condition.    </p>    <p>      3. If manure is not available, then use minimally processed      sewage, another natural form of fertilizer (in most cases      there is no other use for the substance and there is a lot      of it produced naturally on a regular basis!).    </p>    <p>      Most synthetic fertilizers are made up of the exact same      elements as natural fertilizers, such as manure. The only      difference is that synthetic fertilizers are more      concentrated. This means that you must use far more of a      natural fertilizer to get the same results you achieve with      the synthetic.    </p>    <p>      Do not let the word synthetic fool you. Many individuals      define the word as something that is unnatural and      therefore undesirable. In the case of fertilizer, this is      not quite true. Synthetic just means concentrated and not      produced by an organism. While potassium is extracted from      plant matter naturally by the digestion of an animal, it is      synthetically extracted from plant matter by a more      efficient but mechanical means. However, the use you put it      to is organically still the same.    </p>    <h3>Pesticides</h3>   <p>      Unfortunately, the most effective pesticides are inorganic.      If an organic method is desired there are not many options.    </p>    <p>      1. In cases where a certain pest is known to exist, choose      and plant a cultivated variety of grass that might be      resistant to or unaffected by the particular pest. This is      a limited option.    </p>    <p>      2. In recent years, certain diseases, such as milky spore      disease, are being studied, developed, and used that are      entirely passive to a lawn but will in time totally      decimate a particular pest. The above-mentioned disease,      for example, attacks Japanese beetles, but can take five      years to spread far enough to be effective. It could be      many years before this means of ridding an average lawn of      a troublesome pest is developed well enough to be of more      than limited use.    </p>    <p>      3. A last method is to introduce a pest into a lawn that is      passive to grass but will devour any lawn pests. Because      there are always unforeseen ramifications when an outside      predator is brought in to a new and unprepared ecological      cycle, this method has not yet seen active commercial or      home-lawn use.    </p>    <p>      At this point in time, all biological methods of pest      control seem to have the same negative traits. They only      attack one type of pest and they take up to several years      to work. This is more than likely to change at some point.      The best way to stay apprised of any possible changes is to      maintain good contact with a local nursery person.    </p>    <h3>Herbicides</h3>    <p>      All chemical herbicides are considered inorganic in nature.      Some kill only weed seeds and others will attack only weed      roots. Some chemicals only kill a weed's leafy structures,      leaving the main stem to die without nourishment. But the      cumulative effects on the water table and food supply are      still the same. The organic methods of weed control are      simple to recognize but difficult to put into practice    </p>    <p>      1. Pull weeds out by hand. This takes time and      effort-and only two-thirds of the pulled weeds are      permanently removed. The reason is that it is just about      impossible to remove the entire root of a weed from the      intertwined root system of a growing lawn. A good example      of this problem is the dandelion. This weed sends down a      root sometimes as deep as two feet. And if upon removal      only two inches is left, the weed will return.    </p>    <p>      2. Keep a lawn thatched and well aerated for good drainage.      Institute a good fertilizing and watering program. A      healthy lawn is the best deterrent for weeds. When a lawn      is thick and green, weeds cannot find a place to take root.      When thatch has been kept to a minimum, weed seeds and      fungus will find no place to shelter and grow.    </p>    <p>      3. Plant cultivated varieties of grass that are resistant      to weeds prominent in your location.    </p>    <p>      4. Maintain a good mowing schedule to keep many weeds from      flourishing. When stems and leaves are chopped on a regular      basis, some weeds will die from sustained damage. Others      are kept cut down to an almost unnoticeable low profile.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the organic battle against weeds is an      endless and ever-occurring thing. Weed seeds permeate soils      by the millions and they are continuously reshuffled and      moved around by animals, people, and machines. But remember      that even with the use of an effective herbicide, this      battle will go on.    </p>    <h3>Lawn Mowing</h3>         <p>      Most methods of organically mowing a lawn are not very      feasible or efficient. One is using a grass-eating      herbivore to devour the blades as they grow. Sheep will do      the job, and so will horses! But they are not too      meticulous about keeping the grass even, and in most urban      areas there are zoning laws that would keep them out even      if they did an impeccable job.    </p>    <p>      Why would someone want a method for organic lawn mowing?      Because with the number of lawns created around the world      and the amount of pollution contributed by the mowing      machines cutting these lawns, many people are searching for      a better way. Here are two plausible, reasonably      ecologically sound lawn-mowing methods:    </p>    <p>      1. Instead of using a gas-powered mower, use an electric      mower. They are quiet, they do not pollute directly and      they are very efficient in terms of starting, running, and      wear ratios. The only drawback is the necessity of      obtaining and using an extension power cord that is long      enough to reach every corner of the area to be mowed.    </p>    <p>      2. Do not let your lawn grow fast. It is not possible to      maintain a thick and beautifully green lawn this way, but      if only a bare minimum of fertilizer is used and if the      watering cycle is cut back just enough to keep the lawn a      greenish-yellow and not brown, then a lawn will grow very      slowly. With this method, a lawn that normally must be cut      each week will only need it once every three weeks. But      don't allow the lawn to dry out enough to turn brown.    </p>    <p>      As people grow more concerned about the environment and      laws are passed to protect the planet from harmful      substances, new methods for old procedures are developed.      In one large city in California, a bill has been proposed      that would require all residents in the city limits to use      electric mowers. This was an attempt to do something to cut      back on the air pollution, but regardless of the reason, it      made considerably more difficult the "business as usual"      approach to lawn care.    </p>    <p>      In some other states where drought has continued for three      years or more, fines of up to $1,000 have been issued to      citizens who continued the regular practice of watering      their lawns in spite of emergency orders to the contrary.      In many of these areas, new methods of landscaping that do      not require such constant watering and maintenance are      being developed and used. These designs are called      xeriscapes.    </p>    <p>      The idea behind a xeriscape is to have a landscape that      requires little or no watering and little or now weeding.      This would, of course, preclude all use of weed killers,      pesticides, and fertilizers. But they are little comfort      those of us who still love a lawn and they do not help with      watersheds or oxygen production.    </p>    <p>      But whether this pointed disfavor grows or not, the only      method of turning the environmental eye away from current      methods of quality lawn care is to develop truly efficient      and usable natural means of maintaining lawns. The beauty      that is presented by deep green carpets of grass is too      great to risk its being lost because such methods are not      ecologically responsible.    </p>    <p>      Editor's Note: Lane L.
