                    <p>      A Midsummer Night's Dream: The Easiest Homemade Ice Cream      and Cones Yet-With No Costly Machines or Endless      Cranking!    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Gail Damerow    </h5>        <p>      Ice cream parlors are enjoying renewed popularity. Sales      are breaking new records. Community service organizations      have become partial to old-fashioned ice cream socials.      There's no doubt about it, ice cream is the Great American      Dessert-more popular than all other desserts      combined.    </p>    <p>      Many of us have come to regard ice cream as a household      staple. Citing the 98 percent who enjoy it on a regular      basis, zealots go so far as to name ice cream our nation's      number-one resource. On average, each of us spoons down      nearly 23 quarts per year, making Americans the world's      highest per capita consumers and qualifying the United      States as the undisputed Ice Cream Capital of the World.    </p>    <h3>      The Secrets of "Still" Freezing    </h3>    <p>      While everyone enjoys ice cream, many people don't know how      simple-and inexpensive-making it can be. The      truth is, you really don't need those costly gadgets to      make wonderful homemade ice cream. You can make it right in      your own freezer. The process is called "still freezing,"      because (as the name implies), it just kind of sits still      in your freezer. This is different than an ice cream maker,      which continously stirs your concoction and keeps ice      crystals from forming. While your best still-frozen dessert      will never be as smooth as one that is "stir frozen,"      making ice cream in your freezer provides a fun adventure.    </p>    <p>      And there are little tricks to help you smooth out your ice      cream texture. For starts, corn syrup, cornstarch, gelatin,      and eggs all interfere with ice crystal formation and      encourage the incorporation of air. When cream or egg      whites are used, they're often whipped before being folded      in. Otherwise, the finished mix is whipped after it's      frozen firm enough to hold tiny bubbles of air.    </p>    <p>      Also rapid, even freezing keeps ice crystals small.      Encourage fast freezing by using shallow containers, such      as ice trays with the slats removed, loaf pans, cake tins,      or anything else that holds a layer no more than two inches      deep. Cover your filled trays with foil to keep additional      ice crystals from forming on the surface as the mix      freezes. And plan to serve your stillfrozen creations      within a day or so.    </p>    <p>      You can speed the freezing along by placing trays either at      the bottom of the freezer compartment, or on a shelf with      coils. If possible, rest them on already frozen foods      rather than directly on the shelf. Make sure you place your      freezer down to its coldest setting, usually around    </p>    <p>      0°F (-18°C). Most chest and upright freezers      normally operate at that low a temperature. If you use the      freezer compartment of your refrigerator, then adjust the      setting an hour in advance, and return it to normal after      the mixture has frozen.    </p>    <h3>      On Ice    </h3>        <p>      The beauty of still freezing is that it even lets you make      ice cream without electricity. You can, for example, freeze      ice cream on picnics and outings to surprise your family      and friends. You'll need a picnic chest or other large,      insulated container loaded with cracked ice. Or in winter,      you can use lake ice or hard-packed snow.    </p>    <p>      Pour your mix into a freezer-safe tray with a snap-on lid      that won't let brine seep in. Ideal containers include      Tupperware or Rubbermaid ones de signed for storing      cupcakes or pies. With the lid securely in place, bed the      filled container in cracked ice combined three-to-one with      rock salt.    </p>    <p>      Pack at least three inches of ice around the sides, top,      and bottom of the container. In really hot weather, you may      need to drain off brine and add more ice and salt before      freezing is complete, usually in ''four to six hours.    </p>    <h3>      Vanilla Ice Cream    </h3>    <p>      Gelatin gives this ice cream extra body, letting you get by      with less stirring. If you're among those who feel that the      flavor of gelatin overpowers delicate vanilla, omit the      gelatin and substitute light cream for the milk.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon plain gelatin<br />      1/2 cup milk</em> <em><br />      1/2 cup sugar</em> <em><br />      1/2 cup heavy</em> <em>cream</em> <em><br />      2 teaspoons vanilla</em>    </p>    <p>      In a saucepan, soften gelatin in milk. Heat until gelatin      dissolves, and stir in the sugar. Let the mixture cool.      Then pour it into the freezer, and chill until slushy. Whip      heavy cream into soft peaks, and then add vanilla. Beat      frozen mixture, fold in whipped cream, and pour into a      freezer tray or mold. Freeze firm. Yield: about 1 quart.    </p>    <h3>      Creamy Caramel Ice Cream    </h3>    <p>      This recipe takes advantage of two characteristics of      evaporated milk-its slightly caramelized flavor and      its ability to whip up light and fluffy. For a delightful      coffee undertone, dissolve 1 t instant coffee in the 1/4 C      evaporated milk. To make <em>Caramel nut</em> ice cream,      fold in 1/2 C finely chopped pecans with the whipped milk.    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 tablespoon butter<br />      1/3 cup brown sugar<br /></em> <em>2 tablespoons      water<br /></em> <em>1 cup evaporated milk</em> <em><br />      1 teaspoon vanilla</em>    </p>    <p>      In a small saucepan, melt butter. Add brown sugar and      water, and stir until sugar dissolves. Bring mixture to a      boil, and then boil for 3 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup      evaporated milk. Cool and add 1 teaspoon vanilla. Chill      well, and then whip 3/4 cup evaporated milk. Fold in sugar      mixture. Freeze firm, 3 to 4 hours. Yield: about 1 quart.    </p>    <h3>      Cherry Ice Cream    </h3>    <p>      Fresh cherries add crunchy bits of tasty fruit to this      confection. Canned cherries are already pitted, but they're      neither as crunchy nor as easy to chop. Whether you use      fresh or carped, select sour cherries such as Queen Anne,      which are more flavorful than sweet ones like Bing. This      recipe will also make peach or apricot ice cream with the      simple substitution of the appropriate fruit.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups sour cherries<br /></em> <em>1 cup sugar</em>      <em><br />      2 cups heavy cream</em>    </p>    <p>      Pit and chop cherries, and then add sugar. Let stand for 20      minutes. Stir in 1 cup of heavy cream. Pour into freezer      tray, and freeze slushy. Turn into large bowl and beat      until smooth. Whip into soft peaks and add the rest of      heavy cream. Freeze firm, 3 to 4 hours. Yield: about 1      quart.    </p>    <h3>      Breakfast Ice Cream    </h3>    <p>      Fussy little eaters don't take much coaxing to chow down on      a breakfast of fortified cereal topped with egg-rich French      vanilla, garnished with fresh strawberries or sliced      bananas. Or serve up a scoop of this specially formulated      breakfast ice cream with the raisins, honey eggs, and high      protein cereal already incorporated.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 egg yolk<br />      1/4 cup sugar<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      1/2 tablespoon flour<br /></em> <em>1 cup milk<br /></em>      <em>1 teaspoon</em> <em>vanilla</em><br />      <em>2 C half and half</em><br />      <em>1/2 C chopped raisins</em><br />      <em>3/4 cup high protein cereal</em>    </p>    <p>      Lightly beat egg yolk, and add sugar, honey, and flour.      Next, heat milk in double, boiler. Pour a little milk over      yolk mixture stir mixture into remaining milk. Stir a heat      until mixture coats a metal spoon Strain and chill. Add      vanilla and half-ai: half. Then pour into freezer tray.      Free slushy. In a large bowl, beat until smooth. Stir in      raisins and cereal; freeze firm, 3 to 4 hours. Yield: about      1 quart.    </p>    <h3>      Roll Your Own    </h3>    <p>      The most popular way of eating ice cream is straight out of      a cone. We eat billions per year, making them a veritable      American in stitution. They are as practical as they are      crisp and tasty, and if you don't have a waffle-cone iron,      you can still make them on a cookie sheet or between the      flat sides of a reversible teflon waffle iron if it closes      tightly.    </p>    <p>      Your first few cones may look a bit crude, but don't      despair-after two or three, you'll learn to work      swiftly and smoothly, achiev ing near perfect cones times      after time. For slower cooling cookies, gently stuff bits      of crumpled waxed paper into the openings to keep them from      collapsing until they firm up.    </p>    <p>      Your cones will be more uniform if you shape them over a      cone form or metal cream horn, available at gourmet      cookware shops. Three is a good number of horns to have,      since that's how many cone cookie you can bake on the      average-sized sheet. <em>As</em> soon as the cones cool      enough to hold their shape, remove the horn for reuse on      the next batch. Cones keep well for two or three days at      room temperature or for several weeks in an airtight      container in the freezer.    </p>    <h3>      Crisp Cones    </h3>    <p>      Vary the flavor of these delicate cone by adding a pinch of      cinnamon or nutmeg, or by substituting almond, orange,      lemon, or any other extract for the vanilla.    </p>    <p>      <em>3/4 stick butter<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />      1/8 teaspoon vanilla<br />      1/2 tablespoon water<br />      3 egg whites<br />      1/2 cup flour</em>    </p>    <p>      Beat butter at high speed until fluffy, and gradually add      sugar. Beat again until fluffy, usually about 4 minutes.      Add vanilla and water. Beat in egg whites, one at a time.      Add flour and mix until smooth.    </p>    <p>      Let batter set for 2 hours at room tempera ture. Grease      baking sheets, and outline three 6" circles on each sheet.      Place 1 1/2 tablespoons batter in center of each. With the      back of a spoon, spread batter to fell circle. Bake at      425°F (220° C) until lightly browned. Using wide      pancake turner, remove from sheet and roll on at a time. If      cook ies cool and become too stiff to work, return to oven      a few seconds to soften. Yield: 8 cones.    </p>    <h3>      Sugar Cones    </h3>    <p>      These slightly chewy cones develop an in teresting textural      pattern during baking. Use walnuts, pecans, or toasted      almonds, or leave out the nuts for plain cones, but you'll      get fewer of them.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 egg<br />      3/4 teaspoon vanilla<br /></em> <em>3 tablespoons      water</em><br />      3/4 <em>cup light brown sugar<br /></em> <em>1 1/2      tablespoons melted butter<br />      1/2 cup flour<br />      3/4 cup finely chopped nuts</em>    </p>    <p>      Combine egg, vanilla, water, brown sugar, and butter. Beat      until sugar dissolves. Add flour and beat until smooth.      Stir in nuts.    </p>    <p>      Grease baking sheets well and sprinkle with flour. Outline      three 6" diameter circles on each sheet. Place 2 1/2      tablespoons batter in the center of each, spread evenly      with a spatula or bottom of a measuring cup, taking care to      leave no holes. Bake at 300°F (150°C) for 15      minutes until firm. Remove from oven and loosen, then bake      3 minutes more, until lightly brown. Remove from oven, cool      slightly, and roll one at a time. If cookies get too stiff      to work, return sheet to oven and heat for 1 minute. Yield:      8 cones.    </p>    <h3>      Whole Wheat Honey Cones    </h3>    <p>      These cones take a bit longer to firm up than most, giving      you more time to get the shape right. For less sweet cones,      use wheat germ in place of coconut. To make malted cones,      substitute barley malt syrup for all or part of the honey.    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 cup honey<br /></em> <em>2 tablespoons butter<br />      1/8 teaspoon salt<br /></em> <em>1 egg</em> <em><br />      1/2 cup whole wheat flour<br />      3/4 cup coconut</em>    </p>    <p>      In a small saucepan, over low heat , combine honey, butter,      and salt. Stir until butter dissolves, and then remove from      heat. Beat in egg and flour. Stir in coconut. Grease baking      sheets well and sprinkle with flour. Outline three 6"      diameter cir cles on each sheet. Place 24 tablespoons      batter in the center of each, spread evenly with the back      of a fork. Bake at 325°F (165°C) for 15 minutes,      until the edges are brown. Remove from oven, cool slightly,      and roll one at a time. If cookies get too stiff to work,      return sheet to oven for 1 minute. Yield: 8 cones.    </p>    <h3>      Be Adventurous    </h3>    <p>      The more ice cream you make, the more you'll look for that      one perfect recipe. But clearly, each of us has a different      idea of what constitutes perfection. One of the nicest      things about making your own ice cream is that you can      alter its characteristics to suit yourself.    </p>    <p>      When it comes to frozen treats, anything goes. So be bold.      Consider this a guideline for devising recipes that are      distinctly yours. Tasting, evaluating, adjusting, and      tasting again-it's all part of the exciting adventure      of making your own ice cream!    </p>    <p>      <em>Gail Damerow is the author of</em> Ice Cream!
