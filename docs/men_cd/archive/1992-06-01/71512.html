                    <h5 id="byline">      <strong>Young Wildlife by Patricia Penton Lembach</strong>    </h5>		    <p>      Our younger boys are now nine and 11 going on 16 and 18.      Our house seems joyously overrun with "neither/nors"      treading a happy path between childhood and adolescence,      demanding as is convenient the rights of both, accepting      graciously the responsibilities of neither. I observe that      this age group, roughly nine through 12, composes a more or      less specific classification of the genus Boy, and elicits      a number of rather well-defined characteristics. For want      of a better term, I shall call this classification      Middle-Size.    </p>    <p>      Members of this group, for example, feel entitled to wear      their hair down to their eyeballs, but feel no obligation      to comb it. They insist on "cool" clothes, which they will      fish from under the bed for the third or fourth day's      wearing. Middle-Size boys operate on the basis of one      inflexible rule: Get everything out, put nothing away.    </p>    <p>      Middle-Size friends call on the phone and in a determinable      number of minutes (the time required to pedal from there to      here) will enter the house, make their way to the small      bedroom upstairs, and caucus. Then they spill over to all      parts of the house in pursuit of varied activity. If they      launch into a peaceful game of Monopoly, it subsequently      erupts into a noisy hassle between the brothers, splitting      the group into factions bent on out-insulting one another.      Ultimately they will straggle to the kitchen, where they      display a characteristic common to all species of this      genus: insatiable appetite.    </p>    <p>      Whereas small boys can be satisfied between meals with a      few cookies and a glass of milk, Middle-Sizes have      appetites leaning more towards large pots of macaroni or      spaghetti, one pan per boy. When they become aware that      their friends are sitting around salivating, they      inevitably repeat the cooking process for each friend,      leaving the kitchen a wasteland of starch and strainers and      gummy pots. Dare to suggest that they probably won't want      much supper and you are treated to a harangue on how bad      the cafeteria lunch was today. "All we had to eat was      chocolate pudding!"    </p>    <p>      Bellies full, activity exhausted, they adjourn to a      neighboring house, where I presume they overrun the      premises in like fashion.    </p>    <p>      Middle-Size is an age of persecution; always in need of      interpretation is a statement such as, "My bus driver hates      me." It can mean she is a nasty and vindictive woman who is      persecuting your son. (An explanation too readily accepted      by parents who feel persecuted themselves.) It could mean      that she had a bad day and looked at him cross-eyed. It      probably means that after warning him eight days arunning,      she made him sit in the front seat for sticking his arm out      the window.    </p>    <p>      Love is best expressed during this period in harsh phrases      like, "Boy! I can hardly stand Mary Sue Thompson!" But a      boy's friend will freely give you the straight scoop while      he beats them to silence and tries to conceal a smile.      Having a bevy of boy's friends around always helps in      cutting through the half-truths. More truth emerges around      a noisy supper table where Middle Size boys are vying to      top one an other's facts than are ever told in grouptherapy      sessions.    </p>    <p>      Middle-Size friendships run hot and cold. This week's      friend is next week's arch enemy. Middle-Size boys never      have homework until 9:30 at night, and getting them to bed      is like trying to settle a war in the General Assembly of      the United Nations.    </p>    <p>      Middle-Size boys want you to share their prayers, but they      don't want the facts known at large. They have abandoned      Santa and the Easter Bunny, but are devoted to perpetuating      the myths for younger children. Middle Size children scorn      the responsibility of younger siblings in the presence of      their parents, but boisterously assume authority when their      parents are out of sight.    </p>    <p>      What boys want most at Middle-Size is spending money and      minibikes. What they need most is understanding,      responsibility, and plenty of attention. And you may be      sure that if their needs aren't met at home, they will go      to obnoxious lengths to win attention elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      <em>Reprinted From:</em> A Thread of Blue Denim <em>by      Patricia Penton Leimbach.
