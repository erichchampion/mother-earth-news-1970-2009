                <p><strong>      HANDS ON</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Pat Stone    </h5>        <p>      <em>A wilted broccoli stalk, a grapefruit peel, a carrot      top. That's energy</em> - <em>solidified      sunlight</em> - <em>you're throwing out with the      rest</em> of the trash and entombing in another too full      landfill. Energy that could be turned into compost for      houseplants, ornamentals or the home garden. By placing      composted vegetable scraps from your garden back into your      garden, you have created the smallest and simplest      recycling loopwithout making a single trip to the local      recycling center.    </p>    <p>      Are you hesitant? Does it sound like a messy job, only for      those dedicated gardeners with monstrous compost piles?      Then let us offer for your consideration four effective,      tidy ways to convert your food waste to soil builder.    </p><p><strong>     1. The Trench</strong>      If you have a garden, you can bury your scraps right there      and let them compost underground. Just keep your kitchen      scraps in a plastic bucket with a lid.    </p>    <p>      Potato peels, citrus rinds, greens, leftover vegetables,      eggshells and bread - just about any nonmeat food      residues can be easily composted. Whenever the bucket      starts to get full, take it out to the garden, dig a ditch      between the rows of one of your crops or in a currently      unused bed, dump the garbage in and cover it up. The scraps      will decompose in situ and add their nutrients to the soil.    </p>    <p>      You wouldn't want to plant directly above a      trench-composted area for six weeks or so, until the      leftovers have had a chance to compost, but growing crops      don't mind a few scraps between their rows.    </p>    <p>      This is the simplest and most direct way for home gardeners      to recycle their food wastes. It only has one hitch:      winter. It's pretty hard to trench compost in December if      you live in an area where the ground freezes.    </p>    <p>      2.<strong>The Disposal</strong>This composter consists of      two cylinders made from drainage tiles, buried to      three-quarter depth. You simply take your food scraps      outside and dump them in one of the tile disposals. When      it's full, start on the other. By the time the second one      loads up, the contents of the original tile should have      decomposed to usable humus.    </p>    <p>      First round up a pair of 18"-diameter clay drain tiles      (available at many building-supply stores. Then, for each      tile, dig a <em>wide</em> hole in well-drained ground. Line      the bottom of the opening with brick, cement or scrap      metal-you'll need to leave a few gaps for drainage,      but make them small enough to exclude vermin. Slide the      tile in and backfill.    </p>    <p>      Each disposal will need a lid. These are easily made from      two nailed-together circles of wood-one that fits in,      to plug the tile, and one that fits over it.    </p>        <p>      <strong>3. Indoor Compost</strong>    </p>    <p>      This one is a boon for the apartment dweller, because it      doesn't require a yard or garden. It does, however, call      for a modicum of daily chopping and stirring.    </p>    <p>      We learned about it from Ellie Pruess, a wonderful Virginia      gardener who taught a holistic gardening seminar for      <em>Mother</em> back in 1980. Here's how Ellie described      her method:    </p>    <p>      Vegetables and houseplants will thrive on the balcony of a      city apartment if they're given homemade compost. And      preparing the plant food (which is much easier than making      bread requires only a few minutes a day.    </p>    <p>      You'll need two waterproof containers (each large enough to      hold about a three-week supply of kitchen waste, a stirring      stick and a small bucket of unsterilized s oil from a      friend's garden.    </p>    <p>      The kitchen wastes should be chopped fine or ground in a      blender or food processor. This mash must then be drained      (if wet) and, once a day, put in the bucket and sprinkled      with a layer of garden soil. Next, the mixture is      thoroughly stirred to aerate it. (This last step is      important because it introduces oxygen, which will keep the      odor-causing anaer obic bacteria from multiplying.)    </p>    <p>      After about two weeks, stop adding fresh garbage and start      a new pail in the same way. Give the first batch a stir      every day, all the way to the bottom of the pail. After      another two weeks, it will be transformed into a rich,      crumbly compost . . . smelling good and ready to put on      your potted plants.    </p>    <p>      If fruit flies become a problem, diatomaceous earth may be      sprinkled over the surface immediately after stirring, or a      rotenone spray may be applied.    </p>    <p>      A rank smell emanating from your compost pail means you are      probably culturing the wrong kind of bacteria. This could      be caused by waterlogging (which shuts out air. Drain any      moisture from the pail and stir the compost thoroughly to      fluff it up.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, if your compost gets too dry, the whole      process of decomposition will stop. So keep it damp, but      not soggy.    </p>    <p>      Once your first batch is finished, you'll no longer need      topsoil in order to make new compost: Just add a      sprinkling, each day, of the previous batch to get the      right bacteria started.    </p>    <p>      With two containers going, you'll have a continuous supply      of compost year-round. And, if you make more than you can      use, just wrap it up in pretty paper and give it as a gift      to a gardening friend.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4.Worm Power</strong>    </p>        <p>      Now for the one option that requires real courage: Letting      worms eat your garbage. Keep an indoor worm bin (in the      pantry, under a counter, in the basement, and feed the      inhabitants your daily refuse.    </p>    <p>      Consider the advantages: Silent. Odorless. Low maintenance.      And what do you get? Premium vermicompost, the plant      booster par excellence. Throw your vegetable waste in the      bin once or twice a week. Then, every few months, harvest      the compost and add some new bedding to replace it.    </p>    <p>      Though running an indoor worm farm is a snap, setting it up      does take some effort. To get started, keep your kitchen      waste in a bucket for a couple of weeks, then weigh it to      figure out how many pounds of garbage you produce each      week. Your worm bin should provide approximately one square      foot of surface per pound of garbage you'll bury each week.      An 8" x 2' x 2' box (a four-pounder) will do for most one-      or two-person households.    </p>        <p>      Build your box out of exterior-grade plywood (make it wide,      not tall: The worms you'll use are surface feeders. Drill      nine 1/2" drainage holes in the bottom, and prop the bin up      slightly on blocks. Shred enough paper newsprint, computer      printout or corrugated cardboard to fill the bin. (Leaf      mold also works. You might add some peat moss to the paper      to aid moisture retention. Weigh the bedding and add three      pounds of water per pound of paper to give the material a      75 % moisture content. For instance, an 8" x 2' x 4." box      requires 5-1/3 pounds of dry bedding, hence 16 pounds of      water (about two gallons). Then mix in a couple of handfuls      of soil to give the crawlers some grit.    </p>    <p>      You're ready for worms, which you can order by mail. Go for      red wrigglers <em>(Eisenia foetida</em> or <em>Lumbricus      rubellus).</em> You'll want two pounds of worms for every      pound of garbage you produce a day. Once you've added the      worms, cover the surface of the box loosely with black      plastic.    </p>    <p>      That's it. Now all you do is dump your garbage into the bin      regularly: You can dig a hole and bury it or spread it on      top. Add a little water if the bedding is dry. After a      couple of months, when the bed's become mostly dark      castings (worm manure, it's time to harvest some      vermicompost. Take most of it out, worms and all, replacing      it with fresh bedding, and use the compost in your garden.      Or shove all the castings to one side and put clean, moist      bedding on the other. Most of the worms will migrate to the      new territory in a week or two. Then you can harvest and      use the relatively uninhabited plant booster.    </p>    <h3>One, Two, Three, Four</h3>    <p>      Food scraps are just fifth on the list of our country's      greatest trash sources (behind paper products, yard waste,      metals and glass. And they add up - over 100 pounds      per person a year for a national total of 25 billion pounds      a year. That's 25 billion pounds of solidified sunlight,      captured in carbon, ready and waiting to clutter a      landfill-or go back into the greening of the planet.    </p>
