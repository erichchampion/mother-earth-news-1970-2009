                <p>      REPORT FROM AMERICA    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by JOHN POPPY    </h5>    <p>      <em>Back- to-the-landers vs. the Feds</em>    </p>    <p>      SAN FRANCISCO, CA- <em>The two citizens had to look      up to talk to the judge in his midnight robes on the dais      above them. They, like the judge, had dressed in character.      The man wore a blue denim</em> fleece-lined jacket, tan      chinos, calf-high boots; his wife a tan skirt,      open-collared shirt and lowheeled shoes. The U.S. District      Court loomed around them, 19 floors above Golden Gate      Avenue in San Francisco.    </p>    <p>      One might suppose the setting would shrink them-and      if not the setting, the task they'd set for themselves:      Alone, without a lawyer or even a friend who could afford      to come down from the woods to stand beside them on this      day in March, they were suing the government of the United      States of America to force it to let them cultivate a      garden, drink the water and live in peace on 16O acres of      their own land.    </p>    <p>      They didn't shrink a bit as they asked this latest of the      judges they'd faced to shift the weight of the system to      their side. Bill Rogers stands five feet ten; Janet Rogers      almost as tall. They talked rapidly, urgently, observing      the forms ("If it please Your Honor ...with your      permission..."). Judge Thelton E. Henderson returned their      courtesy. He promised he'd review their file and issue      orders concerning procedure-were they in the right      federal district, should they be in federal court at all      and so forth. They thanked him and left, allowing      themselves a moment of hope even though every government      procedure they'd encountered in the past decade adds to      Bill Rogers's bitter conclusion: "We're living the American      Dream in reverse."    </p>    <p>      Part of the problem is that the U.S. Forest Service has the      Rogerses surrounded. In March 1977, they bought their 160      acres, knowing it was within the Six Rivers National Forest      in far northern California, but not knowing the events that      lay ahead. They maintain that the Forest Service has been      pointedly harassing them and thousands of other "inholders"      across the nation - people who own property inside      areas managed by the government - in order to      discourage them, set up "precondemnation blight" and force      them off their land. Whether or not anyone can prove the      Feds are that well-coordinated or are molesting that many      people in such ways, the Rogerses tell a tale that suggests      frontier justice is still a fact of life in the remote      areas of modern America.    </p>    <p>      Jan and Bill went to high school in Los Angeles in the      '60s. Even as teenagers they knew what they wanted. "We      were living in the wrong place," Jan says. To their      parents' dismay, they opened a joint bank account to save      up for a piece of land closer to wilderness.    </p>    <p>      They found it in the rugged, sparsely populated      northwestern tip of California. First stop was a house in      Zenia, population five. From there they scouted out the      dream property they eventually bought in 1977. It sits at      4,000 feet on a ridgetop known as Little Round Mountain,      half forested with oaks and firs, half meadowland. The      nearest neighbors live more than two miles away.    </p>    <p>      They began cleaning out wells and ponds, planting fruit      trees and vegetables and setting up shelter. Even in this      remnant of the frontier, they soon discovered, they had      opponents. Cattle strayed in, ate and broke things, brought      flies and mess and fouled the water. The pesky cows      belonged to a rancher who had a grazing permit on the      surrounding Forest Service land. Bill and Jan asked him to      keep his animals off their property, as the permit required      him to do. They asked local Forest Service agents to      enforce the regulation. Next thing they knew, the Forest      Service had increased the number of cattle on the rancher's      permit, and the nuisance grew worse. Complaint ...      increase, complaint . . . increase; the couple claims the      sequence occurred several times. The cattle kept coming: 22      intrusions between I982 and) 1985, according to one list      Bill and Jan sent the foresters.    </p>    <p>      Hunters tramped through, shooting and carrying on. The      cattle rancher roared in and out in a four-wheel-drive      vehicle, looking for cows, he said. To Bill and Jan the      Forest Service appeared unwilling, to say the least, to      help them restrain the traffic. Besides making them feel      besieged, all of this got in the way of the couple's      livelihood:    </p>    <p>      hauling water (for forest-fire fighters, among others,      blasting (for heavy construction, stump removal and the      like and renting out big storage containers.    </p>    <p>      The problems with cattle and hunters turned into a running      wrangle over a road on a Forest Service easement through      the Rogers's property. This road provided a prime access      point for the marauders. Bill and Jan wanted to put a gate      across it. Request refused: can't restrict "public access."      But, Bill and Jan said, we won't lock the gate. Besides,      what "public"? The road stops at a washout and log      barricade just beyond our place, so it leads where nobody      but us ever goes. Refused. It's our land, the Rogerses      said. No, it's our easement, the Forest Service said.    </p>    <p>      Well, the Rogerses put up a gate anyway. After years of      argument, on the morning of December 12 1988, two Forest      Service agents-at least one of them armed-three      Trinity County sheriffs deputies and a contractor came out      with a back hoe to tear the gate down.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cops crowd in as if they've caught a murderer.They      haul Sill's Bill's arms behind him,crank on handcuffs (so      tightly that he loses circulation) and push him into a      police car.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before long, nine sympathetic neighbors showed up to serve      as witnesses for Jan and Bill. One brought along a video      camera. Nobody stopped him from using it.    </p>    <p>      The tape of the next couple of hours shows Bill greeting      the agent by opening the gate and saying, "I want you fully      within my property while we talk." He chains himself to the      gate, which is decorated with a wreath and a little      American flag. "I demand you get off my property now," he      says. Jan chains herself to the gate, as does another      woman. The agent speaks so quietly that the microphone      seldom picks up his words. Bill, on the other hand, speaks      his piece clearly. "There are no court documents, we have      not been given a trial, we have not been given anything      that legalizes this process," he declares. "You people are      trespassing. I order you off - now."    </p>    <p>      "I'm standing on a government right-of-way," the agent      says.    </p>    <p>      "Get off my property or put me under arrest," Bill      responds. "Get your documents out, sir    </p>    <p>      The agent the agent shows no documents. Bill asks a deputy      sheriff, whom he knows, "Prevent then from this if they      don't have the documentation, which they don't have."    </p>    <p>      The deputies seem unwilling to arrest anyone. A Forest      Service agent cuts Bill's chain and tells him he's under      arrest. Cops crowd in as if they've caught a murderer. They      haul Bill's arms behind him, crank on handcuffs (so tightly      that he loses circulation and push him into a police car.      Jan sobs loudly at the sight until they turn to her with      the bolt cutters and handcuffs. She doesn't go easily,      falling face down in the dirt, making them half-drag her      away. The cops cuff the neighbor, too, and we see them      being driven away. The tape ends before the backhoe does      its work.    </p>    <p>      After a three-hour ride to jail and an overnight stay      there, the three were driven to a magistrate's office in      Redding, another three hours away, and marched in chains      and handcuffs past the staring citizens of the town.      Following some discussion of the charges, including      interfering with a Federal officer, resisting arrest and      posting NO TRESPASSING signs without a permit, the      government agents put them outside and told them to find      their own way home. The charges against them were later      dismissed.    </p>        <p>      Bill and Jan don't live on the dream property now. They're      back in Zenia, where they feel safer. Bill is convinced the      Forest Service intends to consolidate its holdings and      eliminate private inholders by the year 2000. "And they'll      do it by any method necessary," he says. "Our place is      remote; they can molest us out there behind a green      curtain."    </p>    <p>      <strong>"We have suffered and been deprived of our basic      constitutional rights."</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is just the citizen's side of the story, of course,      and just a beginning; it should be instructive to look      further at the government's side.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, Bill and Jan Rogers are suing, or attempting to      sue, their own government for damages and vindication. "We      have suffered and continue to suffer discrimination,      harassment, abuse of process, loss of our liberty, the      `taking' of our property without just compensation," they      write in the complaint submitted to Judge Henderson, "and      have been deprived of our constitutional rights ...as a      result of a vendetta and conspiracy by petty functionaries      of the Forest Service who have abused their powers. The      petty bureaucrats obviously know that, with the federal      government to back them up, they have all the power and we      apparently have virtually none."    </p>    <p>      Invective aside, that may turn out to be the case. Judge      Henderson, meanwhile, transferred the case to the Eastern      District.    </p>    <p>      Stay tuned.    </p>    <p>      <em>John Poppy, West Coast correspondent for</em> Mother      Earth News, is a columnist for Esquire and a contributing      editor for In Health and Hippocrates.    </p>
