                    <p>      So the air is full of crud and the water tastes funny and      the nine-to-five is a drag. You're tired of the subway, dog      crap in the streets, bumper-to-bumper traffic and plastic      TV dinners. Maybe the communes - with all that fresh air,      sunshine, love and home-baked bread - are really into      something.    </p>    <p>      But how the hell can <em>you</em> do it? T. Leary's "Turn      On, Tune In, Drop Out" is a noble sentiment . . . but it      doesn't lay down much of a blueprint. Is it actually      possible to tell the boss to shove it, square your      shoulders, and step out a free man . . . without starving      to death?    </p>    <p>      Sure. It's easy. The global electronic village is Now! Just      like McLuhan and Theobald and Bucky Fuller keep telling us.      Nobody has to live second hand anymore. The Material      Scarcity world is dead. Long live Free Energy. Time and      Space are now plastic and life is exactly what you make it.    </p>    <p>      Stated most simply, there are two ways of living: (1) Play      the "game." Go for the money first and - assuming you get      it - buy the kind of life you want. Or, (2) kick out the      jams, make your scene right in front, and let the bread      take care of itself.    </p>    <p>      If you've got some money, fine. Your initial choice can be      just that much wider. If you don't have bread, don't sweat      it. That doesn't cramp your style at all. Besides, you can      easily get paid for doing exactly what you want to do      anyway. It doesn't matter if Good Times to you is a      back-to-the-land thing or whether you have eyes for, say,      touring with a name rock group. Either one is cool and      either one is possible. I've done both and other numbers in      between. You can, too.    </p>    <p>      FOR EXAMPLE, this back to nature bit is very big right now      and getting bigger. Let's say you want to get in on the      action, but you have little or no money. Well, no matter      what "they" say, it can be done. The land is <em>not</em>      all taken.    </p>    <p>      Stretched across the upper half of this continent, as      Bradford Angier notes in his book, <em>How</em> <em>To Go      Live In The Woods On $10 A Week</em> <em>,</em> are vast      areas of unspoiled and practically uninhabited wilderness.      It's country "where meat is still free for the hunting,      fish for the catching, fruit and vegetables for the      picking, fuel for the cutting, and a home for the fun of      building." Angier speaks from the firsthand experience of      homesteading in British Columbia, Canada's western - most      province.    </p>    <p>      What about that empty land in Alaska and Canada? Is it      really free? Well . . . technically, no. You're generally      supposed to file a homestead or homesite or somesuch claim,      pay a fee averaging between one and five dollars an acre,      and enter your name on the tax rolls.    </p>    <p>      But that's a drag, so why not do what settlers have always      done on the frontier: squat. Some homesteaders I talked to      in British Columbia recommend it. Just consult an area map      so you won't blunder onto land that's already taken, strike      off into the bush, pick a spot, and build your cabin. If      anybody ever wants to purchase or lease your ground, you -      as a squatter - will be given first chance at legal title      anyway. So why bother with the red tape now?    </p>    <p>      By the way, neither Canada nor Alaska is all ice and snow.      Less snow falls on the panhandle of Alaska than annually      descends on Chicago. Far north gardens are fantastic with      washtub-size cabbages, and some wild fruit grows so      thickly, it's considered a nuisance. The Queen Charlotte      Islands off British Columbia's coast combine an exceedingly      mild climate and a one-deer-a-day-per-person legal limit if      your thing is living off the land.    </p>    <p>      If you want out . . . but not <em>that</em> far, check into      the hundreds upon thousands of acres of government land      scattered throughout our own western states. You can, in      effect, call a chunk of it your own if you have a      "legitimate" reason. Roughly translated, that means you      intend to exploit the land in some way.    </p>    <p>      Okay. Play their silly game. In Arizona, for instance, I've      rambled over mile after mind-boggling mile where you can      stake a recognized mining claim by registering with a local      office and digging a hole four by six by ten feet deep.      Naturally, once you've proved your claim in this manner,      you'll want to move right onto the property to keep an eye      on it. To hold the ground, you're required to put in a      hundred dollars worth of improvements plus a few dollars      tax each year.    </p>    <p>      Again, if that's too much trouble, just go out in the hills      and squat. Thousands of others have.    </p>    <p>      If you've got your heart set on legal title to fertile land      that is close to the action of a thriving city . . . that's      possible, too. It won't be completely free, but you can      sometimes pick up an abandoned farm for back taxes. It      requires some sleuthing and finagling, however, and the      easiest way is just to buy a little family farm that an old      couple wants to sell. The <em>Strout</em> and <em>United      Farm Agency</em> catalogues - regularly advertised in the      classified sections of many magazines and newspapers -      always list a number of such farms in all parts of the      country. Some can be purchased for as little as      four-hundred dollars down. Newly organized communes and hip      young couples with eyes for a rural homestead are snapping      them up at an increasing rate.    </p>    <p>      Once you've got your land, what about shelter? It's up to      you: let your imagination soar!    </p>    <p>      Leary and hundreds of others are into the aborigine thing      these days and live in plains Indian tepees. It makes sense      because, unlike white man's tents, a properly constructed      tepee is warm in winter, cool in summer, and able to      withstand windstorms that will flatten a frame house.      Reginald and Gladys Laubin's <em>The Indian Tipi</em> will      steep you in the rich tradition of this practical shelter      and teach you how to build one.    </p>    <p>      If you prefer something more substantial, you can construct      a thoroughly modern ranch house dirt cheap by using just      that - dirt. Even a definitive instruction manual,      <em>Handbook For Building Homes Of Earth, is</em> free from      HUD, Division of International Affairs, Washington, D.C.      The basic structure will cost you little more than y our      labor and, possibly, a few dollars for stabilizing agents.      It beats the hell out of a thirty-year mortgage or monthly      rents of one-hundred-and-twenty-plus.    </p>    <p>      Then again, if you're squatting, chances are there's an      abandoned trapper's or miner's cabin nearby that you can      move into or salvage for a new building. If you put your      money down on a farm, you probably picked one with a      habitable home and serviceable barns.    </p>    <p>      Or, as a number of drop-outs are proving, you can live in a      structure as modern as tomorrow on a very thin shoestring:      by spinning free-span domes from tops hacked out of      discarded auto bodies, some of the new pioneers in the      southwest have combined the best and worst of modern      technology into a sheltering mutation.    </p>    <p>      Since the car tops can be obtained free or for as little as      twenty-five  cents each, a thirty-foot dome can be thrown up      for less than fifty dollars.    </p>    <p>      With land and shelter under your belt, you'll probably want      to turn your attention to food which is several notches      above that polyethylene stuff sold at the supermarket.      Fresh air, sunshine, and a garden where "fruits and      vegetables are free for the picking" go together as      naturally as ham and eggs from your own homestead. A      subscription to Organic Gardening will give you that      proverbial green thumb within a year . . . and teach you      about the chickens, pigs, and cows, too.    </p>    <p>      If grow-your-own intimidates you, you can still live high      harvesting your share of the tons of free-for-the-gathering      food that every square mile of rural America offers. The      best guides to this bounty are Euell Gibbons' three books,      Stalking The Wild Asparagus, <em>Stalking The Blue-Eyed      Scallop, and Stalking The Healthful Herbs</em> .    </p>    <p>      Gibbons regularly eats everything he writes about, and he      covers it all from robbing bee trees to picking berries to      gathering greens to brewing dandelion wine to making rose      petal jam.    </p>    <p>      But then, the nature bit may leave you cold. Let's say you      love your apartment in town, you dote upon restaurant chow,      and all you really need to make your life complete is      travel, new scenes, and far-away places. Fine. You can do      that without money, too . . . and go first class all the      way. The auto drive-away offers one increasingly popular      method.    </p>    <p>      If you're twenty-one and have a valid driver's license, you      can get from almost any large city to almost any point in      the U.S.A. at almost any time by driving a car for someone.      AAACON, Auto Driveaway. and other services handle all the      dirty details and advertise in the "Personal" and      "Transportation" classified sections of the larger      newspapers.    </p>    <p>      You may have to juggle your departure date a little to get      a car that's "full gas paid," but when you do - if you      sleep in the car or camp out along the way - the trip will      cost you only your food. It's even possible to get enough      expense money to cover everything and leave some cash in      your pocket. And remember: You'll have the private use of a      generally expensive personal car. Load it with gear and      forget all the hassles that hitchers put up with. I know      some pretty big rock names that occasionally transport      large quantities of guitars and amps across the country      this way. Once I drove, a series of three luxury cars from      New York City to Anchorage, Alaska, with less than two days      of "down" time for changes . . . and I made money on the      trip.    </p>    <p>      You can also savor the romance of traveling on your thumb .      . . by business and private airplane. I've been doing this      for fifteen years; it's easy.    </p>    <p>      Go out to any medium-large private airfield on a nice day      and station yourself near the flight line, aircraft parking      area, or operations office. When you see someone heading      for a plane in a businesslike manner, ask if he's going      your way. You may pick up a 2,000-mile ride.    </p>    <p>      "But won't I need to know a lot about aviation?" No. Pilots      love to turn greenhorns on to flying, and a lack of      knowledge can be your most endearing quality. If you feel      uncomfortable hanging around airports, though, you can take      a couple of the five-dollar introductory flying lessons      that Piper and Cessna offer. Otherwise, dress neatly and      carry only one very small bag. You'll get rides.    </p>    <p>      If air hitching is not your stroke, how would you like to      be asked to cruise the South Pacific, the Riviera, or even      around the world in a private yacht? Yeah, I know. It's too      good to be true. But it is true.    </p>    <p>      Go to a yacht harbor. The bigger and plusher and more      glamorous, the better. Ala Wai Basin just off Waikiki Beach      in Honolulu used to work superbly for me, and friends      who've thumbed across Europe say the expensive watering      spots along the Mediterranean are great. If you're stuck on      Mainland, U.S.A., find the nearest coastal city that has an      extensive boat scene and go there.    </p>    <p>      Hang around the ocean-going ketches, schooners, and yawls      of forty feet and bigger. If you're warm, breathing, and      can stand up by yourself, you should get two or three      cruise offers a week. A "ride wanted" notice on the harbor      bulletin board can start a stampede.    </p>    <p>      Why? Because a lot of people have made a lot of money      lately and much of that bread has been spent on luxury      yachts. I mean, other than a Learjet, what else is there      for sheer prestige? On the other hand, it takes a crew to      sail one of the damn things, and crews are both expensive      and hard to get unless . . . unless someone can be found      who wants to go to Rio or Cape Town or Tahiti so bad he'll      help man the vessel for the trip, meals, and - maybe -      fifty dollars on top. And that's exactly where you come in.    </p>    <p>      So okay. So it is possible to break loose . . . but where's      the bread going to come from? Can you actually do exactly      what you want and still coy the loot? Damn right. In fact,      you're more likely to make vast quantities of cash if you      <em>are</em> joyfully in tune with yourself.    </p>    <p>      This is the electronic Information Age. Anything you know      is a marketable commodity. Go where your fancy leads you.      Develop the skills and cultivate the interests you want to      have. Then trade that specialized knowledge for the money      that others will be eager to force on you.    </p>    <p>      Bradford Angier dropped out to a remote cabin in the      Canadian Rockies . . . and made a small fortune writing      about it. My old lady is hung up on English saddle-bred      horses. She knows so much about them she can now instruct      ten riding students at a time at five bucks each. I dig, of      all things, little do-it-yourself one- and two-man      airplanes that you build at home, and I make a      better-than-average living dealing information about them.    </p>    <p>      Go where you want to be and pick up the free percentage      that's always there. You'll soon be considered an authority      or a craftsman or - at the very least - a fixture in your      chosen field. When the money comes down, you'll get your      share.    </p>    <p>      And you'll also get some juicy, unexpected spinoffs. Like a      two-month all-expenses-plus-pay tour of Europe with the      people you love. I did, anyway, and it happened because I      dug folk music when it was big and I spent a lot of time in      the coffee houses where it was played. Gradually I came to      know - and became very tight with - a number of musicians.      Since I was about the only one in the crowd who didn't      perform, guess who was a logical choice when The Bitter End      Singers needed a road manager for their European trip?      That's right.    </p>    <p>      And the moral of the story is simply this: You <em>can</em>      get out of the pigeonhole "they" want to keep you in and      you <em>can</em> live exactly the dream life you want. Just      do it.    </p>
