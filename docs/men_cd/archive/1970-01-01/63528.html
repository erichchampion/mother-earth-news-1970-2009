                    <p>      It's a little dated now, but the $1.00-a-week food plan is      still good.<br />      Copyright: Victor A. Croley    </p><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>    <p>      <em>"If a man does not keep pace with his companions,      perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him      step to the music he hears, however measured or far away.      "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Henry David Thoreau</em>    </p>    <p>      Two fearful explosions, coming as a complete surprise to a      bewildered world, changed the course of the world and the      lives of everyone in it - including your life - and      heralded the beginning of the Atomic Age. Civilization as      we know it was doomed when the echoes of those atomic bomb      blasts in Japan died away. What next?    </p>    <p>      The world asked that question. It is still asking it. Of      what use to build magnificent, costly cities, if they can      be wiped out in a jiffy? Of what use to struggle and strive      to build up a fortune, if in the flash of an eyelid      everything - including life itself - can be wiped out?    </p>    <p>      We are now at that uncertain stage in life. We are      confused. We are afraid. We are bewildered. We cringe. We      don't know what to do next. We are afraid we may not only      lose our possessions; we are afraid for our lives.    </p>    <p>      It has been said so often that it has become an axiom and      even a proverb, that some good comes out of every bad.      Another axiom is to the effect that every weapon carries      with it its own defense. And if you will couple these two      proverbial expressions, do a little thinking to get your      ideas straight, you will have the answer to survival in an      atomic age. Let a good life come to you from this bad omen      for civilization, and use the only weapon against the      atomic bomb which has ever been devised.    </p>    <p>      The good life? It is unquestionably the simple life - and      more and more each day Americans are turning to it, in one      form or another, grateful that there is an escape from the      complexities and problems of modern city living.    </p>    <p>      And the defense against the atomic bomb? It is one simple      but inexorable thing - space. For, don't you see, if you      are not near enough where an atomic bomb may explode to be      harmed by it, in your life it is harmless.    </p>    <p>      Therefore if you find a better life in the simple life, far      enough away from the crowded cities to be uninteresting to      the men who launch atomic attacks, you can survive. More:      you can find a new measure of satisfaction in living by      getting back to the simple form of living.    </p>    <p>      There's nothing new in this. A hundred years and more ago a      lean, lanky, hawk-nosed New England philosopher and writer      wrote an entire book about it. The book was called WALDEN.      It was so unpopular in its day that the author - Henry      David Thoreau - had to publish it at his own expense, and      was left with most of the books on his hands. Once he wrote      a friend: "I own a library of 712 books, 700 of which I      wrote myself," - the unsold copies of WALDEN, a book about      the simple life.<br />    </p>    <p>      Nobody was interested in the simple life then. Everybody      wanted the complicated life - build big cities, build big      fortunes, surround yourself with possessions and servants,      and outdo your neighbors. So Thoreau's voice was literally      one crying in the wilderness.    </p>    <p>      But see what has happened in the last century. No writer is      more respected than Thoreau, no book is read more devotedly      by intelligent people who have discovered it than WALDEN.      Maybe too late it has dawned on us that in this life which      Thoreau championed, the simple life, the life of time and      leisure and thought and good things which do not cost much      money, there is the best life a human being can find.    </p>    <p>      And, as you read a short time ago, it is not only the good      life now; it may be the only life a man can lead and      preserve his life, because always over us like a pall of      smoke is the threat of sudden, devastating, complete atomic      attack.    </p>    <p>      But suppose such an attack doesn't come. We are still      likely any day to wake up to the fact that our ancient and      powerful enemy, Depression, is riding again. Remember the      Depression which set in in 1929? Remember bread lines?      Apple sellers on the street corners? Leaf rakers? Suicides      among the once wealthy men? Pinched faces on the street?      Worry and woe and the fear that you might never eat again?    </p>    <p>      The simple life will help obviate that. Better than money      in the bank, bonds in the safety deposit vault, credit at      the stores are the things with which you live surrounded      when you live the simple life.    </p>    <p>      This, then, is your guide to getting back to the simple      life; a practical everyday manual which will help you to      put your feet astride the path that leads to the only life      that, since the beginning of man's stay on earth, has led      to his complete development and satisfaction--the simple      life!    </p>    <p>      <strong>SECTION I</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT IS THE SIMPLE LIFE AND WHY YOU SHOULD LEAD      IT</strong><br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"Our life is frittered away by detail. . . Simplify,      simplify. "</em><br />      - <em>Thoreau</em><br />      The literal meaning of the word civilization is life in the      city, and when we speak of the growth of civilization, we      mean the growth of urban or city life. Unfortunately, city      life is tempting, alluring, and so in ever-increasing      numbers people turn to it.    </p>    <p>      But it isn't the most wholesome nor the most enduring form      of life, and now, what with the threats you read about in      the introduction, civilization is facing its gravest peril      since the time when Ghengis Khan and Tamerlane just about      wiped it out with their barbaric hordes.<br />    </p>    <p>      When you read in the papers that the atomic bomb can      destroy civilization it doesn't mean that everybody alive      on earth will be wiped out. It means only those who are in      the easy path of atomic bombs - that is to say, living in      crowded cities - will be destroyed. If you destroy the      cities, therefore, you destroy civilization. You have the      choice of being destroyed, if the cities are attacked, or      of saving your life. To save it, merely get far enough away      so that the attack will not carry you in its wake. See how      simple it is, how practical, how obvious to survive in an      atomic world?    </p>    <p>      The simple life is merely the life which gives up the      complexities and useless possessions of modern city life.      It doesn't mean reverting to savagery, eating raw meat, not      washing. It, indeed, means leading a fuller life than you      lead now - as ever so many educated, intelligent people who      have willingly gone back to the simple life will tell you.    </p>    <p>      There's that brilliant editor of Mears, Michigan, Swift      Lathers, for your first exhibit. As long ago as 1912, Swift      Lathers, law-trained, far-sighted, looked on city life,      turned his back against it, moved to an isolated little      village in the dune country on Lake Michigan, and started a      newspaper which is still the smallest weekly newspaper in      the world.    </p>    <p>      "Consider me at my age," he recently asked his youngest      son, Nathan, in describing the kind of life he hopes the      boy will lead. "What do I need? What do I want? Firewood,      food, shelter from the wind, a shelf of books, chess and      two good feet that will let me walk fifteen miles on a      March afternoon in the solitudes of the dunes. Night comes      and the smell of potatoes frying for supper. And the patter      of little children coming to spaghetti.    </p>    <p>      "There, Nathan, you have the recipe for a happy life. We      seek fire, food, shelter and riches of the mind. We have to      live only one day at a time. But every day should have a      little bit of heaven. And that might be five minute's time      to sit down on a rock in a new mown meadow or a half hour      of quiet reading solitude with Thoreau."    </p>    <p>      Another city man who decided on the simple life was Ted      Richmond. After years of struggle in cities of the South,      he bought a poor, worn-out 10-acre farm near Jasper,      Arkansas, in one of the last frontiers in America. He was a      city man, with soft hands, a liking for bright lights and      movies, and his friends all thought him touched.    </p>    <p>      After he had been living the simple life for a year, his      friend, Charles Morrow Wilson, visited him. He found      Richmond completely remade in health, in outlook on life,      in the measure of happiness he found. And he was living so      economically that his cash outlay for his flourishing life      was less than $100 a year, for everything. And yet he was      living better, more fully than when he was earning much      more in the city, and spending it all for "a living."    </p>    <p>      Another: George Livingston Baker. He had the further      handicap of no money and 64 years of age when he set out to      live the simple life in the Colorado Rockies above Denver.      Less than $100 to his name he owned, and he was ill      besides. But did he ever regret it? Not for a minute. At      the age of 75 he is still going strong, cooking his own      food, cutting his own wood, and making his adequate living      in the ways that fill every day with satisfaction and      adventure.    </p>    <p>      One thing you will get out of the simple life is greater      satisfaction in living. In the city the majority of the      people are bored. "Let's get together soon," they tell one      another. "How about a movie tonight?" "What's there to do      around this joint, anyway?" "What'll we do now?" "I hate      Sundays - they bore me," - you hear these expressions on      every side.    </p>    <p>      But no one who moves away from all that and gets back to      the simple life is ever bored for a minute. C.W. Whitemore      discovered that years ago. Whipped out by life in      Philadelphia, "with axe, pick axe, and saw I came here (to      the Pitts Hill Road in the Berkshires) and decided to      build." He earned $1 a week as correspondent for a weekly      paper, lived on that practically, and a year later wrote:      "I am the wealthiest resident on Pitts Hill Road!" He never      had a bored minute, always found an entrancing panorama of      Nature, whatever the season, found treasure there he never      found in the city.    </p>    <p>      And health, too. Bob Davis, the roving correspondent who      looked in on everything interesting, discovered his      healthiest man on Caledesi Key, Florida - Henry Sherrer.    </p>    <p>      "It is difficult to believe that this amazing man is in his      seventy-eighth year; that his diet is bread, eggs, bananas,      and an occasional cereal; that six hours of sleep is enough      to refresh him," exclaimed Mr. Davis. "He reads without the      aid of glasses and can hear a mile away the cooing of a      turtle dove.    </p>    <p>      "The chest of him is like a cask, his arms are as iron and      the muscles between his shoulder blades ripple when he      strides. The clasp of his hand is viselike, and his voice      rich with kindly intonations."    </p>    <p>      Maybe you have thought often - who among us hasn't? - of      leading such a life. Maybe you wondered, living where you      do in a large city or a small town that seems to offer no      opportunity to break civilization's shackles, how, in the      first place, you could do it, and where, in the second.    </p>    <p>      If that has been your problem, you can take heart from this      fact - that there are smart men and women leading the      simple life everywhere in the world; yes, right on the      outskirts of the largest cities. You don't have to traipse      off to Mexico or the Andes or Morocco, cut all ties with      the phases of your life you like, in order to lead the      simple life. All you have to do is make a minor change-in      the way that will be discribed in the next Section.<br />      <strong>SECTION II</strong><br />      <strong>WHERE YOU CAN LEAD THE SIMPLE LIFE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"If one advances confidently in the direction of his      dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has      imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected..."</em>    </p>    <p>      - <em>Thoreau</em>    </p>    <p>      Next to the question of deciding that you are going to lead      the simple life, come what will, is that of deciding just      where you will live it. The very phrase simple life      connotes getting away from it all, up into the fastness of      the mountains or on the far-flung desert, and you are      wondering, with your slim resources and dependence upon      being where you can sell your skill, whether you're quite      ready to make drastic breaks such as this would entail.    </p>    <p>      You needn't worry about that part of it, because the fact      is that the important thing is to want to lead this sort of      life. Given that, places where you can live it abound.    </p>    <p>      Near large cities? Within twenty, thirty minutes of the      largest cities you will find men and women living it. In      any state?    </p>    <p>      Why not? One state is as good as another, although in the      West, where there are vast areas of public domain in the      form of national forests, it is easier to find land, and      cheaper, because, as you will read in due time, you can      lease from the Government sufficient land for simple living      for as little as $5 a year - but that isn't the only kind      of land on which you can live this simple life.    </p>    <p>      For instance, as long ago as ten years, there was a young      Englishman working as a clerk in a London bank. If you      think the city in which you live is crowded, try living and      making your way in London once. And if you think the      countryside around where you live is settled up, try      finding a place without people near London; almost anywhere      in Europe, for that matter.    </p>    <p>      But this young chap was determined he was going to get away      from the city. He managed it easily enough; he merely      rented enough room for his tent from a friendly farmer,      paid him a few pennies a day rent is all. "It is a      delightful country, beautiful and quiet."    </p>    <p>      From this beautiful and quiet countryside the clerk      commutes to crowded, dirty London every day. When he's done      with work, he hies back to his simple life-his quarters,      winter and summer, consist of a tent 7x10 feet in size. It      is furnished with a bunk along one side, a small trunk and      a converted sugar box which he uses as a larder and      kitchenette. Living thus simply, he has reduced expenses to      a minimum-and raised satisfaction in living to a maximum.      And all within 20 miles of the world's largest city.    </p>    <p>      Or New York City. It would be pretty hard to find a place      close to that city where this sort of life could be lived,      you would think, wouldn't you? But two girls, secretaries      in downtown offices, have managed it. They, too, rent from      a friendly farmer, live ecstatically and very economically      in a small cabin, built with their own hands. George Baker,      whose story you have partially learned in Section I, the      64-year-old man who found ease and peace and satisfaction      in the simple life, chose a spot in the mountains forty      miles west of Denver, Colorado. He didn't buy his 14 acres.      He leased it from the Forest Service at $1 per month.    </p>    <p>      At the other end, to show you how you can fit this simple      life into any scheme of living you fancy, there's a man      named Clark Richardson who, tired of the city, tired of      being broke, tired of working and having so little to show      for it, decided that for him the real wilderness life was      the thing.    </p>    <p>      He had managed to save only $500, no more, but that was      enough to get him past the Canadian Government officials,      who screen those who enter their country. With that $500 he      was able to "retire" permanently. He built a cabin on      rented ground in British Columbia, and earns enough working      by the day for a few weeks a year to live in comfort and      satisfaction for the rest of the time.    </p>    <p>      So don't hold back from making your leap into simple living      because you happen now to live in a large city. Either move      to the spot where you have always fancied you would like to      live, or, if circumstances require you to be in the city      for business each day, move out of the city far enough to      find the sort of living you want. Don't say it can't be      done. It can. Hundreds have done it. How do you know you      can't until you have tried it yourself?    </p>    <p>      In this country for the past dozen years there has been a      back-tothe-land movement that has elicited the cooperation      of the Government in Washington. Shortly after World War      II, for instance, the Goverment opened up tracts of five      acres, under the Five-Acre Tract law, passed in 1938, in      the desert of California. Hundreds of families and      individuals have leased these tracts at $5 per year, $1 per      acre per year. The requirements are not strict. The Act      merely requires that you state the purpose for which the      land is to be used. It can only be used as a home, camp,      cabin, health, convalescent, recreational or business site,      and not for farming. You have also to prove that you have      financial responsibility to maintain yourself and carry out      the undertaking for which you propose to use the land.    </p>    <p>      Information about where to write for such land is included      in Section VII. There also you will find information about      other Government lands which are available for your use in      living the simple life.    </p>    <p>      But don't worry too much if there isn't public land near      where you are. There's land. That is all that counts,      because if you are persistent and earnest about it you can      find a place for your experiment, all right. The main thing      is, are you in earnest?    </p>    <p>      If you are, you are ready to read Section III. It tells you      just how you can live this simple life, what kind of house      or other shelter you can live in, and how easy it is to      provide yourself with the essentials of a roof over your      head.<br />      <strong>SECTION III<br /></strong> <strong><br />      HOW YOU CAN LIVE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called      comforts,</em> of <em>life are . . . positive hindrances.      "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Thoreau</em><br />Your first requirement, of course, in leading the simple    life, in going back to it, is to have something to live the    simple life in. In other words, shelter. You have been used,    maybe for your entire life, to apartments, hotel rooms, city    dwellings, so you know what rent means. Budget experts figure    on 25 per cent of the income for this one item of shelter    alone. So if you have been earning $400 a month, you have    been accustomed to laying $100 a month at least on the line    for rent. Chances are, what with rents inflated like    everything else, you have been paying out more than a fourth    of your income for the mere sake of a roof between you and    the stars.		</p>    <p>      You are concerned about going back to the simple life for      fear you can't afford what it costs, if you cut yourself      loose from your income.    </p>    <p>      Is that one of your misgivings?    </p>    <p>      Forget your past conceptions of what it costs for shelter,      because the simple life implies that you can get along with      a different kind of shelter; one which is just as good but      which costs you just a fraction.    </p>    <p>      Part of the fun of the simple life is cutting yourself      clear away from old ideas. Instead, for example, of living      in a city apartment, at $125 per month, with its varnished      floors, steam radiators, and janitor service, you get as      far away from that as you can, and live in the simplest      shelter imagimable.    </p>    <p>      Why, you might even live in a cave! It sounds preposterous      at first, but many persons have done and do it. Pat Lynch,      born into an aristocratic Irish family, ran away from home,      sailed the seven seas, then settled down in an isolated      valley in the Rocky Mountains, still named Pat's Hole in      his honor. He couldn't be bothered about building a house,      so he cleaned out and patched up a natural cave just above      the river. Here he lived in blissful comfort for 50 years.      During his latter dayshe died at the age of 98 just a few      years ago, hale and hearty to the end-some of his neighbors      "took pity on the poor old man", built him a tidy log      cabin, and moved Pat and his effects into it. But he didn't      like it. He went back to his hole in the cliff. Those who      visited him there found it neat as a pin, clean, sunny, and      bright; as good a home as any human being could want.    </p>    <p>      It shows one thing, what can be done. Chances are you will      want a different kind of shelter, and no reason why you      cannot have one for little or no cost.    </p>    <p>      For example, the market abounds with U.S. Army tents,      sixteen feet square, made of the best canvas procurable.      With sidewalls of lumber and lumber flooring, these      pyramidal tents of the Army are as good a home for a simple      liver as anyone could want, light, airy, wind-resistant,      warm.    </p>    <p>      What about winter in a tent? All right, what about winter      in a tent. No one can answer that better than a simple      liver who tried it, and here is the experience of Mr. and      Mrs. Charles H. Macomber. Thomas Drier tells about how they      managed it: "If as some philosophers have said, we are rich      according to the number of things we can get along without,      Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Macomber are multimillionaires.      They lived in a tent all last winter near Plymouth, New      Hampshire. One time the temperature got as low as 32      degrees below zero. Attempts were made to persuade the      Macombers to move into a house, but they protested they      were entirely comfortable and neither they, nor their cat      "Mittens", nor their dog "Peaches" had any desire to desert      their tent.    </p>    <p>      A trailer makes a fine home for a simple liver, and used      trailers are going onto the market in increasing numbers      now that the housing shortage is being relieved. Out in the      west are ever so many persons who swear that a sheep wagon      is the best place on earth for a human being to live, the      most compact, the most comfortable, the most friendly.      Frank Robbins of Glenrock, Wyoming, for instance, has spent      maybe half his life in sheep wagons, on the bleakest,      coldest, windiest spots in Wyoming. He never suffered, and      although he owns a comfortable ranch house near town, he      prefers living in his sheep wagon. Life there, he says, is      simpler. It is reduced to its elements. It is beautiful.    </p>    <p>      But if you want a permanent home-if you have the AngloSaxon      feeling that only when a man lives underneath his own roof      does he live-why that opens up a whole new field of delight      for you.    </p>    <p>      Build your own home. Let it be, according to the locale in      which you build it, a log cabin, an adobe house, a rammed      earth dwelling, even one made of bamboo or palm fronds. But      if you build it yourself, you will enjoy it the more. And      how do you know you can't build a perfectly satisfactory      home for yourself?    </p>    <p>      There are dozens of cheap manuals on log cabin, rammed      earth, adobe, or other construction on the market, and the      best advice you can receive is to buy yourself one of these      books, live with it until you know it practically by heart,      and then-go to it.    </p>    <p>      While you are building your home, you can live in a cave or      in a simple tent. George Baker, for instance, who has been      introduced to you before and whom you will meet again in      the next chapters, because he is such a paragon of all the      pioneer virtues which make simple living practicable, did      that. He had an 8x 10 wall tent. This he pitched on his      rented homesite. In it he lived all one summer while he      fashioned a oneroom log cabin with his hands. He said that      no period of his life gave him greater enjoyment than the      weeks he was arising early, working late on the first home      of his own he ever built.    </p>    <p>      You don't need much equipment to do the rough and ready      building you are going to do. And you might, like Thoreau,      even borrow what you need, but if you do, do be as careful      as he was when he returned his borrowed tools to have them      sharper and in better shape than before!    </p>    <p>      Mr. Baker, when he built his house, had the most meager      kind of outfit. He had: a shovel, a hoe, an ax, a belt      hatchet, one crosscut saw, one panel saw, a brace and two      bits, a sharpening stone, and two files: And that was all.    </p>    <p>      His personal outfit, while we are on it, because you will      need a personal outfit yourself, you know, consisted of the      following: 3 pairs of U.S. Army blankets, bought second      hand; one Hudson's Bay blanket, a canvas tarpaulin, sheet      iron stove, set of cooking utensils, water pail, water bag,      and small wash tub.    </p>    <p>      In clothing he has a sheeplined coat, an army hat, several      pair of heavy shoes, socks, an extra pair of trousers, two      suits of underwear, an overcoat, one slicker.    </p>    <p>      Don't let not having S 100,000 in government bonds or two      or three business blocks hold you back from leading the      simple life. Your shelter is going to cost you next to      nothing-after you get your cabin built $3 to $5 per month      is going to take care of that. And your actual living, food      to eat, other expenses which are inevitable to a human      being as long as his breath holds out, are not going to      cost you much more.    </p>    <p>      The few dollars it is going to cost you per month to live      you are going to have little trouble in getting, as you      will see when you read the next Sections.<br />      <strong>SECTION IV<br /></strong> <strong><br />      FOOD AT SMALL COST</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"We can call always fire on less, when we have more to      live</em> <em>for. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>- Stephen McKenney</em><br />Maybe you have yearned for years to lead this simple    life, but have been afraid you weren't ready for it, because    you did not have an assured income from investment of from    $100 to $1,000 per month, depending upon the extravagance of    your tastes or your experience in what constitutes a living    in a modern city or town.		</p>    <p>      Revise your concept of what a living means and you can live      like a king on very little, for much less, as a matter of      fact, than $1 a day. And anyone can earn $1 a day      regardless of where he is, regardless of how unskilled he      is, because $1 a day can be picked up with just a few hours      work a week.    </p>    <p>      You are used to grocery bills running $100 a month and up,      but it doesn't cost more than 10 per cent of that to      sustain life and health and keep you well nourished. The      trick is to buy simple foods, which are always inexpensive,      instead of fancy foods which are always dear.    </p>    <p>      Not only will these simple foods cost you less money, but      they will nourish you better and actually keep you at a      higher level of health.    </p>    <p>      A man named Frank Tarbeaux was convicted of some petty      crime in England a number of years ago, sent to prison for      27 months. He had been a successful gambler, a high liver,      and what they fed him in prison at first dismayed him. He      thought surely he would die of starvation, either that or      boredom, because the meals were all the same.    </p>    <p>      For breakfast and supper he and his fellow prisoners      received a bowl of oatmeal, a chunk of bread, a jug of      water; at noon they received bread and a large bowl of      soup. And he thought he was badly treated. But after a few      months such health as he had never known came to him, and      when he was discharged and wrote a fabulous story of his      life, he declared: "I am grateful to that sanitarium."    </p>    <p>      Of course, it isn't necessary for anyone to go to jail to      learn and practice the benefits of simple fare. Just let      him live on a few  cents a day, confine his purchases to      items which can be kept within, say, 50  cents a day for      everything under today's higher prices.    </p>    <p>      Seven or eight years ago a research foundation in      Minneapolis interested in proper nutrition, made a study of      the actual cost to maintain a human being in the peak of      health and fitness. The foundation concluded: "The average      normal American needs only a few pounds of food a day. He      can buy it at an average cost of eight  cents per pound. He      can be amply nourished, if he will build his diet around a      few simple plentiful foods.    </p>    <p>      "Millions of low income and moderate income American      families are undernourished because of wasteful spending of      their food money," the report continues, "which in turn is      the result partly of 'over-civilized' eating habits and      partly of lack of education in food values. Much of their      precious food money goes for items of little food value -      'taste-ticklers' and stimulants."    </p>    <p>      As to what is needed, these are the essential or protective      foods: a pound of whole wheat foods and a pint of milk a      day, which will supply most of the proteins, vitamins, and      minerals needed for healthful, vigorous living. This basic      diet can be fortified, according to this report, with an      occasional orange or can of tomato juice and a bit of fatty      meat two or three times a week.    </p>    <p>      When this report was issued, the cost per pound of      essential foods was around eight  cents. Say it has doubled      since. That makes only 16 to 20  cents per pound.    </p>    <p>      Current prices on essential low-cost foods as this was      being written, in a large city market, ran: Soy beans, 18       cents a pound; split peas, 11  cents; navy beans, 11  cents;      pinto beans, 12  cents, spaghetti, 18  cents; rice, 16  cents.      Apples were selling for 10  cents a pound, tomatoes at 14,      flour at 8, potatoes at 3, lettuce at 10 and sweet potatoes      at 10. Milk was 17 1/2 cents a quart.    </p>    <p>      Some frugal buyers can shade even this report. There is V.      Berglin, of Tucson, Arizona, for example. For years he has      not spent more than $75 to $90 per year for his food, only      $6 to $10 per month - and he is one of the best-nourished      and peppiest individuals in the Southwest.    </p>    <p>      One month's supply for a simple liver - this is an actual      marketing list of a man who has followed this system for      living for a long time - would run like this: 20 lbs. white      flour, 10 lbs. corn meal; 6 lbs. bacon; 1 lb. salt pork; 1      lb. coffee; 1/4 lb. tea; 5 lbs. sugar; 10 lbs. potatoes; 3      lbs. macaroni; 2 lbs. raisins; 3 lbs. navy beans; 6 large      packages each of corn flakes and oat meal; 12 cans of      condensed milk. The cost will run you at today's prices      around $12. And that, plus fresh meat which you will pick      up or fish you will catch or small game you will snare or      trap, will sustain you easily and well and give you a      feeling of satisfaction and creature comfort.    </p>    <p>      One of the saddest stories from World War II told of a      British aviator whose plane was shot down over the jungle.      He parachuted to safety but soon became lost and before he      could reach friendly hands; before searching parties could      reach him; his strength was exhausted and he died of      starvation. When found, the body was lying in a bed of      purslane-a common weed found in various parts of the world.      In Europe, poor families often use purslane as a salad, and      nutritionists have found that this common weed has a food      value about equal to green string beans. The unknowing      flyer had actually starved to death in the midst of plenty.    </p>    <p>      Southern California today is one of the richest      agricultural areas in the world. Rich soil and mild climate      make for year around harvesting. But yet when the Spanish      fathers first ventured into this territory they faced      several years of precarious existence. Time after time they      were on the verge of starvation and on the point of      abandoning the enterprise. The small sailing boats took      months to make the difficult journey from Mexico against      adverse winds, tides and storms. Many of the crew died of      scurvy each trip, and the meager supplies they, could bring      were always inadequate to support the few dozen soldiers      and priests in the early California missions. By luck,      prayer and near-starvation they managed to hang on until      gardens and crops could be planted and harvested and a      livelihood assured.    </p>    <p>      But in the meantime, there were many tribes of simple      Indians whom the Franciscan monks had come to Christianize.      These peoples - and anthropologists estimate they numbered      about 100,000 had few or no clothes, only the simplest      kinds of snares and weapons, and their homes were rude      shelters of boughs, on the lee side of rocks. They needed      nothing more. They lived on seeds, small birds and animals,      the fruits and pulp of certain cactus and other desert      plants, and their principal food was a meal ground from the      abundant acorns of the live oaks and made into a porridge      or baked into cakess and bread.    </p>    <p>      The Spaniards, accustomed to a diet of cereals, meat, wine      and olives, starved rather than try the food of the      Indians. And many, many others - even today - are just such      slaves of habit and custom, ready to starve to death before      trying a new and strange food. Corn, called "maize" by many      European peoples, is considered by them to be fit only for      animal food. Relief agencies, trying to aid starving      millions, have often been in despair by the rejection of      such things as canned corn, hominy, cornmeal mush,      corn-pone or "Johnny cake," which so many of us Americans      regard as delicacies.    </p>    <p>      Habit and custom bind all of us with heavy chains, but when      combined with ignorance they form a barrier which is      well-nigh insurmountable.    </p>    <p>      Man is perhaps the most omniverous feeder of all animals.      The stomachs of cows and grass eaters are especially      adapted for their diet. Cats, dogs and similar creatures      are particularly suited for a meat diet. But nature has      apparently made the digestive apparatus of man so adaptable      that it can handle the widest variety of foods. Fanatics      have many times proved that man can live healthfully on a      raw fruit and vegetable diet; on a diet that excludes all      meats and animal products, and even on a completely liquid      diet. A famous physician who has suffered so severely with      amoebic dysentery that he was able to handle nothing but      boiled milk, still lived comfortably and well for many      years. A well-known engineer, faced with the problem of      completing his senior year of college on a very small      income, solved his problem by mixing large batches of dry      oatmeal with a little sugar and a few raisins. He had no      facilities for cooking, but ate several handfuls of this      Spartan ration daily, washed down with plenty of water. He      suffered no ill effects on this diet, maintained normal      weight and health and graduated with honors. On the other      hand, the life of the Eskimo proves that a diet of meat and      fish can be equally successful. The famous explorer,      Viljalmer Stefanson, once spent a year in the arctic during      which time his diet consisted solely of meat, yet he      returned to civilization in vigorous health and weighing      ten pounds more than when he left.    </p>    <p>      Diet in man, therefore, seems to be very largely a matter      of choice and education. Everyone who has watched a mother      wean her baby must realize this. The infant is accustomed      to a diet of milk and recognizes nothing else. When a      spoonful of porridge is given him, he promptly spits it      out. Only by the patience and persistence of the mother,      during which time the food is spilled over bib and      clothing, rubbed in the hair and played with, is he finally      taught to eat it. Each new item of diet is more or less a      repetition of the same routine. Where the mother is busy      and impatient, or where the income and available food is      limited, the diet of the child, and his food likes and      dislikes carried over into adult life, may be very limited.      Pellagra, beri-beri, scurvy and other nutritional diseases      arise not from starvation but from a restricted diet. Even      the meat-eating Stefanson found that to maintain health, he      had to eat various kinds of meat and include fat, such as      seal blubber, and the body organs - heart, liver, etc.    </p>    <p>      Modern nutritionists now agree that the preferred diet is      one that is varied as much as possible. Variety in diet      insures ample supply of vitamins, amino acids and other      trace elements which seem to be essential to health. With      such a varied diet there should be no need for supplemental      vitamin pills or potions.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps more important from the standpoint of health than      the actual diet itself, is the quantity of food taken.      Although it has been estimated that at least half the      world's population, chiefly in such densely populated      countries as China and India, do not have enough to eat, it      is equally true that a large part of the population, and      especially in the United States, suffer from evereating.      Gluttony is more common and more pernicious than      drunkeness.    </p>    <p>      Overeating is a habit more difficult to conquer than many      forms of drug addiction. A large majority of all the ills      we suffer are due directly or indirectly to overeating      Excess food acts in the human body just as excess gasoline      in an automobile engine. Valves stick, carbon accumulates,      sludge clogs up the working parts and eventually slows      down, damages and stops the motor. In a similar manner, too      much food impairs and breaks down the functioning of the      human body; fat accumulates, circulation becomes sluggish      and labored, the heart is distended, strained, and all the      organs suffer in consequence.    </p>    <p>      It is interesting to note that the first man to warn of the      harmfulness of overeating lived in Medieval Europe. Luigi      Cor naro, a Venetian, came from a wealthy family and wasted      his early years in such riotous living, drunkeness and      gluttony that by the time he was 40 degenerative diseases      had reached such a state that physicians despaired of      saving his life. Given up to die he retired to a small      country estate and took stock of himself. He was an      intelligent man; well-educated for his time, and capable of      profound reasoning. He came to the conclusion that the      human body was designed to function most efficiently and      well on the minimum amount of food that would maintain      normal weight and strength. Overeating was not simply a      waste of food but a definite strain and burden upon the      body organs. He decided to experiment upon himself and      found that - in his case - an intake of about fourteen      ounces of solid food daily, with a pint of wine best      satisfied his needs. His food was the plainest and simplest      kinds, a coarse whole grain bread, a little meat - usually      fowl - and a green salad. Caloric values were unknown five      hundred years ago and so Cornaro concerned himself only      with quantity. He found that in his own case the balance      between enough and too much was so delicate, due to damaged      organs, that the addition of only two ounces more than he      required would produce a severe digestive disturbance. This      was perhaps fortunate for it strengthened an already      formidable resolution and Cornaro was able to stick to his      diet so faithfully that he regained his health; became a      noted architect; one of the leading citizens of the      powerful Venetian republic; fathered a large family and      lived comfortably to the ripe old age of 102.    </p>    <p>      Cornaro wrote of his experiences and advised others to      follow his example, but he prescribed no diets, and      suggested that each person should experiment with the needs      of his own body to discover the kinds of food and the      minimum amount of food which would maintain health, weight      and vigor. He recognized that this would vary with the      individual and the kind of exercise and work performed.    </p>    <p>      But, although Cornaro's advice has been widely read, and      his writings translated into many languages and published      many times over, it is rare that anyone can be found with      the courage, resolution and will-power to adhere to them.      One notable exception was John D. Rockefeller, Sr., who      recovered his health and lived to the age of 96 through      careful attention to a minimum diet. In his case, as in      Cornaro's, it must be pointed out that severe digestive      troubles practically forced the limitation of diet. With      most of us, food and the pleasures of eating are so      important that we can seldom summon the will-power to      practice such Spartan restraint. It is, however, a goal to      be cherished and remembered, for the nearer we can      approximate this end, the greater will be our reward in      improved health and a comfortable long life.    </p>    <p>      Although the annual seed catalogs list a large variety of      vegetables, these are chiefly the familiar ones handed down      from generation to generation of gardeners. Often they are      not too well suited to our particular locality and often      they have been selected and inbred for so many generations      that they are now lacking in qualities which once made them      desirable. Too few realize that varieties of weeds growing      in the fields and along the roadsides may be just as      edible; indeed may even be more nutritious, more      appetizing, than our cultivated vegetables. Again, custom      and habit and the resistance to change may blind us to the      possibilities that lie around us. Just as the purslane in      which the aviator lay down to die of starvation might      easily have saved his life, so many of us waste our money      on processed and factory packaged foods while much superior      products may be trampled underfoot. Most country people      know that tender dandelion leaves, lamb's quarters, and      curly dock are superior to spinach as a cooked green, but      there are countless other edible wild plants. Hunting      edible foods in the hedgerows, fields and woods is as much      fun as hunting game and perhaps even more profitalbe since      these foods are sources of minerals, vitamins, and other      health-promoting substances which so often are deficient in      cultivated plants. If you are interested in the subject,      there is a very helpful book which will serve as a guide.      It is EDIBLE WILD PLANTS, by Oliver Perry Medsger,      published by the MacMillan Company, New York City, in 1947.      Perhaps your local library has a copy.<br />    </p>    <p>      Meat is equally available to the knowing. Rabbits,      squirrels and game birds are available in most parts of the      country in season, but few realize that other small      creatures often considered pests are just as valuable for      food . . . the grass-eating marmot or wood-chuck, the      opposum, raccoon, muskrat, yes even the skunk or porcupine.      Some years back, in an effort to encourage hunting of the      pestiferous crow, dieticians investigated the food      possibilities of this maligned bird and found it could be      prepared as tastily as chicken. And almost every small boy      who has played Indian has discovered that the sparrow and      noisy starling, plucked, cleaned and roasted on a spit over      a campfire are as delectable as quail, dove or plover. To      this list should be added fish, frogs, turtle and crayfish      available in most streams and ponds.    </p>    <p>      In this Section, too, it should be pointed out that while      the snares put out by various trappers supply houses are      most efficient, there is at present a growing interest in      the small boy's slingshot, made from a forked crotch, a      pair of rubber bands and bit of leather for a pocket.      Lopsided and misshapen stones which we used for ammunition      in childhood prevented accuracy, but modern slingshot fans      have found that lead shot, or small round pellets of clay,      dried hard in the sun, can be fired with accuracy equal to      the best bow and arrow and, indeed, comparable to a small      rifle.    </p>    <p>      The art of cooking is something that can be as elaborate as      the concoctions of a skilled French chef, or as simple as      the tin can of "Mulligan" on the hobo's fire. Taste, time,      inclination and equipment dictate how and what we may      accomplish in this line. For economy of time, effort and      money, many simple one-dish meals cooked <em>en      casserole</em> are possible. Simplest of all, of course, is      famed "mulligan stew" in which available meats from a soup      bone to a chicken are put into a kettle, or even a large      tin can, together with vegetable, salt and pepper and      cooked together to the consistency of rich soup.    </p>    <p>      The Mystery Chef, famed radio commentator on cookery, once      told of observing the unemployed during depression periods      in London survive in well-nourished comfort on a similar      dish. These poverty-stricken men, unable to find work,      would gather up the discarded outer leaves and slightly      blemished vegetables thrown out as unsalable by the      green-grocers. With a few pennies cadged at panhandling or      running small errands, they would purchase the cheapest      cuts of meat such as shin bones, neck bones, etc. Cooking      these together they would have the equivalent of a      "mulligan" stew which was not only satisfying but also      contained the elements for complete nutrition.    </p>    <p>      During the depression of 1907 a Boston newspaper reporter,      Elmer Rice, made a carefully checked demonstration of how a      working man could eat satisfactorily at a total cost of      only one dollar a week. Food costs were, of course,      considerably lower than in our day, but the chief factor in      Mr. Rice's success was the stove, an unpatented device      known as the "Atkinson stove." Since cooking costs were      included in Mr. Rice's allotment and he was restricted to a      low-cost-sleeping room of the type then used by so many      unemployed it was important that his stove be efficient,      simple and economical. The Atkinson stove was all of these.      Heat was supplied by an ordinary, inexpensive kerosene      lamp. The stove proper consisted of an insulated metal      cover which rested on a grill a few inches above the lamp,      so as not to interfere with the air supply. The slow gentle      heat accumulating under the insulated cover cooks casserole      dishes without shrinkage or burning and retains and blends      food flavors in a way that can hardly be duplicated.    </p>    <p>      The Atkinson stove can be used as readily for frying,      boiling or baking. Set on a table, the lamp could supply      evening light at the same time cooking is done. Costs are      surprisingly low, depending upon the cost of kerosene.      Doubtless the stove could be adapted very easily to use      with a charcoal pot, alcohol, gas or gasoline burner. The      essential element is the insulated metal cover, and this      can be contrived by removing the bottom, from a five-gallon      motor oil can, setting it inside a corrugated cardboard      carton with a two-inch airspace between the can and carton,      and packing this airspace with lightweight glass wool for      insulation.<br />      <strong>SECTION V<br /></strong> <strong><br />      HOW YOU CAN EARN A LIVING</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"I have never been able to find one good reason for      working at all, except for bare subsistence or for the fun      of it. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>- Charles Allen Smart</em>Of course, even a meager living requires money, and money    comes only in exchange for work of some kind, so you have to    give some thought to the problem of earning a living, if ever    so simple.		</p>    <p>      And simple it is to earn a simple living, which is all you      need.    </p>    <p>      This man, Baker, for instance, comes back into the picture      once more. As you have been told, he had less than $100,      was 64 years old, decrepit and discouraged when he set out      on his simple living jaunt. He didn't know whether he would      be able to make a go of it or not. Besides, he lived 40      miles away from the city in an isolated mountain region.      His only training was that of an office man and surveyor,      both of which aren't badly needed in the hinterlands where      he settled. So he had many hours during his first month or      two to worry about whether they'd one day find a lonely old      man starved to death in his cabin.    </p>    <p>      He laughs now at the remembrance for he is confident that      no matter where he would go he could earn all the living he      needs. He has the know-how, you see. He got it during his      first year of the simple life when he found 30 different      things to do to earn money.    </p>    <p>      What kind of things? The same kind you yourself can turn      your hand to. He had a garden, raised more than he needed,      sold his surplus - he earned $40 a year at that. He acted      as a guide for fishermen and hunters - got $5 a day for      that. He drove parties of tourists over the mountains      (mountain-scared tourists who wouldn't drive their own      cars). He experimented with different herbs, found a cough      syrup his neighbors were willing to buy. He made rustic      furniture, found it had a ready sale.    </p>    <p>      Another man, John Burnham, living in upper New York State,      went through the depression of 1929 - on without knowing      there was a depression. His recipe is one you can copy and      follows. "There never will be a time when everybody is      broke," he believes. "nor will there ever be a time when      every job that needs doing is done. There are fences to      repair, wells to dig, letters to write, advice to give.      Find out what somebody in your neighborhood wants. Then do      it for him. Do it so well and at such low cost that you      surprise him. Always give people more than they expect, and      you'll always find plenty to do."    </p>    <p>      So you will. So you will. No matter where you are, you can      turn some of your talents to money and the little money you      need will not require many of your talents nor require them      for a very long time.<br />      What will be left in the way of talents, and energy and      time will be yours to spend gloriously as you see fit, in      living this most blessed life of them all - the simple      life.<br />      <strong>SECTION VI<br /></strong> <strong><br />      HOW TO START LEADING THE SIMPLE LIFE</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"There is not a dream which may not come true, if we      have the energy which makes, or chooses, our own fate . . .      It is only the dreams of those light sleepers who dream      faintly, that do not come true. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>- A</em> <em>rthur Symons</em><br />    </p>    <p>      If you have read this far in this course you are convinced,      aren't you, that the simple life is an easy life to follow      and also the most desirable life,, and you have made up      your mind that it will be your life.    </p>    <p>      Don't wait too long to start in. Don't be like so many      persons, dreamers who go on year in and year out saying      that, Next year will be the year I will do it. But next      year never comes, and in the end it becomes too late. Be,      rather, like the Chinese gentleman who had a sign in his      garden: "ENJOY YOURSELF. IT IS LATER THAN YOU THINK," and      start as soon as you can.    </p>    <p>      There is a certain amount of mental orientation and      conditioning necessary before you set out, to be sure, and      no one but yourself can make that change - about which will      be required.    </p>    <p>      You first of all have to decide whether the simple life is      really what you are after and if you are willing to make      the changes necessary. You have to do some giving up. You      can't have the same kind of corner drugstore comforts you      have in the city. You may have to build your own fires,      wash your own clothes, read by a coal oil lamp, and eat off      an oil cloth instead of damask linen, such as you are used      to in the fine hotels.    </p>    <p>      Your social life is going to be different. You can't spend      your time at cocktail parties or chamber of commerce      banquets or watching night club acts; and if these things      are more important to you than the peace and serenity and      independence which come from the simple life, maybe you had      better not consider making the change.    </p>    <p>      But if you go into this thing with your eyes open - always      realizing in the back of your mind that in case of economic      or atomic attack it may mean the difference between      survival and destruction - you'll never find a better life      anywhere than the life that is simple.    </p>    <p>      But start preparing for it at once. Begin by buying the      outfit you need to get started - sleeping outfit, cooking      outfit, building tools, gardening tools, and the like.      There's a world of fun even in preparing for the simple      life, and mail order house and seed catalogs will enthrall      you for weeks or months before you actually are ready to      start in.    </p>    <p>      Do not delay too long. There's a new life awaiting you out      there, a fine life, a full life, and it's a shame, if you      have gone this far toward living it, for you not to go the      rest of the way - and fast!    </p>        <p>      <strong>SECTION VII</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>INFORMATION SOURCES YOU CAN DEPEND      ON</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.

This is free.    </p>    <p>      The Forest Service, also in Washington, will send you a      circular about tracts in the national forests which you can      rent.    </p>    <p>      Read the Sunday classified ads. Frequently you can pick up      small parcels of land for just a few dollars an acre.    </p>    <p>      Talk to a dependable real estate man in the vicinity of the      place you want your simple life to unfold, and ask about      renting or buying land.    </p>    <p>      CABIN BUILDING: The U.S. Government Printing Office,      Washington, will send you on request a catalog of      Government publications, several of which pertain to      building cabins and other subjects of interest to simple      livers. Many of these publications are free; others cost a      few  cents each. All are valuable to you.    </p>    <p>      Ask your local library for books on cabin building and      other phases of homesteading. There is a fairly large      literature on the subject, and a few weeks of reading will      make you expert in knowledge - only a few months actual      work will make you expert in actual construction! But get      the theory first.<br />    </p>    <p>      The publishers of POPULAR SCIENCE MAGAZINE (New York) have      several excellent manuals on home building and repairing.      They cost $1 apiece. This magazine and POPULAR MECHANICS      (Chicago) are filled each month with practical howto-do-it      articles which it would pay you to read.    </p>    <p>      CAMPING KNOWLEDGE: If you've never done much outdoor      lisving, you had better read a book or two in the subject.      Although fairly old, no other book gives you more      background knowledge than Horace Kephart's CAMPING AND      WOODCRAFT (The MacMillan Co., New York). This is a      two-volume work and is a monument to Horace Kephart, who,      incidentally, did exactly the thing you are contemplating -      left it all behind and went to live the simple life. He was      43 at the time, librarian of the Mercantile Library, and      apparently in a rut for life. But he bucked his way out,      took a few hundred dollars, and hiked to the Big Smoky      country in North Carolina. Here, living alone in a deserted      cabin, he found a wonderful life. He likewise found a      satisfying career as writer, friend of the natives,      champion of conservation, and father of the Big Smoky      National Park.    </p>    <p>      The library will get you other books on camping, but start      with Kephart's; he's one of your kind.    </p>    <p>      FISHING AND HUNTING: A large literature exists on this      subject, too, and you will find hours of interesting      reading in it. Any manual on fishing in the vicinity of      where you are to live will be invaluable; the same about a      book on hunting. One of the most thorough and workable      books on fishing is called FRESH WATER FISHING, by Arthur      H. Carhart, published by A.S. Barnes Co., New York. It      costs $5 but is well worth the price because it tells      everything.    </p>    <p>      If you plan to do some trapping write to FUR-FISH-GAME in      Columbus, Ohio, for a list of the trapping manuals      published by that firm. These are inexpensive, around $1      usually, but cover a world of practical experience.<br />      <strong>SUPPLEMENT TO SECTION IV</strong><br />      <strong>FOOD ONLY $1.00 A WEEK</strong><br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <em>"Only one thing in life matters - independence. Lose      that, lose everything. Get old like me, you'll find that      out. Keep your independence!"</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>- John Galsworthy in "Old English. "</em>    </p>    <p>      Soon after the first edition of the Course was distributed      friends began to chide us and point out that, after all, it      - was some years ago that Mr. Rice made his experiments in      living on $1 a week for food. The world has come a long way      since then (most of it for the worse, many insist) and food      costs in particular have advanced greatly. They doubted      that anyone could live on $1 a week for food today, or      anywhere near that amount. "Be reasonable," they said.      "Make it $10 a week and more folks will believe you!"    </p>    <p>      Frankly, we began to feel a little uneasy ourselves. We      don't live on $1 a week for food; never have and don't      expect to. We think it unnecessary for anyone in these      times to impose such Spartan restraints. We only intended      to point out that it could be done, and done      satisfactorily, if necessity demanded.    </p>    <p>      As doubt increased, we decided that we'd better have a      careful test made and appealed to a man who had practiced      the simple life for several years to give us the benefit of      a laboratory experiment. His report follows:    </p>    <p>      "Dear Friends: You know I'm in sympathy with your ideas,      but I didn't expect to be made a guinea pig. At least, not      in mid-July when my garden is burgeoning with the first      ripe tomatoes, green beans, sweet corn, new potatoes, peas,      et cetera, and you tell me I have to pass them all up      because some of your Doubting Thomases may not have      gardens.

Bakers use it for flavoring and      sweetening.    </p>    <p>      "Buying is important when there is need for economizing. At      the time these purchases were made the market for select      hard wheat was $2.22 per hundredweight; for soybenas, $2.43      . These are the prices the growers get for their top      quality. The feed store is entitled to a fair mark-up for      handling. But a local Health Food Store asked 350 a pound      for whole wheat in a fancy package; 25 cents a pound for      soybeans; 30 cents a pound for powdered skim milk; and      30 cents a pint for blackstrap. They have a very limited      market and must charge accordingly, but you don't have to      buy at these sources.    </p>    <p>      "Milk dryers were charging 5 cents a pound retail at their      plants. I don't know what blackstrap was selling for at the      refinery, but it is comparatively inexpensive; most of it      goes into stock feed. The very dark molasses at the grocery      is "blackstrap" - they just d on't admit it. They priced it      at 18 cents for 12 ounces.    </p>    <p>      "Of course, no one likes to sell in these little quantities      and you wouldn't want to buy in dribbles either. Wastes too      much time and temper. Better economy would be to buy fifty      or even a hundred pounds of wheat, if you can keep it in      dry, clean storage; ten or twenty-five pounds of soybeans;      a fivegallon tin of blackstrap, and ten pounds of powdered      milk, providing you can keep it in air-tight tins, or tight      glass jars. It absorbs moisture from the air and turns      rancid if exposed needlessly.<br />      MONDAY<br />    </p>    <p>      "Breakfast: I ground half a cup of wheat through my old      coffee mill, adjusting the burrs to a coarse, percolator      type grind. This I cooked with water and a pinch of salt,      and ate it sweetened with molasses and drenched with milk.      I mix the powdered milk with water, shake well, and let it      stand overnight in my spring cooler.    </p>    <p>      "After breakfast I took a couple of pounds of the wheat and      put it through my coffee mill, adjusting the burrs to the      finest, drip type grind. It put it through three or four      times until it came out like flour, but coarse, of course.    </p>    <p>      "Where did I get the coffee grinder? I bought it at the      hardware store for 50 cents. Said he'd had it on the shelf      since 1922 . You don't expect me to charge that in my week      do you? That is a capital investment.    </p>    <p>      "I measured out one and three-fourths pounds of this flour      and stirred into it one level teaspoon of salt. Then I      crumbled the cake of yeast into a cup of warm milk, stirred      it up good and added another cup of warm water. This, mixed      with the flour, made a dough of good consistency. I then      set it aside to rise for twenty minutes.    </p>    <p>      "After scrubbing my hands, I rubbed them with a bit of the      salt pork, which I also used to grease two tins. Then      kneaded my dough good, dividing it into the two tins. There      was lots of life in the yeast, so I set the dough aside to      rise again and in about half an hour it was swelling over      the top of the tins. Meanwhile, I had the stove going to      get a good hot oven. It took about an hour to bake the      bread well done, with a nice hard crust, which I like.    </p>    <p>      "I soaked a cup of soy beans in water while I made bread      and when it was done, I put the beans into a crockery pot      with a tablespoon of molasses and a couple of strips of      salt pork and cut the stove down so it would simmer cook      the beans for the evening meal. I put in plenty of water so      they didn't need watching.    </p>    <p>      "For noon lunch, I had three thick slices of my fresh bread      and a slice of salt pork. I fried out most of the grease      and dripped it onto my bread. With a glass of milk, this      was very satisfying, but I took a walk down to the back      pasture afterward and ate a few handsful of wild      raspberries, which are beginning to ripen now.    </p>    <p>      "Since you won't let me use my garden sass, I also gathered      up some still tender leaves of lamb's quarters, some tender      wood violet leaves, some watercress, and a small bunch of      sour sorrel. These would be chopped up, drenched with salt      pork drippings and made into a very tasty salad.    </p>    <p>      "Half the beans, the salad, a cup of hot mint tea, and a      slice of bread spread with molasses made the evening meal.      I suppose I should have picked a saucer of raspberries and      eaten them with milk and molasses, but I didn't think about      it, so will have them later.    </p>    <p>      "The mint grows along the run-off from the spring and I use      a lot of it, and dry the leaves for winter. I like the tea      strong and straight, but sometimes I sweeten it with a      little molasses and sometimes I put in a pinch of crushed      sorrel leaves, which gives it a little tang like      lemon.<br />      TUESDAY<br />    </p>    <p>      "Breakfast consisted of a couple of slices of bread,      toasted lightly and smeared with a little salt pork      drippings, plus a cup of coffee. To make coffee, I put a      tablespoon of the blackstrap into a cup and pour boiling      water over it. Then I stir it up good and lighten it with a      little milk. Tastes about like postum, and now that I'm      accustomed to it I prefer it to the tannic acid solution      that used to give us heartburn and indigestion in the Navy.    </p>    <p>      "For lunch, I warmed up the beans and polished them off      with a glass of milk and a slice of bread. You'd like my      bread . . . it is 100 percent whole wheat and no fooling;      heavy and dark, with a rich nutty flavor. It's the kind of      'swarzbrod' the poor peasants of Europe had to eat while      the nobility ate cake. But you'll remember that the      peasants lived long and heartily while the aristocrats lost      their teeth and their heads at an early age.    </p>    <p>      "A family of rabbits has been making free with my cabbage      since early spring and I decided this would be a good time      to reduce their numbers. I set a snare.    </p>    <p>      "For supper, I took half a cup of soy grits, which I make      by grinding them coarsely through my coffee mill, a pinch      of salt and some salt pork drippings for added flavoring,      and boiled the mixture in the simmer-cooker to make a      thick, rich soup - very like old-fashioned split pea soup.      A slice of bread, a cup of mint tea, and a dish of      raspberries and milk filled me up.    </p>    <p>      "Afterward, I cooked up a batch of whole wheat cereal with      bits of salt pork from which I had fried out most of the      grease. When it was thick and done I poured the mixture      into a pan to cool and set overnight, to make a variation      of scrapple<br />      WEDNESDAY<br />    </p>    <p>      "I was up bright and early and sure enough, there was a      cottontail about three-quarters grown in the snare. I      killed it with a quick rap on the back of the neck and cut      his head off with a heavy knife, saving all the blood I      could in a tin can. This blood, mixed with ground cereal or      soybeans makes fine catfish bait and I like to have a can      of it buried in the cool mud by the spring where it keeps      quite a long time.    </p>    <p>      "The head I carefully split in two with a long ear for a      handle on each side. Then I buried both pieces in my      compost heap for a use I will tell you about later.    </p>    <p>      "I skinned and cleaned the rabbit, cut it up and wrapped it      in a damp cloth to store in my food box in the spring. I      like to have all the animal heat well cooled before I cook      it.    </p>    <p>      "For breakfast I had a bowl of whole wheat cereal with      molasses and milk, and a cup of molasses coffee.    </p>    <p>      "For lunch, I cut some of the scrapple into half-inch      slices and fried them brown and crisp with a slice of salt      pork. A glass of milk and some wild salad greens went with      it.    </p>    <p>      "For supper, I fried the two back legs of my rabbit, ate a      bowl of wild salad greens, a slice of bread and finished      off with a cup of mint tea and a dish of raspberries and      milk.    </p>    <p>      THURSDAY<br />    </p>    <p>      "Breakfast: two slices of toast, a slice of salt pork fried      and drained, and a cup of molasses coffee.    </p>    <p>      "After breakfast, I put the remaining pieces of rabbit in a      paper sack with half a cup of whole wheat flour, and a      pinch of salt and shook them around until they were coated      well. Then I browned them good in a frying pan and put them      in my crockery casserole with half a cup of soaked      soybeans, a handful of tender lamb's quarters leaves, and      three small wild onions. These wild onions are small but      potent and have to be used with caution. I sometimes chop      the green tops in my salads - when I don't expect visitors!      I sprinkled the casserole with a little more salt and      dripped a tablespoon or two of salt pork grease over all.      Then I boiled a cup of milk with two tablespoons of whole      wheat flour until it thickened, and poured this in the pot.      I put the casserole on to cook soon after breakfast but by      lunch it still wasn't done, so I continued to simmer cook      it all afternoon.    </p>    <p>      "For lunch, I fried what was left of my scrapple and ate it      with a glass of milk which I warmed, flavored with a      spoonful of blackstrap, and drank.    </p>    <p>      "By supper time, the rabbit casserole was done just right      and I ate half of it, with a slice of bread, before my belt      began to feel tight. A cup of mint tea and a dish of      berries and milk for dessert.    </p>    <p>      FRIDAY<br />    </p>    <p>      "Breakfast: whole wheat cereal and molasses coffee.    </p>    <p>      "Lunch: two slices of bread made into a sandwich with a      filling of chopped watercress, and a glass of milk.    </p>    <p>      "After lunch I dug the pieces of rabbit head out of the      compost pile. They really weren't ripe enough, but I      figured they'd do. I tied a length of stout string to each      ear, got my minnow net and went down to a swampy,      slow-water part of the creek. Here I tossed the rabbit      heads in about three feet from the bank and left them for      half an hour. When I came back and slowly pulled them up      they were covered with crawdads (crayfish is the scientific      name). I repeated the operation until I had selected about      five dozen nice ones, each about three inches long.    </p>    <p>      "I washed them good, took them home and dropped them into      boiling salt water. They turn a bright scarlet when cooked,      look like miniature lobsters, and when the tails are      separated from the inedible bodies and shelled, they taste      very like fresh water shrimp. I ate half of them for supper      with a salad of wild greens, a slice of bread, and a cup of      tea. The rest of the crawdads I put in a covered bowl in my      spring cooled food storage box.    </p>    <p>      SATURDAY<br />    </p>    <p>      "Breakfast: two slices of toast and a cup of molasses      coffee.    </p>    <p>      "Lunch: warmed up rabbit casserole and finished it. Slice      of bread, glass of milk and dish of raspberries - plentiful      right now.    </p>    <p>      "Supper: two slices of bread soaked in milk and fried brown      on' each side in salt pork grease. Cup of mint tea.<br />      SUNDAY<br />    </p>    <p>      "Breakfast: wheat cereal with molasses and milk. Coffee.    </p>    <p>      "Dinner: I fried the rest of the crayfish with a bit of      salt pork; fixed a salad of wild greens. Two slices of      bread, a pot of tea, and raspberries.    </p>    <p>      "Supper: I eat a late noon dinner on Sundays - around two      or two-thirty - and usually skip the evening meal. However,      I was afraid you might cry 'foul' on me, so I ate some      bread and milk in the evening and called it a week.    </p>    <p>      "P.S.: Never got around to spending the last 19 cents, so I      think I'll splurge it on an ice cream soda next time I'm in      town. Folks who use the kerosene burner would probably      spend most of it on fuel. I use wood and charcoal which      costs me only sweat.    </p>    <p>      "What would I do in a big city? Well, there are woods,      fields, bunnies, and edible plants as well as fishing lakes      and streams within trolley and walking distances of most      cities. In the big cities, too, pigeons are a nuisance. But      they are fat and easily snared, and they cook up nicely if      given plenty of time on the simmer-cooker. I've lived in      New York, Los Angeles, Omaha, Denver and lots of cities in      between and I noticed most city park lily ponds are      swarming with crawdads. They are pretty well distributed      all over the country and, indeed, all over the world.    </p>    <p>      "You must keep in mind, also, that meat is not vital.      George Bernard Shaw recently celebrated his 94th birthday.      He has been a strict vegetarian for half a century and his      good health and work capacity -he has just completed a new      play - are testimony to his beliefs. Soybeans are the only      vegetable which approach the protein content of meat and      are therefore the best meat substitute. But soybeans can be      prepared in hundreds of satisfying ways.    </p>    <p>      "Soup bones, chicken feet, and government inspected horse      meat are also cheap additions to a low-cost diet available      to most city dwellers.    </p>    <p>      "If you think my week's menu was a bit monotonous, just      remember that in my garden now (July 26) I have ripe      tomatoes, sweet corn turnips, carrots, kohlrabi, kale,      cabbage, edible podded peas, lettuce, cucumbers, summer      squash, new potatoes, onions and green beans.    </p>    <p>      "What about winter? Well, I'd eat more meat; might even get      a deer. But there are also raccoons, possums, and red      squirrels in addition to rabbits. For greens, I grow      watercress in a Small aquarium and lettuce in a window boy      inside a sunny window. I also sprout soybeans. That's in      case you wouldn't let me use the stuff preserved from my      garden - which would include dried and canned vegetables      and fruits, as well as potatoes, rutabagas, squash, et      cetera in the root cellar.    </p>    <p>      "And say, I have a loaf of bread and another day or two of      food left on hand. Maybe two can live as cheaply as one!    </p>    <p>      Y ours faithfully"<br />    </p>    <p>      Competent authorities now agree that diet is the most      important single factor in the environment of all living      things. More simply stated: "You are what you eat!"    </p>    <p>      Stockmen whose livelihood depends on their skill in raising      superior beet; poultry-keepers whose success depends on the      egg laying abilities of their hens, have long known this.      It is incredible that, in the face of continuous      experimentation and demonstration of the amazing      improvements and benefits possible in animal husbandry, the      science of human nutrition has lagged so far behind.    </p>    <p>      Organic gardening - growing food plants with natural      composts and fertilizers as opposed to strong chemicals and      poisons - has proved again and again that more vigor and      greater resistance to disease and insect pests can be      developed in the plants and that their food value and      appetite appeal is greatly enhanced.    </p>    <p>      Scurvy, pellagra, beri-beri have long been recognized as      diseases caused by diet deficiencies. But how much more of      our ill health is due to faulty nutrition? A little      flourine in the drinking water may prevent tooth decay. A      little pantothenic acid in the diet may prevent gray hair.      Now scientists are discovering that certain elements in the      diet govern brain power and intelligence.    </p>    <p>      We are blind, indeed, if we cannot profit from this new      knowledge to make our own lives healthier, happier and      longer through a simple diet of easily available, natural      foods, properly prepared.    </p>    <p>      <em>"Only one thing in life matters independence.
