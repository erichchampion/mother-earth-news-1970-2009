            <p>      Discarded antlers can be valuable . . . and-if you      know where to look-they're surprisingly easy to find.    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">by Rodger L. Roose</h5>                    <p>      There's one form of hunting that'll appeal to almost      anybody who appreciates having a good excuse to roam the      outdoors on a beautiful winter's day. And-although      the sport can provide you with a collection of the giant      racks of buck deer and bull elk and moose-there are      no "seasons" or bag limits, and no licenses are required .      . . because the idea is to collect the antlers after      they've been shed. Best of all, anyone who has legal access      to woods or wilderness where the wild ruminants roam can      enjoy (and probably profit from) this activity, once he or      she has picked up some pointers on the benign form of      hunting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE ANIMAL WATCH</strong>    </p>    <p>      In my home state of Wyoming, the no-kill trophy chase      begins just before January, with preseason scouting. At      that time of year most wild game animals are fighting to      survive winter's cold, and-on calm days-the      antlered beasts usually band together in areas where a      little browse has been uncovered by earlier winds. Moose      frequently congregate in river bottoms, where they tear at      willow buds to fuel themselves, while deer are more likely      to group on the south (or warmer) sides of hills until      another storm drives them into timber to escape the      life-sapping winds.    </p>    <p>      I rarely approach any animals that I see but, instead,      watch their habits through binoculars. (When humans get too      close, the creatures will almost always run, and flight      forces them to waste precious energy.) Then I use a map to      record the spots where the deer and moose in my area seem      to hang out. I draw lines indicating heavily traveled snow      trails, too, and note timbered areas that appear to shelter      big game in harsh weather. Tracks will usually lace these      spots.    </p>    <p>      Not long after my scouting, deer and moose will begin to      shed their antlers. The base of the horn loosens from the      skull, and when the animal bumps a tree or moves its head      quickly, the antlers shear off relatively painlessly.      Larger racks seem to drop first. Probably this happens      because big bucks, bull elk, and bull moose have so much      leverage applied to their noggins by their weighty headgear      that a quick twist of the neck wrenches off loose antlers      far sooner than would be the case with spindlyhorned      specimens (young animals with little overhead mass may well      carry one or both projections far into the spring).    </p>    <p>      Once my region's moose and deer have discarded their racks,      I focus on locating the winter hangouts of elk, animals      that tend to molt later (they start to do so during the      early days of March in Wyoming). Elk habitats, during the      late winter and early spring, vary from sunny open slopes      to snowbound timber tracts to treeless mountain valleys. I      map such places and then wait until the sighting of a      number of bare-headed bulls tells me that their shedding      season is all but over.    </p>    <p>      The first part of spring, then, is prime time for elk      trophy-taking. Don't delay your hunt too long, however . .      . when summer comes, most of the past winter's antlers will      be hidden from view by sprouted greenery or ruined by      gnawing rodents.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE SHEDDING SEASONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're uncertain about just when to expect antlers to      start hitting the ground in your region, here are some      rough rules of thumb.    </p>    <p>      Game management officials in the West say that moose begin      to drop their headgear in mid-December, and that they're      usually finished by mid-January. It's a slightly different      situation in Alaska, where-as game biologist Dave      Hardy of Juneau points out-antler shedding is in full      swing from December through February. In the northeastern      states prime moose-shed time lasts from the end of December      to midFebruary.    </p>    <p>      Deer can be expected to drop their horns from late January      through February in the Southwest, while in such a typical      western state as Wyoming the season spans late December to      early February. Deer in the not-so-typical western state of      California, on the other hand, discard their antlers from      mid-November through April, with shed time varying from one      herd to another, according to the state's wildlife      biologists.    </p>    <p>      Eastern whitetail deer lose their head growths from      December through early February, while midwestern bucks      begin to shed in late January and continue into February.      Maine's regional wildlife biologist Gary Donovan tells me,      though, that the peak shed is earlier in his state . . .      running from the end of December through mid-January.      (Here's a special tip for eastern horn hunters: Deer yards,      where whitetails gather during heavy winter snows, are      excellent areas for springtime inspection, as are the      trails leading to and from the yards and any nearby bedding      and feeding locations.)    </p>    <p>      In the Southeast (Georgia, for example), buck deer begin to      go "bald" in early January. The shedding usually      <em>peaks</em> by the end of that month, but continues for      a few weeks more. Alaskan deer, although thousands of miles      to the north, are only slightly out of step with their      southern cousins: Blacktails there meet the invisible      barber from the middle of December until the end of      January.    </p>    <p>      Elk, as I've already mentioned, are slow to shed their      horns. Wyoming bulls do so from early March through the      first of May. Californians can expect their state's wapiti      to lose their racks from February through April.    </p>    <p>      No one, of course, can tell exactly when a given group of      animals will shed, because nature sets no firm timetable      for this event. An individual beast may even lose one horn,      only to carry the other for some weeks longer. That's why      preseason mapping of animal move ments is so important. The      records help the antler hunter to determine which areas      hold the greatest yield potential.    </p>    <p>      Be aware, though, that since the size and pattern of      snowfall varies from one winter to the next, antlered      critters can't be expected to occupy the same places every      year. You'll have to prepare a new map of animal haunts      annually.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ON THE HUNT</strong>    </p>    <p>      When I set out on my collecting forays, I carry a backpack      frame on which to lash my trophies. I used to take the      frame with the pack in place, but I've found that it's      easier to tie antlers on when the bulky sack isn't there to      get in the way. My water, rope, food, compass, and      emergency survival gear are hauled in a small daypack,      which I attach to the frame's upper portion. (By undoing my      daypack's straps and looping them under the frame's top      crossbars, I can be certain that these provisions ride      comfortably.) Binoculars-which every outdoorsperson should      own-and a camera are added to my gear. I then stuff      one red bandanna in a pocket, and I'm ready to set out into      the habitat that my benefactors are vacating.    </p>    <p>      Actually, I always delay my departure until the snow has      melted enough to insure that any animal I do encounter      won't be overtaxed if it runs from me. I prefer      <em>not</em> to wait for total thaw, however . . . because      horns are easily seen on snow, whereas they blend      incredibly well with the bare earth and are thus tougher to      spot in the warmer weather.    </p>    <p>      In any case, the "harvest" requires one heck of a lot of      cross-country clambering, and lightweight      binoculars-in the 7- to 10-power class-can save      both energy and time: They'll help you confirm whether or      not a "something" that appears to be an antler actually is      . . . without your having to check out each possible find      close up.    </p>    <p>      Careful scrutiny is necessary, because deer horns      frequently resemble downed branches or exposed tree roots.      Examine each object for the details that identify antlers.      For example, are its tips pointed and lighter in color than      the main beam? Does its surface seem smooth, or is it      apparently bark-covered? Do small twigs branch off at the      "expected" angles? And, finally, is it <em>shaped</em> like      an antler? If you're still uncertain, try walking just far      enough to get another perspective before actually heading      for the spot. By following this routine, you should be able      to shave the number of false alarms-and nonproductive      side trips-to a minimum.    </p>    <p>      Moose wintering grounds-which are typically at      relatively low elevations-are normally the first to      be relieved of heavy snow, so during my explorations I      thoroughly crisscross every area where I've formerly      spotted bulls. Willow thickets, whose young shoots often      keep the massive animals from starvation, are choice cover      to search . . . but don't neglect boggy stream edges, which      the moose like to travel, or thick lowland brush and timber      in which they ride out storms.    </p>    <p>      Stay alert and try to look literally everywhere. I once      found a fine antler on the bottom of a clear beaver pond      while looking for trout. No doubt aquatic plants had lured      the moose to feed there at the time when, as it happened,      its horns were being discarded. I fished the unexpected      bonus out by means of a shoestring noose tied to a willow      branch.    </p>    <p>      Don't, however, feel that you have to carry home every horn      you find. Sunbleached antlers are good for mementos, but      they hold little real value. Freshly shed, brown-colored      beams are the prizes to seek . . . and, of course, are also      the hardest to spot.    </p>    <p>      When you do come upon the souvenirs you're after, remember      that you could hurt yourself should you trip and fall on      their pointed tips . . . so always hold antlers with the      points down. It's also important, when hiking on slopes, to      carry racks in the hand that's on the downhill side, since      a person who's traversing steep terrain generally tries to      fall uphill. I usually tie my horns to my backpack frame,      but still I make sure they're pointed away from my neck and      back.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE PAYOFF</strong>    </p>    <p>      Antler hunting can provide you with great outdoor exercise      and the thrill of finding what you're seeking. However, the      additional benefits of the sport are probably greater than      you'd imagine.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, by making a field survey of buck whitetail      or bull moose antlers, the game hunter will be able to      determine the animals' population density for a given area      (these beasts seldom migrate to distant ranges, as do mule      deer and elk). Since the dropped horns belonged to game      that's still alive, that information should help the      stalker decide whether or not the region contains enough      animals to support a hunt during the next archery or gun      season.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you might simply want to pick up some of these      wilderness prizes for household display (the occasional      "freak" horns you'll find are excellent conversation      pieces). Or perhaps you'll use them in craft projects: I've      seen antler-tip jewelry . . . a huge antler picture frame .      . . horn belt buckles . . . and a variety of other items      that incorporate the free-for-the-gathering raw material.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: In the next issue of MOTHER, the author      will show you how to make a number of different-and      salable-craft products from antlers.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Then again, many people search out discarded racks because      of their market value. Where I live, most horns with      brownish color can be sold for about $6.00 a pound, and the      price is still rising. Some Oriental purchasers grind      quality beams into a powder, which is sold as an      aphrodisiac. Jewelry firms and novelty or tourist shops      help keep the demand up by making curios from antlers.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, then, there's cash to be made . . . but the      truth is, I hope the prices don't go any higher. As one      businessman put it, "Pretty soon the rewards will be so      great that poachers will start taking animals out of season      just for their heads" (much as tusk hunters have helped      bring elephants close to extinction).    </p>    <p>      Scavengers who search out already shed antlers, on the      other hand, are providing the market with a quickly renewed      resource.    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind, however, that national parks don't allow      visitors to remove antlers, and neither do some wildlife      preserves . . . illegal collection in such areas could put      you in the slammer. And state laws vary: California, for      example, allows residents to <em>possess</em> tule elk      antlers but not to <em>sell</em> them.    </p>    <p>      The inconsistency of the rules points out the need for      prospective horn hunters to contact game officials      regarding local regulations before setting out after any      trophies.    </p>    <p>      Interestingly enough, though, one of the largest legal      antler roundups does take place on a preserve . . . the      National Elk Refuge not far from Jackson, Wyoming. The      catch is that only local Boy Scouts are issued the permit      that allows them and their supervisors to comb the area,      after the 7,000 to 10,000 elk that winter there have cast      off their horns and left. One record season saw the Scouts      gather a whopping 8,793 pounds of antlers in less than a      full day.    </p>    <p>      I had the opportunity to go along and photograph that event      one year, and I was stunned at the booty collected. The      take would have covered a basketball court to a depth of 15      inches!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE HORNS OF PLENTY</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you've done your scouting and mapping well, you may find      yourself confronted by a really rather <em>pleasant</em>      problem . . . that is, you could well collect so many      antlers that you can't carry your entire haul home in one      trip. In such a case, simply stash the surplus treasures in      a place where few people will travel, and come back for      them later.    </p>    <p>      In my somewhat remote area, I'm not much concerned that      someone will stumble across my cache of hard-earned      hatracks, but I do dread the possibility that I'll forget      where I put them! My "security" is provided by the red      bandanna I mentioned earlier. I just knot the kerchief      around a low bush to flag me down on the return trip.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you won't always be blessed with such bounty.      There are times when even the most conscientious searcher      will come back empty-handed. For that reason I seldom go      afield only to find antlers. To do so would invite      letdowns, so I include a camera and telephoto lens among my      gear. I snap away at whatever wildlife I see during horn      hunts . . . photographing everything from sassy red      squirrels and blue grouse to coyotes and elk calves (which      I don't approach). Thus I seldom end a trip without rewards      of one kind or another.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, every time I advance to claim a fresh rack,      all the work and previous disappointments seem worthwhile.      Fingering the story of rut fights and winter hardships      that's etched on every antler allows me to appreciate more      fully the lives of the wild creatures that produced these      trophies . . . which just lie there, free for the taking.    </p>
