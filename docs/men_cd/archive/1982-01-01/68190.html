            <p>      Suffering from the "post-holiday heavies?" Try this ancient      form of exercise.    </p>            <p>      Not many exercise regimens can boast of having no special      requirements for space or equipment . . . a rich spiritual      background . . . and techniques that can be mastered by      anyone between the ages of 5 and 95 . . . while virtually      guaranteeing their followers increased agility and energy,      plus trimmer bodies and clearer minds. Yoga, however, can      make such claims, because it's no ordinary training      program: It's an integral part of a centuries-old Hindu      philosophy that concentrates on helping the practitioner to      realize his or her true nature, and-as a result of      that achievement-to feel a sense of closeness with      what the Eastern tradition calls the Universal Spirit.    </p>    <p>      Yoga-which was first described in 2,000 B.C., in the      <em>Sutras</em> of the Indian scholar Patanjali-takes      its name from a Sanskrit word meaning bond, attachment, or      union . . . and is divided into several branches, which      include the yoga of action, the yoga of mental mastery, the      yoga of knowledge, and the yoga of devotion. These and      other practices are traditionally considered landmarks      along the path to liberation of the self . . . a journey      that takes as its starting point <em>hatha yoga</em> (the      yoga of physical force).    </p>    <p>      Masters of yogic philosophy believe that, in order to      purify their minds (and thus enable themselves to      experience a state of cosmic consciousness), they must      first gain control over their physical bodies through a      series of cleansings, breath control exercises, and the      peculiar positions-or <em>asanas</em> -of hatha      yoga. Over the past few years, a growing number of      Westerners have become familiar with that physical aspect      of the regimen, and hatha yoga is now commonly taught in      recreation centers, theaters, schools, retirement homes,      prisons, and athletic clubs across North America.    </p>    <p>      The term <em>hatha</em> is derived from the Sanskrit "ha"      (sun) and "tha" (moon), and symbolizes the duality of body      and mind (the twin complementary parts of the whole self,      which form a complete being when brought together).      Although it's basically a preparatory discipline, to be      mastered prior to tackling the more meditative branches of      yoga, hatha can be studied by individuals who have no      intention of pursuing the more advanced yogic techniques .      . . and many Westerners have found that surprising      results-both physical <em>and mental-</em> can      be achieved by conscientious practice of the asanas.    </p>    <h3>      GREAT EXPECTATIONS    </h3>    <p>      While yoga can't provide the heart-pumping workout possible      with aerobic exercise, it does offer quite a few long-range      benefits for both the body and the mind. The slow, measured      movements of the asanas develop balance, agility, and      flexibility as they massage the body's muscles and joints      through repeated sequences of contraction and relaxation.      Furthermore, the physical benefits are usually reflected in      an improved mental equilibrium . . . that is, the student      experiences the tranquillity of a quiet, free -flowing      state of mind. Finally, the novice yogi or yogini-by      learning to sustain each posture for several      seconds-often develops a fine-tuned power of concen      tration that can be an aid in his or her daily work.    </p>    <p>      Through its wide range of postures, hatha yoga aims to tone      the whole body . . . and while the practice doesn't always      result in weight loss, it does-when kept      up-help the body to redistribute weight in ways that      fit a person's bone structure. Most asanas-especially      those that involve upside-down positions-are also      said to help regulate the metabolism by putting beneficial      pressure on the glands and stimulating their action with a      gentle "inner massage".    </p>    <p>      The physical branch of yoga helps to break down the painful      connective tissue that can grow in joints, too . . . so it      can ease the aches and pains of such chronic ailments as      rheumatism, arthritis, and bursitis. Yoga is often said to      alleviate migraine headaches, as well as constipation and      other digestive problems . . . and it can sometimes      effectively lower blood pressure by improving circulation.      What's more, many of the basic hatha yoga exercises involve      breath control, thereby increasing the amount of      life-giving oxygen absorbed by the blood.    </p>    <p>      Hatha yoga, then, is a wonderful form of exercise! In fact,      after just a few days of experimenting with the beginning      postures, you can expect to experience increased energy, a      heightened sense of awareness, and the first indications of      a firmer, better-toned physique. Not long thereafter, as      your complexion starts to glow and your hair takes on a new      sheen, you should also be able to <em>see</em> the      difference yoga can make.    </p>        <h3>      HOW TO "POSTURE"    </h3>    <p>      The word <em>asana</em> comes from the Sanskrit term for      "seat" or "sitting method", and it's generally believed      that the intricate set of hatha poses now familiar to yoga      students evolved from a few simple meditation positions.      Each hatha asana is referred to by a      tongue-twisting-for Westerners-Sanskrit term      (which usually ends in "-asana"), but many have also been      given more easily remembered names . . . of animals,      vegetation, farm implements, and various Hindu deities.    </p>    <p>      There are only a few basic guidelines to be observed while      practicing yoga. First, posturing should always be done on      an empty stomach, so wait at least three hours after eating      a full meal-or one hour after a snack-before      beginning your asanas. Many think that the exercises are      best performed immediately after waking each day. However,      you'll probably find that your body is less flexible in the      early morning, so you may prefer to do some of the more      difficult postures later . . . perhaps as a means of      bedtime relaxation.    </p>    <p>      Practice your yoga in a quiet, airy room that's warm enough      to keep your muscles "primed". (What could be more pleasant      on chilly winter evenings than a few minutes of yoga in      front of the fireplace or woodstove?) Be sure you're      working on a level surface, and use a towel or blanket to      pad the floor underneath you.    </p>    <p>      Start with the easier asanas-such as the ones shown      in the accompanying photos-and then progress as your      body becomes more flexible. You <em>can</em> learn a few      hatha asanas from the pictures and detailed descriptions      given here, but there's really no substitute for a      competent teacher who can see (and correct) your mistakes      as you develop. To find a class in your area, check with      the community recreation department or the YMCA/YWCA.      Or-if you live in an urban area-inquire at a      local dance school . . . the institution may well have a      staff member qualified to teach yoga.    </p>    <p>      The most important thing to remember when practicing your      postures is to MOVE SLOWLY! The benefits of yoga are gained      only through gradual, con <em>trolled</em> movements, which      should be performed with a fluid grace that feels-and      looks-beautiful. Assume each asana slowly, hold      it-keeping as still as possible-and then ease      back to the starting point. (In most poses, try to maintain      position for 15 to 30 seconds . . . but <em>never</em> hold      any asana beyond the point where the stretching becomes any      more painful than "normal" exercise.) You need to adopt      each posture only once (or twice at most) in the sequence,      and-through it all-breathe slowly and deeply,      without forcing your respiration to keep time with the      exertions of the exercise.    </p>        <h3>      INTRODUCTORY ASANAS    </h3>    <p>      Here, then, are descriptions of a few postures . . . just      enough to initiate you into the technique of hatha yoga.      These positions represent the basic moves that, together,      form a foundation for the more difficult asanas practiced      by master yogis . . . and they're familiar parts of most      beginning yoga classes. (Although the poses pictured here      are all on-the-floor exercises, there's also an entire      system of <em>standing</em> postures which can be learned      by the novice.)    </p>    <p>      The FOLDED LEAF-a composite of several classic      embryonic/fetal postures-is a good opening position      for your hatha session, since it relaxes <em>and</em>      stimulates the whole body. Sit on your calves-with      your feet turned under and your toes pointing      back-and then drop your torso forward till it rests      on your knees. Now, place your arms loosely beside your      legs (with the palms facing upward) and bend your neck      until the crown of your head touches the floor in front of      your knees. Rest in this position for about 30 seconds,      while breathing slowly and allowing your mind to turn away      from any distracting thoughts.    </p>    <p>      Next, move into the FORWARD SITTING STRETCH (called      <em>Paschimottanasana),</em> starting from a seated      position with your legs extended directly in front of you.      Keeping your back as straight as possible, lean      forward-sliding your palms down your legs-and      try to catch your toes . . . or the soles of your feet, if      you're already fairly flexible. At the same time, rest your      face on your knees and breathe normally (this may be the      most difficult part of the exercise!). The      <em>Paschimottanasana</em> tones the abdominal organs,      stretches the spine, and massages the heart muscle. It also      sends an increased blood flow to the pelvic region, so it's      often recommended as a self-help treatment for sexual      misfunctions.    </p>    <p>      The CAMEL <em>(Ustrasana)</em> is helpful in correcting      stiff or rounded shoulders, and it can also develop leg      muscles and expand the chest and diaphragm. To go into the      pose, kneel on the floor with your knees and ankles      together and your palms on your hips. Then, bending from      the knees, curve your spine backward and grasp your heels      with your hands. Contract your buttocks, arch your back as      far as possible, and allow your head to fall back. Remain      in the Camel position for up to half a minute, breathing      freely.    </p>    <p>      The beginning series of asanas continues with the SHOULDER      STAND, or <em>Sarvangasana</em> . Begin by lying flat on      your back, then bend your legs and bring the knees up to      your chest. Move the trunk of your body into a vertical      position and support it by placing your hands against the      small of your back. Then, without losing balance, slowly      raise your legs straight up so that your body forms a      vertical line from shoulders to toes. Now, move your chest      toward your chin and center the weight of your body on your      shoulders and neck. Breathe freely and remain in this      posture for at least 20 seconds . . . during which time      you'll enjoy the benefits of added blood flow to the brain,      scalp, and facial tissues.    </p>    <p>      The Shoulder Stand also strengthens the spine and relieves      congestion in the legs, pelvis, and abdomen (making this      asana a potential boon for sufferers of varicose veins,      menstrual disorders, and digestive ailments). For obvious      reasons, however, the <em>Sarvangasana</em> -as well      as all other inverted postures-should not be      practiced by anyone with high blood pressure, spinal      malformations, angina, sinusitis, or severe head or neck      difficulties.    </p>    <p>      A natural successor to the Shoulder Stand is the PLOUGH, or      <em>Halasana</em> . Lower your legs, from the vertical      posture, over your face . . . so that your toes touch the      floor in back of your head (you'll end up looking at your      thighs). You can either leave your hands in the      back-supporting position, or-after you have practiced      the asana a number of times-stretch them out on the      floor and touch your toes, as demonstrated in the photo.      The Plough offers the same physical benefits as does the      Shoulder Stand . . . and it can reportedly relieve      headaches, tired eyes, and sore necks.    </p>    <p>      The COBRA <em>(Bhujangasana)</em> is an excellent toner for      the whole body, and is especially good for the abdomen,      buttocks, and chest. Its great value is in the way it      stretches and exercises the entire length of the spine,      from the lumbar region up to the neck. This pose can also      sometimes relieve constipation, and is said to increase      blood flow to the reproductive organs.    </p>    <p>      Lie down on your stomach with your elbows bent and hands      placed flat on the floor a few inches in front of your      shoulders. Slowly raise your head, your neck, and then your      spine-vertebra by vertebra-until you've reared      up in the "strike" position of an attacking cobra. Let your      upper back do most of the lifting work. Continue to rise      until your arms are straight (or as nearly so as possible)      . . . keeping your body, from the navel down, flat on the      floor. Hold the final position for 10 to 20 seconds, then      slowly lower your torso.    </p>    <p>      The LOCUST <em>(Salabhasana)</em> is an appropriate      follow-up to the Cobra, since it exerts a different kind of      pressure on the spine. In addition to strengthening the      lower back, this posture brings blood to the neck and      brain, and enhances the tone of the pelvic muscles. Again,      begin by lying face down on the floor . . . but this time,      press your arms-with each hand clenched in a      fist-under your hipbones. Next, slowly raise your      legs as high as possible while balancing on your arms,      chest, shoulders, and chin. Stay in the pose for 10 to 15      seconds, then gently lower your legs to the ground.    </p>    <p>      The BOW <em>(Dhanurasana)</em> combines the beneficial      effects of the Locust and the Cobra, and it's said to be an      especially healthful pose for women. Lie on your stomach,      bend your knees, then reach back and grab your ankles in an      effort to lift your thighs and chest off the floor.      Initially, you probably won't be able to manage the feat .      . . but it'll be easier to pull the "bow" taut if you      spread your legs wide apart at first.    </p>    <p>      After your muscles have strengthened, you'll be able to      keep your legs together as you lift off the ground and      balance only on your stomach. Hold the drawn-bow pose for      at least six seconds (once you achieve a good balance, you      can even rock back and forth slightly in this asana), then      release your ankles and move back into the starting      position. The <em>Dhanurasana</em> promotes freer      circulation in the whole body, and you should feel a      healthy glow as you come out of it. Abdominal and stomach      muscles are massaged, too, and the Bow tends to      stretch-and firm-the legs, chest, throat, and      jawline. It's also wonderful for loosening and limbering      the spine, the hips, and the shoulders.    </p>    <p>      You can finish up your hatha session with a few minutes of      relaxation in the appropriately named CORPSE pose      <em>(Savasana).</em> Lie on your back with your legs and      arms outstretched, close your eyes, and relax your body as      completely as you can. Keep your arms slightly away from      your body and your legs apart, and don't try to point your      toes or straighten your fingers, since doing so could      create unnecessary tension. Concentrate on your breathing      for a minute or two-or until it becomes quiet and      even-then allow your attention to travel through your      body in a conscious effort to relax each part. Begin at the      feet and move upward through your legs, torso, arms,      shoulders, and head . . . instructing each muscle to "let      go" and allowing the tension to drain out of it.    </p>    <p>      If your attention wanders, patiently guide it <em>back</em>      to your body and continue the relaxation sequence. This      posture-when you indulge in it for 15 minutes or      so-can help eliminate fatigue and soothe the nerves,      leaving you refreshed, recharged ... and looking forward to      your <em>next</em> session of hatha yoga!    </p>        <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: A number of excellent books are available to      students of yoga.
