                    <p>      Additional tips for those who were inspired by the article      in MOTHER NO. 72:    </p>        <p>      Anyone who's read Carl Heilman's article in the last issue      of MOTHER ("Make Your Own Snowshoes", page 138) already has      a good grounding in the art of fashioning the      practical-and fun-to-use-winter footwear.      However, after going over the finished piece, Carl has      kindly provided us with some additional information (and a      few points of clarification) that should help anyone who's      tackling the project.</p><p> First of all, Carl points out, it's      possible to split two bows from each quarter-log if you lay      them out as in the accompanying illustration. After a bow      is split off (either by using a circular saw to rip the      length of the log at a point 1 inch from the hand-split      edge, or by gradually tapping an axe along a line parallel      to the hand-split edge), excess wood can be removed from      the heartwood side with a power saw . . . to produce the      roughly 1 " X 1-1/8" X 8' bow, which is then shaved into      shape. (If you don't have access to a shaving bench, the      bow can be clamped to a solid surface while you work it      with a drawknife.)</p><p> Carl also cautions snowshoe builders who      choose copper nails to connect the two halves of a shoe's      tail not to <em>drive</em> the fasteners through the wood.      Instead, drill the bow first, then cut the nail to a bit      longer than the width of the tail and washer, slip it      through, and gradually peen the end of the nail over the      washer with many light taps from a ball-peen hammer. (By      the way, the tail of the snowshoe aids in "tracking" . . .      that is, it helps keep the shoes pointed straight ahead as      you walk through the woods.)</p><p> When choosing your lacing      material-either rawhide or neoprene-keep in      mind, Carl tells us, that the former <em>will</em> prove      best for dry snow, while the latter is a better "all      condition" lacing. (Rawhide <em>will</em> become stretchy      and soak up water in wet weather, but not so badly that it      can't be used under such conditions.) And when lacing      rawhide, do stretch the material, but use common sense and      don't apply <em>too</em> much force. (Incidentally, those      of you who decide to fashion your own bindings rather than      purchase them ready-made can take a few tips from the      traditional native American bindings pictured here.)</p><p> As you      walk in your snowshoes (you'll probably want to wear them      with high-top moccasins and wool socks in dry snow . . .      felt pack or good leather hiking boots will serve under      most conditions), be careful not to allow one shoe to step      on the other, <em>and</em> remember never to let a snowshoe      "bridge" between two high points.</p><p> That's about that. MOTHER      would like to thank Carl for taking the time to provide      this additional information . . . and to wish you      <em>all</em> many happy trails through the winter woods.    </p>
