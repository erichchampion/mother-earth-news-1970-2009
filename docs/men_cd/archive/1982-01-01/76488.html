    <p>
                <p>      As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it      comes to getting back to the land and living a life of      voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they      originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green      Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.    </p>    <p>      Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast of Maine and start all over again.    </p>    <p>      And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses) and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.    </p>    <p>      Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we all can read what      the Nearings have to say.    </p>        <p>      <em>I'm interested in vegetarianism, and would like to ask      you a few questions about your daily diet. First, how many      calories and grams of protein do you each consume to meet      your nutritional needs, and do you advise taking vitamin      supplements? Second, I feel that a great deal of excess      time, effort, and energy is spent in food preparation in      most homes. Would you recommend that human beings eat as      much of their food as possible in its natural</em>      <em>uncooked state, or do you feel that there are some      actual benefits derived from cooking certain foods? And,      finally, are there any common garden vegetables that you      believe shouldn't be eaten raw?</em>    </p>    <p>      We do not count calories or grams of protein, but we feel      that-in general-the American public is      overproteinized and too calorie conscious. By simply eating      (and not overeating) fresh, unprocessed vegetables combined      with whole grains and nuts, an individual ought to be able      to obtain all the nutrients he or she needs without taking      vitamin supplements.    </p>    <p>      Your second query, which concerned simplicity in food      preparation, is dealt with in Helen's latest book,      <em>Simple</em> <em>Food for the Good Life</em> (available      for $12.95-plus 95 cents shipping and      handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791). The chapters are      devoted to such topics as "To Cook or Not to Cook: Raw      Versus Cooked Food", "The Work of Cooking: Need It Be      Drudgery?", and "To Kill or Not to Kill: Flesh Foods Versus      Plants".    </p>    <p>      And as to garden vegetables that shouldn't be eaten raw . .      . there aren't any that we know of. As noted in Helen's      cookbook, "There is no substitute for the raw natural food      of nature. Boiling, baking, frying, cooking, freezing,      drying, salting away, storing, and generally preserving      food are poor substitutes for eating things fresh and raw."      [EDITOR'S NOTE: Some parts of plants which might be      included in your garden crop-such as the leaves of      rhubarb and potatoes-are, of course, poisonous . . .      whether eaten raw or cooked.]    </p>    <p>      <em>You stated, in MOTHER NO. 63, that the problems of a      day-to-day rural existence make homesteading difficult      for</em> <em>a single person to tackle . . . so I'd like to      find out your opinions about cooperating on a community      level. Do you believe in the age-old practice of working      with your neighbors on, for example, building or plowing      chores . . . or do you feel that a back-to-the-land couple      should try to do it all on their own? Do you now pool your      energy-or have you done so in the past-with      your neighbors to complete labor-intensive projects? I'd      like to know, too, whether you belong to a food co-op where      you can obtain staple products at a reduced cost.</em>    </p>    <p>      We definitely believe in cooperating on a community level      and have always tried to offer an extra hand to our      neighbors when they've needed it. In our home in      Vermont-for instance-we helped with sugaring,      wood chopping and sawing, building, and gardening . . .      and, in return, we were aided in our larger projects.      Homesteaders can, and should, contribute their energies to      help their neighbors.    </p>    <p>      Yes, we do belong to a local food co-op where we buy our      staple items. (Of course, such cooperative buying programs      weren't much in evidence when we started our move back to      the land almost half a century ago.)    </p>    <p>      <em>My husband and I-both in our late      fifties-have purchased a home in the Adirondack      Mountains of upstate New York, where we intend to spend our      retirement years homesteading. Of course, as part of our      move back to a simple lifestyle, we plan to recycle all of      our organic kitchen waste for use in the garden. You      mentioned (in MOTHER NO. 71) that you compost your      household garbage in outdoor piles. However, we wondered if      you use any other sort of recycling system in the winter,      when cold temperatures slow down the decomposing action in      outdoor compost heaps. I seem to recall that composting can      be done in large plastic waste cans that are stored in the      cellar (or a similar frostproof area). Do you use this      method in the cold months . . . or can you suggest an      alternative?</em>    </p>    <p>      We usually build and add to our compost piles during the      months when the land is not in "deep freeze". Then, over      the course of the winter, we simply carry our garbage out      to an in-the-works compost heap and leave it as is until      the weather becomes milder. We also have a Clivus Multrum      (sometimes called a Swedish "earth closet") composting      toilet into which we can throw some of our household      wastes, thus saving us from an occasional nipping walk      through the snow during a winter storm. We've never stored      our compost for any length of time in cans in the cellar.    </p>    <p>      <em>I realize that the everyday tasks of maintaining a      homestead must keep you both in good physical shape, but do      you participate in any structured form of exercise (yoga or      the martial arts, for instance) to "fine-tune" your      bodies?</em>    </p>    <p>      No, we find that our day-to-day chores on the farm provide      us with all the workout our bodies need . . . and we do no      formal exercises.    </p>    <p>      <em>I read your column with interest, and I'm indebted to      you both for so generously sharing the knowledge you've      gained over the years. MOTHER NO. 71 mentioned that the      interior walls of your home are paneled with pine that has      been stained permanently. What kind of finish did you use      on the wood to pre. serve its natural beauty and at the      same time protect it? Also, how do you care for your wooden      eating utensils . . . do you use any oil or finish on      them?</em>    </p>    <p>      We decided on a semitransparent oil-based stain (which is      sold in various shades from golden yellow to tan) to finish      and preserve our paneling. The lighter shades are      best-we think-since the wood itself tends to      darken naturally as it ages. (We know of folks who stained      with a rich shade of brown, but-within a      year-their wood became too dark to be attractive.)    </p>    <p>      We always wash our wooden bowls and      spoons-immediately after using them-in warm,      lukewarm, or cold running water and then stack the utensils      to dry. We use no soap on the wooden implements. Our system      must work, because we're still eating from wooden bowls      that we purchased over 40 years ago! The only special care      we give them is to coat the wood with olive, soy, or peanut      oil when it begins to look dry and thirsty.    </p>
