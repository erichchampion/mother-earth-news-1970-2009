            <p>      Issue # 73- January/February 1982    </p>    <p>      There's a way to deter livestock predators that's as old as      the sheep-grazing hills of Europe.    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTOS    </p>        <p>      Anatolian Shepherds are<br />      courageous and were once used as<br />      war dogs.    </p>    <p>      The Maremma, a bit smaller and<br />      friendlier than the other<br />      guardians, is well suited to small farms    </p>    <p>      The Tibetan Mastiff is one of the<br />      world's oldest breeds.    </p>        <p>      This Komondor pup's distinctive<br />      coat is not yet fully developed.    </p>    <p>      The Shar Planinetz is from<br />      Yugoslavia.    </p>    <p>      The Hungarian Kuvasz enjoys<br />      watching his charges from higher<br />      elevations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ed Andrews and Randy Kidd</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>In issue 69, MOTHER featured an article on the      Komondor, a rare breed of dog that has long been used, in      Hungary, for livestock protection. Well, we've since been      made aware of many other European and Asian breeds that      have evolved, often over hundreds of generations, to become      effective canine shepherds. What's more, such dogs can be      trained to guard almost anything, so even folks who don't      raise sheep may be interested in learning more about this      fine, natural method of predator control.</em>    </p>    <p>      Predatory animals are a source of continual frustration to      most homesteaders who raise livestock. A quietly foraging      flock of sheep or hens will too often provide an easy meal      to such animals as coyotes and foxes. Worse yet, wild dog      packs -which often include tame canines that are allowed to      run, and which have been known to attack people-have become      almost commonplace in many areas.    </p>    <p>      However, farmers frequently have little choice but to write      off herd or flock losses rather than try to cope with the      various marauders, because they've found that attempting to      control the varmints by shooting or trapping them is time      consuming ... while poisons often endanger innocent species      ... and physical barriers are just too costly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT CAN BE DONE?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, there is (once again!) an old-time natural      remedy that can be effective in solving the dilemma.      Livestock raisers in Europe and Asia have, for thousands of      years, employed various breeds of dogs to deter both      two-and four-legged predators. Several of these canine      varieties have come down through the centuries unspoiled by      irresponsible breeders or dog show fanciers (who have bred      defects into many types). The guard dogs are often referred      to as "shepherds", but they don't actually <em>herd</em>      livestock in the manner of Border collies or Belgian      sheepdogs. Instead, these animals have more "maternal" and      protective instincts, and will allow their charges to      wander freely ... as long as they remain in sight and out      of trouble.    </p>    <p>      In fact, protection dogs are actually <em>followers</em>      ... they meander behind their flocks quietly, almost      lethargically. If you were to spend a long period of time      observing an assembly of livestock with a good guard dog in      its midst, you'd probably be amazed at the total      <em>lack</em> of action in the field. No stock disappear,      no predators set foot inside the pasture, and no strangers      are allowed entrance in the dog's territory.    </p>    <p>      Evidently the mere presence of such a canine is enough to      discourage most predators. If a coyote, another dog, or an      unknown human should intrude upon the scene, though, the      attitude of the dog will change drastically. It will first      sound a barking challenge ... and if that doesn't repel the      intruder, the canine will "rush" the stranger with tail      upraised. The dog will always carefully position itself      between its charges and the trespasser, and - if      necessary - can become quite aggressive. However,      once a predator has been driven off the premises, the dog      generally returns to the flock ... knowing full well that      its place is alongside the grassgrazers, <em>not</em> out      chasing after a fight.    </p>    <p>      Obviously, you won't be finding many of these very      specialized animals at your neighborhood pet shop. In fact,      only a few are readily available in the United States ...      mostly through special breeders and associations. Here are      brief descriptions - and sources for further      information - of some of the working dogs being bred      in the U.S. today.    </p>    <p>      THE GREAT PYRENEES. This dog is named for its original work      place, the Pyrenees Mountains bordering France and Spain. A      large white animal with a face resembling that of a bear,      the "Pyr" will mature fairly early and can often assume its      duties at six months of age. These are versatile dogs . . .      besides being formidable livestock guards, they'll      typically enjoy pulling carts or sleds, and can even      perform remarkably well as babysitters! The male stands 27      to 32 inches tall and weighs 100 to 125 pounds (females are      somewhat smaller). Their coats are heavy, and the animals      are well suited to regions that experience cold weather.      For more information, write to the Great Pyrenees Club of      America, c/o Coombs, Dept. TMEN, 3119 Valley Road, West      Millington, New Jersey 07946.    </p>    <p>      THE SHAR PLANINETZ. This Yugoslavian native looks much like      the Great Pyrenees but is slightly smaller, measuring 22 to      24 inches at the shoulder. Most "Shars" have buff or light      gray coats, but the color can range from black to white      (the animals' faces and muzzles are usually darkest). These      dogs are friendly and demonstrative as pups but will become      aloof and distant as they mature. You can contact the      Yugoslavian Shepherd Shar Planinetz Club, c/o Mrvichin,      Dept. TMEN, 18335 Aquiro, Rowland Heights, California      91748.    </p>    <p>      THE MAREMMA. A dog that has worked for centuries in the      plains of Tuscany and in the Abruzzi mountains of central      Italy, the Maremma resembles the two previously described      breeds (in fact, all three probably share a common Asian      ancestry). A typical male stands 26 to 29 inches at the      shoulder and weighs in at about 80 pounds. Its coat is      thick and white, and will occasionally sport dark spots.      The Maremma seems to be friendlier than most other      protection breeds, and thus might be better suited for      small farms where considerable human contact is likely.      Write for information to the Maremma Sheepdog Club of Great      Britain, Arthur Hammond, Secretary, Dept. TMEN, 29A Manor      Road, Brackley, Northants., England NN136ED.    </p>    <p>      THE KUVASZ. In Turkish the word "kuvasz" means "protector",      so it's be lieved that this breed came to Hungary -      where it's found today - from eastern Turkey ...      probably back in the twelfth century. The dog resembles      both the Great Pyrenees and the Maremma in coat and color.      Its standard height is 28 to 30 inches at the shoulder and      its weight 100 to 115 pounds. With a temperament best      described as "lively", this breed is both highly possessive      of its flock and gentle with its family. Contact the Kuvasz      Club of America, c/o A. Andres, Secretary, Dept. TMEN, 18      South Terrace Avenue, Mount Vernon, New York 10550.    </p>    <p>      THE KOMONDOR. This breed from Hungary bears no resemblance      to the others. Its coat is unique: a long, thick, moplike      mass that hangs in cords or "tassels" from its body, thus      protecting it from inclement weather or predators' teeth.      Literature on the breed is available from the Middle      Atlantic States Komondor Club, c/o Levy, Dept. TMEN, 102      Russell Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. <em>[EDITOR'S      NOTE: For a more extensive discussion, refer to MOTHER NO.      69, page 162. Turn to page 120 for information on ordering      back issues.]</em>    </p>    <p>      THE ANATOLIAN SHEPHERD. These animals were originally bred      on the Anatotlan plateau of Turkey, where they're still      extensively used to protect sheep from wolves. Their coats      range from smooth to shaggy and from light to dark, and      their muzzles are generally dark. Males range from 70 to      100 pounds, and the standard height is 29 inches at the      shoulder. These dogs are gentle to their families but      become very aggressive against predators (either animal or      human) and will fight to kill. There are currently 250      Anatolians registered in the U.S. Contact the Anatolian      Shepherd Dog Club of America, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 1271,      Alpine, California 92001.    </p>    <p>      THE TIBETAN MASTIFF. Mastiff owners claim that the dogs are      the ancestors of many of the canines we've already      discussed, as well as of other working dogs. The breed      dates back to 1200 B.C. and has never been hybridized.      Mastiffs are primarily used today as guardians in the      villages of Tibet and Nepal and sometimes accompany the      nomadic caravans that roam those countries. (The dogs      travel well, and have adapted to the rigors of mountain and      high desert life.) This is one of the world's rarest breeds      . . . fewer than 100 are registered in the United States.      Inquiries can be sent to the Tibetan Mastiff Club, c/o      Rohrer, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 160, Pearblossom, California      93553.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: As all these clubs are non-profit      organizations and operate on extremely small budgets, we      recommend that any readers interested in receiving      information about the breeds described here enclose a      dollar or two to help defray expenses.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>If you decide to purchase a pup for livestock      protection purposes, insist on a registered dog, with      papers to prove that it comes from quality stock.</em>    </p>
