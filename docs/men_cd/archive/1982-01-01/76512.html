                       <p>		  The frost reaches its gnarled fingers deep into the dark      earth . . . and on windless, crystalline nights trees creak      as temperatures plummet. The garden, wrapped in winter's      dreamless sleep, awaits next spring's awakening    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by THE ZONES    </h5>    <p>      warmth. Get out the new seed catalogs, and-as the      family basks in the wood fire's glow-plan next      summer's successes.    </p>        <p>		  Here's a summary, arranged by climatic zone, of the      earliest planting dates for spring crops. The letter "s"      indicates that seedlings can be set out at the time      specified . . . "J" stands for January . . . and "F" for      February. Zone 10 (last frost about February 1): beets J/F,      broccoli s J, brussels sprouts s J, cabbage s J/F,      cantaloupe late F, carrots J/F, cauliflower s J, celery J,      collards s J/F, corn F, cucumbers late F, eggplant s F,      endive F, kale J, kohlrabi J, leeks J, lettuce J, mustard      J/F, onions early J, parsley J, peas J/F, peppers s F,      potatoes J/F, radishes J/F, spinach J/F, summer squash F,      Swiss chard J/F, tomatoes s F, turnips J/F. Zone 9 (last      frost about March 1): beets F, broccoli s F, brussels      sprouts s F, cabbage s mid-J/F, carrots F, cauliflower s      mid-J/mid-F, celery F, collards s mid-J/F, endive F, kale      F, kohlrabi F, leeks mid-J/mid-F, lettuce J/F, mustard F,      onions early J, parsley J, peas J/F, potatoes mid-J/F,      radishes J/F, spinach J/F, Swiss chard F, turnips      mid-J/F.<br />      Zone 8 (last frost about March 15): beets mid-F, broccoli s      mid-F, brussels sprouts s mid-F, cabbage s F, carrots      mid-F, cauliflower s F, collards s mid-F, endive mid-F,      kale mid-F, kohlrabi midF, leeks F, lettuce F, mustard      mid-F, onions F, parsley mid-F, peas F, potatoes F,      radishes mid-J/F, spinach mid-J/F, Swiss chard mid-F,      turnips F.<br />      Zone 7 (last frost about April 1): cabbage s mid-F,      cauliflower s mid-F, leeks mid-F, lettuce mid-F, onions      mid-F, peas mid-F, potatoes mid-F, radishes mid-F, spinach      F, turnips mid-F.<br />      Zone 6 and north: Bundle up and keep on planning.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NEW FOR '82</strong>    </p>    <p>      New varieties for the 1982 gardening season abound, and      we'll start our annual survey-as usual-with the      All-America selections. This year the winning vegetables      are a toothsome pair of squash. A new bush scallop variety,      called Peter Pan, matures five days earlier than other      "patty pan" squash . . . sets large numbers of meaty fruits      on compact, runnerless plants . . . and is resistant to      many kinds of weather stress. The second of the two Bronze      Medal winners, Jersey Golden Acorn, is a dual-purpose fruit      (much like the popular Kuta) that can be eaten young as a      summer squash or allowed to mature on the vine and stored      for winter feasting. The summer version of the Jersey      Golden-which is table-ready just 50 days after      sowing-tastes like sweet corn . . . while the fully      grown fruit is sweet and tender, with less fiber than green      acorn squash.<br />    </p>    <p>      From the Corn Belt orchards of Henry Field comes a      remarkable new pear that offers a double harvest. When      picked in August, about two months before maturity,      Turnbull Giant pears have the tart flavor and crisp, juicy      flesh of a fine apple . . . with none of the grainy texture      or tough skin usually associated with unripe pears. Leave      some on the tree, though, and in a couple of months you'll      have a crop of sweet, butter-smooth fruit, dripping with      juice.<br />    </p>    <p>      Burpee's 1982 catalog features six vegetable introductions      for 1982. There are two new squash: Richgreen zucchini (its      open habit helps you spot the dark green fruits before they      reach baseball-bat size) and Early Acorn Hybrid (a      semi-bush variety that matures a good-sized crop close to      the plant's crown). Zippy Hybrid pepper is mildly hot and      resembles a cayenne in all but pungency. Bonanza broccoli      puts forth a strong central head and then follows with lots      of side shoots. Two Seasons Hybrid Chinese cabbage holds      forth the promise of both spring and fall crops for those      who can't get enough of the delicious green, and the Basket      King tomato bears clusters of four to seven fruits on its      cascading branches (it's ideal for pot culture).    </p>    <p>      One of our favorite small mail order houses, Epicure Seeds,      has combed the European catalogs and brought back a handful      of new varieties. There's Pirat lettuce (a speckled-leaf      butterhead known in Germany as Sprenkel) . . . the Di      Brindisi melon from Italy (delicious as an antipasto dish      when accompanied by prosciutto) . . . the succulent      Meraviglia di Venezia yellow pole bean . . . Winter Density      lettuce (a cross between butterhead and romaine, with the      sweetness of the former and the vigor of the latter) . . .      and a French cut-and-come-again lettuce that's easier to      eat than it is to pronounce: Feuille de Chene Blonde.    </p>    <p>      Joseph Harris Seeds has long been known for its trustworthy      cultivars. This year the company is featuring four new      vegetables: Bush Kentucky Wonder snap beans (with all the      flavor of the pole type, but on sturdy 20-inch plants) . .      . Silver Prince corn (it's similar to the highly popular      Silver Queen but earlier, more vigorous, and with a      freshness-preserving "sugar extender" gene) . . . Sugar Rae      snap pea (abundant crops on vines 26-30 inches high) . . .      and Symphony Bicolor sweet corn (combining the tenderness      and flavor of hybrid types with the sweetness of the "super      sweet" kinds). See page 166, for the names and addresses of      these and other mail order firms.    </p>
