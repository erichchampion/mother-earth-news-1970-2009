                    <p>      Here's an introduction to a useful-and      marketable-skill that anybody can acquire.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Terry Krautwurst</strong>    </p>    <p>      In his article "Weld It Yourself . . . and Make a Few Bucks      to Boot" (MOTHER NO. 72, page 130), Adrian B. DeBee gave      readers an admirably thorough explanation of the basic      tools and materials required to perform simple arc welding      . . . and he suggested a number of ways to make money with      the skill, too.<br />      <br />      Well, now that you know the <em>what</em> and the      <em>why</em> of the subject, it's time to get to the heart      of the matter: <em>how</em> to weld. And even though it's      true that professional tradespeople spend years honing      their skills to a high degree of technical proficiency,      it's just as true that you as an everyday do-it-yourselfer-      can pick up all the <em>fundamental</em> techniques you're      ever likely to need in just a couple of afternoons!<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>READY, SET. . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      OK, let's say you've read last issue's article and followed      Adrian's advice pretty much to the letter. You've bought      yourself a good 230-volt AC "buzz box" (or a comparable      machine) . . . you've gathered together all the other      necessities: a head shield ( <em>and</em> goggles to wear      underneath, to protect your eyes from sparks and chips even      when your face plate is raised), gauntlet gloves, a heavy      natural-fiber or leather jacket and cap, and rubber-soled      boots . . . and you've prepared a clean, well-ventilated,      dry work area.<br />      <br />      While we're at it, let's assume that you've also bought a      supply of E6011 and/or E6013 all-purpose mild-steel      electrodes . . . probably a few pounds each of 1/8"- and      5/32"-diameter rods, for use with metal 1/8" thick or more,      will be all you'll need for now. (It's important to prevent      the rods from absorbing humidity, so keep them dry.)<br />      <br />      Finally, we'll figure that-to round out your      materials supply-you've gone to a local metals outlet      and bought a pile of flat steel scrap in varying      thicknesses (anything from 1/8" to 3/8" is good for      practice) for about a nickel a pound. (When you're done      with the material, you should be able to sell it back to a      salvage dealer for about 3 cents a pound! )<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>. . . GO!</strong> Position a piece of steel plate      on your work surface and-since you'll be practicing      with metal of around 1/4" in thickness-place a 1/8"      rod in the grooves of the electrode holder, and set your      machine's amperage to around 90 or 100. Connect the ground      cable to the work piece, but be sure it's positioned far      enough away so that it won't interfere with your weld. Or,      if the steel is on a conductive surface (such as the      angle-iron table shown in the photos), simply clamp the      wire <em>close</em> to the work. Then-keeping the      electrode well away from any metal-turn the machine      on.<br />      <br />      Now, you're ready to strike the arc. <em>Put your face      shield down and warn others around you not to stare at the      bright light no matter what.</em> OK. Go ahead and start      the arc by holding the rod about 20째 from vertical and      lightly scratching the tip of the electrode across about an      inch of the area to be welded, drawing the rod toward you      and then quickly raising its tip to about 1/4 inch above      the metal.<br />      <br />      What <em>should</em> happen is that-as a result of      scratching the protective flux from the end of the      electrode-current will flow through the rod, leap      across the gap, and form an extremely hot (6500째F)      electric arc that melts both the end of the wand and the      metal being welded. Because of the magnetic forces set in      motion, the molten metal from the electrode travels      <em>across</em> the arc and is deposited on the steel,      mingling with that metal to form a weld.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, what <em>will</em> happen the first few      times you try to strike an arc is what's called "freezing":      You won't lift the tip of the rod quite quickly enough, and      the danged thing will stick and try to weld itself to the      metal. A good strong twist should free the electrode . . .      but if that doesn't work, <em>turn the machine off</em> ,      release the rod from its holder, and-after it has cooled      somewhat-wiggle the stick free from the steel, or knock it      with a hammer, and start over. (It's likely that you will      have to try again and again-"freezing" can be      absolutely maddening for the beginner-but sooner or      later you'll develop a smooth flick-of-the-wrist motion      similar to striking a match, and you'll suddenly wonder why      you ever found the process difficult.)<br />      <br />    </p>            		    				        <p>      <strong>1] A well-sealed, but inoperable, junk      refrigerator-equipped with a 120-volt thermostat      rigged to a 150-watt bulb-makes a nice low-humidity      electrode storage bin. The control is set at 95째. [2]      These beads demonstrate, from left to right, the results of      too-cold through too-hot fusion. The fourth-and      best-weld penetrated well and "puddled" rather than      "stacked up". [3] Beveled joint edges on thick steel      improve the bond. [4] Clamp the work tightly to your bench      (the welding table shown will be featured in a future      issue). [5] Arcing and . . . [6] the completed weld. [7]      Final grinding smooths the metal for</strong> <strong>. . .      [8] a perfect joint!</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXERCISE NO. 1: LAYING A BEAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you've struck an arc-and are consistently able      to hold the stick close enough to the metal's surface to      maintain the circuit-the intense heat and flow of      molten material will continue until the rod is used up. But      before you can expect to put this action to work to join      two pieces of metal, you must learn to control the      flow/fusion process . . . to the point where you can      produce a symmetrical, <em>deeply penetrating</em>      weld.<br />      <br />      Developing this bit of eye-hand coordination can,      unfortunately, be somewhat like learning to walk a      tightrope on roller skates in a wind, because the quality      of the bead you produce will depend on how well you balance      three important factors: [1] the amperage setting, [2] the      length of arc, and [3] the speed at which you move the      electrode (known as "rate of travel").<br />      <br />      The amperage setting required will depend mainly on the      thickness and type of metal you want to weld, and on the      size of the electrode used to do the job. (The owner's      manual with your machine will likely include a table of      recommended rod sizes for given metal thicknesses.) For      now, though, let's stick with our approximately 1/4" steel      and a 1/8" rod . . . in which case an amperage setting of      between 85 and 115 will be appropriate.<br />      <br />      (Start at a setting of 90 amps and then adjust up or down      as you observe the results of each bead.) Now, strike an      arc (your face mask is down, right?) and hold the electrode      so that it leans toward you at an angle of about 70 to      80째 to the work. Starting at the edge of the piece      farthest from you, draw the electrode back toward your      body. Don't try any side-to-side movement for now . . .      just pull the rod back in a straight line, evenly and      steadily: not too fast (speed will cause you to produce a      weld that's shallow and too narrow) and not too slow (the      material will pile up and ripple excessively in such a      case). By looking closely, you'll be able to see a crater      forming in the metal at the end of the arc . . . try to      keep the flow of material into the back of that cavity      smooth and consistent.<br />      <br />      Of course, while you're doing your best to control the rate      of travel, another complication is taking place: Your      welding rod is melting, and-as a result-the length of your      arc is getting longer. So while you're pulling the      electrode toward you, you must also continually push the      tip gradually forward to compensate for the rod's      ever-decreasing length.<br />      <br />      As a general rule of thumb, try to keep arc distance equal      to the diameter of the electrode being used. When the gap      is correct, you'll hear a "crackling" sound . . . but when      the arc is too long, you'll hear a hollow, blowing noise.      So try to develop an ear, as well as an eye and a feel, for      arc length. Once you've completed a pass, let the fresh      weld cool from red-hot to black, then use a chipping hammer      to knock off the thin outer crust of slag. Underneath will      be . . . well, anything from a disappointing mass of pits      and bubbles to an attractive, evenly distributed, deep,      strong weld. The ideal bead is about 1-1/2 to 2 times as      wide as the diameter of the electrode, and as long as the      amount of rod used.<br />      <br />      You can't expect to get a perfect specimen, of course,      until you've had quite a bit of practice . . . so keep at      it, experiment with amp settings and arc distances and      travel speed-try your hand at moving the electrode from      side to side in a close zigzag or circular motion, too and      analyze each bead's appearance. If you make an honest      effort to be your own worst critic, you'll be able to      detect what you're doing wrong, and correct it. Photo 2,      showing beads formed on amperage settings ranging from too      low (cold) to too high (hot) should help, but here are some      other things to look for.<br />      <br />      <em>Slag pockets:</em> black, nonmetallic deposits in the      weld. Try keeping the electrode movement steady . . . and      hold the rod at an angle closer to perpendicular.<br />      <br />      <em>Undercutting:</em> a shallow groove along one or both      sides of a weld. This usually results from moving the      electrode too fast. Slow down a little.<br />      <br />      <em>Spatter:</em> droplets of metal around the weld. It      isn't a serious problem, but-if adjusting amperage doesn't      cure it-you may be holding the electrode too high.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXERCISE NO. 2: A BUTT WELD</strong>    </p>		<p>		Now that you're running beautiful beads consistently    (well, almost), you're ready to start actually joining two    pieces of metal. Again, we'll use 1/4" steel (be sure the    edges to be fused are square) . . . and 1/8" rod. If you    happen to have two pieces that are more than 1/4", you should    probably bevel the top edges, as we've shown in Photo 3, to    about 45째 . . . to assure a deep bond.<br />    <br />    In any case, position the two sides so that they almost, but    don't quite, touch (to allow for expansion) . . . and clamp    there down securely. Because of the tremendous heat applied    during welding and the stresses created by the variations in    temperature along the seam as the work progresses and later    cools-the fresh weld and any adjacent metal are especially    subject to distortion. Therefore, if the plates are allowed    to move, the steel will often twist away from the joint,    and/or the electrode material will crack. Clamping the pieces    is the easiest way to minimize the effects of these forces,    though a "tack weld"-just a good, penetrating 1/4" dot    of metal placed at both ends of the joint, and used in    addition to the clamps, will assure a positive bond.<br />    Now, set your machine to about 115 amps and strike an arc.    Start the weld at the top of the plates and draw it toward    you . . . but this time, hold the rod nearly perpendicular    and move the stick side to side in a tight "Z" pattern. If    you're using an E6011 electrode-which penetrates a bit    more deeply than does an E6013-you may also want to    keep the arc length somewhat higher than the rule-of-thumb    1/8".,At the end of the run, raise the wand about 1/4 inch    and hold it there briefly to allow the cavity in the final    half-inch or so of the weld to fill with metal.<br />    <br />    Let the work cool for a minute, then knock off the slag.    Ideally, you should have a weld that penetrates into the    seam, both horizontally and vertically, about 1/8 inch. The    surface of the fresh metal should be only slightly    convex.<br />    If you're satisfied with your results, smooth the work with a    hand grinder to give it the appearance you'd want for, say, a    box stove (see Photos 7 and 8). On the other hand, if the    weld is poor, you may want to break it open-by twisting    the pieces in a vise or hammering them-to get a closer    look at the results of your efforts. Is fusion complete all    along the seam? Are there slag pockets? Keep a critical eye    out for weaknesses in the work . . . and be prepared to    practice correcting them.<br />    On subsequent runs, you may want to try welding both sides of    the plates . . . or attempt to apply a second layer over the    first (clean the initial seam's slag off completely, then use    a wide but close zigzag-or crescent or    figure-eight-motion to cover the first weld). Remember    . . . the more you experiment, the more you'll learn.<br />    <br />		</p>    <p>      <strong>EXERCISE NO. 3: A TEE WELD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Now, you're ready to try to join a horizontal 1/4" steel      plate to a vertical, perpendicular one. You can use clamps      and a length of angle iron to keep the pieces positioned .      . . or, better yet, simply lay a small tack weld on both      sides of each end of the vertical plate, to hold the      members in place.<br />      <br />      Since we're only <em>practicing</em> tee-weld technique,      1/8" rod should be sufficient . . . but because more filler      material is required here than for a simple butt joint, a      5/32" electrode (again, either E6011 or E6013) would be      even better.<br />      <br />      When using the smaller wand, you'll need to slow your rate      of travel in order to build up sufficient metal in the      joint . . . but the decreased speed will cause increased      heat and-therefore-a higher possibility of      metal distortion. So if you have the larger-size electrode      available, or if you're working on a "for real" project,      5/32" is the way to go.<br />      <br />      Set your machine for about 130 amps and strike an arc. Now,      hold the rod so that it bisects the 90째 angle formed by      the two pieces (in other words, so that it's 45째 from      vertical) but leans at an angle of about 80째 out from      the corner where you intend to start the weld. Point the      tip of the electrode <em>in the direction of travel</em> .      . . aim the arc directly at the juncture of the two plates      . . . and use a forward, oscillating, circular motion to      bring the weld metal up and into either side of the seam.      Keep your work as even as possible, and be sure to build      sufficient material all along both the vertical and      horizontal planes.<br />      <br />      When the weld has cooled, examine the seam . . . chances      are you'll be looking at real messes after your first few      attempts. (Undercutting is a common problem with tee welds      . . . to correct it, try increasing or decreasing arc      length, or reducing travel speed or amperage.) Be sure to      break the weld with a hammer to get a closer look at the      degree of penetration. If it isn't deep enough, try, try      again. You'll get it right (eventually).<br />      <br />			</p>    <p>      <strong>IS THAT ALL THERE IS TO IT?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Well, the answer to <em>that</em> question is yes . . . and      no. You <em>will</em> be able to handle most simple      projects once you've perfected the fundamentals outlined      here, but this article does <em>not</em> tell you      everything there is to learn. There are dozens of types of      welds, literally hundreds of kinds of electrodes for      various purposes, and scores of special procedures. And      your arc machine can do more than just weld . . . it can      cut (not as smoothly as an oxyacetylene outfit, but you can      grind the edges after cutting, to get an acceptable      surface) . . . it can be used to thaw frozen pipes . . .      and-with the proper attachments-it can even braze and      solder.<br />      <br />      Of course, learning to weld is like learning to do almost      anything: The best way is just to <em>do</em> it.      Concentrate on the basics until you really have them      perfected. And naturally, if you know someone who      welds-or have access to an adult education or      technical school course of some kind-you're sure to      benefit from face-to-face instruction.<br />      <br />      The key is <em>practice</em> . . . and as soon as you've      perfected your skills sufficiently, you can even get paid      while you learn . . . by making simple-but      salable-items such as flowerpot stands and the      like.<br />      <br />      Before long, you'll be saving-and making-money      as a bona fide welder!    </p>        <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Several manufacturers have put together some      excellent publications that should be instructive to both      the novice and the experienced welder.
