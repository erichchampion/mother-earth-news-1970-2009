            <p>      Issue # 73- January/February 1982    </p>    <p>      There's land for the hearty... and the price is right!    </p>        <p>      ILLUSTRATION COURTESY OF BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT    </p>        <p>      Recently, one of our readers informed us that the Bureau of      Land Management (an agency of the Department of the      Interior) was planning to open up a large tract of Alaskan      land under a homesteading-type program. "Please tell folks      that there's free land to be had by those with the guts to      take it," urged the writer.    </p>    <p>      Well, friends, "guts" is the key word in that last      sentence. During December 1981 the BLM was to have made      available 10,000 acres in the heart of Alaska, in an effort      to encourage people to establish their homes and businesses      in the sparsely populated forty-ninth state. However, the      land is pretty rugged . . . and it would take a person with      well-honed survival and homesteading skills to make a      successful go on his or her claim. The land isn't entirely      free, either... it will cost a reasonable $2.50 an acre to      those who successfully fulfill the settlement requirements      and pay the filing fees necessary to obtain legal ownership      of the tract.    </p>    <p>      MOM asked a BLM representative what kind of environment a      would-be pioneer might face. "The land is extremely      isolated, with minimal tree coverage, and there's no road      access," the spokesperson replied. "The settler would have      to have resources of considerable size to fly in-or      barge in-food and fuel supplies. Also, since the      acreage is in the state's interior, there's not much water      and there are negative temperatures much of the year. It'd      take a lot of effort."    </p>    <p>      Yet in spite of the territory's drawbacks, the Alaska      Settlement Program does offer an experienced homesteader a      very attractive opportunity to obtain land for little more      than sweat equity. And if there's enough public interest in      this initial offering, the BLM may open up other large      Alaskan tracts in a similar manner.    </p>    <p>      Here's a little general information on the property that's      currently available: The acreage is located north of Lake      Minchumina (the northern portions can be reached by      riverboat along the Kantishna River). Three types of claims      may be made: homesite, headquarters (generally used for      big-game guiding and trapping operations), and trade and      manufacturing (these claims may be used for businesses such      as roadhouses, lodges and recreation cabins, the production      of handcrafts for sale, and so forth). The maximum size of      the homesite and headquarters-site claims is five acres ...      while business claims may run as large as 80 acres. The      residency and/or improvement requirements for each of the      three types of claims vary, but in each case the land will      cost $2.50 an acre, once an applicant has met the necessary      criteria.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like more details on this program, you can request      a brochure called "Settlement in Alaska", as well as more      information on the kind of claim you're most interested in,      from the Bureau of Land Management, Alaska State Office,      Dept. TMEN, Anchorage Federal Building, 701 C Street, Box      13, Anchorage, Alaska 99513.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Apparently it can be done . . . the      authors of the article about skijoring (page 58) live near      Lake Minchumina.</em>    </p>
