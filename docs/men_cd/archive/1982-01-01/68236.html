            <p>      Issue # 73- January/February 1982    </p>    <p>      On a tip from reader Franklin Beatty, we sent Randy Kidd      out to have a look at...    </p>                            <h3>      Randy Kidd    </h3>    <p>      John Olberding is definitely a man who's taken the Johnny      Cash song "One Piece at a Time" to heart. For several      years, John watched-from his vantage point in a      nearby pizza parlor-truckload after truckload of      perfectly usable goods being carted to the county landfill.      And one day he decided to see if he could turn a few of      those "treasures" his way.    </p>    <p>      To do so, Olberding got himself a <em>job</em> at the dump,      and quickly gained permission to take home whatever he      could use ... as long as he didn't attempt to make a profit      from his windfalls. So, one piece at a time, John loaded      the throwaways into the rear of an old red van, hauled the      stash to an empty lot for storage, and-when he had      accumulated enough free material-began building his      dream house.    </p>    <p>      With the help of a few out-of-pocket bucks (the scavenger      tells most folks that he's spent "about $1,000", but admits      that the actual figure is probably closer to $700), John      built a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath, 24' X 96' (24'      X 32' upstairs), two-story home ... complete with a      three-car garage, an enclosed breezeway, and a basement.      And he had enough leftover "freebies" to furnish the      interior of the dwelling!    </p>    <p>      John's house is no thrown-together shamble of shingles,      either. The structure is entirely sided in metal coated      with white, baked-on enamel . . . "excess" material that a      local contractor saw fit to pitch out in large quantities.      And the building is assembled like a fortress. Olberding      framed his dream house in 3 X 6's, instead of the normal 2      X 4's, and then he put the boards on 12"-rather than      the standard 16" or 24"-centers. Furthermore, since      people didn't seem to care what kind of wood they were      throwing out, some of John's framing was done with oak.      Even the garage is as solid as the proverbial rock: 3 X 14      and 3 X 16 beams brace the front, and the ceiling is made      up of 2 X 6's and 2 X 8's ... all lumber that the scrounger      thought he should use simply "because it was there".    </p>    <p>      "There's at least four inches of insulation stuffed into      every open space I could find," John says. "The wood, the      insulation, and the metal siding were among the easiest      materials to get, so I didn't skimp on them." In fact,      those three items were so plentiful in Olberding's      "ware-heap" that a couple of his neighbors have built      two-story houses (on the same theme as John's) using the      leftover <em>leftovers</em> !    </p>    <p>      The list of his free-for-the-carting housing materials      doesn't stop at the front door, either (by the way, that      portal is a solid oak throwaway that John fitted with a      tossed-out antique knob). All the doors, windows, bathroom      fixtures, appliances, living room furniture, cabinet doors,      and even a walk-in refrigerator for meat storage made their      way in the back of the red van from the landfill to      Olberding's residence.    </p>    <p>      Some castoff items were available in such steady supply      that John actually had to dream up ways to use them. For      example, most of his floors are two layers deep in      carpet-which makes a walk through his "trash house"      feel like a stroll across a well-sodded golf      course-and even then, there was enough rug material      left over to cover some walls and hand rails. Finally, when      John could think of nowhere else to use the versatile      carpeting, he simply traded his surplus for a complete      bedroom suite.    </p>    <p>      Of course, even though some items were thrown away in      prodigious quantities, others were a little scarce. John      had a great many white ceiling tiles, for example, but they      weren't all the same style. So he simply mixed the      different tiles to create a patterned effect. The basement      blocks also have a unique appearance: They're a mixture of      bright orange and concrete gray. When questioned about the      curious combination, John explained that the brightly      colored building blocks had come from a torn-down A & W      Root Beer stand.    </p>    <p>      The list of landfill windfalls goes on and on. John muses      that people often throw things out for virtually no reason      at all. His refrigerator, as an example, has a small      scratch on its side . . . but its innards work just fine.    </p>    <p>      One gent carted a rototiller to the dump that looked OK to      our landfill lookout. When John asked, the man explained      that he'd had to gas a hornet's nest from under the tiller      the previous fall, and when he started the engine up in the      spring, it caught fire. Olberding replaced the burned      spark-plug wire, and the tiller has faithfully turned his      garden ever since. In another instance a lady informed the      scrounger that she didn't think there was anything much      wrong with the clock she was throwing out. Sure enough,      John replaced the battery, and the timepiece has run "like      clockwork" on his kitchen wall for the last three years.    </p>    <p>      As you might expect, Olberding has seen some interesting      human dramas during his stint at the landfill. One time a      young man backed up to the dump site in a      pickup-spewing gravel from beneath the      wheels-and furiously heaved out a load that included      a stove, a dresser, and a large selection of women's      clothing. Later that week yet <em>another</em> rapidly      driven pickup arrived, this time with an angry lady at the      wheel. She hurled out a collection of guns, fishing poles,      and men's clothing. Now whenever something of this sort      occurs, the landfill employees try to pick up the discards      and store them in a warehouse in case there's a change of      mind on the part of the people discarding the valuable      merchandise. But in this case, neither party returned ...      not even <em>after</em> the divorce was final.    </p>    <p>      John Olberding's unconventional approach to housing design      didn't stop with his method of obtaining building      materials. He's also put together some pretty nifty      recycled equipment for taking advanrage of alternative      energy sources. John's furnace, for instance, is set up to      use solar energy, electricity, wood, or fuel oil ...      depending on which one happens to be the easiest and least      expensive to acquire at the time. Furthermore, the      trash-can tinkerer has built a panemone wind machine that      keeps his tank of bait fish well aerated during the angling      season.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you don't build a house from toss-outs without      having a good bit of ingenuity ... and John <em>has</em>      demonstrated his ability to see a treasure in another      penson's trash. What's more, we all know that erecting a      dwelling calls for a lot of sweat-of-the-brow effort. John      spent six and a half years-nights, weekends, and      vacations-building his house ... but the result is,      he feels, well worth the effort expended.    </p>    <p>      Olberding says that he had the house appraised at around      $60,000 a few years back ... so he's obviously been well      compensated for his work. But the biggest reward, in John's      mind, is the personal satisfaction he's gained. "You know,"      he told me, "I'm pretty proud of myself. There's been a      great deal of unexpected interest in this project, and I      feel pretty darn good about that.    </p>    <p>      "Now," John continued, "if I could just get folks to      realize how crazy it is to throw out all this perfectly      usable material-and if I could convince landfill      operators that people who want this 'junk' should be      allowed to use it-I'd be happy."    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Though many people are under the      impression that Environmental Protection Agency regulations      prohibit the removal of all materials from sanitary      landfills, federal law is concerned only with items      classified as hazardous waste. In most regions, landfill      salvage is prohibited on the state or local level...      because of the threat of liability from injuries to      individuals removing material from a dump. It's frequently      possible, however, to make an arrangement with the landfill      operator to salvage useful materials. So speak to the      person who runs your local landfill, and see it you can      help him or her stem the tide of waste.</em>    </p>
