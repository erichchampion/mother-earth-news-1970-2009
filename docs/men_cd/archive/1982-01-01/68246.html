            <p>      Issue # 73- January/February 1982    </p>    <p>      You can make your own shop tools and probably earn a living      besides if you...    </p>        <p>      STAFF PHOTOS    </p>        <p>      It shouldn't take more than $30 or so to<br /> outfit a home      foundry... and you can raid your kitchen or<br /> workshop for      goodies, too!    </p>    <p>      The molten alloy is poured into the sprue, and will come      out<br /> the riser.    </p>        <p>      Remove the pattern by "rapping" <br />it in all directions, then      lifting it. Notice the three<br /> runners and terminal gates.    </p>    <p>      The finished billet can now be<br /> machined.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dave Gingery</strong>    </p>    <p>      It's funny how, sometimes, an event will sort of get stuck      in your mind. I can clearly remember, some 20 years ago,      holding a complicated-looking-and      expensive-machine part in my hand and thinking how      difficult it must be to form that piece. Today, however,      I'm able not only to duplicate that part (for pennies), but      to make just about any component I need-to equip my      shop, fix my car, or merely tickle my fancy-by going      no farther than my own back yard!    </p>    <p>      Did I buy a tool-and-die company? Well, not quite . .      instead, you might say I "founded" one, for a total      investment of about $30 and the time it took me to learn,      through experience, the basics of home metal casting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FIRST, YOU GET A CHICKEN...</strong>    </p>    <p>      Believe it or not, it's fairly easy to establish a compact      foundry at home, since-if you enjoy puttering around      the house-you probably already have on hand most of      what you need to build one. And metal casting (a craft      that's been practiced for thousands of years by so-called      "primitive" people) harbors no secrets: If you can whittle      a whistle, you can make a pattern ... if you've ever built      sand castles, you can make a mold ... and if you can boil      water, you can melt metal and pour it into that mold. It      really is that simple.    </p>    <p>      Of course, I never intended to take up foundry work just      for fun. Someone (whose name is long forgotten but whose      message has hung on) once told me that a metal lathe is the      only machine in a shop that can duplicate itself. So,      thinking about the old chicken soup recipe that starts out      "first you get a chicken", I figured that if I could build      a lathe-using my new casting skills-nothing      would prevent me from going hog-wild and manufacturing all      the other tools I needed to outfit my workshop.    </p>    <p>      However, I hadn't counted on the unsolicded      <em>business</em> that came my way once I'd set up my home      foundry (and has often kept me too happily busy to cast      tools for myself). When word got around that I was casting      metal, it seemed the whole dang county was beating a path      to my door, looking for me to make kitchen utensils ...      repair tool parts ... or fabricate structural members (for      windplants, greenhouses, geodesic domes, and more) in      exchange for goods, services, or cold cash. And after a      while I began casting distinctive objects of art      that-with the help of a simple on-site foundry      demonstration-paved my way with green at local flea markets      and crafts festivals. where enthusiastic onlookers fairly      tripped over themselves to better their view ... and      lighten their billfolds!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BASIC COMPONENTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      When I said it doesn't take much material to set up a small      foundry, I meant it. For example, wood charcoal      is-historically speaking-the "classic" foundry      fu el... though the casting industry now uses natural gas      almost exclusively. But after an unsuccessful attempt at      using a homemade gas burner, I switched to charcoal      briquets and have stuck with them eversince.    </p>    <p>      Besides being inexpensive and readily available, the solid      fuel can fire a foundry that's set up in a rural area,      where there might not be a gas line. Better yet, the      charcoal can even be manufactured right on the homestead      (simply cover ricks of hardwood with earth and allow them      to smolder from within for several weeks). Doing it      yourself has an advantage other than low cost, too, because      homemade charcoal doesn't contain the binding      agents-found in store-bought briquets-that      eventually create airflow-blocking klinkers in the furnace.      (The charcoal-making process also yields gaseous and liquid      by-products-such as methane, wood alcohol, and other      volatiles-that can have value in themselves.)    </p>    <p>      Naturally, to use the fuel efficiently, I needed a suitable      oven... and I built just such a furnace, out of scrap, for      about $20. It's nothing more than a drum, with a removable      lid, that's lined all around with about two inches of      castable refractory ... has an air-feed tube built into its      bottom ... and is equipped with an adjustable-for-flow      blower to supply the draft necessary to create intense      heat.    </p>    <p>      Before constructing my furnace, I first determined how      large it would have to be to handle the parts I planned to      make. I'd suggest that a beginner locate a vessel at least      the size of a 50-pound refrigerant container, then try to      salvage a 30-pound canister from the same source.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps better yet, if you can find a 30-gallon drum and a      5-gallon paint pail, you can build a furnace that'll be      tall enough to accommodate most pieces of melting scrap, no      matter how oddly they may be shaped. (When doing aluminum      casting, which, because of the low temperatures involved,      is the least difficult-and safest-foundry      craft, I melt down discarded auto pistons almost      exclusively. Most garages will let me have them free for      the taking, and they're made of high-quality alloy. Many of      them do, however, come with connecting rods attached, and      these -along with any other ferrous parts-must be      fished out of the melting pot before the aluminum is      poured.)    </p>    <p>      When you've selected a suitable furnace vessel, prepare it      by first slicing off its lid-near the uppermost      seam-then cutting a hole in its side, close to the      bottom, large enough to accept a 16" section of 1-1/2" feed      pipe. Thread a 90&deg elbow to the inside end of this      nipple, then weld the assembly to the canister wall, with      the elbow pointing upward. Next, cut a hole in the middle      of the lid section, and weld a short length of 2"      muffler tubing in place, allowing it to protrude below the      lid's lip slightly. Then fasten some handles-made      from short pieces of 1/8" X 3/4" flat stock and 6" pieces      of 1/2" pipe-to the sides of the container.    </p>    <p>      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: This design should not, of course, be      thought of as carved in stone. Forexample, one of MOTHER's      experimenters changed it to suit his taste by placing a 2"      pipe inside a 6" well casing and welding center-bored      steel-plate doughnuts, one at its top and another at the      bottom, to form an air-manifold assembly. By terminating      the feed pipe at the casing wall, boring a series of 5/32"      holes through the manifold's upper plate, and fastening a      spring-loaded trapdoor over the opening at the bottom, he      effectively created a furnace that fed air evenly and      provided easy topside ash cleanout.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Because of the extreme temperatures generated within the      furnace, its floor, lid, and inner walls <em>must</em> be      lined with refractory material. Paco      Cast-manufactured by the North Stale Pyrophyllite      Co., Inc., Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 7247, Greensboro, North      Carolina 27407-is a good castable refractory product.      Simply mix up the necessary quantity, following the      instructions on the bag, then fill the bottom of your      furnace container until the material reaches the top of the      air-feed elbow (it'll usually do so at a depth of 1-1/2 to      2 inches).    </p>    <p>      Next, coat the outer skin of the smaller of your two      vessels with oil (to allow for its easy removal after the      wall lining has set) and place it upright on top of the      elbow and the "pasty" base pour, making sure that it's      centered evenly within the furnace drum. Then go on to fill      the wall cavity with refractory as you did the bottom, but      tamp it down as you pour to discourage the formation of air      bubbles. Finish the job by inverting the lid and lining it,      to the level of the muffler pipe, in a similar manner.      (Hint: Weld some short steel bar loops to the inside of the      cap to give the mix something to grip as it sets.) When the      refractory is dry, remove the inner vessel and "cure" the      furnace by burning charcoal in it-closed-for at      least 12 hours.    </p>    <p>      With this done, cut a piece of 1/8" expanded metal into a      disk just large enough to slip inside the furnace, then      attach a blower (my "squirrel cage" puts out about 100      cubic feet per minute and uses a sliding flap damper to      regulate flow ... although an old hair dryer with a      rheostat control would probably work just about as well) to      the feed pipe . . . using a coupling, a welded plate, or      even a piece of bicycle inner tube if that's what it takes      to make the hookup.    </p>    <p>      You can probably construct the second most important      foundry component-the flask-yourself, too. It's      really nothing more than a two-part open-ended box which      holds the sand that forms the mold. The size of your flask      (its top section is called the <em>cope</em> , and its      bottom the <em>drag</em> ) will, of course, depend on the      size of the castings you hope to pour... and you can fit a      simple four-sided <em>cheek</em> between the components to      increase the flask's depth if necessary. However, I'll tell      you how to put together a beginner's box that'll do for      almost any job you'll care to tackle for a while.    </p>    <p>      First, find yourself some clear, straight 1 X 4 and cut      eight sections from it ...four about 10" in length and four      more 12" long. Then trim off eight 2" slices and make the      pair of boxes shown in the diagram, using glue and No. 6 X      1-1/4" wood screws to hold the boards together. (If you      decide to build a larger flask, cut a 1/4" X 1/2" rabbet      into the inner face of both the cope and the drag, all      around, to give the sand something to hold on to.)    </p>    <p>      Now-and be careful with this step-make two sets      of <em>keys</em> (as shown in the accompanying drawing) for      the sides of the flask. It's important that the cope and      drag fit consistently flush, so the mold will separate      cleanly at the parting line. (Some folks prefer using dowel      pins or rods instead of tapered keys, since they leave less      room for error when lifting.) Finally, seal all the wood      with a good waterproofing agent.    </p>    <p>      You'll also need to fashion a <em>riddle</em> and a      <em>molding bench</em> , but both are easy to make. The      first is merely a sand filter, built by nailing together a      16" X 16" frame made from 2 X 4 and tacking some 1/4"      hardware cloth across it (1/8" grid material can be used      for fine detail castings). The molding bench is a 2 X 4      wooden frame about 36" square, with a 1/2" plywood bottom.      Finally, make at least two <em>pattern boards</em> , by      cutting plywood sheets slightly larger than your flask and      coating them with wood sealer.    </p>    <p>      Most of the remaining tools and supplies can be found in      your own kitchen, workshop, or-if you want to get      fancy-at an arts and crafts supply store. You'll need      a wooden hammer handle about 10" long for a rammer ... a      piece of 1/2" conduit or tapered dowel, 6" in length, to      serve as a <em>sprue pin</em> (don't worry about these      terms ... you'll understand what the tools <em>do</em>      later) ... another smooth dowel, 1/2" X 6", for a <em>riser      pin</em> ... an assortment of small spoons and knife blades      ... a sprinkling can (I use a plastic milk jug with holes      drilled in its lid) .. . an iron rod with a hook bent into      one end and a handle into the other ... a 6" cast-iron bean      pot to serve as a <em>crucible</em> ... a pair of      scissors-type tongs at least 24" long (make them from 1/2"      rod, pivoting-at a point closer to the jaws than to      the handles-on a 1/4" bolt, and with a curved steel      band on each jaw that fits the side of the crucible      perfectly) ... a wooden straightedge . . a camel's-hair      artist's brush ... a tin (not aluminum) muffin pan, an      assortment of iron pots and pans of various sizes, and a      small rectangular tin bread pan . . . a <em>rapper</em>      (just a large washer with a steel handle welded to it ...      or a tuning fork) ... and a <em>skimmer</em> , which is a      spoonlike affair with a two-foot rod handle.    </p>    <p>      You will, of course, also need some <em>casting sand</em>      ... which you might as well pick up at a local commercial      foundry, since it's hard to locate appropriate indigenous      material. I find olivine sand (it's brown in color and      contains about 5% bentonite as a bonding agent) to be the      best choice, though black Albany sand also works pretty      well. You'll want to locate some pumice dust, too, to serve      as <em>parting powder</em> (don't try to substitute talcum      because it tends to absorb moisture).    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAKE MOLD...</strong>    </p>    <p>      You're now ready to make a simple mold. First, sift the      dust from your briquets, place them in the bottom of the      furnace over the screen, ignite them, and turn the blower      on. Then prepare the crucible by filling it with aluminum      scrap (be extra careful-especially when melting      pistons-that there's <em>no</em> water trapped in the      parts to be melted).    </p>    <p>      With the coals hot, place the crucible in the furnace and      install the lid. While you're waiting for the alloy to      melt, prepare about five gallons of sand, in your molding      bench, by sprinkling water into it a bit at a time and      tossing it with two wooden blocks to bring it to a      dry-paste consistency (that is, 5% to 7% moisture) which      allows it to remain whole when squeezed, but to break      cleanly when released (you'll probably have to put in some      practice before you'll be able to recognize this stage).      Better yet, mix the sand about 12 hours prior to casting,      so that its wicking effect will have time to distribute the      moisture evenly.    </p>    <p>      Next, place a pattern (it can be a component you want to      duplicate, or a piece of wood or polystyrene foam you've      whittled to a specific shape) on your pattern board, within      the molding bench, and dust it lightly by shaking the      pumice through a sock. Place the drag <em>upside down</em>      over the pattern and-using the riddle-sift your      sand into the drag. Pack the grains firmly around the      pattern with your fingers.    </p>    <p>      When it's covered, pour coarse sand on top till the drag      box is overfilled. With the rammer, tamp the sand tightly      at the corners but somewhat less firmly over the pattern.      Use one of the pattern boards to compress the sand into the      drag with a downward and right-and-left twisting motion.      Strike off the excess material above the edge of the drag      with your straightedge, then vent the mold by piercing the      sand-using a short length of pointed coat-hanger      wire-in several places above and down to the pattern.      Scrape all the fallen sand away from the drag with your      bread pan.    </p>    <p>      At this point, check your crucible to see whether the      aluminum is melted. If it's bright red, it's too hot . . .      and you should reduce the air-feed flow so the molten metal      can just simmer while you complete the mold.    </p>    <p>      Now, go back and flip the drag right side up, redust its      face (with the pattern still inside), and place the cope on      the drag. Put the riser pin (it's used to compensate for      shrinkage during a pour) on the thickest part of the      pattern . . . set the sprue pin into the drag sand at a      point an inch or two from the pattern ... hold the riddle      over the cope ... and repeat the sifting, tamping, and      striking procedures as before.    </p>    <p>      With this done, dig a small <em>pour basin</em> , about an      inch deep and an inch from the sprue pin, with a spoon.. .      and cut a channel, half as deep, from the pit right to the      sprue pin. Vent over the pattern again, then carefully      remove the riser and sprue pins, finger-press the sand      around the basin (taking care not to let any material fall      into the riser ... that is, the hole left by the riser pin)      and-slowly and evenly-separate the cope from      the drag.    </p>    <p>      Take your spoon again and dig a <em>runner</em> in the drag      sand from the sprue, alongside the pattern, ending in a      <em>gate</em> (which is a connecting ditch leading directly      to the pattern), and press the sand down as before.      (Actually, in some cases, more than one runner and gate      might be used.) Now, swab a thin film of water around the      edge of the pattern with your brush, and prepare to remove      the original by first threading a small wood screw into      some convenient part of it, then tapping the screw back and      forth and all around with the rapper till the pattern      loosens and lifts easily. Repair the mold if it's damaged      in any way, blow any sand from the area of the impression,      and carefully replace the cope, double-checking its fit.      You're now ready to make a pour, but first cover the      exposed wood of the molding bench, around the flask, with      sand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>... AND POUR A CASTING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Open your furnace and remove any ferrous parts from the      crucible with your hook, then skim the slag from the molten      aluminum's surface (disturbing the melt as little as      possible) and throw it in a waiting iron receptacle. Lift      the crucible from the oven with the hook, set it down in an      iron frying pan, and grab it <em>firmly</em> with the      tongs. Pour the molten alloy into the basin and sprue till      it comes out of the riser, then dump any unused fluid      aluminum into your muffin pan, to form ingots that you can      remelt later.    </p>    <p>      While waiting to part your mold (it'll take 20 to 30      minutes for the casting to cool), you can resift the      surplus sand and store it in a sealable container for next      time (do the same with the sand in the mold after the      casting is complete) and smother your furnace fire (save      the cooled leftover coals ... they'll make your next fire      especially easy to start).    </p>    <p>      Once the time is up, shake out your casting and look it      over. Don't be disappointed if the first efforts are a      little rough. With practice, you'll be able to knock out      work that's consistently suitable for tapping, turning,      milling, or any other kind of machining.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAFETY FIRST!</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is important, so I'm not going to mince words:      <em>Always</em> wear leather gloves and boots <em>and</em>      <em>eye</em> protection when working with the foundry.      <em>Never</em> pour water on molten metal ... always use      sand to prevent, or put out, a pouring-related smolder or      fire. Work in a well-ventilated area or outdoors, and avoid      breathing both the charcoal and the aluminum fumes, because      they <em>are</em> toxic. Don't make a pour over bare wood      or concrete, and never set your furnace down on a wooden      floor ... raise it up on firebrick or refractory. And      remember: Keep water-in <em>any</em> amount-out      of your crucible!    </p>    <p>      <strong>YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW</strong>    </p>    <p>      You won't likely manage a perfect pour the first time... in      fact, you might have to make quite a few castings before      you get each step down pat. I can't help you practice, but      I can recommend that you read as much about small-scale      founding as possible ... and after a while you'll become      proficient at what is probably one of the greatest      self-sufficiency skills of all!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: David Gingery is writing a series of      books entitled</em> Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From      Scrap. <em>The first</em> The Charcoal Foundry-      <em>details what he has described here .
