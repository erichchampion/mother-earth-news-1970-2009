            <p>      We'll soon know the truth about three of the products which      are said to control creosote.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Jay W. Shelton and Cathleen Barczys    </h5>        <p>      Creosote, the unburned material that settles out of wood      smoke and accumulates in stoves and chimneys, plagues      everyone who heats with wood. And whether you're worried      about the possible danger of a chimney (and, perhaps,      house) fire . . . the detrimental effects that a clogged      stovepipe might have on your heater's performance . . .      corrosion of the metal in the flue . . . the inconvenience      and/or expense of chimney cleaning . . . or simply the bad      odor and-when there are leaks in the pipe-the      mess caused by such accumulations, you'd no doubt like to      know as much as you can about how to minimize creosote      buildup.    </p>    <p>      Consequently, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) and Shelton Energy      Research have entered into a cooperative research project      to test three devices which, it's claimed, reduce the rate      of accumula tion of creosote. In this issue we'll discuss      some of the options open to concerned woodstove owners, and      describe the research project that's now underway. Then, in      MOTHER NO. 74, we'll report the findings of our tests.    </p>                <h3>      WHAT WE KNOW    </h3>    <p>      The potential for creosote accumulation arises when      unburned materials in the flue gases-including      vapors, tar mist, and soot particles resulting from      incomplete combustion-pass through the chimney. As      the gases cool, the unburned materials can adhere to the      chimney walls. The process is complicated, however, by the      fact that creosote has no single chemical composition,      appearance, density, or ignition temperature. Some of its      common forms are tar, flakes, slag, soot, and liquid.    </p>    <p>      The safest and most reliable way to insure that creosote      accumulations don't become thick enough to cause trouble is      to inspect the chimney regularly, and then clean it when      necessary. After a stove is first installed, the flue      should be checked every week. Then, if the accumulation      rate proves to be slow, the frequency of inspection can be      reduced. The chimney should be swept whenever the deposits      exceed 1/4" in thickness.    </p>    <p>      Chemical chimney cleaners have long been touted as quick,      easy, inexpensive, and reliable reducers or eliminators of      creosote. During recent testing, however, it was shown that      if chemical chimney cleaners work at all, they work only      occasionally. Hence, they can't be relied on to      <em>always</em> keep creosote levels safe. (See our article      "Testing Chemical Chimney Cleaners", in MOTHER NO. 71, page      118. )    </p>    <p>      Another technique that's commonly suggested for controlling      creosote is to burn an intentional short, hot fire every      day or two. The result of such a practice is either a small      (and therefore supposedly relatively safe) chimney fire,      or-more often-a drying and flaking of the thin      tarlike layer . . . with the particles either falling or      being blown out the flue. However, it's vital that there be      only very thin creosote deposits present when this      procedure is used, and only frequent inspections can      establish that fact.    </p>    <p>      If the chimney hasn't been checked or cleaned for along      time-or if the stove has been run at low power for a      few days and a thick, tarry, highly flammable deposit has      built up-an intentional hot burn could trigger a      serious chimney fire. (You should, of course, avoid the      technique if you have any doubts about the safety of the      chimney itself.) In summation, then, though the hot fire      method can work, the numerous "ifs" involved prohibit us      from recommending it.    </p>    <p>      But what <em>can</em> be done to prevent, or at least      minimize, creosote buildup in the first place? Two major      factors affect the rate at which the substance collects,      and solutions to the problem are most likely to be found by      dealing with one or both of them: [1] the density of the      smoke going up the chimney (that is, the amount of unburned      material that remains in the gases) . . . [2] the      temperature of the flue wall (cool walls increase the      condensation and accumulation of creosote).    </p>    <p>      Flue wall temperatures are affected by the type of chimney      used and by its location. Both      double-wall/packed-insulation and      triple-wall/air-insulation prefabricated chimneys do a      better job of holding flue gas heat than do either masonry      or triple-wall/thermosiphon (aircooled) types. And      <em>any</em> of them will prove more satisfactory if      located inside the house, where the exterior is in contact      with warmer air than would be the case if the chimney ran      up the outside of the dwelling. Long runs of stovepipe      between the appliance and the chimney al so decrease flue      gas temperature, and-therefore-increase      creosote accumulation. In fact, the more heat is pulled out      of the fire and flue gases-whether in the stove, in a      heat exchanger accessory, in the stovepipe connector, or in      the chimney-the cooler the smoke will be and the more      the creosote will build up. Thus there's often a conflict      between improving energy efficiency and minimizing      creosote.    </p>    <p>      Stove <em>operation,</em> rather than design, is the single      most important factor affecting smoke density in      traditional woodstoves. As discussed in the last issue of      this magazine (see "Woodstove Smoke" on page 72 of MOTHER      NO. 72), you can limit creosote buildup by simply burning      only small, hot fires in your stove.    </p>    <p>      Contrary to popular belief, <em>very</em> dry wood (that      with less than 15% moisture content) usually      <em>increases</em> creosote accumulation in stoves. In open      appliances such as fireplaces, however, the use of      <em>green</em> wood usually increases creosote      accumulation. Pitchy pines have long been considered to be      heavy creosote producers, but the effect isn't always very      marked.    </p>    <p>      Appliance design can also influence the accumulation of      creosote. In issue 72, MOTHER discussed a number of possi      bly relevant design features . . . including secondary      combustion, catalytic combustion, and the high turbulence      furnace. These approaches are not always effective (good      ideas require good engineering), but each of them does have      promise.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the most appealing option for reducing      creosote-given the large number of woodstoves already      installed in homes-would be some sort of retrofit or      add-on device. There are many such aftermarket products      available today (some of them were described in issue 72),      but-despite their popular appeal-little if any      scientific evidence exists to show whether any of the      devices actually work.    </p>    <p>      In the Shelton Energy Research/THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted)      cooperative research project, three retrofit products are      being tested: a typical barometric draft control (we're      using one made by Steinen of Carolina), the Smoke Dragon      catalytic afterburner, and the Smoke Consumer. (All three      are represented in the accompanying illustrations.)    </p>    <h3>      BAROMETRIC DRAFT CONTROL    </h3>    <p>      Barometric draft regulators are designed to prevent excess      draft, and are usually installed in the stovepipe between      the appliance and the chimney. (Such devices can't, of      course, help a chimney with inadequate draft.) Barometric      draft controls are equipped with a hinged and weighted flap      that's closed when there's no fire in the stove. During      use, however, when the draft in the chimney exceeds a      preselected value, suction pulls the flap open. This lets      room air into the chimney, thereby preventing the draft      from becoming greater than the chosen setting (adjustments      are made by moving the weight attached to the flap).    </p>    <p>      Barometric controls, by limiting draft, also limit the      intensity of the fire. This results in a steadier heat      output and protects the stove and chimney from overheating.      (Such functions are usually more important for coal-fired      than for wood-fired appliances, but they come into play      with large central woodburning furnaces too.)    </p>    <p>      The important issue in this study, however, is the      creosote-controlling potential of barometric draft      regulators. Added air both cools and dilutes the smoke in      the chimney. The dilution air also increases the total flow      up the chimney (despite the fact that it lowers the      temperature of the gas), and therefore yields higher flue      gas velocity. Though the net effect of all these influences      is hard to predict theoretically, studies done at Shelton      Energy Research-using devices other than barometric      draft controls-have shown that the introduction of      dilution air can dramatically reduce creosote accumulation.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Information on obtaining SER's research      report on dilution airand on other projects-is listed      at the end of this article.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Our current tests will, we hope, enable us to measure just      how <em>much</em> less creosote can be expected in a      chimney when a barometric draft regulator is used. In order      to maximize the device's possible effect, we're adjusting      it for the minimum draft setting that's consistent with the      firing rate and heat output typically used in a home      installation.    </p>    <h3>      THE SMOKE CONSUMER    </h3>    <p>      The Smoke Consumer consists of a knitted wire mesh filter      mounted under a cast-iron plate. The assembly can be      positioned either at a right angle or parallel to the smoke      flow . . . just as can a simple stovepipe damper. When the      filter is in the closed (across the flow) position, much of      the flue gas moves through its passageways (of course a      little smoke does flow around the device, in the space      between the plate and the stovepipe wall). The manufacturer      claims that the Smoke Consumer reduces creosote by      filtering out particles. Consequently, the filter requires      periodic cleaning: Maintenance includes a recommended      "continuous burn reactor cycle" once a day-which      involves running the stove hot enough to burn material off      the filter-and manual cleaning of the mesh (by      removing it from the unit) weekly.    </p>        <h3>      THE SMOKE DRAGON    </h3>    <p>      The Smoke Dragon is a catalytic afterburner and heat      exchanger that's de signed to ignite any smoke that hasn't      been burned in the stove itself. The Smoke Dragon's      catalytic combuster-which is made by Corning Glass      Works-is a ceramic honeycomb structure, about six      inches in diameter and three inches long, coated with a      very thin layer of a noble-metal catalyst (such as platinum      and/or palladium).    </p>    <p>      Essentially, the catalyst lowers the ignition temperature      of the smoke from around 1100 or 1200°F to about 400 to      600°F. Thus, if the gas is hot enough, and if it      contains adequate oxygen, much of the material will be      burned in and just above the catalyst. Furthermore, once      the catalyst begins working, the smoke temperature can fall      without ill effects . . . since the heat being generated by      the burning gas in the catalyst will warm the incoming      fumes enough so that they too will ignite. The Smoke Dragon      has the potential for reducing creosote, cutting      air-polluting emissions, and increasing the energy      efficiency of the system with which it's used (much of the      heat released in the combuster is recovered by the heat      exchanger).    </p>    <p>      However, in practice it's difficult to <em>predict</em> the      performance of catalytic devices. Factors that could      influence the overall effectiveness of such a unit include      smoke density, oxygen concentration, the degree of mixing      of oxygen and smoke, flue gas temperature, and the amount      of both intentional and unintentional smoke bypass. Thus,      only through testing can the actual effectiveness of      devices such as the Smoke Dragon be determined.    </p>    <h3>      THE TEST PROCEDURE    </h3>    <p>      An array of identical stoves-some equipped with      devices and others without-are being operated      simultaneously for ten days . . . under a variety of firing      conditions. Each product being tested has been installed on      a pair of stoves (see the diagram of the experimental      setup), and two heaters are being run <em>without</em>      devices . . . to serve as controls. By arranging the      experiment in this fashion, we can check on the consistency      and re producibility of both the devices' effects and the      test methods.    </p>    <p>      Creosote accumulation is determined by weighing the "test      portions" of the chimneys before and after the test. These      sections consist of single-wall stovepipe located inside      the laboratory . . . where the controlled climate can give      better experimental control and reproducibility of results.      Using stovepipe instead of factory-built chimney increases      the amount of creosote that accumulates, since the flue      gases cool off more rapidly when passing through standard      stovepipe.    </p>    <p>      A variety of different wood species and moisture contents      are being used to fuel the stoves over the course of the      experiment, but the <em>same</em> species and moisture      content are used in all six heaters at any given fuel      loading. Furthermore, for each refueling, all six loads      have the same weight within 10%, and the total fuel weights      for each stove over a day are the same to within 1%.    </p>        <p>      The combustion air controls on all the appliances are set      to maintain the same burning conditions . . . using the      temperatures of the flue gases just below the devices and      the appearance of the fires as indicators of uniformity. As      shown in the diagram, flue gas temperatures are being      measured both below the devices and above them in the test      sections of the stovepipes. The temperatures are being      monitored constantly, using recorders.    </p>    <p>      The stoves will be fired for about ten days at a mixture of      high and low burn rates . . . in order to simulate home      stove use realistically and to assure that any creosote      reducer that performs better under particular firing      conditions gets a chance to show its capabilities. Each      stovepipe test section will then be reweighed. Both "wet"      and "dry" weights will be measured (the sections will be      placed in a 200°F oven for roughly three days before      the second weighing). From previous experience we know that      significant amounts of water can be trapped in the creosote      deposits on the flue walls, which could distort the results      if no dry weight were taken.    </p>    <p>      In our long history of testing stoves and accessory      products, we have encountered many surprises, and we've      learned to be careful about prejudging results. The      manufacturers of all three products claim significant      creosote-reducing effects . . . in our article in the next      issue of MOTHER, we'll report <em>our</em> conclusions,      after having actually put the products to the test.    </p>    <p>      Jay Shelton is the director of Shelton Energy Research, an      independent laboratory specializing in research, testing,      and product development in the area of wood and coal      heating.
