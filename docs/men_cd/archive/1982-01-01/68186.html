            <p>      Here are more tips to help you survive the most critical      time of the shepherd's year.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by Elora McKenzie</h5>         <p>      In Part I of "Living Through Lambing" (which appeared in      MOTHER NO. 72, p age 34), I discussed both the long- and      short-term preparations that sheep farmers need to make      before the lambing season gets underway. It's only when      those all-important weeks arrive, though, that the real      work of a shepherd's year starts.    </p>    <p>      As a ewe's delivery day nears, we begin to watch for the      unmistakable signs that'll tell us the animal is      approaching her due date. Most ewes "bag up" or "make a      sac"-that is, sport enlarged udders-and will      often "spring" (show a slightly swollen, pinkish vulva)      several days before lambing. (A protruding, reddish genital      area, however, can be a symptom of a serious problem . . .      usually a prolapsed vagina. See the accompanying sidebar      for information on treating that malady.)    </p>    <p>      Since it's not always possible to predict a birth by an      animal's size and shape, you'll need to look for other      tell-tale signs showing that a sheep is indeed "near her      time". At this point some shepherds like to confine the ewe      in a warm, dry lambing pen. Our system, however, is to make      frequent lamb checks around the barn or pasture . . .      searching for newborns with our ears as well as our eyes,      because a new mother will murmur distinctive sheep-love      sounds to her offspring. And it's always a good idea to      listen carefully before barging into a potential birthing      area (especially at night, when an unexpected flashlight      beam might scatter a family before you have a chance to tag      the new arrivals).    </p>                    <h3>      LABOR AND DELIVERY    </h3>    <p>      Many novice shepherds have asked us how long a ewe will      normally be actively in labor. Some experts say that      delivery ought to occur within half an hour after the onset      of contractions . . . while others insist that two hours      isn't excessive. Our experience runs the gamut between      those extremes: We've found that the time will vary,      depending upon such factors as the animal's weight and age,      the size of her baby, and her strength. Your best bet is to      rely on firsthand observation-rather than a      particular timetable-to determine whether a ewe is in      trouble or just having a long, but not dangerous, labor.    </p>    <p>      A normal presentation, in the birth of a lamb, will begin      with the appearance of the front legs, followed by the nose      . . . and then-once the shoulders pass through the      birth canal-the rest of the delivery will proceed      quickly and easily. Of course, lambs can emerge from their      mothers' wombs in a variety of positions, many of which may      require the attention of an experienced shepherd . . . or      even-in some cases-a veterinarian. For a handy      review of abnormal births, we consult our copy of an      article printed several years ago in <em>The Shepherd</em>      magazine. "Obstetrics in the Sheep Barn", which tells how      to deal with ten difficult delivery situations, can be      ordered-for $2.00 per reprint-from <em>The      Shepherd,</em> Dept. TMEN, Sheffield, Massachusetts 01257.    </p>    <p>      Once the fuzzy babe has arrived, a good ewe will clean the      veil of mucus covering the newborn's mouth (to enable it to      take its first breath) and lick it dry. However, some      mothers-particularly if they're young, inexperienced,      or just plain exhausted-may be slow to perform those      instinctive duties, so we occasionally have to lend a      helping hand. If all goes well, though, we like to give the      ewe and her infant an undisturbed half-hour immediately      following the birth . . . so they can get acquainted and      form a family bond. After this postpartum reverie, we swing      into the normal lambing routine that's really the heart of      our whole system.    </p>    <h3>      A TIGHT SCHEDULE    </h3>    <p>      It's often difficult to remember-while overwhelmed      with the euphoria of the first birth of the      season-how tired, irritable, and slightly befuddled      we'll become after a month or two of the intense activity.      So we've learned that the most effective lamb- and      temper-saver is a standard procedure that can be performed      by rote. Such a system should be worked out well <em>in      advance, so</em> that it can carry the burden of      performance when that inevitable battle fatigue sets in on      weary shepherds.    </p>    <p>      Here's the schedule we follow when handling a normal birth,      beginning soon after the lamb is dropped.    </p>    <p>      [1] Swab the umbilical cord with iodine.    </p>    <p>      [2] Tag the lamb and write down its number, sex, and      mother's number in the field record.    </p>    <p>      [3] Bag the lamb . . . that is, put on its LamDry raincoat.      (We do this even in pleasant weather, since we know that      the skies can turn threatening in a matter of minutes.)    </p>    <p>      [4] If the lamb is an only child, verify the ewe's milk      flow and leave mother and child alone in the field (or      wherever the birth occurred).    </p>    <p>      [5] If a ewe delivers twins, move the family into a      separate pen and <em>then</em> check the sheep's milk flow.    </p>    <p>      Finding out whether the animal's milk has started can be      tricky-especially if you're dealing with flighty      pasture ewes-but the job has to be done, since some      lambs will be too weak to dislodge the waxy plug that may      initially seal the orifice of the teat . . . and failure to      clear such a block can result in not only a swollen,      mastitis-afflicted udder, but possibly a starved lamb as      well.    </p>    <p>      The best method I've found to snag a suspicious mother is      to fool her into believing you're kidnapping her baby. I      kneel and hold the lamb where the ewe can see it, letting      her approach the bait and being careful not to look      directly at her. When she comes close enough, I grab her      front foot before she has a chance to retreat. I hang on      tight while getting my footing (and releasing the lamb),      then I grasp the ewe under the chin and stand up. That puts      her into as almost helpless position with her head pointing      skyward. Once she quiets down, I open her teats with a      gentle, downward squeeze-strip motion. (If a ewe is      particularly skittish, you can always restrain her with a      halter secured to a fence.)    </p>    <h3>      FORGING FAMILIES    </h3>    <p>      Newly arrived baby sheep need not only nourishment, but      also a great deal of maternal affection. Believe it or not,      a lamb-which isn't as resilient or aggressive as a      piglet or a calf-can die as a result of feeling      rejected! The problem is sometimes especially delicate when      multiple births occur. If a ewe has twins, the best way to      assure that Mom will accept the young'uns equally is to      isolate the new family by means of a temporary, portable      pen called a "hurdle".    </p>    <p>      To lure the sheep into that enclosure, I again use the      newborns as live bait: Holding a lamb under each arm, I      walk backwards toward the pen so that the ewe can see her      babies disappearing. Often the lambs will help by crying      pitifully to attract Mama's attention . . . but, if they      don't, I've learned to produce a fairly believable "meeeah"      myself (an F-sharp seems to work well). As long as the ewe      can see her lambs, she'll usually follow me straight into      the hurdle and then contentedly nuzzle the babes while I      lock the gate safely behind the group.    </p>    <p>      The amount of time the young family remains penned together      will depend upon what happens next. If after half a day,      for instance, I see that the group is closely knit . . .      that the twins are nursing well . . . and that their mother      obviously intends to care for them both, I turn them out      into an uncrowded location. On the other hand, if the ewe      seems to be favoring one of her lambs, I move that sibling      to a separate pen for several hours of enforced vacation,      to give the other newborn a chance at the chow line. It may      sometimes be necessary to assist the rejected lamb by      actually putting the nipple into its mouth, but      tube-feeding the little critter shouldn't be necessary      unless the mother completely refuses to cooperate.    </p>    <p>      When I'm sure that the formerly neglected lamb is being      nursed and loved, I return its twin to the hurdle . . .      confident that, after yet another short period of      undisturbed confinement, the ewe will ac cept them both.      Finally, once the babes have been with their mother for      three or four hours, we use the finger-in-mouth test on the      sleeping lambs to check their status: If a newborn has been      nursing, its mouth will be warm . . . while sick or      rejected animals-those that'll need to be      tube-fed-usually have cold or just lukewarm mouths.    </p>    <p>      Anytime the test reveals an unloved lamb, we milk the ewe      directly into a 60-cc syringe, fit the syringe with a 14"      to 16" small-bore catheter, and tube-feed the lamb with its      own mother's milk . . . following the procedure detailed in      Part I of this article, and being careful not to send the      liquid down the babe's windpipe. When obtaining the      life-giving fluid, I again rely on a halter . . . which is      an invaluable tool in such situations. I simply secure the      ewe's nose, fasten the line's free end to the hurdle, butt      the sheep's hip into the fence with my head, and go to      work!    </p>    <h3>      EMERGENCY CARE    </h3>    <p>      Even though we make frequent lamb checks, we sometimes      arrive at a delivery site too late to prevent what I call a      "flat lamb" . . . one of those little ones that's laid out      on its side, looking all too ready to pack it in. The      pitiable crea tures are suffering from either lack of food      and love or-in more serious cases-"white muscle      disease", which is a deficiency of vitamin E and selenium .      . . but we can often save them. Should a newborn have the      latter malady, an injection of those two nutrients, as      recommended in Part I, will revive the animal. (If, as some      breeders do, you've given the ewe herself such an injection      a few weeks prior to lambing, white muscle disease is not      likely in her offspring.)    </p>    <p>      A flat lamb that simply needs basic nourishment and      affection is usually so cold that its bodily functions will      have slowed to a snail's pace. I hustle it up to the house      and run a sinkful of water . . . not hot, but warm enough      to bring feeling into cold hands. Before immersing the      lamb, I tube-feed it with warm colostrum. Once the tiny      animal is submerged to its neck in warm water, I gently      flex its legs-moving them as if it were      running-to stimulate the circulation. As strange as      it may seem, it also helps to "baaa" at the lamb while      you're working with it. This deception seems to go a long      way toward reviving the sickly critter's spirit . . . and a      lamb will sometimes even weakly answer my call,      thinking-I suppose-that Mom really does care,      after all.    </p>    <p>      As soon as the youngster seems fairly well thawed, I take      it out of the bath . . . drip it dry for a moment . . . rub      it vigorously with an absorbent rag or towel . . . and then      cuddle it near the woodstove or fire for a while. After an      hour or two the revitalized creature will usually be      stronger and ready to be reunited with its mother.    </p>    <p>      Whenever the weather is foul (during rain, ice, and snow      storms . . . or simply in bitter cold temperatures), we      don't wait for lambs to go flat before pitching in.      Experience has taught us that hostile conditions often      cause a just-born sheep to draw up and huddle to keep warm      . . . and chances are that-in such cases-it      won't bother to nurse at all. We make it a habit to tube      every "bad weather" lamb that's born-without waiting      to find out whether it will get up to nurse-right      after we tag and bag it. We've found that an initial forced      feeding will usually give the animal enough energy to stay      warm and seek out its mother.    </p>    <h3>      ORPHANS    </h3>    <p>      Sometimes, in spite of all our encouragement, a ewe will      refuse to accept her lamb . . . perhaps because she favors      another baby, because she has udder problems, or because a      flat lamb has been revived too late to fit into her closely      defined circle of affection. Some people call the rejects      pet lambs, but other shepherds-including      us-refer to them as bummers. Sure, they're cute when      they follow you everywhere, but the toddlers are also real      nuisances to any busy farmer!    </p>    <p>      When we began sheep raising, we used to keep all the      rejects in our flock . . . but after a season or two, we      realized that the special feeding schedule required by the      orphans was simply too time-consuming and expensive. You      must begin by giving such an animal 60 cc of milk four to      five times a day, and gradually increase to 120-cc helpings      by the end of the first week. Or the orphan can simply be      fed every three hours during the first week of life and      then every six hours thereafter . . . until it's about a      month old and able to survive on three daily feedings.      After its initial two meals of colostrum, an abandoned baby      can dine on lamb replacer and "creep feed" . . . which is      nourishment that's placed in a trough accessible only to      the small animals. It's possible to coax the youngsters to      accept creep feed by sprinkling lamb replacer over the      rations and forcing a little bit into their mouths.    </p>    <p>      Some shepherds-in an effort to save time and      trouble-like to train their orphan lambs to eat from      automatic nursing setups, but we haven't found such devices      as helpful as they first seemed. Training the tiny,      starving animals is no easy task . . . and the milk      containers require a lot of attention, since they must be      kept clean and free of bacteria and be filled at set      intervals.    </p>    <p>      Our present strategy is to keep orphans only as long as      needed to replace stillborn lambs. (We tube-feed rather      than bottle-feed them until they're adopted, because a      dependency on the artifi cial nipple shape may make the      animal reluctant to accept a foster mother's natural teat.)      If we find they're not needed for that purpose, we sell the      motherless babes, at whatever price we can get, to folks      looking for pets.    </p>    <h3>      ADOPTION BY GRAFTING    </h3>    <p>      Before putting an abandoned lamb on the market, however, we      always attempt to have the orphan adopted by a ewe that has      lost her own offspring. Shepherds commonly use one of      several "grafting" methods to encourage a bereaved mother      to accept a substitute. The only foolproof technique we      know of is called hide-grafting, which incorporates another      procedure known as slime-grafting. The combined practice      entails confining the ewe in a hurdle, then skinning her      dead lamb (the sooner after its death the better) . . . and      dressing an orphan in that jacketlike covering so the      mother will assume it to be her own.    </p>    <p>      To remove the dead lamb's skin, I use a sharp knife to make      a linear slit up the belly . . . then a ring slit around      each leg above the knee joint, and another around the neck      to meet the belly cut. Next, with one hand I pull the skin      to one side of the center opening and run my other hand      along the length of the body between the skin and the      carcass to free the membranes. I follow the same procedure      on the other side of the carcass, sometimes using a knife      to cut through membranous layers. Then I work the      blade-or one finger-down through and around      each leg hole and, finally, cut through the tailbone at its      base, leaving the tail attached to the skin (and being      careful to retain any fetal dung, since that's the first      place a ewe checks for the scent of her own newborn).    </p>    <p>      I fit this rather grisly coat over the back of the      prospective adoptee . . . rubbing its head with the hide as      I do so, in order to grind the smell in. I take some of the      placenta from the dead lamb's birth-if I can find      it-and rub that, too, all over the orphan. (This last      step is slime-grafting, which some shepherds use alone . .      . preferring it to the messy, unpleasant task of skinning a      dead lamb.)    </p>    <p>      In order to complete the ruse, we often have to tie two of      the orphan's legs together-especially if it's already      a frisky two- or three-day-old-so that it will struggle to      get up and convince the ewe that it is indeed a newborn      babe. (After all, if I allowed a foster lamb to make a      beeline for the teat as soon as I placed it with the      tentative mother, she'd know full well she hadn't just      hatched such a lusty child!) I generally remove the      legbinding after about 30 minutes, and watch the      relationship bloom from there. Of course, we always keep a      record of the adoption, including the reason for the      natural lamb's demise. If there's no acceptable      justification for it, we usually cull the ewe at the end of      the season. If you prefer, you can have a vet perform an      autopsy on the dead newborn. (In some states this service      is available free of charge.)    </p>    <p>      When a lamb dies and no graft is available, we have to dry      up the ewe, especially if she's a heavy milker. To do so,      we milk her out once . . . keep her penned with low-quality      hay and no water for 36 hours . . . then milk her out again      and give her along, satisfying drink. One more round of      this procedure should get the drying-up process off to a      good enough start to make her udder flaccid and prevent the      formation of hard spots-or mastitis-in the bag.      And to be sure the ewe dries up completely, we keep her off      lush pasture until we see her bag diminish.    </p>    <h3>      DOCKING AND CASTRATION    </h3>    <p>      Once a shepherd has safely delivered the season's crop of      lambs and knows that they're all well cared for, he or she      may be tempted to heave a sigh of relief and head for the      house. Unfortunately, two of the more unpleasant tasks      associated with sheep raising are yet to be done. Docking      and castration may seem pretty diabolical, but there's      sound reasoning behind these practices.    </p>    <p>      Docking is the process of cutting tails on three-day-old      lambs so that the mature sheep will be free of a long,      woolly appendage that would collect manure and attract      flies. Tailed sheep are prone to flystrike, a hideous      infestation in which fly eggs are laid in the dirty wool      and later hatch to release maggots, which feed on the      living flesh of the unfortunate animal. Docking also makes      shearing easier, and some folks claim that tailless ewes      breed more readily.    </p>    <p>      As I mentioned in Part I, we've come to prefer-after      plenty of experimentation with various      methods-docking by burdizzo and knife. The lamb is      held across the shepherd's knee, rear end forward. Then the      skin of the tail is moved up toward the lamb's body while      the burdizzo is clamped in place . . . positioned to leave      enough of a stump so the animal can later swish away flies.      A sharp knifecleaned with a mild antiseptic solution such      as Zephiran-is used to cut the tail off inside the      instrument's jaws. The burdizzo is then left in place for a      full minute, and when it's removed, the skin that was      pushed forward will spring back to help seal the wound.    </p>    <p>      There are two good reasons to castrate young rams. First,      the males mature so quickly that-if left      untouched-they can sometimes breed before they're      even weaned . . . a most untimely and undesirable event!      Just as significant is the animal's carcass development.      The masculine ram frame favors the growth of less expensive      cuts of meat (those in the shoulder and neck areas) ...      whereas the wether, or castrated ram, develops more      valuable meaty hindquarters and loins. We believe that      castration by knife alone is the most humane method      available (the accompanying photos illustrate this      technique).    </p>    <p>      In summary, lambing season is an extremely busy time of      year, even for the owner of a small flock . . . so it pays      to be prepared for whatever problems may arise.      Fortunately, emergencies are the exception rather than the      rule. Most ewes have no difficulty with delivery, claim all      their offspring, and generally give their masters      little-if any-grief.    </p>    <h3>      FIRST AID FOR PROBLEM EWES    </h3>    <p>      One of the unhappiest sights a shepherd can see-as he      or she surveys a flock of nicely fattening      mothers-to-be-is a red, bulbous protrusion decorating      the rear of his prettiest ewe. The animal will appear to be      hunched over, straining to relieve her condition. But,      although vaginal prolapse looks alarming, it can usually be      treated on the spot . . . often without the help of a      veterinarian.    </p>    <p>      Many circumstances can cause this condition, but here's      what usually happens: Toward the end of pregnancy, the      increased level of estrogen in the mother sheep's blood (in      preparation for lambing) and-in some cases-an      inherent muscle weakness cause the birth canal and all its      supporting musculature to relax. Well, some ewes just "let      down" a little too much, and the whole shebang falls out!      The best approach is to deal with the situation immediately      after discovery, and proceed as follows:    </p>    <p>      [1] Keep on hand a supply of "Ewe Bearing Retainers", which      will allow you to replace the prolapse. These flat plastic      tongues with handles on either side are available from      sheep supply houses. [EDITOR'S NOTE: See Part 1, in the      previous issue of this magazine, for the addresses of such      companies. Turn to page 120 for back issue ordering      information.)    </p>    <p>      [2] Secure the ewe, using a halter, in a clean, dry area .      . . just in case she should take a notion to lie down      during the restoration process. You might also find it      helpful to elevate her hindquarters by propping a bale of      hay under her.    </p>    <p>      [3] Wash the protruding muscles and the retainer thoroughly      with Zephiran or another antiseptic.    </p>    <p>      [4] If the prolapse is minor, you can insert the retainer      directly . . . holding the prolapse in position and placing      the holder above your hand, so the paddle pushes up against      the cervix. (Every package of retainers contains      illustrated instructions.) The handles of the device are      then tied firmly to clumps of wool on both flanks of the      sheep. The ewe will be able to lamb normally past the      retainer.    </p>    <p>      [5] If the prolapse is too large to be manipulated into the      animal's body, you may have to shrink it -a bit. Oldtimers      swear by a method that we, too, have found to be quite      effective. Coat the prolapse with sugar, and then wait for      it to draw up enough to fit back inside. It may take more      than one application of sugar-and several hours of      waiting-but the technique does sometimes prove successful.    </p>    <p>      [6] Give the ewe a shot of antibiotic as insurance against      infection.    </p>    <p>      Once her vagina is replaced, the animal will stop straining      and-more than likely-have a normal delivery.      Note the sheep's prolapse on her record, however, so she      can be culled at the end of the season (since the problem      would otherwise likely occur again) . . . and don't keep      any of her lambs for breeding, because the tendency to      prolapse is thought to be an inherited characteristic.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: A year's subscription to The Shepherd      magazine is available for $9.50 by writing to the address      given in this article.    </p>

This castration technique draws little blood, except for a small flow from the tiny capillaries of the ram's scrotum
