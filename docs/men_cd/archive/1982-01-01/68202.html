        <p>Sometimes winter's weather leaves children little choice but to busy themselves indoors. Here's a way to make a stay-at-home plaything that's amusing and instructive as well.</p><p>When your youngsters are forced to stay inside-either by subzero temperatures that make outdoor play a "minutes at a time" venture, or by unseasonably warm days that leave every snowsuit in the house soaked before noon-the old homestead can get to feeling pretty danged small. However, this simple project (which could be used to teach a few shop skills to the children) will produce a toy that'll keep the most restless tads enthusiastically occupied.</p><p>Of course, some people don't cotton to firearms themselves, and-understandably-don't want their children to have toys that simulate such weapons. But if you're one of the many who do keep a gun or two around the house, you probably know that it's never too early to teach your youngsters to respect such tools and to treat them safely. This little rubber-band rifle can go a long way toward instilling good, safe shooting habits at an early age. And when Mom and Dad see how much fun their offspring are having-knocking down paper cups or making balloons dance along the floor-chances are the big folks will be eager to get into the games themselves!</p>
