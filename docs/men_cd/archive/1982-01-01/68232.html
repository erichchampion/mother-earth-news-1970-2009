            <p>      Distract and delight your friends and family on the long,      cold winter's night with...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by 		Larry Herbert    </h5>    <p>      When the days are short and the nights are cold, evenings      at home all too often seem to consist of little more than      stoking the fire in the old woodburner. And although the      warmth of the flames provides physical comfort, you may      well find yourself craving a bit of mental stimulation as      you while away the hours indoors.    </p>    <p>      The little brainteaser shown here is simple to assemble,      requires only common tools and materials, and is guaranteed      to provide both challenge (when <em>you</em> try to figure      out how to separate the heart- shaped piece from the other)      and pleasure (when your <em>victims</em> attempt to solve      the puzzle while you smugly watch)!    </p>        <p>      <strong>A TWIST HERE, A TURN THERE</strong>    </p>    <p>      To create your own brain-boggier, gather together three or      four wire coat hangers, a couple of pairs of stout pliers,      and a cylinder-a socket from a wrench set, for      example-about one inch in diameter.    </p>    <p>      Cut the coat hangers and bend and assemble them as      indicated in Figs. A and B below. Form the loops around      whatever cylindrical object you've selected to use for that      purpose, and create the heart- shaped piece by any method      you choose. (I just use my hand as a pattern . . . shaping      the wire around my fingers.) I recommend that you lightly      weld, epoxy, wire, or tape both the loops and the heart      piece closed ... to strengthen the toy <em>and</em> to      discourage cheating.    </p>    <p>      I've gotten a great deal of pleasure from making these      no-cost bafflers for my friends and family ... and in      almost 20 years I've never seen anything else like them. Go      ahead and take a crack at solving the puzzle, and      then-if all else fails-see the accompanying      sidebar for the solution!    </p>    <p>      Caution! Read this only as a last resort!    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Simple (?) Solution</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're scanning over these words, you're no doubt so      frustrated and perplexed by this mind-bender that you've      got a pair of wire snippers on stand-by. Well, try to      stifle the urge to resort to such ignoble force, because      the system's not impossible to beat!    </p>    <p>      First off, look at Figs. A and B to identify the parts of      the puzzle so you'll understand the directions (left-handed      persons will want to move Loops 1, 2, and 3 to the left      side of the drawing, and Loop 4 to the right side, and      continue from there).    </p>    <p>      Begin by grasping the heart of the puzzle at Point B with      one hand, and the main part at Loop 4 with the other. Now,      place Point A through Loop 1 .. . slide Loop 3 down through      Point A ... and work Point A so that it's "inboard" of Loop      2. Then push Point A through Loop 2 and over Loop 3. Move      the heart-shaped piece straight "inboard", and your puzzle      should look like Fig. C.    </p>    <p>      To complete the maneuver, put Point A through Loop 2, then      put Loop 3 through Point A and push "inboard" . . . you're      home free!    </p>    <p>      You can return the heart to its original position by      working the solution backwards. Doing so is a tad easier      said than done, but some practice (and patience) should see      you through.    </p>
