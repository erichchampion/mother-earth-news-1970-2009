                <h5 id="byline">      by ANNE AND PAUL EHRLICH    </h5>		    <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to the      words "population", "resources", and "environment" in the      late 1960's. (They also coined the term coevolution, and      did a lot to make ecology the household word it is today.)      But while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular      writing in the areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of      us-for instance-have read Paul's book The      Population Bomb) . . . far too few people have any idea      ofhow deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological      research (research of the type that tends to be published      only in technical journals and college textbooks). That's      why it pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRAZIL: HOPE AND HORROR</strong></p><p>      Among the highlights of our field trip to South America      last year were the three weeks we spent in Brazil: the      largest nation, in area, on that continent and the fifth      largest in the world. Brazil is a "less developed" land . .      . but, unlike many such countries, its future doesn't seem      hopeless. In spite of its huge size (greater than the total      of the U.S.'s "lower 48"), Brazil has only some 120 million      people, and is rich in geographical and biological      diversity and natural resources. There's little question      that this nation <em>could</em> solve its problems before      population growth and social and environmental      deterioration convert it into a permanent "basket case".      However, whether or not it <em>will</em> do so remains to      be seen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SAD JUXTAPOSITION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Rio de Janeiro, which was our first stop, can be seen as a      microcosmic model of Brazil's main problem: "two-tiered"      development. Rio is in the most beautiful setting of any      large city we know . . . exceeding in loveliness even our      own San Francisco. The metropolis is built between the      coastal mountains and the sea, and-since the      mountains drop almost directly into the water-the      city is very narrow, clinging to lower slopes, beaches, and      landfills.<br />      The <em>cariocas</em> , as the residents call themselves,      are rightly proud of their gleaming white, world-famous      beaches lined with equally white and gleaming apartment      buildings and hotels. (Some of the beach-front condominiums      are actually worth over a million dollars!) But back from      the beach, sometimes only a few hundred yards, the other      Brazil can be found. On the hillsides,      squatters-often immigrants from the desolate      Northeast-have created large, crowded slums known as      <em>favelas.<br /></em> Because of the city's physical      setting, this juxtaposition of great wealth and great      poverty-characteristic of the world as a      whole-may be more obvious in Rio than anywhere else .      . . and it shows clearly in the metropolitan crime      statistics. More than a million muggings and armed      robberies annually have created what our Brazilian friends      described as "panic" among residents.<br />      <br />      According to the <em>Jornal do Comercio,</em> more than      400,000 people in Rio-out of an area population of perhaps      7.5 million- <em>have been robbed more than      once.</em> Many such crimes are committed by juveniles, who      are both difficult to catch and nearly immune to punishment      under Brazilian law . . . a situation similar to that found      in such North American cities as New York.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>A LOS ANGELICIZED DETROIT</strong>    </p>    <p>      In contrast to Rio, which is a commercial center,      São Paulo-the epitome of the Brazilian economy's      upper tier-is an immense industrial city with about 14      million people in its metropolitan area. The state of      São Paulo, of which the city is the capital, is the      major revenue producer for the entire nation, and many      Paulistas frankly view their city and state as a developed      nation embedded in an underdeveloped one.<br />      <br />      São Paulo has heavy smog, many world-class      restaurants, first-rate newspapers, and relatively few      slums. Its sprawling development gives the impression of a      Los Angelicized Detroit. The road between it and Rio, more      than 200 miles to the northeast, is often a      bumper-to-bumper jam of heavy trucks, because the nation      has neglected its rail system and is now paying the      price.<br />      <br />      There's excellent agricultural land in Brazil, particularly      in the South. In Paraná, we drove for hundreds of      miles through rich farmland-much of it planted in      soybeans, some in wheatwhich reminded us of the North      American prairies. Brazil is clearly in a position to feed      itself, but still imports food for economic/organizational      reasons: Sugar cane (for alcohol-fuel production) and      soybeans have been so extensively planted as cash crops      that wheat and even black beans the staple protein food of      the Brazilian poor-must now be imported. (Lately,      black beans have <em>quadrupled</em> in price, and the      nutritional state of the underprivileged has suffered      because of it.)<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>AHOPELESS MIGRATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      In fact, the poor-that sad lower tier of the Brazilian      economy-are simply being left behind in the nation's      rush toward "development". And their plight is probably      worst in the drought-stricken Northeast . . . the      bulging "hump" of Brazil centering on the city of      Recife.<br />      In that region a combination of overpopulation, ecological      destruction, and a feudal social system has produced a      sickening level of poverty. This situation has resulted in      large-scale migrations to the more prosperous South in      general and to São Paulo in particular. Hundreds of      thousands of individuals move to that city each year . . .      but many leave again, unable to tolerate the relatively      cold winters or-with their minimal      skills-unable to earn enough to feed      themselves.<br />      <br />      This migration <em>within</em> Brazil can be viewed as one      more manifestation of the global trend of people moving      from poor to rich countries (see "Immigration in the      Future", MOTHER NO. 61, page 150), since the two tiers of      Brazilian society are nearly as economically disparate as      are, for instance, Mexico and the United States.<br />      <br />      Adding to the problem is Brazil's seeming inability to      control population growth, to improve the distribution of      wealth, or to protect the nation's fragile environment.      Although the most recent census shows a small decline in      the growth rate, Brazil's demographic situation remains      grim, with the population projected to reach about 200      million by the turn of the century.<br />      <br />      Health Minister Waldyr Arcoverde recently announced (over      the opposition of the Roman Catholic Church) that 1981      would be "the year family planning comes to Brazil to      stay", but there is, as yet, no sign of a serious program      of fertility control similar to that which was recently      launched in Mexico. Indeed, economist Herman Daly, who has      done much research in Brazil, recently wrote us that the      population debate there "has hardly progressed at all in 12      years". As the country becomes more urbanized, a decline in      the fertility rate can be expected (since that's been the      case in most developing nations), but certainly not fast      enough to prevent problems of overpopulation from worsening      enormously.<br />      <br />      It takes at least a decade for a good family planning      program to become well established in a large country, and      even the most effective of such undertakings must contend      with the inertia of population growth. Brazil will be      fortunate if it can halt growth before its population      reaches 250 million, and it's clear that even concerted      efforts to achieve a reasonable distribution of      wealth- <em>if</em> they're initiated-will take      a long time to have a substantial effect.<br />      <br />      The problem of overpopulation is, of course, intertwined      with problems of social justice and environmental      protection. For example, if the Northeast had a more      equitable social system and the region had not suffered      great environmental degradation from deforestation,      northeasterners might have shared the sort of prosperity      that has come to São Paulo, and the area's birth      rate would undoubtedly have been lower. In turn, migration      pressures would also have eased, and ill-advised schemes of      Amazonian "development" (in part, the result of attempts to      resettle northeasterners) could have been avoided.<br />      <br />      But the problems of the Northeast, like those of many other      poverty-stricken parts of the world, are not only rooted in      history, but perpetuated by an unwillingness of people in      wealthy areas and countries to face up to changes and      sacrifices that must be made if the poor are to achieve a      reasonable standard of living.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ECOLOGICAL CONCERNS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Ecologists, of course, are especially concerned over the      fate of the rain forest of Amazonia (see "Hope for the      Tropical Forests?", MOTHER NO. 53, page 110). This region      is the world's single greatest reservoir of organic      diversity and is crucially important to the present and      future welfare of <em>Homo</em> <em>sapiens</em> (see      "Extinction: It Should Concern Us All!", issue 88, page 154      and "The Economics of Extinction", No. 89, page 144).<br />      On the hopeful side, vast stretches of the Amazon Basin      still remain essentially untouched by modern society, but      substantial areas <em>are</em> being deforested . . . very      often for the most temporary of gains. For instance, we      visited a region north of Manaus where a rain forest,      growing on very poor soil, was being cleared. In a short      time the bare soil will turn into pure sand and become      essentially worthless for growing crops . . . and will      likely be unable even to support grazing animals. The      project is one result of an unfortunate set of tax laws      designed to encourage the "development" of the Manaus area.      Large corporations, operating out of southern Brazil, are      thus able to protect profits made elsewhere by carrying out      unprofitable, and destructive, schemes in the rain      forest.<br />      <br />      Bad laws contribute to environmental destruction elsewhere      in the country, as well. A regulation of INCRA (the      National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform)      that was initially designed to help break up huge estates (      <em>latifúndios</em> ) has had the effect of      discouraging farmers from leaving any of their land in      forest or woodlots.<br />      Furthermore, regulations that are supposed to protect both      natural areas and indigenous peoples tend to be poorly      enforced by weak agencies. Most of the subtropical forests      of Paraná have been cut down to make way for      soybeans and other crops. Included in the deforestation was      a large part of the Iguassú Falls State Park, which      somehow got converted to farmland.<br />      <br />      Although Brazil has-on paper-an impressive      system of national parks and reserves, there's a severe      lack of money to protect them. And corruption, powerful      local interests opposed to preservation, and public apathy      work against the system. As a result, intrusions and      disruptions are common in some protected areas now, and the      future fate of many may be similar to that already suffered      by a portion of the Iguassu park.<br />      <br />      The government is also shortsightedly encouraging the      chopping down of virgin forests to get wood for use as      industrial fuel. A Brazilian journalist described his      nation's development policy this way: "If you can't eat it.      . . burn it down."    </p>    <p>      <strong>NATIVE MASSACRES</strong>    </p>    <p>      FUNAI (the Brazilian National Indian Foundation) seems to      have as little power to protect the land's native people as      other government agencies have to protect its forests.      While we were in the country, news broke of six Xavante      Indians being killed, and more than 50 made sick, by      arsenic dumped into the Couto Magalhaes River by estate      owners who wanted to exterminate the inhabitants of the      Parabubure reservation.<br />      <br />      This was not the first time that the Xavantes had been      massacred in that area of the state of Mato Grosso. In      1952, almost all the women, children, and elderly who      remained in Xavante villages were killed by men from local      estates (including the <em>latifúndio</em>      responsible for the recent atrocity), and by 1980 the      Indians were completely driven from the area by continuing      attacks . . . which included biological warfare waged by      distributing flu-virus-contaminated objects! Apparently,      the most recent killings occurred because estate owners      couldn't reconcile themselves to the creation of the      reservation . . . which, by presidential decree, absorbed      some 325 square miles of estates and brought the Indians      back.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THERE'S STILL A CHANCE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Brazil's "hope" now lies in its still-reasonable balance      between resources and population . . . the presence of a      strong industrial base . . . and the diversity and vitality      of its people. Although the country is relatively short of      oil, producing less than 20% of its petroleum needs, Brazil      has immense hydroelectric ca pacity. It has also, as most      MOTHER readers well know, pioneered in the use of both      gasohol and ethanol to power its automobiles (which are      manufactured locally).<br />      <br />      The government has attempted to curtail gasoline      consumption and reduce enormous oil import bills by      prohibiting the sale of petroleum-based motor fuels on      weekends. This has caused some resentment, because the      method chosen is viewed as less than ideal . . . because      there seems to be more than enough petroleum available at      the moment . . . and because there's suspicion that      Petrobras, the government oil company, may be fraudulently      enriching itself through price manipulations. In addition,      using either gasohol or alcohol fuel (which can be bought      on weekends) sometimes creates maintenance problems,      including carburetor and manifold corrosion and engine oil      contamination and dilution.<br />      <br />      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Two members of MOTHER's staff visited      Brazil last year and investigated this and other aspects of      utilizing the alternative fuel. It seems that corrosion and      contamination have been a problem only when the conversion      of gasoline-powered vehicles to alcohol fuel use was      performed by untrained mechanics. Factory-made ethanol      burners, on the other hand, have had few problems, and most      of those have been attributed to the use of excessively      watered-down alcohol by car owners wishing to stretch their      fuel supplies.]</em> Brazil has some coal (unfortunately      with a high sulfur content) and an abundance of nonfuel      mineral resources, including the world's largest single      deposit of iron ore. And the country certainly has adequate      human resources for development . . . ranging from skilled      farmers (many of Japanese descent) to first-rate      scientists. The latter may be a mixed blessing, however . .      . one young physicist told us that the Brazilian military      had approached him to join a laser research group whose aim      was to develop devices for separating uranium 235 from      U-238, the crucial step in the manufacture of atomic      bombs.<br />      <br />      We were also told repeatedly that Brazilian President Joao      Batista Figueriredo is in favor of protecting the nation's      biological resources . . .      but-unfortunately-multinational corporations,      Brazilian big-money interests, and corruption continue to      work against him.<br />      <br />      It's unarguable, however, that Brazil's fate will be      determined over the next decade or so, as its residual      pronatalism and the current push for hog-wild development      come in conflict with a growing environmental awareness. If      the nation moves toward ecological sanity, it could easily      become one of the great powers of the future. If it      doesn't, it will follow the India/Bangladesh route. And if      the flora and fauna of the Amazon are destroyed in the      course of Brazil's deterioration, the impact on global      ecosystems could be catastrophic.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      Information on the Xavante massacre is from Folha de      São Paulo, November 23, 1980.
