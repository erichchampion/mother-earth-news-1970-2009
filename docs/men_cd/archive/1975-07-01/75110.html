                    <h5 id="byline">      by Aimee Gelwick    </h5>    <p>      Like most of MOTHER's readers, you're probably into doing      things on your own. Some skills, though, are just too      complex and specialized to be realistic propositions for      the lay person and most likely you'd expect surveying to be      one of them. Not at all! A mastery of the basic techniques      is within your reach, and can save you time, money, and      labor on your land.    </p>        <p>      Perhaps you haven't yet found your homestead and in that      case your first real life encounter with surveying may      occur when you size up a tract for possible purchase. If      there's no survey on record or none that describes the      plot's boundaries in detail you can't be sure, for example,      whether that desirable stream is on "your" place or the      adjoining property. Only actual measurement of the acreage      you're considering, on the basis of the description in the      deed, will show exactly what you're being offered. (See      Chapter 8 of Les Scher's Finding and Buying Your Place in      the Country for an attorney's view of this subject. If the      exact course of a property line makes a crucial difference      to the value of a tract you desire, you%I probably want a      professional survey but your own preliminary work should at      least help you decide whether or not you want to continue      negotiations MOTHER.)    </p>    <p>      In some states, land transactions are lawful only if a      survey recent enough to be considered legally binding is on      file with the county recorder. You may not be allowed to      carry out this work yourself, since many jurisdictions      recognize only licensed surveyors' reports for official      purposes. A phone call or letter to the nearest Government      Land Office will tell you whether or not this is true in      your case. Even if it is, however, an authorized      professional's signature on your field notes will sometimes      be accepted. Talk to your area surveyor's office about this      possibility.    </p>    <p>      If you're interested only in surveying inside your property      line, of course, the joy of mapping your kingdom is yours      without hassle. And it is a joy. An examination of your      tract with rented or borrowed instruments could be your      first step toward a new relationship with the land the true      understanding of all its rills and byways that comes only      from close inspection. In addition, your findings will help      you lay out your homestead sensibly and give you accurate      information on which to base decisions about building,      gardening, farming, landscaping, etc., projects of all      kinds.    </p>    <p>      Precise land surveys depend on three fundamentals:<br />      <br />      [1] the determination of distances,<br />      [2] the determination of elevation, and<br />      [3] the measurement of angles. Which of the three      operations you perform first or at all depends on the      particular surveying problem at hand. In the following      sections I'll describe all three fundamentals of surveying      as they might be carried out on the homestead. The more      complex instruments needed for such work can be borrowed or      rented from colleges, state agriculture departments, or      blueprint companies (which supply professional surveyors).      Other items can be bought inexpensively or improvised at      home.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCE</strong>    </p>        <p>      To determine distances accurately when fencing, for      example, or laying out garden lots of equal area you'll      need the following equipment:    </p>    <p>      [1] A set of 11 chaining pins. These can be made from coat      hanger wire (see Fig. 1).<br />      [2] A 100 foot steel or metallic woven tape. George      Washington did his surveying with a chain probably, a 66      foot Gunter's chain, like the one shown in Fig. 2 and the      modern version (Fig. 3) is, accordingly, called a steel      chaining tape. You might substitute 100 feet of rope marked      off in feet, with the first foot divided into tenths. Be      precise!<br />      [3] Two range poles (any. stick about seven feet long will      do).<br />      [4] A plumb bob on a string (Fig. 3).<br />      [5] Pencil and field notebook (found at college bookstores      and blueprint companies) to record your notes. As an      alternative, use two pieces of lined paper prepared as      shown in Fig. 4 (both pages have about 25 lines). The first      page should be headed with a legal description of the land      to be surveyed, and its six columns used to record      numerical data such as distances between points, elevations      from range pole readings, and angles turned between points      on the transit. The top of the second page bears the names      of the persons doing the surveying, the date, and a note on      the weather. The rest of the sheet is used for      illustration. A sketch map should be included to give an      aerial view of the tract, with arrows indicating north and      south and labels showing points, fences, roads, and other      features.    </p>        <p>      Pencil which won't smear, as wet ink does is best used to      record your notes in case of rain when you're out in the      field.    </p>    <p>      Let's suppose you want to fence part of your acreage maybe      section off the back 400 feet for a small cow pasture (in      which case your problem is to mark off a line parallel to      and 400 feet away from the rear boundary of the property).      Or, if your land holding is more extensive, you might want      to lay out an area 400 X 7,600 feet. In either situation,      the main objective is to measure off a specified distance      from a known corner point or points.    </p>    <p>      Place a range pole at the corner from which you want to      begin, and set the other pole at an approximation of the      desired distance (to help keep you heading in the right      direction as you work).    </p>    <p>      Next, recruit the assistance of your Mate or a friend, and      open the tape between you to its full length. The person      holding the Zero end is head chainman (H.C.). His partner      the surveyor in charge of the 700 foot end is rear chainman      (R.C.).    </p>        <p>      The H.C. marks the starting point with a chaining pin, arms      himself with the other 10 pins and walks toward the next      corner of the area to be measured, while the R.C. makes      sure his companion takes a straight path toward the range      pole (see Fig. 5). When the tape is stretched to its entire      length, the R.C. holds the 100 foot point exactly on the      corner pin and pulls against his partner until the measure      is straight. At that point the R.C: yells, "Stick!" and the      H.C. pokes one of his chaining pins into the ground at      exactly zero (Fig. 6).. The pair once again checks to be      sure the tape is tightly stretched between them, then      repeats the whole procedure until the entire distance from      (the old, known) corner to (the newly determined) corner      has been covered. (After 1,000 feet there should be no pins      left which is a good way to double check against loss of      markers.)    </p>    <p>      When you place your pins in the ground, incidentally, it's      test to insert them at an angle so that the tape can then      be held directly over their points of entry. Use chalk      instead of chaining pins to mark pavement or other hard      surfaces.    </p>    <p>      Measurement between two trees, boundaries, or other points      won't give you such nice round numbers to work with which      is where the first foot of tape and its smaller divisions      come in. Let's say the distance involved is about 56 feet.      Place a pin at the 50foot point, then use the first 6 feet      of the tape to determine the remainder. This gives you a      figure accurate to tenths of a foot: 56.3 feet, for      example. For very accurate work, remeasure the distance      you've just stepped off by starting from the finish point      and then working "in reverse" back to your original      landmark corner. Record your findings on the first page of      your field notes and illustrate them with a diagram on the      second sheet.    </p>        <p>      You'll need to use a plumb bob to help you determine      distances accurately in hilly areas. The device is      suspended by a string wrapped around one of the foot      markers on the chain. if, for example, you must measure      downhill, the H.C. will hold out the tape as level as      possible above the ground and set the pin at the spot      marked by the point of the plumb bob. (See Fig. 7.) For      really steep slopes, you may have to break your chaining      length down to about five feet at a time.    </p>    <p>      You cap also measure distances by counting steps when great      accuracy isn't necessary. First, though, you must carry out      a pacing test on a course of known length. Mark off 100      feet or more with a steel tape or rope (as described in      this section), walk from one end of the line to the other,      and record the number of steps you took. Do this about four      times, add the totals, and divide by four for an average      pace factor. This figure is a useful aid in 'making rough      estimates of distance when you begin a measurement of      elevation or angle.    </p>    <p>      <em>NOTE: This is the first half of a two part article. The      second half to be run in MOTHER NO. 35 will explain, among      other things, how to measure elevations and angles.</em>    </p>
