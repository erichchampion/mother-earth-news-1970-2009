                    <h5 id="byline">      by George Beekman    </h5>        <p>      The country dweller has to be many things: a bit of a      doctor, a bit of a plumber, a bit of all those other      specialists who handle' emergencies for city folk. Well, I      can't give you a Red Cross first aid course, and I      certainly can't offer you police protection but there is      one type of mishap which I might be able to help you deal      with: wildfire.    </p>    <p>      While three years of fighting fires with the U.S. Forest      Service hardly makes me an expert, the experience has given      me the basic knowledge I need to deal with most types of      rural or backwoods blazes and I'll try to pass on enough of      what I've learned so that you'll know what to do if flames      spring up on your property. If you live more than a few      minutes from a fire station, the information might come in      handy someday.    </p>    <p>      No, this isn't going to be the same talk the fire chief      gave your class back in fourth grade. If you don't already      know how to store oily rags, gas cans, and matches safely,      I'm sure your rural fire department will be glad to advise      you and they're also the people to call if smoke is pouring      from one of your buildings and you don't have a chemical      extinguisher. I'm here to tell you how to understand and      control a brush, grass, or timber fire before the flames      spread to the house.    </p>    <p>      The first rule of fire fighting is the simplest, the most      important, and the most often ignored: DON'T DO ANYTHING      FOOLISH! Wildfire can be an unpredictable, even deadly      animal. Keep thinking all the time!.    </p>        <p>      OK, let's get down to specifics. What do you do if you      discover a brush fire in the woodlot or a patch of grass      ablaze in the meadow? First, size up the      situation-quickly-by asking yourself the following      questions:    </p>    <p>      [1] How big is the fire? If it's more than a few feet      across, you should probably get help.    </p>    <p>      [2] How fast is it spreading? Air temperature, humidity,      wind speed, type and density of fuel, slope of the land,      and nearness to barriers such as roads and streams will all      affect the rate of advance. On hot days, large wildfires in      certain types of brush have been known to climb hills at      speeds up to 40 miles per hour and unless you can run that      fast, the answer to this question is of critical      importance.    </p>    <p>      [3] What tools are available? A shovel is nearly always      essential for most fire fighting, but anything that will      move dirt can be substituted in a pinch. If timber is      burning, you'll need an axe or the like. And a supply of      water, along with a bucket or a pump and hose to transport      it, can save a lot of work.    </p>    <p>      [4] Will I need help'? Use the answers to the first three      questions as bases for this decision. When in doubt,      respond "Yes". In fact, you should always get assistance if      you can do so without abandoning a spreading blaze for a      long time.    </p>    <p>      If you can contact the fire department, do the men there      know more than you about fire fighting. But if you can't      reach professional help, or already have and are waiting      for aid to arrive, what's next?.    </p>    <p>      As long as you're in charge of the situation, you're faced      with two top priorities: to cool off "hot spots" and to      contain the blaze within a fireline.    </p>    <p>      [1] Knock down hot spots. A hot spot is any part of the      fire that's exceptionally hot: a flaming bush, a glowing      stump, or a rapidly burning anything. If such troublemakers      are more than a few feet in from the, edge of the blazing      area, don't worry about them at the outset. But if you find      any near the perimeter, you'll need to cool them as quickly      as possible first, because they give off sparks and heat      that spread a fire, and second, because you want to lower      the temperature enough to let you get in close and dig a      fireline.    </p>    <p>      Water is good for quelling hot spots, but a well aimed      shovel full of dirt can do wonders, too. Blazing grass can      usually be flattened, by slapping it, with a shovel, a wet      broom, or a soaked burlap bag. Remember, you don't have      time at this point to worry about putting the offenders      dead out you're just trying to cool them down.    </p>    <p>      [2] Dig a line around the fire. Your next job is,      essentially, to starve the advancing monster by removing      fuel from its path. This means using your shovel, hoe,      rake, or anything that's available to scrape a clear space      all the way around the fire. Dig right down to mineral soil      to create a bare are a couple of feet wide and completely      free of anything burnable. Be careful as you work not to      knock any flaming material outside the line, or you'll have      to dig a whole new one later. In case the fire is near a      ready made barrier such as a road or stream, you can anchor      the new line to the existing boundary. You'll want to keep      your cleared path as close to the burning area as possible,      though, to contain the advancing menace as tightly as      possible. If the flames are spreading rapidly in one      direction, get the line in on that side first. A blaze      that's really moving probably can't be checked if you have      only a shovel to work with but a tractor with a digging      attachment might be able to do the job fast enough.    </p>    <p>      Once you've gouged out the initial line around the fire,      take time to clean up the barrier. Use an axe or saw to cut      away all branches that overhang the cleared space and every      root that passes under it. (Yes, fire can travel      underground through a root system.) Also, make sure that      the area a few feet on either side of the dug out path is      clear of all branches, bushes, and other potential fuel.      Throw any singed or partially burned matter in toward the      center of the fire. Anything completely untouched by flame      can be tossed well outside the line.    </p>        <p>      OK, the fire is contained and the hot spots are cooled. The      worst of the emergency is over but don't leave the scene      yet, or you'll likely be digging a new line tomorrow or      next week. You still have a lot of dirty work ahead of you.    </p>    <p>      [3] Mop-up. Here's where you make sure the whole fire is      dead out. Water is especially handy at this stage, but it's      not enough. If the blaze was at all intense, it probably      left some hot areas underground that could smoulder for      weeks and then flare up again and you can't depend on water      to wipe out such danger spots. You'll have to turn over the      soil inside the line to be sure you've caught them. The      Forest Service uses shovels for this purpose, but a tractor      might be a help in a timberless location.    </p>    <p>      Mop-up also involves separating and scattering any bits of      fuel that remain inside the line. Don't leave piles of half      consumed debris either spread the material or burn it      completely.    </p>    <p>      When you're satisfied that everything within the line is      out cold, and that there are no spot fires outside the area      (be sure to check the whole vicinity for a goodly distance      in all directions sparks can really travel), declare      yourself a hero and take a rest.    </p>    <p>      [4] Check up. Don't forget where the blaze was, because      you'll have to check the spot carefully at least once a day      for the next few days. You'd be surprised how many dead      fires return from the grave.    </p>        <p>      Remember throughout the whole process DON'T DO ANYTHING      FOOLISH! By most rational value systems, your life is more      important than your property and fighting fire can be a      risky business, especially for the inexperienced. Here are      some rules to supplement your own common sense;    </p>    <p>      [1] Don't tackle more than you can handle. Call on your      neighbors and the fire department for help and extra tools.    </p>    <p>      [2] Let the most experienced or knowledgeable person in the      group take charge. Too many chiefs can be dangerous as well      as inefficient.    </p>    <p>      [3] don't work too close together. Allow 10 feet between      fire fighters. Axes, shovels, and chain saws can be as      dangerous as flames.    </p>    <p>      [4] Watch out for the safety of everybody near you. Look up      as well as around, and don't let anyone work under a      burning tree or snag.    </p>    <p>      [5] Always have an escape route in mind. You can't outrun a      fire if it surrounds you.    </p>    <p>      [6], Be humble around fires there's a lot you don't know.      Still, what I've told you in this article should help in an      emergency. May you never have to use the information!.    </p>
