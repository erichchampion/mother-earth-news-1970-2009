                    <h5 id="byline">      by Clarice L. Moon    </h5>    <p>      I've saved flower and vegetable seed from my garden for      many years and every summer, as the tomatoes redden on the      vines and the bean pods plump out, I look forward to the      satisfying ritual that hands the qualities of my best      plants on from year to year.    </p>        <p>      I find this seed-keeping project rewarding for several      reasons. First, of course, it's a big help in the money      department. Now that commercial seeds are priced at 354 to      754 per packet, my budget is healthier because I can sow at      least part of my plot without a trip to the garden supply      store. Second, the garden is healthier too since each      successive crop is descended from plants that flourished      right here on my place, and the offspring of those vigorous      specimens are especially well suited to my particular      growing conditions. Third, it's also,good to know that part      of my seed-which assures me of food for the future can      double as extra rations during the winter months. (Potatoes      are always potatoes, whether you put them in the ground or      in the cooking pot.) And to tell the truth, even if my      hobby didn't offer the above practical benefits, I'd go      ahead with it anyway just for, fourth, the fun of it all.    </p>    <p>      My seed gathering project, of course, began with an      original supply of plants which I grew from store-bought      seed "way back when". If you decide to follow this example,      purchase your stock from a reliable firm and take care to      pick the most suitable varieties (standards, not hybrids)      for your purpose and locality. When the vegetables are well      grown, select the best specimens of each and let them      mature instead of using them for food. (Mark the chosen      individuals in some way by tying strings to them, for      instance so that they won't be harvested by mistake.)    </p>    <p>      How long the seed will take to form varies from one crop to      another and depends especially on whether the plants need      one season or two for full development. The ,former group      the annuals-includes such garden favorites as beans, peas,      radishes, mustard, lettuce, spinach, corn, cantaloupes,      pumpkins, squash, cucumbers, eggplant, peppers, and      tomatoes. The seed of all these annuals is easily      collected.    </p>    <p>      Any radishes you leave in the ground, for instance, will      send up tall stalks with flowering tops that attract      honeybees. Later on, seed pods will form, ripen, and dry.    </p>    <p>      Harvest the pods by breaking them off the stalks, and then      shake them as a test for dryness. Any that don't rattle      should be hung (out of the hot sun) for further drying.      Those that have reached the rattling stage can be opened      and their contents placed in a saucer to dispel any      remaining moisture. The seeds can then be packed in an      envelope. Seal the container, mark it with the name of the      vegetable and the date, and file it in a dry place until      the following season.    </p>    <p>      Lettuce and spinach, if not picked at the leaf stage, will      "bolt" that is, send up stalks from which the fully matured      tops can later be cut. You probably won't need to leave a      whole row of either plant for seed production, but it's      better to have too much than too little.    </p>    <p>      Beans and peas to be saved for seed (or soup) are allowed      to remain on the vine until thoroughly dry. The plants can      then be pulled and the dry pods picked.    </p>    <p>      One easy method of shelling legumes is to put the pods in a      tightly woven cloth bag, lay the sack on the floor, and      walk on it to break open the seed containers (or just dump      the harvest into a tub and tramp on it). Then pour the      mixture of beans and pods from one large pan to another in      a moderate wind to blow away the debris. The cleaned seed      can be stored in bags in a dry place.    </p>    <p>      Another popular group of annuals-the vine crops-are easily      cross pollinated by insects and must not be planted near      one another if you want predictable results in the next      generation. This need for separation is the only problem      you're likely to find with cucumbers, cantaloupes,      pumpkins, and squash since the seeds themselves are large      and easily collected from the ripe fruit. (Make sure      cucumbers really are ripe. They'll let you know by turning      a golden color.) When such a fruit or vegetable is ready,      simply cut it in half and scrape the contents of the cavity      into a wooden or porcelain container (never use tin or      iron). Add some water and let the mixture ferment a day or      two to separate the seeds from the mucilaginous material.      Then pour in more liquid and stir the mess. The good seed      will sink to the bottom, while the pulp and immature seed      float on top. Pour off the waste and wash the solids with      fresh water until only the desired product remains to be      dried and stored in bags in a moisture-free place.    </p>    <p>      Other fleshy crops can be treated in the same way. just be      sure such vegetables are thoroughly ripe before picking.      Peppers, for instance, ought to be red and rather soft,      while eggplant should be left on the bush as long as      possible until its seeds are brown-and gathered just before      frost.    </p>    <p>      Tomatoes come in many varieties red, pink, and yellow,      large and small. If you raise hybrids, don't attempt to      save their seed (which is infertile). Stick to the      standards for that purpose, and remember to leave your      chosen specimens on the vine until they're overripe for      table use. just one or two tomatoes might furnish enough      offspring to stock a small garden, and can be handled in      the same manner as squash and cucumbers. If you want larger      amounts of seed, cut a number of fruit in half and squeeze      the insides into a wooden or earthenware receptacle. Or,      for real mass production, just toss the whole tomatoes into      a barrel and crush them with the square end of a wooden      post (gently, so as not to injure the seed). Then add water      and proceed with the fermentation process described above.    </p>    <p>      Corn (sweet, field, and pop) must also be chosen from      standard varieties, not hybrids, if seed is to be saved.      The ears should be left on the stalk until they're rather      dry, and then picked and stored in an airy place to      dehydrate still more.    </p>    <p>      Potato plants grow from the eyes of tubers formed the      previous year and kept in cool storage over the winter.      Since one potato may have more potential sprouts than are      needed for a single hill, it can be cut into two, three, or      more pieces as long as there are several good eyes on each      chunk. The segments are allowed to stand a couple of days      until the fresh surfaces darken and partially dry. This      process of "healing over" is necessary because a newly cut      potato tends to rot in the ground instead of growing.    </p>    <p>      Some folks just skip the business of cutting seed potatoes,      plant the whole tuber regardless of how many eyes it has,      and still get a good yield. Like many gardening practices,      this seems to be a matter of preference.    </p>    <p>      All the crops I've discussed so far are annuals and seed      collection procedures are quite different for biennials,      which don't mature until their second year. This group      includes cabbage, carrots, beets, parsnips, rutabagas,      turnips, and parsley.    </p>    <p>      To obtain carrot seed, for example, select good-sized roots      within the fall and break or twist off the tops (leaving      about half an inch of stem so that the crown of the      vegetable won't be injured). Store the carrots in the      earth, covered deeply enough to prevent freezing. In the      spring, set the roots in rows-just as they grew originally,      with the crown of each one level with the surface of the      ground-and leave them until seed stalks form and the seeds      ripen.    </p>    <p>      Carrot seeds are produced in brown clusters at the end of      the stalk's branches, and ripen unevenly. As each bunch      darkens and dries, it can be cut with scissors and laid on      a sheet to dehydrate further. The seed can then be rubbed      out of the clusters by hand and the rough material and      chaff removed by raking. Final cleaning can be done by      winnowing (dropping the vegetation from a height of five or      six feet in the open-over a piece of canvas or sheeting      when a light wind is blowing). The heavy seed will fall on      the ground cover while the breeze carries away the light      chaff. Next year's sowing is then stored in paper or cloth      bags, in a room of uniform temperature.    </p>    <p>      The principle is the same for other biennials: First season      roots or plants are kept in cool storage over the winter,      replanted the following spring, and allowed to mature and      bear seed.    </p>    <p>      One blessing of home-grown seed is that you can save all      you want far more than you could afford to buy. In the case      of some crops, there's no such thing as "too much" because      any surplus you may have is useful as food. Extra corn can      be ground in a mill for use in many delicious cornmeal      dishes, and you can't beat snowy mounds of popcorn for      winter evening nibbling. Dried navy beans are another good      cold-weather dish (and are worth raising just for that      purpose if you have garden space). Pumpkins, squash, and      sunflower seeds can be salted and roasted for a nutritious      snack: And everyone has a favorite use for the overflow      from the seed potato bin.    </p>    <p>      You can also save flower seeds, as an economy and for the      interest of studying the varied forms of propagation. Old      fashioned poppies, for instance, bear seed vessels that      look like tiny cups with little holes around their upper      rims. The containers are designed to tip out the seed when      the wind blows the stalk but you can do the tipping      yourself, and catch the contents in an envelope.    </p>    <p>      Petunias produce tiny seeds in small pods which can be      picked, dried, and opened. The hard, black "pebbles" that      will someday be morning glories are also borne in pods. In      zinnias, however, the seed is formed at the base of the      petals and the whole flower head is gathered and dried.      Even geraniums grown outdoors in summer will yield the      makings of future plants.    </p>    <p>      Whatever seeds you save should be dated, and used      (preferably) the following ,year. The power to germinate      decreases rapidly with age, and-while keeping times differ      in various crop solder seeds generally don't perform as      well as fresh.    </p>    <p>      It's important to remember that no seed-whatever its      origin-will germinate 100 percent. Fifty percent is a more      realistic expectation. Even the packets you order from      leading suppliers will contain a number of duds, and you      should allow for such failures by planting each row of your      garden rather thickly. If you must thin later, the extras      can be discarded or transplanted to a fresh space.    </p>    <p>      The fact is that seeds-like other living things-won't      always behave just as you expect. Nevertheless, a program      like mine is well worth the trouble and can eventually give      you a good supply of reliable strains that thrive in your      garden's special conditions. I hope you'll enjoy this      fascinating activity as much as I have and continue to do!.    </p>
