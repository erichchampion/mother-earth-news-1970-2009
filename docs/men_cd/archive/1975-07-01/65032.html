                    <h5 id="byline">      by James Richards and Richard Wendland    </h5>    <p>      [ More Pictures Here ]    </p>    <p>      Here in Oregon, hated hay is now selling for between $50.00      and $90.00 a ton, If prices are similar in your area, maybe      you've looked into the possibility of raising your own and      given up when you found that balers, tractors, rakes, wind      rowers, etc, cost a small fortune, But what if you learned      that you could put up a ton of bated hay a day or even just      half a ton with no outlay other than the expense of a      barrel? Well, you can!    </p>        <p>      First, it's important to realize that many fields of grass      which go uncut because of the high cost of conventional      haymaking could be harvested by less expensive methods A      tractor mower is great if you can get the use of one, but      if not, a small meadow can be cut by hand (and raked in the      same way).    </p>    <p>      You may not even have to do any cutting. In this state, the      highway department owns a large amount of land in the form      of right of-ways some of which may never be used. The      tracts are mowed regularly each year and then just left      alone and, with proper permission, the grass is yours for      the raking. Be careful, however, not to gather hay that has      been sprayed, or grown by the side of a really heavily      traveled road (motor vehicle exhausts do contain lead, you      know). Incidentally, straw left after the harvest of grass      seed or grain may also be collected and baled by simple      methods.    </p>    <p>      Amateur haying can be quite effective. One of us, in fact,      made a ton of hay in a single long working day just by hand      raking cured grass and packing it in a homemade gadget that      cost practically nothing and operated very well,    </p>    <p>      Actually, the idea of a "stationary baler" isn't new many      farms formerly had such devices. Although we've never seen      one of the old-time models, we understand that the machine      was basically a large, cubical mold into which cured hay      was piled. A horse was then walked in a circle to raise a      weight that, when tripped, dropped to compact the fodder.      The advantage of this system over loose storage was slim if      there was any at all. The invention we're about to describe      is a much smaller unit, intended for use by those who want      to put up modest amounts of hay but have no access to      standard equipment.    </p>    <p>      The basis for our love-cost baler is a 55-gallon drum,      modified as follows:    </p>    <p>      [1] Remove one end of the barrel, [2] Cut the container      down the middle in half lengthwise to form two equal,      semi-cylindrical halves. [3] Weld two hinges, appropriately      spaced, to one of the long seams, [4] Welt! two sets of      tabs (cut from scrap angle iron) to the edges of the other      seam, so that the two sides of the opening are equipped      with facing surfaces which can lie clamped together, You'll      also need an X-shaped configuration of wood or metal, with      a hook or bent nail at each extremity. This device should      just fit into the bottom of the container.    </p>    <p>      To prepare the baler for operation, close the drum and      secure the edges of the two halves with clamps screwed to      the tabs. Cut two lengths of baling twine no      substitutes!.and drape them down in the barrel so that they      cross each other at right angles with their center sections      held by the hooks at the bottom of the barrel and their      free ends hanging over the drum's wall. The ends of the      strings are then fastened loosely to a band of twine      running around the outside of the barrel, to keep them from      falling down inside the container and being lost when the.      hay is added.    </p>    <p>      OK, you're all set to make a lame. Just pack the barrel      with loose hay, stomp on the fodder to compact it, and tie      each length of twine with a "trucker's hitch": Loop one end      of the string, pass the other through the loop, cinch up,      and secure the fastening with a double half hitch. Then      remove the clamps, open the barrel, and take out your      product. You'll find a bundle weighing 50 to 70 pounds not      as neat or compact as those formed by the conventional      baler, but still a functional, easily stored unit. Yep,      this rather primitive method really works and the price of      the equipment is hard to beat.    </p>
