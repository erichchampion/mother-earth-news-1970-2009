                    <h5 id="byline">      by Terry Grossman    </h5>    <p>      Hay is basically dried vegetation: usually a legume such as      alfalfa or clover, or a grass such as timothy or brome.      It's one crop that can be raised with proper care in any      part of the country where weeds will grow, and it's a must      for any self-sufficient farmer who keeps livestock.    </p>		<p>The choice of plant (or plants) to be grown for hay    depends on many factors: climate, availability of water,    tonnage needed, type of livestock being fed, etc. Local    preferences are usually a good guide. (A detailed study of    the characteristics and requirements of forage crops is found    in The Stockman's Handbook by M.E. Ensminger, available for    $27.25 from The Interstate, Danville, Illinois, or from    MOTHERS Bookshelf.MOTH ER.)</p>    <p>      Whatever hay crop you choose can be grown either as part of      a farm rotation plan or in a permanent meadow. The former      system has the advantage of helping establish uniform soil      fertility (particularly if one of the legumes is raised).      The latter, however, provides stubble for winter pasture,      helps to control erosion, and is particularly suitable for      marginal land.    </p>    <p>      A plot of earth is prepared for forage crops in much the      same manner as for most field and vegetable plantings      except that if you're reseeding an old hayfield, you may      omit plowing and merely disc the area. Soil tests should be      made before seed is sown to determine any deficiencies and      manure, lime, compost, ground rock, etc., spread as      required. Hay has been grown for thousands of years without      chemical fertilizers, and there's no need for them today.      In fact, organically raised fodder is better for livestock      and is less susceptible to insect infestation (which is      quite rare on healthy soil).    </p>    <p>      Hayseed is planted like grain: spread either by hand (in      the classic manner of a farm wife scattering chicken feed)      or with a hand-cranked broadcaster available at low cost      (around here, about $10.00-MOTHER.) from many hardware      stores and seed houses.    </p>    <p>      A more uniform stand of hay is created by a grain drill      (Fig. 1) a machine which is pulled by a team or tractor and      plants the seeds in evenly spaced rows. You may be able to      borrow a drill from a neighbor, or (here in Colorado, at      least) you can hire a custom operator to do the work for a      small charge per acre.    </p>    <p>      In that case the cereal is harvested at the end of the      first season, while the hay is generally left uncut until      the following year.    </p>    <p>      If irrigation is normally required to grow vegetables in      your area, you'll find it profitable to give your hayfield      the same treatment. In semi-arid regions like ours (with an      average precipitation of 14 inches a year), artificially      watered stands yield three to four times as much fodder as      their parched counterparts. (Alfalfa, for example, requires      831 pounds of water to produce one pound of dried hay.)    </p>    <p>      Most hayfields will flourish for five years or more without      reseeding. The only care necessary during that time is the      spreading of fertilizers as needed and a periodic      harvesting of the crop. One possible exception: Your      locality could suffer an infestation of aphids or locusts      some season with disastrous results. Whether or not you      spray under such conditions is a matter of conscience. If      you choose not to do so, you can reduce your losses      substantially by cutting the hay immediately upon attack      and drying and storing it fast enough to save it from total      annihilation.    </p>    <p>      Even in a normal year, when you're not racing a horde of      hungry pests, the timing of the hay harvest is very      important. The reason for this is that as the forage crop's      blossoms develop, its energy goes into producing seed and      its nutritional value begins to decrease. Legumes should      therefore be cut at 10 to 20 percent of full flower for      maximum protein and vitamin content. Grass hay is usually      put up a little later by the calendar (just when depends on      the climate of your area), but still during early bloom.    </p>    <p>      Three steps are involved in turning a green crop into what      can rightfully be called hay:    </p>    <p>      [1] cutting (followed by partial drying), [2] windrowing      (followed by further drying), and [3] baling or stacking.      Just how you go about these operations depends on the      amount of the harvest and the availability of money,      equipment, and manpower.    </p>    <p>      In days of yore, hay was cut with a scythe and windrowed      and stacked with a fork (all by hand). Unless very small      amounts (two acres or less) of the animal feed are being      put up or unless one is very thoroughly hung up on the      romantic tradition this method is now impractical. (Someone      who's good with a scythe really ought to write an article      on the subject. I've tried my hand with the old time tool      and rate its proper use as an art.)    </p>        <p>      Nowadays, most hay cutting is done with a mechanical mower      powered by a tractor or horse. True, the tractor-driven      model is two or three times faster but you can buy its      old-fashioned counterpart for almost nothing (after all,      who uses horses anymore?) and you'll find it quite      efficient. The mower shown in Fig. 2 cuts a seven foot      swath and ought to be able to handle one acre per hour.      (Incidentally, if horses or mules aren't available, such      equipment can be pulled by a tractor running at very low      speed.)    </p>    <p>      Freshly cut hay is allowed to dry (pray for clear weather!)      for anywhere from a half day to three days after it's      mowed. It's then windrowed, or raked into rows. The tool      commonly    </p>    <p>      used for this purpose is the so called side delivery rake      (Fig. 3), an ingenious horse- or tractor-drawn device which      sweeps the stalks into neat columns with leaves turned      inward and stems outward (to promote uniform drying).    </p>    <p>      The raking operation goes quite fast once you get the hang      of it. It's a bit tricky, though, since two mowed swaths      must usually be thrown together to form one windrow of      suitable size for field curing. A steady hand on reins or      steering wheel is required and slip-ups will probably bring      some ridicule from neighboring farmers who derive      considerable amusement from amateur efforts (as I learned      during my first summer).    </p>    <p>      The windrowed hay is next allowed to dry until most of its      moisture has evaporated. One simple test for dryness is to      twist stalks taken at random and examine them for internal      dampness. Another is to put some wisps in a small box along      with a couple of teaspoons or so of salt. Shake the      container vigorously for about one minute. If the salt      remains dry, the hay is ready to store.    </p>    <p>      Baling or stacking wet hay is not only economically foolish      since the fodder may mold or rot, and no livestock will eat      it in that state but downright dangerous. Moisture in the      stack can lead to spontaneous combustion a lesson many a      farmer has learned by the light of his burning barn.    </p>    <p>      "Make hay while the sun shines" is the traditional rule.      Nevertheless, a passing rain on the hayfield isn't quite as      serious as it's often made out to be. just wait a day or so      after the shower until the surface of the cut fodder has      dried. Then make another run through the fields with the      side-delivery rake to turn the windrows over so that their      bottoms can dry. If you're lucky, very little of the fine,      choice leaves and other tender foliage will "shatter" and      fall off. An extended wet spell, however, is another matter      a misfortune that can ruin a harvest. Keep tabs on the      weather reports during haying, and-as noted, if you're so      disposed pray.    </p>    <p>      Dried hay may be stored in stacks or in bales. The easiest      way to gather the fodder for stacking is to have someone      drive a truck or pull a trailer between windrows while      several helpers fork on the harvest. If you lay ropes on      the empty bed of the vehicle and loop them over the top of      the finished heap, unloading will be a simple matter of      tying the ends of the cords to some stationary object such      as a tree and driving away.    </p>        <p>      Haystacks should be built to look like haystacks and if you      don't know what I mean, you might do well to spend an      afternoon in an art museum, with particular attention to      the room that houses the Dutch masters. The larger the      stack the better, because big piles have a smaller ratio of      surface area to volume and soon pack down thus preventing      rain from seeping in and ruining the hay.    </p>    <p>      To offset its lack of Old World flavor (which only the most      discerning of livestock will notice) baled hay has the      advantages of being easier to handle, requiring less time      and labor to put up, and taking less storage space. The      chief drawback here, however, is that you'll need a baler-a      small factory in itself-which is often expensive both to      buy and to maintain. (Beware of "bargains" we bought a      twine tie baler, used, for $200 and put many gray hairs on      our heads as a result.)    </p>    <p>      Unless you're putting up enough dried foliage say 15 to 20      acres to justify the purchase of a good used baler, I'd      suggest that you either stack your hay or hire a custom      operator to do the baling for you. A check on local rates      may very well show that the service is less expensive than      ownership of the necessary equipment.    </p>    <p>      A closing note that may be of special interest to communes      and other groups: In most of this country's rural areas,      it's possible to pick up some extra money during the summer      by "bucking" hay (taking bales from the field and building      them into a neat pile or putting them up in a barn's loft).      You'll generally be paid at a fixed rate of so many  cents      per bale in the western half of the country and so much per      hour back east. We've found that a bucking crew of a female      driver and three men can handle an average of 500 bales a      day.    </p>    <p>      Before you start calling me a sexist, by the way, please      consider that every one of these solid blocks of fodder      weighs about 75 pounds. I well remember the day when one of      our woman members decided to help buck while the rest of us      took turns driving. She ended the afternoon in tears of      exhaustion. It's that kind of work which is why most      farmers are more than willing to pay somebody else to do it      for them. Before you commit yourself to bucking 10,000      bales, though, try working at the job on a trial basis for      a day or two first just to make sure you want the money as      much as you'll have to labor to get it.    </p>
