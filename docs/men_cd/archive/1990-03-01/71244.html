                    <p>      <strong>The Soul of Gardening</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>To define it is as hard as catching a butterfly on the      wing. But some people have tried.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by PAT STONE    </h5>    <p>      <strong>PART ONE</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Taken from a great new quarterly, GreenPrints, which      provides the "inspiration that goes with the perspiration."      Available for $10 per year, from GreenPrints, P.O. Box      1355, Fairview, NC 28730.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOMETHING</strong>more than food and flowers pulls      us out into the garden each spring.    </p>    <p>      Something less tangible, yet all the more real. What could      it be? The chance to touch nature? An excuse to play in the      dirt? The annual opportunity to study the language of life?      A feeling of faith, or perhaps one of prayer?    </p>    <p>      The more you try to examine the why of gardening, to pin      down its wings and peer at its glittery markings, the more      quickly it flutters just out of reach. Finally, you realize      that there is no "soul of gardening," no one part like a      thorax or an antenna you can hold in your hand. The very      concept is forever multiple and elusive.    </p>    <p>      And just then, when you give up all hope of rational      analysis, you also realize how fulfilling and fun the chase      itself is. Indeed, when you quit trying to get one answer,      you begin to fully enjoy all of them-and all the      mental meanderings they entail.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps no season stirs the gardening soul to expression      more than spring, after the opportunity to putter with      plants has lain low for months, locked in winter inertia.    </p>    <p>      Charles Dudley Warner put it this way some 120 years      ago:<br />      "The love of dirt is among the earliest of passions, as it      is the latest. Mud-pies gratify one of our first and best      instincts. So long as we are dirty, we are pure. Fondness      for the ground comes back to a man after he has run the      round of pleasure and business, eaten dirt, and sown      wild-oats, drifted about the world, and taken the wind of      all its moods. The love of digging in the ground is as sure      to come back to him as he is sure, at last, to go under the      ground, and stay there."    </p>    <p>      Such joy belongs not just to our ancestors. When Bobby      Fountain, a young Texan training to be a paralegal, was      stuck recently writing an essay for his English class, he      found these words bursting out:    </p>    <p>      "The first of February, my blood perks up like a coffeepot      brewing, because, down here in Texas, February 14 is 'Tater      Time.' The garden to me is a place to relax. You win      whether you profit or not.    </p>    <p>      "When you begin to prepare the ground, you feel a weird,      relaxing transfer of power. You see dirt loosening and      mixing. You see worms and frogs emerging, feeling the      warmth of spring. You smell fresh air and new-turned      ground, new grass and new budding trees. When I see frogs      breaking ground, I stop and watch. Whether it sounds crazy      or not, I name them. This is mine, the place where I relax      and communicate with God. I can feel it."    </p>    <p>      Still, not all images of spring ground breaking are      soothing. Last year, I found that the roar of my Rototiller      spurred less-sanguine thoughts, and I put them down:    </p>    <p>      “I keep tilling parallel lines, joyful and intent on      the ribbon of soft, dark earth. But every one in a while,      the noise intrudes and reminds me that-let's be      honest-I'm chain-sawing the soil. Running a      two-wheeled Cuisi-nart through the sleeping, brown earth. I      wrestle the tiller through a tight 180° turn, flinging      myself around in a half circle, and start down the next      row. My thoughts take a new turn too.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>A garden restores the body to      usefulness-a victory for our species.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      "Gardening is not a natural activity. Gather wild nuts and      berries, forage feral fruits of the earth, if you want to      be Joe (or Jo) Back-to-Nature. But don't tell me that      osterizing the earth into brown marbles, yanking out every      plant that wants to sprout in the soil, and then inserting      the foliage you choose where you choose is a natural      activity.    </p>    <p>      "The machine and I sputter to a halt. I gaze over the plot,      envisaging its future, and my spring-inebriated self cries,      'It is too a natural activity.' Soon these chocolate rows      of earth will nurture little seedlings that tug chords of      protectiveness in my heart. Soon the sodden brown soil will      turn green with life, a green flecked with yellow, blue,      red, orange, pink, white. I kneel down and palm some of the      prepared earth. It's dark, rich, loose. Five years ago,      when I started this garden, it was pale, lean, slick. Cover      crops and compost, fertilizer and time have turned this      clay into loam. I, human, have intervened, but my efforts      have steered this garden's life, made it better. Earth in      hand, mind on soil, the relationship becomes clear.      Gardening is an interface, a connecting portal. I tell the      life I sow what I want it to do. It replies by what it does      and doesn't. I listen to those answers, devise a response,      and try again. With this dialogue, I delve into the      language of another species, any, another phylum, trying to      translate what it tells me, to serve it better so it can      better serve me."    </p>    <p>      Contemporary rural essayist, farmer, and poet Wendell Berry      is an advocate of the work value of gardening:    </p>    <p>      "One of the most important resources that a garden makes      available for use is the gardener's own body. At a time      when the national economy is largely based on buying and      selling substitutes for common bodily energies and      functions, a garden restores the body to its      usefulness-a victory for our species. It may take a      bit of effort to realize that perhaps the most      characteristic modem 'achievement' is the obsolescence of      the human body. Jogging and other forms of artificial      exercise do not restore the usefulness of the body, but are      simply ways of assenting to its uselessness; the body is a      diverting pet, like one's Chihuahua, and must be taken out      for air and exercise. A garden gives the body the dignity      of working in its own support. It is a way of rejoining the      human race."    </p>    <p>      Finally, there is T'ao Yung-Ming. Back in the fifth century      A.D., he quit his job as magistrate because he no longer      wanted to "crook the hinges of his knee" bowing to      superiors. He retired to spend the last "bright hours" of      life in his garden:    </p>    <p>      "And now I take my pleasure in my garden. There is a gate,      but it is rarely opened. I lean on my staff as I wander      about or sit down to rest. I raise my head and contemplate      the lovely scene. Clouds rise, unwillingly, from the bottom      of the hills; the weary bird seeks its nest again. Shadows      vanish, but still I linger around my lonely pine. Home once      more! I'll have no friendships to distract me hence. The      times are out of joint for me, and what have I to seek from      men? In the pure enjoyment of the family circle I will pass      my days cheering my idle hours with lute and book. My      husbandmen will tell me when the springtime is nigh, and      when there will be work in the furrowed fields. Thither I      will repair by cart or boat, through the deep gorge, over      the dizzy cliff, trees bursting merrily into leaf, the      streamlet swelling from its tiny source. Glad is this      renewal of life in due season; but for me, I rejoice that      my journey is over. Ah.! How short a time it is that we are      here! Why then not set our hearts at rest, ceasing to      trouble whether we remain or go? What boots it to wear out      the soul with anxious thoughts? I want not wealth; I want      not power; heaven is beyond my hopes. Then let me stroll      through the bright hours as they pass, in my garden, among      my flowers; or I will mount the hill and sing my song, or      weave my verse beside the limpid brook. Thus will I work      out my allotted span, content with the appointments of      Fate, my spirit free from care."<br />    </p>
