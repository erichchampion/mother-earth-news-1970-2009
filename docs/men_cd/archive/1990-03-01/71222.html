                <p><strong>      [OVER AT THE VET'S]</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>We've bred some pets into toothaches.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Randy Kidd, D.V.M.    </h5>        <p>      <em><strong>A small dog's life isn't what it's cracked up      to be, what with dental appointments and all.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It may prove of only passing interest to the cosmos,      hut good dental care ought to play an integral role in any      whole-body health program-whether for people or their      pets. Yet veterinary dental experts</em> tell us that fully      85% of all pets over six years of age have periodontal      disease.    </p>    <p>      That's sad. Animals have a tough time enjoying life with      less-than-healthy teeth. And tooth problems often lead to      serious infections that are extremely difficult to treat,      sometimes even becoming life threatening.    </p>    <p>      Keeping a dog or cat's mouth and teeth healthy may be a bit      of a challenge, but it's vital to an animal's well-being.    </p>    <h3>Genetics and Teeth</h3>    <p>      In some breeds, tooth problems begin at birth. A mini-size      pooch that can curl up comfortably on your lap is mighty      cute, but if you look at that lapdog's mouth you'll      probably find a disaster. When mankind manipulated genetics      to develop tiny dog breeds, it managed to decrease the      animals' body size but failed to achieve a corresponding      decrease in the size and number of teeth. Growing teeth      have to go somewhere, and when crammed into a half-size      mouth they often rotate sideways or poke in or stick out. A      mouthful of ragged and jagged teeth isn't much good for      chewing and, worse, is full of gaps that serve as hideaways      for food particles that cause gum, bone, and tooth disease.    </p>    <p>      Larger breeds with scrunched-in faces also commonly inherit      congenital dental problems. Pooch's pug nose may make it      more appealing in the pet shop window, but its flattened      face is jam-packed with teeth meant to fit into a      substantially longer snout.    </p>    <p>      If you're choosing a pup and would rather have one that      isn't an instant dental catastrophe, pick a dog that looks      caninelike. The more a dog's snout looks like that of a      wolf, fox, or coyote, the less our genetic tampering has      altered its mouth's structure. If you can hold the dog in      the palm of your hand, or if its face looks like it ran      full steam into a brick wall, you can pretty much assume      the dog is a dental bill waiting to happen.    </p>    <h3>Toothbrush Training</h3>    <p>      The time to begin taking care of a pup or kitten's teeth is      shortly after it arrives in your household. Brushing is as      essential to preventing dental disease in pets as it is in      humans. So the sooner the animal gets accustomed to having      a toothbrush in its mouth, the better. Here's how to go      about it.    </p>    <p>      1. Make it a game. Pick a time of the day when it'll always      be easy for you to take a few minutes out to play with your      puppy or kitten. Then, while you're playing, make it a      point to rub the animal's teeth and gums with your fingers.      Make sure that your pet associates these initial      "brushings" with fun and games. By doing this regularly, at      the same time and in the same place every day or so, the      pet will gradually learn when it's time to play (and have      its teeth rubbed).    </p>    <p>      2. When the young pet becomes accustomed to the mouth play,      add another element: Dampen a cloth, wrap it around your      finger, and use it to rub its teeth. For kittens, try using      a cloth dampened in the juice from a can of tuna or      sardines. A pup might like a garlic-dampened cloth better.    </p>    <p>      3. Graduate to a toothbrush when the pet seems ready to      accept one. Use a soft baby toothbrush or one made      especially for pets. There are also finger cots available      that have an abrasive surface especially made for rubbing      teeth. Exactly what kind of "tooth brusher" you use is not      nearly as important as it is that you use it consistently.      For that matter, you can continue to use a piece of cloth      wrapped over your finger.    </p>    <p>      In any case, don't use human-variety toothpaste. Our pastes      are intended to be spit out and will make a pet sick.      Instead, use one of the brands made especially for pets      (pastes and brushes are sold in pet stores and through      veterinarians) or simply use a little dampened baking soda.      Usually, brushing twice a week is adequate. Don't be      disheartened if your pet doesn't take to the brushings      right away. Be patient. If brushing time becomes an ordeal,      just fall back to the finger play routine for another week      or so before trying the brush again. Sooner or later your      pet will become accustomed to the process and perhaps even      enjoy it. I've had people tell me that their dog will troop      into the living room with an expectant look and a      toothbrush in mouth if it hasn't received a brushing in a      while.</p><h3>Early Checkups</h3>    <p>      In addition to conscientious early acclimatization to the      tooth-brush, there's another reason to begin thinking about      dental care early on in your pet's life. The animal should      start to lose its baby (or deciduous) teeth when it's a few      months old, and all its adult teeth should be in place at      about six months of age. But not every pet has a mouth that      behaves according to plan; sometimes the baby teeth decide      to stay right where they are. The result, two rows of teeth      along one gum line, causes crowding and displacement of the      adult teeth, pockets in the gums where food can accumulate,      and, ultimately, disease and decay.    </p>    <p>      I've had to remove many a baby tooth that's failed to make      way for the adult tooth. Sometimes this requires surgery,      but more often it's a simple, in-office procedure. In any      event, it's better for you and your pet to have the work      done at four to six months of age than to wait until      disease has set in.    </p>    <h3>Proper Food</h3>    <p>      It's also important to get your new pets off on the right      foot food-wise. Hard, crunchy food helps clean away the      plaque deposits that cause tartar buildup and periodontal      disease. Be kind to your pet's chompers by making sure that      at least a portion of its daily menu includes something      crunchy and firm.    </p>    <p>      There is recent evidence that-in people, at      least-some foods are better for the teeth than      others. Cheese, citrus fruits, and peanuts, for example,      apparently help the teeth ward off cavities. Simple      starches and sticky foods such as raisins, however, may      increase the potential for tooth disease.    </p>    <p>      The worst edible for tooth health is sugar. Sugar-fed dogs      and cats develop cavities that look-and eventually      cause pain-just like the ones in people's mouths.    </p>    <p>      Finally, give your pet the same good <em>overall</em>      health care you give yourself. General good health has a      direct bearing on good dental health, and, sure enough,      vice-versa.    </p>
