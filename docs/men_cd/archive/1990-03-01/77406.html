                        <p>      <em>The first Earth Day was like a big party; the 20 years      since, like the day after. We've still got headaches, as      Barry Commoner, an elder of America's environmental      movement, reminds us. He is still strong. Still      urgent.</em>    </p>        <p>      On February 2, 1970, <em>Time</em> magazine chose to devote      its cover story to "Environment: Nixon's New Issue."      Ecologist Barry Commoner, hailed as the Paul Revere of "the      emerging science of survival," stared out at the reader      against a background half lush, half despoiled. Inside, the      eight-page feature detailed our growing ecological      problems, recommended a few possible solutions, and then,      almost as an aside, it mentioned an upcoming "nationwide      teach-in."<br />      <br />      The trouble with rereading that article, 20 years after the      original Earth Day, is that, all in all, it      <em>doesn't</em> sound dated. Despite the momentum      generated on that birth date of the national environmental      movement, despite the Clean Air and the Clean Water acts,      despite the establishment and promising start of the      Environmental Protection Agency, and despite all the      carefully scheduled deadlines for reducing pollution, the      nest has not gotten cleaner. The old pollution problems      weren't eliminated-and new ones have been added.    </p>    <p>      Barry Commoner <em>has</em> changed, though. He no longer      rides horseback, Revere-like, swinging a lantern and crying      a warning. Instead, he now looks back over the      environmental road we've all traveled in the past two      decades. Searching out the instances in which we've been      successful, he compares them to our failures and points out      a way to redirect our course so that when Earth Day III      comes around (2010; not that far away), we may not have to      start over-for yet a <em>third</em> time.    </p>    <p>      You may disagree with Commoner's controversial analysis,      but you can't knock his credentials. Since he first tackled      the strontium 90 dangers of atmospheric nuclear tests in      1953, he has been meeting environmental issues head-on,      full-time, and scientifically, as director of the Center      for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College in New      York. CBNS has tackled the economics of nuclear power, the      feasibility of organic farming, the ecology of urban rats,      the contamination of mother's milk by pesticides, and more.      The group's current emphasis is on waste disposal:      recycling versus incineration. A project of theirs on Long      Island, for example, recycled 84% of household trash, a      rate that could eliminate the need for incinerators      ("dioxin factories," Commoner calls them) and the cost      would be 35% that of incineration.    </p>    <p>      Assistant Editor Pat Stone interviewed Dr. Commoner in the      small CBNS library. In a courteous but no-nonsense      conversation, Commoner spoke with the vision of one who can      see both the trees <em>and</em> the forest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> Dr. Commoner, in your recent      writings, from <em>Greenpeace</em> magazine to the <em>New      Yorker</em> , you repeatedly claim that the environmental      movement has failed. Why?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> First, it's not simply the      environmental movement that has failed. The government      programs also have failed. The approach strategy taken by      the EPA and all of the state environmental regulatory      groups has been wrong. It hasn't worked. As a result,      there's been very little improvement in the environment,      and certain things have gotten worse.    </p>    <p>      This isn't just a hand-waving conclusion on my part. It's      based on actual numbers. Look at the changes in emissions      and pollutants. In 1970, the Clean Air Act Amendments      called for a 90% reduction in urban levels of carbon      monoxide, hydrocarbon, and ozone, setting a 1977 deadline      for achieving this goal. In 1977, with compliance not even      in sight, the deadline was moved to 1982. When that was      missed, the deadline was delayed once more to December 31,      1987. Now, with nearly 100 million people breathing      substandard air in urban areas that are still in      non-compliance, the dead line may be extended up to 25      years <em>more!</em>    </p>        <p>      The average improvement in air pollution levels, except for      lead, has been only about 14%, but even that small      improvement stopped in 1982.    </p>    <p>      Generally, almost all of the pollution levels have either      been just slightly improved, or gotten worse.    </p>    <p>      In a very few instances, we have succeeded. These allow us      to examine the specific reasons for environmental success      or failure. The answer is simple: If you don't put      something into the environment, it's not there. Air      emissions of lead have declined by 86% because much less      lead is now added to gasoline and therefore that much less      lead is contaminating the environment. The environmental      levels of DDT and PCB have dropped sharply because their      production and use have been banned. Mercury is much less      prevalent in the environment because it is no longer used      in manufacturing chlorine. Strontium 90 has decayed to low      levels because the United States and the Soviet Union have      had the simple wisdom to stop the atmospheric bomb tests      that produce it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> So the moral is ...    </p>    <p>      <em>The first full modern flowering of American      environmentalism occurred early in 1970, becoming an      "official" social issue by rating cover space on Time.      Unfortunately, the environmental realy is still      "half-and-half."</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> The moral is, controls don't      work. When a pollutant is attacked at its point of origin,      it can be eliminated. Once produced, it's too late.    </p>    <p>      The strategy has been to say, "OK, we've got these cars and      power plants and so on that produce pollutants. We're not      going to change them; we're just going to tack on control      devices": scrubbers, catalytic converters, things like      that. Such controls are ultimately self-defeating. To begin      with, the effect of a control device is never complete. An      exhaust-control system on a car does not trap all the      carbon monoxide produced, but, at best, only about<br />      of origin, it can be eliminated. Once produced, it's too      late.    </p>    <p>      The strategy has been to say, "OK, we've got these cars and      power plants and so on that produce pollutants. We're not      going to change them; we're just going to tack on control      devices": scrubbers, catalytic converters, things like      that. Such controls are ultimately self-defeating. To begin      with, the effect of a control device is never complete. An      exhaust-control system on a car does not trap all the      carbon monoxide produced, but, at best, only about 90% of      it. Besides, the effectiveness of the catalyst rapidly      declines with use. And as long as control devices are not      absolutely perfect-and none are-continued      increase in the pollution-generating activity (traffic, for      example) will gradually overwhelm the devices' effect on      environmental quality. Finally, in a number of cases,      there's no way to use a control. You can't put a filter on      agricultural pollution; there's no pipe out of which runoff      nitrate fertilizer comes, because it comes out of every      inch of the riverbank.    </p>    <p>      Environmental illness is simply an incurable disease. There      is no cure. It can only be prevented.    </p>    <p>      In other words, don't try to deal with the symptoms but      with the cause. Our big mistake is that we've been putting      on Band-Aids instead of going to the origin of the problem.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> What's that?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> The origin, and this is my main      message, is in the technology of production. Most of these      technologies were introduced after World War II and without      any consideration of their environmental impact: the new,      large, high-powered, smog-generating cars; the shift from      fuel-efficient railroads to gas-guzzling trucks and cars;      the substitution of many nonbiodegradable and hazardous      petrochemical products for biodegradable and less-toxic      natural products; the substitution of chemical fertilizers      for crop rotation and manure, and of toxic synthetic      pesticides for ladybugs and birds.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> Are there alternatives that are      viable today; ways to make the products we use without      generating pollution?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>Yes, existing technologies,      currently on the shelf, can be immediately applied for the      transition we need. Let's take agriculture. The way to      prevent pollution from fertilizers and pesticides is to      stop using them. It's known as organic farming. Fifteen      years ago, our center did a big study of 14 midwestem      organic farms and 14 very comparable conventional farms. We      followed them for five years and showed that the organic      farms produced about 8 1/2% less output, but they made      exactly the same amount of money per acre because they      didn't buy chemicals. There are now hundreds of such      studies, including one by the National Academy of Sciences.    </p>    <p>      Can smogless cars be built? They can. Indeed, they have      been. Every pre-World War II car was driven by a      low-compression engine; that's why the country was free of      smog then. In fact, nitrogen oxide production, the primary      cause of smog, can be prevented without giving up the      American car's precious overpowered engine (although doing      so is a good idea). The so-called stratified charge engine      can do just that. It isolates the spark from the rest of      the cylinder so that the high temperature is localized and      the engine doesn't run as hot. It's the high temperature      that causes nitrogen oxide to form and trigger the smog      reaction.    </p>    <p>      That engine was on a Honda Civic when the car was first      introduced. According to a 1974 National Science Foundation      study, prototypes were then already operating in Detroit.      But unlike adding a catalytic converter to the exhaust      system of the existing engine, producing stratified charge      engines would have required extensive retooling in      manufacturing plants, so the automobile industry didn't      build them.    </p>    <p>      There may be better ways of building cars now. In urban      areas, electric cars are perfectly feasible.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>Of course, that begs the question      of where the electricity comes from. Commoner: There are      ways of making electricity that are compatible with the      environment. In the first place, even using fossil fuels,      we'd be a lot better off using natural gas to make      electricity than using oil or coal. Then we could replace      the natural gas with solar methane made from manure or from      algae growing along the coasts. In doing this, we'd have a      solar fuel that has zero effect on carbon dioxide      production and the greenhouse problem.    </p>    <p>      We could also use photovoltaic cells. They would become      economically competitive with utility electricity if one      very simple thing were done: If the federal government were      to order half a billion dollars' worth of cells for its own      use, the industry would expand. The price would drop by      about 90% and then become competitive in most parts of the      country.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>One proposed fuel solution is      ethanol made from corn. But I've always suspected that      would take more fossil fuel energy to produce than you      would get from the finished fuel.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>It can; it's always possible to      do a good thing stupidly. But we don't have to do it that      way. In the first place, most of the energy is used for      distilling the ethanol, and we can do that with solar      stills. It is also important to change the crop system      appropriately. CBNS did a big study for the Department of      Energy on that. People say that making ethanol out of corn      will cut down on the available food supply, and it could.      But consider: Our current crops are designed biochemically      to feed animals, so they have a carbohydrate-to-protein      ratio of 6:1. Ethanol's made from only the carbohydrate      portion, so that leaves the residue incomplete as a feed.    </p>    <p>      What's the answer? Change the crop. Replace the present      com-and-soybean crop with corn and sugar beets. This      increases carbohydrate content while retaining the same      protein content as before. The residue from ethanol      production will then have just the right carbohydrate-to-      protein ratio to feed animals. We figured that fanners'      profits would double after 10 to 15 years from selling the      two products instead of just one.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>What about-to bring up the      buzzword made famous two decades ago in <em>The      Graduate</em> -plastics!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>The petrochemical industry is a      unique problem: Not only its wastes but its very products      degrade the environment. Every pound of plastic that's ever      been synthesized is either still with us or has been      burned. If it's still with us, it gets in the way. Birds      get strangled by it, turtles eat it, and so on. And if it's      burned, it pollutes the environment.    </p>    <p>      But you have to remember that the petrochemical industry      lives on displacing other industries. It's an industrial      parasite; the way we got plastics was by pushing out glass,      wood, paper, and metal from various applications. I'm      sitting on a plastic-upholstered chair right now. I'm old      enough to remember when I sat on chairs that were just      wooden or covered with cloth.<br />      I once looked at 100 products made from ethylene, a basic      petrochemical intermediate. Only two of them, recording      film and plastic heart valves, could not be produced with      other materials. So in this case, there would have to be a      big rollback of the industry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>Dr. Commoner, your solutions sound      simple, logical, even essential; but also close to      impossible. Realistically, how can they be achieved?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoners:</strong>Start with two facts: First, it      is an expressed and acknowledged national interest to clean      up the environment; to really clean it up, not do what      we've been doing. Every poll shows it. Leaders like Bush      and Thatcher acknowledge it.    </p>    <p>      Second, we now know how to do it: Alter the technologies of      production. That means we have to introduce the social      interest in environmental quality into the decision-making      process that governs production technology.    </p>    <p>      There we run into a very serious political problem. In our      economic system, that decision process is totally under      private control. A corporation's legal obligation is not to      the nation but to its stockholders. Its decisions are made      in the private interest, and that interest is maximizing      profit.    </p>    <p>      So we now have to confront the clash between our economic      ideology, which is capitalism, and the new idea that social      interest in environmental quality must now intrude into      this private province.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>Are you talking about the dreaded S      word: socialism?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>The scientific definition of      socialism is social ownership and control of the means of      production. What is important here is social control, not      of every single piece of production but of the crucial      ones. Clearly, society has to say, Build cars that do not      produce smog. But it doesn't have to say how to make the      wheels.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>Or take the profit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>Right, in fact, it's very      important to understand that private profit is essential.      Otherwise, where do you get the resources to continue      expanding the economic system? It's simply a question of      whether profit maximization-that is, increasing the      profit at all costs-is to be regarded as the sole      criterion for making fundamental changes in the means of      production.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>But we already make some production      decisions based on environmental rather than financial      values. We banned lead for social reasons, for instance.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>The reason why lead was banned is      sort of a joke. It wasn't because people got up in arms and      said lead is poisonous, which has been known for years. It      turned out that lead poisons the catalyst in the catalytic      converters used to destroy carbon monoxide. That's why the      EPA took the lead out of gasoline.    </p>    <p>      There are more positive examples. My favorite one is what      happened with Alar. The EPA knows it's carcinogenic but      doesn't do anything. The National Resource Defense Council      issues a report that says the levels in apples and apple      juice are too high and should be reduced. That's another      example of the control strategy, of course.    </p>    <p>      But then mothers hear all this, decide they're supposed to      feed their kids healthful food, and stop buying apple juice      and apples. Sales go way down; the growers scream; and      Uniroyal, the company that produces Alar, takes it off the      market.    </p>    <p>      That's what I call environmental democracy. Environmental      democracy is responsible for essentially killing the      nuclear power industry. The people said, We don't want      this-loudly enough that the industry had to put so      many controls on it that they priced it out of the market.      The big upsurge in recycling is a result of environmental      democracy, of public opposition to incinerators.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>Do we really need to make a      sweeping political change? Can't we just fix problems on a      case-by-case basis rather than changing our economic      system?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>No. Look at the Soviet Union.      There was a severe contradiction between the Soviet Union's      ideological foundation and its practical situation: the      impossible state of the country's economy, the apathy of      the people, and so on. It was a clash between ideology and      reality. Now they've confronted that clash with glasnost      and perestroika.    </p>    <p>      Well, in the United States there's a clash between our      ideology and the environmental situation, the housing      situation, and the totally inadequate medical care system.      Our educational system's in bad shape. This is the richest      country in history, yet poverty here is getting worse.      What's wrong? There's a clash between our ideology, which      says that the way in which an economy develops is by      private corporations deciding how to maximize their      profits, and what we expect our economy to be-a      marvelously productive system in which everybody prospers.    </p>    <p>      The only thing is we haven't recognized it yet. Every time      somebody raises the issue-from Catholic bishops to      presidential candidates- there's dead silence. The      idea is so foreign to what passes for our national ideology      that even to mention it violates a deep-seated taboo.<br />      In truth, we need a perestroika of our own.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong>You're saying pollution prevention      via controlling methods of production is the key to      improving the environment. Let's look at some other      proposed solutions. Many environmentalists, such as      soft-energy guru Amory Lovins with the Rocky Mountain      Institute, stress energy conservation as key to solving our      problems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>Energy conservation is essential,      but it's not sufficient. It's a control-not a      prevention-strategy and is inimical to economic      development. Suppose you go into a Third World country and      tell them that, to reduce their carbon dioxide output, they      should improve their energy efficiency by 50%, which is a      lot. In the next 10 years or so, that country will want to      double its energy output, which will wipe out the effect of      the conservation. What they really need is solar energy,      which eliminates carbon dioxide production completely.    </p>    <p>      I like to point out that there are really three tasks. One      is dealing with local and national pollution issues.      Another is combating global problems like the greenhouse      effect and destruction of the ozone layer. But then there's      a Third World problem because, in the next 40 or 50 years,      the Third World is going to be responsible for 90% of the      growth in the world's population and for most of its growth      in production. You have to take their needs into account.      They need to develop, and it's essential that their      development be based on ecologically sound technologies.    </p>    <p>      It's very important not to try to solve one of these three      problems at the expense of another. There are plenty of      suggestions that would do that. For example, the nuclear      power people are happy to come along and say, "We can take      care of the greenhouse problem very nicely." But of course,      they would do so at the expense of a huge pollution      problem. Energy conservation at the expense of Third World      development is a similarly incomplete solution.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> So you would disagree with      environmentalists who say we need a no-growth, steady-state      society.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>Yes, absolutely.    </p>    <p>      That argument is based on the misconception that the earth      is a dosed system with finite resources. It's just not      true. Yes, mineral resources are finite; but with enough      energy available they can be recycled and reused      indefinitely. And the energy needed is available. The earth      is an open ther-modynamic system with enormous amounts of      energy pouring in from the sun every day. If only 10% of      the solar energy falling on the land could be captured, it      would still be possible to expand our present rate of      energy use perhaps a hundredfold before encountering the      theoretical limit of growth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> But if we just keep on expanding,      building collectors everywhere, adding more people, growing      ever more food, we're going to have to take over a lot of      land and wipe out many of our ecosystems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong>All that I'm saying is that      economic development based on ecologically sound      technologies is possible. The issue we face, then, is not      how to facilitate environmental quality by limiting      economic development but how to create a system of      production that can grow and develop in harmony with the      environment. There are ways of doing that without razing      rain forests or damaging ecosystems at this time, because      there is an awful lot of solar energy we're not using.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> Many environmentalists, such as      Paul Ehrlich and Garrett Hardin, blame our woes on      overpopulation: The ever-growing number of people is      stretching the resources of the planet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> Population is a political issue,      not an ecological issue. At this moment we produce twice as      much food as needed to give every person on Earth a      physiologically adequate diet. The real problem is poverty.      Excess population is a symptom of poverty, not the other      way around. Compare England and Haiti: Neither country      produces enough food for its own population's needs, but      hunger is much more prevalent in Haiti than it is in      England, because Haiti cannot afford to import enough food      to make up this deficit, while England can.    </p>    <p>      The truth is evident: the population problem was imposed on      Third World countries during colonialism.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> How?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> Look at a typical situation: The      Dutch went into Indonesia. Before they got there, Indonesia      had a high birthrate and a high death rate, so the      country's population was stable. The Dutch came in,      introduced doctors, engineers, and so on. The death rate      dropped, and the population started growing quickly.    </p>    <p>      That's exactly what happened in Holland with the Industrial      Revolution. However, as the standard of living rose, after      30 or 40 years, people there realized that more children      were surviving. So they began having fewer, and the      birthrate began to drop.    </p>    <p>      The demographic transition where you go from a stable      population with high death and birthrates to a stable      population with low death and birthrates depends on a      constantly rising standard of living. The Dutch started the      first phase of that transition in Indonesia but prevented      the second by taking the wealth back to Holland to help      them go through their own demographic transition. I call      that demographic parasitism. We imposed this population      burden on the Third World countries, and we owe them      reparation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> What about the importance of      individual action? For instance, one emphasis of Mother      Earth News when it was founded 20 years ago was to go back      to the land and live more harmoniously with nature.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> I absolutely understand that      there are people who will feel better living on a farm as      close to nature as they can. But that is not an      ecologically required position. And it won't accomplish      much in the way of environmental change. I regard that as      the same sort of thing as somebody who decides to play the      flute. If your happiness depends on playing the flute,      fine; but don't tell everybody else to play it.    </p>    <p>      Besides, the value of an urban symphony is not replaced by      the sound of a shepherd's pipe. The values that are      represented by cities are worthwhile, and we should find      ecologically sound ways of achieving them. For example,      there's no reason at all why you have to have air pollution      in the city. You can get rid of every fossil fuel-burning      device in it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> Perhaps the main issue here isn't      just the old "city mouse versus country mouse" conflict,      but one of having a positive, individual impact. The      impulse to live in the country and to garden organically      may be the same one that motivates an urban commuter to      bicycle to work or use string shopping bags. Do you feel      such individual actions are important, or are they all just      flute playing?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> There's value in them, if they      orient you toward a social act. In other words, instead of      just using string shopping bags yourself, work to have a      law passed to ban the plastic ones. There are several      hundred towns in Italy that have done this.    </p>    <p>      I urge people to find a social mechanism for dealing with      the problem that's bothering them. Otherwise, the personal      act may be a way of avoiding the social act-a form of      escapism.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> You think trying to live a more      environmentally positive lifestyle is escapist?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> Recognize it for what it is: a      way of feeling good. I'm all in favor of people doing what      makes them feel good. But let's not confuse that with      solving the problem. Don't declare such acts as      ecologically sound. In the first place, there's no way of      isolating yourself from all the ecological faults in the      system. And in some cases, such acts interfere with solving      the problem.    </p>    <p>      Take recycling as a marvelous example. A lot of      environmentally minded people say, "Let's have a law that      requires 25% recycling." Is that good? No, it's bad. Why?      Because if you pass a law for 25% recycling, you're      guaranteeing 75% incineration. If you're doing recycling to      feel good, 25% is great. If you're doing recycling to solve      the trash problem, go for the maximum possible amount. In a      pilot test in East Hampton, Long Island, we achieved 84.4%      recycling.    </p>    <p>      Ecological metaphors like string shopping bags or planting      trees can be used to get rid of personal guilt. They don't      provide solutions, and, in some cases, they interfere with      the solutions. That's my position. Look, the problem is not      in your head or my head. It's in the corporate boardrooms.      That's where pollution begins.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> So you come down pretty hard on      people who try to "live more gently on the earth," if they      don't also work on a larger, societal scale. From what I've      read, you also come down pretty hard on many of the      environmental organizations as well.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> The environmental movement has      split in two.    </p>    <p>      The old-line groups in Washington live by the control      strategy. Their bread and butter are legislation and      standards. More recently, they're negotiating with      corporations as to what levels of pollution are acceptable.      You have, for example, the head of the worst waste      management company in the country-they're all pretty      bad-on the board of directors of the National      Wildlife Federation. I don't see that; no way you can do      that and function very well.    </p>    <p>      The cutting edge of the environmental movement now is the      grassroots groups. There are now 5,000 to 6,000 citizens'      groups in towns and cities all over the country. They      aren't "environmentalists" per se; they're simply people      concerned with such problems as incineration and waste      dumps, who are acting on them. They have adopted the      prevention strategy and are ready to go head-to-head      against the corporations. Now there are federations of      these groups.    </p>    <p>      In a number of cases, the old-line national organizations      have lost their influence locally and have even stood in      the way of what really needs to be done. Here in New York,      the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental      Defense Fund worked with the sanitation department in      promoting incineration, whereas the people in the community      were fighting it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> How do you feel about the prospect      of establishing a Green parry in the U.S.?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> I think I'm qualified to talk      about third parties; I tried running for president on one.      <em>[Editor's note: Commoner was the candidate of the      Citizen's party in 1980. Today, he's the environmental      advisor for Jesse Jackson's campaigns.]</em> The Greens      have had fantastic success in Europe; 10% of the Italian      Parliament is now Green. But they work in countries that      have parliamentary democracies, where you get political      representation in proportion to your share of the vote.      There's no way a Green parry would succeed in our two-party      system, because it wouldn't capture a majority of the vote.    </p>    <p>      The environmental movement will not by itself solve the      environmental problem; it can't, because that problem      involves a fundamental political issue which can only be      resolved by everybody. The great virtue of the      environmental movement is that it illuminates this issue      more readily than many other ways of looking at it. You      see, the environment is only part of the problem. The other      parts are jobs, poverty, discrimination-and they're      all connected at the same point: the governance of the      means of production. How can women and minorities get paid      as well as white males? By gaining some governance of the      source of our wealth, the system of production. So the      environmentalists need to find common ground with the civil      rights movement, the women's movement, the peace movement.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> Many environmentalists might think      they should be concerned only with environmental issues and      stay out of those other ones. Commoner: Do that and you      won't succeed, not because you're interested in the      environment but because you're intruding into this      carefully protected private right. The issue then becomes      this generic one of social governance, and unions and other      groups are interested in that too. If you attack the      problem at the root, you'll find yourself surrounded by      allies, because there are people who have different      problems that go to that same root.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> It sounds like a tall order. Do      you really think it's possible?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> This is the wrong time in      history to say it can't be done. If Eastern Europe can      accept democratic reforms, if Russia can talk about free      markets, why can't we talk about social governance of the      means of production? In the past, I would have said that      I'm an optimist and I'd like to think it could be done. But      today I say that it's unwise and unworthy of us to claim      that we can't do it.    </p>    <p>      This is our chance; the situation is ripe. The ecologically      sound technologies exist. There's worldwide concern about      the environment. This innate democratic sense that people      have is just bursting out everywhere. There are incipient      movements in the right direction. And most important,      really, there's the opportunity for getting the funds      needed to make the ecological transition. They can only be      gotten from the military budget; and with some disarmament      already, and more happening fast, the military budget is up      for grabs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mother:</strong> Do you think Earth Day will have      an impact?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Commoner:</strong> I think Earth Day 1990 will      elevate consciousness to a new level. Of course, we did      that in 1970, but because we didn't understand the problem      analytically, we allowed the wrong things to be done. I      think you only get a few chances to make mistakes like      that. This time we better not make a mistake.    </p>    <p>      It's very important that, in 1990, people understand that      the control strategy has failed, that prevention is the      only way to go, and that prevention means confronting the      corporations where they live and where we live.    </p>
