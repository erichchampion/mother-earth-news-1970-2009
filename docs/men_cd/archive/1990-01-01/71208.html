                    <h5 id="byline">      by David Petersen    </h5>    <p>      <strong>That which we call a skunk, by any other name would      still smell</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NEIGHBOR ON THE MOUNTAIN</strong> here had quite      an adventure this past winter.    </p>    <p>      Dick lives in a cabin that juts out sharply from a steep      slope and is supported on its downhill side by tall      foundation stilts. With the ample subfloor area sided in      and insulated with battings of fiberglass, the resulting      crawl space is dark, dry, and warm. It is these attractions      that have made the place a mecca for wild things that      tunnel their way in and pull the insulation from the walls      for nests. The invaders include mice, pack rats, and      others.    </p>    <p>      It was one of the others that cost Dick several nights'      sleep and led him to become a reluctant local legend.    </p>    <p>      Resigned to battling rodents as part of the country      lifestyle, Dick kept his crawl space mined with an array of      mouse- and rattraps, all well baited and checked regularly.      Late one December night while Dick, his wife, and their dog      slept, a skunk got under the cabin and did its worst.    </p>    <p>      Groggy, unwilling to leave his warm bed and go out into the      cold night on a wild skunk chase, Dick promised he'd see to      it come morning, then buried his face in the blankets and      suffered through the remainder of the night while his wife      mumbled unpleasantries and their dog sneezed and whined.    </p>         <p>      A striped skunk relaxes in a Montana dandelion field. Cute      as the image is, the skunk probably game to snack rather      than to smell.    </p>    <p>      Up at daylight, Dick went down and propped open the      crawl-space door. No skunk in sight. He left the door open      and went to work. That evening, a flashlight in one hand,      the other holding a kerchief over his face, he ventured in.      The evidence was plain enough. The skunk had tunneled in      under the back wall directly below the bedroom, then run      amok, shredding insula tion from the walls, fuming over      garden tools and paint cans, and, in the process, setting      off a mousetrap-which, Dick guessed; was what had prompted      the big stink.    </p>    <p>      My neighbor repaired and rehung the torn insulation      battings, filled in the skunk's shallow entrance hole, and      placed a mousetrap near the patch. Should the pest return      and try to enter at the same spot again, Dick figured, it      would land a paw in the trap while digging in, which should      scare it away.    </p>    <p>      A couple of nights later the skunk came back, and Dick's      plan worked, all too well.    </p>    <p>      When the trap clapped shut, it scared the skunk off, all      right, but not before the startled animal fired a farewell      salute. This time the cabin and its contents, including the      clothes hanging in the bedroom closet, were so thoroughly      permeated that for days thereafter people wrinkled their      noses and made impolite comments when Dick or his wife      walked past. And this after airing the place thoroughly and      laundering every garment they owned. Even the family dog, a      house hound by preference, took to spending most of his      time out in the woods.    </p>    <p>      Clearly, something had to be done.    </p>    <p>      Toward that end, my neighbor again backfilled the skunk      tunnel, this time reinforcing the packed earth with a      cinder block. Then he put out a large box of rat poison.    </p>    <p>      A few nights later, the persistent skunk returned and again      fired off its dreadful load. Dick's wife threatened to      leave home. The dog did leave home. A check the next      morning revealed that the skunk had dug in at a new      location and devoured the entire box of poison before      disappearing. But no traps had been tripped, and why the      animal had sprayed was a mystery.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>A pistol in one hand, a flashlight in the      other, and a kerchief over his face, he crouched into the      crawl space.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      The stench eventually faded, and for the next several weeks      my neighbors thought they had finally put an end to the big      stink. Then one warm, early spring afternoon the dreaded      perfume once again came wafting up from beneath the cabin,      smelling worse than ever. The skunk was back. Or, more      likely, a replacement had arrived. In broad daylight, no      less. It must be down there now.    </p>        <p>      Without a word, Dick got out his .22 target pistol, stuffed      the clip with hypervelocity, hollow-point ammunition, and      jacked a round into the chamber. With the pistol in one      hand, a flashlight in the other, and a kerchief tied over      his face, he crouched into the crawl space and followed his      nose to a pile of boxes stacked in a cobwebby back corner.      Carefully approaching the spot, he inched the boxes aside      and saw, lying curled and apparently asleep on a nest of      pink fiberglass, a small striped skunk. Resigned, he aimed      and fired. The skunk jerked and Dick fired again, before      the animal had a chance to rally and shoot back.    </p>    <p>      After poking his victim with a shovel to be certain it was      agreeable to being handled, Dick reached over and grabbed      the big black-and-white tail . . . which came away in his      hand.    </p>    <p>      After he regained control of his stomach, my neighbor      braced himself and rolled the corpse over with his shovel.      It was rotten, boiling with maggots. Obviously, it had been      dead for a very long time. That jerk after the first shot      was no death spasm, as Dick had thought, but a mere      inanimate reaction to the shock of the close-range bullet's      impact. There was no option; my mortified neighbor scooped      up the mess with his shovel, carried it out, and buried it      deep and well away from the cabin.    </p>    <p>      As he later explained it to me, he reckoned that the skunk,      after pigging out on poison, had sickened and retreated to      the hidden nest in the corner. There, it fired off one last      barrage in protest, and expired. After a while the stench      had faded, returning only when decomposition got around to      spilling the contents of the musk glands.    </p>    <p>      Too bad for Dick, his wife, and their dog (not to mention      the skunk) that he didn't know more about this amiable,      interesting species and its habits, for he could easily      have discouraged it from wanting to nest in his crawl      space, thereby avoiding the big stink. Several times.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AMERICA'S SKUNKS BELONG TO THE</strong> subfamily      Mephitinae (from the Latin <em>mephi</em> tis, meaning      poison gas), which comprises three genera. Between them,      the three fairly blanket the lower 48 states, Canada to      Mexico and sea to shining sea.    </p>    <p>      The most numerous of this fetid trio, and the one that      raised such a stink with my neighbor, is the striped skunk,      a stocky, short-legged, long-haired animal whose jet black      coat is trimmed with two wide white stripes running up the      back and converging at the nape. A single thin white line      descends from forehead to nose. The tail is almost as long      as the body and lushly furred, with a blurred white stripe      along its top. Since it ranges across all of the U.S. save      parts of Utah, Nevada, and southern California, this is the      skunk you're most likely to see. And smell.    </p>    <p>      A sister species to the striped skunk (they share the same      genus) is the hooded skunk, a two-toner with white head,      back, and tail, and black undercarriage. (There's also a      nearly all-black phase.) Its range in the U.S. is      restricted to the southern portions of Arizona, New Mexico,      and Texas.    </p>         <p>      <strong>It's cuddly as a kitten, but not to be petted. In      addition to its famous odor, a skunk can carry      rabies.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Next in abundance is the little spotted skunk, a smaller,      slimmer, sleeker animal built much like a weasel-to which      family (Mustelidae) all skunks in fact belong. Although      commonly called a civet cat, the spotted skunk is no more a      civet (which is an inhabitant of Asia and Africa) than the      prong horn-is an antelope. F or that matter, the spot ted      skunk isn't truly spotted, either, but marked with a      hodgepodge of blurred stripes and splotches, the pattern      varying more or less among individuals. The spotted skunk      ranges across most of the southern and western United      States.    </p>    <p>      The rarest of our stinkers (though some would say not      nearly rare enough) is the hognosed skunk, an emigrant from      Mexico. The hog-nose resembles the striped skunk in size      and shape, and the hooded skunk in range (portions of      Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and a tiny bit of      Nevada). Its snout looks pretty much like what its name      implies. Its back is marked with two wide white or y      ellowish stripes, or it may be solid white.    </p>    <p>      By and large, all three genera share the same habits,      appetites, and dispositions, and so can be discussed as      one-with the exception that the spotted skunk, with its      streamlined build, is far more energetic and athletic than      its rotund cousins. (For a couple of examples, it can climb      trees, which the others can't, and is said to perform a      handstand just before or while spraying.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, what makes a skunk a skunk, no matter its genus      or species, is the tear-gas musk it can jet, on demand,      from twin events located on either side of the rectum. When      the tail comes up, these normally retracted nipples      protrude, ready for action.    </p>    <p>      My comparison of skunk musk to tear gas is no mere      metaphor; I've been doused a couple of times with each,      and-though tear gas (known technically as CN) is in fact a      gas, while skunk musk is a thick, yellowish liquid, and      their active ingredients differ-I can draw no clear      distinction between their ef fects. Both cause extreme      irritation to eyes and sinuses. Both interfere with      respiration. Both bring on nausea, headache, and      uncontrollable tearing, nasal drainage, and salivation. And      both, with a direct hit to the eyes, can cause temporary      blindness. Tear gas, however, is far less malodorous,      quicker to fade, and easier to wash off than is skunk musk.    </p>    <p>      For a tail gunner, the skunk's aim is superb. And it always      aims for an enemy's eyes. The animal can fire its twin      weapons singly or in unison, with an accurate range of      eight to 10 feet (less if shooting into a stiff breeze,      more if the target is downwind). Several rounds of a few      drops each (that's all it takes) can be discharged in rapid      succession before the ammunition pouches are depleted.    </p>    <p>      A popular misconception holds that the skunk can shoot only      straight back. In fact, the animal rarely sprays directly      to its rear, preferring a slightly angled stance so that it      can keep an eye on its target. According to credible      reports, in a real pinch the striped skunk can even hump up      and fire over its own back while facing the threat.    </p>    <p>      A good thing it is, then, that the skunk isn't      trigger-happy. Unless surprised at very close range or      pushed too hard too fast, the easy go ing creature almost      always gives you three warnings before resorting to its      sole and essential means of self-defense. So long as a      skunk is moving away or paying you no mind, you're safe.      But if the animal stops suddenly, turns to face you, and      stamps its forepaws, consider yourself <em>cautioned. If      you</em> continue to advance or otherwise behave in a      threatening manner (throwing rocks will do it), the skunk      will turn away and erect its tail, save for the tip, which      will remain drooped. The animal may also hiss. You have now      been <em>warned.</em> If and when the tip of the tail snaps      to attention and spreads, you have received your third and      final warning, a <em>threat.</em> If you're within range,      it's now too late to turn and run or try to back away;      rather, freeze in your tracks, try to relax, divert your      eyes, turn your face slowly away, say something friendly in      a soft tone, and hope the skunk accepts these gestures of      acquiescence.    </p>    <p>      But it might not, so it's handy to know what can be done to      limit the damage should you, a companion, or a pet get hit      with the big stork.    </p>    <p>      First, to minimize contact of the musk with your skin (it's      acidic and can burn), remove any sprayed garments. Second,      if water is available, wash the affected area (generally      the face and eyes) immediately and thoroughly. And third,      deodorize.    </p>    <p>      A tomato-juice rubdown is the best known of the folk      "deskunkers," and it works, sort of. For those of us who      can chase the tomato scrub with a hot shower, it's OK. But      for a dog or cat that you have no intention of taking into      the house, much less the shower, tomato juice isn't so      wonderful. I had occasion to try this treatment on my big,      longhaired mutt a couple of summers back, and it did help      to neutralize the stench and ease his suffering. But the      thick, sticky juice also made an impossibly matted mess of      his coat, necessitating an outdoor washtub bath that      neither of us enjoyed.    </p>    <p>      Other home remedies include mustard, vinegar, and diluted      chlorine bleach.    </p>    <p>      But what if you're way off somewhere in the boonies and      fresh out of tomato juice, mustard, vinegar, and bleach? In      that case, build a small fire and stand (or hold your pet)      in the smoke of burning grass, hay, juniper, or cedar.      Similarly, owners of woodstoves can help freshen a skunked      house by build ing a slow fire of cedar or juniper, then      closing the top damper and opening the stove door so that      the fragrant smoke fills the room. (Neither of these sister      woods contains pitch or other resins, so, unless you      drastically overdo it, you needn't worry about smoke      damage.)    </p>    <p><strong><em>Skunks consume many insect and rodent pests . .      . as well as garden crops, eggs, and young domestic      fowl.</em></strong></p>      <p>      The obvious problem with most of these home detoxifiers is      that the cure can be nearly as unpleasant as the curse.      Therefore, anyone whose profession or recreation puts them      at high risk of being skunked, or who has children or pets      that enjoy running wild in the woods, would do well to      purchase and keep at the ready a small squeeze bottle of      one of the clean, very effective commercial skunk      antidotes, such as Skunk Stuff or Skunk Off'.    </p>    <p>      For good reason, skunks never employ their musk when      quarreling amongst themselves. Neither do they use it to      subdue prey. Rather, like their weasel cousins, they go for      the necks of rivals and prey with their hunter's teeth. An      example:    </p>    <p>      I was bowhunting up the slope of a brushy ridge one evening      this past autumn, sneaking along in hopes of catching a      glimpse of something with antlers and good lean meat.      Sensing movement just behind and off to my left, I froze      and slowly turned my head for a peek. What I saw was no      deer or elk, but a very large and beautiful striped skunk,      out and about somewhat early for a primarily nocturnal      species. The animal was insoucianteither unaware of my      camouflaged presence or totally uncaring as it went about      its business of sniffing around for dinner. I allowed my      fellow hunter to pass, then followed along behind at a      distance of a few yards. The animal trailed not the      slightest trace of odor.    </p>    <p>      This skunk's hunting technique, typical of the genus,      involved zigzagging its way from downed log to downed log,      rooting along the edges of each in search of something      edible. Once, it came up with a vole in its mouth, which it      promptly tossed down whole. I would have guessed that a      skunk would torment its food for a while, catlike, before      consuming it. But the tiny rodent had been caught, killed,      and swallowed all in a toothy flash. No cat's play there;      just the serious business of survival.    </p>    <p>      Skunks are opportunistic feeders, omnivorous and less      meat-minded than most other members of the weasel family.      While mice, voles, shrews, rats, and other small mammals      are significant in the skunk's diet, it also consumes a      wide variety of vegetables, and its favorite food, at least      during the warm months, is insects. Especially relished are      grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, and members of the wasp      clan. Reports are abundant of individual skunks devouring      several hundred insect pests in a single day.    </p>    <p>      Concerning reputation: While it's true that a skunk will      occasionally pilfer the eggs and young of wild and domestic      fowl, it much prefers the eggs of the snapping turtle and      will consume all it can sniff out and exhume from the mud      in which they're deposited. In the big picture, then, the      skunk is of great benefit to both humankind and nature, and      only a minor and occasional nuisance.    </p>    <p>      Still, while it would be a serious moral and ecological      mistake to condemn skunks a priori as bad guys and gun down      every one we see, it's nevertheless sometimes necessary to      eliminate a persistent troublemaker. When hit with a      well-placed shot, a skunk will generally die before it has      time to muster a reprisal.    </p>    <p>      If you're not a shooter, you can easily catch a marauding      skunk in a live trap; they're trusting creatures and come      readily to baits such as meat or sweets. The capture      accomplished, approach slowly, cover the trap and its      inmate with an old blanket, and transport the works to a      suitable release site several miles distant. (Around here,      a preferred drop zone is near the headquarters of a      particularly unconscionable land developer.) Don't worry:      Skunks have learned down through the ages that it's unwise      to spray while inside a den or other dark, confined space      (they have no special defense against their own offense)      and seem to extend this instinctive selfrestraint to      covered traps and cages as well. So long as you handle your      prisoner gently, there is little to fear.    </p>    <p>      If it's an egg or poultry thief you're up against, you can      skunk-proof your coop by siding it with metal roofing or      plywood from a foot belowground (to prevent digging) up to      a height of at least three feet; while skunks can scoot      right up and over a wire fence, they can't climb a hard,      smooth surface.    </p>    <p>      When skunks work their way under a building, like into my      neighbor's crawl space, they're not, looking so much for      food as for a dark, secure place to snooze through the day      or lay low for the winter (they're not bona fide      hibernators, but take extended naps between occasional      nocturnal outings). Therefore, a quick, easy, inexpensive,      and almost sure defense against subfloor skunk invaders is      a light. If a crawl space isn't dark, it just doesn't feel      like home to a skunk. For added protection, you can      sprinkle mothballs on the ground around the inside of the      foundation. Skunks don't like mothballs. They stink.      Finally, avoid using spun fiberglass for crawl-space      insulation, since it seems to be an irresistible      nestbuilding material.    </p>    <p>      Too bad my neighbor Dick didn't know about these little      tricks. If he had, he could have spared himself and his      family the big stink. Several times.    </p>    <p>      And, more important, he could have avoided becoming locally      celebrated as the man who gunned down a dead skunk. Twice.    </p>    <h3>SKUNKS AND RABIES</h3>    <p>      <strong>THE SKUNK IS THE PRIMARY WILD</strong>life carrier      of rabies in the contiguous United States (raccoons are      second). According to Dr. Thomas Eng of the Centers for      Disease Control in Atlanta, during the years 1980 through      1988, an average of 2,814 cases of rabies in skunks were      confirmed annually. Although most common in the Midwest and      West, none of the lower 48 states is completely free from      the threat.    </p>    <p>      Thankfully, the old rabies torturetreatment involving 13      painful injections to the stomach has been superseded by a      modern prophylaxis that requires only five shots in the arm      and is 100°70 effective when administered promptly.      Still, a close encounter with rabies is a thrill worth      avoiding.    </p>    <p>      Rabid wild animals, skunks or otherwise, rarely pose a      <em>direct</em> threat to humans. More often, dogs and cats      that haven't been inoculated against the disease contract      it when pestering an infected wild animal, then pass it      along to humans. Thus, the first line of rabies defense is      to have your pets vaccinated in accordance with local law      (and see to it that your neighbors follow suit). Do that,      and avoid handling or harassing wild animals, and the      threat of contracting rabies, which is already minor, can      be virtually eliminated.    </p>
