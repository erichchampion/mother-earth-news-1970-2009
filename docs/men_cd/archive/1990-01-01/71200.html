            <p>      Issue # 121-January/February 1990    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Fred Schaaf    </h5>    <p>      <strong>WHETHER YOU'RE AN</strong>accomplished amateur      astronomer or simply a casual observer, 1990's night skies      will <em>offer some</em> real treats. Among the      astronomical events of the months to come are the best look      at Mars we'll get until 2001, and many striking      conjunctions (close pairings) of the moon with major      planets. Topping the list, though, is the likelihood that      the sun will reach an unusually high peak of activity      rivaling even 1957-58's record maximum. One result will be      brilliant displays of northern lights visible virtually      everywhere in the United States.    </p>        <p class="caption">      <strong>A calendar illustrated by the kaleidoscopic night      sky.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>This year, our sun is expected to enter a period of      unusually high activity-perhaps the highest in      centuries-producing many sunspots and solar      flares.</strong>    </p>        <p class="caption">      <strong>LUNAR LORE Dates are based on eastern standard and      eastern daylight time. Some dates, therefore, may differ by      a day in other time zones. Right: Sunlight, reaching the      moon from the upper left in</strong> <strong>this      illustration, creates its phases- 1) new moon, 2) crescent,      3) first quarter, 4) gibbous, and 5) full. The moon then      wanes through the sequence in reverse. Far right: A      calendar of moon phases.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Sun and Northern Lights    </h3>    <p>      The sun reaches a period of "maximum" activity-sunspots,      flares, etc. -every 11 years or so. However, this year's      anticipated maximum-expected around March-may present us      with a higher level of activity than almost any other year      in recent <em>centuries.</em>    </p>    <p>      That's the logical conclusion, at least, to be drawn from      1989's activity, which produced dozens of naked-eye sunspot      groups and counts of over 260 sunspots at a time by expert      observers. <em>(Never</em> view the sun directly unless you      have the proper filters and the expertise to use them.)      Last year, solar flares disturbed radio and electrical      systems all over the world (6 million people in Quebec      temporarily lost their electricity thanks to one of the      March flares). And on the nights of March 12 and 13, 1989,      the northern lights shone spectacularly, casting glowing,      fluctuating patches of red light across all the U.S. and as      far south as Central America! <em>[Editor's note: For a      thorough discussion of the northern lights, details on when      and where to look for auroral displays, and tips on      observing and photographing the phenomenon, see</em>      <em>Mr. Schaaf's article, "Return of the Northern Lights,      "in the September/October 1989 issue of</em>      <em>MOTHER.</em>    </p>        <p class="caption">      <strong>The red planet, Mars, will shine with uncommon      brilliance in the night skies this summer and fall</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Moon    </h3>    <p>      On December 2 this year, the moon will be as close to us as      it will get in the final quarter of the 20th century. On      that day the distance from the moon's center to Earth's      will be just 221,545 miles-only 93 miles more than its      absolute closest approach during the period 1750 to 2125.      Also in December, the moon will be full twice in the same      month-a situation not to be repeated until August 1993.    </p>        <p class="caption">      <strong>In 1990 the moon will come as close to Earth as      will get for the rest of this century, and we'll      wit</strong> <strong>ness two</strong> ,: <strong>full      moons in the same month: December.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Even more intriguing than the near moon, though, are 1990's      opportunities to see breathtakingly slender lunar      cres cents. Back on May 5, 1989, using 11 X 80 binoculars,      Robert C. Victor in East Lansing, Michigan, set a new world      record for seeing the moon soonest after the invisible new      moon phase: 13 hours, 28 minutes after new. On May 24,      1990, observers on the East Coast of the U.S. will have an      opportunity to see a moon even "younger" than Victor's. And      April 25 and November 18 will also provide chances to see      thin crescent moons low in the west after sunset. Superb      charts for helping find all the year's slender crescent      moons (as well as others for locating and viewing the stars      and planets) can be found in Guy Ottewell's excellent      atlas-sized <em>Astronomical Calendar,</em> available for      $14 postpaid from Astronomical Workshop, Furman University,      Greenville, SC 29613.    </p>        <h3>      Eclipses    </h3>    <p>      For most Americans, this will be a poor year for viewing      eclipses. January 26's annular solar eclipse won't be      visible at all from the U.S., and the total lunar eclipse      of February 9 and partial lunar eclipse of August 6 will be      visible in the United States only from parts of Alaska.      Likewise, July 22's total solar eclipse will appear as just      a small partial eclipse near sunset in the U.S., and then      only for observers on the Pacific Coast and in Alaska,      Hawaii, and the Northwest.    </p>    <p>      Eclipse enthusiasts can take some consolation, though,      knowing that 1990 brings us just that much closer to July      11,1991: the date of the longest total solar eclipse for      decades to come. Baja California and the Big Island of      Hawaii are the favored spots for viewing what promises to      be an awesome event, one none of us should miss. Would-be      eclipse tourists had better make their reservations soon,      though; hotels in prime viewing areas are already filling      up. (One experienced tour agency handling the 1991 eclipse      is Scientific Expeditions, Code F, 211 East 43rd St., Suite      1404, New York, NY 10017.)    </p>    <h3>      Meteor Showers and Comets    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Meteors, more</strong> popularly called shooting      stars or falling stars, are actually pieces of rock or iron      from outer space that burn up in our atmosphere from      friction with air molecules. On certain nights of each      year, our planet passes through concentrations of meteoric      material believed to be particles from the dust tails of      comets. When this happens, increased numbers of meteors      streak out of the skies from what appears to be a single      point (a <em>radiant).</em> We call this phenomenon a      meteor shower, and have named the major annual showers for      the constellations from which they seem to originate.    </p>    <p>      This year, only one of the major showers-November's      <em>Taurids--will</em> be entirely obscured by bright      moonlight. Most of the others will provide excellent      viewing-given, of course, cloudless skies and viewing sites      well away from city lights.    </p>    <p>      The <em>Quadrantid</em> meteors are most likely to come in      greatest numbers-no more than a few dozen per hour usually,      but sometimes far more-from the northeast before dawn on      January 3. The <em>Lyrid</em> meteors (about 10 an hour,      most years) will zoom out of the northeast in the late      evening on April 21 before moonrise.The <em>Eta      Aquarids</em> come from the southeast before dawn at rates      of 10 or more per hour at their best; look for them at      their peak around May 3 or 4. The <em>Delta Aquarids</em>      (at best, several dozen an hour or more) will glide out of      the south after mid-night moonsets in the last few nights      of July. The normal ly spectacular <em>Perseids</em>      (August 11 to 13) will be partially dimmed by moonlight      this year, but they may still offer dozens of meteors per      hour well after midnight to lucky country observers. On      October 20 and 21, the <em>Orionids</em> will streak from      the south before dawn at rates of 25 or more per hour in      very dark, clear skies. The <em>Leonids</em> will come from      the south before dawn on November 16 and 17; this year,      they may come in greater than their usual numbers of five      or 10 an hour. And finally, the <em>Geminids</em> should be      excellentup to 50 or more per hour on December 13 or 14      before late-night moonrises.    </p>    <p>      The brightest comet predicted to return in 1990 is our      frequent visitor Comet Encke, which should be making one of      its best returns and will be easily visible in small      telescopes. Check astronomy magazines (such as Sky &      Telescope and <em>Astronomy)</em> throughout the year for      updates on when and where Comet Encke will be appearing in      the skies for viewing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mercury,</strong> our solar system's innermost      planet, is visible only in twilight and only for periods of      a few weeks a small number of times each year. In 1990 your      best chance to see the planet at dusk will be around April      13; your second best chance should come around December 5.      Early risers, on the other hand, should mark September 24      on their calendars as their best opportunity to see Mercury      at dawn. Mercury will have close but low and      hard-to-observe conjunctions (meetings) on February 3 (with      Saturn) and on July 28 (with the star Regulus).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Venus</strong> outshines all other stars and      planets in the heavens whenever it's visible. As 1990      opens, the planet offers us its last few weeks of      visibility as evening star. Steadily held binoculars should      reveal Venus in a skinny crescent phase as it approaches      us. After its closest approach on January 18, when the      planet's position between Earth and the sun will make it      invisible to us, Venus will move west of the sun and, a few      weeks later, appear low in the east before dawn. As the      morning star, Venus will reach greatest brilliancy on      February 22 and greatest elongation-its farthest point from      the sun, as viewed from Earth-on March 30. Unfortunately,      it won't be favorably high for viewing. Although this is      mostly a poor year for U.S. observers of Venus, the planet      will have a striking (but low) conjunction with Jupiter on      August 12 and 13 and with the moon (first on March 23, and      again on August 18).    </p>    <p>      Also, if all goes well, two U.S. spacecraft will visit      Venus in 1990. The <em>Galileo</em> spacecraft, en route to      a 1995 encounter with Jupiter, will zoom by Venus (using it      for a gravitational boost) on about February 9. And on      August 10 the <em>Magellan</em> spacecraft will go into      orbit around Venus, beginning a long study that will      include detailed radar mapping. The observations should      help answer many questions about this hot, eternally      clouded planet-including whether Venus does have volcanoes      (as is strongly suspected) and whether it ever had oceans      before its runaway greenhouse effect altered the planet's      climate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Earth</strong> comes closest to the sun      (perihelion) on January 4 and will be farthest from the sun      (aphelion) on July 4. This year is also the one year in      which Earth will be visited by a spacecraft from Venus . .      . a returning Earth spacecraft, that is! After it has      gathered a gravitational boost from Venus, <em>Galileo      will</em> twice get similar boosts from Earth before racing      out on its way to Jupiter. The Earth encounters will occur      on December 8 this year and on December 8 in 1992, and they      promise to be fascinating. Among other things,      <em>Galileo</em> will check for ancient ice in polar      craters on the moon that    </p>    <p>      I have <em>never</em> received direct sunlight, and will      try to take the first-ever movie of an entire Earth      rotation!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mars</strong> returns in 1990 to great naked-eye      brilliance and respectable telescopic-viewing size after an      "off" year. Although the planet won't come nearly as close      to Earth as it did in the extraordinary approach of 1988,      this will be an exciting year to watch it-the best until      2001. Mars will have close conjunctions with Saturn,      Uranus, and Neptune in February dawns, but only the pairing      with Saturn at month's end will be plainly visible to the      unaided eye. Then the planet will head rapidly north up the      zodiac. On June 30 it will reach its closest point to the      sun in space, but Earth will continue to get closer to      Mars, and Mars will continue to appear brighter, all summer      long. By September the red planet (it's really a golden      orange hue) will be rising before midnight in Taurus,      outshining all stars but Sirius. Still brightening, Mars      will linger in this northerly part of the zodiac and then      begin retrograde motion (appearing to move westward against      the background of stars) on October 20. For the next two      months Mars will be virtually as high in the sky as it ever      appears to U.S. observers, and will brighten to a marvelous      magnitude - 2 in the second half of November. Mars will      reach opposition-the point at which Earth is aligned      between the planet and the sun-on November 27, remaining      visible all    </p>    <p>      night long.The planet will actually come closest to us      (about 48 million miles away) on November 20, when it will      also appear biggest when viewed with telescopes.    </p>    <p>      The final two months of 1990 will also bring striking      conjunctions of Mars and the moon. Look for the imposingly      bright, ruddy planet close to a nearly full moon on the      evenings of November 4, December 1, and December 28.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Jupiter</strong> comes to opposition usually the      best time to view a planet-about every 13 months.      Unfortunately, 1990 is an example of the one year in      Jupiter's 12-year orbit when it doesn't come to opposition.      Nonetheless, it will be <em>almost</em> at its best in both      January and December.    </p>    <p>      The only time Jupiter will not be visible at all this year      will be during a few weeks around July 15 when it reaches      conjunction with the sun (the point at which a planet is on      the opposite side of the sun from Earth). Just before then,      it will appear prominently in the evening in Gemini; just      afterward, it will enter the predawn sky in Cancer each      morning until rising before midnight again late in the      year. Jupiter will have a close (but      lowin-morning-twilight) conjunction with Venus on August 12      and 13 and will have a number of close encounters with the      moon, including lovely pairings with lunar cres cents on      June 23 (evening) and September 15 (morning).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Saturn</strong> will shine in Sagittarius all year      but will be too close to the sun to see for most of      January. After its conjunctions with Mercury and Mars (on      the mornings of February 3, and February 28 to March 1,      respectively), the most beautiful of all the ringed planets      will rise ever earlier and brighter in the night sky.      Saturn will begin retrograde motion on May 5 and will reach      opposition-rising at sunset-on July 14. Low in the south,      golden Saturn will be at its brightest, rivaling the most      brilliant summer stars. Even a small telescope will reveal      the planet's glorious rings, tilted somewhat less than they      have been in recent years. Interestingly, Jupiter will be      at conjunction on the far side of the sun the day after      Saturn's opposition, so the two largest planets in the      solar system will be on almost exactly opposite sides, with      the sun and Earth aligned almost directly between them.    </p>    <p>      Saturn will halt its retrograde motion and begin direct      (west to east) motion on September 23, after which it will      remain prominent in the southwest sky after dusk for a few      more months before becoming obscured by evening twilight      late in the year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Uranus will</strong> pull slightly closer to slower      Neptune in Sagittarius (both of them somewhat west of      Saturn) this year. The planet, rolling around its orbit on      its side and circled by at least 15 moons and a number of      dark rings, is making slow but steady progress toward an      unprecedented event that will take place in 1993: the first      UranusNeptune conjunctions the human race has ever seen!    </p>    <p>      You can view Uranus with binoculars or even with the naked      eye on a moonless country night if you have a good finder      chart such as those in the <em>Astronomical Calendar.</em>      Best viewing should be around the time Uranus reaches      opposition, on June 29.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pluto</strong> was at its closest to the sun for      the first time in 248 years just last September. But its      closest approach to Earth-a little less than 2.7 billion      miles away-will occur around the time of its opposition      <em>this</em> year. Unfortunately, that opposition will      fall on May 7, near a full moon that will obscure the view.      But you can't really expect to glimpse this dim world, even      on moonless nights in April or May, unless you have at      least a six-inch to 10-inch telescope, country skies, and      detailed finder charts. Pluto is thought to be only about      1,460 miles widesmaller than our own moon and less than      half of Mercury's width. The only known planet that has not      been photographed close up by a spacecraft, Pluto is known      to have a moon (dubbed Charon) that's over half as big as      Pluto itself-and only 12,400 miles from its mother planet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Neptune made front-page</strong> news last August      when <em>Voyager</em> 2 gave us our first close-up look at      this blue world and its assortment of at least eight major      moons and mysterious rings. In addition to revealing a      clumpy, moon-studded ring and many unusual cloud features      (including the Earth-sized Great Dark Spot),      <em>Voyager</em> 2 showed us the solar system's strangest      moon: pink and blue and dazzling white Triton, with its ice      volcanoes and remarkable hodgepodge of terrain. If the      Hubble Space Telescope is put into Earth orbit by the space      shuttle this spring as planned, it should be powerful      enough to provide more views of the Great Dark Spot. Back      here on Earth, though, ground-based observers with      relatively small telescopes must settle for glimpsing      Neptune as a blue dot or point of light. To do so, you'll      need detailed finder charts and a clear, moonless, country      night. Look for Neptune in Sagittarius between Saturn and      Uranus; best viewing should be around the time of      opposition on July 5.    </p>    <p>      Incidentally, Neptune became our most distant planet in      1979 and will remain so until 1999, when Pluto, now      traveling away from us, will swing out beyond Neptune's      orbit and regain its position (to be held for roughly the      next 230 years) as most distant planet.    </p>    <p>      The red plane, Mars, will shine with uncommon brilliance in      the night skies this summer and fall.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EVENTS FOR 1990</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>When and where to watch the skies.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>One star indicates the event is of special      interest; two indicate even higher interest.</strong>    </p>        <p class="caption">      <strong>One of nature's most amazing sights: clouds of      shifting, dancing colors, known as the northern lights or      aurora borealis.
