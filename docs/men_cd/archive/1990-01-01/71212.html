                        <p>      <strong>GLISTENING ICICLES DANGLING</strong> from the eaves      may be among the beauties of winter, but they can also be a      sign of trouble for your home. Icicle formation is often a      symptom of ice damming, a serious condition that can ruin      the roofing, the sheathing below, the rafters and joists      that support the roof, the insulation, the paint on the      exterior walls, and even the interior finish of your home.    </p>    <p>      Ice damming occurs when snow melts on a warm area of roof      and flows downslope until it refreezes on a colder area      near the eaves. Subsequent meltwater then pools above the      icy obstruction and does its dirty work. Because most      residential roofing systems are designed to shed water, not      to seal it out, pooled water can leak up under shingles or      around panel-roof seams, penetrating the sheathing and      damaging non-weatherresistant materials below.    </p>    <p>      Major ice damming is seldom the result of natural, daily      freeze-thaw cycles. It is almost always caused when heat      lost from the house melts snow on the roof. Warmth leaks      from the interior, passing through a poorly ventilated      attic (or cathedral ceiling) to the roof (Fig. 1). At the      same time, portions of the roof that extend beyond the      living areaoverhangs, soffits, porch roofs-remain cold and      thus refreeze the melt descending from above. It's the      difference in surface temperature that causes the problem.      Roofs that are all cold or all warm do not get ice dams.    </p>    <h3>Right Remedies</h3>    <p>      Now that we understand why ice dams happen, let's look at      ways to cure them. There are three common methods of      attack: Keep the entire roof cold by reducing heat loss      from the house; keep the entire roof cold by venting heat      loss before it can warm the roof; or keep the entire roof      warm by heating the periphery. From an energy standpoint,      the first approach obviously is the most attractive. (Roof      ventilation has other arguable merits. In fact, it may be      required by building code. But it is not a good sole      solution to ice damming.) Therefore, we need to determine      why so much heat is escaping from the house-and the most      effective way to prevent it.    </p>    <p>      Insufficient or deteriorated attic insulation can lead to      ice damming. If your house lacks up insulation in the roof,      or if the R-value is below the guidelines shown in Fig. 2,      by all means add insulation. You should also inspect      existing insulation to ensure that it fits snugly between      the ceiling joists and that it does not touch the roof      rafters.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>How to prevent and cure damaging roof-ice build      .</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      However, according to Gary Nelson, president of Minneapolis      Blower Door Company and an experienced researcher in home      weatherization, major dams are more often caused by air      leakage from the house into the attic or cathedral ceiling      than by poor insulation. Air currents carry heat to the      underside of the roof much more readily than does radiation      through the air or conduction through contiguous materials.      Thus a house with a very well insulated but leaky ceiling      may still have problems with ice dams.    </p>    <p>      Often, the house will tell you a story about the problem if      you step outside and inspect the pattern of snowmelt on the      roof.    </p>    <p>      Insulation-related ice dams are usually pretty pervasive,      because heat lost by this path is dispersed, spreading the      problem over much of the roof surface. A typical warm-attic      pattern will have wide stripes of melt, with narrow      unmelted areas above each rafter. Air leakage-related ice      dams, on the other hand, are often localized, because warm      air blows directly onto the underside of the roof in      specific locations. (Nelson refers to this observational      technique as "poor man's infrared imaging.")    </p>    <p>      Gary has found that there are two areas where air commonly      leaks into attics: places where the ceiling changes height,      and holes through which various services pass. Examples of      the former include lowered ceilings in closets, soffits      above cabinets (such as in the kitchen), ceiling junctions      in split-level houses, ceilings above stairwells, knee      walls in second-story rooms, and drop ceilings over bathtub      enclosures. Holes might include plumbing walls that are      unsealed at the top, oversize holes for vent stacks that go      through a top plate, a missing or leaky attic hatch, air      gaps around chimneys, exhaust fans that have loose ducts or      that vent directly into the attic, recessed lights, furnace      ducts, a wholehouse fan, and built-in vacuum-cleaner ducts.    </p>    <p>      A careful attic inspection will usually reveal the major      leaks. Before going into the attic, note the locations of      interior partition walls, so you can inspect from above      their junctions with the ceiling. Once in the attic, look      for telltale black stains and mildew (or even frost in      winter) on the underside of the roof sheathing; air leaks      are likely to be found directly below such evidence.      Similarly, the tops of ceiling joists may be stained      adjacent to a leak. Watch for areas of dust accumulation on      insulation bans or loose fill. Large volumes of moving air      will carry dust, and quite a bit of it will attach to      fibrous materials. If furnace-supply or returnair ducts      pass through the attic, inspect them carefully and retape      all joints.    </p>    <p>      Plug air leaks with caulk, foam sealant, well-caulked rigid      insulation board, or even insulation-filled plastic bags      shoved into the gaps. And don't underestimate the power      exerted by buoyant warm air. Unsupported polyethylene      sheeting is often unable to withstand the air pressure      found at the ceiling in a multistory home, so be sure to      back the plastic with plywood or insulation board.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>To find the air leak, use "poor man's infrared      imaging study the snowmelt on the roof.</em></strong>    </p>    <h3>Other Cures</h3>    <p>      While a warm roof is the only actual cause of ice damming,      there are several other construction features that may      influence the likelihood of dams forming. Roofs with steep      slopes, for example, may shed snow before it has a chance      to melt and refreeze. Likewise, drifts are more likely to      slide from a smooth metal roof than from a rough shingled      one. The orientation and color of the roof may also affect      the likelihood of a dam occurring. Roof surfaces that face      the sun may warm to above freezing even on a day when the      air temperature remains below 32Â°F. Furthermore, once      enough snow has melted to expose the roof to the sun,      darker colors may speed melting.    </p>             <p>      <strong><em>Ice buildup along the edges of a roof is more      often caused by air leaking from the house than by      inadequate insulation levels.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Most of these factors are of interest only to those      designing a new home, but a technique based on one of them      is often employed on existing homes, particularly in the      Northeast. Metal roofing is installed from the eaves to      three or four feet up the roof slope, above which point      less-expensive shingles are used. The smooth metal is less      likely than shingles to let ice accumulate, and it's also      better able to withstand the stress when ice does form.    </p>    <p>      One common approach to eliminating ice damming is to      install a grid of electrical heating wire along the eaves.      Though certainly effective, such an array must be kept on      throughout the winter, using a considerable amount of      electricity. What's more, the gutters and downspouts must      also be wired to prevent the runoff from freezing within      them.    </p>    <p>      Attic ventilation is often cited as a cure for ice damming,      since it prevents heat lost from the house into the attic      from warming the roof. Well-insulated, properly designed      new homes frequently have attic venting problems, because      insulation near the outer walls fills the space between the      top plate and the roof sheathing, obstructing the air path      between the rafters. Careful insulation installation or      specially made spacers can solve this problem. Bear in      mind, however, that attic ventilation isn't really a      solution to ice damming; it's just a bandage.    </p>    <p>      As a last-ditch measure, in a situation where you just      can't address the problem directly or even by ventilation,      consider installing a waterproof membrane below the roofing      in the area where ice dam-related leaks are occurring. This      protective layer consists of three-foot-wide rolls of      polyethylene sheeting coated with rubberized asphalt. The      adhesive-backed material selfseals below the roofing and      prevents water that does leak through the roof from      reaching degradable materials below.    </p>    <p>      If at all possible, though, don't settle for attacking      symptoms. When you fix an icedamming problem the right      way-by blocking off the source of heat that causes snow on      the roof to melt-you reap multiple benefits. Not only does      your home stop rotting, but your heating bills will drop      dramatically.    </p>
