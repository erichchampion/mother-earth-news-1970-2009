        R-values are a measure of a material's resistance to heat; thehigher the value, the better the insulative properties. Althoughthey are a convenient and common yardstick to measure thermalperformance, the usefulness of them is limited.<br /><br />In a <a href="http://www.thermapan.com/pdf/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">2000study</a> by Brock University in Ontario, two almost identicalhomes ? one built with a stick frame and the other with StructuralInsulated Panels (SIPs) ? were compared for energy efficiency.Thermal analysis revealed the 2-by-6 stick frame house (rated atR-20) performed at an R-4 equivalent, while the 4 1/2-inch-wide SIPhome performed at a true R-17 level in 13-degreetemperatures.<br /><br />The reason for the wide discrepancy is because, unlike framesystems, SIPs offer continuous insulation values across large areasof airtight walls, unbroken by studs that would otherwise conductheat and let cold air into the building. In terms of real-worldenergy conservation, the SIPs home consumed only a quarter as muchenergy over one year as its stick-built counterpart, even thoughR-value ratings were comparable.
