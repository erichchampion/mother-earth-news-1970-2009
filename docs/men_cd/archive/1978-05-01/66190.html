                      <p>      From <em>Creating Alternative Futures: The End of      Economics</em> by Hazel Henderson, copyright 1978 by      Princeton Center for Alternative Futures, Inc., and      reprinted by permission of Berkley Publishing Corporation,      200 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y. 10016. Available in      paperback ($4.95) from any good bookstore.    </p>		<hr />		<p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy has called Hazel Henderson "a    unique contemporary pioneer in the effort to humanize modern    science and technology".</p>    <p>      E.F. Schumacher once stated, "Mrs. Henderson's      essays-every one of them-have more 'reality'      than almost any other writings on societal problems I      know."    </p>    <p>      And Jacques-Yves Cousteau has said of Hazel Henderson's      collected writings, "in this book are most of the ideas we      are fighting for. Anybody longing for a better life must      read it."    </p>    <p>      And just who is this Hazel Henderson that all these people      are talking about? She's an internationally published      thinker, activist, and a founder of many public interest      (particularly environmental) organizations . . . who,      perhaps, sees things more clearly than most of today's      Establishment "leaders" because she's never attended a day      of college in her life.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore-with her husband, Carter F.      Henderson-Hazel currently directs the Princeton      Center for Alternative Futures, Inc. . . . a deliberately      small and independent think tank.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Henderson is also a director of the Council on      Economic Priorities and of the Worldwatch Institute, a      member of the U.S. Association for the Club of Rome, an      advisor to The Cousteau Society and to the Environmental      Action Foundation, and a member of the Advisory Council of      the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment.    </p>    <p>      And here-for those of you not already acquainted with      her provocative point of view-is a sampling from Mrs.      Henderson's newly published collected writings:      <em>Creating Alternative Futures.</em>    </p>    <p>      There are many signs, both physical and metaphysical, that      industrial cultures are breaking down. But I want to      emphasize that the breakdown of an old culture can also      signify a needed breakthrough. Times of crisis, as the      Chinese say, are times of both danger and opportunity.    </p>    <p>      From ecological theory, we know that all biological systems      (including human societies and those abstractions they call      their "economies") involve continuous cycles of entropy and      syntropy: the breaking down and building up of structure      and the constant recycling of the detritus that releases      the nutrients for new growth, synthesis, and evolution. So      let us now look at what is being born: the emerging,      regenerative, "counter-economy" now beginning to grow amid      the old industrial systems.    </p>    <p>      This basic model of the entropy/syntropy cycle and the      irreversible evolution of all natural and biological      systems is crucial to our understanding of the particular      subsystem we call our "economy" and in helping us see      current economic difficulties in longer time perspectives      as the onset of the decline of industrialism.    </p>    <p>      This decline will undoubtedly prove uncomfortable, as it      already is for the millions of unemployed in mature      industrial countries. But it will only affect the      unsustainable modes of production and consumption it has      fostered. With leadership and foresight, adjustments can be      made without severe consequences.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile the declining system is already releasing      "nutrients": capital, management, and human energy and      initiative . . . which are spurring the development of this      already visible counter-economy, now beginning to flourish      in the interstices of our existing institutions.    </p>    <p>      While economists struggle to recycle themselves in order to      address these new conditions and unfamiliar variables, it      seems to those whose vision has remained unclouded by      economists' mystification that this transition is obvious,      that it can be inferred from extremely simple metaphors;      e.g., "There is no such thing as a free lunch", "Nothing      fails like success", "Growth can be cancer". Indeed,      average citizens in these societies have learned to tune      out their leaders and mass media and are well on their way      to understanding the true situation, in spite of the      obfuscations of legions of intellectual day laborers and      the divinations of "experts".    </p>        <p>      In fact, it is fairly self-evident that these mature      industrial societies could not continue expanding at past      <em>rates,</em> simply because such rates are always in      relation to the size of a base. Any citizen knows that as a      base grows, the rate of its expansion must sooner or later      decline . . . whether one is looking at the rate of      increase of today's shares in IBM or Xerox, compared with      their past spectacular performance . . . or the rate of      growth in the size of oil tankers, airplanes, or human      settlements. In fact, the only current exception to this      rule appears to be bureaucracies, but they too may decline      like the over-centralized, unsustainable technologies that      gave rise to them.    </p>    <p>      And yet, I still find a great deal of hand wringing and      rubbish talked in Washington today, about falling rates of      economic growth (GNP-defined) and falling <em>rates</em> of      technological innovation and "productivity" (inadequately      defined), where the base for calculating such      rates-the giant U.S. socio-technical system-is      the largest on the planet! Surely we know by now that human      cultures have a habit of rising and then declining as they      exceed some resource limit, run out of technological      adaptability, or simply lose creative steam.    </p>    <p>      So I am not impressed when U.S. rates of technological      innovation and "productivity" are compared with official      horror to the higher rates of Japan (with a postwar base      about an order of magnitude smaller than our own). I am not      upset when I'm warned that new "science and technology      gaps" are widening and when Congress is urged by science      and high-technology-promoting groups to appropriate ever      more tax dollars to save us from this fate. Their      underlying assumption in all these exhortations is that the      health of the scientific and technological enterprise, as      currently defined and constituted, is coterminous with the      health of the country as a whole. I and many others reject      this proposition.    </p>    <p>      Far from being faddish, the counterculture and      citizen-protest movements of the past decade that are      forming the nucleus of the emerging      counter-economies-based on self-reliant,      decentralized, ecologically harmonious lifestyles-are      deadly serious. These movements must be explicitly      documented and reinforced, since they represent the best      repositories of social and cultural flexibility during the      decline now underway in many mature industrial countries .      . . the decline which points to a coming contraction in our      system of world trade.    </p>        <p>      The evolutionary dilemma summarized by the aphorism      "Nothing fails like success" can be restated in terms of      anthropology as the Law of the Retarding Lead, which holds      that the best adapted and most successful countries have      the greatest difficulty in adapting and retaining their      lead in world affairs, and-conversely-that the      backward and less successful societies are more likely to      be able to adapt and forge ahead under changing conditions.    </p>    <p>      L.S. Stavrianos uses these principles to argue in his book,      <em>The Promise of the Coming Dark Age</em> , that on the      crowded, ecologically depleted planet of today, Western      societies must flounder. On the other hand, says      Stavrianos, there is the possibility of synthesizing unique      development strategies by adapting from the Chinese      communal model of self-reliant development and      mass-participation, from the Yugoslavian model of worker      self-management, and from the counterculture,      citizen-action, community-control models now developing in      the counter-economies being born in the Western industrial      countries.    </p>    <p>      If Western societies are to become regenerative and      sustainable, they indeed may have to learn from these      so-called less developed countries . . . as well as      relearning much traditional wisdom and skill from their own      pasts.    </p>    <p>      In the face of the current transition of industrial      societies and the efforts at reconceptualizing the new      situation, it's not surprising that levels of cognitive      dissonance are increasing. In the U.S., in spite of a      decade of predictions of their transience, we see the      durability of the counterculture, the environmental      movement (now stronger than ever), consumer and      public-interest advocacy, and the women's liberation and      minority-rights movement-as well as the diffusion of      new values and new lifestyle options brought about by these      trends-while statistics document the reverse      migration from cities back to rural areas.    </p>    <p>      In any period of cultural transition, the dominant organs      of a society often increase their efforts to reassure the      public, while their leaders privately express doubt and      fear. This is not surprising, since it is precisely these      institutions of government, business, academia, labor, and      religion which are in decline and whose power is threatened      and eroding. The information-gathering and -disseminating      media, the statistics, and the indicators are all geared to      measure the society's well-being <em>in terms</em> of the      well-being of these existing institutions. Therefore, the      growing shoots of the society go unmeasured and are      overlooked and will remain insufficiently monitored and      studied as new social models.    </p>    <p>      Some of the most interesting and significant manifestations      of the <em>counter</em> -economies in the U.S., Canada, the      United Kingdom, the Scandinavian countries, the      Netherlands, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, include:    </p>		<p>•The growth of counter-media and alternative publishing (a    measuring rod of the counter-economy) . . . for example, in    the U.S.: Prevention (nearly 2 million circulation), Organic    Gardening (1 million), Rolling Stone (600,000), THE MOTHER    EARTH NEWS (restricted) " (550,000), and The Whole Earth Catalog and    Epilog; the proliferation of regional magazines dealing with    ecological lifestyles and appropriate technology; the 80-some    publishing ventures operated by feminists; the rise of the    black press; and the hundreds of small, often cooperatively    owned book publishers and distributors.<br />•The alternative    marketing enterprises . . for example: the <em>Alternative    Christmas Catalog</em> , which offers-instead of    materialistic goods and junk gifts-a vast selection of    "psychic gifts" such as subscriptions to counterculture    magazines and newsletters and memberships in various    counterculture, public-interest, and citizen organizations;    the growth of organizations that market rural crafts such as    quilts, embroidery, clothes, and toys to urban department    stores, often on a non-profit basis; the alternative    merchandising media now offered to small rural businesses and    crafts by the burgeoning counterculture media with their    inexpensive advertising rates and well-defined audiences;    highly professional alternative opinion-survey firms, such as    American Research Corporation and Hart Associates;    public-interest advertising agencies, the best known of which    in the U.S. is the Public Media Center of San Francisco,    which does not take ordinary commercial clients but sells    citizen organizations and their social causes.<br />•The    development of alternative marketing groups such as Oxfam's    "Bridge" in Britain, which links small, rural producers of    handcrafted goods and art in the Third World with affluent,    concerned consumers in Britain, thus setting up new trading    relationships that operate in a non-profit, people-to-people    mode, avoiding profit-motivated trading channels and    multinational enterprises.</p>    <p>      Another growing idea is that of staging both rural and      urban "fairs", where various sectors of the counter-economy      can nucleate and cross-fertilize. These feature      new-lifestyle speakers, book stalls, booths for local      citizen organizations, and commune-made arts and crafts. An      example is the Toward Tomorrow Fair in Amherst,      Massachusetts, an annual event which features some five      acres of alternative technology exhibits by small      businesses in solar, wind, and bioconversion, flushless      toilets, do-it-yourself housing, and home and garden tools.      The fair, which attracts some 30,000 people, has become an      institution. Similar fairs and festivals, such as The      Cousteau Society's "involvement days" and the many      concerned with improving nutrition and wholistic health,      draw similar crowds. They augur new lateral linkages and      networks, insulated from traditional industrial      merchandising and based on emerging value systems      impervious to the old, materialistic, Madison Avenue "hard      sell".    </p>		<p>•The growing interest in household economics; i.e., the    economics of use-value, rather than market-value. Professor    Sol Tax has proposed in The Center Report that we begin    looking through the other end of the telescope at the    possibilities of the family as the basic corporate unit and,    where necessary, alter our tax structure and laws to favor    this smallest unit of economic and social organization rather    than large corporations, as at present.</p>        <p>      In 1780, over 80% of all Americans were self-employed, many      in household economies. Canada's Vanier Institute for the      Family is dedicated to the concept of household economics      and the promotion of local self-reliance . . . to      decentralizing economic power and exposing the absurdities      of national economic statistics that do not recognize the      enormous productivity of households simply because they are      not-and probably never should be-a part of the      cash-based economy.    </p>    <p>      In Home, Inc., Scott Burns estimates that if our national      statistics were to include the value of households and the      work performed by men and women in them, the total would      equal the entire amount paid out in wages and salaries by      every corporation in the U.S. Burns notes that government      statisticians only value the household when it breaks down;      i.e., they know the cost of welfare, aid to dependent      children, and social services, and thus could      compute-negatively-the value of viable      households. In addition, he notes that while income tax      laws allow corporations to deduct and depreciate items of      capital equipment, householders are forced to treat their      own productive assets-e.g., sewing machines, ovens,      freezers, yogurt makers, and other home tools-as if      they were <em>consumer</em> goods!    </p>    <p>      A 1969 survey measured the total value of all goods and      services produced by the household sector in 1965 as about      8300 billion. The increasing protest at the statistical      blackout perpetrated for so long on the household economy      is, of course, being spearheaded by women, who have been      consistently ignored by economists' definitions of      "productivity" and "value", as well as excluded from the      GNP and their rightful access to retirement security. Many      women fight these terrible injustices by going outside the      home and competing successfully in the market economy,      while others, together with concerned men, fight to restore      the proper place of the family in our economic life and to      strengthen its role in the vital nurturing and socializing      of the young and in maintaining intergeneration cohesion.    </p>    <p>      Many others in the counterculture work to enlarge the      definition of the family to include communes and      intentional families of all kinds, based not only on sex      roles but also on work and companionship. Most of our      economic statistics are devised to plot the market system,      rather than to trace the full and real dimensions of our      total economic system. So far, the sparse academic efforts      to overhaul the GNP to include the value of the household      economy and subtract the soaring social costs of market      activities have never been promoted by the economics      profession, in spite of general acknowledgment of the      glaring errors in GNP measurements of economic growth.    </p>		<p>•The growth of the various movements for alternative    technology. These movements are flourishing in all mature    industrial societies, particularly Britain, the Scandinavian    countries, the U.S., and Canada. There is almost a surfeit of    studies and statistics related to the characteristics of    dominant modes of industrial scientific and technological    development, since technological "productivity" and    technology transfer are issues of keen interest in national    and international trade. However, the emerging economies    based on more culturally and ecologically appropriate    technology have been almost totally ignored by most agencies    of government in the countries where these movements exist.    One can only infer the size of this sector from advertising    linage in alternative media, and from the best-seller status    of its gurus such as Schumacher, whose posthumously published    new book, <em>A Guide for the Perplexed</em> , was eagerly    awaited. While obituaries for Schumacher in the dominant    press were respectful, a groundswell of memorial services and    salutes occurred in many countries.</p>    <p>      Magazines also grow apace in this field, such as Canada's      Alternatives; Britain's <em>The Ecologist, Undercurrents,      Resurgence,</em> and <em>Appropriate Technology;</em> and      Australia's <em>Earth Garden,</em> <em>Grass Roots</em> ,      and <em>The Powder Magazine.</em> In the U.S. are      <em>THE</em> <em><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, Foxfire, Journal of the      New Alchemists, Co-Evolution Quarterly, Rain, Science for      the People, Workforce, Shelter, Self-Reliance</em> , and      scores of others, many of whose ideas emerge-after a      several-year lag-in the more cautious,      Washington-based journal, The Futurist.    </p>		<p>•The rebirth of populism and the cooperative movement,    neighborhood and block development, "sweat equity" urban    renewal, land trusts, and the increased bartering of skills    and home-produced goods and services. The Cooperative League    of the U.S.A., in its 1975 review, stated that more than So    million Americans belonged to cooperatives. These included    co-op banks to provide credit that commercial banks deny,    credit unions, insurance plans, nursery schools, farmers'    marketing co-ops, rural electric coops, student housing    co-ops, rural telephone co-ops, fishing coops, memorial    societies to provide dignified burial rites, and (the most    recent type) food co-ops.</p>    <p>      A bill to establish a national cooperative bank came close      to passage in the 94th Congress-and will probably      pass during the Carter Administration-to help      counteract the discrimination coops have suffered at the      hands of commercial, multinational banks. Many local      organizations are campaigning to set up state-owned      development banks modeled after the successful state Bank      of North Dakota. This will make credit available to      small-scale farmers (whom the U.S. Department of      Agriculture had proposed to consign to oblivion by dropping      them from its statistics). It will also encourage local      community development corporations and co-ops.    </p>    <p>      The Massachusetts Community Development Finance Corporation      may be one of the first in the field. Already authorized,      with an initial appropriation of $10 million, it will buy      stock in enterprises owned in common by the residents of      any area in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, grassroots community      organizations are springing up, many based on the      spectacularly successful model of ACORN in Arkansas-a      coalition of poor homeowners, farmers, sharecroppers,      workers, and urban residents of all races-whose      solidarity has shown how local satrapies controlling      millions of dollars of tax money can be captured by      determined voters who study their own local political      systems carefully. Still other grassroots organizations      have shown how utility rate increases can be fought (and      also reduced, as demonstrated in California and other      states by the Lifeline coalitions).    </p>    <p>      Horrified at the success of these grassroots efforts,      utilities have launched emergency counterattacks in the      form of stepped-up lobbying and advertising (charged to      their customers' bills), while deposed political hacks in      Arkansas and editorials in Little Rock newspapers talked of      "the Lilliputians who banded together and tied down      Gulliver".    </p>    <p>      Not only is it costly, but it demands intellectual      creativity to design new statistics on this cooperative,      neighborhood-based political and economic activity, since      few official measures are available and status quo      institutions often are successful in playing down such      activities or in blacking out the reporting of them in      commercially controlled media.    </p>    <p>      The rising worker-participation and self-management      movements. These are more active in Western Europe and      Canada than in the U.S. or Japan. Western Europe's      political traditions make for easier dissemination and      cohesion of efforts to gain more influence over the quality      of working life. In the U.S. the labor movement has, up to      now, seen more material rewards in traditional bargaining      strategies for higher wages. This attitude is changing,      though, as-under inflation-real incomes have      remained fixed for protracted periods and faltering growth      can no longer assure workers of steady employment.    </p>    <p>      In Japan, worker demands for self-management have been      headed off so far by management's commitments to lifelong      employment and all-embracing welfare benefits. But as the      Japanese economy is weakened by Its raw-material and energy      dependence and reliance on unrealistic levels of exports,      corporate executives are adopting Western-style mass      layoffs. The radicalization of the Japanese labor force      will sooner or later result from this change.    </p>    <p>      Western European countries, such as Sweden, Norway,      Germany, France, and Britain, are making almost daily      accommodations to the pressure from unions. Examples      include Sweden's Meidner Plan to substantially shift the      ownership of Swedish industries to their workers, Germany's      worker-management parity on boards of steel companies, and      the milder forms of job enrichment that are becoming      commonplace.    </p>    <p>      U.S. management is well aware of the radical implications      of these experiments. In some cases-as workers have      successfully organized production, achieved productivity      gains, and worked out salary differentials in their own      committees-they gain the confidence to ask the taboo      question, "What are all these managers doing . . . aren't      they just featherbedders?" At this point, many of the      experiments are quietly discontinued, since the workers are      challenging "the divine right of management". In Britain,      this issue-which underlies the ancient war between      labor and capital-has erupted into class warfare,      while the model for worker self-management experimentation      may be Yugoslavia, where the concept of private property is      similar to that of our own founding fathers.    </p>		<p>•The resurgence of ethnic and indigenous peoples all over    the planet. This phenomenon requires further study. Such    populations are beginning to recognize the inability of    metropolitan centers to meet their needs, and to determine    that the exploitative relationships from which they suffer    must be openly resisted and severed. From the extraordinary    secret "summit" meeting which was held in Trieste in 1975 by    the oppressed ethnic minorities of Europe-with its    vision of a "Europe of Peoples"-to the American Indian    Movement in the U.S. and the demands of Canada's native    residents of the Yukon and Northwest Territories for the    return of their lands, these manifestations are widespread.</p>    <p>      Many of the goals of these ethnic peoples are similar to      those of the counterculture and citizen-action movements:      curbing the excesses of the profit system, creating new      principles of balance and accountability of both corporate      and bureaucratic power and wealth, making science and      technology serve democratically determined social and human      goals, decentralizing decision making and public access to      information and government, ending discrimination based on      race and sex, and drawing on the wisdom of traditional      cultures to redesign lifestyles harmonious with each other      and with nature.    </p><p>•The global ecology movement and the feminist movement.    Both are playing unique roles in social transformation, since    they operate within the mainstream of our culture. The    male-dominated industrial societies find it impossible not to    deal with either, as the wives of corporate and government    bureaucrats become their uncomfortable social "consciences",    while many male executives must face their own children to    defend ecologically or socially destructive decisions.<br /> •The    building of new coalitions in industrial countries between    formerly fragmented citizens' groups. I have noted in earlier    articles how formerly disparate local groups operated in the    1960's in the U.S.: Some fought air pollution in New York and    California and some tried to clean up local rivers or to stop    roads or airports, but with little knowledge of each other's    activities. Only after Earth Day in 1970 was there a    convergence and a quantum leap in the conceptualization of    their fragmented problems of "pollution" as protection of the    environment and the planetary biosphere.</p>        <p>      Similar convergences occurred around the concept of      corporate accountability. Consumer and environmental      advocates and members of civil rights, women's, and student      movements joined with antiwar groups and with media-access,      freedom-of-information, and counterculture forces. All had      found that the targets of their grievances were, among      other things, the practices of large corporations. Today's      coalitions bring together many of these existing forces,      along with new and older elements of the labor movement,      rural voters, small business people and farmers, grassroots      and neighborhood groups, and appropriate-technology      advocates.    </p>    <p>      These coalitions are nothing more than consumer demand      (that cannot be expressed in the marketplace) for mass      transit, solar and wind energy, recycling, and      bioconversion industries . . . the growing edge of the      regenerative, sustainable economy. Their political efforts      will begin to shift the pattern of investment to underpin      these new sectors of the economy, just as they created the      pollution control industries and our current $50 million      solar industry.    </p>    <p>      Those for whom the status quo is still providing      comfortable livings and meaningful lives are naturally      impatient at the citizen movements, the public-interest      advocates, and the counter-economy's fumbling efforts to      articulate its visions with cohesion, to innovate      technology, to gain access to media, markets, credit      sources, and government contracts. Futurists' scenario      building and hypothesizing and explorations of values are      also scoffed at for their lack of "rigor" by comfortable      academicians who are well rewarded for their orthodoxies.      Yet in the future even learning will be less      institutionalized and more entrepreneurial, whether in the      renewed interest in apprenticeship and interning or in the      learning that will more often occur in the workplace as a      result of the development of more communal and enriching      production modes.    </p>    <p>      I confess that I am a member of the counter-economy myself.      The past decade of my life has been spent in citizen-action      movements, public-interest groups, and social change. I am      self-employed and already operate a family corporation. We      have reduced our material expectations and our corporate      income in order not to serve those corporations whose      values we reject. We have no income security or group      pension plan, but-on the plus side-we do not      need to commute to work but live by the natural cycles of      sun and seasons, and-best of all-we have the      freedom to think and write what we please, without      institutional constraints.    </p>    <p>      The decline of industrialism, while upsetting to many power      wielders, is a heady (if insecure) time for many of us. To      share our sense of awakening and rebirth, old intellectual,      emotional, and financial investments will have to be      written off, while personal risks will be required. Yet      even those who choose to remain industrialism's managers or      intellectual servants to the old system will no doubt have      to lower their own goals or material acquisition and accept      less job security, tenure, and pension benefits.    </p>    <p>      There is, after all, a very appropriate personal trade-off      between striving for greater secular power and wealth and      ego gratification, and taking the path toward expanded      consciousness. Those of us in the counter-economy have      opted for the latter . . . and consider it a bargain.    </p>
