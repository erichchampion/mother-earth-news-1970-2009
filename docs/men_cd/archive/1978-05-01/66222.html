               	 <hr />	 <p>      The following declaration originally appeared in the      February 11, 1978 edition of Environmental Action, the      bi-weekly publication of Environmental Action, Inc., 1346      Connecticut Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. A one-year      subscription to the periodical is $15 ($10 for students or      those over 65, $30 for profitmaking institutions), and      includes a year's membership in the organization. EA is      also distributing "solar consciousness-raising" kits. Send      an SASE for details.    </p>    <p>      When in the Course Of Energy Development, it becomes      necessary for a people to dissolve the technological and      political Bonds which have connected them to dwindling      sources of dangerous, polluting energy controlled by a few      corporations and to embrace a decentralized plentiful      clean, and renewable source of energy more compatible with      the Laws of Nature and out Democracy, a decent respect to      the opinions of<br />      Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which      impel them to the transition.<br />    </p>    <p>      We hold these truths to be self-evident:    </p>    <p>      That solar energy-including sunlight, wind,      biological matter, and failing water-is a natural,      renewable, and relatively non-polluting resouce;    </p>    <p>      That solar technologies, which function best on a small,      decentralized scale must not be monopolized of economically      controlled by any group;    </p>    <p>      That, in addition to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of      Happiness, all people are entitled to a place in the sun,      and that reasonable solar access may not be denied without      due process of Law or just compensation;    </p>    <p>      That any attempts to purchase new solar inventions in order      to suppress them of delay their use are wrong and must      prevented;<br />    </p>    <p>      That no utility companyshould unfairly raise rates or      otherwise discriminate against customers who substitute      solar energy for power the utility supplies;    </p>    <p>      That the government must consider using solar energy in all      of its construction, purchasing, lending, or other      activities affecting energy use;    </p>    <p>      That a solar economy, which will provide millions more jobs      than will "conventional" power production, can only      flourish if taxing and spending policies at all levels of      government are changed to assist rather than hinder the      solar industry and solar users;<br />    </p>    <p>      That all solar users must be shielded from unfair losses      through reasonable warranties, minimum standards, and other      consumer protection measures.    </p>    <p>      Prudence will dictate that energy systems long established      should not be changed for light<br />      and transient causes; and experience has shown that mankind      is more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,      than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which      they are accustomed. But when a long train of abusses and      usurpations threatens to fatally harm both the environment      and the economy, it is our right, it is our duty, to throw      off such an Energy System, and to provide new guards for      out future security.    </p>    <p>      The history of the present energy system is a history of      repeated injuries and usurpations all having the direct      effect of establishing energy control by the few over the      many. To prove this, let facts be submitted to the world:    </p>    <p>      By virtue of their immense wealth and size, the energy      companies have achieved an economic and political power      greater than each of the fifty states and many nations;    </p>    <p>      Our air is fouled with noxious fumes and our waters are      spoiled with oily slime and poisons;    </p>    <p>      Our safety is threatened by the radiation of nuclear      fission, and out liberty by its potential for terrorist      use;    </p>    <p>      The majestic mountains of Appalachia and the bounteous      plains o f America have been desolated by strip mining;    </p>    <p>      The import of foreign oil leads us to bankruptcy and the      tyranny of OPEC;<br />    </p>    <p>      Because of unparalleled centralization and huge capital      outlays that produce few jobs, the<br />      energy companies have constricted jogs growth;    </p>    <p>      We, therefore the people of the United estates of America,      do solemnly publish and declare that we are, and of Right      ought to be, Free and Independent from non-renewable energy      systems controlled by a few corporations, and we declare a      new energy order dependent upon solar and other      decentralized, renewable energy systems.    </p>		 <hr />    <p>      *Environmental Action calls the above a "Declaration of      Solar Independence"; but MOTHER thinks it makes more sense      this way. The EA folks-good people that they      are-say they don't care what we call it, as long as      we help spread the word!    </p>
