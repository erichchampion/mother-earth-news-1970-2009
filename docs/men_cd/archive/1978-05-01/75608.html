            					 <hr />     <p>    <em>As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen    and Scott Nearing are light years ahead of most of us when it    comes to getting back to the land and living a life of    voluntary simplicity. As well they should be, since they    originally homesteaded a run-down farm in Vermont's Green    Mountains away back in the autumn of 1932.</em></p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky- inlet on the coast of ,Maine and start all over      again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the leavings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and Scott are famous for their stone houses), and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably- productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly SO Years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one/, the Hearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they've      agreed to share some of that knowledge with if OTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE .<span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) P.O. Box      70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The most important and      most frequently, asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we all cart read what      the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>        <p>      My wife and I expect to buy some land soon and begin      subsistence farming on our own, despite our lack of farming      experience. Have you any general advice for people about to      embark upon such an "adventure"?    </p>    <p>      Your plunge into a new lifestyle may be too sudden. We      would suggest careful preparation before you act:    </p>    <p>      [1] Don't get into debt. Have enough money set aside      <em>before</em> you make the move to live on for at least      three years.    </p>    <p>      [2] Read up carefully and thoroughly on all aspects of      organic gardening and farming.    </p>    <p>      [3] Apprentice yourselves to an experienced farmer,      preferably a neighbor. Continue to work for him/her gratis      (or nearly so) for as long as you are <em>learning</em>      something worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      [4] If possible, associate with other people who are      interested in getting-or who already are-into      subsistence farming. Get advice from them.    </p>    <p>      [5] If you are fortunate enough to find several like-minded      couples, join together in the enterprise.    </p>    <p>      [6] If you don't succeed the first time, try again!    </p>    <p>      Do you use any power tools (rototiller, etc.) in your      farming or gardening? And did you prepare your soil      extensively?    </p>    <p>      The only "power tool" we have ever used is a pickup truck.      Our garden was plowed once the first year we came to      :Maine, some 25 years ago, and never since. The area where      we put our blueberry bushes was never plowed. Instead the      land was heavily mulched, well fertilized, and subsequently      kept as weedless as possible.    </p>    <p>      We've heard quite a bit about your affiliation with the      Social Science Institute in Harborside. Just what is the      purpose and scope of the Institute?    </p>    <p>      The Social Science Institute is a nonprofit educational      organization chartered under the laws of Maine. The      Institute is authorized to carry on various kinds of      educational work . . . including research and the      publishing, printing, and distribution of educational      literature. Through the Institute we also arrange lectures,      hold classes, and engage in original writing.    </p>    <p>      Do you use electricity for any purpose (such as      refrigeration, heating, etc.) and, if so, from what      source(s)?    </p>    <p>      We didn't have electricity at all in Vermont. It is      available in Harborside and we use it chiefly for lighting      and to run a freezer and a bathroom heater. Otherwise we      heat and cook with wood.    </p>    <p>      Since you use seaweed as a mulch for your strawberries,      could you comment on any drawbacks or advantages in using      such mulch on other plants? I've tried hay as a mulch but      it's usually cut so late that the seeds it contains make      next year's garden look more like a pasture than a      vegetable patch!    </p>    <p>      Seaweed has one great advantage over hay! It contains no      weed seeds. It has a second advantage in that it breaks      down physically so long as it remains moist. A third      favorable characteristic of seaweed is the rather large      quantities of nutrients (including trace minerals) which it      contains. (It also contains salt, of course . . . but      whether or not that is an advantage depends on what plants      are being mulched. In our experience, asparagus-whose      ancestors were seaside plants-is one of the few      garden crops to derive some benefit from the salt.)      Finally, when added to compost, seaweed acts as a      protein-rich activator.    </p>    <p>      In what way do you move very large rocks during your stone      construction projects?    </p>    <p>      We use iron bars, chains, planks, and stoneboats. The      heaviest boulders-which usually go into the      foundations-are moved on a stoneboat that we pull      behind our pickup truck.    </p>    <p>      In handling heavy stones always keep them supported off the      ground by sliding the rocks on metal or wood. Never allow a      boulder to nose into the earth.    </p>    <p>      During the actual construction of a wall, we use only those      rocks that any two people working on the project can      handle.    </p>    <p>      When building with stone, how does one go about carrying      the stonework up into the peak of a building?    </p>    <p>      Erect a scaffold and pull pails of rock and concrete up      with a stout rope and pulley. Lately we've been building      with stone only to the second floor plates of a building,      which largely does away with the problem. It is best to      keep the stone portions of a structure low . . . a story      and a half at most. The ideal would be to not lift any      concrete or rocks more than five feet.    </p>    <p>      I'm building a stone house and need to know: After a footer      is poured and set, are you able to make provisions for      floor joists without later disrupting the slip-forming of      the walls where they make a junction with the floor? In      other words, is the floor joist laid directly on the sill      above the footer . . . or is it beveled and made a part of      the wall?    </p>    <p>      We've done it both ways, depending on the thickness of the      wall. If the wall is broad enough we bevel the joist and      set it in. The joists are set into an indention of the wall      made by a form which is then withdrawn as the wall is      erected.    </p>    <p>      My question concerns window and door frames in stone      building construction. I don't understand how the window      and door frames fit into the forms. From reading your book      it seemed that your forms were designed to be versatile in      that different size forms weren't required to fit between      the window and door openings. But the section covering the      door and window frames explains how they stick out into the      rooms a specified amount . . . thus creating a finished      trim and window frame all in one operation. What's      confusing to me is just how the forms can fit over the      recessed frames and how the forms on the outside come in      the seven inches to meet the recessed frames. And what      keeps the concrete from running out of the forms around the      timbers framing these openings?    </p>    <p>      We vary the position of our door and window frames in      different buildings. Some frames are flush with the      outside, some with the inside, and some are centered. When      your wall has reached the sill level the forms are placed      in positions on top of the wall making the necessary joist      with the wall.    </p>    <p>      Set your forms up to the frame and extend them out from      there. Thus, they will fit any type frame.    </p>    <p>      Don't make your concrete too moist! Keep it dry, firm, and      sticky . . . about the consistency of a brickmason's      mortar, and you'll have little trouble making it stay where      you want it.    </p>
