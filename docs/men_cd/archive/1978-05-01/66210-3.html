        LEFT TO RIGHT: There's nothing like a urethane-coated nylon rain jacket (Sierra West sells this one for $31) to keep you dry when the fog gets lumpy . . . Anyone for a freeze-dried pear chip (top photo)? A bagful?equivalent to four pears?weighs only 1.6 ounces ($1.80 from Mountain House) . . . Out West offers these wool gloves (bottom photo) for $6.95 . . . Wigwam wool socks ($3.95 per pair) are terrific foot warmers. BELOW: Snow-blindness needn't be a problem if you take along a good pair of sunglasses (such as these French-made Makalos). CLOCKWISE FROM VEST: Ascente makes this down filled vest ($40) . . . The aver-popular Peak I stove ($28) by Coleman . . . This tiny Optimus 8-R stove ($31) will run over an hour between white gas refills . . . One of the nifty new candle lanterns on the market (Diamond Brand's $2.10 ""Taiwan"" model).
