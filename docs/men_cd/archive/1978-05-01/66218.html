            				     <p>		 From Robert C. Winans of Lutz, Florida and George Fournier      of Charlton City, Massachusetts    </p>		<hr />        <p>      Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Winans of Lutz, Florida keeps several      dozen rabbits (along with laying hens, fishing worms, and a      year-round garden) on the acre of land to which he and his      wife have retired.    </p>    <p>      And when it comes time to eat one of his homegrown hares,      Uncle Bob doesn't rely on any cookbook . . . nor does he      fall back on some time-honored but ordinary cooking method.      What he does is invent new ways to prepare the tasty meat      as he goes along!    </p>    <p>      George Fournier of Charlton City, Massachusetts-on      the other hand-prefers to adhere to one favorite      rabbit-cooking formula that has never let his family down.      "It's a recipe my Canadian wife, Monique, brought to      Massachusetts with her as part of her dowry . . . part of      the accumulated farm kitchen wisdom that's passed down from      generation to generation in a land where tradition is still      a part of one's inheritance."    </p>    <p>      According to her husband, Monique Fournier's Canadian      rabbit stew "will stick to your ribs through a whole day's      chores, and keep you till the dinner bell rings".    </p>    <p>      The first three recipes on these pages, then, will give you      some idea of Bob Winans' creative flair ("I've developed      these myself," he writes, "and I believe your readers will      enjoy them as much as we do"), and the fourth will present      you with the chance to experience a wonderful Canadian      tradition!    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's staff has tested all four recipes, and the results      (pictured here) are some of the best-tasting rabbit dishes      we've ever sampled. Try 'em for yourself and see!    </p>   <h3> RABBIT FRIED WITH GRAPEFRUIT JUICE</h3>    <p>      1 cup all-purpose flour<br />      1 teaspoon Season-All (we were unable to find this in      MOTHER's area, so we did without)<br />      1 teaspoon garlic powder<br />      1/4 teaspoon pepper<br />      1/4 teaspoon thyme (optional)<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      1 three-to four-pound rabbit, cut into pieces<br />      the juice of one grapefruit<br />      1/2 cup cooking oil (or enough to measure 1/4 inch in      bottom of pan)<br />      1 medium onion, chopped    </p>    <p>      Combine the flour with the seasonings. Dip each piece of      rabbit in the grapefruit juice, then roll it in the flour      mixture until the meat is thoroughly coated. Pour the oil      and chopped onion into a deep, heavy pot and heat over a      high flame. Place the floured rabbit in the pot and brown      each chunk on first one side and then the other. Lower the      flame, stir together the remaining grapefruit juice and      flour mixture, and add them to the pot. Cover and let      everything simmer together until the meat is tender,      turning the rabbit pieces from time to time to keep them      from sticking.    </p>  <h3> RABBIT SAUSAGE</h3>    <p>      the coarsely ground meat and fat of one large rabbit (save      the bones for soup stock)<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons salt<br />      1 teaspoon pepper a pinch of ginger<br />      2 or more teaspoons sage (to taste)<br />      1 teaspoon thyme<br />      a pinch of garlic powder<br />      a dash of cayenne pepper, or two or three dashes of hot      pepper sauce (optional)<br />    </p>    <p>      Combine the seasonings with the ground meat (everything      together should total about two pounds), and regrind the      mixture (this helps to get everything well blended).      Refrigerate overnight. The next day, test the flavor by      frying a small patty, and adjusting the seasoning if that      seems necessary. Form one-pound rolls of the meat, wrap      them in freezer wrap, and place the ready-to-slice rolls in      your freezer (the frozen sausage can be cut quite easily      when you're ready to use it).    </p>    <h3>RABBIT SOUP</h3>    <p>      the bones of one or more rabbits<br />      1-2 quarts water<br />      sliced carrots<br />      chopped onions<br />      pre-soaked lentils or split peas fresh or canned      tomatoes<br />      salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste<br />      a few pieces of suet or a little butter    </p>    <p>      (Note: The exact amounts of the above ingredients are      purposely not specified, to allow you to vary them      according to your preference or what you have on hand.)      Boil the bones and water in a good-sized stock pot. Then      remove the bones from the stock and scrape all the meat      from them. Return the chunks of rabbit to the broth and add      the carrots, onions, lentils or split peas, and tomatoes .      . . plus any other vegetables you may wish to Include in      your soup. Season, add suet or butter, and simmer until the      vegetables are tender.    </p>   <h3>CANADIAN RABBIT STEW</h3>    <p>      1 large, whole rabbit<br />      1 quart water<br />      2 tablespoons cornstarch<br />      6 sliced carrots<br />      6 medium potatoes, diced<br />      1 cup whole kernel corn<br />      1 cup green peas<br />      1 cup wax or green beans<br />      1 medium onion, chopped<br />      1 cup diced celery<br />      1 bay leaf<br />      salt and pepper to taste<br />      <br />      Boil the rabbit in the water until its meat is tender, then      remove it from the pot and bone it. Put the meat into a      large kettle, add two cups of the broth in which the rabbit      was cooked, bring to a boil, and add a thickening sauce      that you've made by stirring the cornstarch into 1/4 cup of      the remaining rabbit broth. Allow the kettle's contents to      boil for another minute, then reduce the heat. Add all the      remaining ingredients.    </p>    <p>      "Now for the piece de resistance, the topping that makes      this stew stand head and shoulders above the rest!" says      George Fournier.    </p>    <p>      1 cup flour<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      2 tablespoons chilled shortening<br />      1/4 to 1/2 cup milk (the less you use, the better the      dumplings seem to hold together)<br />      <br />      Sift the dry ingredients together into a bowl, then cut in      the shortening with a pastry blender until the mixture      resembles coarse meal. Add the milk all at once, stir      lightly just until the dough holds together, and then drop      rounded tablespoonfuls of the mixture on top of the gently      bubbling stew. With the heat adjusted so that the liquid      just simmers, let the dumplings      cook-uncovered-for ten minutes, then cover and      let them cook ten minutes longer, or until the steam has      fluffed them up nicely.    </p>    <p>      If you need to thicken the stew, do so after removing the      dumplings. And George recommends serving homemade tomato      relish and cranberry sauce on the side, to give your hearty      meal just the proper finishing touch.    </p>
