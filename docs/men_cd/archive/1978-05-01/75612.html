He      gets forty calves a year from his herd of grade dairy cows.    </p>    <p>      For the first four days the calves are allowed to run with      their dams. Then they are put on whole milk to which a      little skimmilk has been added. The amount. of skimmilk is      gradually increased until at the end of two weeks no more      whole milk is fed. Kibby gets them started on shelled corn      by throwing a handful of it in the pail of milk. When they      have finished the milk, they start in very readily with the      corn. Alfalfa hay is kept before them all the time. In      spring and summer, when old enough, they get the run of the      pasture.    </p>    <p>      Kibby raises only the heifer calves. During the summer he      can get from three to four dollars for bull calves, but he      gives them away in winter because there is no market for      them at that time. "It does not pay to fatten them for      veal," says Kibby "During the six weeks or two months that      it takes to fatten them, they should have at least ten      quarts of whole milk a day and fifteen quarts would be      better. When milk brings me ten cent's a quart, you can see      at once that it wouldn't pay me. They could be fed      skimmilk, but they will not fatten on that."-W. C.      M., Iowa.    </p>    <h3>HOGGING DOWN CORN</h3>        <p>      With a good stand of soybeans in the cornfield, is tankage      required for most economical gains on hogs Last year the      Iowa experiment station ran fourteen shotes weighing around      143 pounds each for thirty-five days on corn in which there      was a good stand of Manchu soybeans. A similar group was      fed the same way except for the addition of tankage      self-fed.    </p>    <p>      When corn grain in the field was figured at 61  cents a      bushel, soybeans in the corn at 75  cents per acre, and      tankage at $65 a ton, it was found that the more economical      gains were made by the tankage-fed pigs and the gains per      bushel of corn were likewise greater.    </p>    <p>      Soybeans in the cornfield were not enough to balance the      ration of ear corn properly and economically; the addition      of tankage increased the daily gains some forty percent and      reduced the cost of 100 pounds of gain from $5.84 to $5.38.    </p>    <p>      Skimmilk, buttermilk or other good supplements would serve      the same purpose as the tankage. Both groups had access to      a mineral mixture consisting of salt 20 pounds, ground      limestone 40 pounds, spent bone black 40 pounds and      potassium iodide one-half ounce to 100 pounds of mixture.    </p>		<h3>A NEW USE FOR OLD    SHIRTS</h3>        <p>      Children's drawers may be made for small children for      everyday wear from the tails of discarded blue work-shirts.      Cut off the tails as in diagram 1, having previously ripped      off the pocket with a safety razor. Then shape them      according to diagram 2, using a pair of drawers of the      right size to measure by. Hem sides, lap over and overcast.      Put bands on top and buttonholes. Sew together with a      French seam. Hem bottoms. If desired, a band the color of      the little ones' dresses may be used on the bottom,      especially if the drawers are made from blue percale or      apron gingham. I always put bands on the tops of children's      panties for every-day wear instead of using elastic as my      physician has told me that the continued wearing of the      tight elastic may cause harm in later years.-Mrs. L.      A. D.    </p>   <h3>WHEN FUR IS PRIME</h3>    <p>      When does skink fur become prime? Or when can we begin      trapping? Also, what is the best way of removing the odor      the clothes?-N. D., Wis.    </p>    <p>      The fur of the skunk usually is in good condition early in      November, but that will depend a great deal on weather      conditions. The skunk is one of the first fur bearers to      become prime. The odor can be removed from the hands and      clothing by the use of gasoline.    </p>   <h3>DRAIN THE GRAPE LAND</h3>        <p>      A couple of years ago a friend of mine who lead a      considerable acreage of grapes found that there was an      unusually large amount of winter-killing.    </p>    <p>      The only explanation we could hit upon was that there was      too much water in the soil at the season when grapes should      be hardening off.    </p>    <p>      You cannot get away from some winter injury in seasons of      unusual severity, but year in and year out injury can be      lessened by first draining land that needs it if grapes      have by chance been put on ground a shade off in this      respect. Next stop cultivation in July or August and seed      buckwheat, oats, barley, or wheat, which will tend to try      out the soil and at the same time not shade the ground too      much.    </p>   <h3>WINTER GARDEN WORK</h3>        <p>      If the work that may be done in winter is taken care of the      work in the spring when we are rushed will trouble us much      less. Trash and old stalks of tomatoes and potatoes should      be gathered and b caned or made into a compost heap. Manure      should be spread, and the earlier the better if it is at      all fresh, the rotted manure is better spread nearer time      when the plowing is to be done in the spring. Then when      soil is dry enough and frost is out of the ground any time      after New Year the ground may be plowed and it will settle      enough to be just right for planting. Seeds will germinate      much more certainly and grow off better in a fairly firm      soil, and plowed soil will dry out after spring rams and      may be worked without loss of this vital time when seeds      must be planted for early garden. If all this work is out      of the way, the garden tools bright and well sharpened,      trellis material all ready to put in place, stakes for      things needing them, and poles for the beans and peas all      handy, things will move smoothly and we will avoid the      discomfort of having the work behind and crowding us, while      weeds shout for joy, and crusts form to dissipate the      moisture.-L. C.    </p>   <h3>A THREE-LEGGED SAWHORSE</h3>    <p>      There is a particular advantage in owning a sawhorse like      the one shown when it is to be used out of doors. The      ground is seldom level, and the horse with four legs tips      back and forth when one attempts to use it, unless one leg      is blocked.    </p>    <p>      The horse is made in the usual way, with the exception of      one end. Here a single leg made from a 4x4 supplants the      two. It is braced with a short piece as shown.    </p>    <p>      Fir is ideal for making this sawhorse because it is tough,      firm and relatively light.    </p>    <p>      The third leg in no way prevents its use on floors and      other level surfaces.-D. R. V.    </p>    <h3>      Squibs from a Farm Wife's Note Book    </h3>    <p>      When cooking very, sour fruits, a very little salt added      will make less sugar necessary.    </p>    <p>      To prevent splashing when frying meat, sprinkle a little      salt in the pan before putting the fat in.    </p>    <p>      Flat silver may be nicely cleaned in the water in which      potatoes have been boiled.    </p>
