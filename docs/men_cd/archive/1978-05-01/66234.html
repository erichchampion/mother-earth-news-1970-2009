                  				    <p>       From Home <em>Energy How-To</em> , a Popular Science book      by A.J. Hand, copyright 1977 by the author and reprinted      with the permission of Harper 8 Row Publishers, Inc.      Available in hard cover ($9.95) from any good      bookstore.<br /></p>			<hr />    <p>"In a recent four-year period," says A.J. Hand, a former    how-to editor at Popular Science magazine, "the number of    U.S. homes with central air conditioning tripled. For much of    the country-though-there are cheaper, more    energy-efficient ways to keep cool."</p>    <p>      And in the "Home Cooling" chapter (reprinted here in its      entirety) of A.J.'s book, Home Energy How-to, you'll find      detailed explanations of some of those ways to beat the      heat, cut costs, and reduce energy use-all at the      same time!-this coming summer.    </p>    <p>      Americans use more electricity just to run their air      conditioners than is produced in all of China. And, while      not so many years ago we all got along fine      <em>without</em> air conditioning, today most Americans      consider it a necessity rather than the luxury it is.      Luxury or necessity-however you classify air      conditioning-the fact remains that it consumes a lot      of electricity. And it's an area of energy use that's in      great need of conservation measures.    </p>    <p>      The air conditioner manufacturers realize this, and they're      doing everything they can to make more efficient products.      You can do your part too. First of all, don't buy or use an      air conditioner unless you really need one. There are      cheaper, less energy-consumptive ways of keeping cool,      which we'll discuss later In this article. By all means try      them before you turn to air conditioning. Even if they      don't solve your cooling problems entirely, they'll still      take some of the load off any air conditioner you decide to      use later . . . saving energy and money all the while.    </p>		<h3>RATING ENERGY EFFICIENCY</h3>    <p>      If you decide you really need an air conditioner, think      small, because refrigerating an entire house Is wasteful.      Small window units can cool one or two rooms to which you      can retreat when the rest of the house gets uncomfortable.      And while you're thinking small, think "efficient".    </p>    <p>      The efficiency of an air conditioner is expressed by a      number called the Electrical Efficiency Rating (EER). The      EER is simply the cooling capacity of the unit in Btu's,      divided by the unit's wattage. All air conditioners sold      today must have the EER labeled on the machine. But if you      buy a used unit with no EER label, remember that you can      compute the rating yourself simply by dividing Btu's by      watts.    </p>    <p>      What's a good EER? Well, it varies with unit size. Tiny      portables might be considered good at an EER around seven,      but a large room unit would have to rate over 10 before it      could be considered highly efficient. Central units peak at      around 10 or 11.    </p>    <p>      If you want to figure how much it will cost you per year to      run an air conditioner, multiply the unit's wattage rating      by the hours the unit runs (1,000 is about average), then      multiply again by your cost for electricity in dollars per      kilowatt hour. Divide this number by 1,000 and you have      your yearly operating costs.    </p>    <p>      Extra efficiency almost always costs you extra money: A      higher EER means a higher initial purchase price. If you      want to find out how many years it takes a high-efficiency      unit to pay back its extra cost over a cheaper, low-EER      machine, just compute yearly operating costs for both      machines as described in the preceding paragraph. Then      divide the yearly savings of the more efficient unit into      the difference in purchase price between the high and      low-cost machines.    </p>    <p>      Chances are you'll find the high-efficiency unit pays off      in three to eight years in the South, where air      conditioners are run more frequently. But it may take 20      years for such a machine to pay for itself up north. Since      the life span of a typical air conditioner is only 10 to 15      years, the high EER wouldn't pay off. But if you live where      it takes this long to make up the difference, you really      don't need an air conditioner anyway since you'll only be      using the machine about eight days a year.    </p>    <p>      Of course all these calculations are based on the      ridiculous assumption that your electrical rates will      remain stable. No doubt, however, they will rise . . . and      as they rise the economics of the efficient unit get better      and better.    </p>    <p>      Buying the right size air conditioner is important,      and-fortunately-it's better to err on the small      side than it is to get one that's too large. This is      because much of an air conditioner's ability to keep you      cool comes from its dehumidifying abilities. A large unit      cycles on and off so often that it never gets a chance to      dry the air. A smaller unit, on the other hand, will run      longer each time it turns on and will do a much better job      of dehumidifying. While your dealer can help you select the      right sized unit for your needs, you can do an accurate job      yourself by consulting a copy of the "Cooling Load Estimate      Form", available from the Association of Home Appliance      Manufacturers, 20 N. Wacker Drive, Chicago, III. 60606.    </p>		<h3>TUNING YOUR AIR CONDITIONER</h3>        <p>      If you have to use an air conditioner, you should always      keep it in tune. This is a simple job consisting of a few      easy steps, many of which need be performed only once a      year. Other steps-such as cleaning      filters-should be performed at least monthly.    </p>    <p>      If you have central air conditioning, shut off all the      power to the unit. Then check to make sure the fan belt on      the blower is properly tensioned. Press down on the belt      halfway between the pulleys and measure the deflection. It      should run around 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch. If the belt is      loose, tighten it. But if it's too tight it can create      excessive loads on the bearings, so don't overdo things.    </p>    <p>      Air conditioning requires a greater flow of air than      heating does. If your blower has an adjustable pulley, make      sure it's set to run at the highest speed. To make the      adjustment, loosen the set screw on the pulley and twist      the outer flange so that it is as close as possible to the      inner flange. This narrows the pulley and forces the belt      to ride higher. Check belt tension after making the      adjustment.    </p>    <p>      Clogged filters are probably the biggest wasters of energy      your cooling system has to tolerate. Filters should be      cleaned or replaced once a month, but most homeowners don't      do the job at all. While you're in the cleaning mood, clean      the condenser and evaporator coils. Use a commercial coil      cleaner, available at a refrigeration supply house. And      when you're there, pick up a fin comb . . . a simple      plastic tool used to straighten bent fins.    </p>    <p>      To use the cleaner, spray it onto the coils and fins and      let it set for about 10 minutes. Then rinse with a hose or      a spray of clean water from a squeeze bottle. If the coils      are still dirty, give them a follow-up treatment. To use      the fin comb, match the teeth-per-inch rating on the comb      to the fins per inch on your air conditioner's coil. (The      comb will have different sections with varying teeth      spacing.) Then run the comb through any bent fins.    </p>    <p>      Last, check to make sure that airflow over your air      conditioner's outdoor condenser coil is not blocked by      bushes or other vegetation. Shading the condenser will      raise efficiency about two percent, as long as the airflow      is not blocked. Small evergreens planted a safe distance      away from the condenser will provide the shade. Just be      sure to prune them back if they begin to choke oil air to      the coil.    </p>    <p>      Room air conditioners should get the same treatment as      central units. Clean the filters and coils, and oil the      motor if it has oil fittings. Straighten bent fins, and      check outdoors to be sure the airflow through the unit is      not being impeded.    </p>		<h3>ADJUSTING AIRFLOW</h3>        <p>      If you have a window unit, and if it has adjustable louvers      to direct its airflow, set them to force the cool air      upwards. Cool air naturally drops to the floor. Aiming it      upwards will help distribute the air before It has a chance      to stagnate at your feet (Unimpeded airflow is just as      important inside the house as It is outside. Be sure no      furniture or curtains block the air conditioner's output of      cool air.)    </p>    <p>      Central conditioning units can be adjusted to distribute      cool air just where you need it. With central heating, one      can adjust dampers in the ducts to provide warm air to      those rooms that should have it the most, and you can do      the same thing with central air conditioning.    </p>    <p>      Rooms requiring one setting in winter will require a      different setting in summer. So you'll have to change the      damper adjustment every time you switch a central      heating/cooling unit from heating to cooling. That's why      it's a good idea to mark the position of the damper handle      once you've found its ideal setting for winter heating.      Then mark it again at its best setting for summer cooling.    </p>        <p>      Remember, too, that it's best to close down the dampers in      ducts leading to rooms that need little cooling. This will      provide more cool air to the rooms that need It most. The      general rule is that rooms where there is a lot of activity      or heat (the kitchen, for example) will need the most      cooling.    </p>    <p>      Most air registers are located near the floor. This is fine      for heating, but not so good for cooling. The cool air      tends to come out at floor level and just stay there until      It's picked up by the return air duct and routed through      the cooling system once again. You keep recycling the same      cool air over and over this way, and it never gets high      enough in the room to have any cooling effect on most of      your body. You can remedy this situation to some degree by      installing clip-on or magnetic baffles over the central air      conditioning system's registers, to direct the airflow      upwards. (Of course you'll want to take these off during      the heating season or you'll wind up with all the hot air      hugging the ceiling during the winter.)    </p>    <p>      An even more effective way to spread cool air throughout      all levels of a room is to use a high-return air duct      system. With this method, a return air duct is placed up      high-near the ceiling-where it draws off the      hottest air in the room and sends it to the air conditioner      for cooling.    </p>    <p>      To install a high return duct, remove the finished wall      surface between the two studs that straddle a return duct      mounted low in a wall. Then install a sheet metal liner or      rectangular duct leading from the low duct up to a position      near the ceiling. Install a new register grill at the high      return and cover the wall again.    </p>    <p>      Now you can switch between the high return for cooling and      the low return for heating by closing off one or the other      with a metal plate. Or you can install grills with built-in      dampers to achieve the same effect.    </p>		<h3>THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES TO AIR    CONDITIONERS</h3>    <p>      There are many other techniques that will increase the      summer cooling efficiency of a house. Adequate      weatherstripping and Insulation, duct insulation, caulking,      and such window adaptation ideas as double glazing,      application of light control film, and installation of      storm windows will all provide warm-weather benefits as      well as certain wintertime advantages.    </p>   <h3>VENTILATION</h3>        <p>      And there are some other ideas for cooling that may well      eliminate the need for air conditioning altogether.      Probably the most important is proper attic ventilation.    </p>    <p>      During the summer, temperatures as high as 130 degrees are      not at all uncommon in an attic. This heat, in effect,      turns your ceiling into a radiant heater. With proper      ventilation-either natural or fan-induced-you      can drop attic temperatures way down. Most effective are      fans installed near the peak of a roof, and controlled by      thermostat. The 'stat will turn the fan on at a temperature      usually around 110 degrees, then cut it off when the heat      drops to about 95.    </p>    <p>      Roof-mounted vents are more effective than gable-mounted      fans because you can position them near the midpoint of a      roof's length. Most are sized to fit right between the      rafters, so installation is quite simple. Just cut a hole      through the roof and place the unit in position, slipping      the attached flashing up under the shingles. Then, inside      the attic, wire the fan to a junction box. For best      results, the fan should be teamed up with soffit vents.      Installing gable fans is usually even simpler since there's      no need to cut through the roof.    </p>    <p>      Natural attic ventilation can be increased by installing      ridge vents or turbine ventilators. Ridge vents provide a      continuous-though weatherproof-opening for the      full length of a roof's peak. The total free or open area      of the roof vent should then be matched by an equal area of      soffit venting to provide a free flow of cooling air. The      total area of roof and soffit vents should be equal to at      least 1/300 of the attic floor area, and twice that much      vent area is even better. In addition to carrying off hot      air, vents also exhaust humidity, which provides another      cooling bonus.    </p>    <p>      Before air conditioning came along, ventilation was the      only way to cool a home. You can set up ventilating air      currents with a fan or rely on natural powers of      convection. The trick is to bring in cool air near or below      ground level and exhaust it from the attic.    </p>    <p>      Convection or stack cooling relies on the hot air within      your home rising and creating a chimney or stack effect.      For best results, open your basement windows to let in      cool, close-to-the-ground air.    </p>    <p>      Once the cooler air is in the house, it should have an      unrestricted path through which to travel. Open the door at      the head of the basement steps, make sure all interior      doors are open, and open the door to the attic. If your      attic has no door-just a hatch or a folding stairway      that will inconveniently block up a hallway-put a      screened hatch in your upstairs ceiling. Last, provide some      way for hot air in the attic to escape. Roof vents, gable      vents, ridge vents, or a turbine ventilator will all help      get the air moving.    </p>    <p>      If you decide to use fans or powered vents, it still pays      to set your home up as described. The stack effect will      relieve the fan of some of its work and help encourage      better airflow. Remember, ventilation can help cool your      home by getting rid of trapped heat, but it will not make      your home any cooler than the temperature outside. On the      other hand, the slight breeze created by ventilation will      make your home feel cooler than the thermometer might      indicate.    </p>   <h3>ROOF COLOR</h3>        <p>      Everyone knows that a white roof is cooler than a dark one.      It reflects a substantial part of the sun's energy. But did      you know you can change the color of roofing without      reshingling? Roofing paints are the secret. They can go on      over shingles, roll roofing, even metal, and can add years      to the life of the roof . . . by virtue of both protective      coating and reflective cooling. Most large paint stores      carry roofing paints, as do Sears and Montgomery Ward.    </p>    <h3>RADIATOR COOLERS</h3>    <p>      If you happen to have a well, spring, or other source of      cool water on your property, you can cool your home very      effectively without running an air conditioner. One fellow      refrigerates his six-room Oklahoma house by pumping well      water through three automobile radiators housed in a wooden      box outside one of his windows. A squirrel-cage fan forces      air through the radiators and into the window. Even in      100-degree weather this system keeps his home's temperature      down to 70 degrees. Water at 59 degrees is pumped through      the radiators at a rate of about 500 gallons per hour, and      circulated water is returned to the ground via a second      well.    </p>   <h3> ROOF SPRINKLERS</h3>    <p>      Water can cool your home another way: If you fasten a      simple sprinkler-type hose-upside down-to the      peak of your house's roof, you can use it to trickle water      down the roof and set up an evaporative cooling cycle.      Connect the sprinkler to an outdoor bib and adjust the flow      to use as little water as possible . . . just enough to      keep the roof wet down to the eaves is best.    </p>
