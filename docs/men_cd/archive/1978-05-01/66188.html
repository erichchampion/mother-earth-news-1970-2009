           				      <p>      You've finally arrived! Your life's dream has come true.      You have your own back yard . . . or woodlot . . . or,      maybe, even a "little place out in the country" where you      can live just a bit closer to nature and a bit further from      the Plastic Society.    </p>    <p>      Hey! Look at all the wildlife on your property: the birds      singing in the trees, the squirrels jumping from branch to      branch, the rabbits that live in the fence row, the moles      and shrews which tunnel under the sod. Even the      wildflowers, shrubs, grasses, and clovers growing on the      plot (no matter how small that piece of land may be) take      on a new significance when the property is <em>yours.</em>    </p>    <p>      Wouldn't it be great if you had some way to "work with" the      natural flora and fauna on your land . . . to protect and      improve it . . . use it to increase other people's      awareness of the fragile environment in which we all live .      . . to, in effect, <em>create your own wildlife      sanctuary.</em>    </p>    <p>      Well there is a way to do exactly that! Thanks to an idea      sponsored by a 45-year-old international non-profit      environmental organization headquartered in Wheeling, West      Virginia . . . almost anyone, anywhere, can register almost      any piece of property, of almost any size, as a personal      wildlife sanctuary. The program-which is only a      little over four years old-is already being used to      protect more than 16,000 acres in ten states. (The smallest      sanctuary is a 30 X 100-foot lot in New York City, and the      largest encompasses 2,200 acres in Virginia.) How can you      get in on this Good Thing too? And what will the program do      for you and your piece of land?    </p>    <p>      Easy! All you have to do to become part of this program is      sign a pledge stating that you will manage your      land-no matter how big or how small the property      might be-in a manner that protects and improves its      natural flora and fauna. That's it. And I hasten to add      that the signing of this statement in no way compromises      your ownership or personal rights to your land. All-I      repeat- <em>all</em> it does is put you on record as      being a concerned property owner who is dedicated to the      preservation of your land's native flora and fauna.    </p>    <p>      This simple act registers your property with the sponsoring      organization and entitles you to assistance with any      environmental problems or questions you may have. (Typical      queries that the sponsoring organization has answered: How      can I improve my land's habitat for squirrels and rabbits?      What trees should we plant to provide food and shelter for      birds?)    </p>    <p>      In addition, for $1.00 each (the only expense you'll incur      in the whole program), you'll be furnished with as many      attractive metal signs (stating that your property is a      registered wildlife sanctuary) as you want.    </p>    <p>      What you <em>won't</em> receive is a dun for registration      fees, hidden costs of any kind, reports to fill out, legal      commitments of any nature, or an obligation to <em>do</em>      anything. This is an entirely voluntary, do-it-yourself      environmental program. You're completely free to oversee      and manage your personal sanctuary in the way you think      best. And if, for any reason, you ever decide you want out      of the whole shebang . . . no problem. Simply take down      your signs. It's that easy.    </p>    <p>      I've had my small acreage registered for a little over      three years now, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.      During that time I've improved the habitat for small      mammals on the place by establishing a couple of big brush      piles and planting native food plants. I've also improved      the property for me (and me for it!) by cultivating native      wildflowers and becoming far more aware of the wildlife      around me.<br />    </p>    <p>      And don't underestimate the importance of those "wildlife      sanctuary" signs I've posted along my land's borders. As      simple, straightforward, and obvious as they may seem to be      . . . they work! On the one hand, they've materially      reduced the trespassing that "no hunting" and "no      trespassing" signs seemed unable to stop. And on the other,      they've attracted interested (and interesting!) people      who've looked me up to learn more about "what's going on"      (I've become something of a local wildlife "expert" to      these last folks, thanks to the bird identification      information which I've received from the organization that      sponsors sanctuaries like mine.)    </p>    <p>      In short, I think this whole grand idea is a lot of fun and      very worthwhile. It has given me a good, warm, solid      feeling to know that I'm actually doing something      constructive to preserve the natural environment . . .      instead of just sitting around, wringing my hands, and      hoping that things will get better. I also enjoy knowing      that my little piece of land is part of something much      bigger (over 16,000 acres now!) which is devoted to      reversing the degradation of our beautiful planet.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to help this worthy program expand and      flourish by signing up <em>your</em> property as a wildlife      sanctuary, write to the Brooks Bird Club, 707 Warwood Ave.,      Wheeling, W.Va. 26003. The folks there will send you a      packet of information which explains the program in more      detail. And do write today! And then do join! And then do      spread the word to others! I think we're onto something      here.    </p>
