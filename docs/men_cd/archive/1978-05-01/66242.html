                      <p>      We all know (or should know) that the internal combustion      engines in our automobiles, tractors, lawn mowers, etc.,      are <em>called</em> "internal combustion" engines because      they combust (burn) their fuels internally (inside the      powerplants).    </p>    <p>      And a few of us even know that the old-timey steam engine      is an <em>external</em> <em>combustion engine</em> . . .      because its fuel is burned outside the cylinders in which      its drive pistons operate.    </p>    <p>      What a good many of us don't know, however, is      that-over the years-[1] a number of other kinds      of both internal and external combustion engines have been      invented, [2] one of these external combustion powerplants      operates on something known as the "Stirling cycle", and      [3] inventor John Ericsson built and successfully ran a      Stirling engine on nothing but sunshine away back in 1872.      (See. And you thought all this solar energy business was      something new!)    </p>    <p>      At any rate, MOTHER's researchers recently bought a very      small Stirling-cycle engine for $31 from Solar Engines,      2937 West Indian School Rd., Phoenix, Ariz. 85017. And,      after running it with heat from an external alcohol flame      for a while, someone said, "Hey! I betcha we could operate      this little dude on solar energy."    </p>    <p>      Well, we just happened to have a onesquare-foot Fresnel      concentrating lens (purchased from Edmund Scientific Co.,      3877 Edscorp Building, Barrington, N.J. 08007) handy. So      the guys in the shop quickly rigged up a little frame of      scrap lumber to hold the lens and the tiny powerplant so      that when the former was aimed at the sun it'd focus a hot      spot directly on the latter's drive cylinder.    </p>    <p>      By that time it was three in the afternoon and Ole Sol was      fading fast for what was really too small a concentrating      lens, so MOTHER's experimenters cheated a little and      brought the engine's cylinder up to working temperature      with a propane torch. Then they shielded the setup from the      wind, backed off, and let the sun take over. And take over      it did . . . which is why the engine you see here was      running at 1,000 rpm-strictly on concentrated solar      radiation-when the photograph was taken.    </p>    <p>      And now you know why several research labs around the world      are tinkering with very large concentrating and tracking      solar collectors designed to heat a working      fluid-such as cottonseed oil-to several hundred      degrees, store the superheated liquid in an insulated      container . . . and then tap that source of heat both day      and night to run a Stirling-cycle engine big enough to do      some really useful work. MOTHER will report on this subject      as progress is made.    </p>
