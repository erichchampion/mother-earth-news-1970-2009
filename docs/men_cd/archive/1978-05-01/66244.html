               	 <hr />	 <p>      <strong>Whether your well has just gone dry and you need a      new (and preferably low-cost) source of water . . . or that      sprig you've been drawing from doesn't always produce as      much as you (or your animals) would like . . . or you've      grown tired of the taste of city water . . . you'll want to      see what Penny and Lou Kujawinski (authors of the following      article) have to say about collecting and storing      <em>rainwater</em> for homestead use.</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Have you ever looked at a pretty piece of land but      hesitated to buy the property because it lacked water?      (Quite often, an otherwise-attractive parcel of land that      has no well, pond, stream, or spring will be priced so low      that you may be tempted to buy the tract anyway.) Lack of      ground water is a common problem . . . one that the folks      in our part of Missouri-early settlers and      present-day farmers alike-have learned to get around      by the use of something known as a <em>rainwater      cistern</em> .    </p>    <p>      A rainwater cistern is-as the name      implies-simply a setup for collecting rainwater      (usually the precipitation that falls on your home's or      barn's roof) and storing it until it's needed in a (usually      underground) concrete or masonry tank. Cisterns are ideal      for farms and homesteads situated on waterless land, or for      areas where the natural ground water is too      hard-contains too many dissolved minerals-to      drink, use for washing hair, etc. (Fact is, some of the      people hereabouts who <em>have</em> good springs on their      property have gone ahead and installed cisterns anyway,      just because they prefer the taste of rainwater.)    </p>    <p>      We didn't feel out of place, then-upon moving to our      present home-when we designed and constructed a      simple rainwater-collection system large enough to supply      all our needs for water. And-despite the limitations      inherent in such a system-we've never regretted      having gone this route. (It sure beats spending upwards of      $1,000 to drill a well for water that <em>may</em> or may      not be there!) Quite possibly, a cistern could be the      answer to your water-supply problems, too.    </p>    <h3>HOW TO KNOW WHETHER A CISTERN IS "RIGHT" FOR      YOU</h3>    <p>      Cisterns won't work for everybody. In fact, for such a      setup to be at all useful, the following conditions must      apply:    </p>    <p>      [1] You must live in an area that gets plenty of rain. As a      general rule, you can figure that if crops can be grown      without irrigation where you live, there'll probably be      enough precipitation to meet your water needs. (In times of      drought, you can do what we do: Have water hauled in, at a      cost of about $10 per 1,000 gallons.)    </p>    <p>      [2] The rainwater collection surface-usually a house      or barn roof-should not be located near (or downwind      of) any source of pollution (such as a major highway,      fields or orchards where spraying occurs, or factory      smokestacks).    </p>    <p>      [3] Your water needs must not be excessive. (For those of      us who prefer a dry toilet to the kind that wastes up to      seven gallons of H 2 0 with every flush, this requirement      shouldn't pose much of a problem.) Of course, if you're      thinking of building a cistern to <em>supplement</em> your      present well, spring, etc., this factor becomes less      important. The main thing to remember is that if-like      the average American family-you use 100 gallons of      water per person per day . . . you're either going to have      to cut down on that consumption, or build a cistern large      enough to fulfill your needs (which-depending on the      amount and frequency of rainfall in your area-could      mean a tank of 5,000 to 10,000 gallons' capacity, or      larger).    </p>   <h3>UNDERGROUND OR ABOVEGROUND?</h3>    <p>      Cisterns can be built above- or below-ground. The advantage      of an aboveground installation is that the weight of the      water itself (as long as the storage tank is above      faucet-level) can be harnessed to pressurize your home's      waterlines . . . whereas with an underground cistern, it's      necessary to pump the water from the storage vessel to the      house. On the other hand, with an underground cistern [1]      the water remains cooler in the summer (resulting in less      evaporative loss), and [2] there's no danger of the liquid      freezing in winter. We chose to build our cistern      underground for these reasons.    </p>   <h3>HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?</h3>    <p>      Cisterns can vary widely in cost, depending on how fancy      you want to get and how much of the installation you do      yourself. Our system-which centers around a 13'-deep,      1,100-gallon storage tank built of fieldstone and      mortar-set us back a total of about $100 . . . for      everything, including gutters, cement, pipes, and an      old-style manual pitcher pump. By contrast, some neighbors      of ours spent approximately $1,000 to have a contractor      install a pre-cast concrete cistern with an electric pump      and an automatic chlorinator. As you can see, then, exactly      how much you spend on a cistern installation depends      largely on what you have more of: time or money.    </p>    <h3>THE CISTERN'S COMPONENTS</h3>    <p>      All cistern setups can be divided into three components:      [1] the water collection system (roof, gutter, and      downspout), [2] the filter, and [3] the water storage      vessel (or cistern).    </p>    <p>      A very important thing to keep in mind about your cistern's      water collector is that the collection surface (the house      or barn roof, in most cases) must be free of any      material(s) which might pollute the water it catches. (A      painted surface isn't suitable, since chips of the      protective coating will inevitably wash down into the      storage tank.)    </p>    <p>      To aid in keeping their collected water clean, most cistern      owners install a "shut-off" (or short length of movable      pipe) in their systems' downspouts. Then, during the first      few minutes of a rain-when all the soot, bird      droppings, etc., that have accumulated on the roof's      surface begin to wash away-the runoff can be diverted      away from the cistern. (This tainted water can be shunted      to the garden or used in any way you'd use "gray water".)      Shortly afterwards-when it has rained a few minutes      and the water flowing through the downspout appears clear      and clean-the shut-off can be switched back to direct      the remaining portion of the shower or storm into the      cistern.    </p>    <p>      The filter mentioned above is usually nothing more than a      concrete enclosure (see diagram) that's divided into two      sections by a partition reaching two-thirds of the way to      the chamber's top. One of the two sections is left empty,      while the other is layered full of filtering material(s) .      . . usually gravel, fine sand, and/or activated charcoal.      The idea is that as water flows from the downspout to the      first (i.e., empty) section of the "filter box", bits of      leaves, dirt, etc., will settle out . . . then-as the      collected liquid spills over the partition and begins to      percolate down through the layers of filtering      material-smaller impurities also will be removed. A      screen prevents any remaining debris from flowing into the      supply line that connects the filter box with the cistern.    </p>    <p>      The cistern itself should be made of concrete, stone, or      some other non-corroding, non-contaminating material (wood      and metal are <em>not</em> recommended). In addition, the      storage tank must be [1] watertight, [2] effectively sealed      against outside contamination, and [3] fitted with some      type of overflow opening. For optimal protection against      contamination, the cistern's hatch door should fit tightly,      the overflow should be screened to prevent small animals      from entering, and care should be taken to locate      outhouses, septic tanks, cattle run-off areas, etc., at      least 100 feet away (preferably <em>downhill</em> ) from      the tank. (Note: Your cistern most definitely <em>should      have</em> a hatch door on its top, since the vessel's floor      <em>will</em> need to be cleaned every couple of years or      so.)    </p>    <p>      Although we don't necessarily recommend the use of such      poisons, chlorine and other chemical disinfectants can be      added to your cistern-either manually or by means of      an automatic dispenser-from time to time to ensure      the sterility of your water supply. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:      Some commercially available water disinfection units rely      on heat or ultraviolet light-rather than      chemicals-to get the job done. Look in the Yellow      Pages of your phone book under "Water Purification      Equipment" or "Water Supply Systems".]</em> You may want to      consult the local health authorities-or your county      agricultural extension office-about whether or not      you should disinfect your cistern's water.    </p>   <h3>THE PUMP</h3>    <p>      Unless your cistern is situated above faucet-level, you'll      need a pump to force the water out of it. Here-as      with wells-you can choose from any number of kinds of      devices (some expensive, some not) to do the job. For      simplicity and low cost, we installed a hand-operated      piston pump atop our cistern . . . and it works quite well.      If you decide to go this route, remember that a piston pump      can only draw water a maximum of 25 feet from the source.      (Which means you should build your cistern close to the      house if you intend to use an indoor hand pump to empty      it.)    </p>   <h3>THE KUJAWINSKI SYSTEM</h3>    <p>      Our own system-though it works well enough for our      needs-bears the marks of a first-time      do-it-yourselfer and could stand some upgrading in certain      areas. For instance, our water collection surface (a 24' X      24' cabin roof) should really be somewhat bigger to furnish      us with a truly adequate water supply. (As it is, it takes      a 5" rainfall to bring our cistern up to the 600-gallon      mark.) Then too, the underground tank could've been a      little larger . . . but digging through the hardpan clay we      have in this area is no easy chore.    </p>    <p>      I might add that although fieldstone is inexpensive and      abundant, it was not the best possible choice of      construction material for our holding tank, since [1] the      stones in our area are of odd sizes and shapes (rarely      square or flat) and [2] the process of fitting each rock in      place individually was excruciatingly slow and fatiguing. A      small additional outlay for the extra cement and gravel      that would've been necessary to do the whole job in      concrete would have made life a lot easier . . . and      construction a great deal speedier. (The cistern's      reinforced-concrete top was certainly easy enough to      fabricate.) Now that the job is finished, though, I suppose      our only real regret is that the beauty of the cistern's      stone walls cannot be seen from above.    </p>    <p>      One part of our system that we're particularly pleased with      (especially considering that its dimensions were arrived at      mostly by guesswork) is the water filter (a trapezoidal      concrete box divided into a 2' X 3' X 1'-deep "main      section" and a smaller, triangular section with 18"-long      sides). So far, we haven't had a chance to try sand,      charcoal, and gravel in combination . . . instead, we've      had to rely just upon pea gravel and metal screening as      filtering agents. (The screening is installed below the      gravel as well as atop the filter box's partition wall.)      Nonetheless, we're quite happy with the clean water that      our filter produces.    </p>  <h3>DO SOME DIGGING BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h3>    <p>      If I had just one piece of advice to give to someone who's      interested in installing a rainwater cistern, it'd be this:      Do your homework <em>before</em> you begin. Check with your      state health department and the state department of      agriculture for literature on the subject of cisterns and      water systems. Also, talk to your county agent . . . he may      be able to suggest (or even give you) helpful bulletins,      reprints, etc. A trip to the library could also prove      beneficial.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, you won't find detailed discussions of      cisterns in many of the popular books on homesteading. Two      guides that do cover cisterns in some depth are: [1] the      American Association for Vocational Instructional      Materials' <em>Planning for an Individual Water System</em>      (available for $7.55 postpaid from AAVIM, 120 Engineering      Center, Athens, Ga. 30602), and [2] Volunteers in Technical      Assistance's <em>Using Water Resources</em> (available for      $5.00 plus 95 cents shipping and handling from Mother's      Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739).    </p>    <p>      Do a little digging and you just may find that a lack of      ground water doesn't have to keep you from purchasing that      much-wanted patch of land in the country. Not if you're      willing-like us-to drink (and bathe in) a      little rainwater now and then.    </p>
