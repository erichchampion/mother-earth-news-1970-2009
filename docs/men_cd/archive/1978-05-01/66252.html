                <h5 id="byline">by GORDON SOLBERG</h5>	<hr />    <p>      <strong>Make protein-rich bread from homegrown amaranth,      the "weed" that can yield a cup of grain from a single      plant.</strong><br />      <br />    </p>		     <p>      One of the most interesting "new" summer cereals that any      farmer or gardener has experimented with recently comes      from a gigantic Technicolor "weed" called grain amaranth.      Although it has been cultivated for centuries by the      <em>Indios</em> of Mexico, amaranth remained largely      unknown in this country until a few years ago. Yet this      fascinating plant (a member of the same family as the      tumbleweed and the lovelies-bleeding) produces as high a      yield -acre for acre-as a well-favored      wheatfield, bears grain with a protein content of 18%      (double corn's 9% ), can thrive and produce a crop on soil      too dry for corn to even grow on, is so hardy it requires      little care, and is seldom bothered by insects.    </p>    <p>      Our homestead is in southern New Mexico, and I've always      considered corn to be my standard summer grain. When      <em>Organic Gardening and Farming</em> began to take a      strong interest in <em>Amaranthus</em>      <em>hypochondriacus</em> a couple of years ago, however, my      curiosity was aroused. I've been experimenting with      amaranth ever since . . . sometimes with surprising      results.    </p>    <p>      At first I was skeptical about the whole idea: "I'm      perfectly satisfied with corn," I thought, "so why do I      need amaranth?" But by the time my first crop of the new      grain had reached maturity, 1 was already beginning to      appreciate a couple of its most important advantages: [1]      Amaranth will bear seeds no matter how dry the season (the      drier the weather, the smaller the yield, of course) . . .      whereas corn must have a certain minimum amount of water      before it will produce ears. [2] While corn attracts borers      and ear worms like a magnet, amaranth just doesn't seem to      interest insects at all. (For these two reasons alone,      amaranth may turn into a valuable supplemental grain crop      in many parts of the country.)    </p>    <p>      If my experiences are an indication, you shouldn't have any      trouble growing a test patch of this amazing new plant. Be      warned, however, that mature amaranth stands six to nine      feet tall . . . so sow it on the north end of your garden      where it won't shade out smaller crops. And, since the      nine-foot giants can be blown down by a strong wind, try to      locate them next to a fence that will support their stems.    </p>    <p>      Sow amaranth seeds in the spring-about corn-planting      time-in the kind of soil that weeds like best: rich, moist,      and sunny. The seeds are tiny-approximately the size      of pinheads-so don't bury them too deep . . 1/8" is      about right. Then, since they'll be in the topmost layer of      soil-which is quickly dried out by the sun-keep      your amaranth plot moist (sprinkle it, or cover it with      burlap, or do both) until the seeds have sprouted. (The      almost-invisible shoots will peek out in about a week and,      at first, you'll only be able to <em>see</em> them if you      get down on your hands and knees. Later on, however, the      amaranths will develop into miniature "trees" that      <em>tower</em> overhead.)    </p>    <p>      As soon as the young' uns start crowding each other, thin      them out to one plant every one or two feet. ( <em>Organic      Gardening</em> says the thinnings are edible, but our      family finds them too bitter. Our goats, on the other hand,      love 'em.) Keep the weeds down (the OTHER weeds) until the      amaranths are about 12" tall. After that, the competition      won't stand a chance.    </p>    <p>      If your plants get plenty of water, they should grow a very      noticeable inch a day until midsummer. Then they'll put      forth large, feathery yellow and purple flower heads . . .      and the neighbors will start to ask, "What in tarnation are      <em>those</em> things?" (Full-grown amaranths are      spectacular enough to serve as excellent backdrops for      flower gardens.)    </p>    <p>      As the weeks go by, the heads of the amaranth plants will      start to sag with the weight of their nutritious cargo.      They'll be ready to pick in late summer or early fall and      here's how to check them for ripeness: Go out on a dry      afternoon and rub part of a seed head between your fingers.      If some of the pellets fall into your hand, the plants are      ready for harvest.    </p>    <p>      The best time to reap amaranth is early in the morning,      when everything is soaked with dew and the wet seeds won't      scatter. Wear gloves (to avoid the prickles), and chop off      your giants' heads with a machete. If you gather only a      few, cut them up and spread 'em out on newspapers to dry in      the sun for three or four days. If you have a lot of heads,      though, you'll do better to slice and dry them on a long      plastic sheet inside a hot attic or shed (that way you      won't panic whenever a cumulus cloud moves toward the      homestead).    </p>    <p>      When the pieces of seed head are completely dry, you can      thresh them. Because my amaranth operation is still a      relatively small one, I handle the job by simply shoving      all our dried amaranth heads through a wire-mesh screen (to      break them up and knock the seeds loose). If you have a      large crop, you may want to throw all the pieces down on a      clean floor . . and then dance a jig on 'em, or flail them      to bits with a large stick.    </p>    <p>      Winnowing the seeds from the chaff is always a lot of fun.      First I clean all the dirt or manure or whatever out of my      trusty old wheelbarrow. Then I load the barrow with buckets      of broken-up seed heads and trundle 'em off to "just the      right" spot. (Winnowing is best done out in the open in a      steady light breeze . . . any stronger wind will blow the      tiny seeds away.) When I've found exactly the conditions I      want, 1 grab a handful of the pulverized mixture, hold it      about shoulder-high, and slowly release it. The lighter      chaff is blown away, while the heavier seeds fall down into      the wheelbarrow . . . an elegant and totally satisfying      process when everything is working right.    </p>    <p>      (Of course, the wind doesn't <em>always</em> cooperate. In      fact, if you ever need to put up aluminum siding, or work      on a windmill, or do any other job that would be far easier      accomplished in a dead calm, try this: FIRST, start      winnowing. Even a freshening breeze will die away      -guaranteed!-the instant the first handful of      mixture leaves a bucket. THEN you can amble over and put up      the siding. That's on the good days. On the bad ones the      wind won't <em>quite</em> drop to zero . . . but will keep      blowing <em>just enough</em> to sucker you into starting      your seed sorting. Then it'll quickly whip around and blow      a mouthful of chaff into your face!)    </p>    <p>      When the wind and I have finally reached enough of a      Mexican standoff to actually winnow my grain-and      there's nothing left in the wheelbarrow but amaranth      seeds-I pour the harvest into jars, store the      containers away in a cool and dry place, comb the chaff out      of my hair, and get ready for some good eating.    </p>    <p>      We grind the seeds into flour with our grain mill. The      flavor of the cereal is mild enough for you to make whole      amaranth bread, if you want, but we usually mix our      <em>Amaranthus</em> <em>hypochondriacus</em> flour with an      equal amount of wheat flour. The amaranth adds a wholesome      "earthy" tang . . and my wife Judy says that the resulting      bread tastes like high-class wheat-crackers (without the      crunch). However you choose to describe it, I'm sure you'll      agree that this easy-to-grow, nourishing, protein-rich, and      somewhat unusual grain is good!    </p>    <p>      Amaranth is still scarce in this country, and the big seed      companies probably won't be offering it for a few more      years. So, if you want to grow the grain but can't find any      seeds anywhere else, send a dollar and a self-addressed,      stamped envelope to: Gordon Solberg, Box 23, Radium      Springs, N.M. 88054. I'll mail you about 200 of the little      buggers.    </p>    <p>      After that you're on your own . . . 'cause if you can get      even one plant to grow, you'll have enough seeds for a      lifetime. Which is probably about how long you'll be      growing amaranth, too, since this completely awe-inspiring      plant yields such a delicious, nutritious crop . . . that,      once you try it, you'll never want to be without it!    </p>
