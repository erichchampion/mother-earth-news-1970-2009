                       <h5 id="byline">by CLARICE RAINEY</h5>			<hr />    <p>Don't let high food prices get you down. Not when you can    hike over to the nearest stream or pond, pick a mess of    cattail stems ( <em>or</em> flower heads <em>or</em> roots    <em>or</em> shoots), and eat like a king for free!</p>        <p>      At one time or another, you've probably noticed cattails      sprouting up like exclamation points in nearby streams      and/or marshes. You may even have picked some of these      distinctive aquatic "weeds" to use in dried floral      arrangements. Unless you're a "wild foods" aficionado,      however, you may never have eaten (or even heard of)      cattail corn, Cossack asparagus, or reed mace flour . . .      and you may not have known that the common cattail-      <strong>Typha latifolia</strong> -was prized as a      food and fiber plant by both ancient Chinese and Egyptian      civilizations.    </p>    <p>      Few people seem to be aware of it, but the common cattail      is actually a highly nutritious and <strong>astonishingly      versatile</strong> source of food. Its stems can be      prepared as a vegetable . . . the pollen can be used in      bread recipes . . . the plant's distinctive flower spikes      can-be cooked like corn . . . the bulbous shoots at the      base of the stem are delicious when boiled . . . even the      cattail's roots can be processed into a rich (and highly      palatable) flour. (Euell Gibbons was probably right when he      wrote: "For the number of different kinds of food it      produces there is no plant, wild or domesticated, which      tops the common cattail.")<br />    </p>    <p>      What makes <strong>T. latifolia</strong> a particularly      valuable wild food resource, however, is the fact      that-unlike many other "forageables"-the      cattail [1] grows throughout the U.S. and [2] cannot be      mistaken for another plant (or vice versa). Even the novice      forager can easily recognize the cattail's slender stalks      and distinctive, cigar-shaped flower spikes.    </p>    <p>      While its true that reed mace (as <strong>T.      latifolia</strong> is sometimes called) can be harvested      year round, the delicacy known worldwide as Cossack      asparagus is best prepared from two-to three-foot-long      shoots gathered in early spring. Simply grab the young      plant(s) near the water level and pull. You'll find that      you've liberated a section of stem about a foot in length      (and left the plant's roots in the ground). Now, if you'll      peel back a few layers of "skin" from this stem, you'll      soon come to a pale-greenish "core" that can be cooked and      eaten just like asparagus. (The dish is absolutely      delicious . . . and so much less expensive than "real"      asparagus!)    </p>    <p>      With the arrival of early summer comes another taste treat:      cattail corn. To prepare this delicacy, pick the plant's      seed heads when they're still in the sheath. Husk off the      sheaths, boil the bud-studded heads as you would fresh      corn-on-the-cob, then-just before serving-dip      the heads in melted butter. You'll find that the flavor is      very similar to that of the roasting ears to which the reed      mace heads are very closely related.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, the hot days of summer bring yellow pollen to      the cattail's flower spikes . . . pollen that can easily be      shaken off into a jar, combined half and half with ordinary      wheat flour, and used to make delicious muffins, pancakes,      waffles, and other bread items. (Breads made with cattail      pollen-you'll find-are not only economical and      good-tasting, but eye-pleasing, too . . . the powder adds a      warm, yellow color to baked goods.)    </p>    <p>      Even during the cold winter months, <strong>T.      latifolia</strong> offers foragers a bounty of free      nutrition . . . in its roots. You can make a highly      satisfactory "all purpose flour" by peeling, drying, and      grinding the plant's ropelike roots (and sifting out any      residual fibers) . . . or you can cut away the little      nodules (which contain the next season's shoots) from the      upper part of the root structure and boil 'em. (These      nodules make an excellent substitute for rice or potatoes.)    </p>    <p>      And as if all this weren't enough, the cattail has a number      of non-culinary uses, too. Native American tribes, for      instance, once used the stalks of the plant to make      baskets, mats, and (sometimes) shelters. (They picked the      stalks green, hung 'em up to dry, and-in the case of      baskets and mats-soaked strips of the material before      weaving them into useful items.) Also, early pioneers      discovered that kapok-the cotton-like substance that      forms on cattail spikes in late summer-could be used      as a soft "filler" for pillows, stuffed toys, and      mattresses.    </p>    <p>      No matter how you look at it, then, <strong>T.      latifolia</strong> -the common cattail-is one      heck of a versatile "weed"I (There aren't many      plants-wild or cultivated-that you can eat,      weave with, and sleep on!) Perhaps the many outstanding      virtues of this aquatic "super plant" should be better      publicized . . . or should we keep the cattail's secret to      ourselves?    </p>
