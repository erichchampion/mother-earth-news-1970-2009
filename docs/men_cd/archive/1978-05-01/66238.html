                    <h5 id="byline">by GEORGE FOURNIER</h5>        <p>      When that freakish May snowstorm passed through our neck of      the woods last year, one of the first "casualties" on the      farm was our favorite apple tree (the one our two young      sons had called their "sourapple"). The old tree had had a      bad crotch (which the person who'd planted it about 50      years ago had either ignored or failed to notice) about      three feet from the ground . . . and sure enough, one real      he-storm was all it took to send a fissure clean through      the weakened area.    </p>    <p>      Not that the loss of the tree mattered all that much where      our homestead's fruit production was concerned. (I'd been      planning to plant a new orchard of dwarf pear and apple      trees soon <em>anyway</em> .) Nonetheless, it seemed a      shame to have to let a perfectly good half of an apple tree      go to waste. "Surely," I told myself as I cut branches off      the storm's victim to give to my goats, "there must be a      way to salvage this proud old apple-bearer."    </p>    <p>      As I looked at the fallen tree half, I happened to notice      that the force of hitting the ground had buried one branch      fairly deeply, and the leaves on that particular branch      seemed greener and in better shape than the rest. That's      when it hit me: "Maybe there's a way to <em>propagate</em>      a part of this old tree!" I exclaimed.    </p>    <p>      My Uncle Paul-an old farmer from way back-had      the answer I needed (it seemed he'd been saving      storm-damaged orchard stock all his life). He described in      detail how I could save my apple tree, and the minute I got      back from visiting him I began putting his advice to work.    </p>    <p>      The first step is to choose a fairly straight, smooth      branch that-when looked at with two or three years'      growth in mind-has no bad features about it . . .      such as a weak crotch (where two or three branches come out      of the trunk at the same place), a scar where the bark is      missing, or too long a stretch with no smaller branches on      the sides.    </p>    <p>      Once you've selected a suitable branch, the next step is to      make a cut on either side of it at the base, leaving a 6"      or 8" section of limb where your new tree's roots would      normally be (see diagram). This will give you a scion      shaped like an upside-down "T".    </p>    <p>      Now dig a hole about 18" deep where you want the tree to      grow, and throw compost or well-rotted manure into the      excavation until it's only 12" deep. Cover this with      another two inches or so of dirt, and position the scion's      "T"shaped base in the hole. Pack more soil firmly around      the "T". (At this point, some folks like to place a three-      to five-pound rock on the tree's roots-or stub, in      this case-on the side of the tree that's expected to      receive the strongest wind. If you care to do this, first      place an inch or two of soil over the roots or stub to      provide a "cushion" of earth between the tree and the rock.      Then lay the stone down.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, fill the hole with dirt and pour in a little water      every once in a while (just as you'd do whenever you plant      any tree). A whole pailful of the liquid isn't too much, if      you have fairly good soil drainage. If-on the other      hand-you have to contend with a heavy, clay soil, use      about half as much water.    </p>    <p>      Your new tree won't need any more care than any newly      planted tree or shrub. Now and then, check to see that any      small branches which seem to be dying are plucked off . . .      keep the base of the plant free of suckers . . . and water      as needed. That's all there is to it!    </p>    <p>      Thanks to Uncle Paul's tree-propagation method, a tree-half      that might have been consigned to the dump (or at least to      our goats) is now a "brand new", fruit-producing (we hope)      apple tree on our homestead once again. Next time you're      faced with having to throw a storm-damaged tree away, give      Uncle Paul's technique a try. You just may save the tree's      life!    </p>
