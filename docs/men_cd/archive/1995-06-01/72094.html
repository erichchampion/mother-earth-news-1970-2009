                    <p>      <em>Build an indoor-outdoor potting bench to be proud of      using inexpensive shelf lumber, pegboard, and simple      tools.</em>    </p>    <p>      You can't buy a decent potting/planting bench any more. The      garden-goods mail-order catalogs occasionally list      mini-benches stapled of thin mystery wood and dyed to      resemble California redwood. With some reinforcing they      might do for a space-short apartment dweller repotting a      few house plants, but they are too puny for any      half-serious country gardener.    </p>    <p>      You can buy seed-starting batteries ...if you have money to      spare. A pair of four-foot-high, bobby pin-shaped      metal tubes holding tiers of trays under dual-bulb/4-foot-      long, full-spectrum fluorescent lamps go for prices ranging      from $300 to $1,500 or more. Worth it maybe if you grow      prize-winning African violets, but mighty pricey for giving      the tomatoes a few weeks head start each spring.    </p>    <p>      Here's a combination potting bench/ starting battery large      enough to handle all your indoor-gardening chores. It is      made from inexpensive 3/4-inch-thick #2 pine shelving and      1/4-inch-thick peg-holed hard-board panels. You can buy the      major components cut to size at most large home-improvement      centers. It's easy to construct with household tools, tough      enough to hold up, and if you stain the wood, will look      great in the back hall or out in the sun room.    </p>    <p>      The work counter can be as high as your legs dictate, and      it is a robust 4 feet wide by 2 feet deep-though, if      space is limited, you can lower the top and narrow it to      three or even two feet in width. The top has a 3-foot-high      (or two-foot or 1 1/2-foot-high) peg-board back offering      space to hang tools or install shelves or a shallow      cupboard. With the addition of a few plugin light fixtures      and sturdy, easily adjustable shelves, it will hold enough      seed-starting flats to start the tomatoes plus plenty of      broccoli, eggplant, celery, early cabbage, and annual      flower seedlings for most homesteadsized gardens.    </p>        <p>      Dimensions and specifications needn't be followed exactly.      Boards should be cut to lengths given unless you change      height or width. But, since the actual width and thickness      of lumber is about 1/4" or so less than "nominal" (you pay      for wood removed all around to plane it smooth), all      measurements incorporating width or depth are done on the      job.    </p>    <p>      If you have a bench saw you can rip (cut lengthwise) any      inch-or-so-thick lumber, new or scrap-the more dirt-and      waterproof the better if you will be using it outdoors. A      good alternative would be nominal 4/5" (actually      1-inch-thick) cedar or pressure-treated pine decking; rip      the 6-inch-wide boards to the widths specified in the plan.      Especially for the benchtop, you can use thicker soft wood.      hardwood such as oak or hard maple would be better if you      want to use the bench for heavy work and if you have the      stock, tools, and skill to work it.    </p>    <h3>Tools & Technique</h3>    <p>      Construction of the bench is simplicity itself. Rigidity      and squareness are guaranteed by back and side panels of      pegboard that comes with factory-squared edges and parallel      sides. The lumber and peg-board (that I'll call "peg" for      short) are easily fastened with glue, tacks, or staples and      selftightening drywall screws. I used a cordless      drill/driver to pilot-drill fastener holes and to      countersink and set in selftapping screws. Lacking power      tools, you can do it with a little hand drill and      screwdriver.    </p>        <p>      Don't try to put in nails or screws without drilling pilot      holes, and don't overtighten any fasteners or you'll split      the wood, especially where holes are close to the board      ends. And please do not nail the bench together except      where specified. You can split the relatively thin lumber,      and nails in the soft wood will work loose in time so the      bench becomes wobbly. Nails are for hammering up decks and      framing barns.    </p>    <p>      Costs for all-new materials will range between the $111      that I paid to several times that if you purchase fancy      wood. The optional hardware-store lighting fixtures cost me      an added $35. You can spend several hundred dollars for      fancy Gro-Lites in several configurations, but they won't      start your plants any better.    </p>        <p>      Decide the width and height that will make the bench fit      your work level and available space in the house. The bench      top should be at a comfortable standing work height. Most      kitchen sinks, counters and benches for standing work are      36 inches high; most desks and tables that you sit at are      about 30 inches. To adjust the height, increase or decrease      length of the leg boards. To make the bench more narrow      (from side-to-side) than the designed 48 inches, subtract      up to 24 inches from the peg-board that forms the back, and      from the benchtop boards and other side-to-side horizontal      members. To decrease the front-to-back (depth) measurement,      trim the long sides of the peg-board side panels and the      front-to-back trim, and perhaps use narrower lumber for the      rear legs than the specified 9-inch-wide hoards.      (Six-inch-wide rear legs would go nicer with a bench      trimmed by 6 inches to a depth of 18 inches    </p>    <h3>Materials</h3>    <p>      Peg comes in 1/4" and 1/8" thicknesses Choose the 1/4". It      is heavy and half again more expensive, but more rigid than      the thinner grade. If the lumber yard sells pegboard precut      into 4' x 4' and 2' x 4' sire., you piece the parts      together from these easy-to-handle panels. If not, you will      have to cut up a single 4' x 8' sheet. Set peg flat on      sawhorses, or held just off the floor by blocks. Using a      fine-toothed plywood blade on any power saw, cut it slowly.    </p>    <p>      If you bought peg precut into a 4' x 4' and a pair of 2' x      4's, trim each 2' x 4' panel across the 2' dimension to      give one 2' x 2 1/2' and one 2' x 1 1/2' section. With duct      tape of on both sides, fasten the two 1 1/2' lengths to the      cut end of the large sheet to give a single piece that is      4' wide and 5 1/2' long. (You'll put a wood brace across      the long seam later.    </p>    <p>      Using a single 4' x 8 'sheet of peg board, bisect the board      across its narrow (4') dimension 5 1/2' feet from one end      to produce one 4' x 5 1/2' sheet to form the back. Then,      split the leftover 4-foot-wide, 2 1/2-foot-deep panel      across the longer (4') axis to form the pair of 2' x 2 1/2'      panels that make up the sides.    </p>        <p>      Not all lumberyards stock shelving pre-sawn to the sizes      required, but will have standard 8- or 10-footers you can      saw to length. (Look down the long edges of the longer      boards to be sure they are not warped). If they have      4-inch-wide but not 3-inch, 4 is fine. If there is no      8-inch-wide lumber, 6 will do. If they have 3-inch-wide,      but not 2-inch, use the 3s or rip a 4-inch board down the      center.    </p>    <p>      Here are the main parts you want on hand before you start      assembly:    </p>    <p>      -One 4' x 5 1/2', and two 2' x 2 1/2' panels of      1/4"-thick peg-board<br />      -Two rear legs of 8-inch-wide (or 6") lumber, both 6      feet long<br />      -Four leg boards, two of them 4 inches wide, the      other two 3 inches wide and all four an even 36 inches long      (or your preferred bench height less the thickness of the      counter top-designed to be 3/4".)<br />      -One 1"x 6" x 46" front brace<br />      -One top shelf of 1" x 8" x 48" pine.    </p>        <p>      If boards that are open to view have rough, irregular, or      dyed ends, you can trim them by a quarter-inch or so (so      long as the trimming doesn't make them too short). The cut      ends should be a perfect 90 degrees (square) and both rear      legs, all four front leg boards, benchtop and shelf boards      must be the same lengths. No need to trim the lower      shelving boards that aren't open to view-indeed, you can      use rough lumber that you'll be able to price down.    </p>    <p>      For a few dollars more you can have the yard do most of the      cutting for you. Just be sure the yard personnel measure      carefully and cut precisely (which they certainly can)      although they are accustomed to making rough cuts.    </p>    <p>      You will need a saw and square to cut parts that must be      measured to fit on the job. Anything from a big table saw      to a hand-crosscut saw will do. Also needed: a heavy-duty      staple gun and 5/8" staples (or flat-headed tacks), a      hammer and large and medium-sized screwdrivers, a pint of      good woodworkers glue and a small brush to apply it with,      and the fasteners specified in the Materials list.    </p>    <h3>The Eight Steps</h3>    <p>      <em><strong>1. First, lay your boards.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Lay out the peg back-board, and the pine leg-boards and peg      panels that make up the sides-arranged as though the      sides were hinged to the back so they open up and lie fiat      like an old-fashioned folding vanity mirror. You will glue      and staple the sides together and attach the cleats that      hold shelves to back and sides.    </p>    <p>      Place the back-board on a really big work table or a floor      you don't mind getting glue on. Face the shiny, finished      surface up, and arrange it so the smooth, even      factory-finished, 4-foot-long edge is locat ed at the top.      At each side-butted tight against the long sides of the      peg-board-lay the longest boards, the 8-inch-wide,      6-foot-long rear legs. Face the best side of each board      down, as that's the side that will be open to view. Tap the      boards so their top edges are 1/4-inch below the top edge      of the peg-board back (giving you a strip of hardboard to      fasten the topshelf board to).    </p>    <p>      Center a long straight-edge along the bottom of the rear      legs. (An 8-foot-long 2 x 4 is easiest, so long as it is      not warped.) This defines the floor line-where the      bench legs will meet the floor.    </p>    <p>      Arrange the 3-inch-wide front-leg boards (with their bottom      edges along the floor line) two feet to the outside of and      parallel to the rear legs.    </p>    <p>      Put one of the two peg-board side-pan els on top of each      pair of leg boards, rough side up and longer dimension up      and down. Side edges of panels should be even with outer      margins of legs, upper edges even with the upper ends of      the legs, lower edges about 6"from the floor line and Y"      lower than the bottom of the back panel.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>2. Fasten side panels to legs, and install      side-trim boards.</strong></em><br />      Scribe lines on the wood legs around the peg-board so you      can remove the panels and replace them precisely.    </p>    <p>      Remove the peg-board panels, turn downside-up to expose the      shiny side, and brush light coats of woodworkers' glue      where they overlap leg boards. Brush glue on the wood      beneath as well. Place glued surfaces together, lining      adjoining edges and corners precisely, and fasten pegboard      to wood with staples (or with flatheaded tacks)-two rows      down each leg boardfasteners 3/4" or 1" in from each edge,      every three inches.    </p>    <p>      Turn assembled sides over and measure across the peg-board      between inner margins of legs. Cut four 4-inch-wide trim      boards to fit snugly into the (about 13" ) spaces between      inner margins of the leg boards at both top and bottom of      both sides. Measure precisely and use a sharp saw blade to      cut perfectly straight, dean, and square. The cut ends butt      up to factory-straight edges, and wobbly saw cuts will      leave small but telling gaps that betray amateurish work.      Apply glue to peg and to insides of trim boards, align      outer margins of trim boards with edges of peg panels, turn      over and staple. Let dry overnight.    </p>    <div class="side bar">      <strong>Materials</strong>      <p>        Hardboard<br />        One 4' x 8' sheet of 1'4-inch-thick peg-board (or one 4'        x 4' and two 4' x 2' precut panels.)      </p>      <p>        Three rough 2" x 4" x 8' studs to raise peg-board above        floor or table for cutting      </p>      <p>        Number Two Pine Shelving      </p>      <p>        Two 1" x 8" x 6' for rear legs<br />        Four to six 1" x 6" x 4' for front brace and top shelves      </p>      <p>        Five 1" x 4" x 10's for legs, trim and lower shelving        (four can be rough or cosmetic rejects)-for lower        shelves      </p>      <p>        Two 1" x 3" x 6's for legs and braces 50 ft, of 1" x 2"s        in any length for cleats      </p>      <p>        Number One Hard Pine (or other durable stock for        benchtop)      </p>      <p>        Four 4/5" x 4' x 10's or #6 4/5" x 6 x 10s.      </p>      <p>        Fasteners<br />        1 qt, woodworkers' glue and small brush<br />        Ten 2" drywall screws<br />        100, 1 1/2" drywall screws<br />        40, 3/4" #4 wood screws (fastening peg to wood)<br />        20, 1 1/4" #6 wood screws (1" wood to 1"wood + 1/4"        peg- countersunk 1/4 ")      </p>      <p>        1 lb. 1 1/2" galvanized #6 finish nails (rustproof to        fasten benchtop that is subject to wetting)      </p>1 lb. 1" common finish nails<br />      1 lb. 1/2" brads    </div>    <p>      <strong>3. Cut and attach benchtop supports and shelf      cleats.</strong><br />      Fasten "cleats"narrow but stout boardson the sides and the      back to hold the bench-top and shelves.    </p>    <p>      Decide how many lower shelves, upper shelves and shelf      dividers and supports you want. Traditional would be one      shelf in addition to the permanent bottom under the bench      top and two shelves and a divider on top, but choices are      many. I use the shelves to hold light fixtures and      seedstarting trays that I move up and down as seedlings      grow. You may prefer a single bottom shelf and a shelfless      back; with an assortment of pegboard fixtures you can hang      tools, install small shelves and attach other good things      on the back and both sides.    </p>    <p>      Lay back and sides out flat in original positions-mugged      together, feet along floor line, the back 3/4" above sides.      Scribe lines or lay tape running from side to side along      the back panel and both sides-one line along the underside      of the benchtop, and a series of parallel lines along back      and side panels and up the rear leg boards to define the      bottoms of shelves/tops of cleats. (One cleat should go      along the seam in your back panel if you pieced it together      from precut panels.)    </p>    <p>      First, make the doubled cleats that support the rear of the      benchtop. From 1" x 2", cut one 46-inch-long cleat, one 19"      and two 12"s. Double the cleat boards by locating the 19"      cleat in the middle and the two 12"s at the ends of the      46"-inch board, leaving two 3" spaces to hold cross-braces      in the inner edges of the "sandwich:' Fasten with glue and      two nails per section. Center this support against the back      panel, its upper edge at benchtop level. There will be an      equal (1" or so) space at each end. Place top of cleat even      with the bench-board-bottom guideline scribed on the      back-board. Cut two more "sandwiches"of 1" x 2" x 8" and      place at same level to inner faces of rear leg boards, back      ends tight to the peg back.    </p>    <p>      From 1' x 2' pine, cut rear shelf cleats-one for each      shelf location-to be 3'8" (or the bench-top width      less four inches). Cut upper-shelf side cleats that attach      to the inside of the 8 back legs to be 6 1/2" long (or the      side-board depth less an inch). Lower-shelf side cleats      running across the peg sides should be 20" long. Fasten      cleats along scribe marks. Center back cleats on the back      panel. Place side cleats with inner (back of bench) edges      even with rear of pegboard side panels so their front ends      are inset an inch from the front edge of the rear leg      board.    </p>    <p>      Glue all cleats; to assure a good gluebond, weight cleats.      I use bricks. Books will do if you glue-proof them. When      glue is set in an hour or two, but not fully hardened      (set-up time depends on the kind of glue), turn panels over      and set 3/8" wood screws through holes pre-drilled through      back of peg-board panels and into cleats (It is easy to see      through holes in pegboard to drill accurately.). Use 1 1/4"      screws to fasten cleats where they face pegboard, and      3/4-inch-thick leg boards. Set two screws an inch from ends      of each short cleat, and place screws six inches apart on      the long cleats. Let glue dry.    </p>        <p>      4. Build front-leg/brace assembly<br />      Lay out the 4-inch-wide, 36-inch-long front leg boards 4      feet apart on the floor line, with their long dimensions      parallel. Place the 1" x 4" x 46" front brace board atop      the legs with its upper long edge even with tops of the      legs. Adjust legs in or out under the brace board so that      long edges of the legs extend an inch beyond the ends of      the brace (leaving an inch of leg board exposed at each end      of the brace-so front leg will precisely cover the      combined thickness of the nominal 1" side leg and pegboard      side panel). Legs must be square to brace. Apply glue to      the joints and put three 1 1/4" drywall screws in a      triangle shape into the brace/leg junctions. The screws are      going in from the inside, so will not be visible-but      do not set screw heads any deeper than the brace board      surface lest they punch through the outer face of the leg      boards and show.    </p>        <p>      Cut a 28" benchtop-support cleat of 1" x 2", and center it      3 1/2" down from top edge of the 6-inch-wide front brace      (or as far down as the width of the wood you'll be using      [in Step 8] to make front-to-back supports for the      benchtop). Glue and screw in place.    </p>    <p>      Turn the leg/brace assembly and-as when you cut trim      for the sides-measure the distance between inner      edges of front leg boards and cut a length of 1" x 4" stock      to fit snugly between. Put this front-trim board aside for      now.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. Fasten front to sides.</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      Prop the front and side assemblies up on their legs. Mate      front leg boards on the side panels in "L"-shapes with the      front-leg boards just attached by the a Front brace. Have a      helper hold them, or clamp or prop the three assemblies to      stand perpendicular to the worktable. Apply glue along      edges where front leg boards mate. Set sides square to      front and clamp or tape leg boards together as needed to      keep them from toppling over and spreading glue all over      everything.    </p>    <p>      Drill/countersink 1-inch-deep pilot holes through side leg      boards and into front leg boards and insert 1 1/2,"      self-tapping drywall screws to hold these two parts of the      front legs together-screws one inch from each end and      every six inches along the long edge of the front leg      board. Let dry overnight.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>6. Attach top-shelf board to peg      backboard</strong></em><br />    </p>        <p>      While it is still on the floor in correct relationship to      the artificial floor line, tack (attach temporarily with      easily removed nails or screws) one foot-or-so-long pieces      of scrap wood to the bottom of the pegboard back, one at      each side, so they extend (about 6 3/4") to the floor      line-their bottom edges even with bottoms of front      leg boards. This is so you can set the back up for      assembly.    </p>    <p>      Drill 1/16" pilot holes down through the top at each end of      the top-shelf board, holes 3/8" in from and spaced every      two inches.    </p>    <p>      Drill holes every six inches down both 5' 6" long edges of      the 4'-wide pegboard back panel-holes 3/8" in from      the edge.    </p>    <p>      Apply glue to one long edge of the topshelf board and to      the top inch of the shiny, inner face of the 4-foot top      edge of the peg back board. Lay peg flat on the floor,      shiny (glued) side down-but, prop the (gluey) edge 8"      off the floor. Align the glued surfaces of peg and top      board-corners even, top edge of peg even with upper      long edge of the top board. Be sure alignment is perfect,      and tack or tape in place to start if need be. Then,      starting at the center, pilotdrill through back of peg into      edge of top board and nail every six inches. Let that dry.    </p>    <h3>Light it Up!</h3>    <p>      Time was, the best light source available for starting      seedlings were multibulb 48-inch-long commercial      fluorescent fixtures that cost a bundle, weighed a ton and      came with no cord or plug; they had to be hard-wired in      place. You can get lightweight two-bulb models now for      about $20, and four-bulb models for $30, but you still have      to install the cord and plug. If you plan to fill the      entire lower shelf (or two of them) with seedlings, the      investment in large fixtures would be worthwhile; hard-wire      in 48" fluorescent fixtures fitted with new fullspectrum      fluorescent Gro-Lites-sold in the mail-order garden      supply catalogs in packs of six for about $120. Hang yours      from small pulleys so you can raise and lower them easily.    </p>    <p>      I have found over a lot of years' gardening that a      combination of ordinary fluorescent and incandescent lights      approximates sunlight just as well. For the dozen or so      tomato plants I start these days, I use lightsticks and a      single 70-watt GE Gro & Show incandescent floodlight.      Both come with light plastic frames and a wire to plug into      any socket. The fluores cents come in 18", 15-watt and 24"      20-watt models, both with single bulbs, and cost from $10      to $15 apiece. They are lightweight and mount on a couple      of screws, so I keep mine mounted under counters in the      kitchen, shop, or office most of the year-then      transfer them to the planting bench for a few weeks in      early spring.    </p>    <p>      Finally, the hanging-storage capacity of the      peg-holed sides and back give your bench an added      dimension. But, buy the chromed-steel fittings that      hook into the peg-board with their hard-wire backsides bent      into little "L's." The plastic ones are cheaper, but they      attach with spring pegs that frazzle the peg-board hole,      and break easily.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7. Assemble the frame</strong><br />      Turn the sides/front-brace assembly on its feet. It will be      wobbly. To steady it, set one 46 1/2-inch-long lower shelf      board on lower cleats at rear of cabinet; tack it in place      if necessary. Tack a length of 1 x 2 stock across the front      of the back legs where they intersect the bench-top so      outer edges of rear leg boards are a precise 48" apart.    </p>        <p>      Apply glue to bottom outer edges of the top-shelf board, to      back edges of the 6'-tall rear legs and in 3/4" strips down      the inside, long edges of the backboard. Lift the assembled      shelf-top/back panel atop the rear legs. Square it up and      fasten with 1 1/2" nails (don't drive any in all the way      till all are started and structure is square (which may      take some finagling). Once fastened, place assembled unit      on its back to dry overnight, propping and tacking on      cross-braces as needed to eliminate any can't-so all      corners are square, all vertical surfaces are plumb.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8. Set in lower shelf.</strong><br />      Frame, cut, and fasten bench-top Set the bench frame      upright. Decide how deep you want your permanent bottom      shelf to be (five 3 3/4"-wide boards along the back of the      24-inch-deep cabinet, leaving about 6 inches of kick-room      in front, is best for me.) Apply glue to ends and bottom of      end-edges of shelf boards, set them square on bottom      cleats, and fasten with pilot-drilled 1 1/2" nails into      their ends through peg and rear legs. Once glue is dry,      fasten the back of the rear shelf to the peg with drywall      screws every 6 inches.    </p>        <p>      Measuring on the work, cut, and fasten two (about      23-inch-long) dual-board 1" x 4" sandwiches to serve as      front-to-back supports for benchtop boards. Place their      front ends atop the cleat fastened inside the front brace,      and the rear ends into the pair of slots you built into the      rear benchtop support cleats. Cut two short lengths of 1 x      2 to place under the rear ends. Glue and pilot-drill/screw      all to back panel and front brace. Find the 1" x 4" trim      board you made earlier to cover the front brace between      inner edges of front leg boards. Glue and screw-fasten      invisibly through the back of the underlying brace.    </p>    <p>      Measure on the benchtop and cut bench-top boards to fit      from 5/4-inch-thick top-grade, 4-inch-or- 6-inch-wide      lumber. You can have boards butted tight together or      separated by a fraction of an inch. They can overhang the      frame by 3/4" at front and sides (the rear boards will have      to be trimmed to fit between the back legs). Or, for a more      finished look, eliminate the lip; cut all bench-top board      ends flush with front and side edges, and box the sides      with 1" x 2" or 1" x 3" edging-cutting corners at a      45-degree angle if you have a miter saw. If you need to      split a board to fill the top without excess lip at front,      place the narrower board at the back. Glue, pilot-drill and      nail benchtop boards to rim and center supports with 1 1/2"      finish nails. For best-finished appearance, lightly scribe      nailing guide-lines over underlying support-boards and      insert nails evenly in straight lines along scribe lines    </p>    <p>      For a finishing touch, you can rim the shelftop with 1" x      2" boards. Or, use cornice or other molding. I just nailed      a length of 1 x 2 across the front as a lip. Then, I added      another strip at the back to keep stuff from lodging down      between the back and the wall. Now, start growing.    </p>
