                    <h2 id="subtitle">      The Secrets Of Low Tech Plumbing    </h2>    <p>      <strong>How to get all the fresh water you need... almost      anywhere. </strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By John Vivian</h5>    <p>      <strong><em>Take control of your water supply and wet-waste      disposal systems with low-cost, low impact, low energy      rain<br />      catchments and cisterns, water rams, and solar pumps ...      and a dose of plain old-fashoned water      conservation.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Illustrations By Laurie Grace</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      Most of us move to the country in search of a simpler life      that's closer to nature, less wasteful, and more      self-reliant. We happily trade smog for clean coun try air,      city conveniences for rural independence, TV dinners and      jogging for home-baked bread and the honest sweat of      gardening. An adventurous few go "off the grid" to supply      their own electricity with solar panels, a wind generator,      or minihydro. But only true modern pioneers choose to      relinquish that central feature of modern living: unlimited      running water and a flush-and-forget waste disposal system.    </p>    <h3>      Which is a shame.    </h3>    <p>      Much of the continent goes unpopulated because the soil      won't "perk" sufficiently to absorb effluent from a      1,000-gallon septic system that's Building Code-approved to      handle a modern household-or the land is too rocky or      too remote for a well driller's rig. As a result, too many      good folks are forced to abandon their country-living dream      because money is so hard to put by in the consumerist rat      race of urban life-including the $10,000 to $20,000 or more      needed to install a citystyle water system in the country.    </p>    <p>      The greatest shame of all is that modern households don't      really use the 30 to 100 gallons/person/day of water they      consume. They pollute it-not out of necessity, but      for mere convenience. Water is less the essence of life      than a medium for wetwaste disposal.    </p>        <p>      An individual only needs a half gallon to a gallon of water      a day to drink, cook, and wash up with. Laundry and bathing      demands more, but not 40 gallons per drawn bath or      automatic washer load. That monument to Victorian denial,      the flush toilet, takes five to eight gallons per use to      dispose of an ounce or two of waste per person per day, dry      weight. Of the five gallons a minute little kids waste      brushing their teeth (they always leave the tap on full,      right?), only a brush-wetting and one mouth-rinse-a      four-ounce paper cupful-is needed. Automatic clothes      washers use 30 to 50 gallons a load to do what our      greatgrandmothers accomplished in a gallon or two of water      with a washtub, a bar of lye soap, a washboard, and elbow      grease, or with a little more water and a wringer/washer.      Showers waste 12 gallons (eight to 10 with a water-miser      shower head); by contrast, when I was a Marine we were      rationed a count of five to wet down and soap up, and a      count of 10 to rinse off-using perhaps a gallon of water in      all. In the field, we brushed our teeth from a canteen and      bathed, shaved, and washed our socks in a helmet half-full      of water.    </p>    <p>      I don't suggest that we live on a wartime basis (my buddies      and I didn't much like it at the time) or that we go back      to the washboard. But mini-flush toilets, lowflow shower      heads, sewage-treatment plants, and our other feeble      attempts at water conservation not-withstanding, plumbing      systems are predicated on an unlimited supply of pure water      and an environment with an unlimited capacity to absorb      sewage. I'll not belabor the world's growing water      shortages and waste-disposal problems but to suggest that      divert ing a small river through every home to remove a      smitter of waste indentures our water supply to an      exaggerated fastidiousness. There is no reason but      convenience to combine water-supply and waste-disposal      systems. They should be separated in concept and practice,      and water use reduced to a trickle with lowflow/low-tech      plumbing. Water is to sustain life ...and to sail your boat      over and to grow lovely tomatoes and to listen to as it      flows over the rocks-not to insult.    </p>    <h3>      Not For All    </h3>    <p>      Hand-made low-flow, low-tech water systems aren't for      everyone-not yet. They require rigorous conservation,      replacing porcelain bathroom fixtures with privies and      washtubs, and automated kitchen appliances with hand pumps      and dishpans. These devices require time, attention, and      labor-an inconvenience that some solid burghers I know      disdain as pointlessly out of date, contemptuous of      civility and good taste, and proof of a general societal      decline into savagery and depravity. Savage it may be, but      I prefer my spring water to what comes from the faucets in      most cities, and would rather work up a sweat mucking out a      spring or digging a cistern than riding around in a golf      cart or straining at an Ab-Isolator.    </p>    <p>      Lo-tech water systems are probably best for a solitary bear      like myself, for a young couple experimenting with life      before mortgage payments and diapers take over, or for      independent souls or vigorous retirees who don't have to      appear freshly showered and well-creased, crisply shaved,      or coiffed at some in-town office every morning. I can't      see slogging to the outhouse through a yard of new snow      wearing a Brooks Brothers suit. With time, the tough-minded      ideas and gentle technologies we low-flow advocates are      working to perfect will have their splintery seats and      rustic lines smoothed, and will be interpreted in molded      plastic to satisfy the pampered bottoms of urban      sophisticates.    </p>    <h3>      Lo-Flow Water = Low Low Land Price    </h3>    <p>      A willingness to go lo-tech/lo-flow can manifest itself      immediately in money saved on land. The well drillers have      chased me off my mountain, and I've just located a place in      downcast Maine where I can build a cabin and moor a boat      without winning the lottery to pay for it. The price of      seacoast is out-of-sight if it comes with a well-plumbed      house or features "drilled well and septic." It is just      slightly less if "perked, septic approved, electricity at      road:" But if the land is solid granite, if saltwater has      invaded the freshwater aquifer, or soil is too thin to      absorb septic leachate, it's unsuitable for a conventional      dwelling. The initial asking price may not reflect the      impracticality or prohibitive cost of water service, but      you can dicker it down. Then you can discount the cost of      building an all-season road and electric lines. You get the      idea. Taxes on unplumbed land are low too; replace the      outhouse with a flusher and up they go. Look hard and      bargain harder and a predilection for a lo-tech water      system can get you dry (but otherwise prime) landcheap. And      there's enough water most anywhere if you know how to get      it.    </p>    <h3>      Locating Water    </h3>    <p>      All of North America (but genuine desert) receives 10 or      more inches of rain-fall per year. If 80 percent is      captured, each 10 inches of rain falling on a square foot      of land produces five gallons of water a year      Theoretically, in even the semi-arid Western mountains and      plains, the runfrom the roof of a 18' x 24' cabin would      produce 2,000 gallons/year. That's gallons per day; enough      for one toilet flush-or enough to supply a small      family living a water-conserving life all they re filly      need plus water to spare for quick Towers and wash day. But      that's if they reaped every rain shower and if it rained      evenly throughout every year. It doesn't. The whole year's      supply can come in a few impressive gulley-washers, and      drought can persist for years.    </p>    <p>      Not even America's original low-tech water-system users      could beat the natural water cycles. So please don't pack      up the van and head off to New Mexico to homestead beside a      blue line on a topo-map. The so-indicated river may not      flow but twice a year-and then in flash floods. Of      course, there may be a permanent river underneath the bed,      but the water is liable to be undrinkable or so deep you      couldn't reach it. 'Today, most folks intending to stay      long in the arid parts of the country rely less on faith      than on 150-foot deep-drilled well with solar pumps or      windmills.    </p>    <p>      Rainfall accumulates and flows in-evitably downhill through      a drainage system that ranges from surface level to 200      feet deep, and that is often invisible to the naked eye.      Lo-tech systems are pretty much restricted to so-called      ground water at the surface in streams and lakes,      flowthrough permeable strata in the upper soil levels, or      where deep water aquifer, rise to the surface in springs or      marshes.    </p>    <p>      To prospect water from your easy chair, you can get      nautical charts for the Great Lakes, major rivers, and sea      coast from marine-supply outlets. Obtain in land      topographical maps and hydrological surveys from any good      outdoor sporting goods store, the local Cooperative      Extension Service, or direct from U.S. Dept. of the      Interior, Geological Survey, (800) 872-6277. The charts and      maps indicate water channels down to small periodic      streams, and the hydro stirveys chart sub-surface channels      and aquifers. Maps don't tell the whole store, however.      Much surface water is polluted by sewage, or by      agricultural and indus trial chemicals. Some aquifers are      near being pumped out, and the water table is dropping      beyond lo-tech accessibility. Parts of the San Joaquin      Valley of California have fallen 25 feet since pump ing      "fossil water" from the aquifer beneath had started in the      1920s. That particular day of reckoning is not far off.    </p>    <p>      In the end, you can supply surface or shallow-well water to      your place in three low-tech ways: 1. Catch it as it falls      as rain; 2. Tap an uphill source and pipe it down by      gravity; 3. Pump it up from a down- hill source.    </p>    <h3>      Rain Catchments    </h3>    <p>      My cabin site is a granite promontory high above a deep      water bay of the Gulf o f Maine. The soil is a yard deep at      most he fore it hits bedrock, and the nearest stream is a      quarter mile away and 100 feet downhill.    </p>    <p>      For warm-weather water, I have ,I three-part plan. As I did      in an earlier forest cabin, I'll attach wooden gutters      along, the eaves and pipe the flow to a pair of iron-hooped      wood-slat rain barrels set on the porch. The barrels, with      mosquitoproof tight wooden covers and hand dippers, will be      the first-stage water-supply system. Moss will grow around      the barrel rims and once mosquitoes are gone I can leave      the top ajar in the dryness of late summer. If you can't      find old-time wooden barrels locally, hardware or home      supply outlets sell them in several sizes-charred or      plain, used or new. Use clean, recycled steel drums or      plastic barrels (from any farm supply store) if you must,      but the water won't taste the same.    </p>    <h3>      PURIFYING WATER    </h3>    <p>      There's not as much wild water that's "good enough to      drink" as we used to think. Water flowing directly out of      rock from an uninhabited hillside has a good chance of      being pure. But even pristine mountain streams can contain      natural human pathogens such as Salmonella, and      Giardia-the parasite that causes Beaver Fever, a      dysentery-like disease that is misnamed, since wildlife      carriers got it from humans. Beware human habitation or      farm livestock upstream or uphill of any water source. But      even if you move to Georgian Bay or a Rocky Mountain      fastness, have your water tested before you use it raw.      States and provinces all offer water tests free or for a      nominal fee. The local health board or any well driller or      water softener will know where to go and how to take      samples. Tests are usually done for E. coli, the bacterium      that is normal in human stool. Request tests for everything      else the lab can do-heavy metals, pesticides if in a farm      area, worms, and other nasties.    </p>    <p>      Till you get a clean report-and for good if you      don't-you can boil water, use chlorine pills, get a      chlorinator or iodine infuser, or use a water filter. A      backpacker's filter will do for small quantities. The      Boundary Waters Catalog, at (800) 223-6565, carries a good      variety costing from $30 to $150. For long-term use, solar      stills or reverse-os mosis filters mentioned above are most      effective, but cost from several hundred to several      thousand dollars. One good source for reasonably priced      stills is Crystal Clear at (914) 754-8696.    </p>    <p>      You might consider importing water. Look in the old-car      magazines for a surplus military or industrial water      trailer-a "camel"-and fill it in town for a few      bucks. A lowflow household using only a few gallons a day      can fill their needs with plastic jugs of spring water from      the grocery for $1.00 a day, and much less if bought in      bulk.    </p>    <p>      Hand-built water systems are never finished, of course,      which is part of the fun. Another idea my son Sam and I are      working on is to make our own camel from a 1,200 lb. GVW      dual snowmobile/dirt bike trailer. It will hold three full      55-gallon steel drums. I'll equip it with a long siphon      hose or a little gas-powered transfer pump and get wild      water from a tested spring. Let's see, Harley doesn't drink      much and 150 gallons will supply our low-tee/lo-flow      requirements for four or five months ...more like a month      or two when we have visitors. I could build an insulated      shed on the cabin big enough to hold several drums over      winter ...and rig a solar fan to blow wood heat in to keep      the water from freezing. Over the centuries many have      solved the purification problem by drinking only hot-brewed      coffee and fermented spirits. I tried that myself, but      eventually found it counterproductive to the clean living      and clearthinking rationale that brought me to the country      in the first place, and can't recommend it.    </p>    <p>      After a summer on the place, I'll know how much rain to      expect and how much I'll use and will go to the second      stage: setting reconditioned 30-gallon steel drums up on      the rafters for a gravity water system. One will be rigged      to a hot water exchanger (for $200 ready-made, or homemade      from scrap copper tubing) that heats via natural convective      circulation. If the south side of the cabin gets a good      eight hours of sunlight, I'll set a black-painted 30-gallon      steel-drum hot water tank outside on a high stand outside      the bathroom (perhaps mated with the exchanger in the wood      stove) for the often necessary luxury of warm showers. Like      all homemade lotech water heaters, it will take a lot of      soldering, valving, and experimentation.    </p>    <p>      The final step will be to hire a backhoe to dig a      500-gallon cistern under the house's kitchen/bathroom      plumbing tier to supply a good four-month lo-flow winter      water supply. The eaves will empty into it, and a manual      valving system will direct water to the cistern, a      roof-cleaning bypass/ overflow. An insulated (perhaps      heat-tape warmed) pipe will run from the cistern to a hand      pump at the kitchen sink (see page 34) or I could use a      small 12VDC solarelectric pump to fill gravity tanks in the      roof. I may have to blast to dig the cistern and may have      to line it with stout plastic sheeting for water tightness.      We'll see. downcast Maine receives 50 inches of rain per      year-about 1,000 gal/month from a 400-square-foot roof, so      there's no concern about going dry.    </p>    <h3>      Go Tap a Spring    </h3>    <p>      Water flows under most of the continent through gravel and      sand layers (strata) deposited eons ago, often capped top      and bottom by impermeable clay strata sometimes flowing for      hundreds of miles from 50 to 200 feet down. It springs to      light in dips or where water-bearing strata or fissures in      the rocks just naturally break the surface. Look for green      spots in the woods or for willow lines on the plains.      Follow gulleys that betray faults or underground streams.      Track deer downhill from their night beds on the ridge tops      to where they water every morning in the draws.    </p>    <p>      Ideally, you will find a piece of land that slopes up      behind the house to a flowing spring. You can just dip one      end of a hose in a little pool, run it to the house, put a      spigot on the end, fill the tube from the top, and siphon      water down. If the spring flows strong enough, install a      pipe and let it run full-time. Best is to locate a dip that      has filled up with black muck over the centuries and dig it      out (dam the flow uphill and divert it temporarily if need      be). You can sink rocks or concrete blocks to anchor a      screened foot valve in the bottom. The valve will keep      trash out and guarantee one-way-only flow, but the hole      fills in quickly. Longerlasting is a yard-square covered      spring box-a crib of stout poles, or a caisson of      wood planks (that will last for years if kept saturated),      rock, or poured concrete. Run a pipe out the side and down      to the house. Cover the box well to keep leaves and other      woodsy trash out.    </p>    <p>      Mucking out a spring is the only work I enjoy more than      building stone walls. The muck stinks; it's full of bugs      and slimy rocks and buried limbs that spring up,      splattering you with black goop. But when it's done and the      swirls of mud gradually clear, you've presented the forest      with a new pool of clean, clear water never sampled by man      or beast. I like to make small waterfalls at the top and      bottom just to hear the sound.    </p>    <h3>      Tapping Lakes, Streams, and Rivers    </h3>                <p>      The main problem I've incurred in tapping natural water      bodies is keeping the inlet pipe stable against wave action      and changing currents, free of silt and waterborne trash,      and firmly sunk below changing water levels. The best      solution I know is to make an inlet box to hold a foot      valve or strainer. Often a single concrete block will do.      You may have to get so elaborate as to dig a pit in the      bottom and halfsubmerge a wooden box and hold it in place      by filling with river stones (see page 34). Fashioning the      inlet from plastic plumbing pipe fixtures to make a "T" or      a rigid crook with the opening facing away from prevailing      current often helps to give it purchase, remain above      bottom silt, and reject floating leaves and trash (see page      H2). Rigid PVC pipe used to fabricate drains and junctions      comes in a variety of shapes and can be welded easily with      solvent. In some situations, a floating inlet is best-with      the tubing suspended from a plastic-foam float anchored to      the bottom.    </p>    <p>      If water is silty or choked with weeds or algae-sometimes,      even if it is stagnant and foul-you can employ an old      woodsman's trick and dig a sump beside it, about a foot      away in sandy soil, half that in denser soil. Water will      filter through, cleaning itself as it fills the sump to the      level of the water body. The sump can be quite deep, so      long as the dike separating sump from pond or stream holds.      Sapling poles and stakes or steel mesh and re-bar used for      reinforcing concrete can be hammered or laid around the      sides to strengthen the sump. A cover is necessary to keep      out trash. I have used a plastic tarp held up with poles,      margins weighted with stones and the sheet punched through      several places to allow rainwater to seep through. For a      permanent sump cover, build a wood, poured-concrete, or      concrete-block frame around the top and fashion a hinged or      removable wooden top as when making a spring box.    </p>		       <p>      If your water source is below the house, you'll want to      pump the water up. If you're lucky enough to live beside a      stream in hill country, and the waterway drops two to 50      feet over a relatively short distance, you can use a water      ram. This elegantly simple device uses gravity expressed in      the momentum of a falling water column to pump water      uphill. A relatively small amount of water from a flowing      stream is diverted into a catch basin, then to a pipe and      downhill. In the ram, its momentum is captured between a      pair of oppositeworking valves with a closed-top pressure      vessel (metal bulb or plastic tube) between them.      Momentum-forced water enters the vessel, compressing the      air, the inlet-side valve closes, trapping energized water,      compressed air in the vessel expands, forcing a jet of      water past the outlet-side valve which closes when the      water spurts past and recoils back against it. But most of      the energized water is trapped ahead of the valve, so up      goes your water supply in successive spurts.    </p>    <p>      The secret to a water ram is the amount of "head" the      stream offers, a term refer ring to the difference in depth      of a liquid at two given points and to the higher pressure      at the lower point.    </p>    <p>      Since it plummets straight down for 167 feet., Niagara      Falls develops 167 feet of head over a negligible amount of      forward progress. With its one-foot-per-mile fall rate, the      Mississippi needs 167 miles to develop the same head.    </p>    <p>      The inlet can be as little as two feet higher than the      outlet, but the more head, the more water can be moved. The      best way to get enough head to lift water a meaningful      height (the "rise") over a reasonable overland distance is      to pick a site with a vigorous mountain stream running just      downhill from your place.<br />    </p>    <h3>      HAND-DRILLED WELLS    </h3>        <p>      I've never dug a real well, and don't suggest your doing      it. But if you are restoring an old farmstead, do scout      around for the old wells. One for the house and another for      the barn are bound to be there someplace-hidden under a      flat rock in the yard, on the machine-shed side of the barn      away from the stock pens, or under the porch. Many were      filled, broken in, or capped with concrete for      cat/dog/little kid safety's sake after a deep well was      drilled, but they'll still produce water in sufficient      quantity for a lo-flow system. Many homes from the 1800s      were built over springs, so it might be worth your while to      listen for a faint burble underneath the floor boards. If      it's there, you'll hear it, even under a concrete floor. If      you strike it rich, sink a pipe and attach a hand pump.    </p>    <p>      As with nearly all ground water, old wells need testing.      And expect the water level to fluctuate with the seasons.      My kids were whelped on a cellar well that got low enough      one fall to force a reluctant shift from cloth diapers to      disposable for a few weeks. (I'm told that modern-day      disposable are less of a burden on the environment than the      combined water use and detergent contamination from      laundering cloth diapers. My youngest is in college,      however, and I have no present inclination to test the      theory by going back into the diaper business.    </p>    <p>      Don't expect to bring up water by hammering down one of the      those strainer ended hollow-pipe well points you see in      catalogs unless neighbors's wells or a hydrologic survey      confirms presence of a clean, shallow aquifer that remains      fully charged year-round. Only if the free water level is      no more than 20 feet below the surface, and the ground is      rock-free and easily penetrable down to water, can a      hand-sunk point get to it. Sandy soils near large      fresh-water bodies are best, and the nearer lake level the      well mouth the better; hand pumping from much more than 10      feet down takes a lot of muscle.    </p>    <p>      Those gas-engined post-hole diggers cobbled up with      mini-water-well drills and advertised to bring water up      from "deep-rock" wells ...won't. I've seen excited buyers      bouncing the foolish things around, trying to get the auger      to bite. When it did, and jammed hard on the first buried      rock, the powerhead twisted out of their hands and stalled,      sometimes inflicting a modicum of injury in the process.      These rigs have a water inlet under the engine; you are      supposed to hook up a water hose that sends pressurized      water down the pipe drill stem to force up the cuttings. If      there's water available to drill, why are you drilling? The      drillers supply theirs from a tank truck as big as a      swimming pool.    </p>    <p>      If soil is sandy and rock-free far enough down for a      several-hundred-dollar gas-powered drill to work, so will a      $50 well point and $20 drilling cap and a few dollars of      plumbing pipe and junctions-hand driven in an      afternoon with a sledge.    </p>    <p>      The chart above gives output up 100 feet of rise for a      one-inch-ID bronze ram at several head figures. At least      four gallons/minute of flow are needed to operate a      one-inch ram.    </p>    <p>      Rams come in several sizes and in PC: plumbing pipe as well      as metal. A top-quality one-inch metal ram costs $500. A      build-it-yourself kit of instructions and the only two      moving components for a one-inch plastic ram costs less      than $50, or you can get one ready to pump for under $100.      To the cost of your ram, you must add cost of pipe from the      inlet down to the ram, and back up hill to your home, barn      or stock-watering tank.    </p>    <p>      You will find details in the catalogs. If you are seriously      interested in the less expensive water rams, you can go to      the source and request a catalog from The Ram Co., (800)      227-8511. The Cumberland General Store sells metal rams in      its $3.00 catalog, (800) 334-4640.    </p>    <p>      More than any device I know, a water ram represents that      rare thing-a perfectly clean, purely beneficial      technology. Rig it to fill overhead tanks for a      gravitypowered pressure system. Then, with woodstove or      sun-heated hot water, and piping your cooking and shower      water out to irrigate the garden, you'll have a water      system that is environmentally benign.    </p>    <p>      Another environmentally neutral option-more      "appropriate-tech" than low-tech-is one of the      solar-powered pumps that are replacing windmills at many      stock tanks in the West. Best for sunny climates, although      all solar panels lose efficiency in high heat, they      function 40 percent more efficiently in summer if mounted      on a solar-activated sun-tracker.    </p>    <p>      Deep-well rigs use a pair of $200 to $300 photo-voltaic      panels and a $500 submergible jet pump to move 100      gallons/hour up a 25-foot head (25 feet straight up or      hundreds of feet of dis tance). Or, they will move some 50      GPH against a 200-foot head. Plan to spend $1,500 to $2,000      for the panels, mount, battery, pump, and controller. A      solar tracker adds another $500. Piping, foot valves, and      strainers must be chosen to fit the use, and cost extra,      but not a lot. Submersible pumps are designed to go down      inside the casing of a drilled well, but can be adapted for      shallow water sources where the head is great.    </p>    <p>      For pulling lesser quantities of water up from shallow      wells, cisterns, and lakes, you can power a $50 to $150      multi-piston diaphragm pump with one solar panel on a      simple frame, $15 worth of fittings, and hose as needed.      They can pump three or four gallons a minute up to 60 feet      above the pump, and can pressurize your home water system      to boot. Diaphragms wear out, but are easy to replace.    </p>    <p>      Getting in low-tech water during the hard winters we have      in snow country is a challenge. Exposed water rams,      intermittent pumps, and pipes will freeze solid, and only      if the above-ground appliances are frost-proofed will a      shallow well or cistern produce all winter. If the source      remains open all winter, you can build a well-insulated      well house over ram or pump and bury supply pipes below the      frost line. With 110 VAC electricity or a high-output      alternative electricity you can install heaters or heat      tapes to keep the system thawed.    </p>    <p>      Fast-moving water won't freeze, though, and a constant flow      can be maintained through insulated pipes from below the      surface of a stream or lake. You need an outflow for the      surplus (and for gray water), though, or you'll have a      glacier built up by April. Best is a flowing spring in the      cellar-which requires foresight in locating your dwelling.    </p>    <h3>      Desalinators    </h3>    <p>      Of course, snow won't flow off my cabin roof, and I may try      using sea water. Modern passive technology offers two ways      to use sea brine-or any water that is foul, alkaline,      or even polluted. Solar stills ranging in output from a      half-gallon to two gallons/day will evaporate pure water      out from foul or saltwater, but need sun all day, so are      most efficient in the lower latitudes. Prices range from      $350 to $800 for the nearly indestructible, freeze-proof      flat-plate stills. A sun-activated automatic feeder will      add $200 and a special reservoir another $300 to $750.      Along with other off the-grid systems, stocked by Kansas      Wind Power, 13569 214th Road, Holton KS 66436-8138.    </p>        <p>      Marine desalinators use reverse-osmosis to remove 98      percent of all impurities from one to eight gallons/hour of      salt or contaminated water. They come in manual and 12VDC      power versions at a price of $500 to $1,700. You must spend      the better part of $100 to replace the membrane      periodically. I'd get one for the life raft on my boat      before I take it offshore, and will ask it to do double      duty if my son Sam and I can figure out a way to rig a      water ram to use wave and tide energy to pump salt water up      to the cabin for winter. The fresh water in sea brine      doesn't freeze to slush or sea ice if kept agitated.    </p>    <p>      The ram may not cooperate, but Old Dog Harley and I have      melted snow on the wood stove through more winters than      one. We came through with both our coats a bit on the gamy      side, but otherwise in fine shape. I'll admit, however that      when life falls (or maybe it rises?) to that lo-tech level,      just keeping body and soul together becomes a full-time      job.    </p>    <h3>      The Noble Earth Closet    </h3>    <p>      Properly managed, an outhouse recycles human waste      perfectly, converting it directly into soil nutrients with      no fossil fuel, no water pollution, and a net positive      effect on the environment. An outhouse is even better for      the user's psyche. It's humbling when we can't flush away      the daily reminder that we're not all that superior to the      family dog, who performs natural functions without the      modesty and inhibition, guilt or shame that we experience.    </p>    <p>      Health codes in most rural areas of the country fail to      address earth closets, or are tolerant if they do. But      privies are sitting targets for a certain brand of newcomer      from town who feel it a right and duty to raise the      cultural level of the locals. In Vermont, yuppies have      infested the mountains with ski resorts that suck the      aquifers dry to make snow and with condos that refill them      with septic effluent. In Maine, they've ringed crystalline      glacial ponds, once sparsely populated by the locals's      privyequipped fishing shacks, with hipto-hip upscale      cottages whose hip-to-hip septics emit phosphors that      nourish weeds that turn pristine trout waters into frog      swamps. And durned if Clean-Green do-good ers in both      states aren't ignoring the problems they've brought with      them, and are cooking up legislation to regulate the      privies that are all the plumbing that many older country      folks have ever known and all that back-country poor can      afford.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to check the law before you dig. No, check before      you so much as consider buying a place. Any rural      municipality that sends the privy police around is liable      to zone privies out of town and won't tolerate      lo-tech/lo-flow water systems or interesting people for      long.    </p>    <p>      Locate your privy out of sight of snoopers of all      persuasions, well downshed from any open water and from the      source of your own water supply-almost always downhill. To      assay drainage, wait for a good rain to soak in. Dig a      three-footdeep post hole with sharply cut sides; the upflow      side will seep water most persistently.    </p>    <p>      Old-time wisdom says to locate an outhouse at least 60 feet      from your water source-100 feet in sandy, fast-percolating      soil. Over that distance, soil microbes will purify any      effluent that escapes the pit. Dig into an old pit      sometime. Inside will be rich compost. Around the perimeter      you'll see a dark rind of super-rich soil that was once      full of anaerobic microbes that purified the effluent      before it got more than a few inches out into the soil.    </p>    <p>      Pit and well can be closer if separated by an impermeable      barrier-say, by a bedrock outcropping or a house      foundation. I lived in a place once where the 100-year-old      cesspool and shallow well were only 15 feet      apart-separated by the cellar hole and walls. There      was never a problem.    </p>    <p>      Build your privy according to whim or from one of the books      available from alternative-lifestyle publishers. Be sure to      make all seams bug-proof and bank spoil from the pit inside      and out, around the sides, and stomp well to keep odors in      and critters out.    </p>    <p>      Install storm-sash gasketing so the seats are airtight.      Drill vent holes in front panel under the seat at floor      level and cover with fine-mesh screening. Install a      black-painted vent tube (stovepipe or a long wood box)      leading from the back of the seat to a yard above the roof      against a white-painted rear wall facing the sun. It will      evacuate odor by passive convection and aerate the pit for      faster, aerobic, less pungent composting. A wind turbine or      solar fan will vent even more effectively. A little 12VDC      muffin fan and a small solar panel cost about $100 and work      when the sun shines-or with a larger solar panel, a      controller, and a battery, will run full time and supply a      privy light if you want it. A wind turbine used with      commercial non-electric composting toilets costs about 30      bucks and runs when the wind blows. See the solar-goods      catalogs that advertise in MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Dig your pit as deep as you can manage, but not down to      standing water. If you can't get down four feet without      hitting water, dig shallow and rig carrying poles on each      side of the house so two people can move the house several      times a year.    </p>    <p>      My next privy will be a deluxe model featuring a solar fan      with a large solar panel and battery to power a night-light      and a quick-heating propane-fueled catalytic heater for      four-season comfort. Sears no longer publishes their      catalog so I'll supply biodegradable toilet paper sold for      chemical toilets. Its more expensive than Charmin, but      decomposes quickly. A bookshelf, battery-powered radio, and      a container of wetwipe disposable hand cleansers completes      the furnishings.    </p>    <p>      The one aspect of privy management that can't be automated      or euphemized away is stirring. Hinge the seat and keep a      large stick down in the hole where you can reach the good      end. Whenever you can muster the strength, stir and spread      the contents. Remember, humility is a virtue.    </p>    <p>      In most soils, a 3' x 3' x 5' deep pit should serve a small      household for a year without problem. Many seasonal or      limiteduse outhouses have served from the same location for      decades. But, if the pit threatens to fill or become      unpleasant from heavy use, dig another one uphill and to      one side and move the house. Fill in the old pit and plant      a lilac bush over the spot. Late fall is the best time so      you'll have plenty of pit space for winter.    </p>    <p>      For best composting, keep a coffee can and a large      container of dry soil, peat moss, pine needles or other      organic material by the seat and instruct all users to drop      in a half-container full with each use. If space to      relocate the privy is limited, or you experience brief      heavy usage from visitors, you can scatter quick-lime or      caustic soda in the pit every day. It will keep odors down      and speed disintegration.    </p>    <p>      To minimize insect problems, be sure to screen all      openings, fashion a good tight door with a closing spring,      and keep the toilet lid down and bug-tight. And don't throw      garden refuse or kitchen garbage into the pit. You don't      want to introduce eggs that will encourage fruit flies.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you'll not want to run to the outhouse at all      hours. Get some old-time chamber pots-ample crocks      cast from easily cleaned gloss-glazed porcelain. With or      without a bit of rose water in the bottom and covered      discreetly with a towel, they are a perfectly civilized      alternative to a midnight stroll to the facilities.    </p>    <h3>      Waterless Indoor Plumbing    </h3>    <p>      Composting toilets are indoor versions of the earth closet,      but are carefully designed to turn human waste, kitchen      scraps and peat moss into bug- and eggkilling,      human-pathogen disinfecting, hotprocess compost. They come      with or without elec tric heat and vent fans to improve      both capacity and process, and incorporate internal      agitating mechanisms to keep true aerobic compost cooking.      Silent, sanitary, aesthetic, waterless, and fully Code      Acceptable in a growing number of rural municipalities,      they cost about $1,000. You'll agree they're worth it the      first time you don't have to mush to the outhouse in a cold      rain. The best are made in Canada. See the catalogs and ads      in MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      Composting toilets, DC batteries for a solar array, and the      water supply need to be kept warm in winter. When I get up      the money to luxuriate in off-the-grid decadence and      luxury, I will buy a propanepowered refrigerator and      ondemand water heater and install them in the kitchen      counter that backs against the bathroom wall. Their warm      exhaust will do double duty, venting through finned stove      pipe run through a Code-acceptable sealed battery locker,      into and through the toilet space, and between      gravity-water tanks packed in insulation up in the ceiling.    </p>    <h3>      Graywater    </h3>    <p>      Small amounts of cooking and wash      water-"graywater"-can just be tossed on the      lawn or garden. If the outflow becomes noticeable, it's      both unaesthetic and illegal in most places, so it should      be run into a sump or dry well, a leach pit, or set of each      lines. A sump for a single-sink outflow need be nothing but      a hole in the ground with a flat rock over it and the drain      hose leading in. A dry well is larger, to accept water from      a shower and sink. One version is a yarddeep hole lined      with a planks set on end and half-filled with gravel or      crushed rock and the end of the drain pipe sunk halfway      down. A proper leach pit can be as large as needed to serve      laundry, sinks, shower or bathtub. Build a yard-wide      cylinder of concrete blocks with a foot of gravel at the      bottom and six inches all around; lay the drain line      underground and cover the pit with planks. Or, cover with a      concrete cistern cap and cover that with sod and never      worry about it unless it overflowswhich means it needs to      be dug out or moved.    </p>    <p>      Maybe it's the Red Indian in me, but I find more than fluid      nourishment in a handbuilt water system ...living life not      as a consumer but as an active participant in the      sun-powered water cycle.<br />    </p>    <h3>      THE NOBLE EARTH CLOSET    </h3>    <p>      <em><strong>Properly managed, an outhouse recycles      perfectly, converting waste directly into nutrients.<br />      <br /></strong></em>    </p>
