                        <p><strong>The strength of tending house and home alone.</strong></p>		<h5 id="byline">By Deanna Kawatski</h5>    <p>      Throughout my childhood, summer and Nanny's log house on      the hill above the waters of Shuswap Lake were synonymous.      The dwelling, which was built by my grandparents in 1930,      was painted canary yellow on the outside with plaster      between the logs. It was half-surrounded by a roofed-in      Virginia creeper woven porch. Alternately perched and      sprawled there, on boards routinely swept with a wet broom      by Nanny, I found one of my favorite places on Earth. Now      and then, the dancing of leaf shadow on the pages of      <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> or <em>What Kady Did</em> would be      enough to send me into a trance, broken only by my twin      sister's foot tapping. As a child Donna hated to read, but      what we shared in the cool, roomy house was a haven.    </p>    <p>      At Nanny's I also entered the dichotomy, of a farm ceasing      to function while the land remains in all its glory. Since      Nanny's husband Papa Bert died, the barn stood empty and      the root cellar had begun to collapse. Despite the decay,      bumblebees swam their slow wake through a world of emerald      grass, clover, and plantain while the aroma of cottonwood      buds, cherry blossoms, and fresh-turned earth drifted      across the yard.    </p>    <p>      Nanny did her best to endow me with domestic smarts, but I      was happiest romping with my sister through the field      toward the unpruned orchard where robins and warblers sang.      Before long a plaintive call of, "Come, girls, where are      you?" would waft across from the porch. While Nanny's      outside voice was frail and distinctly feminine, inside she      was capable of a good, solid bellow if necessary. So we'd      scamper back.    </p>        <p>      In those days Nanny seemed tall, elegant, and capable. Her      silver hair hung in clouds beside her full, worry-laden      checks. Nanny had beautiful hands and a light touch at the      piano where she played songs, like Mendelssohn's "Woodland      Echoes." The deafness that had afflicted her sine the age      of 30 played havoc with her sense of tone. A cord traveled      in tributaries to her ears from a small gold box nestled in      her bosom. It squealed horrendously, and she would yank it      out and spin it in frantic attempts to tune in the world.    </p>    <p>      Nanny's love manifested itself in work. Even her barking      was an expression of love for us, the wayward pups. With      sound heels she would march across the hardwood expanse,      broom in hand, armed against any insurgence of dust      kittens.    </p>    <p>      If Nanny wasn't latching the handle onto a freshly heated      flatiron, ready to dash it across the surface of every      scrap of laundry right down to the underwear and dish rags,      then she was at the baking table. She stood in her pink      housedress kneading bread, beating cake, and rolling out      what Nanny, her son Don, and a boarder in the 1930s.      amounted through the years to thousands of pies.    </p>    <p>      There was often the smell of paste wax and simmering; pot      roast, and the order to <strong>"STAY OF THE KITCHEN      FLOOR!"</strong> as we sped past, the slam of the screen      door igniting a flurry of flies. On her hands and knee,      with her housedress hoisted and tucked in, for the      thousandth time, Nanny would scrub and wax the kitchen      floor, the seam of her nylon stockings advancing backwards      across the citrus-toned linoleum.    </p>        <p>      She had never in her life donned trousers. She would      wrinkle her nose at our jeans and say <em>"ish"</em> Then      scold, "Why don't you girls ever wear dresses? Gosh, what      awful pants!" We'd end the discussion by wheeling away.    </p>    <p>      Nanny gave us a sense of order. One of her mottoes was "a      place for everything and everything in its place." She also      gave us a strong sense of love. She didn't have a career.      Her purpose and passion was her house, and the energy that      she brought to cooking and cleaning could have matched the      gusto of any top-flight executive. With two children of my      own to care for, and the thousand details I have to shape      into the four walls of our home, only now can I appreciate      Nanny's care of that cabin.    </p>    <p>      Nancy Parkinson also lives alone in a hilltop home looking      over Shuswap Lake, though I've no doubt my grandmother      would have regarded her 33-foot post-and-beam adobe castle      with some degree of alarm. After all, in this climate, moss      sways from the trees and the earth can vanish for months      beneath a shawl of snow. But as Nancy says, despite much      popular theorizing to the contrary, "Adobe works, even in      cool, wet regions."    </p>    <p>      As I enter her house, unassuming from the outside, I see      what she means. From my vantage point in the 12' x 16'      kitchen I see that the house has evolved into a cozy,      peaceful three levels. In contrast to the densely forested      laid, the white adobe walls conjure up visions of untouched      desert spaces.    </p>    <p>      A petite five foot one inches, Nancy assures me "you don't      have to be big or strong to build a house." She describes      her upbringing as small town, bereft of both city smarts      and country smarts. "My dad wasn't a Mr. Fixit kind of      guy," she told me. "I didn't know the difference between a      saw and a hammer until I came out here."    </p>        <p>      After earning a degree in psychology from the University of      Guelph in Ontario, Nancy departed for B.C. with a friend      and began what she called her "second childhood," in which      she learned about all she could do for herself. For two      years she lived in a tepee on land owned collectively, and      despite no small amount of hardship, she was determined to      stay. When she lost that home, building her own seemed the      only option, but, she says, "There's nothing trickier than      saying you're going to do something when you have no idea      how."    </p>    <p>      It was her affinity for bent trees that lured her to her      present site. At the outset Nancy had to save for two weeks      simply to buy a hammer. Then for the next three years she      spent half her year in a puny $50 trailer and worked in      Vancouver during the winter in order to save enough money      for a truck. She wandered the alleys scavenging potential      building materials.    </p>    <p>      Inspired by her neighbors, Eric and Diane Lutjen, who had      built a house of mud brick, Nancy settled on adobe, a      method that takes much time but next to no money. She made      her own bricks and kept track of every penny. "The original      28' x 14' house cost $3,000 when I moved in. All my lumber      was seconds and I framed with two-by-sixes." She avoided      using traditional 2 x 4s in order to accommodate a sod      roof. Sod is a great insulator. but is tremendously heavy.    </p>    <p>      For the first year, house building be came an obsession      with Nancy. She thought, breathed, and dreamed it, and was      initially fanatical that she do ever thing herself. The      neighbor who dug the building site let Nancy run the      excavator and she felled every tree with a chain saw. She      did grudgingly allow Eric Lutjen to pull the logs over to      the building site by horse without her assistance.    </p>    <p>      Even so, gaining the respect of local builders was another      matter. She remembers the looks of skepticism at the hard      ware store when she announced her intention to build an      adobe house. "I learned to get eye contact and keep it like      little barnacle and I followed them around until I got what      I wanted."    </p>    <p>      A worker at the local gravel pit where she went to get      rocks for her foundation offered to haul a truckload up the      hill for her. But when she arrived home she found he had      ignored her "Put Them Here" sign and dumped not one but two      truck loads-a hill of rock-right on top of her      building site. Nancy proceeded to remove every rock so that      she could continue working. Some were so large they could      only be rolled. The joker chuckled for years over this.    </p>    <p>      Nancy believes her ignorance was a gift. "When I had a      problem to solve, the solution could come from any      direction rather than simply the one dictated by tradition.      I was this wide-open book."    </p>    <p>      The original house was framed with a hand saw. Later Nancy      went to work as a cook for a log builder and, due to her      keenness, was taken out of the kitchen and put on the crew.      She became adept with a chain saw. Instead of tossing salad      and frying steaks she learned to cut notches and to      flatside logs.    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, the most difficult part of the entire      building process came at the very beginning. She was      plagued by nightmares, and her failed attempts to build a      sawhorse drove her to despair. If she couldn't build a      sawhorse, how could she possibly build a house? She sought      the ad vice of Jannis, another female builder in the      community, and Jannis advised her to "just keep plugging      along." Nancy repeated this motto like a mantra for four      years.    </p>    <p>      From the time that Nancy laid the first rock in 1981, it      was a solid year of work before she was living in her      house. At that point, one wall was her old tepee canvas,      but it was good enough for shelter. It was complete to the      point that "regular folk would live in it" in three years.    </p>    <p>      Nancy holds a certain reverence for mud brick. "It might be      because they have such a part-of-the-flesh feel to them,      and so much of you goes into each and every brick. If      you're a person that likes curves and shape, clay is the      way to go.    </p>    <p>      "You don't have to live in Mexico to make adobe brick work.      The material is totally accessible and cheap. You don't      have to take out a 30-year mortgage simply to have a house.      And it doesn't check, twist, rot, or burn." To top it off,      this substance doesn't put further pressure on our      declining forests. Even so, Nancy admits that if there were      strictly enforced zoning codes in her town, she could have      run into problems. She adds, "There are bylaws that need to      be changed to allow for this material in many areas. Don't      just start making bricks or you're likely to hit some      serious snags. Ask questions."    </p>    <p>      Sand provides the strength of the brick, clay provides the      bond. After hoeing first the clay, then sand through a      one-quarterinch mesh screen, Nancy mixed the two together,      sprinkling in water until it was of pie dough consistency.      She then put the mixture into a brick maker-a metal box      with a long handle on it-which compressed the material. She      claims it becomes intuitive after the first 100 bricks.      Stacked to allow air flow and left to cure for one month,      the bricks were then laid in place with a trowel and a      looser mortar mix. One of her most important tools was a      level, which enabled her to keep the bricks in line.    </p>    <p>      The south facing wall is two bricks thick with a space      between them. Two hundred colored glass bottles are      embedded in the wall. Nancy lucked upon them at a recycling      depot on a trip to California. Getting the wax out of them      wasn't easy, but clay adapts well to the bottles, which are      not only decorative but also double paned. That insulation      is an absolute must here in the land of the six-month      winter.    </p>        <p>      Because of demands such as a roof and the need to close in      the walls, Nancy didn't begin work on the chimney until      late in the construction process-and late in the year. Had      she done it in the summer it would have taken three days.      Instead it took three weeks.    </p>    <p>      Nancy recalls, "Twenty below and I was out pick-axing the      sand and dirt because it was frozen. I had to melt snow for      water." Not only did she burn her hands with the lime, she      also put her back out. "The chimney became a monument to      strength," and as work progressed, many people dropped by      with advice and help with the roof and floor. The town's      skepticism was slowly lifting.    </p>    <p>      After I ask the obvious question, she chuckles, "This may      be a castle of sand, but you can hose it down and you're      not going to wash it away." Even so, as a precaution, Nancy      opted for a four-foot overhang on her roof.    </p>    <p>      Now leaning back and reflecting, Nancy smiles, "At first a      home is all grunt work and you're not getting any returns.      But there's a point you reach in every project where the      project takes you over. You're not having to think so hard      about it anymore because, in a sense, it's thinking you.      Some other energy or creative force is running you. At this      point, you know you're the servant of this thing and you      become humble:'    </p>    <p>      Nancy creates as she goes along. Often she wanders about      her yard looking at odds and ends without any preconceived      notion of how she will use them. "I try to keep my mind      open. When I look at a tin can it's no longer a tin can.      It's a cylinder with untapped building potential. It's      exciting and invigorating that this process can't be put      down on a blueprint."    </p>    <p>      A few years ago when Nancy was diagnosed with cancer, she      felt like a stranger as she stepped back into her own house      from a stint in the hospital. Her awe for the structure she      had built gradually gave her the strength to proceed with      the surgery that cured her. "Many times now I've pulled      building that house out of my back pocket and put it in      front of my face to give me the strength to take the next      hurdle."    </p>    <p>      To her, 90 percent of the benefits of house building were      spiritual. "In the normal female experience of life, we put      out a huge amount of energy that is invisible. We don't see      the huge pyramid of dishes that we've washed, the mountain      of diapers we've changed. We end up with this enormous      invisible that we can't touch. What a woman needs in her      life is something visible that she has done."    </p>    <p>      My thoughts drift back to my grandmother. What would she      have done if confronted with the miles of floors, the      mountain of laundry, she had scrubbed in her lifetime?    </p>    <p>      ...I see her standing in a field in a pink dress and      essential broad-brimmed hat. At the center gleams a      colossal pyramid. Every dish she ever washed has solidified      into a massive china monument in her honor. I see her smile      softly, shake her head in amazement, then the words fly      forth, "Gosh, isn't it awful?"    </p>    <p>      ...But the words can't extinguish the glow of pride.    </p>
