                    <p><strong>      Herbal Remedies    </strong></p>            <p>      As you walk down the aisles of your local drugstore seeing      the array of brightly colored bottles and boxes whose      contents are designed to treat an almost endless variety of      ailments, could you ever imagine them as flowers once      growing on a forest floor or as bark cut from one of its      trees? Is there even a remote relationship between the life      of the woods and the bottles on the shelf?    </p>    <p>      The nationally known author and environmental scientist G.      Tyler Miller tells us that in America one of every four      drugs sold either over-the-counter or by prescription has      its origin in plant life. From the chemicals developed by      nature have actually come 25 percent of all our      medications. In some nations the percentage is as high as      50. There is a pharmacy in the forest.    </p>    <p>      The history of the relationship between products from      living plants and healing medications goes back to the very      beginnings of medicine itself. There are museum records of      prescriptions dating back to Egypt in 3700 B.C. Their work      was followed by the Chinese, and later, Greek and Roman      medicine came into its own. By 600 A.D. the Arab world had      developed a health care system while scientific medicine      and pharmacy began to flourish in Europe in the eighth      century.    </p>        <p>      The American experience is deeply rooted in the lore of      Native Americans. Indian nations from coast to coast      developed a considerable volume of knowledge of natu ral      substances and used them with great success in treating      their sick. The first official compendium (called a      Pharmacopeia) was published in 1778, just two years      following the American Revolution. By 1787, an American      physician, Dr. Schoepf, had published his Materia Medica      Americana, listing not only European remedies, but also      dozens of drugs coming from our indigenous plants.      Information regarding their preparation and uses had come      largely from the accumulated knowledge of native American      medicine men.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately the relationship between these natural      products and viable healing drugs was to suffer an image      problem when those motivated by quick profit got into the      act. The many Western movies with their portrayal of the      traveling medicine show and its list of "cures for what      ails you" wasn't a fabrication but an actual and dominant      part of the medical scene. Lost in the vaudeville shuffle      of questionable oils and tinctures was the fact that      hundreds of pharmaceutical manufactures and dedicated      physicians continued to produce and dispense medications      which served to improve the health of our people. Many of      these medications came from plant sources and were very      effective.    </p>    <p>      What follows are nine of my favorite natural remedies with      a history of usage that may go back hundreds, or even      thousands, of years. Unfortunately, we've largely distanced      ourselves from many of them as they found their way onto      drugstore shelves as active ingredients of highly      sophisticated (and very often artificially expensive)      medicines. Yet the plants and the cures are ours to grow.    </p>    <h3>      Yarrow    </h3>    <p>      One quite versatile and commonly encountered wound healer      is the yarrow plant, botanically know as Achillea      millefollium. Belonging to the Composite family, it carries      such common names as bloodwart, milfoil, sanguinary,      stanchgrass, and thousand-leaf. Yarrow is native to Europe,      but has been naturalized in most temperate regions of the      United States, and can be found in fields, roadsides, and      other open places. Its usage in medicine goes back to the      ancient Greeks, who employed it in the treatment of cuts,      wounds, burns, and bruises. Its genus name, Achillea,      refers to the hero Achilles in Homer's Iliad, who is said      to have used it on his soldiers's wounds. Yarrow was also      used in the Middle Ages and appears in many English herbal      notebooks of that day. The Navajo of the United States have      also employed it for healing purposes.    </p>    <p>      You can prepare a poultice of yarrow by mixing ground-up      yarrow tips in onequarter cup hot water with a few      teaspoons each of glycerin, boric acid, and oil of      wintergreen. This results in a soft semiliquid that, when      applied to an infected area, tends to draw the infectious      material from diseased tissues because of its absorptive      properties.    </p>    <h3>      Pumpkin    </h3>        <p>      In autumn across a large part of North America, cultivated      pumpkins are seen in fields, heralding the start of fall.      The pumpkin belongs to the gourd family and is a cousin of      squashes and zucchinis.    </p>    <p>      When the first explorers arrived in America, they noticed      the pumpkins in the cultivated corn fields of the Indians      who had long since discovered their medicinal value.      Although native to tropical America, the pumpkin has been      cultivated almost everywhere in the world.    </p>    <p>      According to the American Pharmaceutical Association,      pumpkin seeds are a proven anthelmintic, which is a      substance that kills intestinal worms and expels them from      the body. An excellent preparation that is not only      excellent for tapeworms but also as a diuretic promoting      regular passage of urine can be made by grinding up several      ounces of pumpkin seeds and placing them in a small cup of      corn syrup, which is flavored with oil of cinnamon.    </p>    <p>      Laxatives are prominent on grocery and drugstore shelves,      but many of them treat the bowels harshly. The seeds of the      psyllium plant are the natural way to handle this problem.    </p>        <p>      Psyllium, also known as fleaseed, fleawort, and plantain,      is native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western      Asia. and is also cultivated in North America. It is an      annual herb growing up to 15 inches tall with narrow      lance-shaped leaves growing in opposite pairs and whorls of      three to six. Its habitat is usually poor soils and waste      places in full sun.    </p>    <p>      Psyllium has long been used as an intestinal lubricant and      laxative. The best way of making use of this herbal      medicine is to soak an ounce of seeds in water for a couple      of hours before taking. The gum of the seeds soaks up the      water and provides both bulk and softness to the bowels,      working as a nature-based alternative to the harshness of      many commercial preparations.    </p>    <h3>      Tea for Stomach Irritation    </h3>    <p>      Heartburn and gastritis (inflammation of the gastric      mucosa), both of which are caused by excess stomach acid,      are almost always chronically recurring disorders. Three to      five cups of this tea daily will bring gradual but      effective relief. It is best to space out the drinking of      this tea over the whole day.    </p>    <p>      8 parts angelica root<br />      4 parts chamomile flowers<br />      4 parts balm leaves<br />      4 parts peppermint leaves<br />      2 parts caraway seed<br />      2 parts fennel seed<br />      1 part wormwood    </p>    <h3>      Privet    </h3>    <p>      Who of us hasn't experienced a sore throat that doesn't      seem to want to go away? We try over-the-counter remedies      that appear somewhat ineffective when we could be tapping      into nature's drugstore for a time-tested source of relief.      One of these sources is the privet, a plant transported to      North America for cultivation as a hedge and readily      available at most nurseries. Its abundant leaves form a      thick screen and if the plant is allowed to grow it can,      like psyllium, reach 15 feet in height.    </p>    <p>      The privet belongs to the olive family and grows well from      the Canadian border south to Pennsylvania and North      Carolina. It has lance-shaped-to-elliptical leaves which      are smooth and dark green and grow in opposite pairs.      Numerous small white flowers appear during the summer,      appearing in terminal clusters, followed by the development      of black berries.    </p>    <p>      The privet has a solid reputation as a medicinal plant,      particularly as a gargle for sore throat. To prepare this      herbal medicine, simply boil a cup of ground privet leaves      in a pan of water, then filter through a cloth and when the      extract has cooled down, use as a throat gargle.    </p>    <h3>      Meadowsweet    </h3>    <p>      Every time you reach for an aspirin you owe a debt to the      plant called mead owsweet, for it was this herb from which      salicylic acid was first obtained. Salicylates found in the      flowers of the meadowsweet are the basis of its      longstanding reputation as a remedy for flu, rheumatism,      arthritis, and fevers.    </p>        <p>      The herb grows from Canada south to West Virginia and east      to Ohio. It is a stout perennial growing up to six feet      tall with a creeping underground stem (rhizome) with fleshy      nodules. The leaves are pinnate with oval-toothed green      leaflets and prominent veins below. It produces tiny,      fragrant, cream-white-petaled flowers during summer.    </p>    <p>      Don't pay the drugstore for synthetic chemical remedies      when you can prepare a very effective extraction of the      flowers by boiling a cup of them in a small pan of water,      straining off the extract, and drinking it for flu      symptoms. Just another example of using nature's pharmacy      in exchange for high-priced flu remedies sold in stores.    </p>    <h3>      Goldenseal    </h3>    <p>      Sometimes when we suffer a cut it seems to happen at the      most inopportune time. While various commercial      preparations are available, the Cherokee Indians have long      valued the goldenseal plant for its ability to stop      bleeding and even hemorrhaging. Few wildflowers were as      important to the American Indians in general as the      versatile goldenseal, not only for its hemostatic      properties, but also as a dye and paint material.    </p>    <p>      Goldenseal belongs to the buttercup family and is also      known in different regions by other names such as eyeroot,      ground raspberry, Indian dye, yellow puccoon, and yellow      Indian paint. It is widespread in eastern United States,      although many of the natural sites have been exterminated      by commercial harvesting. It is a perennial herb with a      hairy stem 6-18 inches high. The blossoming stem bears two      alternate either five- or seven-lobed leaves. It displays a      greenish-white solitary flower in the spring which has no      petals and eventually develops into a mature red fruit that      looks like a small raspberry.    </p>    <p>      The next time you suffer a cut, have some ground      golden-seal ready to place on it. You can prepare it by      pulverizing the rhizome (underground stem) of a plant or      purchase it already in powder from a natural food store.    </p>    <h3>      Nerve-Calming Tea    </h3>    <p>      Valerian tea is rather neglected as a homemade remedy      because the roots smell so strong during preparation. The      flavor is also quite "singular," souse valerian in a      mixture with other pleasant-tasting herbs, as in the      following recipe:    </p>    <p>      8 parts valerian root<br />      6 parts hops<br />      3 parts peppermint leaves<br />      3 parts hibiscus flowers    </p>    <p>      It is best to soak these herbs overnight in lukewarm water,      heat up to drinking temperature in the morning, and then      strain them off. The results are excellent. One of the most      remarkable things about valerian is that it is calming, yet      does not inhibit concentration and awareness. Can the same      be said of any chemical tranquilizer?    </p>    <p>      Valerian seems to totally fascinate and hypnotize cats, so      store it carefully if there are felines about the house.    </p>    <h3>      Camphorated Oil    </h3>    <p>      We are always searching for relief from cold symptoms      including the inflamed sinuses and clogged nasal passages      that usually accompany a cold. Old-time drugstores used to      carry a compound called "camphorated oil" which, when      applied to inflamed or clogged areas, gave almost immediate      relief. It has long disappeared from the shelves and      several young pharmacists whom I talked to never heard of      it.    </p>    <p>      Camphorated oil is a combination of two medicinal herbs,      camphor and cottonseed oil. The camphor tree is native to      eastern Asia and grows as tall as 100 feet. It is also      cultivated in the warm subtropical regions of the United      States. The aromatic leaves are harvested and the oil is      extracted and distilled into colorless camphor crystals      which are shipped all over the world. Some pharmacies still      carry small amounts of camphor for compounding. Cottonseed      oil, sometimes also called sweet oil, may be found in      natural food stores and at times in hardware stores.    </p>    <p>      To make your own super-decongestant, place about half an      ounce of camphor crystals in a Pyrex glass with a matching      lid. Add a cup of cottonseed oil and gently warm until all      camphor crystals have dissolved in the oil. Do not heat      beyond this point. Then cover the container with a lid and      allow the mixture to cool. You have compounded a very old      prescription which is still very effective.    </p>    <h3>      Podophyllum and Benzoin    </h3>    <p>      Warts on the skin can be extremely irritating and there are      numerous commercial preparations which may work with      varying degrees of success, though they'll cost you. One of      the best preparations for wart removal is also a mixture of      two natural sources: podophyllum and benzoin.    </p>    <p>      Podophyllum powder is obtained from the May apple, a      perennial herb 6-18 inches high usually found in patches in      wooded areas of the eastern United States. May apple is      sometimes called mandrake, devil's apple, hog apple,      umbrella plant, and wild lemon. It may be obtained front      herbal outlets or natural food stores, if you are unable to      locate any near you in nature c . Benzoin comes from a      large tree grrowing in the Far East. It was brought to      Europe in 1498 by the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama,      who had obtained it from the peo ple in those regions.      Tincture of benzoin, which is an alcoholic solution, is a      yellow ish-brown fluid. Many drugstores carry it on their      shelves in two-ounce bottles.    </p>        <p>      To make an excellent wart remover, mix a teaspoon of      podophyllum which has been ground to powdered form in about      a quarter of an ounce of tincture of benzoin n and mix      thoroughly until the powder is dissolved. Apply to warts      and watch them disappear within a couple of days.    </p>    <p>      There are hundreds more natural remedies dies out there for      the growing and talking but it is very important to      remember that they are not a substitute for the advise and      care of your physician. Let them know what you are taking.      Make health care meeting of your two minds, not a personal      declaration of independence.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Dickson is a chemistry instructor m the nursing and      pre-pharmacy program Catawba Valley Community College in      Hickory, North Carolina.    </p>    <p>      BEATING THE BUM RAP<br />      HERBAL REMEDIES STILL SUFFER FROM THE NEGATIVE IMAGE      CREATED BY TRAVELING SNAKE-OIL SALESMEN.    </p>    <p>      __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________    </p>    <h3>      Cold and Flu Teas    </h3>    <p>      Colds and flu are heralded by such symptoms as runny nose,      aching throat, hoarseness, coughing, back pain, aching      muscles, and general fatigue. In children particularly,      these conditions may be accompanied by earache or high      fever. There are many herbs that can strengthen the body's      immune system, several of which are included in the      following .    </p>    <p>      ...for adults<br />      6 parts ephedra herb<br />      3 parts elder flowers<br />      3 parts rose hips<br />      2 parts willow bark<br />      2 parts linden flowers<br />      2 parts chamomile flowers<br />      2 parts hawthorn leaves with flowers    </p>    <p>      ...for children<br />      4 parts linden flowers<br />      4 parts mullein<br />      4 parts elder flowers<br />      4 parts rose hips<br />      4 parts thyme    </p>    <p>      This second tea has an antiinflammatory effect and promotes      sweating, which is one of the classical means by which you      can prevent a cold from taking hold. Children love the      taste of this tea, especially when it is sweetened by a      little honey.    </p>    <p>      When you have just come down with bronchitis, you should      use anti-inflammatory herbs that discourage bacterial      growth as well as coat and protect inflamed mucous      membranes. A good cough tea mixture with this objective is      the following.    </p>    <p>      8 parts plantain leaves<br />      8 parts coltsfoot flowers<br />      2 parts marshmallow root<br />      2 parts mallow    </p>    <p>      The herbal teas listed in both parts of our herbal special      feature section have been adapted from The Family Herbal      (Healing Arts Press, 1994, an imprint of Inner Traditions      International) by Barbara anti Peter Theiss.    </p>    <h3>      Other Woodland Remedies of Note    </h3>    <p>      0n the banks of streams, and now cultivated in yards, is      the <strong>witch hazel</strong> bush. It is of particular      interest because of the appearance of yellow flowers which      do not appear until October and November and remain until      temperatures become quite cold. Botanists call this bush      hamemelis, and its leaves and bark, long used by Indian      tribes, are distilled with diluted alcohol to produce the      popular astringent sold in drugstores and also used in      cosmetics called hamemelis water, or just simply witch      hazel.    </p>    <p>      While not being a native North American plant, the      <strong>aloe</strong> , with some 170 different species,      has become widely cultivated here and thereby a part of      both the garden and the woodlands scene. The dried juice of      the leaves was known to the ancients as far back as the      time of Alexander the Great. It continues to be used in      pharmacy today in two ways: first, as an ingredient in drug      mixtures designed to induce bowel movements and secondly,      as a healing agent used in various ointments applied to      burns and cuts.    </p>    <p>      A flowering plant native to Europe, but now found in      American woods, and particularly grandma's flower garden,      is the popular <strong>purple foxglove</strong> , known      botanically as Digitalis purpurea. From the dried flowers      of this plant have been isolated some powerful heart      medications often marketed under the general name of      Digoxin. The history of digitalis goes back to the tenth      century when the British physicians were using it to treat      cardiac irregularities. It remains a widely used drug to      this day.    </p>    <p>      One of the most common trees we encounter in our walk      through the forest is the elm, which grows over a wide      range of territory. The specific tree of pharmaceutical      value is the <strong>slippery elm</strong> , or Ulmus      fulva. For centuries American Indians used the bark for      preserving fatty substances from becoming rancid by      melting, for example, bear's fat with the bark and then      straining off the fat. The other use, however, is the one      that has continued to this day. A warm infusion of the bark      was discovered to relieve throat irritations. It is now      used either alone or as an ingredient of throat lozenges      which can be purchased over the counter in drug and grocery      stores.    </p>    <p>      Our next stop in our journey through the wild forest brings      us to the <strong>jimson</strong> or Jamestown weed, which      grows wild throughout the United States. The thornapple      species of the annual plant is called the Datura      strammonium, and from its dried leaves and flowering tops      is obtained the drug strammonium. It was first brought to      England from the East Indies where natives there were      smoking it for the relief of asthma symptoms. The fluid      extract of strammonium continues to be used in medicine as      a bronchial dilator for the relief of breathing problems      associated with asthma.    </p>    <p>      The final stop on this journey through the forest brings us      to the <strong>willow</strong> tree. This tree is one of      the original sources for what has become the most widely      used drug in the world-the aspirin tablet. For centuries      medicine men of native tribes recommended chewing the bark      of the Spirea ulmaria as an antidote for pain and fevers.      But it wasn't until the 19th century that a German chemist      discovered that its main ingredient, salicylic acid, was      indeed both an antipyretic (fever reducer) and an analgesic      (pain reliever). As a result of all this the compound      acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA to your nurse, or just plain      aspirin, has found its way to the shelves or virtually      every home medicine chest in America.    </p>
