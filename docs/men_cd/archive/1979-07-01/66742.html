                    <h5 id="byline">      by JIMMY LANGLEY    </h5>		<hr />        <p>      Some folks have a knack for just tackling a problem by the      seat of their pants and coming up with an answer, and Jim      Langley of Heflin, Alabama seems to be one of those people.      Jim picked up a copy of the January/February 1979 issue of      MOTHER (which featured a Plowboy Interview with Lance      Crombie, the by-now-famous Minnesota farmer who was      producing his own home fuel), and the explanation of      Lance's simple solar still really sparked the Alabamian's      interest.    </p>    <p>      So, without any further ado, Langley sat himself down and      built his own version of a solar distillation apparatus,      using Lance's description-and a little common sense-as a      guide. "The idea came right out of y'all's magazine. Just      from reading what Crombie had to say-and adding a few      details from your solar collector articles-I put together      my still. Of course I just guessed at some of the      dimensions ... but I must've done something right, 'cause      I'm getting fuel strength alcohol on the first run!"    </p>    <h3>      IT'S SIMPLE AS PIE    </h3>    <p>      Basically, Jim's still is a 4' X 8-1/2' tray-5 1/4"      deep-that's backed with a full sheet of 3/4" plywood and      faced with a piece of plexiglass. Inside this bin-at its      midpoint-is a 1" X 4" board ... fastened horizontally to      the sides and rear of the box. (This method of construction      provides for a gap of an inch or so between the glazing and      the horizontal shelf.)    </p>    <p>      The plywood covering at the rear of the tray has an 8" X 8"      access door cut into it, positioned just above the ledge      and designed so it can be tightly sealed. The plexiglass      sheet itself is also rendered completely airtight with      silicone sealant, and it's fastened to the box so that the      transparent material's lower edge rests inside a 12" X 48"      board mounted at the foot of the tray. (This plank serves      as part of the alcohol collection bin at the base of the      upright still.) A spigot is then installed at the tray's      lowest point and used to drain off the distilled product at      regular intervals.    </p>    <h3>      HOW IT WORKS    </h3>    <p>      First, Jim built a frame to support the still in a      partially upright position . . . he feels that an angle of      between 57° and 62° is best in his part of the      Cotton State, but he suggests that anyone duplicating his      efforts elsewhere recalculate this angle by merely adding      25° to their own latitude.    </p>    <p>      After positioning the still at the correct angle and facing      it toward the sun, the Alabamian opens the door at the rear      of the box and places five two-liter, plastic soft-drink      containers-filled with his mash solution-on the horizontal      shelf within the still (he's cut, the top three inches or      so off the neck of each bottle to provide a wider opening).    </p>    <p>      Then Jim just goes about his daily routine and lets Ol' Sol      shine on. The theory is that-since alcohol is driven out of      the mixture at a lower temperature than is water-the fuel      rises in a vapor, condenses on the inside surface of the      upper portion of plexiglass facing, and runs down into the      basin at the bottom of the still . . . to be tapped off      later.    </p>    <h3>      AND HE PUTS IT TO USE    </h3>    <p>      Apparently, J.L.'s distillery has produced alcohol pure      enough to run a variety of internal combustion engines. Jim      says he's operated his motorcycle on a gasoline/alcohol      mixture, but uses pure ethanol fuel in his lawn mower. "I      run a mix of six gallons of alcohol to four gallons of      gasoline in my bike, but I've got to add oil to the fuel      since the cycle has a two-stroke engine. On my lawn      mower-which operates just fine on straight alky-I simply      drilled the main metering jet out another .002", adjusted      the air screw on the carburetor, and yanked the starter      cord . . . it purred like a kitten!"    </p>    <p>      Jim admits that he hasn't made a large quantity of      "farmer's fuel" in the several months he's been      experimenting, but only because alcohol research is just a      hobby for him. "I make a few gallons when I can ... since I      enjoy puttering around with gasoline engines. If I had a      lot of alcohol, I might even consider running my car on      pure brew . . . but right now, I'm playing around just for      fun."    </p>    <p>      What's Important, though, is that although Jim might be      "just foolin' around" he is helping to demonstrate that we      don't have to depend upon imported, nonrenewable sources to      meet our liquid fuel needs.    </p>    <p>      Of course, Langley's design may well be too crude-and too      dependent upon uninterrupted sunshine-to be considered a      reliable source of backyard power. (it was such problems      that led MOTHER's researchers to develop a more efficient      and productive type of still.) But-with the need for a      gasoline substitute growing more and more desperate by the      day-those of us who are experimenting with home-produced      ethanol can't afford to discount any ideas that might help      make agriculturally produced fuel more available.    </p>    <h3>      COOKING UP MOTHER'S MASH    </h3>    <p>      All successful ethanol production begins with a starch-rich      concoction which converts, easily and thoroughly, to a      yeast culture's favorite food: fermentable sugars. And-when      the fungi find a generous supply of their preferred      fare-they reward the distiller with a high rate of alcohol      yield. MOTHER included several of these mashing recipes in      Issue No. 57 . .. all of them adapted from beverage "alky"      formulas. Since then, our researchers have been busy      mashing, fermenting, and distilling. Their recent      experience-combined with some expert advice on fuel-grade      alcohol preparation-has resulted in the following technique      ... one which returns a maximum volume of flame-grade      juice.    </p>    <p>      Start with a bushel (56 pounds) of well-milled corn and 30      gallons of water adjusted to a pH factor of 7. (Measure the      pH with litmus paper and adjust the factor by adding      agricultural lime to raise the number or citric acid to      reduce the figure.) Slowly add the water to the corneal ...      stirring constantly to prevent lumping. Then-once the      solution is well mixed-add two ounces of Taka-Therm enzyme      (available from MOTHER) and heat the mash slowly (with      continuous agitation) from room temperature to about      160°F in one hour, (Taka-Therm helps keep the starches      from gelling, but-if you heat the mash too quickly-the      enzyme won't get a chance to work. If you do make this      error, stop agitating and let the goo cool until it      reliquefies.) Continue to heat the concoction to boiling      point . . . then shut off the heat. Stir the mixture      occasionally while it cools.    </p>    <p>      Once the temperature drops to about 140°F, check the pH      factor again and adjust to 4 (adding citric acid if      necessary). Then put in two ounces of Diazyme (a second      enzyme, also available from MOTHER), which helps break down      the starch chain molecules and speeds the conversion to      fermentable sugars. Now let your mash cool overnight. By      the following morning the temperature should be in the      70-80°F range ... which is the correct environment for      yeast feeding.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER's research staffers have gotten the best results      with two ounces of moist, caked baker's yeast. Within a few      hours of adding the yeast, you should begin to see the      hungry plants doing their job. When the "brew" starts      bubbling, cover the barrel (you can use a fermentation lock      for this stage) and just let it rest quietly while the      yeast "chows down".    </p>    <p>      Fermentation should be completed in four to six days. You      can tell that your mash is "ripe" when active bubbling      stops and the cap of "corny" material sinks. Once the yeast      is spent, you must put the mash to use right away . . .      before fermentation heads on to the next (undesirable)      stage.    </p>    <p>      Finally, separate the solid material from the liquid mash      mixture by first skimming the fluid from the top and then      squeezing the solids inside a burlap bag . . . over a      milking funnel and a pail. Be sure to set the leftover      grains out to dry promptly, or they will turn bad. These      "distiller's dried grains and solubles" (DDGS) will become      a key part of the economics of home alcohol production. The      cornmeal by-product is nearly 30% protein and makes      excellent livestock feed.    </p>
