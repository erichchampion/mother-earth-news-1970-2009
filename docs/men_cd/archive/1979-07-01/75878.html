                        <p>      <em>For the past several years, the good folks at the      Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Washington, D.C. have      worked to help urban residents gain greater control over      their lives through the use of low-technology, decentralist      tools and concepts. We strongly believe that more people      (city dwellers and country folk alike) should be exposed to      the Institute's efforts ... which is why we're now making      this "what's happening where" report by ILSR staffers one      of MOTHER's regular features.</em>    </p>    <p>      We often hear of homesteaders who install solar systems or      wood stoves to make themselves energy self-sufficient. But      one of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's studies has      shown that city dwellers can-like their country cousins-go      along way toward achieving such a goal for themselves!    </p>    <h3>      A BIG-CITY CONCERN    </h3>    <p>      The cost of energy has rapidly become a major item in all      urban budgets. Using Washington, D.C. as a case study, the      Institute found that the city spent $601 million on energy      in 1977. In fact, the District government used more money      to purchase "power" than it budgeted for its entire court      system! Worse than that, 86 cents out of every one of those      energy dollars left the local economy, never to return . .      . and only 3 cents of the remaining 144 went directly into      the pockets of District residents in the form of wages and      salaries. (This kind of "trade deficit" can rapidly drain      the treasury of even the wealthiest community!)    </p>    <p>      A reduction in the amount of such "exported" money could      have multiple benefits for a metropolis . . . because      energy conservation efforts and solar installations produce      far more jobs-dollar for dollar-than do investments in      nuclear power plants and oil refineries. On top of that,      the jobs created by "alternative" programs provide      opportunities for both skilled and semiskilled workers. (In      Washington-where half of the city's teenage blacks are      unemployed-such labor opportunities could be really      valuable!)    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the biggest benefit of urban energy      self-sufficiency, however, is that investments in power      conservation or solar technology tend to create and nurture      small, locally based businesses. In Washington, for      example, the "energy efficiency industries"such as      insulation firms-could provide a 45% cut in present "power"      use (excluding transportaion) while occupying several times      the city's current energy-related work force. And those      dollars that formerly left the city could be spent within      the District ... to the benefit of its citizens.    </p>    <p>      Such a route is not just an idealistic dream, either . . .      because-after reviewing information on energy consumption      in the nation's capital-the Institute estimates that the      city could (without affecting lifestyles or standards of      living) reduce its present "power diet" by 50%. (The      complete report is available from the Institute for $13.)    </p>    <h3>      CLEAN, SOLAR CITIES    </h3>    <p>      Energy self-reliance, however, means a city must generate      its own power supply as well as reduce its consumption of      "imported" energy. Naturally, the potential for solar      technology in any given city depends upon the ratio of      available collector space to living space.    </p>    <p>      Although Washington has one of the highest densities of      population in the nation, it's also blessed with an      abundance of flat rooftops and a height limitation on      buildings. Considering the present state of the art in      solar technology, the Institute estimates that-while higher      buildings would require more collector space than is      available on their own roofs-three-story structures could      produce all their thermal and electrical needs through the      use of, solar installations.    </p>    <p>      Economics, of course, will play a major role in such      development. So it's very important to understand the      different measures by which systems can be judged      "cost-effective".    </p>    <p>      For example, if a single homeowner saves only 60d in fuel      for every $1.00 spent on solar equipment over the lifetime      of the system, the "sun power" wouldn't make much sense.      But when the same situation is applied to an entire city,      the figures can be viewed very differently, especially if      you assume (as in the case of Washington) that only      14 cents of every conventional-energy dollar is retained in      the local economy . . . whereas 50 cents of every "solar"      dollar would return to the city in the form of payments to      local industries, workers, and taxes. The multiplying      effect of such "recycled" money can make solar power      extremely economical from an urban (and social)      perspective.    </p>    <p>      The challenge, then, exists in the manner in which cities      can use their financing, taxing, and planning authorities      to blend individual self-interest and community interests.      One also has to keep in mind the intangible-but very      important-benefits of local energy systems:      self-confidence, self-reliance, a clean environment, and a      quiet city.    </p>    <p>      Ironically, talk about energy self-sufficiency in the      nation's capital has just begun. It is to be hoped      that-through discussion, education, and experimentation-we      can look back on the energy crisis of the 1970's as the      catalyst for the development of better, more      self-sufficient communities and cities across the entire      nation.    </p>    <p>      You can have a free catalog of ILSR's recently expanded and      updated selection of books and pamphlets by sending the      Institute a self-addressed, stamped envelope, To get on the      mailing list for their bimonthly magazine, Self-Reliance,      send $8.00 (or $15.00 for institutions) to ILSR, 1717 18th      Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009. Or, send $25 ($17 of      which is tax-deductible) to become an associate member of      the Institute . . . and-in addition to receiving their      magazine-you'll obtain a 20% discount on other Local      Self-Reliance publications.-MOTHER.    </p>
