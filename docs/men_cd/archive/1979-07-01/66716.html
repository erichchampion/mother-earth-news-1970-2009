                <p>      When snails invade your crops, get ready for some good      eating!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by <em>ELEN E SAMPSON</em>    </h5>        <p>      Snails are one group of pests that most folks would like to      evict from their gardens forever. For us MOTHER types who      aren't fond of chemical baits, about the easiest way to      reduce the population of these leaf munchers is to pick 'em      off the plants by hand. But what do you do with the      creatures after you've collected a batch? Why, you cook 'em      up, of course!    </p>    <h3>      A LITTLE BACKGROUND    </h3>    <p>      Now before you get queasy . . . remember that snails belong      to the phylum Mollusca which includes oysters, clams, and      other familiar shellfish-and can be used in gumbos or any      other recipes calling for such "ordinary" edibles. For      centuries <em>escargots</em> , as the French know them,      have been a popular European dish . ... their consumption      actually dates back to the Stone Age!<br />      <br />      Snails are believed to have been brought to America during      the nineteenth century and cultivated here as a food      source. Some of the gregarious immigrants escaped . . .      liked the climate ... and multiplied rapidly. Their      descendants-which still menace our gardens today-are rich      in protein and minerals and low in calories ( about 90      units per 100 grams of meat).<br />      <br />      According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, several      types of common land snails found in this country are known      to be edible. Here are the descriptions of just a few      varieties:<br />      <br />      Burgundy or Roman Snail ( <em>Helix pomatia</em> ) : Its      light tan shell has a rather wide, uninterrupted spiral      brown band.<br />      <br />      Petit-Gris, Brown Garden, European Brown, or European      Spotted Snail ( <em>Helix aspersa</em> ): This one's yellow      or off-white shell is large, rather thin, and has brown      spiral bands with yellow flecks or streaks.<br />      <br />      Milk or Spanish Snail ( <em>Otala lactea</em> ): Its      flattened, white shell has reddish-brown bands.<br />      <br />      Wood Snail ( <em>Cepaea nemoralis</em> ): The shell might      be yellow, olive, or red, but it usually has one to five      reddishbrown bands.<br />      <br />      If you'd like to know which toothsome mollusks are found in      your area, you can order a free booklet- <em>Edible Snails      of the United States</em> -from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife      Service, 18th and C Streets N. W. , Washington, D.C. 20420.    </p>    <h3>		THE HARVEST MOON    </h3>    <p>      As you probably already know, snails are nocturnal and      prefer to feed on tender flowers and vegetable plants      during the first half of the night. By day, the little      critters hide in cool, dark, moist places. If the weather      becomes too hot or cold, they'll hibernate until conditions      are favorable.<br />      <br />      According to connoisseurs, <em>escargots</em> taste best in      the fall, but they <em>can</em> be eaten any time of the      year. It's wise, however, to catch only mature specimens .      . . with shells of at least one inch in diameter. Immature      snails don't yield much meat, and their "houses" will break      easily when handled. (Be sure, too, that those you collect      are alive: The healthy specimens will withdraw into their      shells when touched.)<br />      <br />      One simple way to gather the little beasts is to thoroughly      water an infested area at dusk. The dampness will bring the      snails out of hiding, and after waiting an hour or soyou      can use a lantern or flashlight to spot your harvest. It's      also possible to trap snails by laying boards, stones,      lettuce leaves, or citrus fruit rinds on the ground (place      'em near plants for best results). Then, all you have to do      is gather up the snails that will be hidden underneath your      "snares" early the next morning. (If any pesticides have      been used on your lawn or garden, though . . . the area      should be watered down thoroughly, and the mollusk harvest      postponed for <em>at least</em> six weeks.)<br />      <br />      Once you've collected a supply of snails, they must be      purged of any toxic materials-and blanched before being      prepared for the table. These processes are relatively      simple, but essential. And if you'd prefer your      <em>escargots</em> super-tender (rather than just a mite      chewy), you may want to simmer the meat awhile, too, before      embarking on a recipe. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: See the sidebar      that accompanies this article for pre-preparation      details.]</em>    </p>    <h3>      "SHELL" WE DINE?    </h3>    <p>      When the pests-turned- have been cleansed, fattened, and      blanched ... pull them from their shells-with a toothpick,      ice pick, nut pick, or small knife-and discard the small,      dark, fleshy coil (it's found at the end of the snail's      body) that connects each animal to its shell. (The dark      area is the gallbladder, and it's bitter.) You may also      want to cut off any horny operculum at the tip of each      snail's head. Now, rinse the meat again under cold      water.<br />      <br />      This is a good time to prepare a number of the prettier      shells for future use. To clean the natural "serving      dishes", boil 'em for 30 minutes with 1/4 teaspoon of      baking soda to each pint of water. Then drain the shells      and rinse them thoroughly.<br />      <br />      Most all European cookbooks have elaborate recipes for      snails, but here are a few <em>simple</em> (yet delicious!)      "food formulas" from the University of California's      Cooperative Extension.<br />      <br />      <strong>STUFFED SNAIL SHELLS</strong> Simmer the cleaned      and blanched snail meat in salted water until tender. Then      chop up the tiny "steaks" and mix 'em with minced garlic.      Sauté in olive oil or margarine for about five      minutes. Stuff the cooked meat into a shell, seal the      opening with garlic butter, place under a broiler until the      butter bubbles, and serve the dish immediately.<br />      <br />      (To make garlic butter . . . cream 1/2 cup of butter or      margarine, 3 tablespoons of finely chopped parsley, 2      teaspoons of minced green onions and tops, 1 clove of      crushed garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of      pepper until all the ingredients are thoroughly      blended.)<br />      <br />      <strong>FRIED SNAILS</strong> Place your prepared snail      meat in water (to cover) seasoned with salt, bay leaf,      garlic, and parsley . . . and let the pot simmer for 10      minutes. Roll the cooked meat in fine cracker or bread      crumbs- seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder-and      then fry the <em>escargots</em> in hot oil until they're      browned. Sprinkle the succulent morsels with lemon juice      just before serving as an entree or as hors d'oeuvres.    </p>    <h3>      SNAILS IN WINE SAUCE    </h3>    <p>      To make three servings, combine-inside an ovenproof dish-18      cleaned and blanched snails, 2 slices of diced bacon, 9      tiny whole onions (or 1/2 cup of chopped onion), 1 clove of      crushed garlic, 1 tablespoon of minced parsley, 1 cup of      red wine or grape juice, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, and a      pinch of thyme.<br />      <br />      Cover your container and bake for one hour at 275°F.      Just before you dish up the delicacy, thicken it with a      butter and flour mixture . . . and serve it over toast or      croutons.      </p>			<h3>      SNAILS IN TOMATO SAUCE</h3>		<p>	      First, sauté 1 chopped medium-sized onion, 2 cloves      of crushed garlic, and 1/2 cup of diced bell pepper in oil.      Add a 1-pound can of tomatoes ( and salt and pepper to      taste), then simmer until the bell pepper is tender and the      flavors are blended. Add 1 pint of cleaned and blanched      snails and simmer the mixture for 10 minutes. When this      combination is spooned over toast, rice, or noodles, the      dish will provide from four to six mouthwatering servings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Here's more about every gourmet's favorite      gastropods</strong> <strong>... from Roland and Claire      Eves.</strong>    </p>    <h3>      SNAIL SCAVENGERS IN THE      SUBURBS    </h3>    <p>      Garden snails are superb as a "special" dinner treat or      food staple. Our supermarket sells a tin of 24 of the      delicacies for $4.00, and most French restaurants will      serve up a dozen for an even higher price. In our suburban      neighborhood, however, one person can gather 100 to 200 "      <em>escargots</em> on the hoof" in about 20 minutes on      almost any night following a rain . .. and the pickin's are      free!    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOOD'N' HEALTHFUL</strong>    </p>    <p>      Besides being delicious, snails are very nutritious . ..      the critters are good sources of both protein and glycogen      (a storage form of glucose). Better yet-since they're      hermaphroditic-any two of the shelled animals can produce      prolifically. They're definitely <em>not</em> an endangered      species (as are some sources of wild food), so you needn't      fear that your appetite for the marvelous mollusks will      exterminate the local population.    </p>    <p>      Many cultures have held snails in high esteem. Ancient      Romans were so addicted to the "creep-alongs" that they had      farms where snails were fed on special diets of flour and      spices. Orientals and many African peoples have also long      regarded them as a staple, and-of course-the French have      made a fetish of <em>escargots</em> .    </p>    <p>      We've only had personal eatin' experience with the common      garden snail of southern California . . , which is of the      same genus if not the same species-as the French variety.      We suspect, however, that-for cooking purposes-most land      snails are pretty much the same (of course, you should      check your local snails against a good field guide-or the      U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service booklet mentioned      above-before you eat them) . . . provided you follow an      uncomplicated, but lengthy and <em>necessary</em> ,      preparation procedure.    </p>    <p>      You must allow a week or more for the elimination of toxic      substances from the snails' systems (chemicals ingested      from plants which the crawlers can eat but you can't, along      with any "snail bait" they may have encountered on their      way to your garden). Of course, any area with a large snail      population probably belongs to a nonpoisoning owner . . .      but play it safe by keeping your catch for a week or two to      cleanse migrants from less "kosher" yards. (Snails travel      farther-and in less time than you might think!)    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM GARDEN TO GARLIC SAUCE</strong>    </p>    <p>      We put our captured creatures in a large, clean container.      (Figure between 12 and 18 snails in one two-pound coffee      can.) Then we cover the vessel with a ventilated lid and      place it in a cool, shady spot. Be sure the top is secure      enough to prevent your charges from escaping, because these      mighty mollusks can lift five times their weight while      traveling up a vertical surface, and-on the horizontal-can      pull objects 200 times heavier than themselves!    </p>    <p>      The next step is to starve your future delicacies for 48 to      72 hours. (They won't die, but will simply expel their      waste products and go into hibernation. You can tell when      this "sleeping state" is reached, because the snails will      close the apertures of their shells with a hard, buttonlike      secretion-the operculum-which can be removed before      cooking.) After the fast, place the critters in oatmeal or      cornmeal for 10 days to two weeks . . . to fatten them up      and further clean out their digestive tracts. Your small      "livestock" may be kept for a long time if their food is      changed every other day to keep it from molding or souring.    </p>    <p>      When the crop is ready to be cooked, discard any specimens      chat don't respond when touched, scrub the shells with a      vegetable brush, and drop the snails into boiling water      with a few teaspoons of salt and vinegar (and possibly a      bay leaf) added. Let 'em simmer for 10 minutes, then rinse      each individual thoroughly to remove the "slime". Folks who      express disgust at the notion of eating a snail almost      invariably explain that "snails are slimy" . . . and      they're correct. The shiny film is a secretion which      protects the external membranes of these former sea      creatures. And, while it's not a "filthy" excrement in any      respect, it does create a peculiar sensation in the mouth      if it's not completely removed.)    </p>    <p>      When you've rinsed to your satisfaction (you'll be able to      tell when the slipperiness has washed away) . . . remove      each snail from its shell, cut off the dark-colored gall      (about 1/4 inch long) on its tail, and simmer the meat for      about two hours for maximum tenderness. (Remember that      simmering means cooking food at very <em>low</em> heat. All      protein becomes tough at high temperatures, as a few      experiments with hard-boiled eggs will demonstrate.)    </p>    <p>      At this point, your <em>escargots</em> can be frozen or      used immediately in a variety of ways. We prefer a sauce of      olive oil, wine, garlic, basil, tarragon, and a dash of      nutmeg. Stir an equal volume of mushrooms and snails into      this mixture, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes . . . or      stuff a few mushrooms with "mollusk meat" and broil these      for a few minutes. Either way, you'll produce a dish so      delectable that one feels almost decadent eating it.    </p>    <p>      It's nice to know that we can cook up a delicious snail      dinner any time we want one-by simply gathering the raw      materials along our street . . . and, apparently, we're not      alone in our enthusiasm.    </p>    <p>      At 2:00 a.m. one recent night, Roland-armed with a bucket      and flashlight-was stopped by the local police. The men in      blue cheerfully asked him, "Are you collecting snails?"      When Roland admitted that he was, they drove on.    </p>    <p>      What more could one ask as evidence of the awakening      consciousness of alternative lifestyles?    </p>
