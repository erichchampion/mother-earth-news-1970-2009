        CLOCKWISE FROM ABOVE: The best way to learn to recognize top-quality animals (the only kind you should buy for your own farm or homestead) is to study the prize-winning contestants at livestock shows .... If you know your barnyard beasts, one glance at this photo will show you that this entire flock of sheep has been stricken with abscesses! The ailing woolmakers all walk with their heads down! . . . This open-ended goat shelter gives the animals plenty of protection from rain and wind (the livestock house faces away from the prevailing breezes) while providing enough ventilation to keep the quarters well-aired and healthful! . . . Fences keep your critters in-and unwanted animals out-but it takes sturdy construction and yearly upkeep to make sure those livestock barricades stay intact .... A good animal steward takes care of his or her livestock's needs and makes sure the critters receive adequate love and attention.
