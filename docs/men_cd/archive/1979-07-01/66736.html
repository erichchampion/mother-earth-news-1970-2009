    <p>
                    <p>      <em>Veterinarian <strong>Randy Kidd</strong> reminds us      that the best "cure" for livestock (and pet!) diseases is a      sound prevention program. <strong><br /></strong></em>    </p>            <p>      If you live-or plan to live-in the country, you probably      intend to raise some food- or fiber-yielding animals. Now      some homesteaders are content with a few egg-laying      chickens and a dairy goat . . . while others hope to start      a full-fledged livestock operation. But whether your goal      is a few gallons of buttermilk or a whole herd of beefalo,      you'll have to be absolutely dedicated to keeping your      critters healthy.    </p>    <p>      There is, of course, a practical monetary reason for such a      conscientious disease-prevention effort: Animals that are      in less than peak condition simply don't produce their      maximum in meat, wool, eggs, or milk. And unless you're a      lot richer than I am, you plain can't afford to be      constantly funneling feed into such "uneconomical"      critters.    </p>    <p>      In addition, there's an ethical reason for doing your best      to keep your animals perfectly hale and hearty. Every      livestock or pet owner is a guardian of his or her beasts      and fowl, and therefore is morally responsible for giving      the animals the very best of care during their lifetimes.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, safeguarding the health of your livestock is      by no means an impossible or even an overly time-consuming      task. On the contrary, if you take the time to learn-and      consistently follow-a few basic guidelines for animal      husbandry, your critters will thrive like shoots in      springtime. These "rules of the animal health road" (which      are guaranteed to help keep any cow, cur, goat, or guinea      absolutely fit) are called: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS FOR      HEALTHY LIVESTOCK.    </p>    <h3>      KEEPING THE RIGHT ANIMALS    </h3>    <p>      I. Recognize your market. Before you begin to "stock up" on      farm animals, take a good hard look at who will be eating      or using their meat or produce. A realistic appraisal will      show that-at least in the beginning-the main market for      such products will be your own family. It's often difficult      to try to turn your critters into moneymakers . . . because      the minute you put up a FOR SALE sign, you're competing      with all the food conglomerates and "plastic" food      producers. And-although you know that homegrown "vittles"      are tastier and more wholesome than the mass-raised,      chemical-injected variety-quality eats are also more      expensive, in most cases, than are store-bought foods.      Unfortunately, as we all know, the average food buyer      is-shortsightedly-more cost- than health-conscious.    </p>    <p>      So don't raise a critter unless you want its products! If      your family treats goat milk like some foul-tasting      medicine, don't own half a dozen nannies that each give a      gallon of milk a day . . . and devour your grain supplies.      If you can't see yourself ever butchering any cute-looking      rabbits, don't keep a hutch full of the rapidly multiplying      mammals.    </p>    <p>      What does all this advice have to do with animal health?      Simply this: Most any critter needs a little love and      affection in order to thrive and produce well. If you don't      really want the foodstuff you're working-and paying-to      raise, you may well become tremendously unhappy with (and      therefore less careful of) your livestock. I've seen folks      who almost hate to wake up in the morning . . . because      they know they'll find that their attention-demanding      homestead animals are still around. So do yourself-and the      beasts and birds- a favor. Don't raise what you won't use.    </p>    <p>      II. Know what a normal animal looks and feels like . Once      you've decided what kind of livestock you'd like to raise,      you'll need to be sure you're able to readily recognize      healthy specimens of those breeds. Of course, no one can      spot an able-bodied critter just by looking over a fence at      it. No sir, your hands will have to know how a normal      animal feels just as your eyes will need to recognize how a      healthy one looks.    </p>    <p>      Let's take an example: Suppose you're shopping for a nanny      goat, and the particular creature you're examining has rump      bones that poke out against her fur . . . a very wide chest      with a "barrel" belly . . . and a strikingly large, broad      udder that's equipped with hand-sized teats. If you don't      know goats, this beast may sound a bit like a malformed      monster. But such features exemplify "dairy character".    </p>    <p>      The knowledgeable "shopper", on the other hand, will look      even further and perhaps notice-for example-that the      critter's coat is awfully rough for the middle of summer (a      sign that it may be undernourished or sick with parasites).      He or she will also be sure to bend down beside the goat      and rub its skin-firmly but gently-all over: If there      aren't any unusual lumps, ol' Nan probably doesn't have      abscesses. But if the animal fidgets during such a      "checkup", the goat-wise buyer will suspect she's hard to      milk. Of course, an "in the know" farmer would never buy a      goat that he or she hasn't personally milked . . . and      would likely discover that our "sample" nanny reacts to the      procedure by kicking and jerking unmanageably.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, you should know all such "clues" by heart, and      be able to reject the described goat on the spot-without      even investigating such further points as her stool, teeth,      or suspicious cough-and look somewhere else for your      homestead milk animal. And goats aren't the only critters      that need a complete "physical". Every type of animal      should be examined just as thoroughly . . . and each      species has its own peculiarities. Pigs, for example, have      such an unusual gait that - unless you understand their      normal way of walking-you might not recognize when one is      lame . . . while rabbits and sheep that look loaded with      muscle may turn out-upon prodding-merely to be heavily      furred or wooled. So don't go livestock shopping until      you've seen (and felt) enough critters to know what's      normal and what's not. (This knowledge will also come in      handy while you're raising the animals . . . because if you      don't recognize a healthy bird or beast, you sure as heck      won't spot a sick one! )    </p>    <p>      III. Buy the best animals. If you expect top production      from your livestock (and you shouldn't aim for any less),      you must buy the best animals available. Please note that      I'm not saying "the best you can afford" . . . because the      worst livestock decision you can make is to purchase a poor      quality critter. Such a financial "deal" will end up-in the      long run-costing you a lot of money. If you can't afford      superior animals, don't purchase any beasts at all.    </p>    <p>      Because you should only "buy the best", the ability to      distinguish between high-quality and "average" critters is      as important a skill as is recognizing normal-as opposed to      inferior-specimens. And the quickest way to learn "advanced      animal appreciation" is to spend a few days studying the      prize entries at the county fair. Be sure to watch the      livestock judging . . . and listen closely when the      officials give their reasons for selecting one beast over      another. Before long, you'll understand the standards of      excellence for each species and pick the same top ribbon      winners that the experienced judges choose.    </p>    <p>      Once you do know what to look for in your herd and flock      "starters" and begin shopping around, promise yourself that      you won't buy any animals until you've seen at least a half      dozen of the finest specimens in your area . . . and then      purchase the very best of the bunch for your homestead.      Don't be like the goat shoppers who pull up to my      place-with a pickup truck full of children-so eager to get      themselves a nanny (or maybe even two or three if the      young'uns whine enough) that they'll buy an animal      regardless of the critter's quality. Do your looking . . .      and then do your buying.    </p>    <p>      IV. Cull the worst animals. If one side of the      livestock-choosing coin is to purchase the best specimens,      the other side -inevitably-is to remove the worst from your      pens and pastures. The chicken that won't lay eggs, the      rabbit that bears four or five bunnies per litter instead      of six to eight, the goat that dries up after four months      of lactation (and doesn't get bred every year)-in fact, any      animals that aren't superior examples of their breed-should      be culled. In most cases, the easiest way to get rid of      unwanted critters is simply to add them to your dinner      menus.    </p>    <p>      Culling improves the quality of your present-and      future-stock, helps weed out inherited tendencies toward      disease, and makes it possible for you to keep your feed      bill at a reasonable level. Some folks consider this      "survival of the fittest" idea harsh . . . but it's the      ultimate test of whether you are in the livestock-or the      pet-raising business. Of course, there's nothing wrong with      keeping animals as companions . . . but that sort of      operation isn't always compatible with maintaining      productive farm stock.    </p>    <h3>      KNOWING YOUR ANIMALS    </h3>    <p>      V. Be aware of your animals' cycles. Every beast or bird is      controlled by its own natural life patterns. And-as a      livestock producer-you need to understand these predictable      cycles.    </p>    <p>      For instance, you'll have to know when your female critter      will come into heat, how long that breeding period will      last, and when-during the cycle-the animal should be bred.    </p>    <p>      Some other "facts of life" that a successful stockowner      will learn are these: How long-after breeding-will the      young'uns be born? (You need to be prepared for those      babies!) And at what age should the little ones be weaned?      When will the maturing critters begin to produce milk,      eggs, wool, or meat? How much "harvest" can be expected . .      . and how long will the animal in question continue to      produce?    </p>    <p>      You see, all of these considerations can be related to      natural cycles. You need to be familiar with the life      patterns for every type of animal you raise in order to      know what to expect . . . and when to expect it.    </p>    <p>      VI. Keep meaningful records. Livestock cycles will tell you      how your animals are supposed to grow and produce. But you      still won't know which critters really are meeting those      expectations (and consequently which uneconomical beasts to      cull) . . . unless you keep accurate records.    </p>    <p>      For meat-producing stock, you'll have to tally dates and      weights at birth, weaning, and butchering. Breeding records      should include sires, expected and actual birth dates, and      litter size and weights. And, of course, you'll need to      keep tabs on all of your animals' milk, wool, or egg      yields. (Remember that some critters' productivity can only      be assessed by group output . . . it's often pretty      difficult to tell just which chicken laid what egg!) You      can then compare these totals against your feed bills-and      other expenses-and know whether or not your livestock      enterprise is profitable.    </p>    <p>      Not only should you keep records on your own animals . . .      you should also only buy critters with accurate production      sheets. When a farmer comes out with that old nanny      seller's saw, "Oh, this goat gives about a gallon of milk a      day" . . . he may in fact mean, "The least she gives is a      gallon a day throughout a 10-to 11-month lactation period."      On the other hand, the animal dealer might just as easily      be saying, "On her best milking day last year, ol' Nan gave      nearly three quarts . . . and she dried up after about      three months."    </p>    <p>      Folks here in Kansas emphasize the importance of records in      their own way: "Without good tab sheets, you got no idea      where you've been to get where you are . . . which means      you are lost . . . which means moving in any direction will      more than likely get you further lost." Don't get "lost" in      your livestock-raising enterprise . . . always keep      accurate, complete, and meaningful records.    </p>    <h3>      CARETAKING YOUR ANIMALS    </h3>    <p>      VII. Build your animal housing well. Once you have the best      possible livestock and record system, your main      responsibility will be providing for your animals' care . .      . and shelter is one of any creature's most basic needs.      Many people tend to think of animal housing as more of a      cold- than a hot-weather necessity, but the reverse is      actually true. Beasts and fowl can maintain their normal      body temperatures even in a snowy winter . . . if they're      kept dry and out of the wind. After all, that's what the      critters' wool, fur, or feathers are for. (You can help      stoke the animals' heat-making digestive furnaces,      too-during those extracrisp cold snaps-by giving them some      additional food.)    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, hot weather can really sap a critter's      vitality and health. So all of your livestock will need      some place-like a big shade tree or a homemade shelter-to      get away from searing summer sun.    </p>    <p>      And whether your "critter cottages" are designed for      protection from heat or cold (or both), the homes must be      adequately ventilated . . . because too much shelter is      worse than too little. The humidity that can build up-in a      confined area-from a farm animal's breathing, urine,      manure, and body heat will make an otherwise healthy      inhabitant more susceptible to pneumonia than if that same      beast had endured the weather outdoors. On my farm, we      dealt with that problem by making all our solid, leakproof      animal shelters completely open on the south side (away      from the prevailing winds). If your barnyard structures      don't have such exposed ends, be sure to provide the      enclosures with adequate ventilation holes.    </p>    <p>      Your farmstead fauna will also need a protective fence      around their yard or pasture . . . both to keep harmful      varmints-like our local coyotes-out and to keep your own      livestock in. And believe me . . . constructing a barricade      strong enough to contain those furred and feath ered      farmhands can be quite a hassle. Sheep and goats will poke      their heads into a small fence gap often enough to force      open a fullsized exit hole . .. horses and cows walk      through walls you'd think would stop a bulldozer . . .      while birds cart fly over, hogs root under, and rabbits      gnaw through just about every imaginable man-made barrier.      All in all, animals seem to act as if folks build fences      solely to provide "escape practice". So always make your      enclosures as sturdy as possible.    </p>    <p>      VIII. Feed the critters correctly. Although animals need      the same kinds of food that we humans do-protein,      carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water-each      critter must have a specific diet balanced to its own      requirements. And since scientists have figured out the      exact proportions of feed mixture necessary to help each      animal do exactly what it's intended to do (for instance,      young-chick chow contains 20-25% protein . . . while      laying-hen food has only 16-18%n protein but higher vitamin      and mineral quantities), the easiest solution to your      feeding problems is prepackaged commercial food made      specifically for your livestock's needs.    </p>    <p>      Most of us, however, want to use up some of the produce and      leftovers we have around-and save a little food-bill money      besides-by feeding farm animals on farm food. Well, you      darn near have to have a graduate degree in nutrition to      figure out your own homegrown, full-time livestock feed . .      . but you can effectively "stretch" those commercial      products with your own growing''.    </p>    <p>      However, any supplemental feeding must be based upon a      knowledge of your barnyard denizens' eating habits. Of      course, such understanding will include knowing the types      of things the beasts like to ingest (goats enjoy the      occasional fresh tree limb, for example). But you must also      know how your critters eat. You can't-for instance-safely      give the same small bones to dogs (aggressive gulpers) that      you can feed to hogs (fastidious chewers).    </p>    <p>      Beginning homesteaders often-with the best intentions-make      one of the worst feeding mistakes of all: They overstuff      their livestock. Fat animals won't breed, often give little      milk, and supply poor-tasting (and feed-wasting) meat. All      in all, such "tubbies" are just about useless. So if you've      got an animal that's overweight, cut back on its grub and      keep the "obeastie" on a diet until it returns to normal      weight . . . or butcher the animal before it gets any      fatter.    </p>    <p>      Finally, don't neglect the most important requirement of      all animals: fresh water. Your livestock must have a      continuous supply of the life-giving liquid. So-unless the      critters have access to a clean, flowing stream-you should      replenish their water at least twice a day.    </p>    <p>      IX. Coddle the "youngsters". Raising healthy animal babies      will keep you in the livestock business longer than any      other single thing you can do. So go ahead and SPOIL your      "litter critters". You'll be rewarded for any amount of      extra effort you put into keeping those small fry healthy .      . . with more vital-and more productive-adults.    </p>    <p>      To take care of the offspring, you have to prepare for      their birth well in advance. Circle the anticipated day on      your calendar, gather up everything you'll need (from heat      lamps to iodine), and check your expectant mother several      times each day.    </p>    <p>      When the "little strangers" do arrive, the care you give      them will-of course-depend on what type of young'uns they      are . . . so be sure that you know the babies' specific      needs. All newborns must be dried off (momma may do this      with her tongue) and be provided with a clean, draft-free      bed, but some of them have a few special requirements . . .      like 80-90°F temperatures for the first few days. And      by the way, be sure all your mammal babies get that first      drink of colostrum (antibody-laden milk) straight from      their mothers.    </p>    <p>      Take care of your young critters, and they'll grow up to      take care of you.    </p>    <p>      X. Help your animals prevent their own disease. If you      follow the first nine animal-care commandments, you'll      already be doing a great deal to keep your livestock      healthy. These last few tips will help birds and beasts      avoid catching their own species-specific "bug and worm"      diseases.    </p>    <p>      [1] Make sure that every part of your animals' environment      is scrupulously clean. I emphasized the importance of      keeping livestock away from their own manure in my last      article ("How to Deal With Internal Parasites, Part II" in      MOTHER NO. 57, pages 56-58), so I'll simply say here that      if cleanliness is next to godliness, dirtiness is next to      disease.    </p>    <p>      [2] Don't bring illness onto your homestead. Buy animals      that are not sick . . . and quarantine them for a few weeks      to be certain the newcomers aren't carrying some unnoticed      disease. Also, be sure to wear boots when you visit other      folks' livestock areas . . . and disinfect that footwear      afterward.    </p>    <p>      [3] Remember that parasites and "regional" bugs are your      animal's biggest problems, so set up good worm control and      vaccination programs with your local veterinarian.    </p>    <h3>      IN CONCLUSION    </h3>    <p>      If you look over these TEN COMMANDMENTS FOR HEALTHY      LIVESTOCK, you'll realize they don't involve a lot of      grueling extra work. Nope, you can keep all your critters      fit with a minimum of fuss or muss. What preventive animal      health does involve, though, is using your head. You've      heard the old saying: "An ounce of prevention is worth a      pound of cure." Well, I'm going to add to that all-too-true      proverb by rewriting it this way: When it comes to keeping      livestock well and productive, an ounce of prevention comes      from using that pound of gray matter between your ears!    </p>    <p><strong>      EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong> More of Randy Kidd's livestock and pet care      advice can be found in MOTHER NOS. 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, and      57.
