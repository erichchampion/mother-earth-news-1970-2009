                <p>      <strong>      TO YOUR HEALTH</strong></p>					<p>By the editors of      <em>American Health</em> magazine.</p>    <p>      <em>When it concerns the fitness of body, mind or spirit,      the editors at</em> American Health <em>are there, staying      on top of up-to-date medical research, separating fads from      facts, and helping you preserve and improve life's most      precious gift - your good health. In this new column,      we bring you just a few items culled from their current and      upcoming issues, which - among a mass of other      information - focus in on a healthy heart.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Halting Heart Attacks</strong>    </p>        <p>      New techniques and drugs are enabling doctors to literally      halt a heart attack in progress, thereby limiting cardiac      damage and improving chances for recovery. Most heart      attack victims, however, wait three hours before seeking      help. By that time, as much as 40% of the affected heart      muscle may be lost.    </p>    <p>      Classic symptoms of a heart attack include crushing chest      pain that radiates to the jaw or left arm (and isn't      relieved by rest). It's often accompanied by nausea,      apprehension or dizziness. Sometimes there may be only a      heavy pressure or constriction across the chest. There may      be real pain of varying degree, which may or may not      radiate to the shoulder, neck, jaw, teeth, belly or arm.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Six Going on 40</strong>    </p>        <p>      The old one-dog-year-equals-seven-people-years formula is      "total nonsense," according to Dr. Alan Beck at the      University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.      More accurate guidelines were developed in 1953 by French      veterinarian A. LeBeau, but keep in mind that large breeds      of dogs have much shorter life spans than smaller breeds: 3      mos. = 5 yrs.; 6 mos. = 10 yrs.; 12 mos. = 15 yrs.; 2 yrs.      = 24 yrs.; 4 yrs. = 32 yrs.; 6 yrs. = 40 yrs.; 8 yrs. = 48      yrs.; 10 yrs. = 56 yrs.; 14 yrs. = 72 yrs.; 18 yrs. = 91      yrs.; 21 yrs. = 106 yrs.    </p>    <p>      You can equate a cat's age to human age by this same      guideline.    </p>        <p><strong>      Victory Over Viruses?    </strong></p>    <p>      A Harris poll of 227 medical scientists reveals that nearly      90% expect there'll be effective drugs to stimulate the      immune system, and 95% believe antiviral drugs will be used      effectively by the year 2000.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Is a Winter Tan Worth It?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Last year, the FDA reports, tanning salons sent some 2,500      to 5,000 people to emergency rooms with radiation injuries.      Though much of the public thinks UVA (ultraviolet A rays)      artificial tanning is safe, some of the machines give out      five times as much energy per unit of time as the sun, and      animal studies suggest you're more likely to develop skin      cancer if you use lamps plus sun than if you tan in the sun      alone.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Thin and Happy</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you're down about being overweight, taking an      antidepressant may compound the problem, because      antidepressants seem to stimulate weight-gain in some      people. Some drugs used to treat allergies, arthritis, skin      diseases and collagen disorders have similar effects, but      antidepressants are the worst offenders.    </p>    <p>      Now, however, there's an experimental antidepressant drug,      fluoxetine, that actually decreases cravings for sweets and      may prove to be an effective weight-loss agent as well, but      researchers are cautious. Bupropion, another drug that      seemed to lift depression without causing fatigue or weight      gain, was later found to induce seizures. In the meantime,      regular aerobic exercise has been shown to be as effective      in the treatment of mild depression as drugs, and will also      help take off unwanted pounds.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cholesterol Testing</strong>    </p>        <p>      Everyone over the age of 20 should have a cholesterol test,      but, remember, like blood pressure, a person's cholesterol      level fluctuates-up or down-with stress, weight      change, menstrual cycle, illness and medications.    </p>    <p>      While lovastatin, the first of a new class of      cholesterol-lowering drugs, can reduce heartunhealthy      cholesterol levels by 40%, its effect on coronary heart      disease and its longterm safety have not yet been      established. This and other drugs should be used only after      a stringent diet that cuts down on fatty foods has failed.      Getting the level down is vital, though, since every 1%      drop in serum cholesterol can lead to a 2% reduction in      heart attack risk.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kids, Diet and Heart Disease</strong>    </p>    <p>      A 15-year study in Bogalusa, Louisiana, is trying to      determine to what extent childhood lifestyle can contribute      to eventual heart problems. "We have found that heart      disease risk factors track quite well as a child grows      older," says Larry Weber, chief statistician for the study.      "This causes us to believe that things like obesity and      high blood pressure are not harmless in youth, but in fact      can contribute to heart disease later in life."    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the number of obese children in this country      has almost doubled between 1963 and 1980.    </p>
