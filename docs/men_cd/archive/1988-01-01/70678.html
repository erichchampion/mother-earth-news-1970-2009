                <p><strong>SEASONS OF THE GARDEN</strong></p>		<h5 id="byline">   by Greg and Pat Williams     </h5>    		<p>From mutant tomatoes to colored mulch.</p>		<p>      Pesticide concern is on the rise. According to a national      Gallup poll of 1,500 households, 88% of consumers rank the      safety of a pesticide they use as more important than its      effectiveness. Indeed, 55% of the pesticideusing      respondents said their worries about the dangers of using      chemical insect controls have risen in just the past three      years.    </p>        <p>      Such concerns are spreading to the commercial landscaping      and tree-service industries, as well. The nationwide      tree-care firm Davey Tree & Expert Co., for instance,      is reducing its pesticide use on trees and shrubs by 75% by      using customized sprayers and Safer-brand insecticidal      soaps.    </p>    <p>      A few firms are going 100% cold turkey. Frank Harder,      president of Harder Landscape Contractors in Hempstead,      Connecticut, has quit using pesticides entirely-after      relying on them for 40 years. Why? He felt uneasy about the      presumed "short- and long-term innocence" of pesticides,      the concerns expressed by his employees who were exposed to      the sprays, the high cost of using them and the increasing      risk of liability suits. Now he concentrates on cultural      methods for maintaining healthy plants, saying, "We believe      neglect is the real enemy that is generally fought by      chemical warfare." The results? His business is growing,      and "we sleep nights."    </p>    <p>      Even some lawn-care companies have gone organic. Mike      Merner, of Charlestown, Rhode Island, dropped the      chemical-intensive lawn-care approach when he saw the      vicious cycle of dependency it created. Now he runs the      Organic Landscape Company and guarantees that the lawns he      cares for won't have insect or disease problems. What      secret ingredient does he use to maintain such wonderfully      robust home turf? Compost. He makes it himself out of      livestock manure, fish scraps and plant clippings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Research Briefs</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Colored mulch boosts yields.</strong> Red mulch has      been found to increase tomato fruit size and number, and      white mulch aided pepper and potato production. Research in      this area is just beginning, but the future could hold      "designer gardens" with rainbowlike arrays of mulch.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nix to early pruning.</strong> University of      Connecticut researchers report that, in a mild winter,      January pruning of apple trees caused excessive bark      splitting and death. February pruning was much less      harmful.    </p>        <p>      Two thousand mutant tomatoes. The Tomato Genetics Stock      Center (Dept. of Vegetable Crops, University of California,      Davis, CA 95616) is a seed repository for over 2,000 tomato      mutants, wild species and primitive varieties. This      collection is vital for breeding improved varieties; and      most of its stock comes from farmers and gardeners. So      please let the TGSC know about any "weird" tomatoes you've      been growing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Keep bare roots moist.</strong> If you ordered any      bare-root nursery stock for next spring, be sure to keep it      moist until you can plant it. Researcn indicates that      adequate moisture is the most important factor for keeping      such stock alive and healthy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Inert may hurt.</strong> Even the so-called inert      ingredients in pesticides may be harmful. The EPA has      evaluated about a quarter of the over 1,000 inert compounds      in commercial chemical sprays and found 100 of these either      potentially or significantly toxic.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Planting by the plants.</strong> Phenology is the      study of the timing of biological events in relation to      climate. The old farmer's advice to plant corn (or look for      morel mushrooms) when oak leaves reach the size of a      squirrel's ears is a down-to-earth example of a      phenological correlation. Dr. James Duke (Herbal Vineyard,      Fulton, MD 20708) thinks such biological indicators are      better at predicting the appropriate timing for planting      and harvesting than the current mathematical, degree-day      models. If you'd like to help him with his Independent      Phenology Research Project, send a long SASE to Dr. Duke      for a copy of his record-keeping chart.    </p>        <p>      Borate those beams. Borate treatment may become the      standard preservation technique for wood used in gardens      and greenhouses; the materials are low-cost and not very      toxic. Just soak fresh-sawn wood in a concentrated solution      of borate salt (such as sodium borate) and air-dry the      wood. It's then protected against powder-post beetles      termites, mildew and decay fungi.

Wallace (Chestnut Hill Nursery, Inc., Rt. 1,      Box 341, Alachua, FL 32615) claims that Revival, his new,      patented hybrid American-Chinese chestnut, has the best      features of both its parents: upright growth, blight      resistance and large, sweet nuts ....
