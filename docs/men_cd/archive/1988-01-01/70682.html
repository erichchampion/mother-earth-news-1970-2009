                <p>      <strong>MOTHER'S CHILDREN</strong>    </p>        <p>      Two brothers earn while they learn. By Benjamin and Joseph      Watson    </p>    <p>      Three years ago, when we were nine (Joseph) and eight      (Benjamin), we met a lady who sold homemade bread at local      fairs and meetings. We liked the idea, so we asked our mom      if we could get a Bosch bread maker and start our own      business: Watson Bread Brothers.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      BY ben jamin and Joseph Watson    </h5>        <p>      We made some mistakes at first-like on the first      batch when we poured all the water into the bowl of flour      instead of the other way around. One time we.forgot to put      the yeast in the dough. The bread looked sort of funny in      the oven-it wouldn't rise! We tried sprinkling a      little bit of yeast on top of the loaves, but that didn't      work.    </p>        <p>      We worked out our problems, though, and now we're doing      swell. We grind our own flour with a flour mill and make      four to six loaves of honey-sweetened, whole wheat bread at      a time. We normally sell 16 loaves of bread a week at $2      each (we could probably sell them for $2.50). One time we      baked 100 loaves for a school fair (it took us two weeks)      and made $200 in one day! We deposited more than $1,000 in      our savings account in our first year of doing business.    </p>    <p>      We're also Bosch dealers, earning commissions from selling      the company's flour mill, bread maker and other kitchen      machines. We school at home with our mom, so our bread      business is an important part of our education We do our      own bookkeeping, ordering, banking, promotional planning      and tax reporting as well as our regular school lessons.      And we still find time to ski, bike, fish, camp and play      touch football.    </p>    <p>      Having your own business is fun. You can make a lot more      money than most kids get in allowances, and it makes us      happy to know people are getting good nutrition from eating      our 100% whole wheat bread. We realize most kids can't      afford $500 for a bread maker and flour mill. Maybe you      could do like we did-our mom bought the machines and,      in exchange, we give her at least two loaves of bread each      week. <em>[Editor's Note: Emily Murphy - see the      sidebar - runs a home baking business without either      machine.]</em>    </p>    <p>      After three really great years, we're convinced: A home      bread business really is a great way to earn while you      learn.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      BREAD & BAGELS    </h2>    <p>    By Emily Murphy    </p>        <p>      I really enjoy baking bread. After a hard afternoon of      being interrupted by my little sister Clare while I'm      trying to figure out algebra problems, I can take out all      my frustrations on the bread I'm kneading. It's also fun      putting a little ball of dough in the bottom of a greased      bowl, covering it with a towel, placing it in a sunny      window and coming back an hour later to find it's risen all      the way to the top of the bowl.    </p>    <p>      About a year ago, I started selling bread. Mom and Dad      invested $9.26 in flour, honey, milk powder, corn oil, salt      and yeast to get me started. I decided to sell my loaves      for $1.75 each.    </p>    <p>      I made a flier and asked my dad to make some photocopies of      it at work. When he got home, he told me two secretaries      saw him copying the flier and both ordered some. I was      ecstatic! After I stopped dancing, I made the bread.    </p>    <p>      I make either 100% whole wheat bread or half-white,      half-whole wheat, according to my customer's taste. I make      three loaves at a time, selling two to my regular customers      (I have five). The third one goes to Mom at a reduced rate      to pay for the use of the oven.    </p>    <p>      Before you sell a new product, you have to experiment with      it until you get it right (your family will make excellent      guinea pigs). I'd been making bread for a long time before      I marketed it, but about a year ago my grandmother, a bagel      fanatic, asked me to start making and selling bagels. I dug      out a whole wheat bagel recipe. The first thing that struck      me was that you have to boil bagels in water for five      minutes. I couldn't imagine why, but I mixed up the dough,      kneaded it and let it rise twice. Then I boiled some water      and dropped four puny-looking bagels into it. Five minutes      later, I lifted the bagels out and was flabbergasted. They      were three times bigger than before! I finished boiling and      baking them. They were too salty and crumbly, but were      still delicious. I've since cut down on the salt and      learned to put them together more firmly-and now I'm      ready to sell bagels as well as bread.    </p>
