                <p>      <strong>Bits and Pieces</strong>    </p>    		<p>      "Would you prefer plain, carbonated, boreholed, or natural      spring, sir?"    </p>		<h5 id="byline">By Scott Patterson</h5>            <p>      On November 13, 1995, the FDA, after much delay, published      regulations that will allegedly clean up the bottled water      indus try. A major aspect of the FDA regulations stems from      a practice in which over 50 percent of the bottled water      industry participate--borehole drilling. Water      obtained from a borehole does not naturally flow from a      spring but rather, like well water, is forcefully sucked      from the ground with hydraulic pumps.    </p>    <p>      The dilemma before the FDA in November of '95 was this: is      it truthful to label water drilled from a borehole "natural      spring water." The FDA decided that no substantial      difference exists, and as long as the borehole water is      identical to the water that flows from the spring, the      "natural spring water" label may remain.    </p>    <p>      But is there really no difference between naturally flowing      spring water and borehole water, or do those who actually      market naturally emerging spring water wish to create a      controversy when there essentially is none? Besides having      a rather ominous name, is borehole water safe?    </p>    <p>      Many hydrogeologists believe that water pumped from      aquifers near springs can change as a result of intense      pressures the suction creates. Boreholes pump out hundreds      of gallons per minute, creating a suction in the      surrounding region which draws water from areas not      associated with the spring. Contaminated ground water can      then enter the borehole area, something that ostensibly      could never happen in a natural spring.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SPRING WATER:</strong><br />      a flow of water rising or issuing naturally from the      earth.<br />      <em>(Oxford English Dictionary)</em>    </p>    <p>      "By definition the borehole will be shallow," said Dr.      Susan N. Boutros, president of Environmental Associates, in      a letter to the FDA in 1993. "Wells less than fifty feet in      depth," she continues, "and [those] less than 200 feet from      a surface water are considered at risk of surface      contamination."    </p>    <p>      Bill Sharp, a professor of geology at Penn State, asserts:      "You can create a situation where water from surrounding      areas flows towards the borehole, especially in boreholes      close to the surface, creating the possibility of higher      contaminants." Contaminants such as cryptosparidium and      giardia can enter the aquifer through surface water. There      are no federal stipulations for the appropriate depth of a      borehole.    </p>    <p>      As if that were not complicated enough, boreholes can      interrupt the natural flow of the aquifer that feeds the      spring. Bill Miller, president of the National Spring Water      Association, says that boreholes "upset the equilibrium" of      a spring. Miller compares borehole drilling to stripmining      for gold or clear-cutting forests, rapidly depleting water      resources. In Nacodoches, Texas, Ozarka, a bottled water      company owned by Perrier, had to abandon a spring that      became contaminated by manganese. Many experts believe the      poisoning resulted from the pumping of the spring. Citizens      in Fort Worth lobbied unsuccessfully against Ozarka's      borehole drilling at Rohr Spring, which impacts a community      of 5,000. Dale Groom, head of the citizens action      committee, claims the borehole will drain privately owned      wells. "We have this foreign-owned bottler who has come in      and is taking people's water," says Groom. On March 8, one      week after pumping began, the well of Bart Sipriano, which      lies half a mile from the Ozarka site, went dry.    </p>        <p>      Jim Heaton, former president of the NSWA, says that      borehole drilling can "destroy a watershed area." "Our      watershed areas are becoming slim for pure and natural      water," Heaton claims. "Water systems are becoming old. If      we don't protect these watersheds in the future, then what      will our children do for clean, safe water?"    </p>    <p>      The International Bottled Water Association, which      represents nearly 85 percent of bottled water companies      including Perrier, Poland Spring, and Ozarka, favors      regulations allowing drilled water to be labeled as spring      water. Tyrone Wilson, a spokesman for the IBWA, says, "We      know it's not the best system, but we're happy with it."    </p>    <p>      The 1995 ruling says that any borehole water chemically      different from the water that emerges naturally from the      spring cannot have a natural spring label. But many      question the efficacy of the FDA to monitor the industry.      Mark Izeman of the National Resources Defense Council says,      "The FDA is anemic. Any promise they make to enforce a      ruling is really farcical." The FDA admits that it does not      individually monitor the bottled water industry but rather      relies largely on self-regulation by the bottlers. The FDA      randomly tests for contaminants by taking samples from      supermarket shelves.    </p>    <p>      Bottled water is certainly one of the safest, purest food      products on the market today. Even borehole water is in      general extremely safe. A wide array of postextraction      purifying tech niques such as ozone and radiation treatment      provide a high percentage of safety. As Eddie Lauth, owner      of AquaPenn, a naturally emerging spring water company in      Pennsylvania, states, "What is more important than how the      water is extracted is how the water is treated afterwards."      Yet, as many experts believe, borehole water is potentially      less pure than natural spring water. Contaminants can      escape the purification barrage that water undergoes, as      the infamous Perrier incident of the early 90s proved when      bottles of Perrier had to be pulled off the shelves due to      contamination by small traces of benzene. The FDA, however,      along with the IBWA, feels that this difference isn't      significant enough to notify the public through      distinctions in labeling. Others are not so sure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Kinder, Gender Dinners</strong>    </p>        <p>      Market forces have finally brought megastores such as      Safeway, Giant, and Food Emporium to begin stocking animal      produce that has been brought to market with some concern      for the animals' welfare.    </p>    <p>      Often this simply means that animals have been raised on      organic feed and with less reliance on hormones and      antibiotics.    </p>    <p>      Although the USDA is working on an "organic" classification      label that will cover meat and poultry, for now consumers      must do a little research on individual company brands. The      Humane Society prints a brochure of preferred producers,      and other groups, like the Food Animals Concern Trust, have      started lending their imprimatur to companies that meet      their ethical criteria.    </p>    <p>      The founder of Coleman Natural Meats, which did a brisk $40      million in business last year, sees a watershed in American      agriculture approaching. Farmers, ranchers, and academics      pulled together, he says, to meet the postwar challenge of      growing cheaper food more efficiently, says Mel Coleman,      who sits on an advisory board of the Humane Society. Now,      says Coleman, whose grandchildren will be the sixth      generation of ranchers in his family, American livestock      producers must cede the low-cost producer status to      countries like Mexico and Indonesia and position      themselves, and American agriculture, to "raise      high-quality foods sustainably for markets everywhere." A      self-described Archie Bunker Republican, Coleman says      anyone can be green. With almost evan gelical zeal he      explains that when you raise cattle on rangeland grasses      rather than exclusively on grain "you don't use anything      but the sun's energy."    </p>        <p>      Ironically, as many Americans have cut back on their intake      of red meat and switched to poultry, they have cast their      food-dollar ballot in favor of the most intensive of all      the livestock industries. Snarfing back mounds of succulent      white meat, most people don't consider the pervasive      practice of debeaking, nor do they care whether the bird      spent its entire life without taking a dust bath. The      curtailment, or all-out suppression, of innate      drives-what veterinarians call pathogenic      conditions-leads ultimately to antisocial and unnatural      behaviors. Stress-induced illnesses lead only to further      "corrective" measures by the factory farm caretaker.    </p>    <p>      But before we can dive into a bucket of free-range chicken,      Karen Davis, founder of United Poultry Concerns, cautions      that "terms like <em>free range</em> ...sound like Disney      fantasyland and that's about what they are." The label      makes consumers feel good because they are allowed to      imagine birds strutting in the low grass, clucking in the      sun. Reality sometimes comes closer to 100,000 longhorns      crammed together on a gymnasium floor. Even under the best      of circumstances, the animals' essential natures are still      suppressed.    </p>    <p>      It comes to a question of degrees, and of personal      tolerances. Consumers are learning, as Humane Society      vice-president for bioethics Michael W. Fox puts it, that      "it's not what [statements] come out of your mouth, it's      what you put <em>into</em> your mouth that can really make      a difference:'    </p>    <p>      "People are asking for change in terms of agriculture and      livestock production;" says Organic Trade Association      director Katherine DiMatteo, "We're just at the point of      breaking the industry wide open:'    </p>    <p>      -David U.
