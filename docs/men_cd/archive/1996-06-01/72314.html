            		<p><strong>Mother's Kitchen</strong></p>            <p>      Michigan is fighting the title of Cherry Capital of the      World, and Anne Vassal defends the home turf with the best      fruit recipes you've ever tasted. We can't wait for our      annual journey to southwestern Michigan for a day of cherry      pickin'. Those ripe, juicy cherries almost fall into our      hands, with many of them ending up in our mouths. None of      those supermarket Pacific Bing cherries for me, nor would I      dream of buying hard, tasteless South American or New      Zealand cherries in the dead of winter. I can wait for the      real thing. OK, so I'm a slightly biased ex-Michiganer, but      cherries don't get any better than Traverse City in      mid-July. (Door County, Wisconsin, is close behind.) Last      summer my teenage son ate two pounds of sweet cherries      while traveling home alone on a plane from Traverse City.      His excuse for not saving me even one was, "They were too      good." Anyway, after we pick more cherries than we can      possibly consume, we treat ourselves to a huge piece of      cherry pie from the local bakery. (Sure, I know there's      lard in the crust but I don't care.)    </p>        <p>      Even though Traverse City, Michigan, and Vignola, Italy,      both claim to be the cherry capital of the world (Traverse      City grows more cherries but Vignola's been growing them      longer), it's the Pacific Northwest that accounts for 70      percent of the sweet cherry production, while Michigan      produces three-quarters of our sour (or tart) cherries. Why      have a sour cherry? Mostly, they're needed for commercial      processing into frozen and canned products such as pie      filling. Some folks swear by fresh sour cherries for their      homemade pies. And we can thank those same cherry plants      for producing the maraschino cherries swirling in the      bottom of our Shirley Temple cocktails.    </p>    <p>      Nutritionally, cherries are very much like most fruit in      that they contain antioxidants such as vitamin C and      betacarotene. Plus, they are loaded with fiber, and studies      have shown that fruit fiber can help fight high blood      pressure, heart disease, and certain types of cancers. Take      advantage of this season's cherries by using them in      muffins, pancakes, fruit shakes, salsas, salads, jams, and      of course, pies. And there's no need to limit cherries just      to desserts. Ray Pleva, a butcher in Cedar, Michigan, found      this out when he began to experiment with using tart      cherries in his ground beef and sausage. It was only after      his daughter was crowned National Cherry Queen that Ray      became aware of some of the problems facing Michigan's      troubled cherry industry. He not only developed a      healthier, better-tasting burger but he found that the      cherries' antioxidants kept the meat fresher longer. Ray      continues to make a dent in Michigan's cherry surplus by      distributing his cherry meat all over the country.    </p>    <p>      This brings to mind the question of why everyone east of      the Mississippi is buying Northwest cherries at the      supermarket instead of locally grown fruit. According to      James Flore, professor of horticulture at Michigan State      University, rain is the industry's biggest problem. "Ripe      berries will split open if they get wet at the wrong time,      making the crop unpredictable." Supermarket chains can't      gamble on the weather when they've placed orders and      arranged for advertisements months in advance, says a      Chicago produce manager. Sure, Northwest growers have the      same problem but their huge industry can afford overhead      orchard fans or helicopters to blow the water off the      cherry orchards. Once again, big business reigns. But who      needs jet-lagged fruit? Take a drive and find a local      produce stand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Choosing Cherries</strong>    </p>    <p>      The most popular Northwest sweet cherry is the venerable      Bing. These large cherries will be a dark burgundy color      when fully ripened. The smaller, heart-shaped Lambert      cherry is similar in taste to the Bing. A strange-looking      yellowish cherry is an extra-sweet hybrid called the      Rainier. In the Midwest, the Schmidt is a variety similar      to the Bing. Other sweet cherry varieties of that region      are the Emperor Francis and the Rainier. Tart cherries can      sometimes be found at local farm stands for use in pies and      preserves. When picking out fresh cherries, make sure      they're firm (but not hard) and without soft spots or      bruises. The stems should be green and not darkened with      age. Wash the cherries and pat dry and then store them in a      plastic container for up to two weeks. Cherries deteriorate      rapidly if they're not kept refrigerated.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cherry Coffee Cake</strong>    </p>    <p>      This easy coffee cake can be made even faster in a food      processor, and it's great for more than just breakfast.    </p>        <p>      Topping:    </p>    <p>      <em>1 tablespoon hard or partially frozen butter, chopped      into cubes</em> <em><br /></em> <em>1 teaspoon flour<br />      1 tablespoon brown sugar<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      2 tablespoons thin oats</em>    </p>    <p>      Cake:    </p>    <p>      <em>1/4 cup canola oil (or any mild oil)<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      1 tablespoon sugar<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1 large egg<br />      1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />      1/2 cup low fat buttermilk<br />      1 1/2 cups sifted whole wheat pastry flour or unbleached      white flour<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br /></em> <em>1 cup fresh or      frozen cherries, halved (sweet or tart cherries)</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 350°F In a food processor or using      a strong fork, mix the topping ingredients (except the      oats) until small crumbs form. Briefly mix in the oats.      Pour into a bowl and set aside. Lightly grease an 8- or      9-inch round cake pan. In the processor or using a mixer,      mix well the ingredients up to the buttermilk. Stir      together the flour, baking powder, and soda. Briefly mix      into the wet mixture. Pour half the batter into the pan.      Spoon the cherries evenly over the batter. Spoon the rest      of the batter over the cherries. (Some will show through.)    </p>    <p>      Sprinkle on the topping. Bake for 30-35 minutes until      lightly browned and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.      Cool for ten minutes before slicing into wedges.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Grilled Chicken Salad with Cherry      Vinaigrette</strong>    </p>    <p>      Next time you have the grill fired up, grill a few extra      chicken breasts for a summer salad the following day.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 boneless chicken breasts, cut in half to make four      pieces (about 1/4 pound each)</em> <em><br /></em>      <em>olive oil, salt, freshly ground pepper<br />      optional: fresh herbs such as thyme and rosemary<br />      about 8 cups assorted garden lettuce or greens such as baby      romaine, leaf, red oak, endive, arugula, spinach (about 1/2      pound)<br />      1 medium red onion, halved and sliced thin<br />      10-15 radishes, sliced thin</em>    </p>    <p>      Vinaigrette:    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup fresh cherries, pitted<br /></em> <em>2 1/2      tablespoons balsamic vinegar<br />      2 tablespoons canola oil (or any mild oil)<br />      1 tablespoon sugar<br />      1/2 cup cherry juice<br /></em> <em>2 teaspoons grated      ginger root (peeled first), dash salt, cayenne pepper      and/or freshly ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      I n a blender, combine the ingredients for the vinaigrette.      Chill in a jar until ready to use. (The dressing can be      strained for a smoother appearance.) Brush the chicken with      oil and sprinkle with salt, ground pepper, and any fresh      herbs you may have. Grill and chill until needed. Wash and      dry the salad greens. Toss with the onions and radishes.      Slice the chicken diagonally into thin strips. Just before      serving, toss the lettuce and vinaigrette. Lay the salad on      the plates and top with the sliced chicken. Garnish with      chopped fresh herbs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Maple Cherry Sauce</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's a sauce that can be used hot or cold as a topping      for grilled meats, yogurt, ice cream, or cheesecake. We      used it instead of frosting for chocolate birthday      cupcakes. Tart cherries may be used but you'll need to      adjust the sweetening.    </p>    <p>      <em>1/4 cup cherry juice or juice blend</em> <em><br />      </em> <em>1 1/2 teaspoons arrowroot flour*<br />      2 tablespoons real maple syrup<br />      2 cups pitted fresh or frozen sweet cherries, halved</em>      <em><br /></em><br />      In a glass measuring cup, whisk together the juice and      flour. In a large skillet, pour in the juice and the maple      syrup. Stir over medium heat until the sauce starts to      thicken. Add the cherries and simmer until they soften,      smashing them a bit. Don't overcook. If the sauce isn't      thick enough, whisk a little arrowroot flour (about one      teaspoon) together with a tablespoon of juice and then add      to the sauce. Cool or serve hot. It thickens a little as it      cools. Option: 1 teaspoon grated orange rind or 1      tablespoon brandy. The recipe will make one cup of sauce.    </p>    <p>      *Arrowroot flour is a healthier and better-tasting      alternative to cornstarch. It can be found at health food      stores.<br />      <br />      <strong>Cherry Cheesecake Bars</strong>    </p>    <p>      These low-fat bars are an easy dessert to take to a family      barbecue. Just remember to start the yogurt cheese the day      before. This recipe makes a big batch.<br />      <br />      <em>3 cups low fat vanilla yogurt (for yogurt cheese).      Brands that contain modified food starch and/or gelatin      won't form correctly, so I use either Dannon low fat or      Stonyfield Farm.<br /></em> <em>2 cups Maple Cherry Sauce      (see page 69)</em>    </p>        <p>      Crust:    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups crushed graham crackers (Frookie makes a      healthier cracker.)</em><br />      <em>5 tablespoons mild oil (canola)<br /></em> <em>2      tablespoons brown sugar</em>    </p>    <p>      Filling:    </p>    <p>      <em>1 1/2 cups yogurt cheese<br />      2</em> <em>eight-ounce packages "lite" cream cheese      (Neufchatel)<br />      1/2 cup real maple syrup<br />      2 teaspoons vanilla<br />      2 large eggs</em>    </p>    <p>      The day before: Line a colander with cheesecloth or a      nonterrycloth dishtowel. Pour in the yogurt and let drain      in the sink or a pan for at least 12 hours but not more      than 18 or so. If it's 80°F or above, it might be a      good idea to stick the colander in the refrigerator. It      will take a little longer this way. When the yogurt is      almost the consistency of cream cheese, remove from the      dishtowel and store in a plastic container in the      refrigerator until ready to use. It will keep about three      days. Preheat oven to 350°F. Have a 9-by-13-inch pan      ready. Place the crackers in a large Zip-Lock bag and crush      with a rolling pin. In the processor or by hand, mix the      oil and sugar into the crackers. Pat into the cake pan. In      the processor or using a mixer, beat the yogurt cheese and      cream cheese together. Beat in the maple syrup and vanilla,      then the eggs. Bake for 40 minutes until the top is lightly      browned and the center has puffed up. (It will fall when      cooled.) Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at      least three hours. Just before serving, spread with the      cherry sauce and cut into bars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TOO</strong> <strong>MANY CHERRIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      IF YOU'VE MANAGED to acquire such a bumper crop that you      need to store your fruit for more than a couple of weeks,      freezing and drying are the best bets. The only equipment      you'll need beforehand is a cherry pitter and surgical      gloves (unless you want red hands for days). To freeze, lay      the washed cherries, pitted or not, on a jelly roll pan in      a single layer and place in the freezer. When they're      solid, place in labeled Zip-Lock freezer bags and they      should keep well for up to a year. Never defrost cherries,      however, before using in your cooking or baking because      they become a mushy mess.    </p>    <p>      IF YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF RAISINS, you haven't lived until      you've tried dried cherries. This is a great way to use up      overripe or smashed fruit, and they are an incredible      addition to muffins, granola, cookies, and grain dishes.      Arrange cherries (if sliced, place skin side down) on      foil-covered cookie sheets or jelly roll pans. Place in a      200°F oven for four to five hours until the cherries      are shriveled. They should be leathery and slightly sticky,      not hard. Cool, then store in Zip-Lock bags or plastic      containers. I recommend storing homemade dried fruit in the      refrigerator or freezer because moisture still present in      the fruit may cause some bacterial growth. Dried fruit will      also taste fresher longer if kept in a cool place.<br />    </p>
