                    <p>      <strong>Country Lore</strong>    </p>        <p>      Better cleaning, and an explosive way to deal with fire      ants.    </p>    <p>      My father-in-law and I put in a garden every year, but as      anyone living in Kansas knows, our summers can get pretty      hot. We had a drought last summer and had trouble      conserving water and watering the garden. So we went to the      hardware store and bought some PVC pipe which we hooked up      to the drain on the washing machine. While washing the      clothes, I also irrigated the garden so that all the crops      could profit from this rig. The soap (which is      biodegradable) also helped keep the bugs off the plants.    </p>    <p>      -Chad Ratliff<br />      Fort Scott, KS    </p>        <p><strong>Homemade Stain Remover</strong></p>    <p>      To clean tough household stains, store this mix for future      use in a large glass jar.    </p>    <p>      <em>1/2 cup baking soda<br /></em> <em>1/2 cup powdered      detergent<br />      1/4 cup salt</em>    </p>    <p>      -Amy Ceader<br />      Danville, IL    </p>    <p>      <strong>Insider Garden Galoshes</strong>    </p>    <p>      I save the bags that my newspaper is delivered in. Whenever      I go out to work on "my little acre" I slip a pair of these      little bags on over my socks, then put on my work shoes.      This keeps both my feet and socks clean when I'm finished      with a day's gardening and yard work.    </p>    <p>      -L. B. Felton<br />      Chesapeake, VA    </p>    <p>      <strong>Homemade Play Dough & Paints</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here is a recipe for play dough for parents or caregivers      who don't wish to pay the ridiculously high price for such      a product. I have also included a cheap, fun recipe for      finger paints.    </p>    <p>      Play Dough:    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups of fl</em> <em>our<br />      1 cup of salt<br />      2 cups of water<br />      1/4 cup of oil<br />      1 tablespoon of cream of tartar<br />      1 package (small) of Kool-Aid or flavored drink crystals      and corresponding food coloring.</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix all ingredients over medium-high heat until they are      dough-like. Remember to stir constantly throughout the      process. Add drink crystals and food coloring until you get      the color you want. Knead and store in an airtight      container. The drink crystals will give the dough a      delightful smell (of the flavor) as well as color. It will      keep for about one to two weeks if you store it in an      airtight container when you're not playing with it.    </p>    <p>      Soap Flake Finger Paints:    </p>    <p>      <em>2 cups of soap flakes (not powder)</em><br />      <em>water</em><br />      <em>food coloring</em>    </p>    <p>      In a bowl gradually add water to soap flakes while beating      with a rotary or electric mixer. The soap should be the      consistency of beaten egg whites with soft peaks. Add food      coloring to make desired color.    </p>    <p>      If anyone is interested in play dough recipes or fun, safe      activities for kids, you can E-mail me.    </p>    <p>      -Selena Simonoff<br />      simonf@soonet.ca    </p>        <p><strong>Milk Jug Fly Trap</strong></p>    <p>      Trap flies and bees without pesticides by using recycled      materials to create a lure. You'll need three plastic milk      jugs or similar containers. Using sharp scissors, cut the      handles off two jugs. You'll have an elbow-shaped tube; cut      the long leg of each tube diagonally into a slant so you      can place the tubes. Using a utility knife, cut one      vertical slit on each of two sides of the jug, about      two-thirds of the way up. Make the slits just large enough      to accommodate the tubes. Cut a horizontal line through the      center of the vertical slits. Take the long leg of the      tubes with the elbows pointed up and force them part way      into these openings.    </p>    <p>      Bait the trap with sugary juice, filling about one-third of      the jug. Add a protein bait-cooked egg, chicken      bones, or meat-into the inner portion of the tube.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to replace the cap on the jug and place it in an      area where the pests have been congregating. Hang the jug      up by the handle to keep out of reach of children. Yellow      jackets enter the trap, but their natural instincts cause      them to fly up. The tube structure is too difficult for      them to maneuver, and they quickly drown in the juice at      the bottom of the jug.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Amy Fiorilla</em><br />      Milltown, NJ    </p>        <p><strong>Beachcomber's Compost</strong></p>    <p>      The next time you head out to the beach, bring one      recyclable trash bag to clean up after yourself and another      to collect goodies for your compost heap. Seaweed is one of      the best additives I can think of to boost the slow simmer      of a heap, not to mention a mineral boost to the black gold      you'll be harvesting. The broken bits of crab shell you      almost always come across can be crushed and added to the      heap as well.    </p>    <p>      - <em>S. A. Daynard</em><br />      Hudson, NH    </p>    <p>      <strong>Snaky Scarecrow</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the simplest methods I've found in keeping small      garden "thieves" from sampling my vegetables is to lay a      few segments of an old garden hose (six to eight inches      long) here and there among the beds. If you feel like being      creative and have the time, you could paint a few stripes      on them. The animals apparently mistake the hose for snakes      and stay clear. I've always had great luck with this and      end up each season with more than enough vegetables to      share with my good friends and neighbors.    </p>    <p>      - <em>S. A. Lennon</em><br />      Tewksbury, MA    </p>    <p>      <strong>Exploding Fire Ants</strong>    </p>    <p>      I just thought you'd love to know how we get rid of some of      the most pesky insects known to man, but first let me say      that I love your "Country Lore" section and I feel that it      gives many people inexpensive, down-to-earth solutions.      Here's mine. During the summer, fire ants huddle up around      the porch and cause a general nuisance. Well, down here on      Tobacco Road, we just sprinkle a handful of grits around      the densely populated ant holes or areas where ants are the      most troublesome in our yard. The grits expand in their      stomachs, and soon they ...well...explode. I know it sounds      barbaric, but it works.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Alice Davis</em><br />      Goldsboro, NC    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bright Yellow Clothespins</strong>    </p>    <p>      I use a good clothesline to dry my clothes. Out here in the      country, though, it can be difficult to find clothespins      that drop onto the vegetation underneath my clothesline. I      use the one-piece wooden ones. (They're strongest.) They      blend right into the vegetation. I solved that problem      years ago by spray painting them bright yellow.    </p>    <p>      - <em>Joseph Kaye</em><br />      Phenix, VA    </p>    <p>      <strong>Lemon Skunk-Odor Remover</strong>    </p>    <p>      To get skunk odor out of clothes, wash clothes in the      washing machine with laundry detergent and a large bottle      of lemon juice.    </p>    <p>      To keep new clothes from fading so quickly, wash them in      the washing machine with laundry detergent and salt.    </p>    <p>      <em>-JoAnn Lawson</em><br />      Upper Sandusky, OH    </p>
