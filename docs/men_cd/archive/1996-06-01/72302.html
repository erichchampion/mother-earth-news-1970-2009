                <p>      <strong>Home Remedies</strong>    </p>		    <p>Sweet Annies Herb Store.</p>		<h5 id="byline">By Frank Greco</h5>   		<p>      Women stand mixing dried roots, barks, berries, and flowers      in washtub-sized crates, their dust masks caked with herb      dust, bags crunching as they pour more ingredients into the      crates and restock. Whatever the season, Sweet Annie's Herb      Store smells of drying plants, reminiscent of fall.    </p>        <p>      Once a mere hobby, growing, preparing, and storing herbal      medicines has become a booming business for Ann Marie      Wishard. She turned a sizable profit in her second year of      selling herbs, and every year it got better. A two-woman      operation in 1976, the herb store now employs 15. More than      half her business is mail-order, though plenty of curious      people stop by to browse at Sweet Annie's and to see the      store's proprietor.    </p>    <p>      A middle-aged, fairly tall woman with dark hair and eyes      and a penchant for black clothing and digging around in the      dirt, Ann Marie Wishard is used to being considered an      oddity.    </p>    <p>      "Everyone calls me a witch," she says. "You must have heard      I was a witch from someone. Any time a woman uses her gift      to heal another person, is seen dig ging in the dirt, or      collecting herbs, people immediately think that she's a      witch."    </p>    <p>      Although she doesn't in fact practice witchcraft, she does      believe that if people take responsibility for the health      of their minds and bodies, there are few things that cannot      be alleviated by herbal medica tions. "Herbs and modern      medicines can be combined with very few side effects to the      patient when compared to modern medicines alone."    </p>    <p>      "And <em>preventative</em> medicine is the way of the      future," she adds from her office at Sweet Annie's, where      hanging and potted plants absorb each available ray of      sunlight. Drying flowers swing from the ceiling, and a cup      of herbal tea steams next to the computer on her desk. One      of her well-behaved muts lounges on the hardwood floor next      to the piles of papers and books she referred to while      writing her now completed book, <em>Herb Talk</em> (Sweet      Annie's Herbs, Inc., 1995).    </p>        <p>      It all began-the book, and the now booming home      business-some time ago when Ann Marie lived in      Tussyville, Pennsylvania. Wild plants surrounded her farm      house and she began reading all she could about      them-from their nutritional value to their vitamin      content and healing properties. She remembers looking out a      window into the meadow and thinking to herself, "We will      never go hungry here" But when the weeds in the pastures      began to appear on the dinner table, company became scarce.    </p>    <p>      In 1976, Ann realized that her fascination with herbs was      so all-encompassing that making it her business seemed the      logical next step. The world wasn't quite ready for the      herb business, though. With an initial investment of $100      between her and her sister, they opened the garage door to      their new herb store, and posted the name on an old piece      of wood: "Tussyville Trading Post and Herb Farm."    </p>    <p>      "I was surprised at people's reaction to the store," Ann      says. "They were scared to drink the teas I had made." The      first year their gross income was a very modest $1,200.      Over the next few years, though, word got around and      curiosity brought more and more visitors to the store. By      the third year, they grossed $45,000. The business was fun      for her, but always just an elaborate excuse to go around      "digging in the dirt and running amok."    </p>        <p>      Business reached a peak in the late 70s and has held fairly      steady. Since then, Ann has moved to Centre Hall,      Pennsylvania, where she kept the simple lifestyle and the      store but changed its name to Sweet Annie's Herbs. "Some      people think that I am calling myself sweet," Ann says,      "but really the name came from an herb that we planted the      first year. It's taking over the town; people just don't      know it yet." And it is. When people mow their lawns, there      is no longer a freshcut-grass smell but something more like      parfume de camphor-the pervasive aroma of Sweet      Annie.    </p>    <p>      It's hard to make a living at this business, but I love it.      Nothing but the love of herbs and people would keep me in      this:" The business used to keep track of mail-order      customers on card files, but with a current active      mail-order list of over 14,000 people, they were forced to      use computers. "I hate to change," Ann said. "If it wasn't      for my son, I wouldn't have spent so much on a 1-800 line      and these computers. I wanted to keep my card files and my      little black rotary phone:"    </p>    <p>      She believes radio shows have given her the edge she needed      to get the business going, particularly the mail-order      business. "It's the best advertising I have ever      experienced," she says. "We used to have one or two a week,      but sometimes now we are doing five or six, and all over      the United States as well as Canada:"    </p>        <p>      People call up and ask questions, while Ann gives advice.      "When I say that red clover does something, every store in      the range of broadcast sells out of it. I have even had      people tell me that they have pulled their cars to the side      of the road while listening to me on the radio and begin to      write down what I was saying on the show."    </p>    <p>      Here are a few of Ann's favorite herbs, their uses, and      some methods for storing and preparing them. The uses of      herbs are plentiful and varied. Some plants have many      healing properties and Ann has covered many of them in her      detailed books, including discussions of their recommended      dosages. The following herbs and their uses can also be      found in <em>Herb Talk.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Annie's Storage and Preparation Tips</strong>    </p>    <p>      Drying has the virtue of being not only the most common      method of storing herbs but also the easiest. Once they are      completely dried, you can store them in a container,      preferably an airtight one, for up to one year. Some herbs      store better than others, but most can be safely stored      dry. When drying herbs, you should keep them out of the      sunlight, as this has a tendency to deplete their medicinal      value. Keep them free of d ust and dirt as well.    </p>        <p>      Tinctures and extracts are another way of storing herbs.      They have an almost indefinite shelf life, mostly because      of the alcohol. Start by putting the herb in some brandy      and placing it in a warm place for about three weeks. Once      that is completed you can stop there or give the mixture a      higher medicinal value by removing the original herb from      the brandy and replacing it with fresh. This can be      repeated as many times as you wish, and each time the      medicinal value of the tincture strengthens. You can do      this with witch hazel or vinegar as well, and the herbs can      be dried or fresh, though dried herbs allow you to place a      larger quantity in at one time.    </p>    <p>      Salves are useful for external applications and you can      make them from lard, glycerin, or just about any oil,      including olive. Simply add the herbs to the base and warm      it for an hour or so, allowing the oils in the plant to be      released into the base. Once the extraction is completed,      just add bee's wax to solidify the mixture and store in a      cool place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Summer savory,</strong> a common garden herb and      sometimes weed, has many times proven its worth to the tea      cabinet. Ann recommends three to four cups a day to help      decrease the blood cholesterol level.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Red clover</strong> is one of Ann's favorite herbs.      Red clover is good for any ailment that would benefit from      purifying the blood, and is one of the main ingredients in      Sweet Annie's Herb Store's Cancer Therapy Tea. Ann says      some of her customers who are cancer patients drink three      cups of red clover tea every day to help purify their      blood, and have discovered that the clover may also be      helpful in counteracting the nausea that usually      accompanies chemotherapy treatment.    </p>        <p>      Mullein is used for respiratory ailments. Placing an      infusion of mullein leaves in a vaporizer can provide      children and adults temporary relief of their coughing and      wheezing. Coltsfoot tea can also relieve some respiratory      complaints.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Berry</strong> leaves are especially useful herbs.      Blueberry leaves regulate blood sugar and can be beneficial      for those with fluctuating blood sugar. Ann says raspberry      leaves are great for pregnant women in their last      trimester, and are also useful for ailments related to      mucous membranes, including sore throats. Blackberry leaves      are also effective for soothing the intestines during a      bout of diarrhea.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Plantain</strong> has been used in poultices      (mashed up) to soothe boils and other skin irritations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Alfalfa</strong> , a common crop to many farm ers,      when taken as a tea, is cleansing of the liver and is      beneficial when used for such problems as allergies,      diabetes, and arthritis.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Anise seed</strong> and the herb Queen Anne's lace      provide relief from gas and digestive problems.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Burdock</strong> root is one of the most annoy ing      herbs to pet owners. The burs always seem to find a way      onto livestock and pets, but the root of the plant is one      of nature's own most powerful blood purifiers aside from      red clover. It stabilizes normal body functions and aids in      the urinary tract and prostate roles.    </p>        <p>      Catnip and white willow have similar qualities. They calm      and relax, relieve headaches, and can also relieve fever      and upset stomach.<br />      <br />      Something to keep in mind when collecting these and other      herbs on your own is that many of them have similar      physical characteristics to other separate and similar      species which may be potentially toxic. <em>Be sure of the      herb you are collecting</em> and never harvest more than      you may need. Also, you may want to leave a few plants      remaining after your harvest to ensure future crops.    </p>    <p>      A bit of judiciously selected herbs slipped into your      morning's tea may seem like too modest a step toward better      health, but the fact is that many ailments that are      considered unavoidable, such as stomachaches and headaches,      can be effectively treated and/or prevented with herbal      medications. Herbs are best regarded not as magical cures      but rather as natural tools, as old as civilization itself,      which help our systems work more efficiently.    </p>    <p>      When taking herbs as supplements or medication, be sure to      consult your physician before changing your regular regime.      After that, a trip to the library will yield not only field      guides to help in herb identification but also brochures      from the local agricultural extension service to help in      growing and harvest.    </p>    <p>      To request a catalog from Sweet Annie's Herb Store call      (800) 995-HERB.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dr. Dickson's Herbal Foot Care</strong>    </p>    <p>      The pharmacies are littered with 'em. Foot powders and      athlete's foot treatments and ointments and creams and      sprays ...all very attractive but expensive avenues towards      healthier feet. Those readers who have become familiar with      my herbal remedies won't be surprised when I suggest that      there are natural treatments capable of replacing virtually      all of the tubes and canisters lining your medicine      cabinet. Here goes.    </p>    <p>      Let's start with just plain tired feet. You can start by      placing some cayenne pepper inside your socks prior to      putting them on your feet. Cayenne can be purchased in the      spice department of most grocery stores where it is      sometimes called red or hot pepper. The botanical name for      it is capsicum and it forms the basis of numerous      prescription ointments. In pharmaceutical terms, cayenne      acts as a rubefacient (stimulates blood circulation) and      draws blood toward the surface of the skin. This results in      your feet simply feeling much less tired. Be careful,      however, when using it so you do not get it near your mouth      or eyes.    </p>    <p>      Once you get home, you can make a terrific foot bath by      pouring one quart of boiling water over 5 handfuls of      silver birch bark and steeping for 20 minutes. Strain off      the bark and pour into a container large enough to      accommodate both feet. You should begin to experience      immediate relief. An optional bath remedy can be made by      placing a cup each of mint, lavender, and calendula leaves      in a pan of boiling water. As soon as it has cooled down      sufficiently you are ready to soak your feet. The lavender      not only helps to make for an effective remedy but also      adds a very soothing fragrance in the bargain.    </p>    <p>      Victims of foot odor are usually the brunt of jokes, unless      you happen to live with a few. Proximity tends to make foot      odor measurably less funny, and there's something you can      do about it without spending $10 on charcoal shoe inserts.      Just soak your feet in a hot pan of water to which has been      added some baking soda and vinegar. Of course, you will      want to put on some socks and shoes once you have dried      your feet so no one will accuse you of smelling like      granny's kitchen during pickle season. This remedy is      effective because foot odors are the result of simple      bacteria accumulating on the surface of the skin. These      bacteria are put out of their misery in short order by the      baking soda-vinegar combination.    </p>    <p>      Finally, for those miserable little corns that can quickly      take the dance out of your step, don't forget our old      friend the onion. While a large slice of fresh onion can do      wonders to enhance the taste of a hamburger, it also has      numerous medicinal qualities, one of which is in the      treatment of corns. Place a slice of raw onion over the      corn each night, bandage, and tape. In about two weeks it      should be gone. - <em>Dr.</em> Charles <em>Dickson,      Ph.D.</em>    </p>
