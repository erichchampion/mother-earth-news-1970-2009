                <h3>      BITS & PIECES</h3>         <p>      <strong>A new haven for<br />      endangered species</strong>    </p>    <p>      Yeah, yeah ...everybody <em>talks</em> about helping      endangered species, but it seems like today's plans are      nothing but unrealistic pipedreams. How about taking a      piece of land and devoting it entirely to the preservation      and breeding of endangered species?    </p>        <p>      Consider it done. And consider it a gift - a $2.7      million gift. The Ohio Power Company and American Electric      Power presented 9,154 acres of beautifully reclaimed      strip-mine land to "The Wilds," an international,      non-profit membership organization which is committed to      preserving natural diversity. The Wilds happily accepted      the land and converted it into the largest wild-animal      complex in North America. Quite a gift.    </p>    <p>      Apparently, there's quite a guest-list as well: the North      American red wolf, who used to be popular until humans      moved in and destroyed much of their South Eastern habitat;      the African Hartmann Mountain zebra, the rarest species of      zebra, is attending as well. Just 25 years ago, 100,000 of      these zebras were running around - now there are      6000.    </p>    <p>      The Asian Wild Horse always makes for interesting      conversation, as it is the animal most closely associated      with the caveman of Central Europe and Asia (from more than      25,000 years ago). In 1945, there were 31 left in the      world. However, a zoological association stepped in and      bred the horses, increasing the number to 800. Sadly, the      lists of invites to The Wilds continues to grow.    </p>    <p>      Among the many sponsors of The Wilds is Bonnie Belle, a      leading cosmetic and skin-care-products manufacturer. If      this company goes ahead with their future campaign plan,      you'll be able to see photos of the reservation in upcoming      ads. In the meantime, you can find out more information by      calling the The Wilds administrative office (614/228-0402)      or the reservation itself (614/638-5030).    </p>    <h3>Milking to Country Moosic</h3>          <p>      If you're having trouble getting your cow to produce enough      milk, throw a little Garth Brooks or Willie Nelson in your      tape player. You'll be dancing with glee, and so will your      cow.    </p>    <p>      At least that's what Bethany Welch says. As <em>USA      Today</em> reports, this high-school sophomore from      Ashland, Ohio, is one of 750 students from around the world      who have entered the 43rd International Science fair in      Nashville, Tennessee. Her experiment was to determine how      music affected cows' milking over an eight-week time      period.    </p>    <p>      Her results are now in: Not only did music boost the milk      output of the 160 cows on her family farm - but the      type of music actually determined how <em>much</em> more      milk was produced.    </p>    <p>      It seems that cows were suckers for a good country tune,      which increased their milk output by a whopping 6.2%.      Apparently, the cows also loved stomping their hooves to      good of rock 'n' roll, as milk production with this      background music increased by 4.7%. As for classical music,      well, it seems that cows could pretty much take or leave      Vivaldi or Beethoven, as proven by the small 1.6% increase.    </p>    <p>      You're probably wondering about your favorite brand of      music, whether it be opera, folk music, or show tunes. Why      not go ahead and try them all out? (If you're a classical      music buff, don't give up so soon - try a little      Moozart.) Udder than that, you're on your own, so have a      little fun doing your own experiments. If all else fails,      remember: if you produce the country tunes, your cow will      produce the milk.    </p>		<h3>The Real-live Giving Tree</h3>    <p>      Imagine if there was something all-natural that could solve      all our problems - something like a tree? Some      scientists say the Neem - an Indian tree of tropical      species - is the cure-all we're looking for. What      does it do? Well, according to the <em>Washington      Post's</em> article on the Neem, the real question is      - what doesn't it do?    </p>        <p>      It's a reforestation technique. The Neem tree grows      comparatively fast (it hits about 30 feet high in six      years!), and thrives best on worn-out crop land. It      actually does it's quickest growing on poor soil in the      semi-arid lands of Africa and Arabia.    </p>    <p>      It's a pesticide. The extracts of the Neem's seeds and      leaves contain pesticides which attack those pesky insects      chowing on your plants. The extracts kill over 200 species      of insects, but won't harm birds, mammals, or insects which      don't eat plants. However, there are those who consider      this pesticide to be cruel and unusual, as it can take up      to two weeks to kill the insects.    </p>    <p>      It's a toothpaste. (It'll clean those nasty little bugs      right off your teeth!) Scientists claim that millions of      Indian folks only "brush" their teeth with a frayed Neem      twig. Soon after, German researchers caught on to this      potential marketing product, and after several studies,      confirmed that there are indeed substances in the Neem      which prevent tooth decay.    </p>    <p>      It's a contraception. (What?) But it's no joke. There is      evidence that the Neem's oil, when pressed from the seed,      acts as a strong spermicide. Researchers are now trying to      use one of the Neem's compounds to create a male birth      control pill.    </p>    <p>      We know - now you want at least 10 Neem trees to      plant in your own backyard. Unfortunately, there are only      two Neems in America (both of them alive and doing well in      Florida). But don't worry, you'll be hearing more about      this "miracle" tree. There's a lot more research going on,      and field cultivation is being done in Oklahoma, southern      California, and Arizona. And, of course, plenty of skeptics      are keeping the Neem discussion alive. So keep your ears      and your backyard open.    </p>    <h3>Baby-Boomer Gardening Flourishes</h3>      <p>      Get this: According to the <em>Wall Street journal,</em>      gardening has become a favorite yuppie time-passer. How      very E.C. (environmentally correct).    </p>    <p>      For one thing, culinary herb sales are growing like crazy.      And the more exotic, the better - carrots and lettuce      are out; radiccio, Bok choy, and arugula are in. The beauty      of yuppie gardening is that it's no-fail - gardeners      simply use bedding plants instead of seedlings. Most      importantly, it's non-messy! (You really expect board      members to enter into their important meetings with soil      under their fingernails?)    </p>    <p>      To further alleviate potential mess, yuppie gardeners have      taken to fashionable "gardening apparel." Let's see, there      are sporty pants with insertable knee pads, pants with      tool-holding pockets, and plastic clogs to keep tender      yuppie feet dirt-free.    </p>    <p>      Leave it to those nutty baby boomers to turn gardening into      an expensive, competitive hobby. But don't worry, the trend      will surely pass, and yuppies will find a brand new hobby      to invest all their money in...    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Do you have any interesting, timely, or      even peculiar news items you would like to share with      other</em> <em>MOTHER</em> <em>readers?
