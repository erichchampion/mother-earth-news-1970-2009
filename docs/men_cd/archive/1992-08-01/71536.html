                    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne Vassal    </h5>    <p>      <strong>Add a little variety and spice to your summer      salads.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Most of us eagerly welcome the long-awaited salad season,      when a fresh, crisp salad is the most satisfying summer day      meal. Now you don't have to be a salad lover to appreciate      the variety of colors, textures, and flavors of a summer      salad. It can be something as simple as homegrown, sliced      tomatoes on tender bibb lettuce with a few chopped chives.      A light vinaigrette drizzled sparingly over the top is a      nice touch but not a necessity considering how many      flavorful lettuces are available. A summer salad can even      become the main course, unless you have a family like mine      which asks, "Where's the beef?" So I throw some chicken or      fish on the grill and serve that too.    </p>    <p>      If you've been trying to lose a few pounds, this is the      season. Fruits and vegetables have a high-nutrient density,      which means that for the number of calories they supply,      most contain a disproportionately large amount of essential      vitamins. An average head of romaine or leaf lettuce      contains only 15 calories while high in vitamin A, calcium,      and potassium. Because fruits and vegetables are filled      with water and fiber, they leave you feeling nice and full.    </p>    <h3>      Lighten up your Dressing    </h3>    <p>      So why aren't all the salad eaters as skinny as bean poles?      Too often, the most nutritious and low-Fully prepared, we      cast our lines into the water and sat calmly, like Jonah,      and waited for our whale.calorie salad is ruined by a fatty      dressing. Just two tablespoons of bottled dressing or      mayonnaise can increase a salad's calorie value by 150      calories or more. Sure there are lowfat bottled dressings      now, but they are often high in sodium and contain      additives. These salad dressings were created for the      tasteless and nutrition-less iceberg lettuce that sit      around in the grocery store for weeks. Homemade dressings,      on the other hand, are a simple and economical alternative      to expensive bottled dressings. The "Basic Salad Dressing"      (see recipe below) does contain some oil, but I've chosen      olive oil and canola oil because they're monounsaturated      oils which are great for cholesterol watchers. (Canola oil      is also the lowest in saturated fat.) If you are watching      your fat intake, add more lemon juice and less oil; use      dressing sparingly.    </p>    <p>      Included here are some healthy versions of old favorites.      Instead of using mayonnaise for coleslaw and potato salad,      there's an alternative dressing. If you prefer to use      mayonnaise, buy the "light" variety at a health food store,      and use half mayonnaise and half low-fat yogurt in your      recipe. All the recipes are kept simple because I'm sure      you'd rather be swimming, golfing, boating than cooking.    </p>    <h3>      Salad Assembly    </h3>    <p>      Choose a variety of light and dark green lettuces (the      darker contain the most nutrients). Some possibilities      include: romaine, leaf, bibb, boston, buttercrunch,      radicchio, endive, spinach, and kale. Our favorite is      arugula, which is sturdy and grows until well into October.    </p>    <p>      Wash the lettuce in a colander and shake out the excess      water. Wrap in a dishtowel (not terrycloth) and refrigerate      for a few hours. If refrigerating overnight, put the whole      dishtowel bundle in a plastic bag.    </p>    <h3>      Dressing Your Salad    </h3>    <p>      Summer salad dressing needs to be light and tasty without      overpowering the delicate and flavorful garden lettuces.      Use a quality red wine vinegar such as "Great Impressions"      or "Spice Island" which can be found at most supermarkets.      I use a light-tasting olive oil, preferably an Italian oil.      For flavor, add canola oil which is tasteless. For a      sliced, tomato salad, you may want to use only olive oil      with two tablespoons or so of extra-virgin olive oil for a      stronger olive taste.    </p>        <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Greek Village Salad      </h3>      <p>        This type of salad is served in one of our favorite        restaurants in Chicago's Greektown. Calamata (Greek)        olives and feta cheese can usually be found at the deli        counter in large supermarkets. If you have a choice,        imported Greek feta cheese is better tasting than        domestic. It's less salty and made with goat's milk.        Yugoslavian feta is very goaty tasting and French feta        (if you can find it) is the best I've ever tasted. Store        the feta in a covered plastic container submerged in        water. My husband's Greek father always stored feta in        milk, which drew out some of the salt. If you do try the        milk method, empty the milk out after two or three days.      </p>      <p>        <em>4 or 5 tomatoes, cut into wedges<br />        1 cucumber, cut in half or lengthwise<br />        - and thinly sliced<br />        1 green pepper, thinly sliced<br />        1 small red onion, cut in half<br />        - and thinly sliced<br />        10 to 15 Calamata (Greek) or canned,<br />        - black olives (use whole or pit<br />        - and cut into halves.<br />        1/3 to 1/2 lb. Feta cheese,<br />        - cut into small cubes<br />        freshly ground pepper to taste<br />        2 tablespoons chopped parsley<br />        1/2 to 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br />        - or any other crisp variety to taste</em>      </p>      <p>        Put the washed and torn lettuce on a platter or in a        bowl. Arrange the rest of the ingredients on top.        Sprinkle with oregano and parsley. Drizzle "Greek        Dressing" on top, and then toss lightly just before        serving.      </p>      <h3>        Cucumber Salad      </h3>      <p>        Cucumber salad can be prepared ahead of time if you mix        in the dressing just before serving so it doesn't get too        watery.      </p>      <p>        <em>4 to 5 cucumbers, thinly sliced,<br />        - peeled if you prefer<br />        1 small red onion, halved<br />        - and thinly sliced<br />        4 green onions, sliced into thin circles<br />        - 1/2 cup chopped chives</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>DRESSING:</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>1 cup yogurt, low-fat or nonfat<br />        salt, ground pepper, and<br />        - cayenne pepper to taste<br />        1/2 teaspoon ground cumins</em>      </p>      <p>        Combine salad ingredients in a large bowl. Then prepare        dressing and mix so that vegetalbes are well-coated.      </p>      <h3>        Green Bean-Garbanzo Salad      </h3>      <p>        <em>4 cups green beans<br />        1 can garbanzo beans (chick peas)<br />        - rinsed in cold water<br />        1 red onion, cut in half<br />        - and thinly sliced<br />        3 tablespoons fresh dill chopped, or 1 - tablespoon        dried dill<br />        1/2 cup chopped parsley<br />        1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />        salt and/or freshly ground pepper<br />        2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br />        3 tablespoons olive oil<br />        1 teaspoon dijon mustard<br />        2 large cloves garlic, minced</em> <em><br /></em>      </p>      <p>        Steam the green beans until they're almost done but still        firm. They'll continue to cook as they sit. Put the beans        in the freezer for five minutes to chill. Then mix the        garbanzos, onion, parsley, and dill. Separately mix the        dressing in the blender or with a whisk and stir into the        salad. Serve immediately or chill until mealtime.      </p>      <h3>        Mozzarella-Tomato Salad      </h3>      <p>        I use homemade mozzarella cheese that I buy at an Italian        deli for this salad. It comes shaped into small balls        which are stored in water. If this cheese is unavailable,        use a part-skim mozzarella or provolone cheese.      </p>      <p>        <em>3 to 4 ripe homegrown tomatoes,<br />        - sliced<br />        2 balls of mozzarella sliced in 1/2"<br />        - circles or regular mozzarella,<br />        - cut into strips<br />        chopped chives or green onion<br />        6 to 8 fresh basil leaves, torn into<br />        - pieces garden lettuce leaves (such as bibb)<br />        Basil dressing</em>      </p>      <p>        Arrange the lettuce in a platter or individual plates.        Place the cheese and tomatoes on the lettuce. Top with        chives and basil; drizzle with dressing.      </p>      <div class="image">        <img src="../images/133-54-i2.jpg" alt=" 133-54-i2.jpg" width="256" height="257" />      </div>      <div class="sidebar">        <h3>          Fruit Salad        </h3>        <p>          <em>1/2 melon, musk, honeydew,<br />          - cantaloupe or watermelon<br />          grapes, seedless or green<br />          4 to 5 peaches or nectarines<br />          1 lime<br />          a few sprigs of fresh mint</em>        </p>        <p>          Cut up the melon in bite-size cubes and the peaches          into slices. Squeeze lime juice on the fruit. Stir, and          top with mint. Refrigerate for up to four hours before          serving.        </p>        <h3>          Red Bean Coleslaw        </h3>        <p>          <em>2 cups thinly sliced green cabbage<br />          2 cups thinly sliced red cabbage<br />          1 green or yellow bell pepper, chopped<br />          1/2 onion, chopped<br />          1 (1 ounce) can red beans<br />          1/4 cup low-fat sour cream<br />          2 tablespoons spicy vegetable juice (V-8)<br />          1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />          1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br />          2 tablespoons lime juice<br />          3/4 cup chopped cilantro (or parsley)</em>        </p>        <p>          Mix the cabbage, pepper, onion, beans, and cilantro in          a large bowl. Whisk the dressing in a separate bowl and          stir into the cabbage mixture. Refrigerate up to two          hours before serving or serve immediately. If the slaw          sits too long, it will start to get soggy.        </p>        <h3>          Potato Salad Dressing        </h3>        <p>          <em>1/3 cup low-fat or non-fat yogurt<br />          2/3 cup low-fat cottage cheese<br />          1 tablespoon white-wine vinegar<br />          1 tablespoon honey<br />          dash of cayenne pepper and salt<br />          freshly ground pepper<br />          1 tablespoon fresh dill (optional) or 1<br />          - teaspoon dried dill</em>        </p>        <p>          Put all ingredients into a blender and blend until          smooth.        </p>        <h3>          Tabouli (Bulgur* Salad)        </h3>        <p>          This salad is best when homegrown tomatoes are in          season. You can use plum or cherry tomatoes also. If          you prefer cherry tomatoes, cut them in halves and add          them to the salad just before serving. Like regular          tomatoes, they don't refrigerate well.        </p>        <p>          <em>2 cups bulgar (fine to medium ground)<br />          1 1/4 cups water<br />          4 tomatoes, diced<br />          5 to 6 green onions, finely chopped<br />          1/2 cup fresh mint, finely chopped, or<br />          - 1 tablespoon dried mint<br />          1 cup chopped fresh parsley<br />          - (not Italian parsley)<br />          1/3 cup olive oil<br />          1/3 cup lemon juice<br />          salt and freshly ground pepper<br />          1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />          pinch of cumin powder</em>        </p>        <p>          Put the bulgur in a large bowl. Pour the boiling water          over it and let stand for one hour. Add the rest of the          ingredients. Add the tomatoes just before serving.        </p>        <p>          *Bulgur can be purchased at a mideastern market or a          health food store.
