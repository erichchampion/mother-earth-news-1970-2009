                  <p><strong>      BOURNE STRIKES OUT</strong></p>			      <h5 id="byline">        BY JOEL BOURNE      </h5>           <p>      <strong>Sluggish, scum-sucking bottom-feeders or wily,      powerful channel cats?</strong>    </p>    		            <p>      "Come on down to the Chowan," he said. "We'll catch one      that'll go 20, heck, maybe 40 pounds." Phil Livesay, a      longtime fishing buddy was singing the siren's song over      the telephone and it was working like a charm. The Chowan      River curls down from Virginia in a wide, tea-colored swath      to empty into North Carolina's Albemarle Sound. It's the      home of our grail, a fish with the whiskers of a walrus and      nearly the same girth: the Chowan River channel cat.    </p>    <p>      Aesthetes in the angling world may disdain the lowly cat as      a dull, sluggish,scum-sucking bottom feeder with a penchant      for putrid meat. Some undoubtedly are. But the wily channel      cat and its big brothers, the blue and flathead, are the      poor man's marlin - fish so agile, so discerning, so      powerful, and sometimes just so darned big that they leave      other freshwater fish floundering in their wake. The big      catfish can grow up to five feet long and weigh more than      130 pounds. One of the most accessible game fish, catfish      are the largest family of freshwater fishes endemic to      North America, with some 40 species found in the US and      Canada. More than 2,200 catfish species haunt rivers and      lakes worldwide. And in the frying pan, where the caviar is      separated from the fish eggs so to speak, the mild flesh of      the channel cat will beat the pants off of a marlin every      time.    </p>    <p>      A few days after our telephone conversation, we were      skimming over a light Chowan chop in Phil's 16-foot skiff      just off of Perry's Beach, a small clutter of cottages near      the hamlet of Colerain, North Carolina. "Most people think      that the best way to catch a catfish is to use rancid meat,      cat food, or some other stink bait," Phil yelled over the      whine of the old Chrysler outboard. "But I've always had      the best luck with fresh bait - worms and minnows."      The day before, he and his wife Renee had gone worming      along a nearby ditch bank, turning over the damp, soft loam      with a shovel until they had half-filled a coffee can with      red wigglers and soil. Renee, who is smaller than the      biggest catfish, but every bit as feisty, has had catfish      fever for more than a year now, ever since she hooked a      15-pound channel cat on a six-pound test line and fought it      skillfully for 45 minutes before landing it. "When I hooked      that fish I thought I had snagged the bottom," Renee says,      a wistful look in her eye. "Then the bottom started to      move."    </p>    <p>      Renee sat in the bow of the boat, her dark curls blowing in      the light southwesterly breeze as we headed for a small      creek mouth to seine for minnows. We found them in the      shallows, sardine-sized slivers of flickering light.      Catfish are really connoisseurs, Phil explained. They love      small herring fry that swarm through the shallows in late      spring and early summer. But herring don't live long in      captivity, which reduces their value as bait. His second      preference are common river minnows, or shiners, which are      just as abundant as catfish. After four sweeps with the      20-foot seine, we had about three dozen minnows swimming      contentedly in a five-gallon bucket.    </p>    <p>      Phil has been fishing this part of the Chowan since before      he could cast a cane pole, and the river's nooks and      crannies are imbedded in his memory. On the western shore,      steep, clay bluffs drop to the water's edge, where they      give way to sandbars and deep channels. Here the cats often      doze in the daytime. On the eastern shore, nearly a mile      away, is a flooded cypress forest whose knees and roots      provide shelter for a variety of small bait fish. Here the      big fish prowl the shallows, hunting minnows like their      feline counterparts stalk songbirds. Phil decided to try      the cypress first.    </p>    <p>      My first catfish tackle as a boy was a stout cane pole, a      hook that seemed as thick as a ten-penny nail, and a line      strong enough to haul up the transatlantic cable. Today's      gear is more refined but just as simple. We rigged up three      light spinning rods with a quarter-ounce sinker and two      number six hooks tied about a foot apart, beginning a foot      from the lead. For an added attraction, Phil added a tiny      silver spoon near the sinker and finished it off by      clipping a round, red and white bobber to the line in order      to keep the bait just off of the bottom.    </p>    <p>      I threaded a worm on one hook and a minnow on the other,      piercing the small fish through the back near its dorsal. I      tossed it near a cypress where I could see the bobber and      made myself comfortable in the bottom of the boat.      Catfishing, unlike other forms of angling, gives one cause      for contemplation. There are no noisy stickbaits to      retrieve, no plastic worms to wiggle, no backlashes to pick      out. There's just the sky, the world, and a bobber full of      possibilities.    </p>    <p>      - <strong>whereupon Renee<br />      confessed that they had<br />      recently spent an evening<br />      watching the latest catfishing<br />      video.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Renee sat in a deck chair in the bow, Phil was draped      across the captain's chair in the stern, and I stretched      out in the middle. The sun warmed our hides as we watched      an osprey wheel on the currents overhead, bent on a      similar, if more active mission. The talk turned from      politics, to inlaws, to whether worms actually feel the      hook, to art - whereupon Renee confessed that they      had recently spent an evening watching the latest      catfishing video. The conversation went something like      this:    </p>    <p>      Me: "You watched a what?"    </p>    <p>      Renee: "A catfishing video. We got it just for laughs, but      halfway through, Phil started taking notes.    </p>    <p>      Phil: "Did not."    </p>    <p>      Renee: "You did so. Then he called over my sister and      brother-in-law and made them watch it."    </p>    <p>      Me: "How was it?"    </p>    <p>      Renee: "Not as bad as you'd think. The star was this big      hairy guy named Creature, or was it Frog? Toad. It was      definitely Toad. When he squatted down he had plenty of      rear cleavage."    </p>    <p>      Me: "Excuse me?"    </p>    <p>      Phil: "Renee - "    </p>    <p>      Renee: "You know, between his shirt-tail and his pants.      Rear cleavage."    </p>        <p>      According to the hairy Toad, Renee said, the first major      rule of catfishing is that at least one person in the party      had to have a nickname. Phil immediately christened her      "Sweetpea." The words had scarcely left his lips when,      Renee's bobber dove for the bottom. She jerked the rod up,      carving a question mark in the air, and soon a fat bream      with its iridescent reds, yellow, and greens lay thumping      in the bottom of the boat.    </p>    <p>      The fish proved another fundamental law of fishing:      whenever men cast lines with women, women always catch the      first fish.    </p>    <p>      After the initial excitement, the action, tapered off in      the rising midday heat. We tried a a few other spots among      the cypresses, and then cruised back to Perry's Beach for a      lunch of thick ham sandwiches and beer. Sitting on Phil's      mother's porch, we discussed the afternoon strategy. He      said the video recommended fishing the hole, the run, and      the riffle (a sign that he was at least paying attention).      That morning he'd hoped to catch the fish moving into the      shallows around the cypresses to feed, but in the afternoon      he wanted to try a few deep holes and channels where they      sometimes rested during the day. Even when not actively      hunting, catfish are opportunistic feeders and often can't      resist a morsel dangling right in front of their whiskers.    </p>    <p>      After lunch we headed upriver past a number of pound nets,      the maze-like sets of stakes and nets that lead migrating      herring into a net impoundment or "pound." Phil says he has      seen the pounds turn silver with the small, oily fish while      ospreys dove into them like sharks in a frenzy. The water      quality of the Chowan has been degraded in the past because      paper mills and fertilizer plants upstream used to dump      dyes and chemical nutrients in the river, spurring massive      algal blooms. The fertilizer plant has since closed and the      paper mill was forced to clean up its act, so the river is      now on the mend. Herring are once again filling the pounds      and more ospreys return to nest every year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fully prepared, we<br />      cast our lines into the<br />      water and sat calmly,<br />      like Jonah, and waited<br />      for our whale.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Phil flipped on the depth finder and found a channel about      25 feet deep. We took the bobbers off and let the baits      drift for a while but we couldn't raise a strike, so we      tried a sandy point where the water depth drops from inches      to 20 feet in a few yards. Somewhere along this underwater      wall of sand we hoped to find our fish. Here we could also      stagger the baits at different depths to give the fish more      options. To give added authority to our angling mission, we      scavenged a few forked sticks and thrust them in the sand      for rod holders. Fully prepared, we cast our lines into the      water and sat calmly, like Jonah, and waited for our whale.    </p>    <p>      It didn't take long. A twitching rod-tip brought my hands      to the reel and I struck like a madman, only to find the      line firmly embedded in what felt like a sunken pickup      truck. I tried to clear it from the snag, to no avail and      was forced to break the rig off. Soon Renee was in the same      fix. Within 30 minutes we lost three rigs, and Phil,      anxious about his tackle supply, suggested a more strategic      venue. We got back in the boat and headed towards the      structure until Phil located it on the depth finder. We      anchored right on top of it.    </p>    <p>      Now there comes a time when the moon and stars align in the      heavens and the water temperature rises to the exact degree      when the structure and the depth and the luck of the angler      combine to make fish ravenously hungry. This was such a      time. Renee immediately hooked a nice white perch, a      delicious, schooling panfish that weighed about a pound.      Phil soon had another one in the stern. As my rod tip began      to jitter, I remember thinking that if we couldn't catch a      monster cat at least we wouldn't go hungry.    </p>    <p>      Then my line started tearing off the spool, accompanied by      the high whine of the little reel's drag. I felt the power      in the rod as it bent toward the water. Out of the corner      of my eye, I saw Phil jump to attention. In the bow I heard      Renee whisper, "Oh, my Lord!" In my mind I envisioned how      the fight would ensue: the long powerful runs to deep      water, the careful chase as Phil cranked the outboard and      followed, the whine of the six-pound monofilament as it      stretched to the breaking point. The photo in the papers.      The glory. The sponsorships from tackle companies. Instead,      the fish made three nice little runs and scrambled to the      surface - a frisky, pound-and-a-half channel cat. He      was the perfect size for eating but a little small for      glory. I grabbed him behind his pectoral and dorsal fins to      avoid the spines on the leading edges and removed the hook      while he grinned like a fat little Frenchman. His smooth,      white and bronze skin was speckled with brown spots and was      as pretty as any trout. I threw him back to grow.    </p>        <p>      Our victory ground turned out to be a white perch palace      and we brought them in with dizzying consistency for about      forty minutes. Renee caught another catfish a few inches      long, spurring hopes that a big one lurked nearby. If it      did, we will never know. Our grail still haunts the murky      bottom, mocking us and waiting patiently for another day.    </p>    <p>      For the folks that chase the cats, the siren's song is as      strong as ever.    </p>
