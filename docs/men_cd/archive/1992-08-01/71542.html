                <p>      <strong>Planning and building your own country      drive</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By John Vivian    </h5>    <p>      Turning into our narrow, 200-year-old, packed-dirt driveway      had always been arm-wrenching. In "mud-time," during each      spring run-off, the drive entry hosted a running stream,      while a periodic spring turned the section beside the house      into a bog large enough to swallow small cars. The      turnaround at the rear of the house had turned into a      swamp. Then, our New England, hill-country road was graded      and paved - making the approach swampier still      - and we decided it was high time to bring the      Colonial-era wagon path up to the automotive-era demands of      modern times. Now our problems and solutions will not be      the same as yours, but the steps we took should help you      build or renew the drive of your own country place.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A driveway is a miniature<br />      road.<br />      Lessons from the pre-mechanized<br />      past may be instructive if you plan<br />      to do some of the work yourself.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Existing driveways should be "grandfathered" so that      surface and interior improvements are exempt from building      code and/or zoning regulations. However, if you are making      a new or substantially enlarged curb-cut onto a public way,      the "setback" from property lines, dimensions and      construction of your drive will require approval from the      town(ship) highway supervisor or engineer. If entering a      State or County road, an additional permit and inspection      are needed. To find out applicable regulations, you can      visit your town clerk. Even if it is not required, a      consultation with the township or county road boss can      provide invaluable help in designing and constructing the      best drive for your soil type, weather, and elevation.      Indeed, you maybe able to hire the municipal crew and      equipment for the heavy work. Keep in mind that rates are      competitive and no one knows how to do the job better.    </p>    <h3>      Learning From the Past    </h3>    <p>      A driveway is a miniature road. Lessons from the      pre-mechanized past may be instructive, especially if you      plan to do some of the work yourself:    </p>    <p>      With the advent of wheeled vehicles, Stone Age footpaths      became rutted, swampy areas became impassable, and steep      grades became untraversable. The first roads (built 3,000      years ago in the Greek islands) were ruts, chiseled into      rock hillsides to guide soil and water carts up to terraced      fields. Today, the same "technology" is used on mountain      logging roads, where ruts are intentionally worn into      curves and grades in order to keep fastmoving,      heavily-loaded trucks on track when mud roads are wet and      slippery. You may find that a rut trail serves just fine      for the four-wheel-drive track out to your back 40. Cut the      trail in late spring in soft, but not soaked soil, and dig      out rocks and roots that are interfering with the ruts.      With steady use, the trail should gradually become      compacted over the summer and fall, and the ruts should      keep you on the road and moving in everything except for      axle-deep mud or deep snow.    </p>    <h3>      All Roads Lead to Rome    </h3>    <p>      Romans were the preeminent road builders of the ancient      world. The illustration shows a cross-section of a typical      Roman road. A stone footing, compacted gravel or rubble      interior, and a cobble surface remained firm in wet weather      but would not turn to dust on dry days. Sides were ditched      to carry off water, and culverts and bridges were built      over dips to carry water under the road. Cobble surfaces      were fine for foot-Legions but too bumpy for wheeled      vehicles, and construction was (forced) labor-intensive. In      the 19th century, J. J. Mac Adam designed British roads      with smoother surfaces that could be built quickly and      economically by freemen and draft animals. Not oiled or      asphalted like modern <em>macadam</em> roads, the top was      of fine crushed rock that compacted with use to shed water,      but would not become too dusty in the summer. The road was      domed and ditched to carry off rain. Although modern      highways have a deeper multi-level foundation and solid      asphalt or concrete surface, they are really not much      different from Mac Adam's original design.    </p>    <h3>      Modern-Day Drives    </h3>    <p>      For your own drive, it's doubtful that you'll want to bury      stone blocks Roman-style. You'll want to adopt Mac Adam's      formula of digging out topsoil and laying in a      well-ditched, contiguous-ribbon wedge of adhesive soil and      rocks, compacted to repel water and topped so it won't      grind to dust.    </p>    <p>      I'll warn you now that this article covers only drives of      forgiving natural materials, which homeowners can design,      build, and maintain at reasonable costs. I've seen too many      amateur-laid thin, unreinforced concrete drives crack, and      too many asphalt drives go gummy and sprout grass because      they weren't rolled and the underlayment wasn't salted. Oh,      there is a cold-set, water-mix asphalt you can buy in drums      or pickup-truck lots, but it is suitable for walkways at      best. Preparing a rolled gravel surface for hot-top or      laying forms for concrete - and then trying to lay      transit-mixed concrete or      stick-to-everything-but-the-gravel asphalt so it turns out      uniformly smooth - is no job for an amateur. If you      want an asphalt or concrete drive, save your pennies, look      in the Yellow Pages ...and have pros do the whole job.    </p>    <h3>      Time to Start Planning    </h3>    <p>      The first step is to design (or redesign) your drive so      that it will handle modern vehicular traffic. The drives of      old country homes were designed for horses and wagons. They      are narrow, have tight curves, and negotiate hills too      abruptly for modern vehicles, so these old drives need to      be broadened and have their transitions eased.    </p>    <p>      When you buy a new home, layout of the drive should be a      major factor in the location and orientation of house and      outbuildings. Walk the land until you know every dense      stand of mature trees, every stream, wet spot, and rock      outcropping. Then using a plat or survey map (if you have      one), or paying for a topographical survey if you must,      draw a detailed map of the land. Toy around with      alternative layouts - avoiding as many hazards as you      can. The more time you spend with paper and pencil, the      easier time you will have when you go to lay out the drive.    </p>    <p>      Few of us have much choice when it comes to the compass      direction that our drive faces and the terrain that it will      traverse. If you do have an option, pick a southern      exposure which will melt snow and dry quickly. Don't build      a drive along the route of prevailing winds; it can become      an expressway for cold blasts in winter and dust devils in      summer.    </p>    <p>      If the drive is long and must run over extreme or complex      elevations, across year-round streams or swamps - or      must be blasted through rock ledge - you are in for a      major expense. If this is the case, you are best advised to      hire a civil engineer to lay it out for you. If your drive      is short or on land with a gentle grade and easy rise and      fall, you can do your own planning and layout on-site. Your      strong back or a good heavy-equipment operator can do the      rest.    </p>    <h3>      Watch Out for Traffic    </h3>    <p>      Traffic safety comes first, and you must locate and design      the driveway entrance to offer ample visibility. Be certain      that you check with the town clerk for local regulations.      But in a typical rural jurisdiction, the view from the      drive (its <em>aspect</em> ) must offer a clear view of      oncoming vehicles for 500 feet in both directions on a      highway carrying high-velocity (over 50 mph) traffic; and      for 100 feet if it is a low-speed road.    </p>    <p>      To evaluate aspect, sink sticks at each side of your drive      entry so that their tops are four to five feet above the      road surface. Measuring from the center of the drive along      the road, set one stick to your <em>right</em> on the      <em>far side</em> of the road, and the other to the      <em>left</em> on <em>your side</em> of the road. Check      aspect as though you were sitting in a vehicle with its      front bumper 10 feet back from the road edge. If you can      remove trees or other obstructions to better see the stick      tops and you can open a clear vista between them, get out      the chain saw. If sharp curves, immovable terrain, or      buildings preclude a safe aspect, then you're going to have      to redesign or relocate the drive. If on a sharp curve, you      may be able to widen or branch the entry, or you can build      a one-way drive across the curve to provide an acceptable      aspect at each end. If you cannot come up with a suitable      plan, you may need a variance. Again, go and see the town      clerk.    </p>    <h3>      The Driveability Factor    </h3>    <p>      Your second consideration should be driveability. The drive      must provide safe, easy access for a motor vehicle from the      road to the house (and back) in all weather. You'll want      space for two vehicles to pass each other at the entry, at      the house end, and on blind curves (at least). Zoning      regulations will stipulate the width of your drive and its      grade for a minimum distance beyond the curb cut. A typical      one-vehicle drive is eight to 10 feet wide (12 feet is      better) with a grade of no more than two percent at the      entry - that is, rising no more than two feet in 100      feet of length - and a grade of no more than eight      percent thereafter (and five percent is better). Unless you      want to burn out your clutch, a maximum grade is 15      percent. Curves should be gradual - arcs of a circle      with a radius of at least 24 feet. A 48-foot turning radius      is better (and essential if you want a moving van or UPS      truck to get in and out).    </p>    <h3>      The Ins and Outs of It    </h3>    <p>      Third comes "returnability." A two-car drive between two      curb cuts gives the best in-and-out access, if topography      and finances permit. Lacking that possibility, the longer      the drive, the more you will need ample parking and      turn-around space for your car, for the pickup, and for      party guests ...but most important, for an ambulance or      fire truck. Consider a turning circle, a rectangular      parking area, or parking-turnaround "T" at the drive's end.      Turnaround posed very few problems with our own drive. The      carriage yard behind the house provided ample space and      needed only a length of perforated pipe to drain it and a      good layer of solid fill to raise and firm it.    </p>    <h3>      The Beauty of Curves    </h3>    <p>      Last comes beauty. Most old-time country drives take the      shortest route from road to barn - usually a straight      line at a flat 90° to the road. Curves and angled      approaches tender more of a welcome, however. If carefully      planned and planted, a curved drive will shield your home      from public view, even if buildings are close to the road.      If you have the space, build in a gentle curve or two even      if the terrain doesn't necessarily demand it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>If carefully planned, a curved drive<br />      will shield your home from public<br />      view, even if buildings are close<br />      to the road.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Layout and Stake-Out</strong>    </p>    <p>      Get a 100-foot length of stout cord and reels of      fluorescent, gummed tape in two colors. Mark the cord with      a tape flag every 10 feet. At 24 and 48-foot points (to      gauge turning radius) flag with another color. Cut a      six-foot stake and tape it at one-foot intervals,      alternating contrasting colors. Finally, cut a supply of      two-foot stakes and tape the tops of them for easy      visibility in thick cover or grass. You'll need a line      level as well.    </p>        <p>      The safest approach angle from road to drive is a flat      90°. The opening into the road should flare gradually      and evenly on each side so that it will at least double the      drive's width. This will allow for easy turns in and out.      Stake out both sides of your entry in fair curves by      setting out stakes every five feet. Then run a stake line      up the center of the drive - stakes every 20 feet on      the flat, every six feet around curves, and at the top of      all nobs and knolls.    </p>    <p>      The rules are simple. Try to maintain a constant fall      - as uniform a grade as possible - of between      two and five percent. To maintain grade on a steep slope,      run the drive back and forth along the face of the slope,      doing your best to locate curves where the hill levels out.      If you must contend with a steep rise, try to have the      sharpest portion of the grade at the top of the drive (so      you can make a running start to crest it in slippery      weather).    </p>    <p>      To gauge grade, have a helper run the line out 50 (or 100)      feet and place it on the ground. Attach the line level,      pull the line tight, and level at your marked stake. If the      line hits the one-foot (2') mark you have a two-percent      grade; at the 2 1/2 ft (5') mark you have a five-percent      grade.    </p>        <p>      Use the 24- and 48-foot marks on the line to lay out      curves. Describe both size circles on flat land to get an      idea of the extremes, and estimate them out on the land,      checking later with the line (placed at the imaginary      center of the circle described by your curve). Make the      curves as fair - as near to the arc of a perfect      circle - as you can.    </p>    <p>      As you encounter low nobs and shallow dips, run the line      along the top of the rises. The road will be evened out as      nobs are cut and dips are filled with the spoil. If a      driveable grade or a fair curve requires cutting out the      side of a large soil bank, the spoil can be used to fill      dips or extend the roadway off to the side. The bare soil      walls can be planted with trees and grass or buttressed      with a terrace or retaining wall. (See illustration "Cuts      and Fills" ) Terraces and retaining walls can be built out      of timbers, rock, or of precast, interlocking concrete      posts. But every cubic yard of spoil taken out must have      somewhere to go, and its removal takes time and money.      Every layer of fill needs compacting - but may still      settle and need to be topped up. Avoid as much subsoil      removal as you can, even if it means a longer drive.    </p>    <h3>Paving a Clear Way</h3>     <p>      Finally, if you are breaking a new trail in heavy cover,      you'll need to clear the land. Trees must be felled, limbs      must be pulled to the side, and brush must be cut and      removed along the drive and for at least 10 feet to each      side. Make this a two-goals-in-one job: Cut, split, and      stack trees and large brush into next year's firewood.      Stumps will have to come outa job for a bulldozer, unless      you want to spend days digging, chopping, and levering each      one. A motorized brush cutter will make the job of clearing      grass and small brush easier. With the land open, cut more      stakes and run stake lines up both sides of the new drive.    </p>    <h3>Building It</h3>      <p>      With enough time, a strong back, a shovel, and garden cart,      you can build your own drive and compact it in thin layers      with your truck or rented water-filled roller. When my      friend Dean Leith Jr. was sales manager for a tiller maker,      he built a driveway on his farm by cutting out topsoil with      a big rear-tined tiller, moving soil out and then moving      garden cart-loads of crushed rock in (with the help of a      tillers' dozer blade). It's faster and a whole lot easier      to hire a bulldozer to cut, fill, and compact, a tractor      with a bucket loader, a backhoe to move soil and ditch, and      dump trucks to haul. Either way, the steps are the same: 1.      Cut out organics-rich topsoil; 2. Grade and compact the      subsoil footing; 3. Add and compact a good-draining base;      4. Top off with a water-repellant surface; 5. Ditch.    </p>    <h3>The Heart of Your Drive</h3>     <p>      The heart of your drive is the footing or base which must      either drain naturally or raise the road surface high      enough so that water won't saturate it. Well-draining      subsoils such as sandy gravel or loam (a sand/silt/clay      mix) need only be compacted when they've been used as fill      and topped with a 6- to 8-inch surface layer of crushed      rock or clay/gravel mix. Fine-particled clay and silt soils      drain slowly, and often need a foot or more of base under      the topping to make sure your drive won't turn to mush.      Sand soils drain well, but they often provide so poor a      footing that they must be dug out and replaced with gravel      or crushed rock or mixed with a binding agent to form      soil-cement. Here is where the local road boss can be of      the utmost help.    </p>    <p>      Your road boss can advise you on the suitability of your      soil, how much base is needed, and how the drive should be      ditched. In addition, he can offer advice on availability      and cost of suitable materials. Crushed rock and bank-run      gravel are available in most places; cinders or slag,      crushed coral or sea shells are found in specific areas.      Or, you may learn that a few extra inches of your local      soil will form a perfectly fine driveway if compacted and      topped properly.    </p>    <h3>Installation Procedures</h3>    <p>      For installing a new drive on an average-draining soil,      remove sod or forest loam, as well as the upper three to      six inches of rich top soil (used for landscaping by      commercial road-builders; you might save yours for a      raised-bed garden). Grade and compact subsoil. Then lay on      base material as needed: the best material being 1 to      1/2"-size rock or gravel in a layer three to 12 inches      thick, as subsoil drainage requires. Estimate that a cubic      yard will cover approximately 100 square feet, three inches      deep. A dump truck will back in, then drive ahead, raising      its bed as it goes to distribute each layer. Layers must      then be spread evenly, graded level, and compacted before      another layer is applied. Patience is a key ingredient at      this point. You can spread and grade a short drive in      sections (by eye) with a rake and a pair of lines stretched      on stakes - a level line stretched across the road      and a grade line stretched up and down its length. Compact      with repeated passes over the entire surface, (not just      over a pair of tire tracks) with a well-loaded pickup      truck.    </p>    <p>      As the base is laid and compacted, it should be domed      - graded at a slight angle to each side of the      midline - to drain well. Then an inch or more layer      of topping is laid. Small-size crushed rock is arguably the      best. It will not shift or roll as will gravel, it compacts      well to shed water and does not grind to dust. Small      cinders, crushed coral, "coquina" limestone and sea shell      drive toppings are locally available. Fine (under-one-inch)      gravel is good once it is ground well into the under layer.      Deposits of clayey small-gravel or weathered shale are      available in some areas, known by such names as "greystone"      or "redstone" Adhesive and nearly waterproof if put down in      thin layers, each are compacted well, and since they are      used as they come out of the pit, they are relatively      cheap.    </p>    <p>      We solved our drive problem by having enough local      rotten-shale "mudstone" hauled in to fill the dips, broaden      the drive a foot, and widen the entry by half again. Just      don't top your drive with six inches of pea gravel that I      used once in my very early days as a country householder. A      thin scattering looks good on a bare dirt drive, but a      thick layer just rolls over itself and causes endless      traction problems. After the truck swam through the stuff      for a month like a lost ship on the sea, I swallowed my      pride and had it scraped off and hauled away.    </p>    <h3>Allowing for Drainage</h3>     <p>      The rain that flows off your drive has to go somewhere or      the drive will waterlog and turn to mud. Where the drive is      flat, dig a two-foot-deep trench along each side. Pour a      gravel bed and then set in a perforated drainage pipe or      drain tiles, surrounding each joint with tarpaper. Cover      with coarse gravel and top with excavated soil. Be sure the      drainpipe slopes down as it runs, and that it empties into      the roadside ditch well below your drive surface.    </p>    <p>      Open ditches along each side of the drive - bottoms      the better part of a foot lower than both the road surface      and the surrounding ground - are better (and easier)      for sloping drives and cuts. (Most fills will slope to each      side and drain naturally.) Make ditches a foot or more      wide, as deep narrow ditches ask for rapid water flow and      erosion. Prevent erosion in steep ditching by laying in      rock sides and bottoms. Or build a series of baffle dams of      rocks or logs, held up by lengths of pipe hammered into the      ground.    </p>    <h3>Installing Culverts</h3>     <p>      Install culverts to channel water beneath the drive and to      run the drive across the roadside ditch. The simplest way      is to lay in tarred corrugated steel tubing (of a size      appropriate to the depth and width of the ditch) and build      the drive over it. Lay soil around the culvert in thin      layers, compacting each by hand. If your area is prone to      gulley washers, get really big culverts even if you need      them only a few times a year. Avoid the most common mistake      of home road-builders: Don't get culverts too small or set      them so shallow that a heavy flow of water will undermine      or overflow the tubing. A heavy rain can carry it away,      leaving you with a flowing ditch at the foot of your drive.    </p>    <p>      Sink culverts deep enough below the ditch bottom or creek      bed so that the water can lay an inch or two of gravel bed      at their bottom. Culvert is available in sizes ranging from      a few inches to several feet in diameter, with cost      appropriate to size. When we broadened the entry of our own      drive, I had to extend the existing foot-diameter culvert      by four feet to the east. But I managed to scavenge a      length of pipe from materials discarded when a local      highway was broadened.    </p>    <p>      You can buy precast end-baffles for smaller-sized culverts      to keep the drive from falling out, to help keep the      culvert in place, and to break the force of occasional      floods. It is better road craft, however, to dry-lay stone      buttresses around each end of a culvert. The stonework      looks better than a plastic or concrete flange or the tip      of a bare metal pipe. It adds a finishing touch to the      drive.    </p>    <h3>Dealing With Sinkholes</h3>   <p>      Most muddy spots can be cured by raising, compacting, and      ditching the drive. But where rainwater stands in a pit, or      groundwater bubbles up in a perennial or wet-season      periodic spring, you have a sinkhole that must be bridged      or drained. Our own sinkhole is only six feet long; while      it is dry for most of the year, ground water wells up to      within six inches of drive level for one week each spring.      A neighbor solved a similar problem by cutting out mud in      order to accept a couple of tons of inch-thick boiler plate      he had delivered, and dropped in place by a rigger.    </p>    <p>      I chose to do it the old-fashioned-way - building a      mini-corduroy road over a Roman-style rock footing. I      hacked out the muddy area (with a pick mattock) down about      18 inches so that it revealed the spring, which indeed      flowed slowly off to the East; it just rose too near the      surface. I spaced good-size rocks about an inch apart in      the bottom of the spring, and then I filled the spaces      between them with large gravel in order to keep the water      flowing. Over the rock I laid a foot-thick mat of      six-foot-long sapling poles, and oriented up and down the      drive. Over this, I laid cross-drive poles, and then topped      it all with gravel, and kept throwing on gravel as we drove      over and compacted the road. I anticipate having to add      gravel each year... and periodically having to dig out and      rebuild the whole thing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Don't let something as<br />      comparatively minor as a driveway dampen      your<br /> joy... plan and build your<br />      drive well.</strong>    </p>    <h3>Corduroy and Other Styles</h3>     <p>      What I built was a small version of the floating mat road      that has been used for centuries to bridge swamps and bogs.      If you have a section of undrainable marsh or mud hollow to      traverse, you might build a larger rendition. The      time-tested method that resembles one (a thousand years      old) found in Europe, is to interweave a road-size mat of      thin branches in an alternating fore-and-aft / side-to-side      cross-hatch pattern over the marsh. Stake each layer into      the mud with down-forking branches. When the mat floats      enough to support your weight without bouncing, lay on      6"-thick logs, butted tight together across the road. More      poles can be nailed lengthwise to the bottom layer; a third      layer can be spiked on top of that (crosswise) for a bumpy,      corduroy effect. For a smoother road surface, spike on      thick oak planks from a local lumber mill (if you can      afford them).    </p>    <p>      Another solution for a mudhole is to drain it into a      drywell. Dig down a foot or more and lay perforated      drainage pipe or tile along the drive's wettest edge in      order to collect the water. Connect it with a "T" fitting      or bend it to a length of pipe laid in a down-sloping ditch      to a low, dry area. There, dig a pit four feet or more down      into the subsoil. Fill with gravel, top with tamped down      excavated soil. If the pipe enters the drywell at a level      below the drainage tile, you should have a dry drive.    </p>    <h3>Maintenance and Good Grooming</h3>    <p>      Keep your drive in condition by grooming it frequently.      Rake tire-thrown surface gravel from the sides and      mid-ridge onto wheel tracks and into small pits in order to      keep potholes or corduroy ridges from developing. Fill      small pools of standing water after heavy rains, cutting      small channels to the drive side to drain them if need be.      If the drive deteriorates to ruts over the winter, rototill      it to a depth of six inches with spring-toothed pick tines      (available as accessories for your own or a rented      large-size rototiller). Or, have it groomed with the road      crew's power rake (don't have it scraped). Then compact it      evenly, add another inch or two of topping, and see if      drainage can be improved.    </p>    <h3>Last Words of Warning</h3>    <p>      Finally, if you are in the early phases of picking that      perfect spot for your new country home, factor in the      feasibility and cost of building a country-practical drive.      Down the mountain from us, a steep hillside has been      subdivided into narrow minimum-frontage lots. Lacking ample      lot width for gently rising, curved driveways, the      fresh-from-town homeowners find their deeply cut      switch-back drives washing out after heavy rains (one      downhill drive at the bottom of a two-mile hill road      becomes a virtual torrent after every thunderstorm). Not      even a plow-equipped 4x4 pickup can bull its way up their      steep drives through heavy, mid winter wet snow. So,      following every blizzard, our new neighbors' vehicles      cluster at drive entries, as they shovel for hours or      struggle up and down slope with snow-blowers which are      better suited to flat, paved suburban driveways. "For Sale"      signs are beginning to pop up. Don't let something as      comparatively minor as a driveway dampen your joy of      country living ...plan and build your drive well.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Preventing Washout on Hills      </h3>      <p>        The main problem on a hill drive (no matter how much or        little rain will fall there) is a periodic overdose of        water which will use your drive as a channel and wash        out. If you have no choice but to build a steep drive,        you can keep it passable ...with effort.      </p>      <p>        Drive construction is conventional; cut and fill as        needed to attain the best grades and easiest curves.      </p>      <p>        Put ample rock-lined or baffle-darned ditches on both        sides of the drive. Over knobs, deepen the ditches enough        so that they maintain a steady down-grade, and install        drain tile in a gravel bed at the bottoms.      </p>      <p>        You may be able to divert water by cutting ditches above        the drive and leading them downhill in another direction        - in effect, creating a new stream bed. Be sure to        clear these ditches frequently. Perennial sod and forest        roots will choke them quickly.      </p>      <p>        If a drive cuts sharply around the hill you may have to        install a culvert under the drive from the uphill to the        downhill ditch to prevent rushing water from eroding the        inner drive margain. In dips, you may also have to run        culverts or drain tile from the ditch to the outer slope        of the hill.      </p>      <p>        Finally, if the hill dumps more water on your drive than        the ditches or culverts can handle, you may have to dig a        sump on the uphill side of the drive just below the spot        where the water courses converge. Sink a well about a        yard across and four feet deep. From the well bottom, dig        a trench across the drive so it opens out on the        downslope. Lay a culvert or iron pipe in the trench from        sump to outlet, refill, and compact. Line the well with        rock or brick and cover with a metal sewer grating or        install parallel pipes at the top to keep forest trash        from clogging the pipe. Keep the grill clear and the sump        should keep your drive from washing out.      </p>      <h3>A Country Town's Zoning        Regulations</h3>         <p>        The following are regulations in a typical country town:      </p>      <p>        <em>Plan Approval:</em> by highway superintendent before        building permit granted; drive must be completed and        signed off before Occupancy Permit granted.      </p>      <p>        <em>Visibility:</em> Clear line-of-sight to 5 feet stakes        placed at roadside 200 ft. in either direction upon town        road.      </p>      <p>        <em>Setback:</em> Fifteen feet from property lines.      </p>      <p>        <em>Grade:</em> Minimum of five percent for 20 feet        beyond point where drive intesects with ditch line of        Town Road.      </p>      <p>        <em>Access:</em> Entry, grade and turns adequate for        emergency vehicles. Minimum width of ten feet. If drive        is over 150 ft. long, turnarounds must be adequate for        1-Ton truck.      </p>      <p>        <em>Drainage:</em> Construction must minimize drainage        problems onto adjacent properties. Drainage ditches and        roadside culverts to be approved by Highway        Superintendent; their construction and maintenance is the        responsibility of property owner.      </p>    </div>
