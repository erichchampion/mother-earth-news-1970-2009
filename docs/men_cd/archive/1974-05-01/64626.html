                <p>      <strong>Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when      there were <em>NO</em> currently relevant      small-scale-farming introductory handbooks available, many      of us welcomed the publication of Richard Langer's <em>Grow      It!</em> with open arms. Now that we're all older and more      experienced, however, some folks find it increasingly easy      to criticize that breakthrough beginner's guide (see the      <em>Feedback</em> sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and      25).</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Which brings us to another breakthrough book that      is just as important (probably more so) now as <em>Grow      It!</em> was two years ago . . . and which may well come up      for its share of criticism in another 24 months or      so.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Be that as it may, John and Sally Seymour's record      of 18 successful years on a shirttail-sized homestead in      England is important now and should offer welcome      encouragement to today's back-to-the-landers . . . both      real and imaginary. I started serializing the book in my      No. 25 issue and I'm sure that many readers will want a      personal copy for their home      libraries.-MOTHER.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Copyright © 1973 by John and Sally Seymour.

When you get a cow you immediately find the      pace of all your other smallholding activities will be      forced on. To feed the cow you will have to grow fodder. To      use up the manure from the cow you will have to dig or      plough more land. To use up milk by-products, such as      skimmed milk or whey, you will have to keep other small      stock-probably pigs. Your pigs will then produce even      more manure and you will feel like ploughing more land.      Besides, you will need to grow crops for the pigs. You will      have calves to dispose of-what will you do with them?      Your cow will go dry one day and you will need another cow      to fill in the gap. Then the time will come when both cows      are in milk. Unless you are part of a community you will      then have too much milk. What do you do then-put the      two calves on one cow and milk the other? Whatever you do      you will find the purchase of a cow will push on the pace      of your other self-supporting activities. It will save, at      a stroke, possibly more money than anything else. Butter      and cheese go up and up in price.    </p>    <p>      But think hard about it. A cow is the biggest tie in the      world. You will have to milk her twice a day and you will      be very lucky to find somebody to stand in for you. Very      few people in this world <em>can</em> milk. I would say      that, unless you are fully determined to spend all of your      life at home, or only go away at rare intervals when you      can either get somebody else to look after your cow or else      board her in their herd ('meat for manners'-in other      words-they keep her and they get the milk), or unless      you are part of a community, you should think loud and      often before getting a cow.    </p>    <p>      But a cow is a very gentle, beautiful creature, and you can      get very fond of her and derive much enjoyment from her.      And you and your children can also derive much help. We      have never been without a cow, in milk, these last fifteen      years.    </p>    <h3>      FEEDING    </h3>    <p>      A cow can theoretically be kept on an acre of grass, but I      would far rather have two cows on five acres. By flogging      grass with nitrogenous fertilizer I think you could keep a      cow on an acre during the summertime, but you would not be      able to cut hay on it as well.    </p>    <p>      A cow needs at least a ton of hay every winter. You might      get this off half an acre. If you can't grow it you can buy      it. There is something to be said for buying in your hay      and straw, if you have to buy anything. Farmers say when a      man buys hay he buys land, and this is so in two ways. One      way is that he thus spares his own land to feed animals or      grow other crops. The other is that to buy hay is to buy      fertility, and the best sort of fertility too: the kind      that improves the land permanently, and brings you returns      year after year. For every ton of hay or straw that comes      on to your land stays there, in the beneficient form of      muck, and improves the humus status of your soil. So if you      wish to keep cows but have not got enough land, remedy this      by buying in hay from other people. If you have      weatherproof storage for the hay you can best buy it      straight from the field, just after it has been baled. That      is when it will be cheapest.    </p>    <p>      In the summer the cow will live, and give you plenty of      milk, on grass, and grass alone. That is provided she has      enough grass and it is of good quality. In the winter      though she will need supplementary feeding or she will not      give you very much milk. A dry cow or a bullock may very      well live out all winter on good grass without any      supplementary feeding except a little hay if it snows, but      a cow in milk needs food, and her milk yield will reflect      very sensitively how much food she is getting. The aim of      the modern agri-businessman is to get the highest milk      yield possible, and he feeds his milking cows on a very      rich diet, mostly of bought-in cake. The self-supporter may      not wish to get so much milk out of his cow or cows, and      will be content with a lower standard of feeding. His cows      will be the healthier for this: it is the 'steaming up', or      very high-level feeding, to exact bigger and bigger milk      yields, that causes so much disease in modern dairy cows.      The nearer you can keep to nature-that is to the      conditions for which cattle were bred by natural selection      when they were in the wild state-the less disease you      will have. You must depart from nature to some extent or      you won't get much milk, but it is a matter of departing      from it in moderation.    </p>    <p>      The traditional way of feeding dairy cows is to give each      cow a maintenance ration, which is calculated to be enough      to keep her in fit bodily condition but not to produce any      milk, and then on top of that a production ration according      to how much milk she will give. Thus twenty pounds of good      hay are considered a production ration for a Friesian cow      for a day (less for a Jersey), less hay plus some roots      will do, or some of the hay can be replaced by good oat      straw supplemented by roots. Thirty to fifty pounds of      roots a day, plus perhaps ten to fifteen pounds of hay,      would be a maintenance ration.    </p>    <p>      Your production ration is generally given in the form of      concentrates: that is corn or 'cake'. Cake is nutritious      matter made by compounders in huge mills and comes in paper      sacks and is very expensive. If you allow three and a half      pounds of a good average cake per gallon of milk that your      cow is giving in the winter you will not be far wrong. But      to be truly self-supporting you will not wish to buy in      cake. The only thing you can do then is to grow plenty of      fodder crops (roots and brassica), and corn and beans. A      mixture of ground oats, barley and field beans, with      possibly a sprinkling of some proprietary mineral mixture,      or seaweed meal if you like (which has all the necessary      mineral), fed at the rate of three and a half pounds per      gallon, would not be far off. But the temptation for the      overworked man on a smallholding is to buy cake and pay up      and look pleasant-and hope to pay the mill bill with      money got from the sale of calves or surplus stock. And      this should be feasible.    </p>    <h3>      BREEDS    </h3>    <p>      Now for the question of what sort of cow to get, and how to      get her. Jerseys are beautiful and very docile (ours came      in the house one day and ate a number of corn dollies that      Sally had been making for sale). They would happily live in      the living room with you, if you allowed them. In India      cows of course do, with mutual benefit to the cows and the      people. Jerseys give superb milk: the richest in the world,      averaging five percent butter fat. They have one big      disadvantage for our purpose: their bull calves are almost      worthless. The heifer calves can be reared up, of course,      and sold for dairy herd replacements, or taken into your      own herd. The bull calves however are not worth rearing up,      commercially at any rate. The fat of the Jersey is      yellowish and the animals do not put much meat on. If you      serve your Jersey cow with an Angus* bull you will get a      slightly better 'butcher's animal' but the butcher can      still spot that it is half Jersey and will not give you      much for it at any age. We keep a Jersey or two and what we      do is to rear up one bull calf a year, keep him until two      years old, and then send him off to the slaughterhouse to      be killed for our own use; but more of this in the chapter      about meat. The meat of the Jersey is very good      incidentally-and what if the fat does look slightly      yellow? Who are we to be colour prejudiced?    </p>    <p>      The Guernsey gives a little more milk than the Jersey,      slightly less rich, is slightly hardier, and the bull      calves are slightly less objectionable to the butcher. They      still bear the stigma 'Channel Island' though, and won't      fetch much.    </p>    <p>      The Friesian is the most widespread breed in the Western      world today, and almost the only breed beloved of      agri-businessmen. It gives an enormous amount of milk of      low quality and crosses very well indeed with the Hereford      bull or bulls of other breeds (nowadays often Charollais)      to make an ox beloved of graziers and butchers. Most of the      beef eaten in the Western world today comes from this      source: the steers are a by-product of the milk industry.      Even a pure-bred Friesian, although a dairy breed and not a      beef breed, makes a very acceptable butcher's animal. The      Friesian is big, and eats a lot more than, say, a Jersey,      but gives a lot more milk.    </p>    <p>      The Ayrshire is something like the Friesian, although      smaller, and with slightly more butter fat in the milk. She      is very hardy. Not a good butcher's animal.    </p>    <p>      The Welsh Black is a fine animal and one I should say      ideally suited for the self-supporter. Crossed with the      Hereford she throws a fine beef calf, and she gives a fair      amount of good milk. She is superlatively hardy, and most      unlikely to go wrong.    </p>    <p>      The Shorthorn is a fine dual-purpose animal, hardy, quite      good milk, good beef or beef cross. The Dairy Shorthorn      has, alas, almost died out in Britain, and the Beef      Shorthorn is not as widespread as it was. But occasional      Shorthorn-type animals can be bought from small farmers,      and very good they are too.    </p>    <p>      Of the beef breeds, the Hereford is supreme, for he      impresses his coloration (the famous white head) and      configuration on other breeds of cow, and the butchers love      him and his progeny. The Hereford bull, incidentally, is      the gentlest of creatures. The Jersey bull, in sharp      contradiction to the Jersey cow-that sweetest of      animals-is a little sod. Many a man has been killed by a      Jersey bull.    </p>    <p>      The Aberdeen-Angus is also a fine beef breed, producing,      with the Galloway, most of the fine beef that comes out of      Scotland. It is a little animal, and thus fine for crossing      with the Jersey. Its progeny are slower-maturing than the      progeny of the Hereford.    </p>    <p>      The Charollais I know little about. It is said to be      quicker maturing than our beef breeds, and to make a very      fine beef animal, with a big proportion of expensive meat      to cheap. Here in Pembrokeshire it does not seem to be so      popular, and much of the hullabaloo which heralded its      appearance in the U.K. his died down. It was to make      millionaires of every one of us.    </p>    <p>      <em>*A Charollais is even better.</em>    </p>    <h3>      BREEDING AND CALVES    </h3>        <p>      To get your cows in calf, you either borrow a bull, have      one of your own, unfortunately leave the gate open (by      mistake) so that your neighbour's bull unfortunately gets      through it and serves your cow (in which case you hide your      delight and chide your neighbour for not keeping his bull      under control), or you get the 'A.I. Man'. A.I. is      artificial insemination. It is cheap ($3.25 at the moment),      easy and effective. If you have only a handful of cows it      is a very good way. The calves are no better and no worse      than calves got by any other method, except that they are      better in so far as A.I. is able to afford the best bulls      in the world.    </p>    <p>      The disadvantage of A.I., though, is that if you have a      number of cows and they are running out loose, you can't      always 'spot' them when they are bulling, or on heat. A cow      shows that she is bulling by mounting other cows in a      lesbian fashion, or standing while they mount her, by      bellowing, and by discharging at the rear. She must be      caught immediately and served the next day. Immediately you      see her you must telephone the 'A.I. Man' (Milk Marketing      Board). He will come next morning. But if you are not      constantly vigilant you can miss a cow, in which case you      will have to wait exactly three weeks, when you hope she      will show signs of bulling again. Having your own bull      guards against such delay: your bull will know if a cow is      bulling or not. But a bull would only be justified if you      had quite a large herd of cattle: certainly not less than a      dozen.    </p>    <p>      The cow gestates for 280 days, or about nine months. In      this, as in many other things, she resembles the female of      <em>Homo sapiens.</em> We like our calves to be born out of      doors, in clean pasture, winter or summer. We leave well      alone unless the cow has serious trouble and we      <em>have</em> to interfere. Don't interfere until the cow      has been in labour herself for several hours. Then, if you      must, roll your sleeve up, douse your hand and forearm with      carbolic oil, and gently dive in to see what is wrong. The      calf may be wrongly presented, in which case you must move      it about in the womb until it is rightly presented:      preferably with its fore-legs poking out first with its      nose between them (the normal way) or, at a pinch, a      'breach' presentation-arse first. If the presentation      is normal, fore-legs first, but if the cow simply cannot      get rid of the calf because he is too big, gently pull his      fore-feet out, tie a cord on to them, and pull gently but      firmly-and pull <em>only</em> when the cow is      straining. Sometimes you end up by having to pull pretty      hard, but don't pull harder than you have to. The above      advice applies to sheep or horses too, incidentally. But if      animals are kept as naturally as possible, running out in      the open, not too fat or overfed, you should have no      trouble at all. Generally what happens is that you go out      to look at the old girl in the morning and there she      is-standing up with a dear little calf sucking from her and      she is licking its tail.    </p>    <p>      Don't be, afraid of her. She may look worried but if she      knows you she won't butt you. Pick the calf up and carry it      gently in front of the cow, stopping to let the cow smell      the calf at frequent intervals, and the cow should follow      you, and get them- both into the shed.    </p>    <p>      There are now many schools of thought as to what you should      do next. Some people say take the calf right away from the      mother and never let the two animals see each other again.      We have never been able to bring ourselves to do this. The      proponents of this method say that the cow will settle down      to being milked by human or machine much quicker, and will      forget the calf very quickly. Well, if you do this, you      don't have my blessing.    </p>    <p>      Another way is to leave the calf and cow together for three      or four days, or a week, not milking the cow yourself so      that the calf gets a 'good start', and then separate them.      When you do, both cow and calf will make the welkin ring      with their bellows for two or three nights, and the cow may      kick a bit when you milk her, and may not be too keen to      let her milk down. Persevere.    </p>    <p>      Yet another method is to keep the cow away from the calf      most of the time, then let the calf suck when you bring the      cow in for milking until his belly is full, then take him      away and get the rest of the milk out yourself. You may      have trouble but on the other hand some cows don't mind it      at all: I have a neighbour who milks with the calf sucking      away on one side and himself squatting down milking on the      other. Our cow is now having her fore-teats milked by the      calf and her hind by us, and it is working perfectly.    </p>    <p>      Another way is to let the calf suck, say, once a day and      you milk at the other end of the day. Again, you may      possibly have psychological troubles with the cow, on the      other hand possibly no trouble at all.    </p>    <p>      Probably to remove the calf altogether after a week is the      best method. After a day or two of unsettlement the cow      then settles down to the regime of being milked very      nicely, and you get all the milk.    </p>    <p>      Then what to do with the calf. Well, you have got to feed      the calf either on milk, reconstituted milk powder, or milk      substitute for at least three months, and he will need      about a gallon and a half a day when he gets a little      older, perhaps a gallon a day to start with. Offer very      very good hay to the calf when he is old enough to want it,      and try him with a little concentrates, either ground corn      or calf cake bought from the mill.    </p>    <p>      The moment you take the calf away from the cow you are      going against nature, and you may have to pay the      consequences. The calf may get ill. He will probably show      this by <em>scouring</em> -that is having diarrhoea.      If he has nasty smelly white droppings or blood in his      droppings, send for the vet and no messing. If he just has      pretty stinky diarrhoea, smelling like babies, take him off      milk immediately, make him drink warm water, or warm water      with a little glucose in it, and keep him warm and dry.      Shove some antibiotics into him too: there are several      pills and tablets you can get from the chemists. If you      don't, he will probably die. He will live without milk for      several days, with a little glucose and water, but use      common sense, and when he seems to be better let him have a      little milk diluted with water, then a little milk.    </p>    <p>      Calves should be kept out of draughts, but with fresh air      passing above them, on clean bedding, be gently and kindly      treated, and the apparatus you use to feed them should be      clean and sterilised. The milk you give them should be      body-temperature and fresh. A calf just let to suck      naturally from his mother will almost never go wrong,      particularly if left out of doors. Cows calve high in the      mountains in the bitterest winter and lose hardly any      calves. A calf taken from his mother and fed from a bucket      is very likely to go wrong. The calves that you see at      every cattle mart, or market, being thrown out of the backs      of vans and lorries, dragged about by their tails, flung      into dirty and contaminated pens where they stand in mess      and draught for hours on end with other frightened little      animals, to be auctioned, flung into the back of somebody's      old banger, driven back to a farm, dragged into a stuffy      shed: these calves are fighting for their lives and often      don't bother to fight very hard. I have a neighbour who      buys calves thus, perforce for he has to rear beef for a      living, and I asked him how he got his replacements. 'Buy      them in the mart on Monday', he said, 'put them on      antibiotics on Wednesday, and bury them on Friday.'    </p>    <p>      We've done the same, although Sally is an absolute genius      at nursing little things back to health. But it is a fight,      and the whole system of selling little week-old calves in      the open market should go the way of the      slave-trade-out. It is monstrously cruel and      extremely inefficient. There is a law that these calves      should have a week of their mother's milk before they are      sold. Without the protection of the colostrum-the      medicinal first-milk of their own dam-they are doomed      anyway. But many milk farmers just do not observe the law.      How can anybody know if they have? Dairy farmers want rid      of their calves-quick. They don't want them. This is      why they are taken to the mart, to be sold to specialists,      or smallholders' wives who like to rear a calf or two, and      brought up on the bucket. There should be agencies set up      all over the country, working by telephone, to put such      dairy farmers in touch with calf-rearers-on the same      principle as agencies to supply <em>au pair</em> girls. The      buyer could then go and get the calf straight from the farm      where it was born, make sure that it had been properly      treated, carry it carefully to a nice warm car, drive it      quickly home, and then nurse it. You see, many of the      buyers want to get the calf to put on a cow of their own      who has just calved, on the principle known as multiple      suckling, which we shall deal with in a moment. Such buyers      need a calf, or more, immediately: just when their cow has      calved. If they introduce the calf to her foster mother      immediately after the latter has calved she is far more      likely to take to him.    </p>    <p>      To teach a calf to suck from a bucket we have a thing      called a 'little mother', which is a stainless steel or      aluminum bucket which hangs on the wall and has rubber      teats hanging down from it. When the calf is very young      they must be scrupulously cleaned. The more usual method is      to teach the calf to drink straight out of a bucket. You do      this by grabbing the calf's nose, poking two fingers in his      mouth so that he starts to suck and forcing his nose into      the milk. After a time he discover that thus he can suck      milk besides your fingers. It may be a struggle at first,      and women have got much more patience with small animals      than men, not unnaturally. The great advantage of 'little      mothers' is that they satisfy a calf's desire to suck. If a      calf sucks his milk from a 'little mother' he will not suck      other calves. If he gollops his milk up from a bucket he      will have an insatiable desire to      suck-anything-the navel of another calf (which      can lead to disease), an old dirty rope-end, baling twine,      or the poisonous lead paint off the gate of his stall.    </p>    <p>      When the calf is weaned you can either put him out onto      good clean grass, if it be summertime, but go on feeding      him some concentrates for several weeks, or else keep him      on indoors (you must in the wintertime, and probably should      if it's his first summer) and feed him on roots, good      meadow hay, and perhaps four pounds of concentrates a day:      more the older he gets.    </p>    <p>      The reason why one is worried about letting him out to      grass is because of husk (or hoose). In many parts of the      country the grass is infested with the lung worms of      cattle, and these, if ingested by a young calf, give him      the disease of husk. It makes him cough, he loses      condition, and eventually dies. Why don't calves running      out with their mothers get husk? Well they do, but they      acquire such immunity from their mothers that it does them      little harm. Whatever happens, if you are ever going to let      your calf out of doors to mix with older cattle, he is      going to get husk. The trick is to let him pick it up      slowly, when he is older, in good condition, and well fed.      He will then get an immunity to it before it gets him down.      If you have really clean pasture, that is pasture on which      no older cattle have grazed at least since it was last      ploughed up and re-seeded, put him on that. We tether      calves in our orchard, there is no husk there. Can't      be-no very big cattle ever go there. If you turn      callow young animals straight out into husk-infested      pasture you are heading for very big trouble. You will have      to get the vet, get the animals injected, get them indoors      again and probably keep them indoors, well fed, for another      year. I know-I've had it.    </p>    <p>      While on the subject of calves, there are three other ways      of rearing up calves, and any of them might be useful for      the self-supporter as a source of money income. After all,      the rest of the world has to eat too.    </p>    <p>      The first is single-suckling. You simply let a herd of cows      out onto grass, or rough pasture, with a bull at the right      time of the year. The bull, and the cows, will do the rest.      Take the calves off the cows at six months of age and sell      them in the nearest 'suckled-calf sales'.    </p>    <p>      The second is outdoor multiple suckling. This is very      applicable to the smallholder. Your cow has a calf. You      don't want to milk her. Rush to a neighbour and buy another      newborn calf, put him on your cow with your calf. Keep      watch on them both for a few days, indoors, to make sure      that she has accepted her foster child and is letting him      suck, and then turn them out and, after a little more      vigilance, forget them. She will rear two fine calves for      you, instead of one. This is a very profitable performance.    </p>    <p>      The third method is multiple suckling indoors. It is one      way of cheaply building up a herd, but it requires the      patience of job. When your cow has calved go and buy two or      three newborn calves. Keep them indoors, bring your cow in      twice a day, tie her up, and <em>make</em> her allow the      four little calves to suck (her own and the three others).      She will kick. She will butt. But she can't kick if you      hold her tail up tight in the air and if you put a rope      tightly around her belly and loins, to pass just in front      of her udder. Maybe she'll get tired of it all before you      will. After three months of this, wean those four calves      and put, say, three fresh ones on her, or two, depending on      what condition she is in. After three months wean those and      put one on her. Then dry the poor old thing off and give      her a rest before she calves again. Ain't it a beggar, said      the Queen of Spain. We've done it once but we'll never do      it again.    </p>    <p>      As to the small matter of actually milking your      cow-you do it like this. Pinch the top of a teat      between thumb and forefinger so that the milk cannot escape      from the teat back up into the udder. Then squeeze in a      downwards direction with the rest of the hand.    </p>
