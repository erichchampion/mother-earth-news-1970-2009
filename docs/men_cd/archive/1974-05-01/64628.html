                    <p>      Hogs are about the hardest of all homestead animals to      fence in . . . and small pigs are especially difficult to      hold: They can go over, under or through just about      anything short of a solid board wall once they take it into      their heads to get out.    </p>    <p>      That fact became very real to us last spring, when we      bought a couple of 40-pound feeder pigs. We started out by      making the animals a board pen (three and a half feet high      . . . (to begin with, anyhow) inside the barn. Then we      added an outdoor enclosure of sheep netting which we      salvaged from an old fence row on our place.    </p>    <p>      That was our first big mistake. Sheep netting is no      substitute for hog wire: The mesh is much too large for      pigs. Seems like the little rascals just squirt through      anything they can get their heads into up to the neck. We      couldn't afford to go to town and buy a whole new roll of      the proper fencing . . . so we compromised, got some      two-inch mesh chicken wire and ran it around the sheep      netting for greater strength and rigidity.    </p>    <p>      This precaution only sent the pigs under the wire instead      of through it. We were pretty discouraged until a neighbor      told us to lay logs around the inside of the pen at the      base of the fence so the critters couldn't get their snouts      under the wire and shove on through. That solved the      burrowing problem.    </p>    <p>      The next time the little porkers got out, they went over      the boards of the pen inside the barn. In other words, a      pair of one-foot-tall animals climbed a sheer wooden wall      three and a half times their own height Amazing!    </p>    <p>      Once loose, the feeder hogs rampaged around in the barn,      upsetting feed sacks, plowing through the worm beds beneath      our rabbit hutches and even rooting up chunks of the floor      where the frost had heaved the cement After that, I ran the      sides of their enclosure on up to four and a half feet . .      . a height that proved too much for them.    </p>    <p>      Another neighbor of mine restrains his four pigs with an      electric fence made of two hot wires, one eight inches off      the ground and the other a foot higher. The charger and a      half mile of the smooth strand he uses cost $29.00 and, he      says, "work real well". One especially desirable feature of      such an arrangement is that it's easily moved . . . so you      can shift the hogs to fresh pasture periodically to      eliminate wallows and help cut the feed bill.    </p>    <p>      Once pigs <em>do</em> get out, catching them can be a      frustrating yet rewarding experience . . . but less so with      old hogs than with young. Swine-like      humans-become slaves to habit as they age and prefer      regular meals in familiar surroundings, so their capture is      just a matter of tempting the animals back into their pens      with the feed pan.    </p>    <p>      Young pigs, though, are a whole different ball game.      They're quick, slick and smart . . . and recovering them is      usually a major undertaking. This is especially true in a      sparsely populated area like ours, where a hog can simply      disappear into the woods with little likelihood of being      spotted by a neighbor.    </p>    <p>      Our own problem was all the worse because we bought our      feeders from a farmer who had about ninety other hogs . . .      so the young-which had had little if any individual      attention from their keeper-weren't very tame. Then      our pair were made even wilder by a friend's dog, which      would get into their pen and bark furiously at the porkers.      The dog didn't harm the pigs: Apparently he was fascinated      by those strange creatures and wanted them to play with      him. The poor beasts, of course, didn't understand and were      left trembling with terror. Their skittishness, coupled      with our lack of experience in fencing, led to a three-week      period of liberty for the slippery youngsters.    </p>    <p>      The first rule in catching small pigs is <em>not</em> to      chase them. Running after the animals only makes them      wilder. We didn't know that, however, and when our two got      into the three-acre woods next to our barn we spent the      first week pursuing them back and forth through the brush .      . . with no success at all. Young hogs are quick, and so      low to the ground that there's practically nothing on them      to grab for as they run between your legs (which they will      do). Another of their defenses is to squeal shrilly and      unrelentingly-as if being slaughtered with the      corkscrew of a dull Swiss Army knife-when capture is near.      The sound is so unnerving that it made me let go of the      little fiends several times just as they were within my      grasp.    </p>    <p>      After a week of this, our pigs were like deer. We could      walk within a foot of them in tall grass and they would      stand stock still and silent, completely invisible.    </p>    <p>      I next spent a week or ten days trying to snare the      fugitives out in the woods. First I dug a pit trap four      feet deep, covered with twigs and burlap and baited with a      pan of feed. The hogs fell in half a dozen times, and      climbed out just as often. Then I tried a box trap. . . an      even more dismal failure. It turned out to be too short      and-when triggered-dropped on the backs of the quarry. With      its sides held up that way, it let the pigs right out      again.    </p>    <p>      I finally decided just to feed and water the critters out      in the brush, and to move their rations a little closer to      home every day. This process took another week, until      finally one day I set the pan down <em>inside</em> the      barn. I was standing on the back porch watching the rain      fall when I saw my hogs disappear into their former      quarters through the only open entrance. Jubilantly I      sneaked down and slammed the door before they knew what had      happened. Once more they were domestic pigs.    </p>    <p>      I hope my experience helps some of MOTHER's readers. Happy      hoggin'.    </p>
